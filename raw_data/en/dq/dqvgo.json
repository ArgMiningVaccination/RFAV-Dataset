Total ozone measurements performed at the Light Climatic O b- servatory (LKO) provide a unique data set of continuous reliable measurements going back to the early 1930s. From the present report, we learn that in 1921 the municipality of Arosa (as \"Kur - und Verkehrsverein\") employed Dr. F. W. Paul G\u00f6tz with the task to study the Radiation Climate of Arosa. Soon G\u00f6tz became convinced of the necessity to measure total atmospheric ozone, i.e. the sum of all ozone i n the stratosphere and troposphere, to understand climatology of ultraviolet radiation (UV), which was suspected to be essential for healthy alpine climate. Prior to treatment with modern antibi- otics, lung tuberculosis (LTB) was a major factor for human mortality, and it was believed that a rest cure in the alpine climate strongly improved chances of recovery from LTB. In the years following World War II, when antibiotics became generally available, regular total ozone measurements of LKO needed a new justi fication for society. In looking back, it appears that the continuous high quality measurements of total ozone at LKO is a result of lucky circumstances, but mainly of the strong en-gagement of several personalities. In this context, it is of importance to highlight the merit of Prof. H.U. D\u00fctsch, an earlier student of G\u00f6tz, who played a key role in continuing the total ozone meas- urements. The history of the LKO, though of local nature, reveals important features for reliable global monitor- ing. Satellite m easurements of ozone begun in the late 1970s with continuous measurements assur- ing quasi -global coverage. However, reliable ground- based measurements remain crucial to date in order to guarantee and validate the long- term stability of the satellite data. W hen Molina and Row- land published their work on chlorine catalysed ozone destruction in 1974, they needed numerical modelling to quantify the effect of anthropogenic chemicals destroying stratospheric ozone (termed ODS, Ozone Depletion Substances). Continuous improvement of the numerical simulations led at the beginning of the 1980 to the conclusion that emissions of ODS could indeed lead to substantial dam-age of the ozone layer with detrimental health effects for the global population, unless world- wide emissions were curbed to stabilise ODS at levels of the 1970s. The measurements at the LKO, as longest reliable total ozone series, played a key role to show that the ozone loss in northern mid-latitudes, where the largest fraction of the global population li ves and is exposed to changing UV - doses, was substantially larger than the chemical theory at this time predicted. The total ozone measurements at the LKO had a stake in paving the way towards the signature of \"The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer\" in 1987. The LKO observ a- tions are an integral part of the worldwide Global Atmosphere Watch network of the World Meteor o- logical Organisation, in which the authors of this report were engaged for many years. The Montreal Protocol is an international success story, as catastrophic ozone loss could be avoided. Numerical VI Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) simulations indicate that the extrapolated unlimited increase in ODS emissions would have led to large stratospheric ozone loss, with more than 50% of the stratospheric ozone lost in the second half of this century. However, the careful measurements need to be continued and they are expected to be substantially more challenging as the models predict an increase about three times slower than the decrease in the 1980s, requiring extreme long- term stability of the monitoring data. Recent stud- ies provided evidence that the healing of ozone in certain layers of the stratosphere might be slower than expected, like due to climate change, further highlighting the importance of reliable monitoring. May this report contribute to the awareness of our responsibility for the ozone layer and for continu- ous measurements ensuring its preservation! Prof. Dr. Petteri Taalas Secretary -General World Meteorological Organization Geneva VII Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone mea surements Abstract This document reports on the history of the Light Climatic Observatory (LKO) at Arosa, which spans nearly a century. The LKO was founded in 1921 by F. W. Paul G\u00f6tz who became a leading scientist in ozone research. After his premature death in 1954, the continuation of the ozone measurements was highly uncertain and Hans Ulrich D\u00fctsch, a former graduate student of G\u00f6tz, eventually found a solution to continue the measurement activities at Arosa. He became responsible for the measur e- ments of the LKO in 1962 maintaining and expanding their scope as professor at ETH Z\u00fcrich (1965- 1985). After his retirement (1985) the continuation of the long- term ozone measurements was in danger again until MeteoSwiss assumed overall responsibility for the long- term ozone measur e- ments 1 of the LKO at Arosa in 1988. Only this decision enabled the world's longest total ozone measurement series to be kept alive. From the beginning until today the Arosa total ozone series proved to be particularly valuable to the global ozone community. In addition to total ozone, other valuable (long- term) ozone measurements are available from the LKO, such as the Umkehr series starting in 1956 as well as useful and representative surface ozone measurement s 2. The operational performance of long- term measurements needs support and hence justification. In the beginning the measurements at the LKO were justified by the search for environmental factors supporting therapy for tuberculosis in the mountains. This justification was obsolete a few years after World War II when modern antibiotic became available. In the 1940s G\u00f6tz justified measurements of air pollution (surface ozone) by arguing that air quality is an important \"natural resource\" of resort areas. In the 1950s the scientific purpose of stratos pheric ozone measurements at the LKO was connected to the improvement of weather forecasting. In the first part of the 1970s, reliable long- term stratospheric ozone measurements became important in the context of anthropogenic stratospheric ozone depletion. Since the middle of the 1990s, the focus lies on documentation of the recovery as expected from the 1987 Montreal Protocol. While the regulation of the Montreal Protocol saved the ozone layer from catastrophic loss recent studies suggest that climate change might significantly affect the further evolution of the ozone layer which require further studies and underlines the political relevance of continuation of high quality ozone measurements such as the longest total ozone measurements of Switzerland. Looking back it appears rather accidental that the Arosa total ozone measurements have continued until the present day, especially that they were not discontinued in the early 1960s. The history of the almost century -long LKO demonstrates that the world longest total ozone series would not exist wit h- out the efforts of dedicated scientists and their involvement in the international scientific community and networks. 1 The long- term ozone measurements also include the ozonesondes that are regularly launched from Payerne by MeteoSwiss since 1968. 2 Representative surface ozone measurements of the LKO include data of the 1950/60s as well as continuous data since 1989.

Arosa is famous in the ozone science community because the measurements, which started in 1926, led to the world's longest series of total ozone. Furthermore, the first reliable ozone profile data using the Umkehr method were per-formed at Arosa in 1932/1933 and began to be performed on a routine basis from 1956. In addition, surface ozone measurements were conducted based on long path UV absorption techniques in the 1930s, based on chemical methods in the 1950s and using modern analyzers since 1989.

Wi th per mission of s wisst opo ( S wiss digital maps, g eo.admin.ch, fr om St aeheli n et al., 2018a) . This report aims at demonstrating the key importance of the ozone measurements performed in Arosa to the international ozone research. The idea of the \"historical LKO ozone study\" goes back to 3 Lichtklimatisches Observatorium (LKO). From 1921 -1926 the Light Climatic Observatory was designated as the Light Climatic Station (Lichtklimatische Station (LKS)). 2 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) the contribution of the authors to a publication highlighting the important contributions of Swiss scien- tists to international ozone science (Staehelin et al., 2016). In this chapter of a book published to celebrate the 100 years of the Swiss Society for Meteorology (Willemse and Furger, 2016) we under- scored the many important contributions of Swiss scientists to ozone science. F. C. Sch\u00f6nbein, who discovered ozone in Basel in 1839, F. W. P G\u00f6tz and H. U. D\u00fctsch were named as \"Swiss ozone pioneers\". It is easy to put their scientific contributions in the proper context of international ozone research. However, it appeared that the historical background of the ozone measurements including their societal justification and institutional support - at least for the first decades - has not yet been well documented. As much material was available for such a study, the authors of the report (retired ozone scientists from ETH Z\u00fcrich and MeteoSwiss, encouraged by Prof. Dr Thomas Peter (IACETH, refer to footnote 12 on page 4) and Prof. Dr Bertrand Calpini (Deputy D irector of MeteoSwiss ), were motivated to continue the efforts to unveil the early periods of the LKO. Bertrand Calpini came up with a proposal to present in a book the most attractive part of this material to the public (see below). This report constitutes the basic document and summarizes the main results of the \"historical LKO ozone study\". It contains valuable information for different types of readers, ranging from ozone sc i- entists to people interested in the history of environmental science. Particular emphasis is given to the development of atmospheric ozone measurement techniques. Nonetheless, this report is not meant to be used as an atmospheric ozone textbook. Given how little has so far been published about the first years of the LKO, the report gives special attention to the early history including the life of G\u00f6tz and the developments around the observatory. In addition, it provides a comprehensive summary of all measurements performed at the LKO in Arosa, and an overview of all persons i n- volved in the instrument operation and analysis of these measurements. Furthermore, it documents the evolution of the costs related to running the LKO as well as of the means dedicated to the activ i- ties of Swiss scientists making use of the data, which can be considered as part of the added value generated thanks to the measurements. This report also serves as documentary basis for a book written by Martin L\u00e4ubli 4 entitled \"Licht, Luft, Ozon \" (to be published in summer 2019), which presents the ozone history in a way attractive for interested laypersons. The book follows the same idea as this report, demonstrating the historical motivation of scientists to start, maintain and utilize these reliable ozone measurements: the early days in Arosa, the health- related and medical aspects of ozone, the task of demonstrating the su c- cess of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, and finally the ozone- climate interactions (1987). Parts of the report have been published in the specialized scientific literature (Staehelin et al., 2018a). The paper focuses on the justification of the ozone measurements and its changes over the decades in the context of the history of international ozone research. The international ozone science community shows particular interest in some results of the study, as the community is facing increas-ing problems to continue the high- quality ozone station measurements worldwide. Indeed, continu- ous measurements as in Arosa require financial support. Staehelin et al. (2018a) reported that the MeteoSw iss Management Board decided in 2015 to explore the possibility of moving the Arosa measurements to the Physical Meteorological Observatory Davos (PMOD). Such a move would have the advantage to combine the excellent technical infrastructure and expertise available at the PMOD in Davos with a reduction of the measurement costs. Presently simultaneous total ozone measur e- 4 Martin L\u00e4ubli, Science Editor and Geographer 3 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longe st atmospheric ozone measurements 1 Introduction ments of Brewer instruments of Davos and Arosa have been analyzed and presented (St\u00fcbi et al., 2017a). Nevertheless, before stopping the measurements at Arosa, it is essential to study a currently ongoing multiannual period of overlapping measurements also with Dobson spectrophotometers at both sites (Arosa and Davos). A break in the world's longest total ozone time series would be very unfortunate. As Staehelin et al. (2018a) also point out, a relocation is particularly challenging as stratospheric recovery from ODS is expected to be slow, meaning that ozone changes will be small, and thus very high- quality measurements are required. Informatio n sources 1.2 The early history of the LKO is strongly based on the information in the LKO Archives 5 where the many letters received by G\u00f6tz are stored 6. Other important sources of information are the annual reports (AR) of the Kur - und Verkehrsverein Arosa (KVV Arosa) 7, articles in the newspaper of Arosa 8 and our own investigations, e.g. by visiting federal, cantonal and municipal archives. Among others, we had the help of Renzo Semadeni and several experts as the historian Peter Bollier 9 and the sc i- ence historian Brigit Bischof 10. The personal views, discussions and further documents provided by the children of D\u00fctsch were very helpful. The many persons providing invaluable assistance are named in the acknowledgments. Structure of the report 1.3 The first chapters of the report generally follow the different phases of the LKO. In Chapter 2 we describe the historical factors important for the est ablishment of the LKO in Arosa. In the following chapters we attempt to describe the evolution of the LKO in the context of international ozone r e- search. Chapter 3 (1921 -1954) covers the period spanning from the founding of the LKO to G\u00f6tz's death (1954). These first decades were basically determined by F. W. Paul G\u00f6tz who founded the LKO. He became one of the world leading ozone scientists and this publication intends to put the scientific merits of G\u00f6tz in an historical perspective, e.g. by describing the scientific arguments and reflections behind G\u00f6tz's expedition to Svalbard 11 in 1929, which led to the discovery of the Umkehr method providing the first reliable atmospheric ozone profile measurements. Chapter 4 (1954- 1962) describes a period during which Gertrud Perl was in charge of the measurement of the LKO and 5 At the time of publication of this report the correspondence is located at MeteoSwiss in Payerne whereas the data sheets are stored in the Federal Archives in Bern. 6 As G\u00f6tz generally did not make a copy of the letters he wrote, the number of letters written by G\u00f6tz in the LKO archive is ve ry lim- ited. If a letter is (solely) referenced by (sender) name and date, this means that the respective letter was fou nd in the LKO archives. Unfortunately, many key documents of G\u00f6tz such as contracts and others are missing. 7 The \" Kur- und Verkehrsverein Arosa\" as a cooperative; the name of the present (subsequent) organization is \"Arosa Tourismus\". It had a considerable budget, mainly sponsored by the \"tourist tax\" (Kurtaxe, i.e. a fee to be paid by foreigners/guests staying in Arosa), which was used to c over the costs of various activities, some of them currently fall ing under the responsibility of the municipality.

Chapter 5 (1962 -1985) is devoted to the period in which Hans Ulrich D\u00fctsch (professor at ETH Z\u00fcrich and head of IACETH 12) was re- sponsible for measurements at the LKO. Chapter 6 (1985- 1987) corresponds to an intermediate period following the retirement of D\u00fctsch in which the continuation of the LKO was not guaranteed for about three years before a re- orientation occurred. In 1988 the LKO became part of MeteoSwiss 13 and a joint leadership with the ETH Z\u00fcrich was established (Chapter 7, from 1988 to 2014 14). Chap- ter 8 covers the time since 2015 including remarks on the future and the observatory's anticipated m ove to Davos. In the Cha pters 6-8, we describe the international scientific evolutions and related r equirements in the first sections before presenting the Swiss contributions in the subsequent sec- tions. Chapter 9 propos es an inventory indicating the development of the LKO as a synopsis (over- view of measurements and instruments used, listing of coworkers and the scientists involved as well as the budget situation). Chapter 10 consists of the summary and outlook. The report ends with several appendices and annexes 15. Appendix 1 includes a short description (in German) of the life of Margarethe Karoline G\u00f6tz -Beversdorff, the wife of G\u00f6tz and Appendix 2 doc u- ments the naturalization of G\u00f6tz and his wife in 1946 whereas the different annexes contain the (travel) -journal (in German) written by G\u00f6tz during his expedition to Svalbard, the publication lists of G\u00f6tz, Perl and D\u00fctsch as well as the common publications 16 of ozone researchers of ETH Z\u00fcrich and MeteoSwiss and finally an inventory of the correspondence of Dorno respectively Dobson with G\u00f6tz. 12 IACETH: Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science of ETH Z\u00fcrich since 2001; earlier LAPETH: Laboratory for Atmospheric Physics of ETH Z\u00fcrich. 13 MeteoSwiss: Federal Office 14 Th is period ends in 2014 when the scientific partner at IACETH (Staehelin) retired. 15 W e distinguish between appendix (part of the main text) and annex (independent document). 16 Beginning in 1989. 5 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 2 Important factors for the founding of the Light Climatic Observatory (LKO) 2 Important factors for the founding of the Light Climatic Observatory (LKO) The world famous total ozone measurements were performed at the alpine resort area Arosa. We start this chapter with a short section on the demographic evolution of Arosa and the nearby Davos since several important connections relevant in this context exist between the two famous alpine resort villages. After this, we present a short section about the medical treatment of pulmonary tuber-culosis (TB) before modern antibiotics became available and a short introduction of the Observatory Dorno, the institution preceding the Physical Meteorological Observatory Davos (PMOD) 17, ending with a section of the life of G\u00f6tz before he founded the Light Climatic Observatory at Arosa in 1921. Davos and Arosa around the beginning of the 20th century 2.1 Davos 18 was first populated in the High Middle Age by Rhaeto- Romans 19 followed by a German speaking Walser population that were allowed to immigrate from the Canton of Valais starting in 1280. Until the middle of the 19th century Davos was a rather small village and the population lived primarily from agriculture. In 1850 the population size was 1,680 (s ee Table 1). After around 1865 Davos grew rapidly because it became a famous place for therapy in pulmonary TB (e.g. Virchow, 2004). In 1910, 26,656 patients stayed in Davos (SFI, 1997). It appears that the patients needed to pay by themselves (at least in earlier time) and therefore mostly rich patients coming from all over Europe stayed in Davos (and Arosa) to recover from pulmonary TB. Many sanatoria were built and the \"Fremdenblatt Arosa\" 20 was produced. This implies that the sanatoria were also important ec o- nomic factors for Davos (e.g. Sch\u00fcrer, 2017). The period of the World War I was an economic challenge for Davos as it became much more diff i- cult for the rich clients to travel to Davos for treatment against TB. But according to Bollier the na-tional border between Germany and Switzerland was much more permeable in World War I than in World War II and many Germans and French stayed in Switzerland (Bollier, oral communication, 2016). A particular program was set up for internees who were military persons injured in war or suffering from health problems. Even before start of World War I, a program was negotiated under the auspices of the Swiss Federal Council 21, the Red Cross and the pope in order to enable inter n- ees to recover from their health problems. In Davos, the Swiss tradition of Red Cross probably was important in this context as well as the possibility to fill the beds of hotels and sanatoria during the war. The most challenging part of this program was how to deal with those internees who recovered 17 Physikalisch- Meteorologisches Observatorium Davos (PMOD). Since 1971 the PMOD serves as World Radiation Center (WRC) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) (refer to http: www.pmodwrc.ch). 18 The information about Davos mainly originates from Wikipedia. 19 The main population of the Canton of Grisons (Graub\u00fcnden) at this time. 20 Refer to footnote 8 on page 3. 21 Bundesrat 6 Scientific Re port MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) rather soon and therefore could be sent to the front again. This required a diplomatic agreement. In this agreement Davos played an important role as center for German internees with special pr o- grams for different types of internees and multiple courses and education programs were organized. Fridericianum in particular (Sect. 2.4) was important in this program for internees, offering special courses in addition to regular courses for young adults. Table 1 indicates that population growth in Davos between 1900 and 1930 was rather moderate and the population was approximately stable thereafter. Table 1: Population size of Dav os and Arosa (from Wik ipedia Davos and Arosa). Table 1: Population size of Davos and Arosa (from Wikipedia Davos and Arosa) . Year Population Arosa 2010 11,166 2,251 Aro sa is located in the valley adjacent to Davos (see Figure 2) and was always less populated than Davos (see Table 1). Arosa was first inhabited by people coming from Davos around 1300. The set- tlers also belonged to the (German speaking) Walser population passing from Davos using the Strela pass , which was the main route to reach Arosa for many centuries. Arosa was part of the political community of Davos until 1851 and the number of inhabitants was very small (52 in 1850, see Table 1). This changed rapidly when a road was constructed in 1875 allowing direct connection from Chur to Arosa through the Plessur valley. In 1877, the first guesthouse was opened and in 1888 the first sanatorium for TB patients started - it was argued that Arosa could be an even more suitable village for this type of therapy (see below) than Davos because of its special topography (see Figure 2 and Figure 3 ) 22. Until the end of the 19th century the population growth was very fast and around 1900 a first economic maximum was reached. In that period the population grew from 61 in 1870 to 1,071 in 1900. Thereafter the growth of Arosa remained rapid, i.e. the population grew to 3,466 in 1930 23. The construction of the railway from Chur to Arosa (1912- 1914) enhanced the accessibility of Arosa. However, World War I and the economic depression in the 1930s were also difficult times for Arosa. 22 Figure 2 shows clearly that the P lessur valley makes a sharp turn at Lan gwies and ends upwind from Arosa in the plain ( \"dead end\") causing low wind speed (D\u00fctsch, 1973 and Sect. 3.5.2 ), whereas the Landwasser valley containing Davos is a rather straight valley and theref ore more directly exposed to higher wind speed. 23 https://www.gemeindearosa.ch/portrait/geschichte.html 7 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 2 Important factors for the founding of the Light Climatic Observatory (LKO) Figure 2: Map of Arosa and surroundings (Swiss digital maps, geo.admin.ch).

This happened a few years after World War II in Switzerland and surrounding countries. The state- of-the-art medical treatment of patients suffering from TB in Switzerland was the rest cure accor ding to Turban 24. Virchov (2004) includes a short summary of the medical treatment of TB until 1912. The patients were asked to move to an alpine site and they rested staying outside (on balc o- nies) during the day (mostly not directly exposed to sun) (see Figure 4). In the following we describe the achievements of two medical doctors most relevant in the context of our report. For more details on important medical doctors and other aspects of this type of therapy refer to Bergamin (2017) and Sch\u00fcrer (2017) and also compare with L\u00e4ubli (2019). Figure 4: The photography illustrates the concept of rest cure according to Turban (see t ext), which was viewed as the best therapy against TB before antibiotics became available . (Photo Davos -Klosters website, Thomas Mann & der Zauberberg).

(P hoto Davos -Klos ters websit e, T homas Mann & der Z auberberg). An important pioneer for medical treatment of pulmonary TB was Turban 25 (Bergamin, 2017). He first worked as a general practitioner in Weinheim (Germany) before hearing from the discovery of the TB bacillus by Robert Koch (1882). Thereafter he was an assistant of Koch in Berlin where he himself became sick from TB. After recovering he was asked to move to Davos to take the medical lead of a planned sanatorium. After having seen the medical treatment in Sanatoria in Davos he was shocked by the way the pulmonary TB patients behaved in the hotels in Davos - seriously ill patients were sent to w alking tours in the high mountains, going to concerts in Davos, drinking beer and dancing - 24 Heliotherapy was discovered by Dr Oscar Bernhard (1861 -1939), a medical doctor from Samedan (Engadin valley in the Grisons, Switzerland) (Hoffman, 2011). He applied heliotherapy to bone TB. Davos and Arosa were famous rest cure destinations for patients suffering from pulmonary TB. 25 Dr Karl Turban (1856- 1935) , physician in Davos . For information concerning Turban refer to Bergamin, 2017. 9 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 2 Important factors for the founding of the Light Climatic Observatory (LKO) under the eyes of medical doctors. Turban opened in 1889 the first closed large sanatorium in Davos (Sanatorium Turban) and he introduced the rest cure in closed sanatoria. He combined very strict rules for hygiene and the typical rest cure treatment, namely the patients lying outside all day. He was convinced that the high alpine climate was a very important factor for recovery. Turban had an excellent reputation and many lung TB patients from all over the world travelled to Davos for treat- ment. Amrein 26 was a very active medical doctor in Arosa - he originally suffered from TB as a young man and recovered from it in Arosa. He subsequently studied medicine but he was again infected with TB when he was working as an assistant doctor in Wald (Z\u00fcrich area). He then applied to work as assi s- tant doctor under Turban in Davos , which was not feasible at that time, but worked instead as a med- ical doctor in Davos. F inally , when the possibility was offered to him in 1900 to work directly under Turban, he was simultaneously asked to work in Arosa as a general practitioner. Faced with these two options, he ultimately decided to move to Arosa. Once there, he was more and more involved in medical treatment of TB patients and he became internationally famous, attracting patients from all over Europe to recover from TB. In order to avoid (re)infection by TB, Amrein (along with other medi-cal doctors) was able to introduce a law concerning hygiene in Arosa. Subsequently he was involved in the construction of the large sanatorium Altein in Arosa (1914- 1916) where he treated clients from all over Europe (many came from the UK), essentially following the concept used by Turban in D a- vos. He also was successful in organizing private sponsoring for destitute clients so that they could recover from TB in Arosa. But in the 1930s international clients could no longer afford to come to Arosa because of the Great Depression. The Sanatorium Altein was closed in 1931, subsequently reopened as a Sport Hotel before becoming a clinic once again. Amrein was an internationally famous medical expert in the treatment of TB. Already in 1902, two years after starting as a general practitioner in Arosa, Amrein gave a presentation at an international conference in London. In 1908, he travelled to the US, first as a delegate at an assembly of del e- gates in Philadelphia. Subsequently he gave an oral presentation at an international congress about TB in Washington and at the end of this trip he was among the delegates invited to meet President Roosevelt in the White House. In the following years Amrein participated regularly in international congresses. He also contributed to research for about 60 publications. In 1917, he published a com-prehensive book on pulmonary TB (Amrein, 1917). The book was written for practical doctors and students and is notable for Amrein's excellent overview of all important aspects relevant to pulm o- nary TB. It contains a brilliant review of the knowledge of TB stretching back to ancient times 27. The book contains detailed instructions about diagnosis, the different stages of pulmonary TB and the various types of therapy including Pneumothorax 28. After the discovery of the bacillus of TB by R. Koch in 1882 it was clear that infection was required to become ill from TB. It was also known that a large fraction of population had contact with the bacillus but never exhibited symptoms of the sic k- ness. Infection (and reinfection) needed to be avoided as best as possible. The most important pat h- way of TB bacteria was believed to be through infected sputum if the water of the sputum evapo-rated. The last chapter of the book lists in detail the attempts to avoid infection in the public area by 26 Dr Oscar Amrein (1874 -1935), physician in Arosa, Director of the Sanatorium Altein Arosa (1916- 1931); President of the Medical Doctors Association of Arosa, member of the board of the KVV Arosa. The information concerning Amrein is taken from Gartmann (2007). 27 I n ancient times pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was called \"Phtisis pulmonum\". 28 A ir was injected in the neighborhood of the infected part of the lung to allow the tissue to recover. 10 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) pointing out the key role of public hygiene and discusses the possibility of mandatory registration of persons found to be suffering from pulmonary TB. It was noted that the evolution of TB differed strongly among individuals and that for the best treatment an early di agnosis was thought to be cr u- cial. For therapy the patients needed to rest (both physically as well as mentally) and were urged to no longer live in the family and environment where they become ill. The clients should move to spe- cial hospitals ( Heilst\u00e4tte) and sanatoria. The patients with fever needed to stay in bed. Consequently, the careful observation of fever was viewed as a very important indicator of the evolution of TB. The rest, implying to stay all the days on balconies in outside air, was regarded as the most successful therapy. Amrein believed that an alpine area provided the best environment for recovery from TB - he pr o- posed that the only reason not to follow this type of therapy was if the general health condition of the patient was too bad to travel to a high alpine site. He was aware that some medical doctors did not agree with the important role of climate for recovery from TB and supported the idea of a large inter-national study. This was proposed but not feasible during World War I. Being c onvinced that the alpine climate was superior to others for recovery from pulmonary TB, he listed the following env i- ronmental factors as potentially relevant: low pressure and dryness of air, absence of large temper a- ture differences, weak winds, absence of air pollution (fog, dust and smoke), presence of ozone and an abundance of natural light and sunshine. Two textbooks for medical students that were published around 1940 (Assmann et al, 1939 and von Domarus, 1941 29) detail the medical view of pulmonary TB and its medical treatment approximately a decade before modern antibiotics were available. The description of the medical knowledge history is very similar to that written by Amrein. Assmann et al. (1939) state that mortality from TB as described by stati stics of the German Empire was large in 1885 but followed a strong downward trend until 1930. The number of cases per 10,000 dropped from 25 per year in 1895 to approximately 8 in 1930 with a strong intermittent increase again during World War I. The gener al decrease was probably caused by increasing public awareness of the bacillus being transferred by sputum, confirming that proper public hygiene was important. The intermittent increase during World War I was attributed by Assmann to bad nutrition among t he population. In the 1930s, reliable diagnostics were available by bacteriological assay as well as by using X -ray. The textbooks were state- of-the-art until World War II and highlight the importance of nutrition; other - wise there is no obvious difference to Amrein's book , which was published in 1917 30. It appears that the rest therapy was considered to be most effective in supporting the body's recovery from lung TB (prior to availability of antibiotics). However, the beneficial effect of high altitudes f or therapy of TB was never demonstrated by scientific studies (Sch\u00fcrer, 2017). Suffering from TB and the death of young people was the subject of several masterpieces 31. In the famous book the \"Magic Mountain\" 32 by Thomas Mann, the male hero visits Davos where he gets infected by pulmonary TB. According to Virchow (2004), Thomas Mann came to Davos for four 29 The textbook of Assmann et al. ( 1939 ) contains more details than von Domarus (1941) but essentially the same information. 30 Including reinfection, relaxation, hygienic conditions and alpine environment. 31 For example, the opera \" La Boh\u00e8me \" of Giacomo Puccini (1896) and the book \" Drei Kameraden \" of Erich Maria Remarque (fi rst published in 1937). 32 The \"Magic Mountain\" ( Der Zauberberg ) is a novel by the German writer Thomas Mann, first published in German in November 1924. 11 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atm ospheric ozone measurements 2 Important factors for the founding of the Light Climatic Observatory (LKO) weeks in May/June 1912 to visit his wife who was staying there to recover from pulmonary TB 33. The reactions of Davos' medical doctors to Mann's book were mostly negative when it was published more than 12 years after his visit to Davos as it contained, in their view, heavy criticism regarding the treatment of TB patients. One of the criticisms was Mann's descriptions of personal characteristics of doctors and other sanatoria staff in a way that they could be recognized, but the treatment of pulm o- nary TB patients was only part of the book's main history. Nevertheless, the occasional indecent behavior of pulmonary TB clients in closed sanatoria was subject to criticism, as the concept of the rest cure consisted of staying quiet on balconies for many weeks without many possibilities of di s- traction, as mentioned by several experts (Virchow, 2004), raising the question of whether the ps y- chological wellbeing of TB patients was adequate. In contrast to the majority of the doctors of Davos, Amrein (1928) published in the medical literature in May 1928 a statement that TB patients as de-scribed by Mann indeed existed, stating that it is the duty of the medical doctors to protect the pa-tients against the negative influence of the \"Magic Mountain\" environment. We might speculate that the distinctly different public statement of Amrein might be viewed as an indicator of possible prob-lems in the medical communities of Davos and Arosa as they were competing for TB clients. This might have played some role in the collaboration between Davos and Arosa in medical and climat o- logical research (Sect. 3.2). Observatory Dorno and institute for tuberculosis research 2.3 Though the rest cure was well established in TB therapy, direct evidence for its success was lacking and some debates took place among medical doctors questioning the benefit of high alpine locations (Pischinger, 1927). As early as 1905, Turban ( Sect. 2.2) made a proposal to establish an institute in Davos to study the effectiveness of this type of lung therapy (SFI, 1997). But because of different opinions and a lack of consensus among the medical doctors such an institute was finally established only in 1922 under the leadership of Erhard Branger 34, Mayor of Davos. On 22 March 1922, a dec i- sion was taken at the municipalit y assembly to establish a foundation for supporting a new institute for high altitude physiology and tuberculosis research 35 (SFI) in Davos. The financial resources f or the foundation were provided from different sponsors and it was decided that all foreigners living in Davos that needed to register had to pay a small tax (0.05 CHF) per night to support the institute (for more details refer to SFI, 1997). For the proper study of the effectiveness of rest cure therapy at alpine sites, knowledge about the environmental conditions of an alpine area was undoubtedly i m- portant. Dorno 36 founded in 1907 an observatory in Davos using his own resources, aiming to study the env i- ronmental factors important for the recovery from TB at alpine sites (SFI, 1997). Dorno first financed his observatory using his own means. He originated from a rich family from K\u00f6nigsberg (Germany). However, he lost most of his financial resources during World War I and the subsequent period of inflation. The community assembly of Davos decided on 18 February 1923 to support the Observato- 33 Though the diagnosis was wrong according to Virchow (2004). 34 Erhard Branger (1881 -1958), PhD, May or of ), (Swiss Research Institute for High Altitude Climate and Medicine). 36 Carl Dorno (1865 -1942), PhD, professor, originally came to Davos in 1904 because his daughter suffered from TB. Although she passed away a few years after arriving in Davos, Dorno stayed at Davos until he died in 1942. 12 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Instit ute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) ry Dorno . When Dorno retired as director in 1926, the observatory was integrated and financed as an independent department of the SFI 37. After full retirement in 1928, Dorno continued to contribute to research (for more details refer to SFI, 1997). Though the community of Davos provided additional financial resources to support the part of the Observatory Dorno, the problems of SFI with funding shortages remained, particularly for medical research (SFI, 1997). Dorno's observatory was the nu- cleus of the PMOD. G\u00f6tz's life before the founding of the LKO 2.4 Friedrich Wilhelm Paul G\u00f6tz 38 was a German scientist who was working with Dorno in Davos in 1919- 1920 (see Table 2) before founding the LKO in Arosa (Sect. 3.1). Regarding the life of G\u00f6tz prior to the founding of the LKO the following important obituaries written by Trenkel 39 (1954), Waldmeier 40 (1955), D\u00fctsch 41 (1954a, 1954b, 1954c and 1955) and a publication of D\u00fctsch (1992) are available (see Figure 5 ). A CV written by G\u00f6tz exists but is incomplete. Since none of these doc- ument s describe this period of G\u00f6tz's life comprehensively, we complement ed the published infor- mation with our own research in various public and private archives. G\u00f6tz grew up in G\u00f6ppingen, a village near Stuttgart in Germany (see Figure 5), where his father Paul was running a hardware store. According to Trenkel (1954) his father expected him to continue his business, but G\u00f6tz decided to study astrophysics. Waldmeier (1955) writes that G\u00f6tz started his studies in physics and mathematics in 1910 in Heilbronn and that he originally intended to achieve a high- school teaching 42 degree for mathematics and physics. However, G\u00f6tz had already started his scientific education in astronomy in 1912, receiving a \"good education\" in photometry in T\u00fcbingen under Rosenberg 43 and \"excellent training\" under Wolf 44 in Heidelberg in astronomical photography. This work led to his PhD dissertation titled \" Photographische Photometrie der Mondoberfl\u00e4c he\" 45, which was accepted in 1919. In agreement with Trenkel we were able to document that G\u00f6tz first stayed in Davos for health rea-sons (see Table 2). In the \"release book\" 46 of the patients leaving the German Sanatorium 47 the 37 The name of the medical department (Tuberculosis Research Institute) was changed in 1988 to Swiss Institute of Allergy and As th- ma Research (SIAF) (Schweizerisches Institut f\u00fcr Allergie- und Asthmaforschung). 38 Note that F.W. Paul G\u00f6tz is obviously not the same person as Paul G\u00f6tz (1883 -1962) who, by pure coincidence, was almost of the same age and (also) graduated in astronomy under M. Wolf at the university of Heidelberg in 1907 (refer to Wikipedia Paul G\u00f6t z astro n- omer) as confirmed by a letter found in the LKO archives. 39 Heinrich Trenkel, PhD, was a medical doctor at Arosa and a personal friend of G\u00f6tz. 40 Max Waldmeier (1912- 2000), PhD, P rofessor for Astronomy at ETH Z\u00fcrich (1945 -1979) and University Z\u00fcrich (19 45-1982), Director of the Swiss National Observatory (Semper Observatory) (1945- 1979) (Christian Bartsch, Swiss Lexicon). 41 Hans Ulrich D\u00fctsch refer to Section 5.1. 42 \" Gymnasium \" is often translated in English as \"high school \".

The German Sanatorium in Davos was famous for therapy in pulmonary TB and therefore we believe that G\u00f6tz indeed suffered from this widespread seri ous il l- ness 49. The information of the \"release book\" also contains the periods of his stays; the first lasted from 27 March to 10 August 1914, the second from 27 October 1914 to 26 May 1915. At the end of the curative stays G\u00f6tz was declared fit for work. It is interesting to note that G\u00f6tz travelled to Davos for the first time before World War I started 50.

From the inquir y of Bollier we know that G\u00f6tz was a teacher at the Fridericianum in Davos. From the Annual Report of Fridericianum 1915/16 48 We do not question the identity of G\u00f6tz as he is listed as \"cand. math.\" originating from W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany. 49 Note that patients of the German Sanatorium did not need to register in the municipality. 50 28 July 1914. 51 \"Fridericianum zu Davos was a military approved German Foreign school\".

Original designation: Milit\u00e4rdienst.\" 14 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) (p.10- 11) 52 we learn that teacher trainee Paul G\u00f6tz from G\u00f6ppingen, formerly assistant of the obser- vatory of K\u00f6nigstuhl near Heidelberg, replaced another teacher at the end of October 1915 who joined the army. G\u00f6tz took the responsibility of giving lectures in chemistry and physics (first grade) as well as lectures in mathematics and natural sciences for the senior grade 53. In the Annual Report of 1916/17, it is noted (p. 22- 23) that G\u00f6tz resigned from his employment at the end of October 1916. G\u00f6tz was teaching again, presumably from July 1918 until 15 February 1919 (see Table 2). This information is confirmed by documents found at the municipal administration of Davos 54 (see Table 2). However, apparently G\u00f6tz started to teach in 1916 about six months before he was registered in the municipality. His health had obviously recovered sufficiently to teach several classes in mathe-matics and physics at the Fridericianum , which is believed to be a rather challenging job 55. A publ i- cation of G\u00f6tz in a journal for teachers 56 (G\u00f6tz, 1922) seems to be related to his engagement as a teacher at the Fridericianum. G\u00f6tz stayed altogether a little more than half of the time from 1914 to 1919 intermittently in Davos. We do not know where he spent the rest of the time. G\u00f6tz writes in a letter to Amrein on 19 January 1926 (Sect. 3.2) that his life's plans were disturbed 57 by World War I, and he writes that he needed to serve in military ancillary service. However, there is no evidence that G\u00f6tz did serve among the combat troops of the German army. We might speculate that he was not very patriotic as he avoided using the first given names Friedrich Wilhelm, the first names of the German Emperors given by his parents but preferred to be called Paul (the third given name). In the scientific literature he always appears as F. W. Paul G\u00f6tz. It seems most plausible that G\u00f6tz was working at least partially on his PhD thesis in Germany in the meantime when he was not present in Switzerland, as otherwise he most probably would not have been able to finish his PhD within one year after the war ended. G\u00f6tz also had a permit to stay in Davos for the period 29 September 1919 - 21 October 1924 (see Table 2). For this period G\u00f6tz is not listed as a teacher in Fridericianum. Apparently G\u00f6tz was wor k- ing some time as assistant at the Observatory Dorno in 1919- 1920 before he went to Arosa (Casti, 1971 and D\u00fctsch, 1973; Figure 5) 58. In this collaboration G\u00f6tz (G\u00f6tz, 1925, see also Sect. 9.1.2.a) studied the spectrograms of the UV spectrum recorder of Davos with the microphotometer of the astronomical observatory of T\u00fcbingen 59 using light detection by photographic plates. But he was not satisfied with the results of this study 60, documenting differing views of Dorno and G\u00f6tz regarding instrumental requirements and design. G\u00f6tz left Davos on April 1920 (see Table 2) four years before the permit ended and one and a half year before the founding of the LKO (Sect. 3.1) in Arosa. 52 The school year started in August and ended in June. 53 Of one department ( Realabteilung der Oberprima) . 54 Kindly provided by Susanne Wernli, Municipality of Davos. 55 G\u00f6tz was never an internee as shown by Wernli in the documentation of the municipality of Davos. 56 Schweizerische Lehrerzeitung 57 Letter G\u00f6tz, 19 January 1926.

The KVV Arosa accepted the request of the Medical Doctors Association at the meeting of the Gen- eral Assembly on 20 August Following the proposal of Jacobi 66, G\u00f6tz was mandated by the KVV Arosa as scientist to found and run the LKO. According to Danuser (1998a), Jacobi argued that the financial burden would be rather small as G\u00f6tz asked only for a modest salary and Sanatorium Arosa (see Figure 1) would offer space for these measurements and for housing. A letter written by the lawyer Bernet 67 on 25 August 1921 on behalf the KVV Arosa (see Figure 6) shows that G\u00f6tz was invited to start radiative climatic studies. In this letter he was asked to clarify the working program in more detail and some other points before the contract was signed. It was also suggested that G\u00f6tz start his work by 1 November 1921. G\u00f6tz obv i- ously accepted this invitation and began working at Arosa 68. In December 1921 and January 1922, he wrote three articles in the newspaper of Arosa 69 describing the concept and planned measur e- ments in a form readily understood by educated laymen. We do not know the details of the contract between G\u00f6tz and the funding institution. Ostensibly G\u00f6tz did not obtain a long- term contract 70. The measurements of the LKO were performed on the roof of the Sanatorium Arosa 71 (see Figure 7 and Figure 8 ). 64 The climatological meteorological observations by the national weather service (MeteoSwiss) in Arosa go back President of the KVV Arosa from the the early 1930s until 1949. 66 Dr Ernst Jacobi, physician, President of the Medical Doctors Association of Arosa and Director of Sanatorium A rosa (one of the oldest and important sanatoria of Arosa). 67 Hermann Bernet (1880 -1930), lawyer, member of the parli ament of the Canton of Grisons, President of the KVV Arosa. 68 G\u00f6tz's name is listed as Sanatorium Arosa in the \"Fremdenblatt Arosa\" in 1922. 69 Refer to footnote 8 on page 3. 70 This is also suggested from some remarks in the correspondence Dorno -G\u00f6tz (Dorno, 27 and 30 December 1922). 71 First called Sanatorium Berghilf.

With its support of G\u00f6tz's idea, Arosa was the first resort village to support research in climatology. It is particularly notable that it predated Davos, a fact which was stressed by G\u00f6tz several times. Dor-no's observatory was older but a private undertaking. This historical evolution is confirmed by three letters from M\u00f6rikofer 72 and G\u00f6tz of January 1935 in which G\u00f6tz clarifies that it was his idea and initiative to contact the medical doctors of Arosa to s upport \"light climatic studies\". G\u00f6tz informed Dorno only when the negotiations with the medical doctors were more or less settled 73.

Initial years and relationship between G\u00f6tz and Dorno (PMOD) 3.2 In the first years (1921- 1924) G\u00f6tz measured ultraviolet (UV -B) radiation using a photoelectric cell with a cadmium cathode as detector (Cd -cell) 74. This instrument was property of the Observatory Dorno. G\u00f6tz obtained training from Dorno in 1921 to use the instrument before starting measur e- ments in Arosa. In 1924 G\u00f6tz returned the Cd- cell (and other borrowed instruments) to the Observ a- tory Dorno. Many letters from Dorno to G\u00f6tz stored at the LKO Archives show that in the first years they had common measurements pr ojects and were looking positively forward to a closer collaboration be- tween Davos and Arosa (see Figure 9 and Figure 10). Several letters suggest that Dorno, who was 26 years older than G\u00f6tz, viewed himself as a mentor of G\u00f6tz. Quite a few remarks of Dorno were related to G\u00f6tz's well -being including recommendations to be careful with his health 75. 74 For a comprehensive description refer to Levi ( 1932 ). 75 Though G\u00f6tz had completed his treatment in the German Sanatorium ( Deutsche Heilst\u00e4tte ) of Davos more th an 5 years earlier. 20 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) Figure 9: Letter from Dorno to G\u00f6tz of 14 September 1923 76.

The correspondence between Dorno and G\u00f6tz also shows that they were aware of the touristic a s- pects and that their studies would convincingly contribute to the promotion of Davos resp. Arosa and the Grisons region. Referring to the advertisement poster painted (see Figure 11) by Giacometti 77, Dorno writes to G\u00f6tz: \"There is no doubt that our investigations have brought Giacometti to paint the poster with the red umbrella. Please, if you have the opportunity, do not forget to mention that it is our merit to have raised the attention of a broad community on this God- given gift of grace that the 77 August Giacometti (1877- 1947), a famous painter of the Grisons. 22 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) sunshine represents for the Grisons, and that, through this poster, the whole country is benefitting indirectly from them [i.e. our investigations]\" 78.

Despite everything, the relationship between G\u00f6tz and Dorno was becoming gradually more and more difficult as the paternalistic behavior of Dorno seems to have increasingly irked G\u00f6tz. We also do not know whether the personal relationship was affected by the unclarified situation be- tween their institutes. Dorno wrote to G\u00f6tz in several letters that the close cooperation between the 78 Letter Dorno, 22 March 1924. Translated by 23 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The stor y of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 3 1921 -1954: Period of F. W. Paul G\u00f6tz LKO Arosa and the Observatory Dorno had very high priority for him. Ostensibly Dorno was suppor t- ing the idea of a partnership based on the principle of \"equal duties, equal rights\". However, letters suggest that Davos (Dorno) did not agree with a proposal of Arosa (KVV Arosa, Medical doctors) in terms of \"equal duties\", possibly because Arosa was not ready to provide the expected financial sup-port. On the other hand, it seems evident that the medical doctors of Arosa also wanted to increase visibility of the work supported by Arosa (see below). A letter from 13 November 1924 written by G\u00f6tz to Dorno and the reply of Dorno (15 November 1924) illustrate serious problems in their relationship mixing personal and professional aspects. G\u00f6tz had obviously made a presentation at the Swiss Society of Natural Sciences 79 in Lucerne wit hout informing Dorno, who was upset about the content of the talk. In the letter of 13 November 1924, G\u00f6tz apologized for his presentation not being based on a written manuscript 80. He agreed that c o- ordination of research with Davos would be important, but he clarifies that he did not feel comfortable regarding his role vs. the Observatory Dorno and the medical doctors at Arosa: \"it is not fair to level accusations at me when I refer to what I committed myself to, at Arosa\" 81 (Sect. 3.1). Finally, he clearly defended himself against the accusation of dishonorable behavior 82 made by Dorno in an earlier phone call. The letter from Dorno of 15 November 1924 starts with criticism that G\u00f6tz present-ed measurements of shortwave solar radiation with the Cd- cell instrument as being reliable for geo- physical studies (i.e. for stratospheric ozone) and Dorno claims that he did not use the instrument properly. It is hardly feasible for us today to judge whether G\u00f6tz used the instrument in a proper way; nevertheless, these measurements were subsequently published and discussed in the reviewed literature (G\u00f6tz, 1925 and 1926a). Dorno argued that he has much more experience with this instr u- ment and claimed that other scientists using such an instrument did not view his remarks for the purposes of scientific rigor as criticism but more as an aid for publishing the results. Dorno repeated several times that G\u00f6tz did not point out in a proper way all the merits of the Observatory Dorno, e.g. that he used an instrument , which was property of the Observatory Dorno and that he obtained trai n- ing in the instrument at his institute. The contention between G\u00f6tz and Dorno culminated in January 1926 when a debate took place be- tween the medical doctors of Arosa and Davos. Obviously , the medical doctors of Arosa under the leadership of Amrein, successor of Jacobi as president of the Medical Doctors Association of Arosa in 1925, sent a letter on 8 January to the medical doctors of Davos with the proposition to merge the activities of the LKO and the Observatory Dorno and to establish a new joint observatory in Arosa. This letter could not be found in the LKO Archives but is referred to in other documents. This proposal is possibly related to the fact that Dorno was near retirement and the future of the O b- servatory Dorno at that time was considered by the medical doctors of Arosa to be still open. There was an immediate and vigorous response from the medical doctors of Davos, signed by its president Georg Michel, sent to Amrein on 12 January 1926. From the phrasing of this letter it is likely that it was drafted or written by Dorno. The reply of the doctors of Davos started with the clarification that the Observatory Dorno was much more than a Light Climatic Station and that the light climatic obser- 79 Schweizerische Naturforschende Gesellschaft. 80 Which could have been sent to Dorno prior to the presentation. 81 Letter G\u00f6tz, 13 November 1924. Translat ed by the Arosa verpflichtet authors. Original text: unehrenhaftes Verhalten\". 24 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atm ospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) vations counted only for a small part of the scientific activities of the observatory. It was also asserted that all light climatic studies had been started by the Observatory established by Dorno. The letter contains a short history of the Observatory and states that a contract already existed for the future (Sect. 2.3). The letter then claims that the Light Climatic Station in Arosa only existed because of the engagement of Dorno, not only because G\u00f6tz could use instruments (Cd -cell) from Davos and ob- tained extended instructions to use these instruments. The letter goes as far as to claim that Dorno originally only agreed with the measurements at Arosa in order to help G\u00f6tz get an opportunity to stay in the alpine environment to recover from his health problems and that, in Dorno's view, thes e health concerns had higher priority than any other arguments, including scientific arguments. Fur-thermore, the fact that G\u00f6tz's results were yet to be published was criticized. In the end, the options of moving the light climatic activities or the entire Observatory Dorno to Arosa were rejected. It was made clear that the activities of Davos were internationally acclaimed and that the proposed exten-sion of the institute's name to loseforschu ng in Davos und Arosa\" would be not acceptable as the institute was located in Davos and Arosa's contribution was merely the Light Climatic Station. The letter concludes with the remark that an earlier proposal of a cooperation proposed by the Davos' doctors to those of Arosa based on \"equal rights and equal duties\" had obviously not been accepted by the Arosa's partners 83. Apparently, G\u00f6tz was not involved prior nor informed about the letter sent by Amrein on 8 January 1926 because he stayed in G\u00f6ppingen due to urgent family reasons, possibly because of his father's serious health problems (Sect. 3.3). Amrein asked G\u00f6tz for comments on the reply from Davos doc- tors. In the letter sent to Amrein on 19 January 1926, G\u00f6tz was upset and expressed that the letter from 12 January 1926 by Davos' medical doctors to Amrein described his role in a false and very unfair way. For example, he clarified that it was his own idea to start measurements at Arosa (Sect. 3.1, last para.), and that the training he obtained at the PMOD was funded by the KVV Arosa etc. In summary, it seems quite striking that the relation between the doctors of Arosa and Davos was obviously difficult 84. These debates appear not only to reflect competition between the two medical societies but also between the resort areas Davos and Arosa (Sect. 2.1). Dorno also disagreed with G\u00f6tz in scientific analysis (Sect. 2.4, last para.). G\u00f6tz's publications (G\u00f6tz, 1925 and G\u00f6tz, 1926a and 1926b) cover the analysis of the measurements with the Cd- cell. In his analysis G\u00f6tz found an indication of the seasonal variation in total ozone, with a maximum in spring and a minimum in the fall. This publication was earlier than the more famous paper from Dobson and Harrison published 1926. In 1927, Dorno criticized G\u00f6tz's publication concerning the Cd- cell results in the open literature (Dorno, 1927a 85). The scientific arguments were discussed more thoroughly by Levi, a scientific employee from the PMOD (Levi, 1932). 83 Unfortunately , all our efforts to find more documents on the dispute between the medical societies of Davos and Arosa were unsu c- cessful ( including the Documentation Library (Dokumentationsbibliothek ) of Davos and the Cantonal Archives of the Grisons ( Staatsa r- chiv Graub\u00fcnden ). 84 One might argue that in case of good relations, Amrein might have first discussed orally with his colleague from Davos to find an appropriate solution for cooperation in atmospheric studies before writing a letter. 85 T he paper also includes a reply from G\u00f6tz . 25 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ET H Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 3 1921 -1954: Period of F. W. Paul G\u00f6tz After 1926, private correspondence between G\u00f6tz and Dorno seems to have been reduced to cards thanking for reprints. Despite that, there was obviously scientific exchange between M\u00f6rikofer 86 and G\u00f6tz. In the LKO Archives we found a letter dated 13 December 1932 from M\u00f6rikofer starting with a sentence that he contributed to an annex to the protocol of the Radiation conference as suggested by G\u00f6tz. In the following paragraph of this letter M\u00f6rikofer informs G\u00f6tz that Levi (see above) was leaving the PMOD without having a new job. Furthermore, M\u00f6rikofer emphasizes that this should be viewed as information (and not as tentative to pressure him) in case it might be useful for him. It is not clear whether this information was an invitation for G\u00f6tz to apply for an open position in the PMOD, possibly with the implication for G\u00f6tz to move from Arosa to Davos, or a mere suggestion to consider employment of Levi at the LKO 87. Both options are informative as they express that G\u00f6tz, as seen on many other occasions, was not thoroughly happy with the situation at the LKO 88. Maron 89 wrote in his book (Maron, 1960, 43ff.) that attempts to coordinate research work with Davos started after founding of the LKO and were continued after death of Dorno but failed (Sect. 3.6.4) because of lack of interest from Davos 90. Construction of Villa Firnelicht, Tschuggen and personal matters 3.3 3.3.1 Villa Firnelicht Year 1926 was important in G\u00f6tz's career. In early 1926, the confrontation between G\u00f6tz and Dorno reached a peak (Sect. 3.2) and G\u00f6tz continued his research on his own. In the same year G\u00f6tz star t- ed a close collaboration with Dobson 91 (Sect. 3.7) and had the opportunity to use in Arosa a F\u00e9ry type spectrograph constructed by Dobson (see Figure 16 and Sect. 9.1.2). In the same year, G\u00f6tz's father died and we find the personal dedication to his father 92 in the book \"Das Strahlungsklima von Arosa\" (G\u00f6tz, 1926b). Another important step in 1926 was the completion of the construction of his own house (Villa Firnel-icht, see Figure 12), which is located close to the Sanatorium Arosa (see Figure 1). We obtained information from the administration of the Arosa municipality that G\u00f6tz bought the land of Villa Firne-licht on 20 November 1924 from the civic community 93 of Chur. The \"transfer of the observatory into its own premises occurred\" when the construction of the house was finished in early 1926 94. 86 Refer to footnote 72 on 18. 87 Although the financial situation of LKO under G\u00f6tz was difficult. 88 For further contacts of G\u00f6tz with M\u00f6rikofer refer to Section 3.6.4. 89 Refer to footnote 65 on page 16. 90 Maron, 1960.

Figure 13: C onstruc tion plans admi nistration of the c ommunit y of Aros a, see t ext). 28 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The house was designed by Ferdinand Zai, a famous architect from Arosa who had constructed several houses in the area (Just et al., 2007). The building was constructed along the slope of the hill (see Figure 1) and had three floors (see Figure 13 for the plans submitted by G\u00f6tz to the municipality of Arosa). On the roof and on the balcony of the third floor 95, instruments were installed to perform atmospheric observations. All three floors contained a kitchen, bedrooms, and toilets. Villa Firnelicht was rather large as a home for just two people. G\u00f6tz obviously invited many colleagues to stay at Villa Firnelicht (see Table 3 in Sect. 3.4). It was also an opportunity for him to generate additional income. Obviously , rooms or apartments at Villa Firnelicht were also (occasionally) rented to other persons as deduced from the newspaper of Arosa 96 (Sect. 3.10). 3.3.2 Hut at Tschuggen At the beginning of 1930, G\u00f6tz was looking for an observation place outside of the village of Arosa suitable for night time observations, allowing interference in the signal from disturbing light sources in night time observation to be overcome 97. His choice fell on a hill at the top of Tschuggen 98, a site free from light pollution. On 28 February 1933, he addressed a request to the civic community of Chur , which was the owner of the land. On 3 April 1933, the citizen's council of the city of Chur agreed, in principle, to make a land parcel on the mountain available, initially on loan for 30 years. The choice of the concrete location and the entry in the cadastral register were settled the following year. In a letter from 16 July 1934, the KVV Arosa confirmed that the credit for the construction of a measuring station on this lot was fully granted. The date when the new hut became operational is not exactly known, but in the LKO activity survey 1931- 34, published by G\u00f6tz in the annals of the Swiss Society of Natural Sciences 99 (G\u00f6tz, 1934), a photograph (taken on 2 November 1934) of the newly constructed hut is reproduced (see Figure 14). In the following decades G\u00f6tz spent many nights at Tschuggen, alone or with an assistant (e.g. D\u00fctsch, see Section 5.1), to carry out observations, e.g. of aurora borealis and of air glow phenom e- na. The hut served for all kinds of additional measurements during the different periods of the LKO (Sect. 9.1.3). The site is still used by the LKO in current times.

In 1938, an astrophysical observatory of ETH Z\u00fcrich was constructed under Waldmeier 100 close to the Tschuggen hut. The observatory 101 served as a platform for the famous studies on the eleven- year solar sunspot number by Waldmeier. 3.3.3 Personal 27 December 1932 G\u00f6tz married Margarete Karoline Beverstorff 102. She had been registered in Arosa since 7 January 1923. Trenkel (1954) noted that Margarete Beverstorff moved to Villa Firnel- icht together with G\u00f6tz in 1926. According to wife of Kurt Aeschbacher 103, Mar- garete G\u00f6tz admired her husband and strongly supported his work. She assisted G\u00f6tz to perform meteorological measurements and observations. Seemingly she took care of the many scientific guests that visited Arosa to perform measurements and for scientific exchange (see Table 3 in Sect. 3.4). Appendix 1: contains a short description (in German) about the life of M. G\u00f6tz -Beverstorff. G\u00f6tz and his wife obtained Swiss citizenship on 28 May 1946 ( Appendix 2). The first attempt of natu- ralization failed because the representatives of the Canton of Grisons were suspicious about whether G\u00f6tz was collaborating with the Nazi regime as G\u00f6tz and his wife traveled several times to Germany during World War II. In the second and successful attempt G\u00f6tz and his wife had justified every trip to Germany and Austria during Wor ld War II. Appendix 2 shows that G\u00f6tz and his wife actively suppor t- ed several persons threatened by the Nazis, which is also shown by his commitment to Hedwig Kohn (Sect. 3.6.2). Renzo Semadeni, who was living mostly in Arosa, also thinks that G\u00f6tz did not count 100 Refer to footnote 40 on page 12. 101 The observatory served until 2002 (refer to Section 7.3). 102 She was born on 20 February 1903 and was therefore 12 years younger than G\u00f6tz. 103 Kurt Aeschbacher, local station manager of the LKO (1964 -2001), retired in 2001 ( for more details refer to Section 9.2.1.b) . 30 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) among the Germans living in Arosa during World War II with sympathies for the Nazi Regime as testified by Ladenburg 104 in a letter of June 1946 105. The LKO as research institute under G\u00f6tz 3.4 The LKO under G\u00f6tz can be viewed as a small research company (basically a one- man company) with similarities to modern small private research consulting companies 106. G\u00f6tz's very successful scientific career (Sect. 3.10) was based on the following factors: G\u00f6tz obtained continuous but modest support, first solely from the KVV Arosa, later also from the Railway Company Chur -Arosa (Sect. 3.6.1) and other institutions (Sect. 9.3.1) in order to assure the LKO's core program of measurements 107. G\u00f6tz obviously performed most of the observations himself with UV spectrophotometers (on loan from Dobson) and others (Sect. 9.1.2). The income was probably sufficient to finance his and his wife's basic living costs 108. It seems that he already had part time assistants in the first years 109. G\u00f6tz made a large investment in constructing Villa Firnelicht (Sec t. 3.3) enabling him to ask leading scientists to perform (together with him) cutting- edge research by observations per- formed at Villa Firnelicht. The most outstanding example is the campaign of Umkehr meas-urements , which were performed in Arosa in 1932- 1933 (Sect. 3.8.5; for other examples r e- fer to Section 9.1.3). In addition, G\u00f6tz invited colleagues to take short sabbaticals in Villa Firnelicht (see Table 3 ). LKO's budget was always tight, making it very difficult to buy state- of-the art instruments. This made it necessary for him to look for joint projects with other scientist or institutions. G\u00f6tz began his studies in partnership with Dorno with an instrument that was property of the Observatory Dorno (Sect. 3.2). He then started a collaboration with Dobson, and this gave him the opportunity to use three types of spectrophotometers constructed by Dobson (Sect. 3.7) 110. He needed to apply for external grants. The first example is the grant of the German R e- search Foundation 111 to finance his expedition to Svalbard in 1929 (Sect. 3.8). Others are mentioned in Section 9.3.2. 104 Rudolf Ladenburg (1882 -1952) , PhD, a well-know n German physicis t, accepted the appointment as professor at Princeton Univers ity (USA) in 1932 because his family was Jewish . 105 In a letter (copy) of 7 June 1946 signed by Ladenburg as a Research Professor of Princeton University we read: \"Thi s is to testify that I have known Professor Doctor F. W. Paul G\u00f6tz very well for many years. I know that he had never any connection with the German Nazis, nor any inclination for them. As a matter of fact, he refused a call as Professor of the University of Frankfurt A/M, Germany, on account of his disapproval of the Nazi government.\" This letter was written in order to facilitate the natu ralization of G\u00f6tz and his wife, but in fact they obtained Swiss citizenship around 10 days prior to this letter. 106 In the sense that research scientists earn their income not as employees of a governmental laboratory nor a university but with their own company, also being responsible for infrastructure, e.g. a house in the case of G\u00f6tz. 107 Measurements of total ozone and solar radiation (Sect. 9.1.3.a) complementing the observations of the climatological station of MeteoSwiss (Sect. 9.1.1.a) . 108 Considering that they did not need to pay for housing. 109 Although little is known about the assistants working at the LKO in the 1920s and 1930s (Sect. 9.2.1.a) . 110 Besides these instruments the Arosa ultraviolet spectrograph was constructed with resources of the KVV Arosa on a design supe r- Wissenschaft (NDW). 31 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climati c Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 3 1921 -1954: Period of F.

He participated in the important i n- ternational Ozone Conferences (see Table 5). A letter in the LKO Archives (G\u00f6tz to Bernet, 27 D e- cember 1928) shows that Arosa had been foreseen as venue of the first ozone conference. However, 33 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 3 1921 -1954: Period of F. W. Paul G\u00f6tz as the necessary guarantees by the authorities of Arosa were delayed, Paris was chosen as meeting place 116. The conference in Tharandt (Germany) took place in 1944 (see Table 5 ) and was supported by the German Meteorological Service 117; the results were published after the World War II in reports from the German Weather Service in the US Zone (Weickmann, 1949). G\u00f6tz is listed as a member of the International Radiation Commission of IMO 118 (1932 -1936) and of IAMAS (1948- 51) (Internat. Rad. Com., 2008). G\u00f6tz was a member of the Committee on Ozone es- tablished in September 1933 within the Radiation Commission of IAMAS as requested by Charles Fabry 119 and recommended by the Fourth Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geo- physics (IUGG) 120 at Stockholm in 1930 (Bojkov, 2012). He also was a member of the International Ozone Commission ( IO3C) 121 from 1948 until 1954. In the AR 1941 (KVVA, 1921- 1977) we learn that G\u00f6tz was elected as member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina 122 honoring his excellent r e- search. In AR 1949, it is indicated that G\u00f6tz was a member of the following international commi s- sions: Commission for Solar -Terrestrial Relations, Radiation Commission, Northern Light Commi s- sion, Ozone Commission and UNESCO Commission for High Alpine Research Institutes.

He also wrote articles in the local newspaper 123 and produced occasional articles in other newspapers. 116 Later on, G\u00f6tz undertook a second attempt and wanted to organiz e the ozone conference of 1936 in Arosa, obviously without suc- cessful realization (refer to Section 3.9.1). 117 Deutscher Reichswetterdienst. 118 International Meteorological Organization (1853 -1950), the predecessor to the World Meterological Organization (WMO). 119 Charles Fabry (1867- 1945), PhD, physicist, Professor of General Physics at Sorbonne, Paris (1921- 1945), Director of the \" Institut d'optique th\u00e9orique et appliqu\u00e9e \". 120 The International Union for Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), with its International Association for Meteorology (IAM) (now Intern a- tional Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences (IAMAS)), was the only relevant international organization that could appr o- priately host such a group of scientists interested in the atmospheric ozone. The IAMAS had only one permanent scientific commission on solar radiation formed in Madrid in 1924. At the Lisbon assembly in 1933 , the Radiation Commission, \"in recognition to the importance of ozone research for better understanding of the stratosphere\", established a Committee on Ozone; the members were Dobson, Fabry and G\u00f6tz. At that meeting two papers related to ozone: \"Report on Ozone Research\" by G. M. B. Dobson and F. W. P. G\u00f6tz and \"On the progress of the methods for study of atmospheric ozone\" by Ch. Fabry were presented. 121 The Int ernational Ozone Commission (IO 3C) was establis hed in 1948 at the Seventh Assembly of the International Union of Geode- sy and Geophysics (IUGG) as one of the special commissions (see Table 5). For more information on the early IO 3C history refer to Bojkov (2012). 122 The \"Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina\" has been the German National Academy of Sciences since 2008. 123 Refer to footnote 8 on page 3 . 34 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) G\u00f6tz communicated with many colleagues by letter. The correspondence of G\u00f6tz available in the LKO Archives is very extensive including as many as 35 folders covering scientific and technical as well as personal matters. The correspondence also demonstrates the capability and effectiveness of G\u00f6tz in networking. He had extensive correspondence with Dobson 124 (Sect. 3.7), Maurer 125, later Lugeon 126, Linke 127 his former PhD advisor Wolf 128 (Sect. 2.4), Chalonge 129 and many others. Scientific studies 3.5 3.5.1 Key scientific questions At the end of the 1920s the following questions were in the center of the scientific debate of the young atmospheric ozone research. The first network of F\u00e9ry instruments (Sect. 3.7.1) produced by Dobson in Oxford provided meas- urements of northern extratropics. At the most northern site of Abisko 130 data from the end of April until end of September were obtained, showing a tendency for an increase from the tropics to the High North (Dobson et al., 1929; G\u00f6tz, 1929a). Concerning the higher stratospheric ozone concen-tration in the winter months in the northern latitude as compared to the summer season 131 Ladenburg (1929) reflects the discussions at the International Ozone Conference in 1929 in Paris in the follow-ing way: \"Is it possible that sunlight is not the main determining factor in the generation of ozone 132? Perhaps the radiation, to which we owe the polar lights, contributes to the ozone formation, and the sun, which is very effective during the long days of the summer in the northern latitudes, induces primarily the destruction of the ozone. Therefore, special high ozone values should be measured in the High North in the autumn and a great dependence of these values on the polar lights be detec t- ed\" 133. G\u00f6tz (1929a) addressed these basic scientific questions in a similar way including more i n- strumental questions. Ladenburg underlines in his summary that data should be collected concerning these questions dur- ing G\u00f6tz's Svalbard expedition in the summer of 1929 134 (Sect. 3.8). Indeed, one of the main aims 124 Refer to footnote 91 on page 25. 125 Julius Maurer (1857- 1938 ), PhD, physicist, Director of MeteoSwiss (1905 -1934), President of the International Radiation Commi s- sion (1912 -1932). 126 Jean Lugeon (1898- 1976) , PhD, professor at the University of Z\u00fcrich, Director of MeteoSwiss (1943 -1963). 127 Karl Wilhelm Franz Linke (1878- 1944), PhD, D irector and Professor of the Institute for Meteorology and Geophysics , Goethe - University of Frankfurt a.

W. Pau l G\u00f6tz justifying the Svalbard measurements of G\u00f6tz described in Section 3.8 was the confirmation about the stratospheric ozone amount near the North Pole during the arctic summer. The measurements of G\u00f6tz from Svalbard in 1929 confirmed and extended the mean seasonal variation as well as the general increase of total ozone from the tropics toward the polar latitudes (see Dobson et al., 1930 135). However, the increase from the tropics to the High North was puzzling when accepting the general view of ozone production by shortwave (UV) solar light (G\u00f6tz, 1929a and 1933) as relatively short time to reach the equilibrium between ozone formation and destruction was assumed and not h- ing about transport of ozone was know at this time 136. To solve this scientific problem, G\u00f6tz assumed that additional processes are required and polar particles might be involved in stratospheric ozone depletion. One other key question was the atmospheric ozone profile. In this context G\u00f6tz started surface ozone measurements (Sect. 3.5.2) and in Section 3.8 entire atmospheric ozone profiles obtained by the Umkehr method and extending up to the upper stratosphere are described. Upon returning from Svalbard it was G\u00f6tz's intention to further investigate these topics and to extend the studies already underway in Arosa. Therefore, in collaboration with the Auroral Observatory of Troms\u00f8 137, he completed night time measurements of the ozone absorption made there with a quartz spectrograph with similar photo plates taken during full moon nights in March in Arosa (G\u00f6tz, 1935a). Several articles show that the northern lights visible from Arosa were one key topic of his research at this time; G\u00f6tz published papers on such phenomena every year between 1938 and 1942 (as well as in 1947) ( Annex 2 ). Encouraged by a proposal from Carl Stoermer 138 entitled \"The Importance of height determination of northern lights in central Europe\" 139, G\u00f6tz designed an observational network composed of three stations 140 to take simultaneous pictures and determine the height of the polar lights by triangulation. Besides this, G\u00f6tz expanded the observations to all kind of phenomena occur-ring in the sky; in a description summarizing his research topics (G\u00f6tz, 1935b) he then emphasi zed that the observation of air glow was considered as a new important research topic for the LKO as started in the 1930s 141. G\u00f6tz endeavoured to procure the adequate instruments for the planned observations and submitted a request to the University of Z\u00fcrich. In a response of 13 February 1933, the Foundation for Scientific Research at the University of Z\u00fcrich 142 agreed to finance the acquisition of a quartz spectrograph to 135 The measurement s of G\u00f6tz from Svalbard are included in Figure 1a on p. 417 of Dobson et al. (1930) underlining the high i m- portance of the data me asured by G\u00f6tz. 136 Similar questions were addressed by the PhD thesis of D\u00fctsch (Sec. 5.1) and they were finally solved by the detection of the Brewer Dobson circulation (Brewer, 1949), i.e. showing transport of ozone mainly formed in the tropics most of it being transported as inactive tracer into the extra tropics in the winter hemisphere. 137 Today: Troms\u00f8 Geophysical Observatory. 138 Carl St\u00f6rmer (1874- 1957), PhD, p rofessor at the University Blindern (near Oslo), Norway, chairman of the Northern Light C ommis- sion of the IUGG . 139 Document St\u00f6rmer, 193?

Concomitantly the astronomical observatory of University of G\u00f6ttingen was ready to start observations at Arosa with a specially developed instrument (\"interference disc\" 144). Cario 145 of the Physics Institute of the Tec h- nical University of Braunschweig also came to Arosa with his own spectrograph to make night time observations. A series of documents suggest that G\u00f6tz was originally even more ambitious. At the end of the 1920s he approached Brunner 146 of the astronomical institute of ETH Z\u00fcrich with the idea of defining com- mon research fields focused on solar observation. Brunner showed great interest (Brunner, 30 Oct o- ber 1929) but ultimately stayed behind 147. A few years later, Linke 148 assisted him in the tentative plan to establish an international \"solar station\" 149 at Arosa; Buisson 150 and probably other well - known scientists were contacted to start an international collaboration 151. According to G\u00f6tz 152, pre- liminary commitments of the federal authorities existed to support the operation of a federal research institute in Arosa through a TB foundation, but the initiative for obtaining financial support from the TB foundation was unsuccessful (Sect. 3.6.1). Note that the effect of the solar cycle on stratospheric ozone addressed by G\u00f6tz was also studied by D\u00fctsch (Sect. 5.1) and is still discussed today 153. 3.5.2 Selected scientific studies For estimating tropospheric ozone amount (surface ozone), measurements were made in the sur- roundings of Arosa in the 1930s by G\u00f6tz and Ladenburg (1931) and G\u00f6tz and Maier -Leibnitz (1933b) 154. Surface ozone measurements at Jungfraujoch (see also Section 9.1.3.h) extended the surface ozone measurements up to the elevations of 3466 m a.s.l. The investigations from Peppler (1930) and Peppler and G\u00f6tz (1931) underline the efforts of G\u00f6tz to study the environmental factors of Arosa in an extended and comprehensive way. From 4 November 1929 to 15 March 1930, 105 pilot balloons were launched 155 from Arosa and their paths were fol- 143 Letter/Form University of Z\u00fcrich, 14 February 1933.

Furthermore, the effect of cosmic rays on ozone is also discussed in the context of the variance of the solar cycle as described by chemical climate models (Funke et al., 2017). 154 For further information concerning surface ozone measurements in Arosa refer to Section 9.1.3.b. 155 At following hours: 10am - 11am and 2pm - 3pm. 37 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world' s longest atmospheric ozone measurements 3 1921 -1954: Period of F.

Arosa, situated at the end of the Schanfigg valley, is surrounded by high mountains (see Figure 2), which shield the village from the higher wind speeds that prevail at higher altitudes 156. Evolution of the LKO under G\u00f6tz 3.6 3.6.1 LKO support by the Rhaetian Railway and the Swiss tuberculosis fund As the financial situation of the LKO under G\u00f6tz was always difficult (Sect. 9.3), he tried to obtain additional support. The Railway Company Chur -Arosa (ChA Bahn) was sponsoring the LKO 157. Searches of Florian Ambauen (Rhaetian Railway Company) show how G\u00f6tz was able to obtain sup-port for the LKO from the ChA Railway. G\u00f6tz approached Gustav Bener 158, Director of the Rhaetian Railway Company. Bener who was member of the board committee of the ChA Railway Company proposed that the ChA Railway Company support the LKO 159. The minutes of the 123rd board com- mittee meeting, which took place on 3 December 1931, document that funding of the LKO by the ChA Railway Company was finally approved. Nevertheless, the protocol of the board committee meeting also documents that this financial contribution by the Railway Company was controversial at the 122nd meeting that took place on 24 October 1930 160; the documentation also includes a letter from the medical doctors of Arosa of 5 November 1930 supporting the request and underlining the strong need for the support. This shows that G\u00f6tz was a skilled networker as Bener obviously strong- ly supported the LKO 161. Documents obtained from the Swiss Federal Archives 162 demonstrate another initiative to obtain support for the LKO, namely from the Swiss tuberculosis fund. In a letter from 2 April 1932, G\u00f6tz reports to Vital 163 of the Federal Department of Home Affairs about a meeting with Carri\u00e8re 164 of the Office of Public Health, stating that it might be possible to obtain such support if the value of the LKO investigations to TB research could be demonstrated. However, Carri\u00e8re suggested first adapting the organization of the LKO to fulfill the formal prerequisites for such support. A draft of a deed of foun-dation was written. In a letter from the Department of Home Affairs (11 November 1932) we learn that the federal government was eventually ready to supervise the foundation. However, the pr o- posed deed of foundation would require adaptions, e.g. related to capital and increase of capital of foundation as well as to memberships.

The initiative was temporarily stopped (but never resumed). 3.6.2 Hedwig Kohn at the LKO PD Dr Hedwig Kohn is abbreviated as H.K in Table 3. This was a precautionary measure because, being Jewish, she was being hounded by the Nazi regime (refer to https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedwig_Kohn ). According to Winnewisser (2003 and 2016) Hedwig Kohn 165 was among the youngest female physicists following a research career in Germany, attai n- ing a habilitation 166 on 5 May 1930. However, she could not pursue her university career because she was Jewish. She was removed from the university teacher list in 1933 but was still able to con-tinue advising PhD students. She stayed at the LKO for 3 months in 1935 supported by a grant from an American organization of ex -Germans (German Scientists Relief Fund). We found about a do z- en letters 167 written by Kohn to G\u00f6tz from June 1935 to July 1939. Only one copy of the many letters addressed by G\u00f6tz to Kohn is in the LKO Archives. The first letters include scientific and logistic planning of her stay in Arosa. The topic of the study was UV sky measurements using the Arosa ultraviolet spectrograph (Sect. 9.1.2.a) . When Kohn returned home, some photographic plates were sent to her institute in Breslau and she informed G\u00f6tz about the analysis work, but apparently the progress was not as originally expected. In the letter dated 30 December 1936, we read that she obtained support from a grant to continue the study in Arosa, allowing her to stay there for 5 months , but that she only could travel to Arosa in the second part of 1937 due to other commitments. We do not know the reason why Kohn did not continue research at the LKO. According to a remark in G\u00f6tz and Sch\u00f6nmann (1948), she worked on an error analysis related to the Arosa ultraviolet spectr o- graph, but the study was not finished due to emigration 168. The letters demonstrate Kohn's continuous trials to get an opportunity to emigrate and her feelings alternating between hope and disappointment. She was obviously personally very grateful for the help and support from G\u00f6tz and his wife and the letters (after return to Germany) are very warmly written, always containing greetings to G\u00f6tz's wife. G\u00f6tz seems to have been moved by the Kohn's plight and seems to have taken care of her beyond the professional aspects. In a letter from 8 March 1939, Dobson mentioned that he got a letter from the Refugee Committee of the International Feder- ation of University Women with the request \"to advise them whether she [Hedwig Kohn] is likely to get scientific work here or in the Dominions\". He therefore asked G\u00f6tz about Hedwig Kohn as she was working for three months at the LKO in 1935. Hedwig Kohn was eventually able to emigrate to Sweden and subsequently to the USA in 1940 (Winnewisser, 2003) when World War II had already started. Her brother died in the Holocaust. Her emigration was initiated by Ladenburg 169. In the USA, Kohn first taught at the Women's College of North Carolina for a year and a half, and then from 1942 to her retirement in 1954 she was teaching at Wellesley College in Massachusetts (Wikipedia). 165 Hedwig Kohn (1887 - 1964), born in Breslau (Germany). 166 For description of the \"habilitation\" refer to Section 3.9.2. 167 Exclusively handwritten. 168 G\u00f6tz und Sch\u00f6nmann, 1948.

W. Paul G\u00f6tz 3.6.3 Plans to l eave Arosa Two (confidential) letters 170 show that G\u00f6tz considered options to leave Arosa in the 1930s. Linke was informed by Knoch 171 about the interest of G\u00f6tz in the planning of a German high alpine institute related to climate research. Linke wrote to G\u00f6tz discussing options for employment at a university institute connected to an astronomical observatory. G\u00f6tz acknowledged Linke's proposal in his reply and mentions that his position at Arosa was still not secured and that German nationality might be-come a difficulty concerning his expectations in Z\u00fcrich 172. However, G\u00f6tz also appreciated his oppor- tunities in Arosa having an autonomous (small) institute allowing him to earn income for his own survival and to perform his independent research. The letter ends with him stating that he would consider moving to Germany , but only if the new position were permanent and offer him the possibi l- ity of continuing his professional work 173. However, in 1940 it was not clear to G\u00f6tz whether he should continue to work in Arosa, which is also reflected in the correspondence between Dobson174 and G\u00f6tz (Sect. 3.7) and is surely due largely to diminishing finances during World War II (refer to Section 9.3.1.a) . A letter from 14 Aug 1940 written by G\u00f6tz to Zuber 175 describes G\u00f6tz's contacts with Colonel Isler 176, who suggested constructing an airport for gliders in Arosa. Obviously , such a project would have allowed G\u00f6tz to obtain additional support at least for instrumentation. In a letter to Colonel Isler at the end of 1940 we learn that Zuber was planning to meet him (Colonel Isler) in Bern, but G\u00f6tz expressed his disappointment that the LKO's budget had reached a minimum and that his wishes to obtain support for employees assisting him in the analysis of the measurements seemed unrealistic in the near future. In the last sentence of this letter we find that G\u00f6tz rejected an offer from the University of Frankfurt to succeed Linke be- cause he preferred to stay in the Alps 177. In a letter from 7 March 1940, Linke mentions that he got the impression that G\u00f6tz and his wife wished to leave Arosa when he visited them. Already in an earlier letter (5 January 1939) Linke r e- grets that the University of Z\u00fcrich did not offer G\u00f6tz a full professorship 178, which he felt would be appropriate, because in Switzerland \"nobody cares\" about G\u00f6tz 179. In the same letter Linke writes about his attempts to find a position for G\u00f6tz in his group at the University of Frankfurt. However, the 170 Letters Linke, 5 September 1935 and G\u00f6tz, 17 September 1935. 171 Karl Heinrich Knoch (1983- 1972, PhD , professor, Director of the German Weather Service ( Reichswetterdienst) (1935 -1945). 172 Certainly the University of Z\u00fcrich is meant; however, this concer n obviously turned out to be wrong at least concerning his promotion to honorary professor that took place in in July 1940 (Sect. 3.9.2 ). 173 Letter G\u00f6tz, 17 September 1935.

Linke also brings up his intention to create a new institute with a strong emphasis on astrophysics and geophysics, which, however, would need additional resources that might have become available in 1939. It is clear that Linke made an offer to G\u00f6tz during 1939, which is not available to us, but G\u00f6tz asked Cario 182 for his opinion and advice about Linke's offer. Cario 183 pointed out that Linke's offer was problematic because of the following points: (1) the position offered by Linke was one of a senior assistant with a rather modest salary and retirement funds were not mentioned (which would need clarification); (2) it was felt that the institute should, at least, offer G\u00f6tz a position of an extraordinary professorship; (3) the possibility, obviously included in the offer, that G\u00f6tz could follow Linke as pr o- fessor at the university of Frankfurt was considered to be too uncertain. Cario suggested to G\u00f6tz to be careful about this promise as it would not be feasible to give G\u00f6tz any formal certainty on this important point. Cario suggested that G\u00f6tz should insist that the new institute 184 would be formally independent and chaired by G\u00f6tz 185. Only in this case G\u00f6tz could avoid possible difficulties if another younger colleague would obtain Linke's professorship 186. Ostensibly G\u00f6tz wrote 187 to Linke informing him of his decision not to leave Arosa because he want- ed to continue to stay in the Alps, as acknowledged by Linke on 7 March 1940 (see above). Linke was also in discussion with G\u00f6tz about another option for a professorship (letter of G\u00f6tz to Linke, 22 August 1942): Wagner 188, professor at the University of Innsbruck, had passed away and seemingly G\u00f6tz was interested in getting this professorship. We do not know whether this was pursued. Linke died on 23 March 1944 from a stroke while helping to extinguish a fire caused by a bomb attack. From the information of naturalization ( Appendix 2) we learn that G\u00f6tz also obtained the offer of a professorship at the University of Vienna. 3.6.4 Medical development of the resort areas In 1942, in a letter to Maron 189, G\u00f6tz was referring to a newspaper article probably describing the success of the construction of the new observatory for the Institute of Snow and Avalanche R e- search 190 at Weissfluhjoch 191 and compared the situation between Davos and Arosa. The letter 180 Fritz M\u00f6ller (1906- 1983) completed his PhD at the University of Frankfutt in 1928, \"Observator\" at the Universities of Frankfurt and Leipzig (1938 -1948), Professor of Meterology and Geophysics at the University of Mainz (1948 -1960), Professor at the University of Munich (1960 -1972). 181 Reichsamt f\u00fcr Wetterdienst (see Wikipedia). 182 Refer to footnote 145 on page 36. 183 Letter Cario, 28 February 1940.

W. Paul G\u00f6tz shows his disappointment: \"Is it normal that I need to think after 21 very successful years whether it would be acceptable to stay here in Arosa further or whether it would be more appropriate to move to another place where I receive an acceptable salary and some safety to survive when I am old?\" 192. He complains that the community of Davos was able to obtain much better support for the SFI 193 and claiming that in Davos all actors including the public community, medical doctors etc. worked toget h- er. In the letter from 22 September 1942, he proposed to reconsider the proposal of 1924, namely the fusion of the institutes of Davos with Arosa (Sect. 3.2). G\u00f6tz argues that in 1942 the condition for such a merger would be much better for Arosa than in 1924 when the doctors of Arosa stopped fur-ther negotiations. He also remarked that it could be useful to strengthen the institute of Davos, though did not know about the possible reaction of Davos. The institute could be renamed from \"Schweizerisches Forschungsinstitut in Davos\" to \".... und Arosa\" and include the following four parts (1) an observatory with a focus on geophysical research, located in Arosa and run by G\u00f6tz; (2) an observatory with a focus on bioclimatology, located in Davos and run by M\u00f6rikofer 194; (3) a bacteri o- logical- anatomical institute, located in Davos and run by Berblinger; and (4) an institute for physiol o- gy, located in Davos, which needed to be restarted again. G\u00f6tz also pointed out that he was teaching at the University of Z\u00fcrich and his colleague M\u00f6rikofer at the University Basel. We do not know whether this idea was discussed further. G\u00f6tz was obviously not satisfied with the financial support for his research 195. This can be doc u- mented in many cases. In the short reports written for the KVV Arosa (Sect. 3.4), it is also indicated several times that the research activities at the LKO were limited because of restrained financial support to hire assistants both for performing field observations as well as for interpreting the many measurements. In AR 1935 we read: \"In neighboring countries the research of climate of resort areas obtains strong national support whereas the observatory [LKO] does not even obtain cantonal sup-port\" 196. In the surveys intended to the Society of Natural Sciences of the Grisons (G\u00f6tz, 1938), G\u00f6tz also stressed the need for more appropriate financial resources to afford assistance in performing the measurements , which were already well known in the international scientific community. In the second part of World War II a rather broad program aimed at the medical development of the resort areas 197, dubbed \"climatological action\" 198 for short, was prepared in Switzerland with the main goal of supporting scientific activities to put the Swiss alpine health and touristic resorts in a good position for the time when the war would end. The funding originated from the Swiss Federal Office for Transport 199 and a commission 200 prepared the decision about the support of the individual 191 Test field of SLF established in autumn 1936 at the Weissfluhjoch (2693 m a.s.l. ) above Davos. 192 Letter G\u00f6tz, 21 September 1921.

We found relevant documents in the Swiss Federal Archives 201. In a document from 30 April 1943 sent to the Federal Office for Transport, Maron asked for annual support for the LKO of 5,000 CHF for several years, pointing out the scientific merits of G\u00f6tz and the strong demand for support. In a letter from 2 October 1943, G\u00f6tz informed Trenkel 202 about a phone call from von Neergard 203 declaring that the decision about the proposal would be taken on 14 October and that M\u00f6rikofer from Davos had applied for three assistants, adding to the 7 assistants and other staff already available. Von Neergard also wanted to discuss whether the medical doctors of Arosa would be interested in contributing to the studies of the \"climatological action\". G\u00f6tz wrote two letters on 15 October, one to Maron and the other to Trenkel. He informed Maron that he obtained, in another phone call from von Neergard, confidential information from the meeting in Bern that G\u00f6tz's proposal (formally proposed by the KVV Arosa) for contribution to the \"climatological action\" was rejected because of M\u00f6rikofer's vote arguing that G\u00f6tz's work was not related to the climatology of Arosa; von Muralt 204, the only expert in the commission who could have corrected M\u00f6rikofer's view, was not present at the meeting and von Neergard was even unsuccessful in asking for an external review of a neutral expert. In the same letter, we learn that Davos made a proposal for 2,000,000 CHF with plans to get a very large institute and that in the following week the governing council of the Grisons was planning to travel to Davos; von Neergard recommended that a repr e- sentative of Arosa should travel immediately to Gadient 205 in Chur so that Arosa could also have a chance to receive some support. The letter sent to Trenkel contains the same information including the remark that he was informed about ten years ago by Bener 206 (Sect. 3.6.1), that he (Bener) r e- buffed M\u00f6rikofer after a meeting in Davos in which a Federal Councillor 207 from Bern was present about the statement that the observatory at Arosa was superfluous as this work could be done by his institute in Davos. G\u00f6tz added that M\u00f6rikofer might like to get rid of him as he probably had problems comparing himself with him; M\u00f6rikofer might have been a brilliant agitator but not a successful scien- tist 208 with modest scientific results when considering he had 10 assistants 209. In the official minutes of the meeting 210 we find that Cottier 211, the president of the committee, de- clared that the proposal from Arosa could not be decided in this meeting, but that he would like to 201 Refer to footnote 162 on page 37. 202 Refer to footnote 39 on page 12. 203 Kurt von Neergard (1887 -1947), PhD, Professor of Physical T herapy at the University of Z\u00fcrich (1940- 1947) treating problems of lung pressure. 204 Alexander Ludwig von Muralt (1903- 1990), PhD, Professor of Physiology of the University of Bern (with an education in medicine and physics), President of the International Foundation of the High Altitude Research Stations Jungfraujoch and Gornergrat HF SJG (1937 -1973), founder of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) in 1952. 205 Andreas G adient (1892 -1976), member of the governing Council of the Grisons ( Regierungsrat des Kanton Graub\u00fcnden) (1939 -1947) . 206 Refer to footnote 158 on page 37. 207 Bundesrat. 208 Letter G\u00f6tz, 15 October 1943 (to Trenkel).

W. Paul G\u00f6tz hear the opinions from members of the commission. M\u00f6rikofer spoke about the excellent scientific reputation of G\u00f6tz, however, it appears not obvious to him how to include G\u00f6tz in the program as his expertise was in astronomy. Nevertheless, one could discuss this with G\u00f6tz in order to give him an opportunity to contribute to the study program. In a letter from 26 November 1943 to Cottier, M\u00f6r i- kofer states that he had asked G\u00f6tz to discuss the matter with him; however, he believed that it would be difficult to coordinate his own research activities with G\u00f6tz's project due to financial and psychological aspects. In the letter from 11 November 1943 written to the KVV Arosa (to be sent to the Director of the Fed-eral Office for Transport) G\u00f6tz presented a new concept to justify measurements at the LKO for soc i- ety. G\u00f6tz writes about priorities of research of resort areas (illustrated by his publications) and com-pares this research to the study of \"natural resources\" by an industrial company as the climate should be viewed as the \"natural resource\" of resort areas. Remarkable in this letter are investigations of pilot balloons (Sect. 3.5.2) to study the wind conditions indicating the strong protection of the alpine wind field by the orography of Arosa 212 and the high value of air quality for the comparison of resort areas. G\u00f6tz argued that the low air quality in cities goes along with low ozone concentration whereas the high air quality of resort areas is characterized by high ozone values as it was believed at this time that ozone originates exclusively from the stratosphere 213. Cottier asked von Muralt in a letter from 6 December 1943 about his opinion to support the LKO based on the proposal from 11 November 1943. Cottier clarifies that he originally found it feasible to include the LKO's activities in M\u00f6rikofer's project, also possibly with respect to financial matters, but that he changed his opinion thinking that such an approach would be hardly practical due to personal as well as financial aspects. The written review of von Muralt , which is included in the protocol of the fourth meeting of the commission of 16 December 1943, indicates that von Muralt supported the proposal of the KVV Arosa (LKO) because of G\u00f6tz's internationally well- known research in climate research. G\u00f6tz presented two programs, namely a minimal version asking to analyze measurements of Arosa including additional measurements of wind flow and radiation and a maximal program i n- cluding additional studies of air pollutants and UV transparency. Von Muralt strongly favored the maximal program. It was discussed whether the Swiss Academy for Medicine could be interested in financing the program, which had been denied. The commission eventually supported the proposal unanimously 214. M\u00f6rikofer recommended that the program should not be defined too narrowly as the progress might depend on the availability of capable employees and that the KVV Arosa should not be allowed to reduce the support for the LKO. The decision was communicated in a letter dated 5 January 1944, which was sent from the Federal Department of Post and Railways 215 to the KVV Arosa. This was forwarded to G\u00f6tz by Zuber on 14 January 1944. This support had been very important for a reorientation of the LKO as it enabled several staff members to be employed (see Table 20 in Sect. 9.3.2). The well -known surface ozone measurements of Arosa (G\u00f6tz and Volz, 1951, Staehelin et al., 1994), that were continued by Perl 212 And other aspects concerning synoptic meteorology such as foehn . 213 Note that ozone concentration is lower in polluted areas due to reaction with nitrogen oxide (NO) and dry deposition (decomposition at the Earth's surface). 214 For financial amount refer to Section 9.3.2. 215 Eidgen\u00f6ssisch es Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) (1965), were therefore performed (Sect. 9.1.3.b) and measurements of atmospheric electricity were undertaken, in collaboration with the University of Fribourg, Switzerland (Sect. 9.1.3.c) . G\u00f6tz subsequently made continuous attempts to obtain additional funding from other (external) sources. Collaboration between G\u00f6tz and Dobson (University of Oxford, UK) 3.7 The close collaboration of G\u00f6tz with Dobson 216 was very important for G\u00f6tz's career. The following section starts with a short overview of the basics of ground- based instruments to measure total ozone 217. 3.7.1 S un spectrophotometers for total ozone measurements in the Huggins band The intensity of the solar light at the surface with an approximate wavelength between 300 and 350 nm is diminished through (i) absorption by atmospheric ozone (see Figure 15 ) (ii) Rayleigh scatter- ing 218 and (iii) scattering and absorption by atmospheric aerosols. Total ozone determination is based on measuring the difference between the intensity at two wavelengths (wavelength pairs) because the strong decrease in ozone absorption cross sections with increasing wavelength (see spectrum in Figure 15, left side) allows precise ozone measurements. The design of instruments to measure column ozone 219 differs by (i) wavelengths pairs used, (ii) the dispersive element to separate the wavelengths and (iii) the detection system. Dobson was very successful in constructin g sun spectrophotometers for reliable (stratospheric) ozone measurements (Walshaw, 1989). He first designed and constructed the F\u00e9ry spectrometer (see Figure 16, top). Ozone was determined from three different wavelength pairs (see Figure 15, right side) and the si g- nal was detected by photographic plates. Dobson improved the measurement technique with a novel optical design leading to the Dobson spectrophotometers containing two dispersive elements (see Figure 16). This minimized interf erence by internal stray light. 216 Refer to footnote 91 on page 25. 217 Such instruments are also used to measure ozone vertical distribution by the Umkehr method, refer to Section 3.7.1. 218 Elastic scattering of light or other electromagnetic radiation by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. These particles may be individual atoms or molecules. 219 Fabry and Buisson (1921) first presented precise total ozone measurements. In 1926, G\u00f6tz ordered an ozone instrument based on the Fabry -Buisson design from the company Schmidt -Haensch (Berlin), which was delivered in 1928 and which he called the \" Aroser Ultraviolett Spektrograph\" (G\u00f6tz, 1929b) (Sect. 9.1.2.a) . 45 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory A rosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 3 1921 -1954: Period of F.

The Dobson spectrophotometers are consecutively numbered, e.g. D15 means Dobson spectropho- tometer (fabrication) number 15. The signals were first detected by photoelectric devices, which were replaced by photomultipliers when available 220. Most precise total ozone measurements are obtained by direct sun observation. The retrieval of total ozone needs to take into account the ozone absor p- tion cross section at the wavelengths used (pairs) and improved knowledge from laboratory meas-urements of ozone absorption cross section, which increase accuracy in total ozone data 221. Ray- leigh scattering needs to be included in the ozone retrieval depending on atmospheric pressure at the site of measurement. In addition, aerosols (besides sulfur dioxide 222) can falsify total ozone measurements, which can be important in polluted urban areas such as Oxford. Several wavelength pairs were tested for ozone determination before the AD wavelength pairs (see Figure 15, right side) were selected as the World standard for total ozone measurement in the International Geophysical Year (IGY) 223 in 1957/58 in order to minimize aerosol interference 224. The basic methods of the pr e- sent network of Dobson instruments and some data series go back to IGY (Staehelin, 2008; Dlugokencky, et al., 2010). Note that the Dobson network still forms a basis for global stratospheric ozone monitoring. 220 Around the end of World War II. 221 The ozone absorption cross section in the Huggins band (see Figure 15) depends on temperature (Sect. 7.6.2 ). 222 Note that the interference by SO 2 is also important but cannot be removed by AD measurements. 223 The International Geophy sical Y ear (IGY) was an international project that lasted from 1 July 1957 to 31 December 1958 . Marcel Nicolet (Belgian physicist and meteorologist, who stayed at the LKO for several months in the 1930s, Sect. 9.1.3.g) was secretary ge n- eral of the associated international organization (see Wikipedia). Lugeon was responsible of the Swiss contribution. 224 Note that aerosol absorption and scattering only weakly depend on wavelength in this wavelength range and therefore its effects can be minimized when using two wavelengths pairs. 46 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Ins titute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) Figure 16: Instruments designed by Dobson for stratospheric ozone observation.

W. Paul G\u00f6tz ering scientific, technical and also personal topics until G\u00f6tz's death in 1954. About 350 letters and cards (mostly addressed from Dobson to G\u00f6tz 225) (Annex 6, T able 2) are in the LKO Archives. The exchange is always characterized by a profound respect and great confidence. When G\u00f6tz started to Figure 17: First letter G\u00f6tz sent to Dobson on 11 November 1925 about a possible collaboration concerning ozone measurements with spectrophotometers 226 (one of the few letters from G\u00f6tz to Dobson existing in the LKO Archives).

My measurements up to day are done with a photoelectric cadmium -cell. A photographic quartz -spectrograph (considering the experience of Fabry Buisson) is ordered. But I don't expect him for some time perhaps as long as six months (the micr o- photometer is ready). Is there any possibility that I could be supplied with identical outfit? Specially in autumn and winter our climate of 1870 meters is best, and now and then I undertake excursions to other heights up to the height of Jungfraujoch (3500 meters). ..... I shall communicate your letter also to Prof. Maurer Z\u00fcrich. Awaiting your detailed proposal and hoping, we may agree on an arrangement. Yours very sincerely....\". 227 The following instrument s from Dobson were used for total ozone measurements at the LKO Arosa: A F\u00e9ry spectrograph (\"D2\") from 1926 to 1939, a photoelectric spectrop hotometer (D7) from 1939 to 1949 and photomultiplier systems after 1949: D15 in the period 1949- 1992, D101 since 1966 and D62 since 1992 (for details see Section 9.1.2.b) . 48 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) Figure 18: Response (first part) of Dobson from 17 December 1925 to G\u00f6tz's letter (11 November 1925, see Figure 17 above) making available a spectrophotometer to the LKO in the context of a European network e stablished by Dob- son 228. This led to the total ozone series which started in Arosa on 23 July 1926 229. (Letter LKO Archives ).

Many times, Dobson emphasizes in the letters to G\u00f6tz (i.e. 31 December 1947) the most favorable measuring conditions of Arosa. He was also very much impressed by the remarkable skill of G\u00f6tz in the performance of the measurements 230. For these reasons Dobson considered Arosa to be a n ideal place not only to perform ozone measurements but also to make instruments calibrations or to test measuring methods (Sect. 9.1.2.b) . He visited Arosa several times, alone or with an assistant or with his wife, where he was a guest in G\u00f6tz's Villa Firnelicht (Sect. 3.3.1). Some remarks in letters from Dobson to G\u00f6tz indicate that he was well informed about the LKO's very critical situation at the beginning of World War II 231 (Dobson, 13 April & 13 June & 2 October 1940) and that G\u00f6tz consi d- ered leaving Arosa at that time (Sect. 3.6.3). 228 Text (part) of the letter of 17 December 1925 (Dobson to G\u00f6tz): \"Dear Dr G\u00f6tz, Please excuse me for not replying to your lett er before. I am very glad you will be able to cooperate in getting your measurements. I did not reply before, until I had been able to see the Director of the London Meteorological Office. He had kindly undertaken to make arrangements for getting some observations made for us abroad & I did not known how far he might have got all our available spectrographs already allotted to different people. I find we shall have a spectrograph free & I shall be very pleased to send it to you. [.......]\". 229 Only 31 of the 368 letters/cards/notes addressed by Dobson to G\u00f6tz from 9 November 1925 to 31 December 1954 (found in the LKO archives) are written by hand. 230 Document of IUGG - Sub-Committee on Atmospheric Ozone, drafted by Dobson, President of the Sub- Committee, 1929. Original text: \"Dr. G\u00f6tz obtained good results [on moonlight] wit h of our F\u00e9ry type instruments at Spitzbergen during the summer, but there is great doubt whether an observer without Dr. G\u00f6tz's experience of this type of instrument would obtain good result.\" 231 Letter Dobson, 13. April 1940. \" I sincerely hope that your observatory will not be closed down .\". 49 Scien tific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 3 1921 -1954: Period of F. W. Paul G\u00f6tz The cooperation was particularly close regarding G\u00f6tz's Svalbard expedition and the Umkehr meas- urements of Arosa (Sect. 3.8). However, Figure 40 in Section 7.4.1 shows Dobson's team was not infallible. The many letters from Dobson to G\u00f6tz also demonstrate the personal friendship between the two men. As an example, Dobson also asked G\u00f6tz whether his son Desmond could come to Arosa. He was barely 20 years old 232 and his father encouraged him to learn German. This plan to all appear- ances couldn't be realized, but G\u00f6tz arranged that Dobson's son could finally stay in Z\u00fcrich together with Meyer 233 (Sect. 3.9). It appears that Dobson also approached G\u00f6tz to help Regener 234 to em i- grate from Germany. Expedition to Svalbard and Umkehr measurements 3.8 One of the most outstanding findings of G\u00f6tz's exceptional scientific career was determining the first realistic atmospheric ozone profiles using an experimental approach based on the Umkehr effect (G\u00f6tz et al., 1934a), also called the G\u00f6tz effect in some earlier publications (ref. e.g. Vassy, 1965). G\u00f6tz discovered the Umkehr effect by analyzing measurements collected during an expedition in Svalbard (G\u00f6tz, 1931b and D\u00fctsch, 1992). 3.8.1 Open scientific questions in the late 1920s In the late 1920s, ozone profile determination (Sect. 3.5.1) was one of the open key scientific ques- tions in atmospheric ozone research as confirmed by many letters exchanged between Dobson and G\u00f6tz between 1927 and 1929 235. Information on the height of the ozone layer was derived in these years from direct sun measurements at low sun elevation angles. Using this method, G\u00f6tz and Dob- son determined an averaged altitude of about 40- 50 km above mean see level for Arosa (G\u00f6tz and Dobson, 1928). Because of the difficulty of direct sun observations when the sun is near to the hor i- zon, due to increased scattering, Cabannes and Dufay (1927) suggested a more appropriate ap- proach. The proposed method was designed to allow determination of the height of the ozone layer by measuring the zenithal light at different sun elevation angles near to sunrise or sunset. As discussed in Section 3.5, it was important to obtain more information on the thickness and the height of the ozone layer at high latitudes. In the correspondence between Dobson and G\u00f6tz, the name of Svalbard (more precisely Spitsbergen) in Norway appears as early as 1927 (Dobson, 18 May 1927). Svalbard is mentioned as one possible place where ozone measurements should be performed in the worldwide network 236 planned by Dobson after the accomplishment of the Europe- 232 Exact date of birth not known to us. Dobson married in 1914 and he had three children, 1 daughter and two sons (in this seque nce); Desmond was the elder son. 233 Edgar Meyer (1879 -1960), PhD, Professor of Physics of the University Z\u00fcrich (1916- 1949) . 234 Erich Regener (1881 -1955), atmospheric scientist, Professor for Experimental Physics at the University of Stuttgart. Regener's wife originated from a Jewish family and therefore his son (Victor) needed to emigrate from Germany whereas Regener himself was able to stay in Germany. 235 Among others: Dobson, 9 September 1927 & 17 March 1928 & 7 May 1929. 236 In addition to Table Mountain in California, Helwan in Egypt, Kodal Kanal in India and Christchurch in New Zealand besides Arosa in Switzerland and Oxford in the UK. 50 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) an Campaign in 1926- 1927 237 (Dobson, 1968; Dobson and Harrison, 1926; Dobson et al., 1927). Dobson tried to establish an operational station in Svalbard in collaboration with the Norwegian Weather service. In a letter from 23 January 1928, Dobson reported to G\u00f6tz that the Norwegian Weather Ser vice had given a positive answer to his request, but the project was very uncertain be- cause of organizational and technical problems. The intention was therefore expressed by G\u00f6tz as early as 1927 to conduct an expedition to Svalbard; this was supported by Dobson as follows (Dob- son, 23 January 1928): \"it will be very much satisfactory if you can go there as you hope\". 3.8.2 Scientific goals and objectives of G\u00f6tz's expedition to Svalbard The general motivation and scientific objectives of the Svalbard expedition (for organization and realization refer to Section 3.8.3) can be found in different documents 238. Based on studies by Kestner (1927) who stressed the analogy between the climates of the short polar summer and the summer in the Alps, reflected in the existing physiological similarities between the life forms in both environments 239, G\u00f6tz was convinced of the need for more research studies in the High North. He concluded (G\u00f6tz, 1929a) that it would be highly desirable to complement the planned distribution of Dobson spectrophotographs over the world by conducting measurements in Svalbard 240. In the application letter of his funding request concerning the Svalbard expedition (G\u00f6tz, 24 Nove m- ber 1928 241) G\u00f6tz was referring to an article published earlier (G\u00f6tz, 1927) with observations bas ed on Dobson's first ozone measuring network showing for the first time that the thickness of the ozone layer , which is increasing from the equator towards the north decreased from the 60\u00b0 latitude on to the pole (Sect. 3.5.1). G\u00f6tz claimed that according to Dobson the observations in the High North would be one of the most urgent contributions for the ozone problem at that time 242. A declared goal of G\u00f6tz for the Svalbard expedition was to perform, besides radiation measurements, mainly obser- vations of the atmospheric ozone, covering both total ozone content and the height of the ozone layer. G\u00f6tz described some key elements of the measuring program of the Svalbard expedition in a letter to Dobson (27 December 1928). There he points out that May and June and the second half of August would be favorable for the application of the method of Cabannes and Dufay concerning the determ i- nation of the height of the ozone layer. In his publication of the Svalbard results (G\u00f6tz, 1931b) it is mentioned that prior to the expedition he performed some trials to test the applicability of this method 237 Dobson, 1967: \"The British Meteorological Office was helpful in allowing measurements to be made at Valentia, Ireland, and Le r- wick, Shetland, and also by arranging with other meteorological services for measurements to be made at Abisko, Sweden, and Linden- berg, Germany. Dr. G\u00f6tz kindly undertook to operate an instrument at Arosa, Switzerland.\". 238 We could not find any detailed research plan as it is common practice in a modern research proposal. 239 It was postulated that this parallelism could be related to the fact that the transparency of UV light in summer time in the High North is closer to the conditions of Jungfraujoch than of Hamburg. 240 G\u00f6tz, 1929a. Original 241 Only a stenographic draft version of the proposal submitted to the German Research Foundation is available; the information provi d- ed is based on a transcription by an expert on stenography. 242 Letter G\u00f6tz, 24 November 1928 (stenographic draft): Auch Dr. Dobson, mit 51 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmos pheric ozone measurements 3 1921 -1954: Period of F. W. Paul G\u00f6tz in Arosa. From this it is quite obvious that G\u00f6tz went to the Svalbard with the idea of using Cabannes' and Dufay's method (1927) for the determination of the ozone layer height. 3.8.3 Planning and realization of the expedition In 1927, G\u00f6tz contacted the German Research Foundation 243 asking for the possibility of funding his Svalbard expedition. On 24 November 1928 G\u00f6tz wrote an official request to this institution. Although verbal acceptance was signified earlier by the German Research Foundation, he received the defini- tive positive response to his application with a letter from 6 March 1929, which agreed with the pr o- posed budget 244. Quite a number of letters in the LKO Archives demonstrate that the preparation for the expedition was rather laborious and time- consuming. G\u00f6tz prepared everything very conscientiously and sy s- tematic ally. He contacted a number of experts (in Germany, Norway and Svalbard) who could assist him in organizing the travel, finding an appropriate place for the measurements 245 and providing him support on site. With the permission of the Kings Bay Kul Company 246 he was able to install the instruments in the cabin of the Nobile expedition from 1928, close to the airship hall (see Figure 19).

Although it seems that he had some assurance concerning such a flight (G\u00f6tz, 24 A u- gust 1928), the Zeppelin trip could not be realized, and he was obliged to reach Svalbard by train and ship. He left Arosa on 12 June 1929 and arrived in Ny -\u00c5lesund on 30 June 1929 247. The departure in Troms\u00f8 was delayed because of ice still present on the route to Svalbard. At the end of the stay, G\u00f6tz had to leave Svalbard on 5 September due to early winter conditions; he was back in Arosa on 21 September 1929. He therefore spent much less time in Svalbard than initially anticipated. G\u00f6tz was accompanied in this expedition by Emil Henssler, who was already meteorological assistant in the previous years at Arosa 248. G\u00f6tz performed different kinds of field measurements at Svalbard. Several instruments were trans- ported and set up (G\u00f6tz, 1931b). Two systems were used for the ozone observations. Dobson initia l- ly intended to offer a special instrument for the campaign to prevent interruption of the measur e- ments in Arosa during summer. However, a spectrograph lent by Dobson to Professor Pontremoli was out of service as it was damaged in the crash on of the Nobile airship Italia in Svalbard during the polar expedition of Nobile in 1928 249. The spectrograph returned to Oxford during 1929 but had to be refurbished and was therefore not available for G\u00f6tz's Svalbard campaign. Finally, the following instruments for ozone measurements were used: a spectrograph of F\u00e9ry type for total ozone obser-vations 250 and a spectrograph of the Fabry -Buisson type for the zenith sky measurements (G\u00f6tz, 1931b) 251. The instruments were back in Arosa by 28 September 252. G\u00f6tz was writing a diary 253 during the travel and his stay in Svalbard; the report contains (for almost every day) remarks on the measurements, the many meetings with other persons, the weather condi-tions and the various excursions on the island. This travel diary covering the whole expedition shows G\u00f6tz as a well -educated scientist and an excellent observer interested in a large range of aspects, in the style of many scientists of the 19th century. Although the information in this diary about the measurements is rather limited, it can be concluded that the weather conditions were quite challeng-ing, especially for the zenith observations at sun elevation angles near sunrise resp. sunset, and furthermore that the presence of smoke in Kings Bay was interfering with the measurements. G\u00f6tz relied on these extensive notes to write the two travel reports (G\u00f6tz, 1929c and 1929d) printed in the newspaper of Arosa 254 during the summer in which the conditions of the expedition are described with a note of irony and a good sense of humor. He also noted in the diary that he reported twice to the German funding institution 255 of the expedition 256. 247 For travelling route see L\u00e4ubli 2019. 248 It could not be established how long and in which years Henssler was meteorological assistant. 249 Umberto Nobile (1885- 1978), an Italian arctic explorer, reached the pole with his airship Italia on 24 May 1928. On the way back the ship ran into a storm and crashed onto the pack ice on 25 May 1928. Nobile and nine members of the crew were thrown to the ice as the gondola was smashed and survived; the six others were trapped in the buoyant superstructure and disappear ed definitively (Wikipedia). G\u00f6tz was accommodated in the hut occupied by Nobile at Ny -\u00c5lesund. 250 This was the F\u00e9ry instrument (\"D2\") made available by Dobson and normally operated in Arosa. 251 The Arosa ultraviolet spectrograph designed by G\u00f6tz (G\u00f6tz, 19 29b) with a much higher sensitivity (Sect. 9.1.2 ). 252 The F\u00e9ry spectrograph had suffered damage during transit and required repair in Oxford. 253 A typed tra nscript of the handwritten text is presented in Appendix 2. 254 Refer to footnote 8 on page 3. 255 Refer to footnote 111 on page 30. 256 These reports could unfortunately not be found. 53 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 3 1921 -1954: Period of F. W. Paul G\u00f6tz 3.8.4 Description of the scientific results of the Svalbard expedition The scientific results of the expedition to Svalbard are presented in a publication that was the thesis of G\u00f6tz's habilitation (G\u00f6tz, 1931b) accepted by University of Z\u00fcrich in 1931 (Sect. 3.9). During his stay in Svalbard G\u00f6tz was able to perform total ozone observations on roughly 75% of the days 257. From the notes in the journal it is evident that the sky was very often at least partially overcast and that measurements with the sun near to the horizon where height determination was possible were only feasible on a limited number of days 258. Because of lack of sensitivity, such measurements were normally al most impossible with the first -generation spectrographs (even with the Arosa UV - spectrograph). At the latitudes of Svalbard, the slow move of the sun at midnight helped to compen-sate for this drawback 259. However, he stressed the risk of atmospheric ozone changes during the long measuring times. As proposed by Cabannes and Dufay (1927), a series of observations at 3 ( sometimes 2) sun elev a- tion angles near to the horizon (typically 21\u00b0, 9\u00b0 and 1\u00b0) were realized by G\u00f6tz. The plates were ana- lyzed 260 when G\u00f6tz returned back from the expedition 261. The fact that the observed intensity ratio of two pairs of adjacent elevation angles (with the higher angles above) is decreasing at short wavelengths and that they are intersecting each other lets G\u00f6tz conclude (G\u00f6tz, 1931b) \"the lower the position of the sun and the shorter the wavelength (i.e., the stronger the absorption), the more light is capable to prevail relative to the strongly reduced beam, finding the way through the ozone layer not totally but partially in the short zenithal pathway.\" 262. G\u00f6tz called the features of this finding Umkehr (inversion) effect (see Figure 20), although this does not yet correspond to the Umkehr curves (see Figure 22 ) resul ting from the so- called Umkehr met h- od (Sect. 3.8.5). 257 Total ozone could be measured on 46 of 63 measuring days. 258 Data for determination of the height of the ozone layer were available for 16 days, half of them were considered to be satisfactory. G\u00f6tz used three methods for height determination in the thesis of habilitation. It is not specified on how many days the method of Cabannes and Dufay could be applied. Only two cases are presented i n G\u00f6tz (1931b). 259 From comments of G\u00f6tz (1931 b) it can be assumed that in the planning of the expedition, he must have been aware of this ad- 260 With the aid of a microphotometer of Hartmann type. 261 This explains why almost no information on the measurement results is contained in the diary. 262 G\u00f6tz, 1931 b.

It was the deep scientific understanding of atmospheric short -wave radiation combined with his i n- sight that allowed G\u00f6tz to realize that the sequence of zenith sky observat ions contains valuable information for determining the vertical distribution of ozone (G\u00f6tz, 1931b and 1931c). 3.8.5 Development and results of the method G\u00f6tz mentions in his habilitation thesis (G\u00f6tz, 1931b) that he communicated his results to Dobson in September 1930 (one year after being back from Svalbard). According to Dobson's paper on ozone history (Dobson, 1968) G\u00f6tz was suggesting that the intensity ratio of two wavelengths, as measured by the new photoelectric spectrophotometer under development by Dobson in Oxford at that time, should show comparable behavior at low sun elevation angles. Dobson was rather skeptical. Never- theless, the strongly improved sensitivity of the new photoelectric system gave Dobson the oppor- tunity to make such zenith sky measurements near to the horizon, even in the Oxford location, and he tested G\u00f6tz's suggestion on a clear morning at the beginning of January 1931. Dobson comment-ed on the results to G\u00f6tz in a letter in the following days (Dobson, 8 January 1931) and conf irmed G\u00f6tz's hypothesis (see Figure 21). 55 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institu te of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 3 1921 -1954: Period of F.

Thus, the classical Umkehr curve was born representing the behavior of the intensity ratio of two wavelengths against the solar elevation angle near to sunrise resp. sunset. Dobson repeated this experiment and performed a series of 4 such measurements on 25- 27 January 1931 in Oxford. Thes e Umkehr curves, as presented in the paper of Walshaw dedicated to Dobson and his work (Walshaw, 1989), are shown in Figure 22 263. 263 There is no evidence for additional Umkehr observations made in Oxford. 56 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) Figure 22: Dobson's first Umkehr observations in Ja nuary 1931 ( 4 observations from 25 -27 January ) at Oxford ( Fig- ure 6 of Walshaw, 1989). Figure 22: D obson's first U mkehr obs ervati ons in anuary (4 obser vati ons fr om 25- 27 Januar y) at O xf or d (Figure 6 of Wals haw, 1989). In 1932, Dobson and his coworker Meetham brought two newly designed Dobson instruments with photoelectric detection to Arosa to perform such Umkehr observations at the LKO and to develop the required retrieval to obtain ozone profile information (see Figure 23). One instrument was used to measure Umkehr curves, the other for total ozone (direct sun) observations. Because of unfavorable weather conditions only a few measurements could be performed in the two months of Dobson's stay in Arosa. However, after Dobson returned to Oxford with one instrument in August 1932, G\u00f6tz con- tinued to make Umkehr observations until June 1933 with the second instrument (the instrument was shipped back to Oxford in summer 1933). In total, 46 valuable Umkehr curves distributed over the whole year resulted from this campaign. Already in August 1933, the key results were published in Nature (G\u00f6tz et al., 1933a) indicating that the ozone maximum (in partial pressure) at midlatitudes was at an altitude of around 22 km above sea level and therefore much lower than previously be- lieved. The key paper on Umkehr (G\u00f6tz et al., 1934a) with the presentation of the first methods used to retrieve the ozone profile has been published based on the results of these measurements. Two methods, one developed by G\u00f6tz and the other by Dobson, have been applied for the ozone profile retrieval. In the same year ozone profile measurements determined from spectrographs on balloons were published by Regener 264 (1934) that supported the findings of G\u00f6tz et al. (1934a) 265. 264 Refer to footnote 234 on page 49. 57 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 3 1921 -1954: Period of F.

His excellent skills in instrumental design allowed him to develop the Arosa spectrograph designed on his own expertise. Thanks to his excellent scientific collaboration with Dobson, G\u00f6tz was able to use the best quality sun spectrophotometers developed in Oxford. Already in the second half of the 1920s, G\u00f6tz was an outstanding and very innovative at-mospheric physicist in the international ozone research community. Though few zenith sky data were at disposal from the Svalbard campaign he interpreted the results the right way. 265 The 50 historical Umkehr curves (Oxford and Arosa) have recently been digitalized and reprocessed with more sophisticated ret riev- al algorithms in current use (Maillard et al., 2008); 40 ozone profiles could be retrieved. Among these, 10 of them fulfilled the c onver- gence criteria which are required by the World Ozone and UV Data Center (WOUDC) in the case of the actually submitted data. T his gives an idea on the reduced quality of the Umkehr curves obtained by the photoelectric photometers (compared to the instrume nts with photomultiplier). 266 Refer to footnote 111 on page 30. 58 Scientific Repo r t MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) Because of the normally favorable climatic conditions in Arosa, the LKO served as a meas- uring platform to assess the measurements of the famous Umkehr curves suggested by the results from the Svalbard expedition in 1929 and based on the first trials in Oxford in 1931 267. Collaboration of G\u00f6tz with Meyer and the University of Z\u00fcrich 3.9 3.9.1 Collaboration with Meyer Meyer 268 had broad interests in physics (refer to Wikipedia) including atmospheric ozone. His PhD thesis was on the subject of absorption of ultraviolet light by ozone 269 and a PhD student of Meyer provided new additional laboratory measurements of ozone absorption cross sections (L\u00e4uchli, 1928). Mey er also studied measurements with the Cd -cell of the PMOD (Sect. 3.2) and he found that the measurements of the Cd -cell could be understood when a column ozone amount of around 300 DU was assumed (Meyer, 1925). G\u00f6tz maintained close contact with Meyer in all the years he was teaching at the University of Z\u00fcrich and arranged meetings between Dobson and Meyer (at the r e- quest of Dobson, 8 December 1939). Meyer refers in a letter to G\u00f6tz from 22 December 1934 to an initiative of G\u00f6tz offering to organize an ozone conference either in Z\u00fcrich or Arosa 270. Meyer argued that he would prefer to go Edinburgh as originally proposed by Dobson as a conference location (Table 5 shows that the ozone conference finally took place in Oxford in September 1936). In addi- tion to the large burden of work organizing the conference, he also pointed out serious financial prob- lems in a bid to gain financial support for the invited speakers as the Great Depression brought s e- vere economic problems during the 1930s. 3.9.2 G\u00f6tz's teaching career G\u00f6tz was teaching at the same faculty 271 as Meyer. The milestones of the teaching career of G\u00f6tz are shown in Tab 3.4 272. His teaching career started with the habilitation degree furnishing him with the title of \" Privatdozent \" (PD) 273. To obtain this degree, the habilitation thesis 274 was required, demonstrating the candidate's capability to conduct appropriate research. Furthermore, the candi- 267 It seems that after this campaign no more Umkehr measurements were performed in Arosa until 1949 when the spectrophotometer D15 equipped with a photomultiplier arrived. A request of G\u00f6tz to IAMAS (Prof. J. Bjerknes, 24 September 1949) indicates \"that Dobson hoped extended observations to be done in the favorable high altitude climate of Arosa in order to tackle again the important problem of the vertical distribution of ozone with the improved system\". Translated by the authors. Original From a letter of Perl (Sect. 4.1) of 7 November 1950 we learn that there were several days \"where the Umkehr effect was measured\". These data were apparently not analyzed nor published. 268 Refer to footnote 233 on page 49. 269 \" Die Absorption von ultraviolettem Licht in Ozon\" (Meyer , 1903). 270 Remember that G\u00f6tz had already attempted to organize the first ozone conference in Arosa in 1929 (Sect. 3.4). 271 Philosophical faculty II. 272 We acknowledge the important support of Hans -Ulrich Pfister and Verena Rothenb\u00fchler to derive the documents from the State Archives of the canton of Z\u00fcrich (Staatsarchiv des Kantons Z\u00fcrich) . 273 \"Privatdozent (PD)\" - viewed as equivalent to senior lecturer - was a common degree in German speaking universities. The qualific a- tion paves the way for appointment as full professor at (German speaking) universities and includes the right and obligation to give regular lectures at the home university (which was called \"Venia Legendi\"). 274 Habilitationsschrift. 59 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 3 1921 -1954: Period of F.

In spring 1931 G\u00f6tz obtained the degree of \" Priva tdozent \" including the \"Venia Legendi\" , which needed to be renewed regularly (see Table 6 ).

In order to obtain the habilitation, the lectures needed to be attributed to a particular field of specialization and to be integrated in the ordinary lecture program of the university. G\u00f6tz (who graduated in astronomy, see Figure 5) first approached Brunner 277 (Waldmeier, 1959). A letter of Brunner from 22 April 1930 278 explains that there was no demand for additional lectures in the field of astronomy as the number of students interested in attending such lectures at University of Z\u00fcrich as well as ETH Z \u00fc- rich was very small. Instead he suggested geophysics as a field of specialization for the habilitation. Brunner offered to discuss this with his colleague Meyer. Meyer, who was acting as dean of the fac-ulty, informed G\u00f6tz in the letter from 17 May 1930 that he and all professors concerned at the faculty supported G\u00f6tz's habilitation. However, Meyer agreed with Brunner that astrophysics would not be the appropriate discipline for habilitation but proposed cosmic physics or, better still, atmospheric 275 Probevortrag. 276 Erziehungsratsbeschluss. 277 Refer to footnote 146 on page 36. 278 L ess than one year after the Svalbard expedition of 1929, which was the basis of his habilitation thesis and published as scientific journal article (G\u00f6tz, 1931b) (see Section 3.8). 60 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmos pheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) physics with a strong emphasis on meteorology. Finally, he asked G\u00f6tz to come for a meeting t o- gether with Brunner, Wehrli 279 and himself for discussion. G\u00f6tz obviously asked Wolf 280, one of his former PhD advisors (Sect. 2.4), for advice about the field of his habilitation and Wolf agreed in his letter from 25 April 1930 with the view of Brunner, namely that G\u00f6tz should accept the possibility of obtai ning specialization in the field of cosmic physics or geophysics. In a letter from 16 July 1930, Meyer informed G\u00f6tz that the faculty could not reach an agreement about the field of specialization, implying that this question would be decided after receipt and discussion of the habilitation thesis, with the consequence that his lecture might not be included in the university's lecture list for the summer semester of 1931 (which was obviously true, see Table 7). Meyer (personal letter, 17 April 1931; as dean of the faculty, 23 February 1931) informed G\u00f6tz that the topic \"Lichthaushalt der Erde \" 281 was selected for his rehearsal talk by the faculty and that the date of the rehearsal talk was fixed for 23 April.

W. Paul G\u00f6tz In a letter of 1 May 1931 from Linke 282 we learn that G\u00f6tz was concerned that his habilitation might not be accepted by the political authority after the faculty's approval because of lack of demand for lectures. Linke tried to reassure him by saying that this would be very unlikely and that he would be willing to help but that such assistance would need to be formally requested. G\u00f6tz's habilitation was obviously accepted by the political authority on 30 April 1931 ( see Table 6 ). The lists of participants 283 (see an example in Figure 24) show that the number of students who at- tended G\u00f6tz's lectures varied between four and sixteen. However, Table 7 shows that lectures were moved in between astronomy, astronomy and meteorology as well as physics several times on the university's lecture list, suggesting that the faculty changed its opinion several times. Only after the summer seme ster of 1939, when meteorology was accepted as a minor at the University of Z\u00fcrich, did G\u00f6tz's lectures consistently appear in the category of astronomy and meteorology. In 1940, G\u00f6tz was promoted from a \" Privatdozent\" 284 to a \" Titularprofessor \" 285. As \" Titularprofessor \", he was able to act as main adviser of PhD theses (Sect. 5.1) and meteorology was introduced as a minor 286 at the University of Z\u00fcrich. The basis for this minor was a 4- semester lecture cycle of G\u00f6tz (see Table 7 ). Beginning in WS 1939/40 G\u00f6tz was teaching together with Lugeon 287 (see Table 7 ).

W. Paul G\u00f6tz G\u00f6tz was no longer capable of giving regular lectures from the spring of 1951 because of serious health problems. He became member of a student association 288 called \"Falkenstein\" 289 in order to maintain contact with young persons 290 and to overcome his isolation in Arosa. Overview of scientific achievements and cha racter of G\u00f6tz 3.10 G\u00f6tz started his extraordinary scientific production in 1925 ( Annex 2 ). In 1926, his book \"Das Strah- lungsklima von Arosa\" 291 was published (G\u00f6tz, 1926b). It shows the very broad scientific interests of G\u00f6tz and a tendency to encyclopedic comprehensiveness. The book covered sunshine duration, total solar radiation, thermal radiation, atmospheric transmission, ultraviolet solar radiation (including stud- ies of the Cd- cell, Sect. 3.2) and (stratospheric) ozone as well as the synoptic weather conditions. From the beginning, G\u00f6tz was especially interested in UV -B radiation at the surface and at different altitudes (Nicolet, 1992). However, he was not satisfied by measurement of UV -climatology. In a presentation to the Royal Institute of Public Health in May 1929 he explained his scientific approach, which clearly differed from Dorno's view (Sect. 3.2). \"From the beginning the measurements of UV light in Arosa are not only designed on a statistical basis but are also driven by the desire to under- stand the variability. The observed higher UV -levels in the autumn with respect to the spring ob- served in the series 1921 to 1924 can only be explained by the weaker ozone layer in the autumn. The variations of the ozone layer first observed quantitatively by Fabry and Buisson are essential for the comprehension of the behavior of UV radiation, which is essential for life\" 292. G\u00f6tz's most important scientific achievement was probably the discovery of the Umkehr or G\u00f6tz ef- fect based on measurements he made during his expedition to Svalbard in summer 1929 and the Umkehr measurements made at Arosa. These provided the first reliable measurements of the at-mospheric ozone profile (Sect. 3.8). G\u00f6tz was already one of the most prominent scientists in ozone research in the 1930s, remaining so until his early death, and wrote several review articles about the subject (D\u00fctsch, 1992). He was also interested from the very beginning in the study of the effect of the solar cycle on ozone (G\u00f6tz, 1926a and 1926b; see Section 3.5.1). However, G\u00f6tz was not only interested in the UV -part of but also in the visible and thermal (infrared) part of solar radiation. In addition, he studied ozone in ambient air (surface ozone, see Sections 3.5.2 and 9.1.3.2) and was convinced that ozone can be used as an indicator for air quality (G\u00f6tz, 1954; G\u00f6tz and Volz, 1951). He used first spectroscopic (long path ultraviolet spectroscopy, G\u00f6tz and Ladenburg, 1931; G\u00f6tz and Maier -Leibnitz, 1933b) before applying a chemical method in the 1950s that allowed him to obtain representative measurements (G\u00f6tz and Volz., 1951). 288 Studentenverbindung. 289 G\u00f6tz was able to become a member of \"Falkenstein\" because this student association was affiliated with the \" Studentenverbindung Wingolf \" joined by G\u00f6tz when he was a student in Germany ( Sect. 2.4; Trenkel, 1954). 290 i.e. students of the University of Z\u00fcrich when teaching in Z\u00fcrich. 291 \" Radiation climate of Arosa \".

Original text: Die Messungen Ultravioletts.\". 64 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) His productivity was outstanding (G\u00f6tz's publication list includes about 170 publications, including all types of articles, see Annex 2 ) particularly keeping in mind that (i) he made most of the measur e- ments himself and (ii) he contributed to a large variety of scientific topics. In the following we try to describe some features of the character of G\u00f6tz from studying the many documents available to us. We read many times about his humble spirit defining his personal behav-ior and character (e.g. Trenkel, 1954; D\u00fctsch, 1992). His behavior was very friendly and open but reserved in social life. Persons not familiar with atmospheric research (such as the ones living in Arosa) would never realize they were speaking with a world renowned (ozone) scientist. Waldmeier (1955) described G\u00f6tz in the following way: \"He was very busy adding scientific studies, one after another, and dedicated his life almost exclusively to science [....] everybody who came into close contact with G\u00f6tz felt that he was very happy pursuing his scienti fic studies\" 293. Even in the first years of his career, there is evidence that G\u00f6tz was strongly fighting for his point of view as shown in the controversy with Dorno in the years 1924- 1926. In several documents related to G\u00f6tz we find complaints about inappropriate support for his work (e.g. lack of assistants for analyzing the data and helping to perform measurements), or complaints that the situation of the colleagues in Davos was much better than in Arosa, etc. (Sect. 3.6.3 and 3.6.4). Apparently , he felt deprived of the support, which would be appropriate for his merits. These complaints could potentially be viewed as a consequence of his dissatisfaction that he was unable to realize part of his scientific visions and plans 294. The correspondence reveals that G\u00f6tz was not always an easy person and that he did not always behave diplomatically in his relationships. We found two letters detailing an emotional confrontation between G\u00f6tz and Carl Brandt, the owner of a photography shop in Arosa. G\u00f6tz needed a phot o- graph of a front page of a famous book for a talk and made an appointment. In the letter from 29 July 1943, G\u00f6tz mentioned that the daughter informed him that her father was at Tschuggen when he came to the shop. He immediately left, slamming the door so hard that they were afraid the glass might break. Brandt wrote in his letter from 30 July that G\u00f6tz's reaction was completely unexpected and so emotional that his wife and daughter were unable to clarify that the photographer would be back in a few minutes. Brandt also complained that G\u00f6tz immediately decided to give his work to the competing shop in Arosa and that he refused several times to greet him on the street in Arosa, al t- hough, as Brandt claimed, up to five times more hours were required than charged for G\u00f6tz's earlier assignments. Another example shows that G\u00f6tz could sometimes be very unforgiving. From a dec i- sion of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court of 28 October 1938 295 regarding matter of Albert Bouge- ant-Urien from Amiens (France) against Dr Friedrich Wilhelm Paul G\u00f6tz (Arosa) and the district office of Chur (Switzerland) we learn that G\u00f6tz was convinced that Bougeant owed him 300 CHF for the rent of an apartment at his house in Arosa. G\u00f6tz tried to obtain the money by going to the police and the district office of Chur , which decided on 11 August and 6 September 1938 to issue an arrest warrant for Bougeant. Bougeant subsequently presented a constitutional appeal at the Federal S u- 293 Waldmeier, 1954. Translated by the authors.

In the end G\u00f6tz was not able to obtain the money and probably lost much more than 300 CHF to pay the lawyer besides many hours of his time. This story shows that G\u00f6tz contained a stubborn trait indicating that he had difficulties accepting defeats. In 1958, the community of Arosa and the KVV Arosa constructed (Danuser, 1998b) a fountain to honor F. W . P. G\u00f6tz and his work 296 (see Figure 25 and for location in Arosa see Figure 1). On the fountain, we read: MeteoSwiss). 25: G\u00f6tzbrunnen (see text above) Keller MeteoSw iss). G\u00f6tz's untimely death 3.11 G\u00f6tz's health had been steadily declining since the beginning of the 1950s. Perl (refer to Section 4.1 ) was G\u00f6tz's most important collaborator from 1947 assuring the operation of the LKO during these years. G\u00f6tz's suffering is impressively described in the obituary written by Trenkel (1954). He writes that it was very difficult for G\u00f6tz to accept that he had to give up teaching at the University of Z\u00fcrich (Sect. 3.9) and he was sad he could no longer accept invitations and give presentations at interna- 296 Called \" G\u00f6tzbrunnen \" in Arosa. 297 Community and Kurverein Arosa : \"Devoted to the honorable researcher of the Climate of Arosa Prof. F.W.

His suffering from progressive arteriosclerosis, which started several years before his death, as well as physical ageing increasingly diminished his strength. According to Waldmeier (1955), G\u00f6tz was no longer capable of giving regular lectures at the University of Z\u00fcrich starting in the winter semester (WS) of 1952/53 and his name appears in the list of lectures 298 of the University of Z\u00fcrich as on leave ( beurlaubt ) up to the WS 1954/55. The 299 of Kanton Z\u00fcrich renewed the \"Venia Legendi\" on 1 September 1952 (see Table 6) 300. A letter from the Educ a- tion Department of 23 April 1953 shows that G\u00f6tz asked for leave from his lectures for the summer semester (SS) 1953 due to health problems. This was accepted and, in a letter from June 1953, we learn that G\u00f6tz was no longer expected to teach in the WS 1953/54 due to health reasons. It appears that G\u00f6tz was less and less capable of fulfilling the duties of leading the LKO starting around 1952. Because of health problems, G\u00f6tz was replaced by Perl in a meeting on 9 February 1952 in which studies by both the physics institute of the University of Fribourg (Switzerland) and the LKO relating to measurements of ions at the LKO were discussed. Perl wrote in a letter to Niggli 301 on 23 October 1952 that G\u00f6tz suffered from serious heart problems preventing him from regular work and that he had to move to G\u00f6ppingen (Germany), his mother's home town, following the advice of his doctor who suggested staying for several weeks at a lower elevation in the hope for recovery. In a letter from Perl 302 we learn that G\u00f6tz's wife (Margarete, see Appendix 1) also contributed to meteor o- logical observations at the LKO , but it seems clear that Perl was the person most deeply involved in the LKO's activities. Unfortunately, Margarete G\u00f6tz and Perl did not get along wi th each other. A commission 303 was created by the KVV Arosa to look after the problems of the LKO and to evaluate its future. In 1953, Perl asked to obtain a new contract: she was employed by G\u00f6tz (formally the LKO) but i n- sisted on being engaged directly by the KVV Arosa, an option which was supported by Grob 304 and Huber 305, whereas Ms. G\u00f6tz, assisted by Trenkel 306, wished to continue as before. In a meeting on 12 August 1953, the research council of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) 307 ap- proved, following an initiative of Huber, a substantial contribution to the salary of Perl (5,000 CHF for 3 years) under the condition that the KVV Arosa and other co- sponsors 308 continued support for the LKO. In addition, a pension 309 (Sect. 9.3) was allotted to G\u00f6tz to be paid for 6 years by the KVV Arosa. However, during these months the personal problems between Perl and Margarete G\u00f6tz were 298 Vorlesungsverzeichnis . 299 Erziehungsrat lecture Meteorology III, for the WS 1951/53 (Atmospheric Optics) was scheduled, but the Education Department (following t he suggestion of the \" Hochschulkommission\") transferred the lecture to D\u00fctsch, his earlier graduate student (Sect . 5.1) (letter of the Educ a- tion Department of 18 October 1952). 301 Paul Niggli (1888 -1953), PhD , Professor ETH Z\u00fcrich (1920 -1953). 302 To Max Sch\u00fcepp, professor at the University of Z\u00fcrich, head of research of MeteoSwiss . 303 \" Studienkommission f\u00fcr die Observatoriums Angelegenheiten \".

W. Paul G\u00f6tz escalating and Perl was no longer allowed to access the rooms of Villa Firnelicht 310 on 30 November 1953, which rendered further measurements at the location impossible. New premises therefore needed to be found rapidly to ensure the sustainability of the measurements of the LKO. In a letter from 1 December 1953, Huber instructed Perl to accelerate the search for new premises for the LKO in Arosa (already started before) mentioning that support of SNSF could not be taken as guaranteed if measurements could not be continued. At that time, the KVV Arosa was very hesitant and consi d- ered completely stopping support for the LKO, or at least asked to obtain a substantial relief of the financial burden 311. In December 1953, the Sanatorium Florentinum (a health institution held by a catholic monastic or- ganization 312 agreed (after having first refused) to offer space for the LKO including one room 313 and a cabin 314 with access to the roof (see Figure 27). Perl describes these rooms in a letter to Huber 315 : \"[The measurement instruments are] actually housed in a room in the 5th floor, [....], approximately 20 m above ground. Therefore, the influence originating from the ground should be completely di s- carded. Interference in the measurements by smoke and dust from the neighborhood is also impos-sible because the house is not surrounded by other buildings and the roof is higher than the sur-roundings trees. Furthermore, the house's furnace of the house is located in a position favorable for us\" so that the observations were not affected. This was particularly important for the measurements of the ions as well as the other chemical compounds. The Florentinum is no longer owned by the monastic organization and the available documentation provided by Markus N\u00e4pflin 316 is very sparse. In a chronicle entry of the monastery, the transport of the equipment to the Florentinum is mentioned and it appears that Perl finally needed to convince the responsible Reverend Mother to obtain ac- ceptance for making measurements at Florentinum. Considering these new facts and the obvious support of the scientific community, the KVV Arosa changed its earlier intentions and agreed to continue support for the LKO but only under the condi- tion that its support would stop after 3 years 317. This enabled continuation of the LKO Arosa meas- urements until the International Geophysical Year (IGY) 318. Based on the support of SNSF Perl ob- tained a contract from the KVV Arosa (starting retroactively on 1 November 1953). The move of the instruments to the Florentinum took place on 28- 31 December 1953 (as decided by the KVV Arosa) under the supervision of Waldmeier 319. A complete inventory of the LKO was established on this occasion. For this move all instruments and documents belonging to G\u00f6tz were excluded.

On 31 December 1953, the meteorological station was likewise moved from Villa Firnelicht to Florentinum 320. The last publication of G\u00f6tz was his book \"Klima und Wetter in Arosa\" 321. This book contains a per- sonal dedication to his mother 322. It covers a comprehensive overview of 50 years of meteorological observations in Arosa, such as temperature, humidity, the relationship between ozone and air quality, cloudiness and transport of aerosols by Saharan dust events etc. The production of the book was supported by the SNSF with 5,000 CHF (letter of SNSF secretariat, 22 July 1953). During the pr o- cess of producing the book G\u00f6tz was already seriously ill, which resulted in publication being de-layed. Both Margarete G\u00f6tz and Perl assisted in the production of this book (in addition to Honeg-ger 323). A debate took place as to whether Ms. G\u00f6tz or Perl would be responsible for the final ap- proval of the manuscript 324. Finally, Huber decided (on behalf of SNSF), that Margarete G\u00f6tz was in charge of giving final approval of the manuscript for production, arguing that the book was a private item of G\u00f6tz. This decision can be interpreted such that the weather observations were not consi d- ered a central part of the core observations supported by the KVV Arosa and Huber potentially made a pragmatic decision to overcome the obvious problems. The book was published in 1954 and the introduction shows that the book indeed appeared before G\u00f6tz's death (Sect. 3.10). G\u00f6tz died on 29 August 1954 at the age of 63 in the hospital 325 in Chur. 320 The costs of the move and the installation of the instruments at the new site (excluding move of the meteorological stati on) amount- ed to 3692 CHF, which were shared between the KVV Arosa (2/3) and the University of Fribourg (1/3, as part of the scientific project related to the measurements of atmospheric ions). 321 \" Climate and weather in Arosa\" (G\u00f6tz, 323 Hans Honegger, a former student of G\u00f6tz (proposal of thesis found in the LKO Archives), teacher at an academic high school and friend of D\u00fctsch. 324 Gut zum Druck. 325 Kreuzspital. 69 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospher ic and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 4 1954 -1962: Period of Gertrud A.

Gertrud Perl (see Figure 26; see also Korotin and Stupnicki, 2018 and Bischof, 2019) was born on 17 March 1908 in Grein, a small rural municipality by the Danube in Austria. Her parents (Augusta Perl, maiden name Bock, and Karl Franz Perl) originated from Tropau, a city belonging to the Austria-Hungarian Empire 326. The grandfather of Gertrud was director of an industrial factory producing c a- bles and wires , illustrating the higher middleclass family background. Gertrud had one older brother and two older sisters (Bischof, 2019). Her sister Edith never left Vienna, which probably also holds for her sister Ilse (at least until 1940). The family moved during World War I to Linz and later to Vien-na. After starting primary school in Linz, Perl continued primary school in Vienna. Subsequently, she continued her school education at the reformed school for girls 327, one of the academic high schools 326 Presently part of the terr itory of Czech Republic 327 Reformgymnasium 70 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) for girls in Vienna 328. She finished her general education (gymnasium level) in June 1927 with a \"M a- tura\" degree qualifying for entering University. She studied for nine semesters at University of Vienna mathematics and physics 329 and graduated with a diploma for teaching of mathematics and physics. She spent a test year for teaching at a well -known school 330 and finished her exams in January 1933. Perl submitted her PhD thesis in July 1934 331 with the title \"Zur Kenntnis der Sonnenstrahlen in verschiedenen geographischen Breiten\" 332, in 1935. The two \"referees \" (adv i- sors) accepting the PhD were Wilhelm Schmidt 333 and Gustav J\u00e4ger 334. Perl was the first female teaching assistant when subsequently employed by the University of Vienna at the professorship of physics of the Earth working until August 1938 335. After the death of Schmidt in November 1936 the contract was continued. She was not only involved in teaching, but she was continuing her scientific work as shown by the scientific publications with Steinhauser 336 (Annex 3 ). After occupation of Aus- tria by Germany in March 1938, the law of the third (German) Reich for employment in public pos i- tions (including former Austrian Universities) 337 required for all employees to be in line with the racial law of the National Socialism implying that none of their parents nor grandparents were of Jewish origin 338; this did not hold for Perl 339. The documents found by Bischof 340 show that the persons such as the new responsible Professor von Ficker 341 were able to delay the treatment of administr a- tive matters so that the contract expired for Perl finally August 1938. Bischof (2019) found a note that Perl was subsequently living in England; this was corrected by handwriting that she found a position to work as meteorologist in the Netherlands 342. Since 1939, she lived in Switzerland 343 were she continued her successful career as atmospheric scientist as she published peer -reviewed art icles. She was first employee at PMOD in Davos and continued to publish ( Annex 3 ). She was registered in Davos from 15 January 1941 until 12 March 1948 344. 328 The attendance of an excellent school underlines the high priority for education in upper middle class families. 329 Philosophische Fakult\u00e4t. 330 M\u00e4dchengymnasium Albertgasse 8 in Vienna. 331 It seems that Perl was working on her PhD thesis in parallel with applying for the qualification as teacher. 332 \" On the knowledge of solar radiation at different latitudes \".

Perl On 1 March 1948, Perl moved to the LKO (letter of M\u00f6rikofer to G\u00f6tz of 12 February 1948; see Table 20). The reason of this move is not known, but we might speculate that Perl was interested in con- tributing to the rather new area of atmospheric electricity , which G\u00f6tz was ready to start in the framework of the \"climatological action\" in collaboration with the University of Fribourg (Switzerland) (Sect. 9.1.3.c) . She stayed for training at the University of Fribourg (November 1950- May 1951). Obviously , her brother was living in Pratteln (Switzerland) at that time, since she mentioned in a letter to G\u00f6tz hav ing visited him during her training in Fribourg (Perl, 10 December 1950). It seems that she had already some health problems as she noted in a letter to G\u00f6tz that she booked a room in the Clinique Garcia obtaining suitable food for her health (Perl, 7 November 1950). Perl played a key role for continuing the measurements at LKO in the period after the death of G\u00f6tz (Sect. 4.2). For the atmospheric ozone community , the measurements of surface ozone w ere very important (Perl, 1965) 345. She had to leave Arosa for health reasons in April 1962 and continued to work at Bern with von Muralt 346 (Aroser Zeitung, 1962) , first contributing to a publication related to high altitude effects on physiology (Weihe, 1964) 347 and later as scientific collaborator in the library of the Swiss National Science Foundation 348 starting on 26 April 1964 (employment at 60%) until her death on 6 July 1974 349 . It is worth to point out (i) that graduation by PhD was exceptional for female scientists in the 1930s and (ii) we are convinced that the publication record of Perl (ten papers in reviewed literature) shows that Perl would have been capable to write a habilitation qualifying for a university. Continuation of the measurements of the LKO 4.2 Perl started the measurements at the Florentinum (see Figure 27) in early 1954. There was a delay in the continuation of total ozone observations after the move to the Florentinum (Sect. 3.11) b e- cause the galvanometer was badly damaged during transport and the repair in which Dobson was also involved (as consultant) took considerable time. A close collaboration with Dobson 350 was also established. Every ten days, Perl sent the retrieved total ozone values to Dobson. The measur e- ments of ions were continued in collaboration with the University of Fribourg including regist rations of \"fast air movements\" 351. Other measurements performed by Perl covered meteorological measur e- ments, surface ozone measurements (Perl, 1965), the intensity of solar radiation and wind registr a- tion. Measurements at Tschuggen were also continued and extended. On 19 October 1954, Saxer (later professor at the academic high school Aarau) installed an instrument for the measurement of ions at this site. 345 Her work was supported by D\u00fctsch as the author acknowledges (partial) financial support by the Office of Aerospace Research of the U.S. Air Force and thanks Prof. Dr. H.

After the death of G\u00f6tz in August 1954 (Sect. 3.11), measurements at the LKO, partially supported by SNSF 352, were continued. In the period 1953- 1956, the KVV Arosa lost interest in the LKO and at- tempted finding a new sponsor to take over its obligations . However, the situation changed when MeteoSwiss came in as an additional sponsor. The Federal Commission of Meteorology (EMK) 353 was informed by Lugeon 354 about the situation of the LKO. He was responsible for the Swiss contr i- bution to the IGY 355 and was well aware of the importance of the measurements at the LKO 356. The members of the EMK were convinced that ozone measurements at the LKO should be continued, even after the IGY, according to the protocols of the EMK meetings. The EMK decided to create an 352 A s documented by a letter of SNSF of 20 August 1953 sent to the KVV Arosa (with a copy to Perl) 353 Eidgen\u00f6ssische Meteorologische Kommission (EMK). The Federal Commission of Meteorology was an extra- parliamentary commi s- sion and existed until the early 2000's. The commission had the task to advise the Federal Council, the Federal Department of Home Affairs and MeteoSwiss on issues related to Meteorology and Climatology. 354 Refer to f ootnote 126 on page 34. 355 Refer to footnote 223 on page 45. 356 Remember that Lugeon was also teaching together with G\u00f6tz at the University Z\u00fcrich (Sect. 3.9). 73 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 4 1954 -1962: Period of Gertrud A. Perl advisory committee 357 to take care of the future of the LKO. The first meeting took place on 2 April 1958 and annual meetings were planned 358. It is not known when this committee was dissolved. In the Geophysical Year (1957/58) and in the following years, the LKO obtained substantial support (Sect. 9.3.1.a) from MeteoSwiss on initiative of Lugeon (letter of Lugeon to Perl of 23 July 1956). However, the contribution of MeteoSwiss needed annual approval preventing longer planning. For other contributions refer to Section 9.3.1. D\u00fctsch ( Sect. 5.1 and Figure 28) became more and more active at the LKO in this period. He was at that time teacher at an academic high school (Gymnasium) in Z\u00fcrich but obviously still strongly inter- ested in ozone research. He introduced Umkehr observations into the LKO's regular measuring pr o- gram in 1956. After Perl had left (because of health problems, see Section 4.1), the measurements were performed by students on their own for several months. In this critical phase, D\u00fctsch wrote a letter to the Feder-al Councillor Hans Peter Tschudi 359 on 5 June 1962 in order to find a proper long- term solution for continuing the measurements at the LKO. In the answering letter from 27 June 1962, signed by the Councillor Tschudi, it is noted that ozone measurements can be viewed as part of regular measur e- ments of meteorological institutes according to several resolutions of the WMO 360 and therefore MeteoSwiss was allowed to continue its support for the salary of the person in charge of routine measurements at the LKO (Sect. 9.3.1.a) . From the letter we also learn that the EMK decided in its meeting of 11/12 May 1962 to form a sub-committee to jointly study the problems of the observat o- ries of Davos (PMOD) and Arosa (LKO) to find the most suitable solution. The options discussed were either to make the LKO part of MeteoSwiss (the solution which was chosen later on in 1988, refer to Chapter 7) or to move the measurements of the LKO to Davos, making the LKO part of the PMOD. However, no protocol of the meeting in which these issues were discussed (23 November 1962) exists. Lugeon opined that MeteoSwiss should not assume responsibility for the ozone measurements at the LKO leading to an additional burden 361. D\u00fctsch was clearly against the move of the LKO to Davos. He argued that move's consequences would probably be moderate for total ozone 362, however, there would be a clear negative effect on the Umkehr measurements because of additional air pollution by aerosols at Davos - in addition, he argued that the total ozone series should be continued at Arosa because it was (even at that time) the longest record in the worl d 363. 357 Patronat Komitee.

Figure 28: Biography of Hans Ulrich D\u00fctsch (from Staehelin et al., 2018a) . Hans Ulrich D\u00fctsch (see Figure 28) 365 studied physics, mathematics and chemistry, including met e- orology as minor 366, at the University of Z\u00fcrich. He was inspired by G\u00f6tz's lectures 367 (Sect. 3.9). Subsequently he became a graduate student of G\u00f6tz (see Figure 29; D\u00fctsch, 1946, title The thesis was based on the chemical theo- ry of Chapman (1930) and the ozone measurements of Arosa including total ozone and profile infor- mation derived by the Umkehr method (Sect. 3.8). After extended calculations , he reached the con- clusion that the knowledge deduced from the Chapman theory was not sufficient to explain the ozone 364 For more details see L\u00e4ubli, 2019. 365 The information about the car eer of D\u00fctsch is also based on the v aluable information of D\u00fctsch, 2002, kindly provided by his chi l- dren. 366 D\u00fctsch also finished two teaching degrees for natural sciences (regular high school (Sekundarschule) , 1940) and physics (academic high school (Gymnasium), 1942), which was particularly demanding as he needed to make regular military service during World War II. 367 W e note a number of similar features in the scientific career of D\u00fctsch and G\u00f6tz, among education and experience as class room teachers. 368 \" Photochemical theory of atmospheric ozone under consideration of non- equilibrium states and air movements\".

Only four years later Brewer published his paper (Brewer, 1949) showing that transport processes are indeed relevant in the stratosphere, transporting ozone from the tropical source region into midlatitudes, which is currently known as Brewer -Dobson circulation.

These problems are illustrated in a letter (see Figure 29) where he apologizes for slow progress in his scientific work as he was simultaneously teaching at the Alpine academic high school in Zuoz in the Grisons and intermittently needed to perform military service because it was during World War II 370. After his PhD D\u00fctsch was mostly working as a teacher at the \"Oberrealschule Z\u00fcrich\", an academic high school. In 1948, he married Ursula M\u00fcller. She always supported him as when moving with the growi ng family to the United States and back to Switzerland (see below) 371. In 1950, G\u00f6tz arranged for D\u00fctsch a 9- month post -doc position at MIT in Boston in order to build contacts with the interna- tional ozone science community 372. D\u00fctsch replaced G\u00f6tz as lecturer during one semester at the University of Z\u00fcrich when G\u00f6tz was already seriously ill (Sect. 3.11). Though he could not continue to give lectures at the University of Z\u00fcrich he still was interested in ozone research (Sect. 4.2). He also started to produce weather forecasts 373 for the newspaper \"Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung\" (NZZ). Sent to a conference in Rom in 1954 by the NZZ, D\u00fctsch met Harry Wexler 374 who suggested to him to apply to the Geophysics -Research -Directorate of US Air Force to obtain the required financial support to continue the ozone observations at the LKO when it became clear that G\u00f6tz no longer was able to perform the measurements (Sect. 3.11) 375. With this contract , D\u00fctsch became involved in the anal y- sis of Umkehr measurements 376. D\u00fctsch was one of the first applying modern computers for retrieval of Umkehr profiles 377. Using the finances of the Air Force grant, D\u00fctsch organized in 1958 as well as in 1961 and 1962 important profile intercomparison campaigns (Sect. 9.1.3.g) . In 1959- 1960, he had the opportunity to spend a year with his family in Boulder CO, USA, evaluating data of the IGY at the High Altitude Observatory (HAO). In order to follow a professional career in ozone research, D\u00fctsch and his family emigrated for him taking a new position 378 in Boulder at the newly formed National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in 1962 (see Figure 28). However, he also took the full responsibility for continuation of the ozone measurements at the LKO after the departure of Perl (Sect. 4.2 and 5.2). According to D\u00fctsch (2002) he gave a lecture at ETH Z\u00fcrich about stratospheric ozone at the occ a- sion of one of his regular trips to Switzerland (required to oversee the ozone measurements at LKO, 370 From D\u00fctsch (2002) we learn that he quit his employment at the school at Zuoz in spring 1945 in order to be able to finish the very time-consuming calculations (without computer, only with side rules). 371 W e found Ursula D\u00fctsch -M\u00fcller open minded and very helpful also assisting his husband when he was travelling after his retirement . 372 D\u00fctsch claims that he found (without publication) fast (winter) stratospheric warmings (SSW: Sudden Stratospheric Warming) before (independent) discovery and publication by Scherhag (1952). 373 T he strong interests in meteorology can be viewed as another common interest with G\u00f6tz . 374 Harry Wexler (1911- 1962) was a famous meteorologist, Chief of the Scientific Services division of the US Weather Bureau (US National Weather Service) (1946 -1962) (see Wikipedia). 375 The successful grant allowed starting with the continuous Umkehr series of Arosa (Sect. 9.1.2.b, Umkehr measurements) and the study of the relationship between ozone vertical distribution and weather. 376 A nother research c ontinuing activit y of G\u00f6tz . 377 At that time, D\u00fctsch travelled regularly to Paris because the IBM 704 in Paris was the fastest computer allowing for efficient trea t- ment of the complex and time -consuming Umkehr retrieval. He continued with Carl Mateer the us e of modern computers to retrieve ozone profiles from Umkehr measurements. 378 D\u00fctsch took this decision when the Director of the \"Oberrealschule\" (Gymnasium emphasizing mathematics and science) was no longer willing to reduce the numbers of teaching lectures (as it was accepted when he took the responsibility of the Air Force grants mentioned above). 78 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) see Sect. 5.2), which was attended by ETH president Pallmann 379, and he obtained the position 380 of full professor 381 at ETH and head of the IACETH 382 in autumn 1964 383. The main science topic of D\u00fctsch was ozone research and therefore ozone measurements at the LKO were continued as part of IACETH's 384 research (Sect. 5.2). D\u00fctsch was interested both in total ozone as well as in ozone profile measurements (Sect. 4.2). Furthermore in 1966, he started ozone balloon measurements, first launched in Thalwil 385 and from 1968 onwards performed operationally by MeteoSwiss at the Aer o- logical Station in Pay erne 386. With this data, he derived ozone profile climatologies (D\u00fctsch, 1978). D\u00fctsch and coworkers compared ozone climatologies as deduced from ozonesondes launched from Boulder, CO, USA, Thalwil, Switzerland (D\u00fctsch et al., 1970), and Payerne (D\u00fctsch, 1974a). Results were first published as technical reports. Improv ing the knowledge of the circulation in the upper atmosphere (particularly at the tropopause altitude) was believed to be valuable for improvement of weather forecasts. Breiland (1964) showed that the relation between the ozone vertical distribution and synoptic meteorological conditions was a research topic in the 1960s. Publications of the observatory of Hohenpeissenberg 387 show results of careful analyses of the relations between ozonesonde measurements and synoptic weather type 388 (Hartmannsgruber, 1973; Attmannspacher and Hartmannsgruber, 1973 and 1975). D\u00fctsch justified the ozone measurements of the LKO with atmospheric physics research as written in a letter on 19 September 1961 389 to Vaterla us 390. The letter starts by referring to the Ozone symposium that took place in August 1961 in Arosa and then specifies: \"Ozone is a tracer to study [vertical] stratospheric air movement that cannot be directly measured and important results are expected regarding unr e- solved problems of stratospheric circulation (from small to largest scales). This gas is not only a trac-er for such movements but actively contributes to them [...] for such reasons activities in ozone measurement have strongly increased over the last decade and significant progress has been achieved regarding determination of the vertical distribution of this trace gas 391.

The letter ends with the statement that such analyses are considered to be important for reliable long- term meteorological weather prediction. This letter can also be viewed as a case for supporting Umkehr measurements. Besides ozone research, D\u00fctsch was strongly and continuously interested in (synoptic) meteorology and meteorological weather forecast. For 51 years he produced weather forecasts for the famous newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung (NZZ, 9 January 2001), a task he continued more than 15 years after his retirement as professor of ETH Z\u00fcrich. At the beginning of the 1970s, a paradigm change took place in stratospheric ozone research. The study of the effect of anthropogenic emissions in the lower stratosphere was a new topic that r e- ceived very high priority (e.g. Staehelin et al., 2016). First the effect of anthropogenic nitrogen emi s- sions from civil aircraft planned to operate with supersonic speed 392 were discussed (Johnston, 1971 and Crutzen, 1970). Only a few years later, Stolarski and Cicerone (1974) and independently Molina and Rowland (1974) found that ClO x can destroy stratospheric ozone; the latter postulated chlor o- fluorocarbons as source gas of ClO x 393.

Sherwood Rowland f or their work in atmos- pheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone. 80 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) D\u00fctsch was one of the leading scientists in stratospheric ozone research and one of the few ozone experts involved in ozone research both in the time before anthropogenic ozone destruction was debated and in the decades when ozone destruction by ozone depleting substances (ODS, such as chlorofluorocarbons) was in the focus of stratospheric ozone research. He contributed to the IO 3C 394, serving as member from 1957 to 1975, as secretary for 15 years (1959 -1975), before being elected as president in the period 1975- 80. In 1988, he was awarded as an honorary member of the IO3C. He was also the main organizer of two important ozone symposia (Quadrennial Ozone Symposium (QOS), organized for the IO 3C) that were held in Arosa in 1961 (with 75 participants) and 1972 (with 90 participants) 395 (Bojkov, 2012). These symposia took place in the Protestant church parish hall of Arosa (see Figure 30). In the QOS of 1972 in Arosa, the topic of anthropogenic ozone depletion was new in the community. The quantification of the effect of anthropogenic emissions required the development of numerical simulations , which were becoming more and more sophisticated over time (refer to Section 6.1). During the 1970s, many features of state- of-the-art stratospheric knowledge needed to be devel- oped. The theory of Molina and Rowland (1974), i.e. the destruction of the ozone layer by manmade chlorofluorocarbons releasing ClO x radicals in the upper stratosphere, was questioned by the chem i- cal industry that supported additional research. Furthermore, satellite instruments were launched to monitor the ozone layer from space. D\u00fctsch provided valuable information for the community, e.g., to assess numerical simulations de- scribing anthropogenic ozone depletion with ozone climatologies (D\u00fctsch 1974b; D\u00fctsch, 1978). For more information on D\u00fctsch's publications see Annex 4 396. Toward the end of his career several employees in his group were involved in air pollution research ( e.g., Graber, 1984). Very high data quality and reliability (see Sect. 6.1) in the ground- based total ozone measurements also became a political issue. Du Pont, the market leader in production of chlorofluorocarbons in the 1970s made an advertisement in New York Times, 1975: \"Should reputable evidence show that some fluorocarbons cause health hazard through depletion of the ozone layer, we are prepared to stop production of the offending compounds\". Indeed, negative long- term ozone trends were viewed as \"reputable evidence\" for stratospheric ozone destruction by chlorofluorocarbons. Note, that long-term calibration stability of ground- based instruments need to be very high since anthropogenically caused long- term trends in stratospheric ozone at midlatitudes are in the order of several percent change per decade whereas day to day variability of ozone can be as large as \u00b1 20% (Sect. 6.1 and 7.5). 394 Refer to footnote 121 on page 33 . 395 In 1972, Arosa was chosen as symposium venue allowing to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the LKO and to honor its founder F. W. Paul G\u00f6tz. 396 D\u00fctsch was the main advisor of several PhD theses relevant in this context: Piaget (1970) studied stratospheric intrusions, Z \u00fcllig (1973, 1975) looked at the relation between the intensity of stratospheric polar vortex and the ozone content of the winter hemisphere; the PhD thesis of Birrer (1975a and b) focused on the homogeneity of the total ozone record at Arosa, whereas that of Braun ( 1980) was devoted to studying the effect of stratospheric warmings on ozone at mid latitudes (see also Table 16 in Sect. 9.2.3). 81 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Cli matic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 5 1962 -1985: Period of Hans Ulrich D\u00fctsch Measurements at the LKO 1962-1973 5.2 When Perl had to leave Arosa in 1962, D\u00fctsch assumed scientific leadership of the LKO (Sect. 4.2). At the same time, he went to Boulder (NCAR) to pursue research in the field of atmospheric ozone. Honegger 397 was helping to manage the program of measurements at the LKO during the leave of D\u00fctsch (1962- 1964, see Sect. 5.1). D\u00fctsch defined program\" covering the fol- lowing measurements: ( i) routine observation of total ozone; (ii) measurements of atmospheric elec- tricity; (iii) continuation of climatological measurements 398; (iv) ozone profile measurements by the Umkehr method. Several Dobson spectrophotometers were in use at the LKO during the D\u00fctsch period 399. Five total ozone measurements per day were submitted to Toronto for publication by WMO starting in 1962; they were also published in the annals of MeteoSwiss 400 in 1961 and in the following years. The observations were now performed by a technician 401 who acted as station manager (for more information refer to Section 9.2.1.a) . The KVV Arosa still continued to support the LKO and the st a- tion manager received his salary from the KVV Arosa for 10 years. Measurements at the roof of the Florentinum were difficult because the space was limited. As the nurse working at night in the sanatorium had her sleeping room at the same floor, some problems with noise complicated work as well. A letter from 13 April 1967 provided by N\u00e4pflin 402 from the documentation of the monastery I n- genbohl signed by Grob 403 and the Reverend Mother in charge of the Florentinum describes a new regulation for the rooms of the LKO at the Florentinum. As 3 rooms were now available, the monthly rent was increased and other organizational details were discussed that obviously needed clarific a- tion. D\u00fctsch used the statistical Langley plot method 404 to update the instrumental constants; this requires a large number of measurements at different sun elevations (D\u00fctsch, 1984). The observer therefore had to make measurements over the entire day looking for the required weather conditions as only direct sun observations (at different wavelength pairs, refer to Staehelin et al., 1998a) were per-formed for total ozone measurements at Arosa. To ensure the highest data quality D\u00fctsch applied the statistical Langley plot calibration every year to check and updat e the instrumental constants of the Dobson instruments operated at the LKO Arosa (D\u00fctsch, 1984). For this purpose, D\u00fctsch went to Arosa every year for several days or even weeks and checked all total ozone measurements before deriving updates from the instrumental constants , which also were applied backwards for every year (see Sect. 7.5) leading to small changes in each total ozone value. 397 Refer to footnot e 323 on page 68. 398 Observations of the climatological station of MeteoSw iss. 399 F or more information concerning measurements and instruments refer to Section 9.1.2. 400 Annalen der Meteorologischen Zentralanstalt (today MeteoSwiss). 401 The employment of the technician was based on the letter of the Councillor Tschudi of 27 June 1962 (Sect. 4.2) in which ozone measurements were viewed as part of the duties of a Meteorological Office. 402 Refer to footnote 316 on page 67. 403 Refer to footnote 304 on page 66. 404 The statistical Langley plot method is described in Section 7.5. 82 Scientific Report Mete oSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) Move of the LKO to the Haus St einbruch and first Dobson inte r- 5.3 comparison at Arosa According to a document from N\u00e4pflin 405, the LKO was forced to leave the Florentinum by the end of 1972 with the justification that the rooms used by the LKO were needed for the employees of the Florenti num. The measurements were moved from the roof of the sanatorium Florentinum to the roof of another building nearby, the \"Haus zum Steinbruch\" 406 (see Figure 1 for location and Figure 31), at the beginning of 1973. On that occasion, the local station manager (Aeschbacher 407 at that time) became an employee of IACETH. The new place offered much better working and measuring cond i- tions (see legend of Figure 31); however, the running costs were considerably higher (Sect. 9.3.1). The rent for the new measuring platform as well as for the related apartments was also paid by ETH Z\u00fcrich through the Federal Off ice for Buildings and Logistics 408. One apartment was reserved for the station manager and his family, the other one for external people working at the LKO or visitors (see legend of Figure 31).

In 1978, such an intercomparison organized by D\u00fctsch was held in Arosa. It was one of the first international Dobson intercomparison exercises and the results were debatable 410 (for more information refer to Staehelin et al., 1998a; Basher, 1995). They were not applied to the Arosa record and D\u00fctsch continued to use the statistical Langley plot method 411 for the update of the instrumental constants of D15 until it was replaced by D101 412 as the main instrument at the LKO Arosa (Sect. 9.1.2.b) . 409 Dobson Spectrophotometer D83. 410 It turned out that a debate took place which of the instruments should be used as standard instrument (Basher, 1995). 411 The statistical Langley plot method is described in Section 7.5. 412 Refer to footnote 227 on page 47 . 84 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) 85 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 6 1985 -1988: Period of re -orientation 6 1985-1988: Period of re -orientation Arosa measurements and I nternational Ozone Trend Panel Report 6.1 Around 1984- 85, the global stratospheric ozone problem appeared to be much less severe than believed in the late 1970s. Global models are required to quantify the effect of ODS emission on stratospheric ozone. In 1974, only 1- dimensional models were available, which were continuously improved. Furthermore, stratospheric ozone chemistry involves dozens of chemical species connec t- ed via many chemical reac tions 413. Chemical ozone depletion (in the gas phase) is limited by the formation of key reservoir species such as ClONO 2 staying in a chemical equilibrium with ClO and NO 2, both of them destroy ozone. However, in the publication of Rowland and Molina in 1975 the reaction rate of the formation of ClONO 2 could only be estimated from laboratory measurements made at physical conditions (temperature and pressure) very different from the stratosphere. Begi n- ning in the second part of the 1970s, key reaction rate constants were measured (often supported by the chemical industry) for physical conditions m ore typical of the stratosphere 414. This caused very large changes (see Figure 32 ) in the global ozone destruction projected to be reached after 50 to 100 years (i.e. after reaching steady state) assuming always the same emissions of ODS, namely those of the 1970s. The first numerical results for 1974 described in Rowland and Molina (1975) 415 indicate a global ozone decrease of 15%; the largest ozone depletion by ODS was expected to be 19% in 1979, whereas the ozone decline was predicted to be only about 3% in 1983. This result suggested that anthropogenic ozone depletion would become only a serious environmental problem in case of continuous increase in worldwide ODS emission. On the political side, the international discussion on anthropogenic ozone depletion resulted in the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone layer in 1985 416. However, the Vienna Conven- tion did not contain any formal commitment for emission reductions of individual countries. The view of the stratospheric ozone depletion changed dramatically in the second part of the 1980s. The Antarctic Ozone hole was detected in 1985 (Farman et al., 1985), a phenomenon which was completely unexpected. Farman et al. (1985) speculated in their paper that the Antarctic ozone hole could be caused by increasing emission of CFCs; however, this explanation was speculative at this time and strongly questioned. This led to large aircraft campaigns and within a few years it became clear that the rapid Antarctic ozone depletion was caused by manmade emissions of ODS (Rowland, 1991; Peter, 1997; Solomon, 1999). 413 State -of-the-art stratospheric chemistry models include more than hundred compounds. 414 Reliable determination of such reaction rate constants needs special expertise and equipment. 415 Refe r to footnote 393 on page 79. 416 The treaty of the Vienna Convention came into force on 22 March 1985 when signed by more than 20 countries. 86 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) Figure 32: Prediction of decrease in global stratospheric Ozone (see text) (from Benedick, 1991, p. 13). Figure 32: Predicti on of decr eas e i n global str at ospheric Oz one (see t ext) (from B enedic k, 1991, p. 13). The change in the assessment of the ozone layer threat was also the result of the report from the International Ozone Trends Panel (IOTP, 1988, chaired by Robert T. Watson) documenting signif i- cant ozone reduction in the more populated (northern) midlatitudes. Continuous ozone satellite ob- servations by the instruments TOMS and SBUV on board the Nimbus 7 satellite started in 1979 (e.g. Staehelin et al., 2001). The first trend analyses of the (relatively) short TOMS record suggested a strong decrease in total ozone in northern midlatitudes (Heath, 1988). These findings started a de-bate, since the ground- based total ozone measurements did not confirm the large decrease reported from the satellite measurements. In the IOTP (1988) (among other topics) satellite and gr ound- based measurements were reviewed. The IOTP (1988) reached the conclusion that ground- based meas- urements were more reliable concerning the long- term stability, while satellite data provide global coverage. The lack of long- term stability of the satellite calibration was caused by inappropriate de- scription of the degradation of the diffuser plate radiance reference 417. Chapter 4 of Vol. I of the IOTP (1988) 418 contains a comparison between ground- based Dobson and TOMS overpass measurements. The quality of most of the ground- based total ozone data available at the World Ozone Data Center (WODC) 419 was not sufficient for reliable trend analysis and TOMS data 420 were used as transfer standards in order to detect sudden changes in ground- based meas- urements attributed to calibration problems in the Dobson data. Only the Arosa total ozone data were 417 A fter the publication of IOTP (1988) , the TOMS and SBUV -satellite data sets were treated by a new retrieval algorithm making use of measurements at different wavelengths overcoming the problem of diffuser plate degradation (Hermann et al., 1991) . This led to the TOMS/SBUV version 7 ( e.g. Stolarski et al., 1992 ) and more recently version 8 series (Bhartia et al. , 2004 ). 418 Entitled \"Trends in Total Column Ozone Measurements \" (chaired by F. S. Rowland). 419 P resently World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Center (WOUDC) operated by Environment and Climate Change Canada at Toronto. 420 Satellite measurements are called overpass data when matching best individual ground -based ozone measurements regarding space and time. 87 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 6 1985 -1988: Period of re -orientation used as provided by D\u00fctsch.

Figure 33: Annual means of t he t ot al ozone s eries of Ar os a (Chart R en\u00e9 St \u00fcbi MeteoS wiss). The results of trend analysis of ground- based total ozone measurements presented in IOTP 423 can be found in the PhD thesis of Harris (1989) 424, which was performed under the supervision of Row- land 425. Harris developed a statistical time series model accounting for seasonal variation and includ- ing a long- term trend component depending on calendar month 426. Other terms described the noise and were used for determining uncertainties of trend magnitude. Furthermore, the model included three proxies (or explanatory variables) for the description of natural variability such as the Quasi 421 Rumen Bojkov, PhD, Former Special Advisor to the Secretary -General of WMO on Ozone and Global Environmental Issues and Secretary of IO 3C (1984 -2000). 422 The data provided by Bojkov were named \"provisionally revised data\". 423 In the IOTP, 27 Dobson records of sufficient length of the northern hemisphere (most of them located in midlatitudes, 11 sites with measurements that went back to the 1950s) were available whereas there were only 4 suitable records from the southern hemisphere. A debate evolved around the \"provisionally revised data\" , as in urban areas, tropospheric SO 2 can significantly deteriorate O 3 column measurements of Dobson instruments. Therefore, c hanges in local SO 2 pollution can lead to false ozone trends in Dobson series as documented in the total ozone series of Uccle, a station close to Brussels (De Muer and De Backer, 1992 ). 424 The thesis of Harris contains a comprehensive overview of earlier studies of trend analyses of total ozone that did not show signifi- cant trend s (e.g. Reinsel et al., 1981). Harris (1989) used two approaches to deduce and confirm significant negative winter ozone long- term trends at northern midlatitude stations. In the simple approach, he compared monthly mean values of two approximately equal periods of the individual station data with measurements starting in 1965 and ending in 1985 finding in most cases lower winter ozone values for the measurements 1970 -1985 than the earlier data. 425 Refer to footnote 393 on page 79. 426 The trends were assumed to start at the beginning of 1970 (using a ramp function) , but the selection of the exact year did not signif i- cantly change the conclusion. 88 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospher ic and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) Biennial Oscillation, the 11- year sunspot cycle and a term derived from numerical simulations to describe the effect of nuclear bomb tests 427. Harris (1989) was the first to show negative winter downward trends in northern midlatitudes. Harris (1989) 428 used two versions of the Arosa data. Data based on AD -double wavelength 429 (Sect. 3.7.1) observations were used for trend analysis of total ozone measurements after the IGY. In addition, he also utilized the C -wavelength pair measurements of Arosa (Staehelin et al., 1998a) , which were available from 1931 430. Arosa is located at an alpine site where the effect of aerosols is expected to be very small and therefore the trends of the two data sets were similar. The Arosa series (see Figure 33) played a key role in the IOTP 1988 (and the thesis of Harris) be- cause (a) it was the only series that did not need correction by TOMS overpass data 431 and because (b) of its unique length. DuPont, the market leader in ODS production, during the 1970s strongly opposed to a limitation of ODS chemical production (Sect. 5.1), rather suddenly changed its position supporting global regul a- tion in 1986 (Grundmann, 1999, p. 257 ff.). DuPont was probably afraid of being confronted with compensation claims due to skin cancer: in a study of EPA of 1986 800,000 \"additional\" deaths from skin cancer within the coming 88 years were projected and therefore documentation of negative ozone trends at midlatitudes might have been important in the decision of the DuPont company to stop production of chlorofluorocarbons as significant ozone decrease might have been viewed as \"reputable evidence\" ( Sect. 5.1). The same type of statistical model was used in the WMO/UNEP Ozone Assessments (Sect. 7.1), with the only difference that the proxy of nuclear bomb tests used by Harris was ignored in the later studies. Measurements at the LKO ( 1985-1988) 6.2 When D\u00fctsch retired in 1985, measurements at the LKO were at first continued as described in 5.2. The second international Dobson intercomparison at Arosa took place in 1986, organized by D\u00fctsch on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization. One of the Dobson instruments used at Arosa 432 (D101) was recalibrated by comparison with the world primary Dobson instrument (D83, see Sect. 7.5) whereas the instrumental constants of the other Dobson instrument (D15) were not changed (Sect. 7.4.1). 427 The nuclear bomb tests mainly occurred in the first half of the 1960s and might have caused stratospheric ozone depletion b y re- lease of nitrogen oxides. 428 Harris (1989) compared the results of long -term trend analysis with the results of a (2- dimensional) numerical simulation. The numer- ical models also showed downward trends strongest in winter, however, much smaller than those obtained by the statistical analysis. Harris (1989) argued that the numerical simulations did not contain heterogeneous chemical reactions. 429 Remember that AD measurements allow the effects of aerosols to be minimized and were introduced in the Dobson network in IGY (see Figure 15 ). Reliable C and AD data is available only at Arosa. 430 After homogenization of the earliest measurements ( Birrer, 1975a and b). 431 Refer to footnote 420 on page 86. 432 Refer to footnote 227 on page 47. 89 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich ) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 6 1985 -1988: Period of re -orientation Search for a solution to continue observations at the LKO 6.3 Upon the retirement of D\u00fctsch in 1985, the continuation of long- term stratospheric ozone measur e- ments at Arosa (namely total ozone and Umkehr) was uncertain as the new Professor and new D i- rector of IACETH 433 succeeding to D\u00fctsch had other research priorities and was not interested in atmospheric ozone research. Bruno Hoegger 434 played an important role in finding a proper solution. D\u00fctsch, Rieker 435 and Hoegger participated in a meeting on 25 June 1985 at Payerne 436 to discuss the ozonesondes launched at Payerne, where also an inspection of the Dobson instruments at Arosa was planned for spring 1986. At a meeting of Richner (IACETH), Rieker and Hoegger in Payerne on 10 January 1986, the future of the ozone measurements at Arosa was discussed when it was clear that neither IACETH nor the Geographic Institute of ETH Z\u00fcrich 437 were willing to continue the meas- urements 438. In the minutes (written by Hoegger) it was suggested to ask the PMOD in Davos to continue the LKO measurements as trained personnel suitable for this task would be available. Fur-thermore, MeteoSwiss argued that it was not useful to perform the ozonesonde measurements and to take over the responsibility of the ozone observations in Arosa without a qualified scientist in Swit-zerland responsible for scientific analysis and i nterpretation of the ozone data 439 since the scientific research based on the measurements was believed to be very important for data quality. It was also argued that this problem could not be solved by hiring a research scientist at MeteoSwiss because a long- term commitment for such a scientist was required, which was not possible for MeteoSwiss as no permanent position was available and it was deemed inappropriate to hire a qualified scientist on a non- permanent position. D\u00fctsch took 440 the initiative by writing a letter to the responsible Federal Councillor Cotti 441. Based on this letter the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment 442 was charged to analyze the situation of the ozone activities in Switzerland. The Office came to the conclusion that Swiss research in s trato- spheric as well as tropospheric ozone needed to be continued because the scientific expertise in stratospheric as well tropospheric ozone was required to support decisions related to international cooperation such as the Vienna Convention 443 (Sect. 6.1). This led to a request from B\u00f6hlen 444 of the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to Oeschger 445 to coordinate the evaluation of the f u- 433 Refer to footnote 12 on page 4. 434 Bruno Hoegger, PhD, responsible of the Measurement Technics of MeteoSwiss at the Aerologic al Station in Pa yerne (1984 -2002) (Sect. 9.2.2.b) , retired in 2002. 435 Jean Rieker, PhD, responsible of the Upper Air Measurements of MeteoSwiss at the Aerological Station in Payerne 436 Minutes available at the Aerological Station of Payerne. 437 Atsumu Ohmura, PhD, Professor (Emeritus) of Physical Geography at the Geographic Institute of ETH Z\u00fcrich (1983 -2001) and IACETH (2001 -2007). 438 ETH Z\u00fcrich argued that regular oz one measurements routinely performed at the LKO do not fall under the responsibility of a u niver- sity. 439 As it was the case at the time when D\u00fctsch was working as scientist at ETH Z\u00fcrich. 440 As in the first phase of uncertainty concerning the continuation of the LKO after the death of G\u00f6tz (Sect. 3.11 and 4.2). 441 Flavio Cotti, Swiss Federal Councillor (1986- 1999), Head of the Swiss Federal Department of Home Affairs in Bern (Vorsteher des (BUS) (1971 -1989). 443 Refer to footnote 416 on page 85. 444 Bruno B\u00f6hlen (1930- 2011), PhD, professor at the ETH Z\u00fcrich, Director of the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (1985- 1992). 445 Hans Oeschger (1927- 1998), PhD , Professor of Climate and Environmental Physics at the Physics Institute of the University of Bern (1963 -1992) , chairmen of the Commission for Climate and Atmosphere (CCA) (Kommission f\u00fcr Klima und Atmosph\u00e4re), a commission of the of Sciences (Schweizerische Akademie der Naturwissenschaften SCNAT) . 90 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) ture of ozone research in Switzerland, leading to an expert meeting on 27 May 1986 with the partic i- pation of the interested administrative bodies and the Swiss scientists active in ozone research in order to make a valuable proposal to find a solid basis for the continuation of the Swiss ozone meas-urements in Arosa (and Payerne). Different institutional options and various locations were analyzed to host the measurements. At that time, the move of the LKO to Davos was also considered. Finally, the evaluation ended in the following arrangement. On 12 March 1987, Primault 446 submitted a request to the management board of MeteoSwiss to take over the measurements of the LKO in which the budget for operations and investments for renewal of the station was included. The man-agement board of MeteoSwiss, under the direction of Junod 447, agreed to continue the ozone sound- ings by MeteoSwiss at the Aerological Station in Payerne and to take the responsibility for regular performance of the ozone measurements of the LKO in Arosa (total ozone and Umkehr). The D e- partment of Home Affairs approved that the number of permanent positions at MeteoSwiss could increase by one personal unit 448 allowing moving the observer (station manager) of the LKO (occ u- pied by Aeschbacher 449) to MeteoSwiss 450; MeteoSwiss obtained the new position by 1 January 1988 and the LKO 451 was integrated into MeteoSwiss 452. At the same time, the former position of th e observer of the LKO at IACETH 453 was converted into a scientific position in order to continue (among other tasks) the scientific support of the Swiss ozone measure ments 454. 446 Bernard Primault, PhD, head of the Measurement and Data department of MeteoSwiss (Bereich Messungen und Daten) (1983 - physicist, Director of MeteoSwiss (1983- 1992). 448 Despite a hiring freeze existing in the federal administration. 449 Refer to footnote 103 on page 29. 450 Confirmed by the letter of 2 July 1987 of the responsible Federal Department of Home Affairs (Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Departement des Innern) to the Director of MeteoSwiss. 451 At that occasion a change of the official name of the LKO was introduced: Light Climatic Observatory - Ozone Measuring Station of MeteoSwiss (Lichtklimatisches Observatorium - Ozonmessstation der MeteoSchweiz abbreviated LKO, as previously). 452 The LKO was becoming part of the Aerological Station of Payerne and integrated into the division in charge of the Upper Air meas- urements of MeteoSwiss (for the responsible persons refer to Table 14 in Section 9.2.2.a) which was also operating the measurements of the ozonesondes at Payerne. Technical aspects (renewal and maintenance of the instrumentation) fall under the responsibility of the Measurement Techniques division of Payerne (for the responsible persons refer to Table 15 in Section 9.2.2.b) . 453 Refer to footnote 12 on page 4. 454 By 15 April 1988, Johannes Staehelin (one of the authors of the report) started his position at IACETH taking care (among other duties) of the scientific activities related to the ozone measurements and being data quality advisor for the ozone measurements of MeteoSwiss. 91 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 7 1988 -2014: Period of MeteoSwiss and IACETH 7 1988-2014: Period of MeteoSwiss and IACETH International development 7.1 The Montreal Protocol (MP) 455 is justifiably viewed as a milestone in the global environmental regul a- tion allowing for legally binding reduction of the anthropogenic emissions of ODS. The MP was sub- sequently strengthened several times (see Figure 34) and strongly dominated the agenda in ozone research in the following decades. Figure 34: Montreal Protocol and its strengthenings.

The atmospheric loading of ozone depleting substances is often described by the metric \"Equivalent Effective Stratospheric Chlorine\". Its evolution is shown in Figure 34. The peak loading was reached 455 The Montreal Protocol (MP) was prepared on 16 September 1987 by the parties of the Vienna Convention and went into force on 1 January 1988 . 92 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) in the second half of the 1990s. Stratospheric ozone measurements were therefore required to doc- ument the \"turn- around\" of the negative stratospheric ozone trends and the expected subsequent recovery. Documenting the recovery of the ozone layer is also viewed as an important task as the aim of the MP is the protection of the global ozone layer (Sect. 8.1) 456. Collaboration between MeteoSwiss and IACETH 7.2 The following partnership between MeteoSwiss and IACETH was established in the subsequent period of measurements at the LKO. MeteoSwiss was in charge of the operational performance of the ozone measurements whereas IACETH was mainly responsible for scientific analysis of the measurements and contributing to data quality assurance and control (QA/QC) (Sect. 7.5). In this cooperation, it was attempted to make best use of the different strengths of the two types of instit u- tions. MeteoSwiss has (i) the required budget and technical capability for renewal of the equipment (see below) and (ii) the possibility to hire professionally trained personnel in permanent positions necessary for high quality measurements. These two requirements can hardly be fulfilled by univers i- ties today. Conversely, the strength of a un iversity such IACETH is scientific research , which benefits from the analysis of the Swiss ozone measurements. Research at universities is strongly based on the work of PhD students , which requires publishing papers in peer reviewed literature. This in tur n requires an element of new innovative research. The PhD advisor has the duty to provide the PhD candidate with a research topic allowing completion of the PhD thesis within about three years and to discuss with the student the progress of his/her research. By this cooperation, the Swiss long- term ozone measurements were analyzed and published in the reviewed literature, which assured the scientific use of these data and enhanced the visibility of the measurements performed by Meteo - Swiss. The close cooperation between MeteoSwiss and IACETH also helped strengthen the motiv a- tion of the MeteoSwiss employees performing the operational measurements , which can be viewed as an important element in QA/QC since very high data quality data is required as a basis for re- search published in the reviewed literature. At the beginning 457 of the working relationship between MeteoSwiss and IACETH, the roles needed to be defined including an adequate interface. Measurements at the LKO (1988-2014) 7.3 Dobson instruments were previously located on trolleys (see Figure 36). During night and adverse weather conditions (precipitation) they were located in a hut and needed to be positioned in a proper way for measurements. Instrument readings were written by hand on paper sheets and the total ozone values were subsequently calculated 458. 456 The relevant scientific results were subsequently summarized within three to four years in the WMO/UNEP Ozone Assessments that were produced for the states that signed the MP. 457 Refer to footnote 14 on page 4. 458 A PhD student under D\u00fctsch started in the 1970s to automate a Dobson spectrophotometer for total ozone observation, however, the work was not successfully completed (refer to Section 9.1.2.b Total Ozone observations for more details). 93 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmosphe ric ozone measurements 7 1988 -2014: Period of MeteoSwiss and IACETH Figure 35: Hans Ulrich (on the left) together with Bruno Hoegger (MeteoSwiss) , who was responsible for the renewal of the LKO in 1987 -1989, staying in front of the hut in which the automated Dobson instrument (D51) was located for the Umkehr observations (Photo Bruno Hoegger).

A spectrodome was constructed (see Figure 37) in which the two Dobson instruments were located. At the roof, a window could be opened for measurements and the spectrodome could be rotated for proper position of total ozone (direct sun) measurements. Furthermore, the position of the wedge of the instruments providing the instrument's signal was recorded electronically and the signal transferred electronically to the PCs inside the building, enabling much easier and more reli a- ble operation of the Dobson spectrophotometers (Hoegger et al., 1992). PC -programs were written to derive total ozone amount and graphics were developed, e.g., to compare the individual total ozone values of the two Dobson instruments (e.g. for one day) allowing easy detection of suspicious data.

At the same time, one Dobson instrument was completely automated for the Umkehr measur e- ments 460 and placed in a special hut (visible in Figure 35).

On the other hand, M\u00fcller 462 and Rieker were focused to restructure the organization and to define new operational procedures 463. The students were replaced by part -time auxiliary staff (more details can be found in Section 9.2.1.a) . Three large Dobson intercomparisons (Sect. 7.5) took place in 1990, 1995 and 1999 in Arosa (invol v- ing 10- 15 instruments, see Figure 38). After 2000, smaller Dobson intercomparisons were organized, normally in Hohenpeissenberg. Nevertheless, important intercomparison campaigns continued to be organized in Arosa, such as a regional Dobson intercomparison in 2003 (including 6 Dobson instr u- ments), and the LKO specific intercomparisons in 2006 and 2010 (with 4 Dobson instruments). Figure 38: Dobson intercomparison at the roof of the Haus Steinbruch (Photo Bob Evans , formerly NOAA, Boulder ). Figure 38: D obson i nt ercomparis on at t he roof of t he Haus St ei nbr uch (P hoto B ob E vans, for merl y NO A A, Boul der). Additionally, the first Brewer workshop was held at Arosa in 1990. Brewer Regional Calibration cam- paigns were carried out in 2008, 2006; maintenance/calibration campaigns with the European Brewer Calib ration Center (RBCC -E) traveling reference instrument have taken place in 2012, 2014 and 2016 (St\u00fcbi et al., 2017a). Scientific meetings during the Dobson and Brewer intercomparisons were held in the meeting room of the Catholic Church community of Arosa. 462 Gerhard M\u00fcller, former acting Director of MeteoSwiss (2010- 2011), Deputy Director (1998 -2011), Head of the Measurement and Data department (1987- 2012), retired in 2012. 463 As documented by a series of notes found in the archives. 96 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) In November 2001, Aeschbacher 464, the local station manager, retired. Before a replacement was decided, Viatte 465 produced a strategy paper requested by the management board of MeteoSwiss to review the situation of the observatory with the aim of analyzing if the LKO was on the right track and if operation could be optimized. Once again, the question of a merger with the PMOD in Davos was a topic of discussion. As the expected recovery of the ozone layer due to a diminished loading of ozone depleting substances in the atmosphere was not yet confirmed in the data it was concluded that it was not the moment to endanger the long total ozone measurement series and that a rapid move to another place was not possible but would require a good preparation with an extended per i- od of parallel measurements (Sect. 8.2). In 2002, the astrophysical observatory (Sect. 3.5.1; see Figure 39), which had been built by ETH Z\u00fcrich in 1938 at Tschuggen near G\u00f6tz's hut was closed. MeteoSwiss was asked if there would be some interest to take over the building for the purpose of the LKO. The possibility to use it as new LKO measurement platform was envisaged and the scientific as well as the technical and financial aspects were evaluated. However, the idea was ultimately abandoned.

The careful inspection of the instrument in sum- mer 1992 indicated that the standard Dobson instrument used between 1949 and 1992 (D15) was not operated in proper optical alignment (Sect. 9.1.2.b) . D\u00fctsch regularly applied the statistical Lang- ley plot 467 method to correct small changes in the instrumental constants (Sect. 5.2 and 7.5) for d e- termination of total ozone (Staehelin et al., 1998a). The correspondence of G\u00f6tz with Dobson shows (Staehelin et al., 1998a) that G\u00f6tz was never satisfied with the performance of the new instrument D15 when operated at the LKO and results of comparisons of measurements between the old F\u00e9ry Spectrophotometer (\"D2\") and D15 from April -June 1950 showed pronounced differences (see Fi g- ure 3 in Staehelin et al., 1998a). This provided evidence that D15 was always operated in optical misalignment, but most probably in stable condition as D\u00fctsch always used the statistical Langley plot correction. The instrument was carefully inspected several times , but no particular problem in D15 was found; in one report we found the remark that everything on D15 was tested except the optical alignment because of a lack of suitable instrumentation (Staehelin et al., 1998a). Figure 40 shows the results of the calibration of instruments performed in Oxford in the late 1940s including those of D15. The remarkable difference of D15 against the standard instrument (\"D1\") (see data around 09.50) provides independent evidence that D15 had an instrumental problem before being transported to Arosa, most probably the optical misalignment detected by the inspection in 1992. It was decided to use a statistical approach for correction (homogenization) , which was based on daily mean measurements of D15 and D101 during the period 1986- 1991, D101 being calibrated against the world primary Dobson instrument (D83) in the Dobson intercomparison in 1986 (Sect. 6.2). The Dobson intercomparison of Arosa in 1990 confirmed that D101 was stable against the standard in- strument from 1986 -1991. The homogeneity of the time series before 1949 was obtained by a statistical approach as well. The measurements prior to 1930 should not be used for trend analysis 468. In the Dobson intercomparison of Arosa in 1995, a substantial shift between the Arosa instrument D101 against the reference i n- strument was found. The applied correction to obtain a homogenous series is described by Staehelin et al. (1998). The findings were basically confirmed by the Arosa Dobson intercomparison of 1999 (for more information refer to Scarnato et al., 2010). Br\u00f6nnimann and Compo (2012) confirmed by comparison with meteorological data the reliability of the homogenized Arosa Dobson series back to the start of the measurements. In Staehelin et al. (1998b) total ozone trends based on the homoge- nized Arosa total ozone series were published. 466 Refer to footnote 227 on page 47. 467 The statistical Langley plot method is described in Section 7.5. 468 Remember, that G\u00f6tz used the F\u00e9ry spectrometer (Sect. 9.1.2.b Total Ozone observations) operated at the LKO for his expedition to Svalbard (Sect. 3.8), but the instrument was damaged in transit back to Switzerland and the instrument was subsequently shipped to the laboratory in Oxford for repair (Sect. 3.8.3 ). This resulted in a substantial number of months of missing data at the LKO in 1930 and 1931 and most probably introduced a break in the early part of the Arosa series. 98 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) Figure 40: Calibration of new Dobson instruments (D15 and D18) by comparison with \"D1\" in Oxford prior to transport to Arosa ( figure adapted and data extracted from Dobson and Normand, 1962).

Irina Petropavlovskikh discovered 469 two breaks in the Umkehr series of Arosa (Petropavlovskikh et al, 2001; see Figure 1 in Zanis et al., 2006). The long- term Umkehr series is based mainly on measurements of the Dobson instruments D15 (1956- 1988, manual) and D51 (1989- today, automated, see Section 9.1.2.b) . After 1988, manu- al Umkehr measurements with D15 were continued but much less frequently. In September 1992, D15 was replaced by D62 470. The first break, which occurred in 1988, was caused by the instrumen- tal change from D15 to D51. The overlap between D51 and the less frequent D15 measurements from 1 January 1988 to 30 January 1989 were used for homogenization. The second break in the Umkehr measurements occurred in 1992. It was caused by the replacement of the chopper -motor in D51, which was required because of a strong lightning stroke in August 1992. Apparently , the new settings led to a misalignment of the shaft recorder. A note in the logbook of the data was used for the correction. For more details and trend analysis results refer to Zanis et al. (2006). 469 As part of her contrib ution to the EU -project REVUE. 470 For the Umkehr measurements performed with D101 refer to Section 9.1.2.b Umkehr measurements . 99 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozo ne measurements 7 1988 -2014: Period of MeteoSwiss and IACETH Contribution of Swiss Scientists to the Scientific Advisory Group 7.5 of GAW/WMO Atmospheric ozone measurements are crucial for determining long- term changes in (stratospheric) ozone as caused by manmade emissions of ozone depleting substances (Sect. 5.1 and 6.1). Ground- based long- term series such as the total ozone record of Arosa are key measurements in all WMO/UNEP Ozone As sessments 471. Furthermore, ground- based total ozone measurements are also very important for evaluation of the long- term stability of satellite ozone measurements , which allow obtaining quasi global stratospheric ozone trends (Sect. 6.1 and Sect. 10.5). Since the 1970s, the WMO coordinates the world- wide network of ground- based stratospheric ozone stations first through the Global Ozone Observing System (GO 3OS) and thereafter through the Glob- al Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Programme (WMO, 1997, 2001 and 2004; Staehelin, 2008; Dlugokencky et al., 2010). The responsible body in GAW is the Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) for ozone. SAG -Ozone is mainly responsible for overseeing the network of stratospheric ground- based Figure 41: Annual meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group for O zone (SAG -Ozone) held in October 2005 at the Aer o- logical Station of MeteoSwiss at Payerne (Switzerland) (third person from the left : Johannes Staehelin, second person from the right : Pierre Viatte - the authors of this report) (Photo MeteoSwiss).

SAG - Ozone is also mandated to provide SOPs (Standard Operation Procedures) enabling institutions like weather services to perform high quality measurements, to evaluate the quality of the measur e- ments, to promote instruments calibration and to oversee the work of the WOUDC 472. Both authors of this report 473 acted as members of SAG -Ozone (see Figure 41). Determination of total ozone amount from Dobson and Brewer spectrophotometers requires knowledge of the intensity of solar radiation outside the atmosphere at the respective wavelengths as described in Section 3.7.1. This information was not directly available when Dobson instruments were introduced, but it can be obtained indirectly by plotting the values at different solar zenith angles by extrapolation to an air mass of zero, providing the \"instrumental\" constants that cover the extrater-restrial constants. This procedure is called the Langley plot method. This method is regularly applied to the world primary Dobson and Brewer spectrophotometers. Within the present networks the indi- vidual station instruments are regularly compared 474 with the primary instruments. The absolute cal i- bration of the world primary Dobson instrument D83 is achieved by the Langley plot method based on measurements performed at the Mauna Loa Observatory at Hawaii (Komhyr et al., 1989). The application of the Langley plot method requires measurements of at least one half -day during which (besides clear sky and low aerosol content) total ozone remains constant. At midlatitude stations, total ozone often varies which is caused by changing meteorological conditions and it is very difficult to confirm stability in total ozone for a particular half -day. However, a similar type of method can be applied to a large collection of measurements by a statistical approach called statistical Langley plot method, which was originally proposed by Dobson and Normand (1962). The valid measurements are plotted against solar elevation for every individual half -day. In the next step the results of the extrapolation are finally averaged to derive an averaged value of the instrumental constants. This approach provides reliable results if it can be assumed that no systematic diurnal variation of column ozone exists when measurements are averaged over a large collection of measurements, e.g. of one year. If this assumption can be viewed as fulfilled and if a large collection of data including a large variety of solar zenith angles is available, the statistical Langley plot method allows updating the instrumental constants of Dobson instruments without relying on intercomparisons. (D\u00fctsch, 1984). D\u00fctsch applied this method 475 for the Arosa series until 1986 and for D15 until 1992 (Sect. 7.4.1) 476. In the worldwide network of Dobson measurements, the systematic comparison of individual Dobson instruments by Dobson intercomparisons was introduced in the 1970s and was formalized in the 1980s and 1990s (e.g. Staehelin et al., 2018a). Intercomparisons of stations' Dobson instruments were planned to take place approximately every 4 years from the 1990s 477. This continuously i m- proved the data quality of the world- wide Dobson network (Komhyr et al., 1989; K\u00f6hler et al., 2004, Staehelin et al., 2019b). 472 Refer to footnote 419 on page 86. 473 Viatte from 1996 to 2007 (replaced by St\u00fcbi of MeteoSwiss in 2007) and Staehelin from 2004 -2013 (2005 -2013 as chairperson). 474 Indirectly, namely by comparing with regional standard instruments which are regularly compared with the world standard Dobson spectrophotometer D83. 475 Note that the statistical Langley plot method was also used in the Antarctic ozone measurements published by Farman et al. (1 985). 476 The new instrumental constants were applied for the past year as well , yielding small chages for the total ozone values . 477 Because of the extraord inary stability of Dobson instruments the interval for intercom parison of station instruments was increased (in absence of particular concern) to 5 years by the SAG -Ozone in 2013 (Ulf K\u00f6hler) . 101 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 7 1988 -2014: Period of MeteoSwiss and IACETH Joint scientific achievements 7.6 7.6.1 The role of the Swiss Programme GAW -CH In the period since 1988, the collaboration between MeteoSwiss and ETH Z\u00fcrich has been succes s- ful, which is reflected in the large number of common publications (and possibly) including close to 50 articles published in peer reviewed journals (Annex 5 ). In the first years D\u00fctsch, although retired, was still active in scientific research, e.g. studying Umkehr measurements and the effect of solar cycle on total ozone. On an initiative of M\u00fcller 478, the Swiss GAW Programme (GAW -CH) (M\u00fcller, 1994) was established and started in the beginning of 1995 (based on a decisi on of the Swiss Federal Council 479 of 25 N o- vember 1994) as the contribution of Switzerland to the worldwide GAW Programme of WMO, cover- ing services 480 and operational monitoring. Concerning the latter, the goal of GAW -CH is to coordi- nate as well as to maintain and extend the measurements of Switzerland contributing to GAW includ-ing ozone, radiation, aerosols and greenhouse gases (M\u00fcller and Viatte, 2005). The Swiss Federal government allocated 3.8 million CHF to the build- up of the GAW -CH Programme during the years 1995- 1998, as well as a regular contribution of more than 1 million CHF per year for the follow -up activities. The GAW -CH Programme aims to facilitate scientific and technical experiments in the above- mentioned fields as well as to support the use of GAW measurements in scientific research by financing projects. For support by these grants the Swiss atmospheric scientists are invited, every 3-4 years, to submit proposals to MeteoSwiss to conduct scientific research related to GAW. Since 1995, the authors of this report were member of the steering group of GAW -CH 481, which meets twice a year, providing a platform for information exchange and discussion of activities relevant in the context of GAW. Among the supported projects, four PhD theses in atmospheric ozone were f i- nanced by GAW -CH at IACETH (see Table 16). In one of the projects supported by GAW -CH the Institute of Applied Physics of the University (IAP) of Berne was commissioned to develop an Ozone microwave radiometer to be deployed at the Aerological Station in Payerne 482. Dobson and Brewer Intercomparisons were also funded. 7.6.2 Research foci It was well known since the middle of the 1980s that Dobson and Brewer instruments show small but systematic differences in seasonal variation in total ozone, which is particularly relevant if automated Brewer should replace manual Dobson spectrophotometers. The unique Arosa total ozone time s e- ries from Dobson and Brewer instruments allowed studies of the differences between the two instr u- ment types (Staehelin et al., 1998a; Scarnato, 2008; Scarnato et al., 2009 and 2010) as well as their 478 Refer to footnote 462 on page 95. 479 Refer to fo otnote 21 on page 5. 480 One aim of GAW -CH is to support services in favor of the activities of the International GAW Programme (i.e. World Calibration Centers, ozone soundings in Kenya). 481 GAW Landesausschuss. 482 A measurement series of ozone profiles was started in Payerne in 1999 with the microwave radiometer SOMORA in order to com- plement the ozone soundings from Payerne and the Umkehr profiles in Arosa. This was a follow up to the measurements performed by the IAP in 1989 at the LKO with the OGOS instrument (Sect. 9.1.3.7) and later on in Bern with the GROMOS system. 102 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) long- term behavior/trends (St\u00fcbi et al., 2017b) since they are calibrated in different networks (Sect. 9.1.2). The unique series of quasi -simultaneous total ozone measurements of Dobson and Brewer instr u- ments of the LKO were very valuable in quantifying the effect of temperature dependence of the different wavelengths used in the two types of instruments (Redondas et al., 2014). This result was important in the context of the project ACSO in which the effects of ozone absorpt ion cross section on different atmospheric ozone measurements techniques were studied (ACSO, 2015; Orphal et al., 2015). Quantification of the downward ozone trends was a key focus for making long- term stratospheric measurements in the late 1980s and the first part of the 1990s (Sect. 6.1; Staehelin et al., 1998b and 2001). These trends were viewed as a consequence of increasing stratospheric ODS concentrations. Subsequent studies were devoted to quantify the contribution of other processes enhancing the ob-served downward trends, such as long- term climate variability, which were viewed in connection with tropopause altitude (Steinbrecht et al., 1998) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) or Arctic Osci l- lation (AO) (Appenzeller et al., 2000; Steinbrecht et al., 2001; Weiss, 2001; Weiss et al., 2001). Br\u00f6nnimann et al. (2000) studied the effect of Eurasian climate indices on total ozone at Arosa; the long total ozone series of Arosa played a key role in studying the effect of El Ni\u00f1o on stratospheric ozone over Europe and the effect on El Ni\u00f1o on Eurasian climate in the 1940s (Br\u00f6nnimann et al., 2004a and 2004b). Koch used backward trajectory modeling to study stratospheric ozone variability at midlatitudes making use of the ozonesonde measurements of Payerne (Koch, 2003; Koch et al., 2002 and 2005). The long- term total ozone and Umkehr series were also important in the EU project CANDIDOZ 483 (Zanis et al., 2006; Brunner et al., 2006; Harris et al., 2008). Documentation of the \"turnaround\" in stratospheric ozone trends became more and more important as time went on (e.g. Maeder, 2004; Maeder et al., 2007; Maeder et al., 2010). The Arosa time series was also used to introduce the con- cept of extreme value theory in ozone science (Rieder, 2011; Rieder et al., 2010a and b) and ozonesonde measurements were compared with regular aircraft measurements (Staufer, 2013; Stau- fer et al., 2013 and 2014) 484. 483 CANDIDOZ: Chemical and Dynamical Influences on Decadal Ozone Change. 484 For other related studies see Table 16. 103 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 8 Recent years and future of the LKO 8 Recent years and future of the LKO Scientific requirements 8.1 Since around the second half of the 1990s, the Montreal Protocol (MP) resulted in slow decreases in stratospheric concentrations of ODS and therefore the ozone recovery from ODS is expected to pr o- ceed at a moderate r ate, as predicted in numerical simulations (e.g. Chipperfield et al., 2016 and 2018). Recently Hossaini et al. (2017) showed that a continued large increase in emission of dichlor o- methane, a chemical used as solvent belonging to the class of very short -lived substances (VSLSs), might possibly delay the effect of the MP on the recovery of t he ozone layer by several years 485. However, in the future N2O will become the dominant anthropogenic source gas for stratospheric ozone loss depletion. Climate change infl uences stratospheric ozone in several ways. Greenhouse gas increase leads to stratospheric cooling (particularly pronounced in the upper stratosphere) , which affects ozone chem- istry by changing the reaction rates, which in turn leads to higher stratospheri c ozone concentrations (other effects expected for polar ozone depletion are not discussed here). Chemistry climate models (CCMs) predict an enhancement of the Brewer -Dobson circulation as a consequence of climate change, caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide (Butchart, 2014). By this enhancement of the Brewer Dobson circulation, ozone is transported more rapidly from its source region over the tropics to midlatitudes, leading to higher ozone amounts in extra tropics (the so-called \"super recovery\") and leaving ozone reduced over the tropics. It appears that today the enhancement of the Brewer Dobson circulation cannot be demonstrated by any atmospheric meas- urements. According to CCMs the enhancement of the Brewer Dobson circul ation is expected to become dominant over the recovery from ODS in the extra tropics in the second part of this century. Appropriate CCMs are used to describe the expected evolution of stratospheric ozone as influenced by the decrease in ODS and the ongoing climate change (for a recent update, see e.g. Dhomse et al., 2018). Results of such (stratospheric) CCMs presented earlier suggest a return of total ozone at northern mid- latitudes to the 1980 levels around 2020 (see Figure 42 and Hegglin, 2015). However, the measurements of Arosa (see Figure 42) show a different tendency. 485 Implying limited effects on the recovery of the ozone layer . 104 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) Figure 42: (a) Relative abundance of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS, i.e. volatile halocarbons) expressed as equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) for the midlatitude stratosphere, shown for various scenarios (demonstrating the impact of the Montreal Protocol and its subsequent Adjustments and Amendments) .

Desig ning suitable approaches for merging satellite ozone time series has turned out to be a serious problem. Satellite ozone instruments (e.g. Hassler et al., 2014) have limited life times, the overlap between satellite series is often limited or non- existent, observing properties differ between instr u- ments, thus the method for merging is a challenge (e.g. Tummon et al., 2015; Ball et al., 2017). It is therefore not only very important to find a solution to the merging problem but also to continue high quality stratospheric ozone measurements to follow the slow recovery of the ozone layer from the burden of stratospheric anthropogenic halogens (chlorine and bromine). 107 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observat ory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 8 Recent years and future of the LKO Ball et al. (2018) made use of Bayesian statistical methods 491 to merge satellite measurements and performed time series analysis; they confirmed the increase in stratospheric ozone in the upper stratosphere (panel (b) in Figure 44) that started around the middle of the 1990s in good agreement with the expected increase as shown by the two numerical models and other studies (see SPARC activity LOTUS 2). Ozone measurements of the middle stratosphere (panel (c) in Figure 44) do not show any clear tendency, but a significant and continuing downward trend was found in the satellite measurements in the lower most stratosphere (panel (d) in Figure 44). This decreasing trend (though rather small in absolute amount) strongly affected total ozone at midlatitudes to the extent that the upward trend expected from the successful reduction in ODS by the MP (1987) has remained unde-tected (for more details see Ball et al., 2018). The trend analysis based on five long- term LIDAR data series presented by Zerefos et al. (2018) are consistent with Ball et al. (2018) with respect to the unexpected lower stratospheric ozone decrease. However, the results of two numerical simulations shown on panel (d) of Figure 44 show an increasing tendency in lower stratospheric ozone that con- trasts the presented measurements. The recent numerical simulations presented by Chipperfield et al. (2018) show good agreement with the measurements (see Figure 45) indicating a remarkable increase in 2017. The high values predicted by the numerical simulations for 2017 (see Figure 45) need confirmation by ozone measurements and measurements of the coming years will indicate whether they can be viewed as a beginning of the expected \"ozone recovery\" or not.

The unexpected decrease in the lower most stratospheric ozone found at northern midlatitudes might also be connected to the enhancement of the Brewer -Dobson circulation (see above), however, the documentation of an enhanced Brewer -Dobson circulation from measurements still has high priority. The total ozone series of Arosa is expected to be in future 492 a particularly attractive dataset allowing to demonstrate the predicted enhancement of the Brewer Dobson circulation because of its unique length, including several decades of measurements prior to start of the anthropogenic disturbances (caused by ODS and climate change); this is important for describing natural variability in an anthr o- pogenically undisturbed atmosphere. In the 1990s, the rule of thumb to be considered for reliable long-term (stratospheric) ozone monitor-ing implied to be able to detect trends in the order of 1% (3 DU) per decade considering the dow n- 491 Typically employed as a standard in other fields. 492 See Chapter 10 . 108 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) ward trends observed in northern midlatitudes (see 6.1) - having the consequence that the uncertai n- ty of the total ozone monitoring needs to be considerably smaller 493 494. Today, we are looking to trace the \"recovery\" , but the requirements might be derived from the analysis of Ball et al. (2018) (see Figure 44), which are more difficult to reach as the unexpected and scientifically unexplained changes in the lower stratosphere are approximately 3 times smaller (1 DU per decade). Move of the LKO from Arosa to Davos 8.2 As the justification for founding of the PMOD and the LKO was similar and occurred almost at the same time (as support of the community is concerned), and as the study field was partially overlap-ping while they are at very close geographical location, it is not surprising that the idea of a collabor a- tion between both observatories seemed obvious. However collaboration only took place in the first two years of the LKO, between 1921 and 1923, through the use of the Cd- Cell at Arosa and joint measurement campaigns (i.e. at Muottas Muragl); after this, the cooperation was disrupted due to scientific disagreements, personal and external factors as explained in Section 3.2. Later on, throughout the different periods of the LKO, the collaboration was only occasional and limited. However, the question of a common institute at two places or of a merge respectively a move has been raised several times as shown in Table 8. Although this solution was considered, analyzed and discussed on at least six occasions in in the past, with the aim to generate synergies and related to financial shortage or retirements, it was never realized for different reasons as described in the Chapters 3-7. Beginning of the 2010s, in order to assure the long- term continuation of the ozone monitoring activ i- ties as well as to improve data quality and availability, MeteoSwiss decided to start two projects with the aim of enhancing the technical and scientific support of the ozone program as well as of taking benefit of the synergies between the ozone observations of MeteoSwiss at Arosa and the UV meas-urements performed by the PMOD/WRC in Davos, with the perspective of a possible relocation of the LKO from Arosa to Davos. In an initial project (AutoDob), completed between 2012 and 2014, the Dobson instruments were upgraded from manual to completely automated operation. A second project (A2D4O3) was s tarted in September 2014 with the goal to carry out a study quantifying the effect of the LKO's potential move from Arosa to Davos on the ozone measurements and to analyze the feasibility of such a rel o- cation concerning the organizational structure and the observation programs. 493 Please keep in mind that the long- term monitoring stability is not the same as the uncertainty of an single measurement. 494 The use of several instrument and different different instrument types (two Dobsons and three Brewers) was important to fulfill these requirements. . 109 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 8 Recent years and future of the LKO Tabl e 8: S ummary of ng c ooperati on and merg er of t he LKO Ar os a and t he PMOD D avos as deduc ed from t he curr ent his toric al st udy (f or more det ails s ee the i nf or mati on as gi ven i n t he refer enced s ecti ons).

The Dobson instruments were fully automated by MeteoSwiss under St\u00fcbi 495 allowing for the measurement of both total ozone as well as Umkehr quasi simultaneously with the same system. In the period 2012- 2014, the different Dobson instruments (D62, D51 and D101; for the dates of modifications see Table 9) were updated for fully automated use. The spectrodome was no longer 495 Ren\u00e9 St\u00fcbi, PhD, Sen ior scientist of the Upper Air division of MeteoSwiss at the Aerological Station in Payerne (refer to Section 9.2.3). 110 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) appropriate for fully automatic operation and a new housing was designed and constructed allowing for the entry of the direct solar beam, through a small quartz dome in the roof of the container, into the Dobson instrument. 8.2.2 Simultaneous Brewer and Dobson measurements at Arosa and Davos As the great value of the total ozone series of Arosa lies in its length (unique in the world), the high data quality of the measurements and its homogeneity, it is crucial that the impact of a \"move\" be minimized. This is important in the context of long- term trend determination. Indeed, the distance between the stations at Arosa and Davos is only 13 kilometers and the synoptic meteorological con-ditions are the same at both sites. However, particularly challenging at the present time is the tracing of the systematic upward trends predicted to be particularly small during the slow recovery phase, as expected from the steadily decreasing stratospheric ODS (refer to Sect. 8.1). In order to prepare the final decision of relocating the LKO's total ozone measurements from Arosa to Davos, simultaneous ozone measurements were planed extending over several annual cycles. Simultaneous total ozone measurements between Brewer total ozone measurements at the two sites have been performed since 2011. The differences in total ozone values between the sites are usually small and systematic effects are probably at least partially attributable to a stray light bias and the altitude difference be-tween the two sites (St\u00fcbi et al., 2017a and b). On rare occasions, a time lag due to transport effects was found (Egli and Gr\u00f6bner, 2016) and its quantitative influence requires further study. Simultane-ous Dobson observations at Arosa and Davos are conducted since 2016 to get a suitable basis for an optimal transfer function when moving the instruments from Arosa to Davos. Based on the results of these projects, the management board of MeteoSwiss took on 12 June 2018 the decision to transfer the observations of the LKO Arosa to the PMOD in Davos on 1 January 2019. The monitor ing activities were thus outsourced to the PMOD, but MeteoSwiss keeps the ownership of the instruments and the responsibility of the data collected. On 28 September 2018, two additional spectrophotometers were transferred to Davos (D51 and Br156) in addition to the systems already installed there. Since this date the center of gravity of the ozone activities switched to Davos. Two spectrophotometers (D62 and Br40) remain in Arosa until the end of 2020 in order to reach almost 10 years of simultaneous Brewer and 5 years of simultane- ous Dobson measurements at both sites 496. Before this operation the Brewer spectrophotometers of the LKO participated to an intercomparison held in Arosa in July 2018 in order to validate these sy s- tems against the standard instrument Br185 of Iza\u00f1a. At the same time, the Dobson spectrophotom e- ters of the LKO were compared with the D64, the regional standard for Europe. 496 This goes beyond the requirements (3 years) of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) of WMO which apply in the case of relocation of measurement sites . 111 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO 9 Overall development of the LKO Looking at the evolution of the LKO since 1921 ( Chapt. 2 to 8), it is clear that not only the justific a- tions for the ozone measurements at the LKO in Arosa have changed during its existence, but also the organizational aspects have undergone quite drastic changes. The continuation of D\u00fctsch after the \"one- man show\" of G\u00f6tz allowed the embedding of the LKO in an institute of a technical univers i- ty, providing the opportunity to situate the LKO in a much more stabilized and research- oriented environment. The transfer to MeteoSwiss later on brought the advantage for the LKO to be integrated into an institute, which has the task of guaranteeing optimal operational conditions favoring long- term measurements, the research still being covered by an institute of ETH Z\u00fcrich (IACETH). In the follow-ing chapter the aim is to look at the history of the LKO with a comprehensive view concerning the measurements (Sect. 9.1), the personnel involved (Sect. 9.2) as well as the budget available (Sect. 9.3). This brings in a new perspective allowing comparison of the different periods. Measurements 9.1 From the preceding chapters it is obvious that the LKO's reputation is primarily based on the long-term stratospheric ozone measurements; the measuring program leading to the world's longest total ozone and Umkehr series will be synthesized in Section 9.1.2. However, we start with the present a- tion of the meteorological measurements because these go back to 1889 and were relevant for the establishment of the LKO (Sect. 9.1.1). In the course of time, the basic measuring program has been extended by a series of additional measurements at the LKO and at Tschuggen 497 (see Figure 1 for the locations) being the subject of Section 9.1.3. An important source of information was the station history by Aeschbacher and Schill (2016). 9.1.1 Meteorological measurements Most of the climatological information used by G\u00f6tz in his studies on the (radiation) climate of Arosa (G\u00f6tz, 1926b and 1954) was based on the data of the official climatological station of MeteoSwiss (Sect. 9.1.1.a) complemented by special radiation components (Sect. 9.1.3.a) . Also during the D\u00fctsch era, the meteorological observations used for the purpose of the LKO were mostly those of the MeteoSwiss station. But in all periods, especially since the 1990s, supplementary meteorological measurements were performed at the LKO platform and at Tschuggen (Sect. 9.1.1.b) . 497 Refer to footnote 98 on page 28. 112 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) 9.1.1.a) Climatological station of Mete oSwiss in Arosa Meteorological measurements 498 in Arosa were started by the national weather service Meteo - Swiss 499 on 1 November 1889 500. First, the measurements were performed in the villa Fri sia 501 at Innerarosa. On 1 October 1900, the station was moved to the Sanatorium Arosa (see Figure 1) where G\u00f6tz started on 1 November 1921 with his own measurements. Because of the problems related to the frequent change of the meteorological observers 502, G\u00f6tz agreed to take care of the observational program of MeteoSwiss from 1 February 1926 onwards. When G\u00f6tz moved to his own house (Villa Firnelicht) on April 1926, the meteorological station still remained at Sanatorium Arosa for four more years and was installed at Villa Firnelicht later on 1 April 1930. At the beginning of 1954, the LKO moved to the Florentinum (see Figure 1; see also Section 3.11 and 4.2) and the meteorological station was transferred simultaneously to this location and installed in due distance of the Florentinum building. When the LKO was installed in the Haus Steinbruch nearby in 1973 (Sect. 5.3), the instrument shelter remained near the Florentinum until 1996, while part of the instruments (like anemometer and sunshine duration meter) was directly displaced on the new LKO platform. On 26 November 1996, a Stevenson screen 503 was installed in the vicinity of the Haus Steinbruch 504. Towards the end of 2015, the measurements of the climatological station of MeteoSwiss were completely automated and moved to a new location at the alp Maran. Between 1926 and 1953, the meteorological measurements were operated by G\u00f6tz (with some as- sistance of other persons such as his wife Margarethe G\u00f6tz). After G\u00f6tz's death, the meteorological observations continued to be part of the regular duties of the LKO and were handled by the LKO staff 505. When the station was automated and moved to Maran in 2015, the LKO staff was released from the observational work -related climatological station of MeteoSwiss in Arosa. 9.1.1.b) Additional meteorological measurements at the LKO and at Tschuggen There are some hints that special meteorological measurements were performed at Tschuggen dur- ing the G\u00f6tz and D\u00fctsch eras, although probably only for short periods 506. In order to assure an optimal meteorological embedding of the ozone observations as well as other measurements done by MeteoSwiss and the guests, completely separate meteorological measur e- 498 The parameters pressure, wind, temperature, air humidity, sunshine duration, precipitation as well as snow height and cloud c over were measured. 499 Refer to footnote 13 on page 4. 500 Since 1884 climatological observations performed by Dr O. Herwig, physician in Arosa, are available in written form. 501 The Villa Frisia was a \"dependence\" of the Villa Dr. Herwig; the meteorological station was managed by Dr. Janssen, private teacher and guesthouse owner (G\u00f6tz, 1926b). 502 As mentioned in the station history of the climatological station Arosa at MeteoSwiss ). 503 Stevenson screen is an enclosure to shield meteorological instruments against precipitation and heat from direct radiation. 504 The old screen remained near the Florentinum up to 31 May 1999 for more than 2.5 years of parallel measurements. 505 Until 1973, MeteoSwiss paid financial compensation for the work accomplished (see Figure 51); there is no information available about such a compensation concerning the period 1973- 1987 (when the LKO was integrated in the IACETH). 506 I t is rather difficult to be more precise on these measurements as they were not clearly documented. 113 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmosp heric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO ments were continuously performed at the LKO platform from 4 June 1992 507 and at Tschuggen from 5 August 1994 508 in addition to the measurements of the official climatological station of MeteoSwiss. Intensive cloud observations going beyond the needs of the climatological station of MeteoSwiss were part of the measurement program of the LKO throughout the different periods of the LKO. In normal operation, each manual Dobson reading was accompanied by a visual cloud observation. Ideally, also the time between the readings was documented when changes in the cloud cover oc-curred. Intensive cloud cover observations at the LKO were maintained after the complete automat i- zation of the meteorological station of MeteoSwiss and the move of this station to Maran 509; they were abandoned in 2018 when the center of gravity switched to Davos. 9.1.2 O zone measuring program and instruments use d G\u00f6tz had started measurements of stratospheric ozone with sun spectrophotometers as early as 1926 510. In this section we provide detailed information on the type of instruments used at different stages, the detection techniques involved as well as the kind of measurements performed (direct sun - zenith sky) and the operation mode of the systems (redundancy, observation frequency and degree of automation). These measurements are summarized in Figure 46 and Table 9. A synthesis on the number of observations carried out with each of the systems operated at the LKO is given in Table 10 for the total column ozone measurements and in Table 11 for the Umkehr measurements. 9.1.2.a) Arosa ultraviolet spectrograph G\u00f6tz subm itted a request to Bernet 511 asking for financial support to build a spectrograph a s early as October 1923 (G\u00f6tz, 2 October 1923). In January 1924, he contacted (G\u00f6tz, 21 January 1924) the company Carl Zeiss (Jena) , which had already developed the spectrograph used by Dorno at the PMOD in Davos (Fr\u00f6hlich, 2016). Based on the experience with this instrument 512 G\u00f6tz was obvious- ly convinced that an instrument with crossed prisms like the design proposed by Fabry and Buisson (Fabry and Buisson, 1921) was a prerequisite. A letter of Zeiss Jena (Zeiss, 30 January 1926) seems to imply that there was competition with Dobson at that time in constructing an operational spectr o- graph 513. However, the progress of Zeiss Jena turned out to be very sluggish. 507 Including pressure, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction, sunshine duration, precipitation, brig htness, UV- and global radiation. 508 Covering air temperature, relative humi dity, wind speed and wind direction as well as UV - and global radiation. 509 The cloud cover gives an indication on the changing sky conditions and therefore on the quality of the ozone and radiation mea s- urements. 510 Remember that on the basis of his early experiences with the Cd- Cell (Sect. 3.2) between 1921 and 1923, G\u00f6tz was convinced that it was more appropriate to study ozone which determines UV -B radiation at the Earth's surface than to extend UV -B radiation climatology (Sect. 3.10). 511 Refer to footnote 67 on page 16. 512 G\u00f6tz, upon request of Dorno, tried in 1920 to characterize the instrument of Dorno at the astronomical observatory in T\u00fcbingen, with disappointing results .

G\u00f6tz was therefore not satisfied with the time response and the conditions offered by Zeiss and ad- dress ed a similar request to Schmidt and Haensch (Berlin) (G\u00f6tz, 29 March 1926). This company finally produced the desired instrument based on a design initiated resp. supervised by G\u00f6tz (Schmidt and Haensch, 29 June 1926) and financed by the KVV Arosa (G\u00f6tz, 1927). The many let- ters exchanged with this company show that the development process was also rather complex and time-consuming (Schmidt and Haensch, 21 March 1928; Bernet, 2 May 1928). It took two and a half years to build the instrument , which was fi nally delivered in October 1928 514. G\u00f6tz presented the design of this instrument at the first International Conference on Ozone 515 (G\u00f6tz, 1929b) and he used this instrument in Svalbard (Sect. 3.8). Two publications making use of the measurements tak- en with this instrument are available (G\u00f6tz, 1931b; G\u00f6tz and Sch\u00f6nmann, 1948) , but no data could be found in the LKO archives. The spectrograph was viewed by G\u00f6tz as a universal instrument and too time- consuming to be used in the daily work. The system was still in the LKO inventory when Perl took over the LKO on 1 November 1953 (Sect. 3.11). In 1954, discussions were held on how to deal with a request from the Meteorological Institute of the University of Mainz asking to buy the instr u- ment for half of the original price. The KVV Arosa supported selling the instrument, but Huber 516 refused the deal. There is no trace of this instrument now. 514 The costs (Schmidt -Haensch, 11 October 1928) amounted to nearly 10, 000 Reichsmark (RM), approximately 12,500 CHF (accor d- ing to the historical effective exchange rates), corresponding to roughly 86,000 CHF in 2015 (according to the consumer price index of Swistoval, www.swistoval.ch , state of 14.1.2019 (Pfister and Studer, 2019) (Information on exchange rates and inflation adjustment made available by Tobias Straumann, Professor of Economic History of the University of Z\u00fcrich). 515 The first International Ozone Conference t ook place in Paris on 15- 17 May 1929 . 516 Refer to footnote 305 on page 66. 115 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light C limatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO 9.1.2.b) Dobson spectrophotometers The main spectrophotometers used at the LKO for measurements of stratospheric ozone were i n- struments designed by Dobson (Walshaw, 1989) 517. The realization of the spectrographs developed by Dobson in the early 1920s turned out to be very rapid and successful such that a series of five instruments was already operational at the beginning of 1926. In establishing his first European Network (Dobson, 1968), Dobson submitted a proposal of collaboration to G\u00f6tz with the idea that the latter would join the network with his own system (Dob-son, 9 November 1925). G\u00f6tz was very much interested in Dobson's invitation for ozone cooperation, but as he was aware that the development of his own instrument was delayed, he asked to be sup- plied with one of Dobson's spectrographs (G\u00f6tz, 11 November 1925). Dobson who expressed inter-est in including the site of Arosa regretted that G\u00f6tz was not able to bring in an additional instrument but otherwise saw the advantage of obtaining uniform measurements and therefore agreed to r e- serve one of his instruments for the LKO (Sect. 3.7.2). Total Ozone observations The F\u00e9ry spectrograph N o.2 (\" D2\") 518 based on photographic detection, was sent to G\u00f6tz on 26 April 1926. The first observation at Arosa was made on 23 July 1926. Dobson incidentally proposed that the spectra obtained in Arosa could be evaluated by G\u00f6tz himself , which was not the usual way of cooperation as noted by Dobson in the letter from 17 December 1925 (see Figure 18) 519. The instrument \"D2\" was the standard instrument of the LKO from 23 July 1926 until July 1939 520, when it was replaced by spectrophotometer D7, a new generation instrument. \"D2\" , which stayed in Arosa until 1954, was then used (Staehelin et al., 1998a) to make quasi -simultaneous measurements with the new generation instruments 521 and it was operated if problems arose with the instruments used in routine operation. At the request of Dobson, \"D2\" was returned to Oxford by March 1954 (several months before the G\u00f6tz's death), after the LKO moved to the Florentinum in December 1953 (Sect. 3.11). Another F\u00e9ry spectrograph No.3 (termed \"D3\") 522 was sent to Arosa in February 1930. Dobson made this second instrument available to G\u00f6tz for \"simultaneous observations at high & low stations\" (Dob- son, 27 June 1930). According to the data inventory (see Table 10) 100 measurements were taken with this instrument. 517 The concepts of total ozone spectrophotometers designed by Dobson are summarized in Section 3.7.1. 518 The F\u00e9ry instrument No.2 was termed \"D2\" in the LKO measuring sheets (also used in Birrer, 1975a und b). Please note, that we do not recommend us ing this abbreviation \"D2\" for the F\u00e9ry instruments because it is not used internationally and only leads to unnecessary confusion; refer to Section 3.7.1 for common use of abbreviations of the Dobson spectrophotometers (Dx) . 519 Letter Dobson (to G\u00f6tz), 7 December 1925. \" What we are doing in the other cases is to [....] send unexposed plates [....] asking people to return the exposed plates [....] it is possible you might prefer and measure your own plates .\". 520 This instrument was also used by G\u00f6tz during the Svalbard expedition (Sect. 3.8) for the direct sun (total ozone) measurements, together with his own instrument, the Arosa ultraviolet spectrograph described in Section 9.1.2.a, for the zenith sky observations. 521 F irst with D7 between 1939 and 1945 and then with D15 from April to June 1950 (20 measurements, according Staehelin et al. 1998a). 522 The instrument No.3 (termed \"D3\" in the LKO measuring sheets) came back from Egypt and was sent by Dobson to Arosa together with the repaired No.2 (\"D2\") after the Svalbard expedition (Sect. 3.8.3 ). 116 Scientific Re port MeteoSw iss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) Table 9: Spectrometers used at the LKO and at the LKO Arosa betw een 1926 and 2018.Standard Instrument TO and 1) Arosa UV -Spectrograph a) a)Fabry -Buisson type spectrograph, build by Schmidt -Haensch (Berlin) from Mar. 1 926 to Oct. 1 928 on a design supervised by G\u00f6tz, financed by the Kurverein (Tourismus) Arosa. b) Instrument operated in Svalbard 1929 (with D2). c) Instrument removed of operation after 1954 (exact date not known). 2) Dobson Spectrophotometers a) Total Ozone Measurements Jul. 1 926-Jul. 1 939 Jul. 1 939-Aug. 1949 Aug. 1 949-Aug. 1 992 Aug. 1 992-Sep. 2 013 Oct. 2 013-today 2014 -18 short periods a) In favorable weather conditions. b) F\u00e9ry type spectrograph / name D2 given by D\u00fctsch (not internationaly used) / operated in Spitsbergen 1929 (with Arosa spectrograph). c) Since Jan. 20 16 operated at PMOD in Davos. d) Intern.

This instrument was made available by the International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences (IAMAS) through Dobson (president of the Ozone Sub-Committee). Dobson's objective in placing such an instrument with photoelectric detection at the LKO was to determine reliable data of the ext raterrestrial or instrumental constants (Sect. 7.5 and D\u00fctsch, 1986) in the favorable climate conditions of Arosa, as formulated in a letter to G\u00f6tz (Dobson, 17 May 1939): \"I therefore wondered whether you would be willing to have an instrument at Arosa and to make some of the necessary measurements\" 524. Dobson came to Arosa from 18 July to end of July 1939 525 to install and set up the new spectrophotometer. The instrument D7, which was the standard instrument of Arosa until 26 August 1949, was obviously given back after having served at the LKO (date of shipping unknown) as it was subsequently deployed at other stations in the Dobson network (in Singapore since 1970). Dobson spectrophotometers with photomultipliers were in operation at the LKO from 1949 onwards. When Dobson was ready with a photomultiplier version of the spectrophotometer, Arosa was again considered by him to be the first -choice place to determine the new instrumental constants of the updated instruments (Dobson, 31 December 1947): \"Now as regards your instrument, that is what I am going to suggest: We should get one instrument here [Oxford] into as good order as possible fitted with multiplier etc. and send it to you. We should use this instrument to make a re- determination of the extraterrestrial values and on this re- determined value all the other instruments will be calibrat- ed. The instrument should also be used for an entirely new determination of the vertical distribution of the ozone 526. What do you think about this programme? It would mean asking you a great deal of observing work. On the other hand, your climate is so very much better than we are likely to get elsewhere that it would be a great advantage to get the work done in Arosa\". Dobson arranged for the Ozone Sub- Committ ee of IAMAS (Sect. 3.4) to make the new Dobson spectrophotometer avail a- ble for deployment at the LKO. Dobson himself installed the instrument D15 at the LKO; he stayed in Arosa from 23 August to 11 September 1949 527. Spectrophotometer D15 went into operation on 27 August 1949 and was run at the LKO for several decades. However, some problems of D15 were known; D\u00fctsch believed that they were caused by internal stray light (Staehelin et al., 1998a). In summer 1989, D15 was equipped with an electronic system which allowed semi -automated handling and was operated from 2 August 1989 in a rotating spectrodome (Sect. 7.3). Unfortunately , it was damaged by a lightening stroke in August 1992. The instrument D15 was replaced with the Dobson spectrophotometer D62 (see below). When D15 was removed from operational measurements Archie Asbridge inspected the D15 very carefully finding that the instrument was not operated in proper optical alignment (Sect. 7.4.1; for more details including the required homogenizations see Staehelin et al., 1988a) 528. D15 was subsequently completely refurbished (25 July - 6 August 1994). 523 The F\u00e9ry spectrographs and the Dobson spectrophotometers were numbered according two distinct lists. Dobson numbered the F\u00e9ry instruments (No. x) whereas all Dobson spectrophotometers obtained subsequent numbers independent of the detection device (Dx) (Sect. 3.7.1). The official WMO list of Dobson spectrophotometers does not include instruments with photographic detection. 524 Note that D\u00fctsch used this method to update regularly the instrumental constants of the instruments of Arosa (D\u00fctsch, 1984). 525 Letters Dobson, 11 July & 2 August 1939. 526 This can be understood as an invitat ion of Dobson to undertake Umkehr measurements in Arosa. with the new instrument D15 equipped with a photomultiplier. Such measurements were indeed performed (letter of Perl, 7 November 1950) but apparently nev er published (nor analyzed). Regular Umkehr measurements were introduced by D\u00fctsch in 1956. 527 Letters Dobson, 14 August & 14 September 1949. 528 After this finding, D\u00fctsch confirmed that the optical alignment of D15 was never changed. Figure 40 provides evidence of a problem of D15 before it was shipped to Arosa when assuming that the value measured around September 1955 was not a reading error. 119 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO The repaired instrument was then sent to Botswana in April 2000 529. Dobson D15 served as the standard instrument of the LKO Arosa from 27 August 1949 to 3 August 1992. On 16 April 1966, a secondary instrument, Dobson spectrophotometer D101, was unveiled at the LKO. This instrument had been purchased by IACETH on a project basis 530 in the first year when D\u00fctsch became professor at ETH Z\u00fcrich (Sect. 5.1). This system was manually operated on a routine basis as a redundant instrument, in parallel to Dobson D15. In summer 1989, D101 underwent the same modifications as D15 and was also operated in the spectrodome in a semi -automated fashion (Sect. 7.3). After a complete renewal of the electronic and acquisition system in the period from September 2013 to July 2014, the system was operated fully automatically in Arosa. On 13 January 2016, Dobson spectrophotometer D101 was placed in new housing at the PMOD in Davos in order to compare the results obtained at both sites based on multiannual observations and to underpin experimentally that the decision of a transfer of the LKO platform from Arosa to Davos was feasible (Sect. 8.2). Since August 1992 when D15 was removed, D101 served as the new standard instrument of Arosa until its full automation in September 2013. Spectrophotometer D51 531 arrived in Arosa in the late 1960s. This instrument was upgraded in early 1970s in order to perform automatic column measurements of ozone (R\u00e4ber, 1973). The automation of this Dobson instrument was the subject of the PhD thesis of Jost R\u00e4ber , which, however, was never submitted. The instrument was operated intermittently between January 1975 and December 1984, but apparently these data were never sent to WOUDC 532. The project was officially disconti n- ued in June 1985 533. The Dobson spectrophotometer D62 534 was installed at the LKO on 6 September 1992 in order to replace D15 and became the new secondary instrument. When arriving in Arosa, D62 was equipped with the same electronic system as D101 in order to be operated in a semi -automated mode in the spectrodome. Thanks to an upgrade of the electronic and the acquisition system in March 2012 the measurements were performed thereafter in a completely automated manner in a new housing. It was planned that D62 would replace D101 as standard instrument at Arosa from September 2013 to December 2015 due to the upgrade works on D101. Umkehr measurements The Dobson spectrophotometers presented above were also used for the zenith sky measurements regularly performed at the LKO Arosa in order to obtain Umkehr profiles. 529 As decided by the SAG -Ozone which supervises the global network of WMO/GAW (Sect. 7.5 ). 530 This SNSF project had the main goal of introducing ozonesoundings in Switzerland, first in Thalwil (1966 -68), later in Payerne (since 1968) (refer to Jeannet et al., 2007) aiming to get complementary ozone profiles. 531 The Dobson instrument D51 came to Arosa on long -term loan from the IO3C around 1970. It was initially lent by the IO 3C to Aarhus, then in 1964/1965 to the Belgian -Dutch Antarctic base. 532 The total ozone values of the automated Dobson spectrophotometer D51 were compared in 1976 for one month with the measur e- ments of the two other manually operated Dobson instruments in Arosa (R\u00e4ber, 1976). S tatistics for 11 months from November 1983 to December 1984 are available from the diploma thesis of Thomas Moser (Moser, 1985). 533 D51 was then updated in order to perform automated Umkehr measurements and used as the standard Umkehr instrument at Arosa since the late 8 0's (see below Section 9.1.2.b Umkehr measurements ). 534 The Dobson spectrophotometer D62 was provided on a long- term loan basis by the Environment and Climate Change Canad a in 1992. 120 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) Tabl e 11: The LK O Br156 1956 173 1987 104 128 104 1957 226 1988 132 74 132 87 1958 250 1989 299 26 299 52 1959 85 1990 311 23 311 224 1960 0 1991 124 33 124 177 1961 237 1992 0 0 0 0 1962 297 1993 0 0 0 0 1963 253 1994 0 0 0 0 1964 254 1995 18 17 328 551 1965 215 1996 12 13 330 554 1966 134 1997 25 24 393 567 1967 238 1998 16 15 357 557 1968 202 226 1999 17 16 329 509 1969 163 192 2000 20 23 340 558 1970 148 181 2001 26 25 325 458 1971 184 198 2002 34 38 360 538 1972 150 182 2003 74 73 402 552 1973 150 165 2004 46 45 348 556 1974 130 144 2005 44 45 359 548 69 52 1975 197 233 2006 44 44 363 547 322 313 1976 185 202 2007 48 47 395 556 312 314 1977 122 195 2008 47 44 396 513 288 291 1978 122 102 2009 39 39 439 562 293 306 1979 143 174 2010 38 38 411 461 266 216 1980 147 179 2011 10 10 316 618 280 288 1981 122 143 2012 76 31 146 526 229 254 1982 46 188 2013 64 28 226 560 235 268 1983 0 232 2014 46 19 92 488 344 310 1984 0 190 2015 102 143 359 447 1985 130 187 2016 53 3 400 452 1986 157 166 2017 183 19 458 419 a) Number of Umkehr profiles y: - D15, D51, D62 and D101 (since 1989): sunshine) - Br40: retrieved profiles; Br72 and Br156: days with retrieved profiles (not necessarly valid) The years 1983 -84 and 1992 -94 are disturbed by volcanic eruptions (El Chichon, Pinatubo) . Two spectrophotometers with photoelectric detection (Dobson Instruments D1 and D2 535) were brought by Dobson to Arosa in June 1932 in order to realize the very fi rst Umkehr measurement campaign 536 (Sect. 3.8.5). One instrument was used for the Umkehr observations, the second for the 535 These are the instruments termed No.1 and No.2 in Figure 11 of Dobson (1968). Note that the latter is obviously different from the instrument \"D2\" corresponding to the F\u00e9ry spectrograph used in Arosa (see 9.1.2.b Total Ozone observations ). 536 Before this campaign, only four Umkehr curves were recorded in Oxford in January 1931 (Sect. 3.8.5 ). 121 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest at mospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO total ozone measurements performed during the Umkehr readings 537. The data from this campaign was analyzed in G\u00f6tz et al. (1934a). A number of Umkehr measurements were later on undertaken with the Dobson spectrophotometer D15 (equipped with photomultiplier) in 1950 (Perl, 7 November 1950), but the results were apparently never published (nor analyzed) 538. After a series of trials in December 1955, D\u00fctsch 539 initiated in January 1956 Umkehr observations with D15 on a routine basis (Sect. 4.2 and 5.1), thereby laying the foundation of the long- term Umkehr series of Arosa. From January 1968 onwards, redundant Umkehr measurements were also performed on a regular basis with D101, with the same observational frequency as with D15 up to August 1992, but D15 was considered as the standard instrument for the Umkehr observations from January 1956 to January 1989. The D51 system was progressively modified 540 between summer 1985 and January 1989 allowing first semi- automated Umkehr measurements (exclusively Umkehr observations on the C wavelength pair) and fully automated Umkehr measurements since February 1989. The fully automated spectr o- photometer D51 served now as the standard instrument for the Umkehr measurements , but manual readings were still performed 3- 6 times per month with D15 and D101 in parallel with D51, thereby assuring a redundancy with instrument D51. When D15 was taken out of service (see above) it was replaced by D62 so that there were still two redundant manual Umkehr readings. In March 2006, a first renewal of the turning table and the electronics took place. The electronic and acquisition system of D51 was completely changed and upgraded in January -February 2012. Umkehr me asurements 541 at different wavelengths could now be collected with this instrument, since November 2016 in a new housing. These modifications will make necessary a new homogenization of the Umkehr series in the future. 9.1.2.c) Brewer spectrophotometers When fully automated Brewer spectrophotometers were introduced at the LKO in 1988 and in the following years (Sect. 7.3), the expectation was to compare Brewer and Dobson instruments by par- allel measurements for a few years in order to replace the still partly manually operated Dobson i n- struments and therefore to re duce manpower costs (Sect. 7.6.2) as well as to measure UV -B at the Earth's surface. An initial system (Br40) was installed in September 1988, a second system (Br72) in June 1992 and a third one (Br156) in July 1998. In the first years, the measurement schedules of these three systems were defined in such a way that Br40 was focusing on total ozone measur e- 537 Dobson returned to Oxford in August 1932 with one of the instruments; the second one was shipped back in October 1933, more than one year after the end of the campaign in June 1933. Afte r one instrument returned to Oxford the spectrographic instrument \"D2\" routinely operated at the LKO was used for the total ozone measurements during the Umkehr observations . 538 Refer also to footenote 526 on page 118. 539 R emember that Umkehr measurements were a key subject in D\u00fctsch's career (Sect. 4.2 and 5.1). 540 MeteoSwiss (Hoegger 434) was already strongly involved in these transformations since 1986. This technical upgrading was started in the context of a diploma work of the University of Applied Sciences ( Fachhochschule ) of Fribourg (Switzerland), then managed and realized by the company Hengartner in Chur. 541 Ozone column data can now also be recorded with D51 in addition to the Umkehr measurements. 122 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) ments, Br72 542 was primarily taking Umkehr measurements and Br156 was run with emphasis on UV spectra. The measurement program of all three instruments was unified between 2008 and 2010 543. 9.1.3 Additional measurements The LKO was always considered as a privileged place for studies concerning the particular climate of alpine stations. The following section is devoted to the manifold measurements which were collected at the LKO, in addition to the stratospheric ozone measurements. Figure 47: Atmospheric measurements performed at Arosa between 1921 and 2017. Figure 47: At mospheric meas urements per for med at Ar os a bet ween 1921 and 2017. Figure 47 gives an overview of the measurements performed at Arosa, at the LKO platforms (see Figure 1 for the locations) and at Tschuggen 544 (Sect. 3.3.2), for longer periods and operated by the 542 Since November 2011 Br72 was run at Davos with the purpose of investigating the comparability between the two sites when con- sidering a relocation of the LKO from Arosa to Davos (St\u00fcbi et al., 2017a) (Sect. 8.2). 543 The Brewer spectrophotometers can be considered as a very valuable complement to guarantee the quality of the ozone observ a- tions at the LKO. However, as the Arosa series is based on the Dobsons spectrophotometers which are still the backbone of the GAW network, the report focusses mainly on the Dobson systems. 123 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Lig ht Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO LKO staff. The temporary measurements performed at Arosa by invited scientists and the observ a- tions made by persons of the LKO (G\u00f6tz and others) outside of Arosa are treated at the end of this section. 9.1.3.a) Radiation measurements The measurement of the direct component of solar radiation and the biologically active UV -B radi a- tion were part of the specific mandate of the KVV Arosa when the LKO started its act ivities in 1921 545. The measurement of these parameters continued, with some interruptions, almost through the entire history of the LKO. Biologically active UV -B radiation After recording of the UV -B radiation in the starting phase of the LKO 546, G\u00f6tz established a small network measuring the biologically active UV -B radiation in the 1930s with dosimeter instruments manufactured by I.G. Farbenindustrie (KVV Arosa Annual Report 1935), a de- velopment initiated by G\u00f6tz. Only much later UV -B measurements were resumed in Arosa. From 14 August 1992 to 15 June 1999 UVB radiation was registered at the LKO platform with instruments of different types (Macam, Robertson- Berger, Yankee and Kipp&Zonen); UV -B radiation has been con- tinuously measured at Tschuggen since 2 May 1995. Direct component of solar radiation and global radiation The direct component of the total solar radiation was measured at the LKO with a Michelsonactinometer , which was calibrated with silver disc pyrheliometers (in the first years on loan from Do rno and later from MeteoSwiss). The measurements of the first years from October 1921 to March 1925 were presented in the publication covering the radiation climate ofArosa (G\u00f6tz, 1926b). The measurements of the direct sun intensity were then continued foran extended duration beyond the starting period, as the intensity of the midday sun is givenfor the entire period lasting from 1927 to 1948 in the second book on Arosa's climate (G\u00f6tz,1954).This data supplemented the measurements of the global radiation collected with a Fuess - Robitzsch actinograph at the climatological station of MeteoSwiss at Arosa from 1901 to1939. Again, during the years 1944- 1947 global radiation has been registered in the fram e- work of the \"climatological action\" 547 (for more details refer to Section 3.6.4 of this report). After an interruption of more than 40 years, different radiation components were againmeasured at the LKO under the auspices of a program supervised by Atsumu Ohmura 548 from January 1990 to March 2007. The global radiation is also part of the automatic meteorological measurements installed atthe LKO platform since 1992 (for the LKO's own purposes). 544 Refer to footnote 98 on page 28. 545 For this reason, they are treated outside of the climatological parameters presented in Section 9.1.1.a. 546 Remember, that t he biologically active UV -B radiation was determined by G\u00f6tz from November 1921 to May 1923 with a Cadmium cell (on loan from Dorno; for details refer to Section 3.2) allowing for estimation of stratospheric ozone. 547 Refer to footnote 198 on page 41. 548 Refer to footnote 437 on page 89. 124 Scientific Report Met eoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) 9.1.3.b) Surface Ozone Here we provide additional information about the methods of the surface ozone measurements men- tioned in Section 3.5.2 (see Staehelin et al. 2017 for further information and present use of the measurements). G\u00f6tz performed optical measurements of the ozone content near the ground with a UV spectrograph and a mercury lamp installed at a certain distance (G\u00f6tz and Ladenburg, 1931). A letter (Ladenburg, 1 May 1931) and other documents found in the LKO Archives show that perfor m- ing chemical measurements as done in Montsouris 549 was also considered for Arosa at this time. But ultimately the long path method was preferred, the chemical method being considered as too compl i- cated and too uncertain. Surface ozone became again a topic of interest at the LKO in the context of the program aimed at the medical development of the resort areas (\"climatological action\" , refer to Section 3.6.4). First meas- urements were performed with the electrochemical method of Ehmert at the beginning of the 1950s (G\u00f6tz and Volz, 1951). Regular measurements of surface ozone were performed after the move in the Florentinum, covering 144 days from 29 April 1954 to 18 October 1958 at the LKO (Perl, 1965; Staehelin et al., 1994). According to the LKO activity report AR 1969 (KVVA, 1921- 1977), measur e- ments of surface ozone continued at Florentinum up to the end of the 1960s although little is known on the techniques used and the frequency of the measurements. At the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s (AR 1969- 1971), measurements are also mentioned at Tschuggen. During winter 1980/81 and summer 1981 surface ozone (as well as CO and NO x) was measured at different places in Arosa (Graber, 1984). Since the beginning of the 1990s, surface ozone is again continuously monitored with analyzers at the LKO platform and at Tschuggen with the goal of supplementing the total ozone and profile meas- urements with the ozone conditions near the ground 550. 9.1.3.c) A tmospheric Electricity In the framework of the \"climatological action\" , G\u00f6tz entered a cooperation with the University of Fribourg (Switzerland) in order to extend the investigation of the local climate conditions to atmos-pheric electricity. Under the direction of Dessauer 551 a program was started at the beginning of the 1950s comprising measurements of ion current and rapid pressure variations. These measurements were continued after the retirement of Dessauer in 1951 and G\u00f6tz's death in 1954. Leonhard Saxer and Werner Siegrist, both scientists of the University of Fribourg and later teachers of physics at the High School of Aarau 552, took over the responsibility of the investigations concerning atmospheric electricity. A special 3- year project, granted by the Swiss National Science Foundation, was started in 1956 in the context of the activities related to the IGY 553: The measur e- 549 At the Parc de Montsouris, near Paris, Albert L\u00e9vy conducted quantitative ozone measurements from 1876- 1910 (Calvert et al., 2015). 550 The measurements at the LKO are operated by Oekoscience (Chur) mandated by the Environment department of the Canton of Grisons (from summer 1991 to March 1996 the equipment was placed on the Florentinum platform, later on in a special hut on the LKO terrace). 551 Friedrich Dessauer (1881 -1963), Professor and Director of the Physics Institute of the University of Fribourg (1937- 1951). 552 Kantonsschule Aarau. 553 Refer to footnote 223 on page 45. 125 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO ments of the ion current were stopped whereas those of the rapid pressure variations maintained; in addition, measurements of potential gradient, vertical current density and conductivity became part of the program, and this not only on the LKO platform but also at Tschuggen (2050 m a.s.l.) and at the top of the Weisshorn (2650 m a.s.l.) (Saxer and Siegrist, 1961). The activities were discontinued at Tschuggen and at the Weisshorn after the IGY (probably in February 1960) but were maintained at the LKO for a while. In 1963, the program at the LKO was scaled back, maintaining only the recor d- ings of the potential gradient and of the rapid pressure variations. The registration of the atmospheric electricity parameters at the LKO platform was then completely suspended in 1966 for several years. According to Saxer (1983), atmospheric electricity parameters, mainly air conductivity and electric potential gradient were again registered at Tschuggen from 1973 onwards as a complement to the measurements performed at the lowland station established in Aarau in 1964 (Saxer and Siegrist, 1966; Saxer, 1983). These measurements, which were supervised by Saxer and Siegrist and sup-ported by the staff of the LKO, continued almost 30 years and were stopped on 3 September 1999 (in Aarau the data acquisition ended in 2002). 9.1.3.d) Miscellaneous measurements From the LKO activity report AR 1972 (KVVA, 1921- 1977) it turns out that fog measurements were performed at the Tschuggen at the beginning of the 1970s. In the same period, precipitation samples were collected at this place in order to determine the Strontium -90 content, presumably related to studies of the fallout originating from the high altitude nuclear explosions occurring mainly in the years 1958- 1962. Nothing is known about the originator and the users of these measurements. Primary air pollutant concentrations were continuously measured in the framework of the PhD theses of M. Campana (Campana et al., 2005) and Y. Li (Li et al., 2005) for more than a year at Tschuggen. 9.1.3.e) Air glow and Aurora observations As brought up earlier , G\u00f6tz was very much interested in all kinds of optical phenomena in the atmos- phere, especially those arising in the upper atmosphere (also emphasized in D\u00fctsch, 1992). The scientific motivations behind this curiosity are presented in Section 3.5.1. As can be seen from his public ation list ( Annex 2 ) many publications on halos, light pillars, air glow and auroras prove his great devotion to all these light phenomena. G\u00f6tz spent many nights during the second half of his career in the hut (buil t in 1934) at Tschuggen documenting as many interesting features as possible. 9.1.3.f) Snow measurements of the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF) Since the winter 1964/65, the LKO served as a reference station of the institute of snow and av a- lanche research (SLF) 554 of Davos. From the first snow of the winter up to the thaw period, a daily message (from winter 1997/98 onwards, 2 messages/day) of new and total snow amount were gen- erated at a fixed time. In the middle and at the end of the month a profile of the snow cover was es-tablished. In addition, observed avalanches were promptly reported. At the winter season 2015/16, the program has been considerably reduced, with only one determination of the new snow and total 554 Refer to footnote 190 on page 40 . 126 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) snow amount per day, measured not at fixed hours but at any time when the staff is present at the observatory. The snow observations for the SLF at the LKO were stopped after the winter season 2017/18. 9.1.3.g) Special observations at the LKO Arosa Because of its location and climate, Arosa was considered by many scientists as an ideal place to conduct atmospheric investigations and the LKO offered good infrastructure to support invited activ i- ties 555. As mentioned in Sect. 3.4, G\u00f6tz was networking very efficiently and was very open -minded about hosting invited guests in his house. Although the list is surely not exhaustive, Table 3 of this report gives an idea of the great number of scientists who often came with their proper instruments to per-form complementary studies at the LKO. Only few examples of the 1930s (not included in Figure 47), which G\u00f6tz explicitly emphasized in the LKO activity reports AR (KVVA, 1921- 1977), shall be men- tioned here: in addition to Peppler's balloon measurements 556, Schein and Stoll of the University of Z\u00fcrich started applying photomultipliers to atmospheric investigations at the LKO (G\u00f6tz et al., 1934b), Glawion examined Sahara dust events during a project of one and a half years (Glawion and G\u00f6tz, 1937, Glawion, 1937a, 1937b, and 1938) and Nicolet (Brussels) stayed for 6 months in Arosa to study the mechanism of excitation of the forbidden lines of oxygen and nitrogen in the spectra of the aurora and the night sky with the special spectrograph (Sect. 3.5.1) acquired in 1933 for the MeteoSwiss/ETH eras, the LKO continued to serve as measuring platform for the ozone community, mainly during the Dobson intercomparisons 557. In connection with the Umkehr measurements, Migeotte 558 came to Arosa in the years 1956- 1959 (IGY) to measure the vertical ozone distribution by means of infrared measurements, which were analyzed by Ernest Virgroux. Based on Migeotte's Air -Force contract, an intercomparison of four different methods for deter mining the vertical ozone distribution was held at Arosa in July -August 1958 559. Additional intercomparisons of the same type took place in 1961 (in conjunction with the Ozone Symposium) and 1962. In addition, research groups from Switzerland 560 and abroad 561 were regularly hosted at the LKO and at Tschuggen. 555 \"Invited activities\" meaning measurements performed by colleagues invited for special campaigns. 556 Peppler explored the wind circulation in the Arosa valley with pilot balloons (Sect. 3.5.2) (Peppler and G\u00f6tz, 1931). 557 Remember the international Dobson intercomparisons organized at LKO on behalf of WMO (Sect. 7.5, last Para.): 1978 (Sect. 5.3); 1986 (Sect. 6.2) as well as 1990, 1995 and 1999 (Sect. 7.3). Later on, Regional Brewer Calibrations Campaigns for Europe took place in 2008, 2010 as well as maintenance/calibration campaigns with the European Brewer Calibration Center (RBCC -E) traveling reference instrument in 2012, 2014 and 2016 (Sect. 7.3). 558 Marcel Migeotte (1912 -1992), PhD, astrophysicist, professor at the University of Li\u00e8ge (Belgium). 559 Indirect methods corresponding to infrared emission and absorption (Vigroux) and Umkehr (D\u00fctsch) were compared to direct met h- ods based on optical radiosondes (Paetzold) and chemical ozonesondes (Brewer). 560 E.g. Ozone profile measurements with a microwave radiometer were made by Hans -J\u00fcrg Jost of the Applied Physics group of the University of Bern in 1989; from 15 July 1999 to 10 October 2000, a sun photometer was installed at the LKO by Alain Heimo of Meteo- Swiss in the framework of the CHARM project of the Swiss GAW -CH Programme. 127 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO 9.1.3.h) G\u00f6tz 's scientific measurement campaigns outside of Arosa Besides the broad list of fields covered by G\u00f6tz at Arosa (at the LKO platform and at Tschuggen) it should be mentioned here that G\u00f6tz extended his observational activities to being involved in pr o- jects with measurement programs at sites other than Arosa. It would go too far to enter in the details of all these various campaigns , but the list of his publications (Annex 2 ) gives an idea concerning all the different studies G\u00f6tz initiated or participated in, outside of Arosa. A few examples shall be men- tioned here: In the 1920s, G\u00f6tz was involved in a project of Dorno in performing radiation measur e- ments at Muottas -Muraigl in the Engadin (Dorno, 1927b). In this period, he also provided some sup- port to Alfred Gockel 562 concerning radiation measurements in Montana (Switzerland) (Gockel, 19 September 1926 and 2 February 1927). A grant attributed by the IUGG in 1933 enabled the study of surface ozone conditions at Jungfraujoch and Lauterbrunnen in collaboration with Chalonge and Vassy and with the support of cand. phys. Maier -Leibnitz (Chalonge et al., 1934, G\u00f6tz and Maier - Leibnitz, 1933). Observations with Dobson spectrophotometers at Jungfraujoch and Lauterbrunnen in the 1930s (in collaboration with Dobson) are mentioned in the AR 1934 (KVVA, 1921- 1977); the results were submitted to W OUDC. Followi ng the tests with UV -dosimeters 563 at the LKO, G\u00f6tz es- tablished a small network comprising the sites of Arosa, Chur, Z\u00fcrich and Jungfraujoch allowing the comparison between the different locations in Switzerland (G\u00f6tz und Kreis, 1937); this happened in collaboration with Alfred Kreis 564 who supported G\u00f6tz in many other investigations 565. The expedi- tions complete the picture of these activities engaged outside of Arosa: besides the Svalbard expedi-tion (Sect. 3.8) G\u00f6tz participated in 1930 in an aircraft expedition to Iceland 566 (G\u00f6tz, 1930) and in 1936 he made a trip to Tripoli 567 (G\u00f6tz, 1936; D\u00fctsch, 1992). Personnel 9.2 During the existence of the LKO, more than 170 persons participated in the operation and analysis of the measurements summarized above (Sect. 9.1). In the following, an overview of the persons who played a role in the destiny of the LKO will be presented thereby distinguishing the specific aspects related to the operational and management tasks (Sect. 9.2.1 and 9.2.2) and the scientific activities (Sect. 9.2.3). An important concern of this part is also to give credit to all the persons involved in the guidance, performance and enhancement of the measurements at the LKO for their conscientious and qualitatively convincing work. 561 E.g. the Max Planck Institute of Chemistry from Mainz (Johnsons, Arlander, Parchatka and Bergens as well as Roth and Kl\u00fcpfel) performed measurements for almost half a year, from 4 November 1991 to 8 April 1992, at Tschuggen and at the Obersee in Arosa. 562 Alfred Gockel (1860 -1927), PhD, Professor at the Physics Department o f the University of Fribourg (Switzerland), Director of the Institute of Cosmic Physics. 563 Produced by I.G. Farbenindustrie Aktiengesellschaft, Ludwigshafen. 564 Alfred Kreis ( 1885- teacher at the Academic High School of Chur (Switzerland), honorary doctor of ETH Z\u00fcrich. 565 Among others, G\u00f6tz and Kreis followed the stratospheric flight of August Piccard on 18 August 1932 with theodolites from the ground (Ganz et al., 1932). 566 From 16 July to 18 July 1930, G\u00f6tz had the opportunity to participate to the first expedition of the airship \"Graf Zeppelin\" to Iceland; in around 60 hours the airship went from Friedrichshafen over Hamburg to Bergen, then crossing the sea to the eastern side of Iceland, longing the souths coast of Iceland until Reikjavik; the airship flew back on the Atlantic sea to the western coast of France (Nantes) and back to F riedrichshafen. It is amazing to note that one of the others guests on board was Umberto Nobile whose hut G\u00f6tz occupied during his expedition in Svalbard (Sect. 3.8). 567 To describe the course of the total solar eclipse which occurred on 19 June 1936. 128 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) 9.2.1 Operation 9.2.1.a) Measurement and operational tasks during the G\u00f6tz period From 1921 to 1944, G\u00f6tz was mostly working alone and most of the long observational records of the LKO were taken by himself (for more details concerning this period refer to Chapter 3 of this report). Only occasionally did he have some help from other persons (see T able 12). In the first two years of the measurements with the F\u00e9ry instrument of Dobson (1926- 27) he noted that he had to reduce his holidays in order to continuously ensure reliable measurements in Arosa, performed at first in the framework of the European measuring project 568 initiated by Dobson. As stated in the annual reports of the KVV Arosa, (AR 1926/27) he had the opportunity to hire a university assistant in 1927 (NN. Ferenez 569) to replace him during the weeks he was on a study trip in Holland and England. During his expedition to Svalbard in 1929 he was accompanied by Emil Henssler who had previously worked as an observer of the climatological station of MeteoSwiss in Arosa. It can be assumed that from 1921 to 1926 570 the observer(s) of the MeteoSwiss station (Sect. 9.1.1) probably also provided some assistance to G\u00f6tz in accomplishing the measurements of the LKO. As described in Section 3.6.4, G\u00f6tz referred several times in the activity reports, as e.g. in AR 1938/39 (KVVA, 1921- 1977), to the high work load he was facing and complained about the lack of assistants. Cand. phys. Z\u00fcnti (G\u00f6tz, 1938) is the only person cited in the activity reports or in any other documents 571 as having assisted him in this period with the ozone measurements. Nevertheless, although no concrete proof could be found, it can be taken for granted that G\u00f6tz had some assistance in performing total ozone observations in the 1930s. This can be judged from the large number of days with direct sun observations in Arosa in some years (see Table 10 in Sect. 9.1.2.b) and Table 1 in Staehelin et al. 1998a). This would mean that measurements had to be taken on most fair days, while G\u00f6tz needed to teach once per week during academic semesters in Z\u00fcrich (Sect . 3.9) and was regularly travelling to conferences (Sect. 3.4). This se ems to be confirmed by a remark in the activity survey 1935- 1938 (G\u00f6tz, 1938) 572, where it is noted that in the absence of permanent collaborators , he was dependent on the help of some occasional auxiliary persons (not cited by name) 573. In this decade, G\u00f6tz invited a large number of scientists to Arosa in order to perform measurements at the LKO for weeks or even months (Sect. 9.1.3.g) . The annual report AR 1939 mentions 25 visiting scientists. It is reasonable to consider that these visitors helped G\u00f6tz to overcome the shortages in manpower during this period in some way. 568 Refer to footnote 237 on page 50. 569 First name not known. 570 After 1926, the climatological station was run by G\u00f6tz. 571 Cand. phys. Maier -Leibnitz (from G\u00f6ttingen) was hired in 1936 on a project concerning surface ozone at Jungfraujoch (Sect. 9.1.3.h) . 572 Addressed to the Society of Natural Sciences of the Grisons . 573 As Margarethe G\u00f6tz, the wife of G\u00f6tz, was involved in the observational program of the meteorological station of MeteoSwiss in Arosa (Sect. 3.11) we might speculate that she also assisted him occasionally in the ozone activities of the LKO (although this is not clearly stated in any document). 129 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longes t atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO It was only in the 1940s that G\u00f6tz applied intensively for grants 574 allowing him to hire a series of collaborators (as can be seen from Table 16 in Sect. 9.2.3). These collaborators were mainly i n- volved in projects or particular studies, but at least with Perl it is clearly known that she also partici- pated in the regular ozone measurements.

It seems that she was alone in the two first years at Florentinum (1955- 1956) to cover all the observational tasks; at least no persons supporting Perl can be found in any document. When D\u00fctsch started the Umkehr program (Sect. 4.2 and 5.1) in Arosa in 1956, students were employed and specifically trained (one or two students at once) to perform these tedious and time- consuming measurements as they require mainly cloud free conditions starting before sunrise 575. They stayed at Arosa usually for several (generally 3- 6) months. As can be learned in a letter from D\u00fctsch to Tschudi 576 (D\u00fctsch, 5 June 1962), the students working for the Umkehr program were also employed in providing some assistance in the routine work of the LKO; they conducted total ozone measurements, particularly over the weekend, to relieve the ob- server. 9.2.1.b) Local operational responsibility after 1962 When Perl left Arosa in spring 1962 (Sect. 4.2) Oswald Frick 577, a technician, was hired on 1 May 1962 as local station manager and observer to perform and analyze the measurements. Frick died on 5 January 1964 after having worked for 13 months at the LKO. Subsequently, Rosmarie Frick (the widow of Oswald Frick) ran the LKO from January until 30 September 1964 578.

Obergfell, \"who did their work carefully under not always agreeable conditions (very low tempe r- atures in winter; very early start of work in summer)\". 576 Refer to footnote 359 on page 73. 577 Oswald Frick (1930- 1964), station manager of the LKO (1962 -1963), was previously working for an extended time at the PMOD under M\u00f6rikofer. 578 To all appearances Rosemarie Frick was mainly involved in mapping Umkehr curves; it must therefore be assumed that the meas- urement work was mostly performed by the students during this period. 131 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO Kurt Aeschbacher (see Figure 48) deserves a special mention with regard to the long time he was in charge of the operational responsibility of the LKO. His work is viewed by the authors of the report to be essential for obtaining the extraordinary high quality of the stratospheric ozone measurements required for reliable long- term trend analysis. From 1959 to 1964, he worked at the PMOD in Davos as technical coworker before he joined the LKO in Arosa on 1 October 1964. He was first hired by the KVV Arosa and worked as station manager under the scientific leadership of D\u00fctsch. According Aeschbacher, he obtained his first training to perform the measurements from students when D\u00fctsch was not present 579. In 1973, when the LKO moved to the Haus Steinbruch, Aeschbacher was sal a- ried by IACETH 580. Since the move to the Haus Steinbruch he stayed with his family 581 in the service apartment which was just under the platform of the observatory; this was important in order to more easily perform the Umkehr measurements , which were done manually until 1989 on cloudless days. Students continued to be employed at the LKO to assist the station manager, primarily to perform the Umkehr measurements but also to replace the station manager during weekends and holidays as before. Aeschbacher was responsible to initiate and train the 81 students 582 who spent several months for observing work in Arosa at the LKO between 1964 and 1988 (a list of the names of all these students is given in Table 13). It is his merit having been able to train and motivate these young people and to enable them to provide high quality data. In the later time, he was assisted i n- creasingly by Schill 583 when automation was becoming more and more important. On 1 January 1988, he became an employee of MeteoSwiss. At that time, a new operational solution was introduced with three part time auxiliary assistants as backup for the station manager during weekends and holidays instead of the students. By this way the employment periods were longer , thus bringing more experience and a greater stability, although a certain rotation of the personnel involved could not be avoided 584. The names of the 15 part -time observers (20- 30%) who were wor k- ing at the LKO in the period 1988- 2014 are listed in Table 12. Aeschbacher was also very important in the large international instrumental ozone intercomparison campaigns taking place at the LKO (Sect. 5.3, 6.2 and 7.3). Aeschbacher retired in November 2001 after more than 37 years of service at the LKO in Arosa. Rudolf Burren 585 replaced Aeschbacher as station manager. He started to work at the LKO on early September 2001 and during a three month overlap he was introduced by Aeschbacher to all the tasks of the observatory. When Rudolf Burren died in 2011, Werner Siegrist succeeded as the local responsible observer. 579 During this period, D\u00fctsch was employed in Boulder and visited Arosa only occas ionally (during holiday s) (Sect. 5.2). 580 Refer to footnote 12 on page 4. 581 R\u00f6sli Aeschbacher, his wife, was in contact with Margarethe G\u00f6tz, the widow of G\u00f6tz, taking care of her in the last years of her life; she provided much of the information presented in Appendix 1. 582 Most of these students served only once at the LKO. Herbert Schill, nowadays station scientist at the LKO, began as one of these students and was engaged eight times in the years from 1977 to 1982. 583 Refer to Section 9.2.3 and to footnote 582 on 131. 584 T he average employment time of an assistant was approximately 5.5 years. 585 Rudolf Burren (1950 -2011), station manager of the LKO (2001- 2011), previously the responsible technician at the Hotel Tschuggen Arosa. 132 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) Tabl e 13: From N ovember 1964 t o J ul y 1988, 81 st udents (corr espondi ng t o 115 tenur es) assist ed t he local s tation manager ( names pr ovided by Aeschbacher).

In the MeteoSwiss period the responsibilities were di- vided; thus , these functions will be presented distinctively in the following. 9.2.2.a) Administrative management During the period he was active at the LKO (1921- 1954), G\u00f6tz not only took most of the long obser- vational records by himself (for more details see Section above) but also assumed all the manage- ment functions related to the operation of the observatory, preparing the working plans, reporting to the KVV Arosa on the activities of the LKO and presenting the annual cost statements (see Figure 50 in Section 9.3.1.a) . From 1954 to 1962, Perl covered these activities as G\u00f6tz's successor (Sect. 4.2). After Perl left Arosa, the LKO administrative supervision of the LKO was assumed entirely by D\u00fctsch, with the assistance of the station managers handling the local conditions. It is interesting to note that this was also the beginning of a new era where the leading persons were no longer personally i n- volved in taking measurements and no longer resident at Arosa.

However, the correspondence with Dobson as well as the exchange with the company Schmidt -Haensch concerning the development of the Arosa Spectrograph reveal that G\u00f6tz pos-135 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the L KO sessed a solid experimental background enabling him to face the technical problems mostly alone. Occasionally, he had the support from the technical service of the University of Z\u00fcrich. More critical problems were addressed with Dobson's help 586. During the D\u00fctsch period, at least from 1973 onwards, the LKO was part of the IACETH. The inst i- tute's infrastructure could therefore be used for technical assistance and repairs. Donat Hoegl, a technician of IACETH, was helping to cover the maintenance and development works in order to face instrumental problems of the spectrophotometers used. D\u00fctsch was quite aware of the instrumental problems as he was applying the statistical Langley plot to the measurements series of Arosa by himself (Sect. 5.2, 7.4.1 and 7.5). He was very much concerned with assuring a high data availability; with the purchase of the Dobson spectrophotometer D101 in 1966, a complete redundancy for both the direct sun (total ozone) and the zenith sky (Umkehr measurements) was implemented. In 1975, he started a project aiming to perform automated measurements with the instrument D51 587. Tabl e 15: P ersons i nvol ved i n t he t ec hnic al management of the LK O.

The technical responsibility was as- sumed since then by different persons as can be seen from Table 15. 586 This was the case when the F\u00e9ry spectrograph Nr. 2 (\"D2\") was damaged during the Svalbard expedition and had to be refurbished in Oxford (Sect. 3.8 and 9.1.2.b) . 587 First for the direct sun (total ozone) and in 1985 for zenith sky (Umkehr) observations (Sect. 9.1.2.b) . The development was finally brought to operational maturit y by MeteoSwiss. 136 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) Based on a cooperation agreement between MeteoSwiss and the Institute of Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF) in Davos, the maintenance tasks of the technical systems at the LKO were acco m- plished by collaborators of this institute from 1994 onwards (see Table 15). But several collaborators from the Measurement Techniques division of MeteoSwiss in Payerne were also involved in the i n- stallation, maintenance and repair as well as technical upgrading work (see Table 15). Two automation steps 588 were realized by the Measurements Techniques division: Hoegger was the linchpin of the large technical renewal of the LKO in 1986- 1989, which r e- sulted in completely automated Umkehr and semi -automated total ozone measurements. This enabled an increase in the number of total ozone observations per day and ensured the optimal number of Umkehr observations because of easier operating conditions. The redun-dancy was also considerably reinforced in the 1990s with the introduction of the automated Brewer systems. The full automation of all Dobson systems occurring between 2011 and 2015 was realized at the initiative of Calpini with St\u00fcbi 589 as project leader. This again brought a quantum leap as now direct sun and zenith sky measurements could be performed quasi -simultaneously with each system at different wavelengths and the total ozone could be measured in a very st a- ble mode at a much higher frequency 590. 9.2.3 Scientific activities The impressive publication list of G\u00f6tz ( Annex 2 ) shows that he was scientifically very productive and assumed the scientific leadership in a very comprehensive manner during the entire time he was active at the LKO (Sect. 3.10). The Perl period was much shorter and only a few publications based on her LKO activities are available ( Annex 3 ). Under the scientific leadership of D\u00fctsch, the LKO not only survived in the uncertain times following G\u00f6tz's death but regained a leading role in ozone research (Chapt. 5). In 1988, Staehelin started to contribute to ozone research at IACETH and made sure that the world's longest ozone series at Arosa could make a valuable contribution to the debate on the anthropogenic ozone depletion (Sect. 7.6.2). For more than 27 years (from April 1988 to August 2014) he acted as scientific advisor of MeteoSwiss; his contribution to SAG -Ozone (Sect. 7.5) can also be viewed as a contribution to QA/QC. Altogether eleven PhDs dedicated to the ozone measurements of Arosa were completed (one under the lead of G\u00f6tz at the University of Z\u00fcrich, four under the supervision of D\u00fctsch and seven under the 588 Details for the different instruments are given in Section 9.1.2.b . 589 Refer to footnote 495 on page 109. 590 However, the switch from direct sun to zenith sky measurements (or back) still needs manual interaction (setting/removing of the ground quartz plate and the sundirector). 137 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's lo ngest atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO Tabl e 16: Sci entists i nvol ved wit h the acti vi ties and t he dat a of the LKO.

In addition, there were also quite a number of diploma theses accomplished (number not known). MeteoSwiss was also supporting the ozone measurements in Arosa (and Payerne) at the scientific level since 1994 (as part of the Swiss GAW Programme). Several persons were/are concerned (see Table 16): St\u00fcbi and Maillard were covering a broad spectrum of activities including QA/QC as well as data processing and analyses. St\u00fcbi was leading the automation project of the Dobson i n- strument and is strongly involved in the planning of the move of the LKO from Arosa to D a- vos (for more details refer to Section 8.2). Maillard contributed to the processing and anal y- sis of the Umkehr measurements as well as of the ozone profile measurements performed with the microwave radiometer SOMORA at the Aerological Station in Payerne (Sect. 7.6.1). Schill, already involved as a student and assistant of D\u00fctsch at the LKO between 1977 and 1982 (see Table 13 and refer to footnote 582 on page 131 ), worked at the LKO on mandates from MeteoSwiss from 1987 to 2002 (especially accompanying the station staff during the phase of introduction of computer based processes as well as on QC and data handling problems ) and was hired by MeteoSwiss as (part -time) station scientist in 2002. Specific contributions were accomplished by Giroud and Bugnion in 1995- 1996 investigating and classifying the LKO Archives concerning the total ozone and Umkehr data of Arosa stored in Payerne. Budget 9.3 In this section, the budget of the LKO during the entire duration is presented. For some specific per i- ods detailed information was available whereas for others some approximate estimates were r e- quired. In Section 9.3.1, the expenses related to the operation of the LKO over the entire period have been compiled. Whereas in Section 9.3.1.a) the values are given as nominal numbers in Swiss Francs (CHF) including charges as practiced in the successive periods (see Table 17), an attempt is made in Section 9.3.1.b) to present a consistent overview on the evolution of the costs of the LKO based on numbers corrected for inflation to allow a direct comparison of the expenses in the different pha s- es 594. In Section 9.3.2, the means devoted to scientific activities (including QA/QC, analysis and research) are estimated. These numbers might be more questionable as less direct information was available and therefore additional assumptions were required. Nevertheless, they are believed to provide valuable estimates for the efforts made on scientific work throughout the lifetime of the LKO. 591 Note that only those PhD's accomplished with D\u00fctsch and Staehelin at LAPETH resp. IACETH are listed here which were in close connection to LKO or with financial support from GAW -CH. 592 R efer to footnote 12 on page 4. 593 F or the names see Table 16 and for the titles see the References. 594 Following common terminology, we use here \"nominal\" for the values in the currency used at the time and \"real\" for values adj usted for inflatio n. 139 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO 9.3.1 Operational costs 9.3.1.a) Operational budget based on nominal values From the outset to the early 1930s, the KVV Arosa was the only institution supporting the LKO based on an annual budget 595. At the very beginning, the study of the climatological conditions of Arosa was planned for a short period 596 and the budget was rather modest. The costs for the first 6 months amounted to 1,563 CHF; the budget for the first full financial year was of 4,000 CHF. In the first years, when the LKO was located at the Sanatorium Arosa (see Sect. 3.1 and Figure 1), we might assume that no cost was required for renting rooms. After 1926, when the LKO moved to G\u00f6tz's own house (Villa Firnelicht), the continuation of the activity of the LKO was considered on a longer time scale and the budget was increased significantly. As can be seen from Figure 49, the KVV Arosa paid during the period 1924- 1930 on average 8,000 CHF/y in order to support the core program of the measurements, including total ozone and radiation measurements 597. Tabl e 17: A ppr oxi mated c harges applied to t he st aff costs ( a si mplified sc heme is used). Table 17: Approximated charges applied to the staff costs (a simplified scheme is used). Period Years Social contributions Overhead costs the second decade, beginning in 1932 598, the Railway Company Chur -Arosa 599 began to support the activities of the LKO, first with approximately 2,500 CHF/y in the 1930s and then with 4,000 CHF/y in the 1940s. At the same time the community of Arosa also started contribut ing on a regu- lar 600 basis with 2,000 CHF/y. The yearly spending of the LKO therefore grew on average to roughly 12,500 CHF/y during the decade 1932- 1940. 595 As mentioned in Section 3.4, budget information could be found in the annexes of the annual reports of the Kur - und Verkehrsverein Arosa which were published annually (KVVA, 1921- 1977). 596 I nitially for one year, extend ed in December 1922 as can be concluded from comments in the correspondence Dorno -G\u00f6tz of 27 and 30 December 1922. 597 This contribution represented about 2.8% of the mean annual budget (291,334 CHF) of the KVV Arosa in the years 1924-1929. 598 The Annual Reports of the KVV Arosa for 1930- 1933 are missing (Sect. 3.4). 599 Refer to footnote 157 on page 37. 600 Note that \"regular sponsor\" covers different types of sponsors that allowed to finance the operational measurements excluding specific re search proposals. 140 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) 05'00010'00015'00020'00025'00030'00035'00040'000 1922 1932 1942 1952 1962 1972Nominal yearly expenses in CHF YearLKO Budget Grants USA ETHZ aeteoSwiss Swiss Nat.

At the beginning of World War II, the KVV Arosa as well as Rhaetian Railway Company reduced their funding intermittently and the budget of the LKO dropped down to lower levels during the first years of the war (approximately CHF 10'000 in 1940), which seriously threatened the activities of the LKO 601. For the period 1944- 1953, the values of the budget are derived from the detailed monthly accounts of the LKO expenses (see Figure 50) as submitted by G\u00f6tz to the KVV Arosa 602. Figure 51 gives an overview of the size of the different budget items, as defined by G\u00f6tz, based on averaged monthly values for the last 10 years of G\u00f6tz's working life. In this period, the operating budget (mainly dedicated to running costs) covered by the \"regular sponsors\" amounted on average to 13,900 CHF/y 603. 601 Remember that G\u00f6tz seriously considered leaving Arosa around 1940 (Sect. 3.6.3 ). 602 F ound in the LKO Archives. 603 Note that the expenses concerning externally financed project staff (grants) are not included in this cost breakdown, they are part of the scientific means (Sect. 9.3.2). 141 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO Figure 50: Expenses of the LKO in December 1946.

During these years, G\u00f6tz's salary represented approximately \u00be of the regular budget; the part includ- ing salary as well as the rent of the observatory rooms corresponded to nearly 90%. No investments are specified during the whole period 1944- 1953. The 3% expenses for \" study costs \" 604 paid on the regular budget are very low and correspond exclusively to expenditures such as paper, pencils and stamps; they do not include the time G\u00f6tz needed to analyze and publish the results of his r e- search 605. It is interesting to follow the evolution of the salary of G\u00f6tz during his career at the LKO. In the first year, it must have been no more than 330 CHF/m. It can be established that the salary part of the budget was 660 CHF/m in 1944. The last monthly settlements from October 1953 indicate that the salary component reached 915 CHF/m in the last year before death; this is still rather modest keep- ing in mind his extraordinary efforts (Sect. 3.10) 606. When it became clear in 1953 that G\u00f6tz, who was seriously handicapped since 1951- 1952 (Sect. 3.11), would not recover from his illness and could no longer sustain the operational meas- urements, a pension was awarded by the KVV Arosa to him and his wife. This explains the higher level of the budget in 1954 and the following years (see Figure 49). Furthermore, a solution had to be 604 G\u00f6tz called this Studienkosten \". 605 As shown in Chapter 3, G\u00f6tz was a very productive scientist. 606 This corresponded to annual salaries of 4,000 (1922), 7,920 (1944) and 10,980 (1953) CHF/y in nominal values. When adjusted for inflation (real values), annual incomes of respectively 27,000, 43,000 and 54,000 CHF/y would guarantee the same purchasing power in 2015 (Consumer price index ( Konsumentenpreisindex KPI)). But taking in to account the wage index ( Historischer Lohnindex HLI) instead of the consumer price index, this would rather correspond to wages of respectively 59,000, 105,000 and 109,000 CHF/y in 2015 (both indices according to Swistoval, www.swistoval.ch , state of 14 January 2019 (Pfister and Studer, 2019)) (Information made available by Tobias Straumann, Professor of Economic History of the University of Z\u00fcrich). Thus, the increase of salary between 1922 and 1944 was quite significant, but the values were still modest compared to actual wages. 0100200300400500600700800900Mean monthly expneses in CHF Budget items LKO Detailed expenses 1944 - 1953 Salary Rent Rooms General expenses Maintenance / Reparation Study costs Travel MeterologicalStation143 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of t he LKO found for the continuation of the LKO (Sect. 3.11 and Sect. 4.2). During this period, the SNSF made an important contribution to allow continuation of the measurements of the LKO, deciding at the r e- quest of MeteoSwiss 607 to support the LKO with 5,000 CHF/y for three years, thereby allowing Perl, who had been G\u00f6tz's assistant since 1948, to be paid a salary. Prior to this she had been funded with external grants 608. At the end of G\u00f6tz's career the long- term continuation of the LKO became very uncertain 609. As pres- ident of the committee for the Swiss activities of the IGY 610, Jean Lugeon 611 was greatly interested by the prospect that ozone measurements from the LKO could be part of the Swiss contribution to the IGY and arranged financial funding (10,000 CHF/y beginning in 1956) from the budget of Meteo-Swiss for the operation of the LKO before and during IGY. The support by MeteoSwiss was crucial as from 1953 onward the Rhaetian Railway Company began to gradually reduce its funding 612; it completely stopped in 1958. This funding was partly replaced by financial support from the Canton of Grisons of 1,000 CHF/y beginning in 1954, while the subsidizing of 2,000 CHF/y by the community of Arosa was still ongoing. MeteoSwiss did not abandon the financing of the LKO after the IGY and its financial contribution was maintained at the same level up to 1973 when ETH Z\u00fcrich took over com- plete financial responsibility for the LKO. The ozone profile measurements with the Umkehr method introduced by D\u00fctsch in 1956 into the observational program of the LKO were first based on US grants 613. Although the precise amount of these grants is not known, it can be reasonably assumed that they must have been in the order of 8,000 - 10,000 CHF/y enabling him to finance the assistance from the students 614 throughout these years (Sect 9.2.1.a) . These new resources were important to guarantee the continuation of the activ i- ties in the uncertain times after the death of G\u00f6tz. As Perl had to leave Arosa in 1962, D\u00fctsch undertook the scientific leadership of the LKO (Sect. 4.2) and assumed full responsibility for the LKO in 1965 when he became professor at ETH Z\u00fcrich. At first there were no significant changes in the funding of the LKO (Sect. 5.2). The main support still came from MeteoSwiss (10,000 CHF/y). The funding of the KVV Arosa (5,000 CHF/y on average), the community of Arosa (2,000 CHF/y) and the canton (1,000 CHF/y) were also continued. Financial contributions of ETH Z\u00fcrich appear in the accounts of the annual reports of the KVV Arosa from 1968 onwar ds, with 5,000 CHF/y on average in the following years, thus allowing the budget of the LKO to reach 24,000 - 27,000 CHF/y in the years 1968- 1972. When the US grants ceased in 1965, the st u- dents were paid out of the regular LKO budget and SNSF grants. The complete financial integration of the LKO in ETH Z\u00fcrich was only achieved in 1973 when the LKO moved to the Haus Steinbruch (Sect. 5.3). The budget situation then evolved in the following 607 Minutes from the meeting of the Federal Meteorological Commission (Eidgen\u00f6ssische Meteorologische Kommission, EMK ) of 27 March 1953. 608 The SNSF support is here included as \"regular sponsor\" as its support for salary of Perl allowed continuation of regular ozone observations . 609 In December 1953, the KVV Arosa agreed to extend its financial contribution for only three more years. 610 Refer to 223 on page 45. 611 Refer to 126 on page 34. 612 From 4,000 CHF/y before 1954, the funding dropped to 2,000 CHF/y in 1957. 613 Grants from the US Air Force (1956 -59, 1961- 1963) an d later from the National Center of Atmospheric Research (NACR) (1963- 65); refer also to Section 5.1). 614 One or two students at a time hired on a 3 -6 months -basis. 144 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) way: the Canton of Grisons stopped its contribution in 1974, while the community of Arosa and the KVV Arosa continued to support the LKO until 1977, the first maintaining its contribution of 2,000 CHF/y and the second reducing the amount to 2,000 CHF/y. Thereafter, the costs of the LKO were (formally) covered by the budget of IACETH. Despite rather sparse information available for this period, the annual costs of the LKO paid on the budget of ETH in 1980, can be estimated to be in the order of 130 kCHF/y (see Table 18). The main contributions were the salaries (71 kCHF/y) and the rent of the platform as well as the apartments and the office rooms in the Haus Steinbruch (49 KCHF/y) 615. The mean annual operational costs (nominal) grew to averaged levels of roughly 400 kCHF/y (Viatte, 2001; Ruffieux, 2011 and 2016) in the decades 1995 -2015 616 when MeteoSwiss was fully in charge of the LKO, as can be seen from Table 18. The renewal and upgrading of the technical equipment (Sect. 7.3) generated considerable investment (amortization) costs 617. Furthermore, the technical maintenance was now carried out by a technical group from the Institute for Snow and Aval anche Research 618 in Davos, paid from the MeteoSwiss instrumental budget (Sect. 9.2.2.b) . In addition, the operation of the measurements was organized with the assistance of salaried employees (instead of students on a more or less volunteer basis) (Sect. 7.3 and 9.2.1.b) , which represents a remarkable financial charge when taking into account the performance specifications with extended working hours on a daily basis (week -ends included).

In real values, the rent costs were approximately 10,000 CHF/y in 1950 (Firnelicht), 7,000 CHF/y in 1965 (Florentinum) and 90,000 CHF/y in 1980 (Steinbruch). 616 Concerning the averaged value of the decade 1986- 1995 in Table 18, it must be taken into account that this corresponds to the period where the transition from ETH Z\u00fcrich to MeteoSwiss took place. 617 With respect to the estimated investment costs of about 625 kCHF for this renewal (including the acquisition of the three Brewer systems), an amortization of 25 kCHF per year for 25 years has been taken into account. 618 Refer to footnote 190 on page 40. 145 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world' s longest atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO 9.3.1.b) Evolution of operational budget based on real values For an appropriate overview of the evolution of the costs of the LKO (covered by the \" regular spon- sors\") over the whole duration it is necessary to compare real values, i.e. values after adjustment for inflation 619. The inflation- adjusted values, averaged over 10 year periods, are shown in Table 18 and Figure 51. Three distinct cost levels corresponding to the different periods (G\u00f6tz KVV Arosa, D\u00fctsch ETHZ 620 and MeteoSwiss/ETHZ) can clearly be distinguished.

For 2015, t he value of this partic ular year is s hown. In the first 50 years, the real costs (inflation- adjusted) were approximately 70 kCHF/y on average (see Figure 52) 621. As pointed out in Section 3.4, in this period the LKO under G\u00f6tz can be viewed as a one- man research company, with continuous but rather modest support mainly from the KVV Aros a (and other \"regular sponsors\" 622). Only in one exceptional case were costs required for instrument a- tion (Arosa ultraviolet spectrograph see Section 9.1.2.a) ; the rest of the time G\u00f6tz used spectropho- tometers made available by Dobson (Sect. 3.7 and 9.1.2.b) . He clearly performed nearly all of the observations with Dobson spectrophotometers and other instruments himself, at least in the 1920s 619 This has been completed based on the Swiss consumer price index (annual average, base being December 2015 = 100) published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Bundesamt f\u00fcr Statistik (BFS)) Neuch\u00e2tel (Switzerland). 620 Corresponding to the period after move of the LKO into the Haus Steinbruch. 621 It has to be noted that the peak in terms of buying power observed in the decade 1935 (1931 -1940) seems to be accentuated by the inflation adjustment (deflation). 622 Note that the \"regular sponsors\" also supplied G\u00f6tz's income for the time which he devoted to the analysis of the measurements as well as to the many publications and attendance of conferences and meetings ( see Table 4 in Section 3.4 ). Therefore only 70 % of the support of the \"regular sponsors\" were attributed to the operational costs whereas 30% were attributed to research and public ation. 050100150200250300350400450500 1925 1935 1945 1955 1965 1975 1985 1995 2005 2015Mean annual nominal and real expenses averaged per decade kCHF/y Year center of decade LKO Operational Costs KVV / ETHZ 146 Scientific MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Clim ate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) and 1930s; it was only in the late 1940s that he could benefit from the support of young scientists 623 who also helped with the operational measurements . His salary and the income from renting rooms 624 in Villa Firnelicht were rather small (see Figure 51). During the period in which the operational costs of the LKO were fully covered by ETH Z\u00fcrich, i.e. after the move to the Haus Steinbruch in 1973, the real (inflation- adjusted) value of the annual budg- et was in the order of 240 kCHF/y (see Table 18 625). The increase in expenses compared to the former period is clearly visible, even if strongly attenuated by the inflation adjustment. The raise was partly due to the higher salary of the professional observer as the station manager was now paid with ETH r emuneration, important for the long- term perspective. Furthermore, the market price was now paid for the observatory rooms as the Haus Steinbruch was a private building; the rent was therefore significantly higher than in the previous periods 626. As the working conditions at Florentinum were very difficult it was an important step for the LKO to move to the Haus Steinbruch, which offered a working environment for the employees in charge of the measurements corresponding to modern standards. When MeteoSwiss took over responsibility for the LKO in 1988, reliable ozone trend determination became of particular interest. As the long- term ozone evolution related to the MP and its strengthen- ing's was more and more in the focus (see Figure 34), the requirements concerning long- term stabi l- ity of the ozone measurements were higher than in earlier times (Sect. 7.1). MeteoSwiss addressed this challenge by consolidating the infrastructure and upgrading the measurement capabilities, by professionalizing the maintenance services and by reinforcing the operational staff. This correspond-ed to a financial commitment which had never been made before and explains the jump of the e x- penses visible in Figure 52 (compared to the previous periods) with the annual operational real costs of the LKO in inflation- adjusted terms rising on average as high as 420 kCHF/y 627 in the years 1995 to 2015 628. 9.3.2 S cientific financial resources The purpose of this section is to estimate the financial resources dedicated to scientific work and value- added activities concerning the data gathered at the LKO (and at Tschuggen) during the differ- ent periods. The amount of support for scientific work is of a different nature compared to the oper a- tional costs described in Section 9.3.1. Here we included both QA/QC activities allowing enhanc e- ment of the potential of the measurements for data analysis as well as scientific studies aimed at getting articles published in peer reviewed journals. The latter might be viewed as a sort of indicator 623 Engaged on external research grants (not shown in the cost breakdown of Figure 51). 624 Refer to footnote 615 on page 144. 625 The decade 1976 -1985 gives the most representative value. 626 Refer to footnote 615 on page 144. 627 The increase still visible in Figure 52 from 1995 to 2015 is the sign that the inflation adjustment does not fully compensate the evol u- tion of the charges during this period. This indicates that that the consumer index does not reflect the progression of the s alaries occur- ring in this period as the other charges have not changed significantly during these years (see Table 18 ). 628 The value of 450 kCHF in 2015 constitutes a peak in the operational expenses of the LKO. With the reduction of the observatio ns since 2015 (meteorological and s now observations abandoned) the costs were already reduced. Substantial savings (all in all almost 1/3 of the costs) are particularly expected to be realized with the move to Davos taking into account the elimination of the renting costs, taking advantage of the automation of the spectrophotometers and benefiting from the synergy with the PMOD for the operational and technical aspects. It is to precise that the costs of the full automation of the Dobson spectrophotometers realized in 2010-2015 were not included here. 147 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO of the scientific attractiveness of the measurements in that the greater the investments for scientific activities the more valuable the data generally is for the scientific community 629. Only funding spent by Swiss institutions were considered in this overview, although very valuable studies using Swiss ozone data have been realized by scientists from other countries 630. Table 19 presents an estimate of the costs related to the scientific work based on approximate nom i- nal and real (inflation- adjusted) numbers; they demonstrate the constant efforts in manpower (PU) which have been made in the different specific periods to enhance the quality and exploit the added value of the data obtained at the LKO by treating the scientific aspects related to these measur e- ments. Numbers for the 1920s and 1930s are very difficult to determine and might be underestimated: wit h- out direct information available from the early periods of the LKO to precisely assess the time devo t- ed by G\u00f6tz to the analysis of the measurements and publication, this part is estimated to be in the order of 30% (see Table 19). G\u00f6tz started his extraordinary scientific production at the beginning of the 1920s ( Annex 2 ), but before the period 1944- 1953 the budget covered by the \"regular sponsors\" gave him the opportunity to engage assistants only occasionally (Sect. 9.2.1.a) .

However, when the number of publications is considered, one also should take into account that the topic of ozone research might lose its attractiveness when the political problem is considered solved by the MP. 630 One of the most significant contribution directly deduced from the Arosa total ozone series was the result of the PhD thesis of Harris dedicated to the issue of ozone depletion (Harris, 1989; Sect. 6.1). 148 Scientifi c Rep ort MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) G\u00f6tz had been looking for external support since the late 1920s. He financed his expedition to Sval- bard with a grant from the German Research Foundation 631 (Sect. 3.8) of 4,000 Reichsmark 632. Because of serious financial restrictions at the beginning of World War II, G\u00f6tz began applying inten- sively for grants in order to tackle new projects and to ensure an optimal scientific evaluation of the data. He prospected the private industry 633 and public institutio ns in Switzerland 634 as well as out- side of Switzerland 635. From 1944 onwards he had the opportunity to participate in a \"climatological action\" of the Swiss government (Sect. 3.6.4). From this action, he obtained 10,000 CHF/y for four years; on average the different grants represented 6,000 CHF/y in the years between 1944 and 1953. He therefore had the possibility of hiring 8 collaborators during this period, from some months to several years as summarized in Table 20 636. As the regular budget covered by the \"regular spon- sors\" (mainly dedicated to operational activities) amounted to about 15 kCHF/y, the external grants of 6 kCHF/y represented in the last period of G\u00f6tz's career practically 30% of the total budget of 21 kCHF/y. When adjusted for inflation, the mean annual resources devoted to scientific work in the period 1946- 1955 can be estimated at amounting to 45 kCHF; for the decade 1956- 1965 they were in the order of 50 kCHF (see Table 19).

Here the work load of the collaborators funded by external grants is exclus ively attributed to their scientific analysis (wich is probably not a completely realistic assumption). 149 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institut e of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 9 Overall development of the LKO During the period 1965- 1985, when D\u00fctsch was professor at ETH Z\u00fcrich, the LKO could benefit from the infrastructure and services of ETH not only to support the operation of the observations but also to promote scientific studies based on the data 637. With the contribution of D\u00fctsch himself to the pr o- cessing and interpretation of the LKO's measurements and the PhDs funded in this period, the real expenses dedicated to the scientific work were approximately 85 kCHF/y for the decade 1966- 1975 and 120 kCHF/y for the decade 1976- 1985, when adjusted for inflation (see Table 19) 638. Justified by the observed decline of the ozone layer and the MP (Sect. 7.1), with the start of the co l- laboration MeteoSwiss -ETH Z\u00fcrich in 1988, a great effort was devoted not only to the technical and operational aspects of the LKO but also to QA/QC and scientific studies. Staehelin on the ETH side as well as St\u00fcbi (since 1998) and Maillard (since 2001) at MeteoSwiss dedicated an important part of their time to scientific activities related to the LKO ozone measurements 639 (Sect. 9.2.3). The work devoted to SAG -Ozone (see details in Section 7.5) can also be viewed as a substantial contri bution of MeteoSwiss as well as ETH Z\u00fcrich to QA/QC matters. Furthermore, financial support for PhD theses was available in all the years from 1988 onwards 640. With these facts in mind, it can be as- sumed that the yearly contributions for scientific work during the period 1996 -2015 amounted on average to 225 kCHF/y when inflation is taken into account (see Table 19 and Figure 53). 0.0050.00100.00150.00200.00250.00300.00 1925 1935 1945 1955 1965 1975 1985 1995 2005 2015Mean annual nominal and real expenses averaged per decade kCHF/y Year center of decadeLKO Scientific Resources Inflation Nominal G\u00f6tz KVV ArosaD\u00fctsch ETHZaeteoSwiss / ETHZ Figure 53: Mean annual expense s (nominal and real (inflation -adjusted) ) averaged per decade in Swiss Francs (kCHF/y) concerning the scientif ic work ( covering QA/QC, analysis and research) related to the LKO measurements between 1925 to 2015 (\" real\" means taking into account inflation (2015=100%).

The means dedicated to research resp. scientific work (see Table 19 and Figure 53) represent the efforts invested to exploit the measurements added value. Figure 54 allows the comparison of the scientific resources with the operational costs. Since the 1940s 641, they are estimated to be most of the time 642 at a level corresponding to approximately half of the operational costs, independent of the organizational and financial regime at the LKO 643. The means, although substantial, may appear somehow moderate when trying to make full use of the potential of the LKO observations. But it should be made clear that we only included here Swiss research contributions, in the last decades mainly of MeteoSwiss and ETH Z\u00fcrich. In fact, as demonstrated by the preceding chapters, the measurement activities of the LKO have to be seen in a larger, internationally oriented context , which -500-400-300-200-1000100200300 1925 1935 1945 1955 1965 1975 1985 1995 2005 2015Mean annual real expenses averaged per decade kCHF/y Year center of decadeLKO Operation and Science Science Operation G\u00f6tz KVV ArosaD\u00fctsch ETHZaeteoSwiss / ETHZ Figure 54: Mean annual real (inflation adjusted) expenses averaged per decade in Swiss Francs (kCHF/y) concerning the operational and scientific work related to the LKO measurements (for definition see tex t) between 1925 and 2015.

In particular, the ozone measurements were (and still are) mainly aimed as a contribution to the world wide ozone monitoring in the framework of the GAW Programme of WMO. They are al so very useful for the calibration of the satellite measurements as the Arosa platform include both reliable Dobson as well as Brewer data. Most of the added value is therefore realized through the use in global trend reports, the satellite ground truthing as well as analyzes made by scientist s all over the world. But, nevertheless, the stud- ies resp. scientific activities financed at the national level are crucial to control and maintain the high quality of the data and to give a rapid feedback to the persons in charge of the performance of the observations. 9.3.3 Overall expenses From the real values presented above we can roughly estimate the total expenses of the LKO over the entire duration. In inflation- adjusted terms, the cumulated operational costs correspond approx i- mately to an amount of 18 million CHF and the amount spent by Swiss institutions for related scien- tific activities represent nearly 10 million CHF. The estimated total expenses related to the LKO for the period 1921- 2015 are therefore in the order of 28 million CHF. In 2017, the annual cost s dedicated to Data and Climate 644 in the budget of MeteoSwi ss amounted to 28.6 Million CHF 645; the expenses for the LKO during almost 100 years therefore correspond nearly to the annual expenses of MeteoSwiss for activities related to the measurements. The overall LKO expenses might not seem especially high compared to the costs of satellite mi s- sions 646 when consi dering the benefit these ground- based measurements, among others, bring to the satellite systems. 644 This corresponds to the Product G roup 1 (PG1) of MeteoSwiss In 2017, the Swiss contribution to EUMETSAT (from t he MeteoSwiss budget) was 18.8 Million CHF. 152 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) 153 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's long est atmospheric ozone measurements 10 Summary and outlook 10 Summary and outlook Here we summarize the key results of the historical Swiss long- term ozone study (see Sect. 1.1).

Overview of LKO history 10.1 The founding of the LKO in 1921 and the continued support for the first decades of measurements by the KVV Arosa and other institutions was initially justified by its medical application (i.e. therapy of lung TB). The relationship between G\u00f6tz in Arosa and Dorno in Davos, which was important in the starting phase of the LKO, was quite friendly and characterized by mutual respect but apparently became difficult in the period from 1924- 1926. It seems that Dorno, whose institute, created in 1907, provided the nucleus for the PMOD in Davos, developed a more and more difficult relationship with his former colleague G\u00f6tz. Available documents suggest that personal characters of both Dorno and 154 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) G\u00f6tz (Sect. 3.10) made mutually beneficial collaboration difficult for both partners. The search for a proper collaboration may have also been complicated by a possible competition between medical doctors in Arosa and Davos and/or by competition of the health resort authorities of Arosa and D a- vos. With the availability of modern antibiotics a few years after World War II, justifiying the measure- ments of the LKO with the therapy of lung TB became obsolete. Towards the end of World War II, G\u00f6tz started justifying the continuation of measurements at the LKO and further studies including surface ozone by means of more general arguments related to air quality and comparison of env i- ronmental factors among resort areas - arguments however not directly applicable to the continua- tion of total ozone measurements. At the same time, G\u00f6tz published annually in the peer -reviewed literature. He was a brilliant scientist who became a world- leading expert in atmospheric ozone r e- search. He obviously was also very careful in performing and overseeing the quality of the measur e- ments, so that we can still today make use of the measurements of this period, despite the fact that long- term trend analysis had not been a topic of concern prior to the 1970s. If G\u00f6tz had decided to leave Arosa in 1940 (Sect. 3.6.3) when funding was significantly reduced while he was in discussion for several offers of professorship positions, the total ozone series of Arosa most probably would have been terminated after having delivered reliable measurements of about a decade. After the early death of G\u00f6tz in 1954 at the age of 63, the continuation of the measurements of the LKO was highly uncertain. D\u00fctsch and Perl, among others, were strongly involved in securing the continuation of ozone measurements at the LKO (total ozone and Umkehr). When D\u00fctsch became professor at ETH Z\u00fcrich his interests were first in ozone climatology, circulation in the atmosphere and its consequences for weather forecasting. In the 1970s, D\u00fctsch was able to integrate the LKO into IACETH. Discussions about anthropogenic ozone depletion, which started in the first part of the 1970s, provided a new motivation to continue long- term ozone measurements at the LKO. Significant efforts were needed to reach the very high long- term calibration stability required for reliable long- term trend analysis. The decreasing total ozone trends documented by the end of the 1980s (see below) was probably important for the decision of the DuPont company - the market leader in production of chlorofluor o- carbons - to stop the production of these ozone depleting substances (Sect. 6.1). After the retirement of D\u00fctsch in 1985, it was again unclear whether the measurements at the LKO could be continued because ETH Z\u00fcrich argued that such long- term measurements should be con- tinued by other institutions more oriented to operational measurements. In 1988, MeteoSwiss took over the responsibility for performing the long- term measurements at the LKO. The study of the e f- fectiveness of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments was the basic motivation for society to continue supporting long- term ozone measurements at Arosa and Payerne at that time. In the period 1988- 2014, scientific research and QA/QC activities with these measurements were pursued at IA C- ETH, which can be viewed as continuation of the earlier scientific work of D\u00fctsch. This collaboration between IACETH and MeteoSwiss was successful in exploiting the measurements in the context of international research, e.g. by PhD theses funded through GAW -CH and other research agencies. 155 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Ob servatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 10 Summary and outlook The Montreal Protocol (1987) was very successful in limiting the emissions of manmade Ozone D e- pleting Substances (such as chlorine and bromine containing organic compounds). Chemical ozone depletion as determined by the time evolution of anthropogenic emissions of ODS was peaking around the second part of the 1990s at midlatitudes. Climate change caused by the increasing anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide 647) not only affects the tropospheric climate such as mean temperature, precipitation, rise of ocean level, melting of glaciers but also is expected to change the dynamics of the strat o- sphere. Numerical simulations based on state- of-the-art CCMs predict changes in the stratospheric dynamics, namely in the so -called Brewer -Dobson circulation that transports stratospheric ozone from the source region of the tropical stratosphere to midlatitudes. The enhancement of the Brewer - Dobson circulation is predicted to lead to larger total ozone amounts at midlatitudes as compared to the level before anthropogenic ozone depletion started (around the beginning of the 1970s) , which is also called \"super -recovery\". This process is expected to become dominant over the recovery from ODS in the second part of this century. These changes (particularly large at northern midlatitudes) should be viewed as part of Earth's system changes as caused by climate change. This implies that high- quality ozone measurements are needed to document these changes that are presently only predicted by numerical simulation. Since around the middle of the 1990s the scientific community tries to document the recovery of the ozone layer from the recovery of the ozone depleting substances, a discussion which is still ongoing. The costs of running the LKO strongly increased over time (Sect. 9.3). The costs were very low at the beginning because of G\u00f6tz's commitment. He not only worked very hard but also spent his family inheritance in constructing Villa Firnelicht, allowing him to run his own small research institute. We also have to point out that an important part of the large increase in costs, especially during the M e- teoSwiss -ETH period, resulted from the demand of reliable trend analysis, a challenge which led to quasi simultaneous total ozone measurements by two Dobson and three Brewer instruments. This led to additional investment costs for instruments and further expenses for automation. Funding of ground- based long-term monitoring 10.2 The reasons for continuing the Arosa measurements have changed many times over past decades and it was never imagined that such a long record could be established. The justifications for the LKO measurements for society can be summarized (see Figure 55) as 1. to study environmental factors potentially important for the medical recovery from pulmonary TB (relevant from the beginning until around World War II), 2. to investigate air quality as an important \"natural resource\" in resort areas (as discussed in the second half of World War II), 3. to improve our understanding of atmospheric physics for improved weather forecasts (im-portant in the 1960s and early 1970s), 4. to quantify anthropogenic ozone destruction by ODS (mid- 1970s to mid- 1990s), 5. to document the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol in saving ozone (since around the middle of the 1990s), 647 Note that ODS and its substitu tes are strong greenhouse gases. 156 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Inst itute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) 6. to understand the mutual relationship between climate change and global ozone depletion and the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol (this century). \"It is difficult to obtain funding for continuous observations through normal science funding agencies such as the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), since an additional few years of measur e- ments usually do not result in novel scientific conclusions. This is the experience within other net-works as well, for example NDACC. The success of the Montreal Protocol measures probably con-tributed to the decrease in the number of ozone measurements submitted to the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Center (WOUDC, presently operated by Environment and Climate Change Canada) over the past few years (Geir Braathen, personal communication). This might be exacerbated in the future as monitoring costs come under further pressure in many countries. However, we believe that such routine measurements making an important contribution to environmental monitoring are the responsibility of developed countries. Institutions like national meteorological services, although they also may experience financial shortfalls, are ideally suited to carry out these types of measurements since they are (in contrast to universities) capable of making long- term commitments and have the possibility to hire permanent staff. On the other hand, universities have the advantage of being able to focus on particular issues (e.g. through PhD theses) for a limited time, resulting in articles in peer - reviewed journals. It is important to stress the relevance of scientific activities using long- term obser- vations. Excellent collaboration has existed between MeteoSwiss and ETH Z\u00fcrich for the past three decades. However, this particular type of cooperation will be less feasible in future, as the required permanent scientific positions will typically no longer be available at universities. In other countries the research aspects are often integrated in the same institution (e.g. the German Weather Service (DWD) in Germany or the \"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)\" in France).\" 648 Intercomparison with standard instruments 10.3 The Dobson series of Arosa needed homogenization, but the long- term stability of the record was hardly affected because of the careful application of the statistical Langley plot calibration by D\u00fctsch (Staehelin et al., 1998a). Over the last decades the calibration of the network for ground- based monitoring of the ozone layer was gradually improved. The success of the regular intercomparisons for increasing the reliability of the Dobson network is shown in Fi gure 56. The experience of the Arosa series suggests that the application of such intercomparisons should be assessed critically for special instruments/stations such as Arosa. Particularly since the transfer of the calibration of one to another Dobson instrument by side by side calibration is within \u00b11 % uncer- tainty and in the regular Dobson intercomparison the World Dobson scale (D83) needs to be trans-ferred to the regional standard instrument before calibrating the station instruments. In the 1995 Dobson intercomparison at Arosa, a correction of the Arosa Dobson instrument (D101, for AD - wavelength and operational \u00b5 -range (1 -2.5)) and the regional standard instrument of 2.1% was sug- gested, which was believed to be inconsistent with other total ozone measurements of the station (for more detail see Staehelin et al., 1998a). The deviation of the Arosa instruments from the standard instrument were much smaller in the subsequent intercomparisons suggesting that the 1995 inter- 648 Note that this passage and the following texts in quotes originate from Staehelin et al.

Therefore, the information of the redundant measurements of two Dobson and three Brewer instruments should be considered in the Swiss total ozone series.

Scientific value of the LKO ozone measurements 10.4 \"Homogenous long- term records such as the world's total ozone series from Arosa are very valuable for trend analyses in climate science. Reliable long- term, ground- based total ozone measurements are crucial for validation of ozone observations from space, particularly in terms of validating the long- term stability of merged satellite datasets (e.g. Labow et al., 2013) 649. Furthermore, they serve as a baseline for evaluating numerical simulations such as Chemistry Climate models (CCMs), which are used to make projections of future ozone evolution (see e.g. Eyring et al., 2013; Dhomse et al., 2018; see Section 8.1). The extraordinary length of the Arosa record was important for a wide r ange of studies, including the analysis of stratospheric ozone related to long- term climate variability such as the NAO/AO (Appenzeller et al., 2000) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (Br\u00f6nnimann et al., 2004a and b). Furthermore, the measurements have been very valuable for the evaluation of the (early part of the) Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project (Compo et al., 2011; Br\u00f6nnimann and Com- 649 Satellite instruments measure ozone from space allowing for quasi- global ozone monitoring (continuous ozone monitoring from space started in 1978). 158 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) po, 2012)\" 650. The possibility of such studies might be viewed as a \"secondary scientific benefit\" of the measurements as they were not anticipated when the measurements started in Arosa in 1926. Because of its high data quality , the Arosa ozone data series played a key role in the 1988 Interna- tional Ozone Trends Panel report (IOTP, 1988, see Sect. 7.1). At that time significant downward ozone trends were viewed as key evidence for effectiveness of the causal relationship between ozone depletion and the emissions of chlorofluorocarbons as first suggested by the theory of Molina and Rowland (1973) but questioned particularly by chemical industry for many years. However, sub-sequent analysis indicated that part of the decreasing downward trend as measured by Arosa was attributable to changes in meteorological transport as described by NAO/AO condition. In the early 1990s, changes of the order of \u00b1 1 % (3 D.U.) per decade were believed to be required (rule of thumb) for long- term ozone trend detection 651 both for ground- based as well as satellite measur e- ments, compare Dobson and TOMS total ozone series (Labow et al., 2013). \"From our experience the following issues were most relevant for the successful operation of LKO over the last decades: Redundancy allows for increased credibility of measurements, which is particularly important for reliable long- term trend analysis. At Arosa, three Dobson and three Brewer spectropho- tometers were simultaneously operated since 1998, which helps to obtain important scien-tific results regarding Dobson and Brewer spectrophotometers relevant within the broader context of atmospheric ozone measurements. Regular comparison of station instruments with standard spectrophotometers operated un-der the WMO umbrella is important for high- quality measurements and consistency of ozone measurements within a particular network. Scientific analysis and use of stratospheric ozone measurements in scientific publications and model intercomparisons not only enhances visibility of the measurements within the community but is also a quality assessment, which might motivate scientists and technicians operating the measurements. Reliable techniques are important for high quality stratospheric ozone measurements includ-ing automation to reduce manpower costs and to make measurements less dependent on the skills of an individual operator.\" It is also remarkable that several times in the history of the LKO (especially when continuation of measurements was highly uncertain, namely in the period 1954- 1965 after the death of G\u00f6tz and during 1985- 1988 when D\u00fctsch retired) the move of the measurements of the LKO (total ozone as well as Umkehr) from Arosa to Davos was considered. Now the transfer of the measurements from Arosa to Davos (Sect. 8.2) was decided after automation of the Dobson spectrophotometers and several years of parallel measurements, thus improving the synergies between MeteoSwiss and the PMOD. \"From the very beginning, the ozone measurements from Arosa (initiated by the fruitful collaboration between G\u00f6tz and Dobson) have been an important contribution both to the global network of ozone measurements and to ozone research. During the early part of the record, the International Ozone 650 Note that this passage and the following texts in quotes originate from Staehelin et al. (2018a). 651 R emember , that the precision of individual total ozone measurements of Dobson instruments are around \u00b1 0.5% and the day to day meteorological variability \u00b1 20%. 159 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmosp heric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements 10 Summary and outlook Commission ( IO3C) of IAMAS coordinated the ozone measurements. Since the 1970s, WMO has taken the lead, first in the framework of the Global Ozone Observing System (G O3OS), later the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme (SAG -Ozone) became responsible for overseeing and coordinating stratospheric ozone measurements to obtain and maintain high quality data suitable for long- term trend analysis. GAW might continue these activities in collaboration with other networks, such as NDACC, the present Brewer COST network, and the IO 3C in order to (i) maintain and extend high quality records of ground- based ozone stations and (ii) to continue comparisons of Dobson and Brewer measurements with other/new instruments such as SAOZ and PANDORA.\" 652 Scientific challenges 10.5 As pointed out above, high reliability of measurements in the future needs to continue as the rates in stratospheric ozone increase attributable to the recovery of the ozone layer from ozone depleting substances is considerably smaller than the decrease in the 1980s. Additionally the effect of climate change on ozone is still uncertain and the projections based on complex climate chemistry models need very careful evaluati on with long- term measurements. Beyond any doubt the Montreal Protocol (including its strengthenings) has been very successful for the protection of the ozone layer over densely populated areas, avoiding large damage by manmade chemicals as shown by extended numerical simulations (Newmann et al., 2009). Montzka et al. (2018) found for the first time clear deviation between monitoring measurements of CFC -11 and emissions as expected by the Montreal Protocol , which needs further study 653. The recent study of Ball et al. ( 2018) failed to confirm an upward trend in total ozone as expected from numerical simul a- tions for northern mid- latitudes despite increases in upper stratospheric ozone indicat ing that the Montreal Protocol is indeed \"working\" as expected. In order to compare merged satellite series i n the future, when the stratosphere is expected to gradually recover from the decreasing burden of ODS, continued observations will not only be required to document the expected increase in stratospheric ozone; they will also be necessary for documenting the effects of climate change on stratospheric ozone, as predicted to happen by CCMs, i.e. through enhancement of the Brewer Dobson Circulation and possible other effects connected with climate change, which need furt her study. For reliable documentation of such trends long- term measurement stability of 1 D.U. per decade should be en- visaged (Ball et al., 2018, 2019). Move of instruments from Arosa to Davos and homogenization of 10.6 the series The following information was presented at a meeting at Davos in February 2019 attended by per-sons of PMOD, IACETH and MeteoSwiss. The automation of the Dobson spectrophotometer was successfully completed 654. The complete automation of Dobson instruments allow s dissociating the measurement quality from the skills of the operators and significantly increasing the number of measurements. In order to filter the measurements with low data quality (as caused by cloudy condi- tion) new procedures for data quality assessments needed to be introduced and tested. 652 Note that this passage and the following texts in quotes originate from Staehelin et al. (2018a). 653 Hegglin (2018) showed that the unaccunted amount of CFC -11 is small. 654 Paper in preparation. 160 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) All instruments (three Brewer and three Dobson) are now running in automated mode. For both types of instrument, the total ozone column is monitored by the direct sun method and the ozone profile by the Umkehr method. Until recently two Dobson and two Brewer instruments were operated at Arosa and one Dobson and one Brewer at Davos for parallel measurements. Since autumn 2018 the opposite configuration has been implemented with two Brewer instruments (B072, B156) and two Dobson instruments (D 101, D051) operational at Davos, while one Brewer (B040) and one Dobson (D062) are continuing oper a- tional measurements at Arosa. This Davos - Arosa parallel measurement period will be extended until 2021. The difference between Davos and Arosa measurements is maxim al during the summer (~0.5% higher in Davos than Arosa) based on almost six years of parallel Brewer measurements in the period 2010- 2016 (St\u00fcbi et al., 2017a). New results from the project ATMOZ 655 are now available and can be used to better under stand existing differences between measurements performed with Brewer and Dobson instruments . The goal of this project was the improved characterization and calibration of the Brewer - and Dobson- spectroradiometers to gain a deeper knowledge of the measurem ent uncertainties of these instr u- ments (e.g. , slit functions of individual Dobson measurements were measured) . All Brewer and Dobson instruments were successfully calibrated in 2018 in intercomparisons per- formed at Arosa, including the official Dobson and Brewer traveling references. Before interpreting the parallel measurements, these calibration results will have to be analyzed carefully in order to determine to what extent the station instruments should be adjusted. As the world longest total ozone series is based on Dobson instruments, it will be important as a next step to carefully study the comparison of the Dobson measurements at Arosa and Davos. The ho- mogenization of the Dobson series will be important since detecting changes in the order of 1.5 D.U. will be required in t he present recovery phase ( Ball et al., 2019, submitted). Differences and changes in the measurements at the two sites, possibly considering tropospheric flows at the two sites have to be further investigated. Finally, the us e of independent data from total satellite overpass data and from the measurements of Hohenpeissenberg will allow testing the ho-mogenized Swiss alpine total ozone series for homogeneity. Statistical methods as used by Ball et al. might be applied in this c ontext. Obviously, the skills and resources are available to make the best effort to homogenize the Dobson series. 655 ATMOZ: Joint Research Project \"Traceability for atmospheric total column ozone\" (with PMOD/WRC as JRP coordinator) within the European Metrology Research Progamme (EMRP) of the European Association of National Metrology Institutes (EURAMET) . 161 Scientific Report MeteoSwis s No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements Acknowledgments Acknowledgment s We would first like to thank Stefan Br\u00f6nnimann (University of Bern) for his competent and valuable review , which was very helpful to us.

W. P. G\u00f6tz and M. G\u00f6tz Appendix 2 Natu ralization of F. W. P. G\u00f6tz and M. G\u00f6tz For naturalization in Switzerland, support from the local, the cantonal (small council of the Canton of Grisons in case of naturalization of the couple G\u00f6tz) as well as the federal authorities (Police Office of the Federal Justice and Police Department in Bern) is required (the information below originates from documents available at the Swiss Archives (Bundesarchiv) in Bern. The first attempt of naturalization of G\u00f6tz and his wife failed because the cantonal authority rejected the application. G\u00f6tz and his wife travelled several times to Germany and Austria during the World War II , and this made the cantonal authority suspicious (document of 8/17 October 1945 of small council of the Canton of Grisons) (\" Obwohl dorthin unternahm \"). This implies between the lines the accusation that the applicants might have collaborated with the Nazi regime. The second trial for naturalization was sent to the police department of the federal government in Bern by Dr. Hans Schmid, lawyer in Arosa and president of the political community of Arosa, on 5 March 1946 which included forms filled out by G\u00f6tz and the following documents : (a) The reply of G\u00f6tz regarding travelling (report of our travelling to Germany, 26 February 1946) starts by explaining that international travelling is very important for scientific communication (con-gresses, meetings illustrated by many examples) for his professional activities working in an isolated institute in Arosa. He also points out that he offered the opportunity to Hedwig Kohn ( Sect. 3.6.2) to work at LKO when she was fleeing from the Nazi regime because of her Jewish family background, illustrating that he did not care about politics. During World War II he needed to travel to Austria in 1938 to support his colleague Prof. Conrad who needed to emigrate to USA, a further trip to Austria was required to explain to Prof. von Ficker in a personal meeting why he did not follow the call to become professor in Vienna (which was not feasible by written communication). In 1943, he ac cept- ed the invitation to a seminar in Frankfurt which was difficult for him to refuse as Prof Linke had twice offered him a job in Frankfurt. He visited Germany in spring 1943 and he travelled in spring 1944 to a conference near Dresden (obviously the ozone conference in Tharant, see Table 5) offering him the possibility to promote the new results of his PhD student D\u00fctsch ( Sect. 3.4, see Table 6), who gradu- ated in February 1946 at the University of Z\u00fcrich ( Sect. 5.1). In addition to these scientific justific a- tions to travel to Germany, he took the opportunity to visit (f or only one to two days ) his 80- years -old mother who had visited Arosa annually before World War II (later she was not able to obtain a permit to visit Switzerland). Private motivations were the reasons for his wife Margarete G\u00f6tz to travel to Frankfurt: her sister living in Frankfurt was married to a Jewish husband (family name Gr\u00fcnewald) who needed help emigrating to Uruguay. The situation was particularly dramatic when she was i n- formed in spring 1944 that her relatives in Frankfurt suffered from bomb attacks, her sister was si ck and her niece was under direct threat because she was half Jewish. In this difficult time in the final phase of World War II (which finally ended in 2 September 1945) she traveled to Germany without a 194 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) valid return visa which was impossible to obtain fr om the Swiss government. However, by electing to travel to Germany at her own risk (as suggested from some \"persons in Bern\") the stay in Germany needed to be extended, against her will, to a longer duration. (b) The declaration written and signed by Maron, president of the KVV Arosa, of 14 February 1946 starts by describing the scientific merits of G\u00f6tz as a world renown leading scientist in ozone r e- search, pointing out G\u00f6tz's outstanding role and his invitations to scientific meetings, even during World W ar II, and stating that these invitations should be viewed as important for tourism in Arosa as the research of G\u00f6tz is important for promoting Arosa and the Swiss Alps as a resort area (particular-ly mentioning the research of LKO in t he \"climatological ac tion\" see Sect. 3.6.4). The letter continues that through knowing G\u00f6tz since 1921 he (Maron) is aware that G\u00f6tz is a scientist exclusively inter-ested in his science but who never had any sympathy with the Hitler regime as his political attitude is very democratic. A remark emphasises that because of G\u00f6tz's concentration on science, he might not be perfectly integrated in the community in Arosa. The l etter ends pointing out that the naturaliz a- tion is important for the continuation of the scientific research of G\u00f6tz and therefore he strongly rec- ommends naturalization for Mr and Mrs G\u00f6tz which should be viewed as an honor for Switzerland. (c) A declarati on from Schmid on 2 March 1946 states that G\u00f6tz was never active in politics, de- scribes the scientific merits of G\u00f6tz and mentions that G\u00f6tz rejected several job offers from German and Austrian universities, standing by his decision to stay in Arosa. He declares that G\u00f6tz has an excellent reputation among the population of Arosa, this being the reason that the citizens' communi- ty of Arosa is keen to accommodate G\u00f6tz as a new member. (d) The list of references for the application of Prof. G\u00f6tz contains 21 names, including three medical doctors of Arosa, other names from the Canton of Grisons (including (among others) Erhard Branger, Director of the Rhaetian Railway company, Adolf Nadig, member of the Swiss parliament and Alfred Kreis, teacher at the Academic High School Chur), several persons from the Canton of Z\u00fcrich (among others) Prof. Edgar Meyer, Director of the Physics Institute of the University of Z\u00fcrich, Prof. Dr med. Kurt von Neergard, Robert Billwiler, Director (1941- 1943) of MeteoSwiss (at that ti me Ei d- gen\u00f6ssische Meteorologische Zentralanstalt), from Bern (among others) Prof. Dr med. Alexander von Muralt from the University of Bern, Rapha\u00ebl Cottier, Director of the Federal Office for Transport and from Basel (Prof. Paul Huber, Director of the Phys ical Institute of the University of Basel). (No name of PMOD is included in the reference list, for Davos only Dr med. Rudolf Wolfer is listed who was living in the Canton of Z\u00fcrich at that time but who had previously lived in Davos). The reconsideration request was sent to Bern and checks were made as to whether G\u00f6tz and his wife were registered in any criminal records. No such entries were found (11 March 1946). On 23 March 1946 a letter from the naturalization office in Bern was sent to the member of the gov- erning council of the police department of the Canton of Grisons writing that Schmid was asking for reconsideration of its negative decision. In the same letter it also states that the responsible offices in Bern support the naturalization of the coupl e G\u00f6tz. The additional information convinced the small council of the Canton of Grisons to reverse its decision and to support the naturalization of G\u00f6tz and his wife. In its letter dated 4 April 1946 we read that the small council were convinced that the many travels to Germany during World War II only served scientific purposes and therefore gave its sup-port for the naturalization. This finally led to the approval of the naturalization of Mr and Mrs G\u00f6tz sent from the Justice and Police Department of the Federal Government in Bern dated 18 April 1946. 195 Scientific Report MeteoSwiss No. 104 and Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science (ETH Z\u00fcrich) The Light Climatic Observatory Arosa The story of the world's longest atmospheric ozone measurements Annex 1 Expedition Spitzbergen vom 1 2.
