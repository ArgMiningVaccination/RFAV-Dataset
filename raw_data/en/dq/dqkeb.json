Although meth isn't known for causing severe, physical withdrawal symptoms, it is still understood as being incredibly addictive. Its addictive properties can be attributed to the effects that it has on the central nervous system's reward pathway. Without meth and similar substances, dopamine releases are typically used to reward beneficial or positive behaviors. For instance, a person might receive a dopamine rush after working out, helping others, or engaging in mutually rewarding social behaviors. However, when methamphetamine is regularly used, the brain comes to recognize meth use itself as a beneficial behavior. As a result, crystal meth users become programmed to reach for the substance whenever they want to feel better. A typical methamphetamine high lasts just several hours. When users come down from crystal meth, they often experience what is known as a \"meth crash\". Crashing or coming down from meth may cause excessive fatigue, feelings of intense hunger, and overwhelming depression. People who use meth may continue to do so even when they no longer want to. This is due to the fear of experiencing the uncomfortable \"meth crash.\" At Agape Detox Center, we acknowledge that behavioral therapy is the most effective treatment for meth addiction.
