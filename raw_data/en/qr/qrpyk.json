We pic the ingredients with great care to make sure that we can provide vegan, cruelty-free and environmentally friendly products for eco-conscious customers, their friends and family members. All of our vegan reed diffusers are alcohol-free and made with the highest quality essential oils, ensuring quality and freshness, unlike other air fresheners. We don't use alcohol, mineral oils, petroleum-based fragrance oils, dyes or glitters when creating our diffusers because we want to keep them as pure as possible. How to use our Reed Diffusers? Before using these non-toxic reed diffusers, shake the bottle to mix the contents. Then, fill the diffuser bottle with the required amount of reeds and let them soak. How many reeds should I put into the reed diffuser? Always start with a smaller amount of reeds - for smaller rooms or a more subtle scent start with 3-4 reeds. For bigger rooms or more pungent scent, use 5-6 reeds. Once a week, flip the reeds to refresh the scent and to prevent them from becoming overfilled with essential oils and dust. Flip them once a day if you want a stronger aroma throughout the day. When flipping them, be careful not to spill the oil. Unfortunately, reeds don't last forever... Dust and other contaminants in the air can partially or fully block the rattan reeds. Therefore you might feel that scent is not as strong as it was. If you think that rattan reeds have become clogged, simply replace them with new ones and keep enjoying the scent.

Natural nature Because we use pure essential oils when making our vegan-friendly reed diffusers, you may notice tiny particles of plants in the diffuser oil. These do not affect the quality and merely demonstrate that natural oils were used when making reed diffuser oil. Scent throw time and strength Depending on the size and number of reeds and the room's climate (temperature, humidity) - 100ml can last up to 4 months. All of us have different sensitivity to scents. As a result, we formulated our vegan friendly reed diffusers with a combination of oils that would not irritate an average sensitivity. If the scent isn't potent enough, you may add more reeds. Our senses adjust to the scents very fast, so it might seem that the reed diffuser has lost its aroma. Try leaving the room for some time and then get back in it. If you can smell the aroma again - continue using the same amount of reeds.
