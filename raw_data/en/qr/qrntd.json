Vandell, Biotage, LLC A new, efcient, effective, and sensitive sample prep- aration application for the extraction of the catechol-amines epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine from human plasma at levels using EVOLUTE WCX, a resin-based mixed-mode sorbent an optimized nonpolar (hydro-phobic) and weak cation exchange interactions. Catecholamines are standard biomarkers for the detection of diseases such as hypertention, pheochromocytoma, and neuroblastoma. Detection of these analytes in biological matrices (serum, plasma, and urine) at sub-nanogram per milliliter levels is critical in the clinical diagnosis of these and other diseases. Extraction Conditions Tis application note outlines the procedure using the EVOLUTE WCX 50 mg 3 mL column (part #612-0005-B) optimized for a 500 L plasma sample volume, but other formats are available. Method parameters and dilution factors have been optimized to maximize recoveries and minimize ion suppression.Sample pretreatment: Dilute 500 L of plasma 1:1 (v/v) with 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7. Spike sample with internal standard.Column conditioning: Condition column with methanol (1 mL)Column equilibration: Rinse column with 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7 (1 mL).Sample loading: Load pretreated plasma sample (1mL) at a flow rate of 1-2 mL/min.Interference elution 1: Remove polar and ionic (2 mL).Interference elution mL).Post extraction: Evaporate to dryness and reconstitute sample in mobile phase (200 uL). Te extracted samples were run on an Agilent 1200 Liquid Handling System with a Restek Ultra PFP Propyl 3-m analytical column (50 \u00d7 2.1 mm id) at ambient temperature. Te mobile phase was isocratic, 0.1% formic acid aq/methanol (98/2, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.200 mL/min for 5 min. Te detector was an Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex 4000 Q-T rap triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a T urbo Ionspray\u00ae interface for mass analysis. Negative ions were acquired in the multiple reac-tion monitoring mode (MRM); norepinephrine 170.2>152.2, epinephrine 184.1>166.1, and of over 85% with RSDs below 10% were achieved at pg/mL levels for epinephrine and dopamine and 1 ng/mL for nor-epinephrine. Figure 1 shows the extracted ion chromatogram. Conclusions Tis method demonstrates a robust and eective extraction of a range of catecholamines at signicantly low levels from the challenging biological matrix of human plasma. Some artifact peaks from the plasma were ob-served in the extracted ion chromatogram but these had no eect on the ions of interest, resulting in a clean and interference free chromatogram References (1) Victor E.

Progress in this eld depends upon technological ad-vancement in the elds of LC-MS and separation technology. In untargeted metabolomics, simultaneous detection of the largest number of metabolites is desired. Reversed phase C18 columns are generally used for this type to study, however they provide limited retention of polar compounds. In this paper, we compare the retention of 31 model compounds characterized by diflerent polarities using a Cogent e Imtakt Scherzo col-umn showed the best retention of polar compounds, with only 10% of the polar compounds eluting within the rst 2 min as compared to 22% by the Cogent column and 45% by the Waters column. Experimental All data were collected on an HPLC system coupled to mass spec de-tection. e mobile phase used for the column comparison of the 31 model compounds was A = water, 0.1% formic acid, B = acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. e linear gradient used started at 100%A (0-5 min) and nished at 100%B (35-40 min) (see Figure 1). Discussion and Results e study shows that Imtakt's Scherzo column, consisting of a combi-nation cation ligands, outperforms other C18 col-umns in the retention of polar metabolites. is result is important in the advancement of untargeted metabolomics, as traditional C18 columns struggle to retain polar compounds and can limit the detection of a wide polarity range of metabolites.

ESI-MS in positive and negative ionization modeTHE APPLICATION NOTEBOOK - JUNE 2011 12 Biological BioPharma Compass: A Fully Automated Solution for Characterization and QC of Intact and Digested Proteins Christian Albers, Laura B\u00e4\u00dfmann, and Wolfgang Jabs,/uni00A0 Bruker Daltonik GmbH BioPharma Compass is a fully automated solution for the rapid characterization of biopharmaceutical products such as proteins, peptides, RNA, and DNA. This push button solution assists nonspecialist op-erators to generate high quality, accurate data for automatic comparison with laboratory reference standards. Automated, visual reports are then gen-erated for each sample and important information regarding a products purity and identity can be ob-served at a glance. In this application note, we will apply the BioPharma Compass work/f_low to the QC characterization of two proteins including intact IgG1 and digested transferrin. Characterization of protein therapeutics and comparison with reference standards for the analysis of biotherapeutics usu- ally includes accurate analysis of the intact protein mass followed by complete amino acid sequence coverage, usually obtained by digestion of the protein by an enzyme and analysis by mass spec-trometry. These two complementary workflows ensure that the correct product has been produced with the correct modica-tions and detects any unexpected impurities that may affect the efcacy or safety of the protein drug. In this application note, we will demonstrate the BioPharma Compass QC workflow (as shown in Figure 1) in combination with two industry leading plat-forms, the Dionex UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system and the maXis UHR-TOF as samples of intact IgG1 and digested transferring are analyzed. Experimental For protein proflling experiments, human IgG1 from Sigma-Al-drich was used without further puriflcation. A batch of 20 sam-ples were prepared; 18 vials contained IgG1 with a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/\u00b5L, 1 vial contained a mixture of IgG1 and IgG4 and 1 vial only IgG4. 4 \u00b5L were injected from each vial. UHPLC 0.1% FA in ACNRun time: 15 min applying a gradient from 5 to 90% B followed by 3 min equilibration with 2% B spectrometer: Bruker transferrin was reduced, alkylated, and digested using trypsin according to the standard protocols. 48 vials per protein digest were prepared; the peptide concentration was 1 pmol/\u00b5L. 5 \u00b5L were injected from each vial. IgG1 and digested transferrin were per-formed in a fully automated fashion with BioPharma Compass. As soon as the IgG1 batch acquisition is started, a QC result table Figure 1: Overview of BioPharma Compass, describing the steps involved in a typical protein QC characterization work/f_low. These steps are completely automated. After comparison with reference standards and the setting of individual QC criteria, reports are automatically generated. The reports shown here display the deconvoluted intact protein mass, protein sequence coverage, BPC annotated with peptide sequences and a rapid QC screening report.THE APPLICATION NOTEBOOK - JUNE 2011 Biological 13 is generated as shown in Figure 2. Each row in the QC table in Figure 2 represents one IgG sample analysis. In this example the pass/fail criteria was based simply on mass accuracy. However, QC criteria may be adjusted to suit individual analysis require-ments. Figure 3 represents an example of the automated report output available with BioPharma Compass. For rapid throughput, samples can also be viewed in a 96 well format (Figure 4). Again, samples that have failed QC criteria are highlighted in red, those requiring further investigation are shown as amber, and samples that successfully meet QC criteria are shown in green. In this instance, the rst 48 wells correspond to the analysis of digested transferrin. Conclusion Biopharma Compass provides a fully automated workTow for the characterization of biopharmaceutical products such as pro-teins, peptides, RNA, and DNA. Sample acquisition, processing, comparison with reference standards, and report generation are achieved in parallel thus dramatically increasing productivity and sample throughput. In combination with the outstanding sensitivity, mass accuracy, and resolution of the maXis UHR-TOF , BioPharma Compass as-sists nonspecialist operators to rapidly generate high quality data to conrm the identity and purity of biopharmaceutical compounds to ensure drug safety and eflcacy. Bruker Daltonics Website: bruker.com/biopharma Figure 2: Table view summarizing the QC result of 20 IgG1 in- tact protein samples. Each row contains the result of one LC-MS experiment; in the columns are values of different quality con-trol criteria. Two samples are highlighted due to the presence of an unexpected impurity, another sample highlighted in red has failed to meet the QC criteria based on mass accuracy. This table also provides access to more-detailed pdf reports. Figure 3: Part of the automatically generated pdf QC report from an intact IgG1 protein sample. The identity of the sample is displayed in the header. In the second section the total ion chromatogram (TIC) and the chromatographic peaks (Com-pound List) are reported. The spectrum, deconvoluted with the Maximum Entropy algorithm, indicates the different glycosyl-ated isoforms of the antibody. The deconvoluted mass peaks are compared with a reference standard and the result of this comparison is reported in the Result List. Figure 4: Rapid view, QC result of digested Transferrin protein samples. In this example the mass deviation was chosen as qual-ity criterion. The sample is represented in green if the deviation is smaller than 3 ppm, yellow when the deviation is in the range between 3 and 5 ppm and red when it is above 5 ppm. Genera-tion of the QC table begins as soon as the rst sample has been acquired. THE APPLICATION NOTEBOOK - JUNE 2011 14 Biological Testosterone was extracted from human serum by strong anion exchange polymeric SPE and analyzed using a Kinetex C18, 30 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 \u00b5m ESI traditional sub-2 \u00b5m columns, producing greater chromatographic resolution, sensitivity, and higher peak capacities. Testosterone is an androgenic steroid responsible for the de-velopment of male reproductive organs, maintaining (or increasing) muscle mass and bone density. As anabolic steroids, testosterone has been used (or abused) to increase muscle mass and enhance the athletic performance. Te concentration of tes-tosterone is lower in the female population than the male and in general diminishes with advancing age. Monitoring body concen-tration of testosterone is an aid in diagnosing and treating disease state related to the hormonal imbalance. Te analysis is based on a simple extraction method using strong anion exchange SPE (Strata-X-A) to produce a clean ex-tract from human serum. Following the extraction, testosterone is derivatized to form an oxime which is then analyzed in posi-tive mode ESI LC-MS-MS under multiple-reactions-monitoring function (1). Kinetex col-umn eflciently separates testosterone from its isomeric form epit-estosterone (Figure 1). Experimental Conditions Te mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid with 1 mM am-monium formate with no pH adjustment, in water (MP A) and acetonitrile (MP B). A typical LC gradient is used (Table I) for the separation. An AB Sciex API 5000 triple-quadrupole tandem mass spec- trometer is used for analysis equipped with an ESI probe operating in positive polarity mode. Under an MRM mode, two channels were monitored for testosterone and testosterone-D3 (Table II). Results and Discussions As is demonstrated from the chromatogram, the Kinetex column provides a high degree of selectivity even in small dimensions to provide superior chromatographic separation.

Its special properties are a sharp sol-gel transition, low sol viscosity, and high eectiveness as a protective colloid. For properties of aqueous mixtures of gelatin with other biopoly- mers, the character of aggregates of -chains is important: Te en- tropy of mixing is reduced when gelatin chains are limited in their mobility by aggregation. SEC-MALS was used to study the aggregation behavior of gel- atin solutions as a function temperature without using denaturing agents, such as urea or SDS. In addition to the usual concen-tration detection by refractive index, optical rotation detection was applied to detect any changes in the degree of helicity of the gelatin chains. After soaking overnight at 4 \u00b0C, gelatin was heated for 30 min at 80 \u00b0C and subsequently kept for 60 min at the temperature of the measurement (50-80 \u00b0C). Te eluent was a 0.01-M potas-sium phosphate buer pH 6.7 with 0.125 M LiNO 3. Te col- umn set consisted of a precolumn PWH, 6000 PW, and 3000PW (all of TSK). Figures 1 and 2 show a reversible change of the bimodal molar mass distribution of two dierent porcine gelatins at tempera-tures between 50 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C (number in legend corresponds to temperature), well above the gelatin temperature of about 30 \u00b0C. Te eect of temperature on the molar mass distribution sug- gests the existence of a monomer-dimer equilibrium between gelatin chains (the shoulder corresponding to the monomer was 90-100 kDa, and the one corresponding to the dimer was ap-proximately 200 kDa). Te results explain the dierent behavior of these gelatins in mixtures with other biopolymers. Te ratio of the refractive index and the optical rotation was constant for MM <~400 kDa and is independent of temperature. No involvement of helix formation could be detected.

Chambers1, Mary E. Lame2, and Diane M. Diehl1, 1Waters Corporation and 2Pzer, Neuroscience Research Unit Fast, flexible platforms for peptide quantification are need- ed, particularly for a discovery setting. This type of meth- odology would be especially advantageous in the case of amy-loid beta (a ) peptides. The deposition/formation of insoluble aggregates, or plaques, of a peptides in the brain is consid- ered to be a critical event in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and thus has the attention of many researchers. A previous Waters application note (720003682en) described in detail the development of a fast, flexible SPE-LC-MS-MS platform for the quantification of multiple a peptides from human or monkey CSF for use in a biomarker or preclinical discovery setting. In this work, the mass spectrometry plat-form has been updated from the Xevo TQ MS to the Xevo TQ-S mass spectrometry system. This change facilitated both a 4\u00d7 reduction in required sample size and a 4-5\u00d7 increase in assay sensitivity.

MS was performed in positive ion mode since CID of the 4+ precursor ion yielded several distinct product ions corre-sponding to inherently specific b sequence ions (representa-tive spectrum shown in Figure 1). UPLC separation of the three amyloid peptides is shown in Figure 2. The increased sensitivity of the Xevo TQ-S triple quadru - pole mass spectrometer facilitated the use of 4 \u00d7 less sample and a 4-5 \u00d7 improvement in quantification limits (Table II). Average basal levels and RSD values for all 3 a peptides in two sources of human CSF are shown in Table III and are lower or equal to 5%. Overspiked QC samples were prepared in triplicate in two sources of pooled human CSF at 0.04, 0.075, 0.15, 0.2, 0.8, 2, and 6 ng/mL. Accuracy and precision values met the reg-ulatory criteria for LC-MS-MS assays. Results from QC sample analysis are shown in Table IV. Average deviation from expected is 2.3%. The method described herein eliminates time-consuming immunoassays or immunoprecipitation steps for preclinical work. The use of a single UPLC-MS-MS assay represents a significant advantage over an ELISA assay, which would require multiple assays with multiple antibodies to quantify each of the relevant peptides.

Historically, polysaccharide characterization by gel perme-ation chromatography (GPC) has been problematic, especially if high molar mass components are present. Because of its superior separation capability, especially on molecules exceeding 50 kDa, Tow fleld-Tow fractionation (Flow-FFF) is an excellent separation alternative. By coupling this technology to a multi angle light scattering (MALS) detector, such as a DAWN or miniDAWN, absolute values can be determined without making any assump-tions. We characterized 0.2% (w/v) HES solutions in doubly-dis- tilled water. e were 200/0.5, 130/0.42, and 70/0.5 from Serumwerk (Bernburg, Germany). e FFF system was an Eclipse connected to a DAWN EOS and an RI detector (Shodex 101). Volumes of 100 L were injected into the 350-m spacer channel containing a 10 kDa regenerated cellulose membrane. A channel Tow of 1 mL/min was kept constant while the cross Tow decreased linearly from 2 mL/min to 0 mL/min within 20 min. Data were evaluated using Wyatt's ASTRA software package. e aF-FFF/MALS fractograms of the HES types are com- pared in Figure 1. Corresponding to normal mode Flow-FFF theory, samples with smaller average molar mass elute faster. In Figure 2, the molar mass distributions are given as cumulative weight fraction plots. As is evident in the plots, monomodal dis-tributions were successfully achieved. e values covered a range from approximately 20 kDa to approximately 600 kDa and up to 2 GDa in size, depending on the characterized HES type. us, the average molar mass value was mainly inTuenced by high mo-lar mass fractions. is was also indicated by higher polydispersity values for HES types with higher molar mass. Asymmetrical FFF/MALS is, therefore, an excellent method for characterizing medical polysaccharides such as HES. e main advantage of this technique is that molar mass distributions can be determined from absolute values over an extremely wide range of masses.

The success of chiral method development depends on the intro-duction of appropriate columns. The RegisPack\u00ae poly-saccharide-based chiral stationary phase (CSP) is most successful in achieving a majority of chiral separations. However, there are cases in which this proven chiral se-lector leads to partial or no separation. Excellent separa-tions using the newly introduced RegisPack\u00ae CLA-1 CSP have been obtained for a range of compounds, either by improving or complementing RegisPack's selectivity. This study used the well-established the new chlorinated RegisPack\u00ae CLA-1 CSP . Both phases were based on 5-\u00b5m silica. Columns were both 25 cm x 4.6 mm in size. Te RegisPack\u00ae and RegisPack\u00ae CLA-1 are tris-(5-chloro-2-methylphenyl) carbamate of amylose, respectively. Tis study investigated several compounds that had poor or no separation on a RegisPack\u00ae column. Tey were screened on the new RegisPack\u00ae CLA-1 column. Following are some chromato-graphic illustrations and a tabular summary of our results. Conclusion Te RegisPack\u00ae is a well-established CSP that does a superior job of separating the majority of compounds submitted for chiral screening. Tere are cases where the RegisPack\u00ae CSP can only achieve partial or no separation on some analytes. Te new Reg-isPack\u00ae CLA-1 can exhibit unique selectivity in separation when existing CSP's fail. Tis CSP is highly recommended to be added to the screening process.

KG and 2Agilent Technologies R&D and Marketing GmbH & Co. KG This application note describes the method for detec- tion of nanogram levels of explosive constituents in seawater samples (e.g., after detonation of unexplod-ed ordnance devices). The improved chromatographic method was developed using the Agilent 1290 Innity LC Method Development system. Long after World War II, unexploded ordnance devices are some- times found, not only in the ground but also near the coasts, such as in the Baltic Sea. Tese old munitions are often corroded and cannot be deactivated; sometimes, the only way to deactivate is with a controlled detonation. Te residues of the detonation that can be found in the water must be monitored because of their tox-icity. Tis application note describes the method for detection of nanogram levels of explosive constituents in seawater samples. Te improved chromatographic method was developed using the Agi-lent 1290 Innity LC Method Development system. Experimental LC System For method development and analysis of the samples, an Agilent 1290 Innity LC system was used. Te system consists Innity Binary pump with Innity Diode Array Detec-tor with 10- and 60-mm 3.35 min in Figure 1). Results and Discussion Te explosives analyzed in this application are very polar but not water-soluble substances, and are not well separated on typical RP18 columns. Terefore, dierent RP columns, including more polar materials, were systematically screened using the Agilent 1290 Inn-ity Method Development system. Great selectivity dierences can be seen between the unpolar phases like Eclipse Plus C18, Eclipse Plus Phenyl-Hexyl, Poroshell EC-C18, and Stable Bond C18. Only the Phenyl-Hexyl column shows separation of more than four of the explosives. Te polar RP-phases are more useful. In particular, the critical pair 2,4- and 2,6-dinitrotoluol is only completely separated on the Bonus RP and the SB-AQ, but with the disadvantage of co-elution of TNT and Tetryl. Te best separation with a simple gradient was achieved with the Stable Bond CN column, and therefore, this phase was used for further optimization. Te nal method separates all explosives within 7 min. A further improvement in sensitivity was achieved by using the new 60-mm high sensitivity flow cell. Figure 1 shows the chromatograms of the 5 \u00b5g/ml standard with the 10 mm cell (data not shown) and the 60 mm high sensitivity cell. If the detec-tion wavelength is changed from 235 nm to 214 nm, the influence of the eluent might be increased. However, the sensitivity for 2,3-DND-MB, nitropenta, and nitroglycerine is further increased. Conclusion Te new Agilent 1290 Innity LC is designed to provide the highest speed, resolution, and sensitivity. Te transfer of a standard method to determine eight explosives on sub-2-\u00b5m RRHD or RRHT columns could be done \"overnight\" by identifying the best selectivity using the Agilent Method Development system. Te results show that the analy-sis could be shortened to 7 min without any matrix influences.min 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 mAU 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 RDX HMX 2,4-DNT TNT 2,6-DNT Nitroglycerin Nitropenta Tetryl Figure of the 5 \u00b5g/ml standard with the 60-mm high sensitivity cell at 235 Chromatographic conditions: Sta-tionary Stable Bond phase A: Water; Mobile phase B: Acetonitrile; Gradient: at 0 min 20 % B, at 6 min 40 % B, at 7 min 40 % B; Flow rate: 0.5 mL/min; Data rate: 20 Hz.THE APPLICATION NOTEBOOK - JUNE 2011 Master 21 THE APPLICATION NOTEBOOK - JUNE 2011 Environmental 21 Dionex Corporation 1228 Titan Way, P .O.

Schnute, Dionex Corporation Endothall is a widely used herbicide for both terrestrial and aquatic weeds. Exposure to endothall in excess of the maximum contamination level (MCL) can cause illness. Endothall is regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 100 ppb in drinking water, and by the Cali-fornia EPA at 0.58 mg/L, or 580 ppb, as the Public Health Goal. Current analytical methods described in EPA method 548.1 for the quantitation of endothall in water samples in-volve time-consuming sample preparation and derivatization followed by a 20-min analysis by GC-MS or GC-FID. is study describes the direct analysis of trace levels of endo- thall in water samples by ion chromatography mass spectrometry (IC-MS). Water samples were directly injected for analysis and chromatographic separation was reduced to 10 min. e MSQ Plus Mass Spectrometer was operated in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode, allowing minimum sample cleanup and ensuring sensitive (low ppb) and selective quantiTcation. Isotope labeled glutaric acid (Glutarate-d 6) was used as the internal standard to ensure quantitation accuracy.

The impact of ionic strength and organic content in the mobile phase is discussed. Diquat (6,7-Dihydrodipyrido[1,2-a:2',1'-c]pyrazinediium di-bromide) is an extremely polar compound, Figure 1, and com- monly used as a nonselective contact herbicide. Diquat is a doubly charged cationic analyte. Dierent separation techniques have been used over time like gas chromatography, electrophoresis, and reversed phase (RP) liquid chromatography. Te most common procedure used to be RP-chromatography with addition of ion-pairing (IP) re-agents. Most RP-columns are silica based, where presence of residual silanol groups imposes secondary interactions, causing peak tailing. IP reagents are added to the mobile phase to enhance the retention, to mask unwanted secondary interactions, and to improve the analyte peak shape. Presence of IP reagents in the mobile phase decreases the sensitivity, especially when combined with mass spectrometric (MS) detection. IP reagents often show an eect of ion-suppression, decreas-ing the quantity of ions that reaches the MS. To aid better detection, alternative separation techniques are therefore sought. An attractive alternative is hydrophilic interaction liquid chroma- tography (HILIC), where a polar stationary phase is used in combina-tion with aqueous-organic mobile phases. In HILIC mode, the elution order is usually the opposite of reversed-phase chromatography, oer-ing an increased retention of polar and hydrophilic solutes. Tis means that IP reagents are not needed and coupling to MS detection is eased. Tis application note focuses on the retention of diquat on a polymeric bonded zwitterionic HILIC stationary phase, the eect of ionic strength and percentage of the organic content in the mobile phase is discussed. Experimental Conditions Column: ZIC\u00ae-pHILIC 150 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5mMobile phase compositions are given in each gure legend.Flow rate: 1.0 mL/minTemperature: 40 C Detection: with a bonded zwitterionic sta-tionary phase was chosen for the separation of diquat, to alleviate silanol interactions with the model compound. After initial scouting experiments, a mobile phase with acetonitrile and ammonium acetate (40:60; v/v) was selected. Te pH was set at 3.7, and the impact of ionic strength was evaluated. Due to the electrostatic interactions be-tween diquat and the stationary phase, the retention was strong at lower ionic strength, and as the salt concentration was raised, narrower, more symmetrical peaks were attained along with overall shorter retention. To further optimize the separation, the proportion of organic solvent was varied (see Figure 1). Te retention factor for diquat increased from 1.5 to 7 when the acetonitrile content was raised from 40 to 70 volume percent in the mobile phase. Te peak symmetry was very good for all compositions; hence it was easy to modulate the retention and to obtain useful experimental conditions for any detection mode. Conclusion Separation of extremely polar compounds like diquat is straightfor-ward using a bonded polymeric zwitterionic stationary phase. Altering ionic strength and organic content in the mobile phase, the retention of diquat can easily be modulated and to allow for sensitive detection.

PCBs are a group of synthetic organic chemicals that contain 209 individual compounds (known as congeners) with varying harm- ful eects. PCBs enter the environment as mixtures containing a variety of individual components. PCBs have been widely used as coolants and lubricants in transformers, capacitors, and other electrical equipment. Te manufacture of PCBs stopped due to evidence that PCBs build up in the environment and cause harmful eects. Due their extreme toxic-ity, durability, and wide industrial use, PCBs have found their way into drinking water supplies.

Due to the increasing number of toxic pesticides be- ing used throughout the world, a robust method for positively identifying low levels of multiple classes of pesticides is required. A Zebron ZB-MultiResidue column is used with GC-MS to identify over 100 com-mon pesticides. There is an increasing amount of trade in agricultural products, resulting in a greater need to regulate those exports/imports for toxic chemicals like pesticides. Many countries importing foods are striving for testing protocols that account for the varia-tion of pesticides being used as well as dierent regulations of other exporting countries. To this end, a widely accepted method of pesticide residue identiTcation and quantitation relies on a screening approach using GC-MS. Multiresidue screening analyses are typically extracted using QuEChERS, which do not fractionate residues into separate classes. fle large number of resulting compounds must be sepa-rated in one chromatographic run. A GC-MS is used to separate and positively identify compounds as well as give low detection limits. For this work, a column speciTcally designed for multiple pes- ticide detection is used, the ZB-MultiResidue-1. fle column was developed using a new stationary phase unlike any commercially available columns today. fle column is also MS certiTed making it ideal for use with GC-MS for multiresidue pesticide methods. Experimental Conditions A Zebron ZB-MultiResidue column of 30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm ID \u00d7 0.25 \u00b5m dimensions (Phenomenex, Torrance, was used in an Agilent 6890 with 5973 MSD (Palo Alto, California). fle splitless injection of 1.0 \u00b5L of 1 ppm analytes was made with constant ow helium at 0.9 mL/min. fle oven program was 80 \u00b0C for 0.5 min to 150 \u00b0C @ 10 \u00b0C/min to 240 \u00b0C @ 4 \u00b0C/ min to 320 \u00b0C @ 15 \u00b0C/min for 3 min. Results fle chromatogram for a multi-pesticide screen is presented in Figure 1. flis chromatogram contains 112 of the most com-monly detected pesticides, including chlorinated, nitrogen, and phosphorous-containing pesticides classes. Typical chromatograms using 5% phenyl phases can have clusters of coeluting peaks in the center of the chromatogram. fle unique selectivity of the ZB-MultiResidue-1 column oers improved separation of previously clustered peaks. Fewer coelu-tions are advantageous for sensitive SIM methods because fewer peaks are included in the SIM window. flis results in easier iden-tiTcation, greater signal to noise, and lower detection limits. fle column is also MS certiTed, providing low bleed in sensi- tive MS detectors. flis lowers noise levels for later-eluting com-pounds like permethrins, making detection and quantitation easier. Conclusions A pesticide multiresidue screening method is presented using a new gas chromatographic column (Zebron ZB-MultiResidue) coupled with mass spectrometry. flis method provides for improved ana-lyte separation which can result in easier SIM method development as well as improved quantitation. In addition, this MS certiTed col-umn provides low bleed to reduce instrument maintenance and provide better detection limits for later-eluting compounds.

Because of the poor purge eTciency of the analyte, normal purge and trap methods must be modied to detect 1,4-dioxane at the part-per-billion level. flis method also utilizes an Agilent 7890A/5975C with T riple Axis Detector in Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM) mode to provide the increased sensitivity required by this low-level analysis. For this study, an Atomx Automated Sample Prep System was used in conjunction with a GC-MS system. flis \"all-in-one\" autosampler allows for complete automation of sample preparation for the analysis of soil and liquid samples for purge and trap. flrough the features the Atomx provides, such as the 80-position sample tray and standard addition vessels, eTciency and throughput can be greatly increased, leading to cost and time savings. Utilizing an Agilent 7890/5975 GC-MS system, a linear calibration was performed and percent relative standard deviation (%RSD) and MDLs were determined for 1,4-dioxane, using a 5-mL purge volume. Experimental Conditions fle Atomx Automated Sample Prep System was coupled to an Agilent 7890A/5975 GC-MS with T riple Axis Detector for analysis. Teledyne Tekmar's proprietary #9 trap was the analytical trap utilized. fle GC was congured with an Agilent DB-624 20 1.0 \u00b5m column. A 50-ppm working calibration standard was prepared in methanol. Calibration standards were prepared in 50-mL volumetric asks lled to volume with de-ionized water over a range of 1-500 ppb. Samples were transferred to headspace-free 40-mL vials for analysis. fle internal standard (IS) was prepared in methanol at a 50 ppm concentration and added to each sample, bringing the nal concentration of 50 ppb. Agilent Chemstation software was used to process the calibration data.Results and ConclusionsRelative response factors were evaluated for linearity and %RSD, which were 0.9998 and 5.12, respectively. fle MDL was also established at 0.74 ppb for 1,4-dioxane by analyzing seven replicates at a concentration of 5 ppb. An extracted ion chromatogram for 10 ppb 1,4-dioxane standard can be found in Figure 1. flroughput is a major factor in lab eTciency, and therefore, protability. Automation and optimized purge and trap methods can greatly reduce sample preparation and overall cycle times. flis study demonstrates the capabilities of the Teledyne Tekmar Atomx Automated Sample Prep System coupled with 7890/5975 GC-MS to detect 1,4-dioxane at the ppb level. By optimizing the purge parameters, without compromising sensitivity, throughput can be greatly increased, leading to cost and time savings.

Table I: Representative analyte recoveries data (800) 385-3153 E-mail: methods@unitedchem.com Website: www.unitedchem.comTHE APPLICATION NOTEBOOK - JUNE 2011 Food and Beverage 27 This note describes the use of the AB Sciex T ripleTOF 5600 LC-MS-MS system and data processing using the XIC Man- ager software to screen extracts of fruit and vegetable samples for pesticide residues. Detected compounds were automatically iden-tied based on retention times, accurate mass, isotopic pattern, and MS-MS library searching. Experimental Conditions Fruit and vegetable samples were extracted using a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, eective, rugged, and safe) procedure (1,2). Ex-tracts were diluted 5\u00d7 using the aqueous mobile phase to optimize chromatographic peak shape and minimize possible ion suppres-sion eects. UHPLC separation was achieved using a Shimadzu UFLCXR system with a Restek Ultra Aqueous C18 3 m (100 \u00d7 2.1 mm) column and a 15 min gradient of water and methanol with ammonium formate buer. Te AB Sciex T ripleTOF 5600 system equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source was used. Full scan TOF-MS spectra were acquired over a mass range of 100-1000 Da with an accumulation time of 100 ms. TOF-MS-MS spectra were automatically acquired throughout the chromato-graphic run using standardized collision energy settings of CE = 35V and CES = 15 V. Results and Discussion A total number of 289 targeted pesticides were analyzed using high resolution and accurate mass LC-MS-MS. LC-MS-MS data were processed using the XIC Manager software which calculates the expected molecular ion based on molecular formula, isotope, and adduct provided. Extracted ion chromatograms (XIC) of each pes-ticide were automatically generated using an extraction window of \u00b1 10 mDa around the expected retention time and compared to a specied intensity threshold. Te AB Sciex T ripleTOF 5600 LC-MS-MS system routinely operates with a resolution (full width at half height) of ~20000 at m/z 200 Da to ~40000 at m/z 1000 Da and with a mass accuracy of ~1 ppm (0.1 to 1 mDa, depending on m/z). Dierent fruit and vegetable samples obtained from a supermar- ket were analyzed and processed. An established MS-MS library was used for pesticide identication (3). Figure 1 shows an example of identication of imidacloprid, metalaxyl, apirotetramat, and cypro-dinil in a Chinese broccoli sample based on retention times, accurate mass, isotopic pattern, and MS-MS library searching with a purity > 80%.Summary Te AB Sciex T ripleTOF 5600 LC-MS-MS system provides a high sensitivity platform to screen for and identify pesticide residues in fruit and vegetable extracts. Te high resolution and accurate mass data can be automatically mined by the XIC Manager software to provide high condence compound identication by combining retention times, accurate mass MS, and MS-MS data.

In ad-dition, 4-MI is listed as a carcinogen by the California Oce of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) in Janu-ary 2011 with a calculated No SigniTcant Risk Level (NSRL) of 16 g per person per day (3). us, the quantitation of these two carcinogens in foods is of particular importance for food safety and human health. Conventional methods for identiTcation of 2-MI and 4-MI in caramel color include gas chromatography methods which involve labor intensive procedures (4). Liquid chromatographic methods have also been reported for 4-MI analysis (5). This study demonstrates simultaneous quantitation of 2- and 4-methylimidazoles in carbonated drinks by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrom-etry (UHPLC MS-MS). Experimental e analyses were performed on a Dionex UltiMate\u00ae 3000 Rapid Separation Liquid Chromatography UHPLC system. Separation was achieved on an Acclaim\u00ae T rinity P1 mixed-mode column (2.1 \u00d7 50 mm) with isocratic elution at 0.5 mL/min. e mobile phase consisted of 10% methanol in pH 5.7 ammonium acetate buer (total buer concentration at 5 mM). Column temperature was maintained at 15 \u00b0C. A ermo ScientiTc TSQ Quantum Access with heated electrospray ionization source (HESI) was operated in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode with the settings listed with the chromatogram. Vaporizer temperature was set at 350 \u00b0C and capillary temperature was set at 200 \u00b0C. Sheath gas and auxiliary gas were both set at 60 arbitrary units. Results As shown in Figure 1 (right), two target analytes were baseline separated on the T rinity P1 column. Both analytes were observed with the same two SRM transitions with dierent responses; the SRM with stronger response was used for quantitation (Q-SRM) and the other was used for conTrmation (C-SRM). e ratio of the two SRM responses was used as additional conTrmation to avoid possible false positives. Figure 1 (left) also demonstrates the direct analysis of a diluted dark carbonated drink after ten-fold dilution with positive detection of 4-MI. is diluted sample was re-analyzed after spiking with 100 ppb of each 2-MI and 4-MI, with the result showing in Figure 1 (right).

Pomegranate juice (PJ) is a major anthocyanin source and, therefore, very popular in health drinks. But, because of the short supply of pomegranates, adulteration of PJ is widespread. Tis study describes a sensitive, fast, and accurate method to deter-mine anthocyanins in commercially available PJ with a simple di-lution and separation on a Dionex Acclaim\u00ae C18 RSLC column followed by detection at Dionex UltiMate\u00ae 3000 Rapid Separation LC System was used for this study. For individual components of the system and preparation of solutions, please refer to Dionex Application Note 264 (1). Results and Discussion Figure 1a shows the separation of six signature anthocyanins in 100% PJ. Te sample was diluted 1:5 to prevent overloading. Grape juice is one of several juices used to adulterate PJ. Tere-fore, a 50:50 mixture of grape and 100% PJ were used in this study to simulate an adulterated sample. Te chromatogram in Figure 1a shows a separation of six anthocyanins characteristic to PJ ranging in concentrations from 2.1 to 73 g/mL. Te sim-ulated adulterated sample in Figure 1b shows the six signature anthocyanins and several late eluting peaks that are not character-istic of PJ. Te gure illustrates how the method could be used to identify adulterated samples. Adulterated juices often show un-characteristic concentration ratios of signature anthocyanins and additional peaks not present in pure PJ. To evaluate accuracy, the juices were spiked with known amounts of the six anthocyanins. Recoveries ranged from 98.0% to 108.3%, suggesting good method accuracy.

Experimental A Dionex UltiMate\u00ae 3000 Rapid Separation LC (RSLC) system was used; for system components and preparation of solutions, please refer to Dionex Application Note 275 (1). Results and Discussion Figure 1a shows the catechins present in a commercially available green tea. e most abundant catechin in this green tea is EGCG, which is about 50% of the total catechin content, at 135.4 mg/g. Figure 1b shows an analysis of black tea, where, unlike green tea, the EGC concentration is higher than the EGCG content and the total catechin content is 63.3 mg/g, nearly 50% less than that of the green tea. e caTeine levels are also higher in black tea as compared to green tea. Both the lower total catechin concentration and the higher caTeine concentrations are consistent with the in-creased processing of black tea. To evaluate method accuracy, the teas were spiked with known amounts of the seven catechins. Recoveries ranged from 90.2% to 102.3%, suggesting method accuracy.

It is also produced during the heat treatment of foods from the dehydra-tion of sugars such as glucose and fructose (1). Its presence is used as an indicator for spoilage, excessive heat-treatment, and adulteration. Many countries have imposed restrictions on the maximum levels of HMF in food and beverages because of the carcinogenic potential of similar compounds. Commonly used HMF determination methods are based on spectral absorbance at 284 nm; however, direct absorbance mea- surements could have interferences from other compounds present in complex matrices. Here, we present a high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with HMF . is meth-od exhibits broad linearity, low detection limits, high precisions, and good recovery of HMF , indicating that PAD is an appropriate detec-tion technique for HMF . Equipment A Dionex ICS-3000 system was used in this study. HMF (10 L) was separated on a CarboPac\u00ae PA1 column set, with electrolyti-cally generated 50 mM hydroxide at 0.5 mL/min, and detected by PAD. e CarboPac PA1, a high capacity rugged column, de-livered high resolution for HMF in a variety of matrices. Samples were prepared according to procedures described in Dionex Ap-plication Note 270 (2). Results Figure 1(A) shows HMF (in a thermally stressed honey sample) de- tected at 4.8 min without interference from the other sugars. Figure 1(C) shows the separation of HMF from other degradation products in thermally stressed pancake syrup. HMF is a product of thermal degradation of fructose, the main constituent of pancake syrup. Complex matrices, such as syrup, may have later eluting peaks (at ~55 min in pancake syrup; not shown), which could interfere with subsequent injections if a shorter run time is used. is method was also applied for HMF detection in fructose. (HMF , present as an impurity in fructose, must be quantied and meet FCC and USP requirements before use as a food substance or in infusion Tuids.) Figure 1(B) shows the separation of HMF from other thermal degra-dation products in fructose. e described method was linear in the range of 0.1-50 g/mL. e LOD and LOQ were 0.04 g/mL and 0.10 g/mL, respectively. Retention time and peak area precisions were 0.5%, which can be attributed to consistent generation of high purity hydroxide by the eluent generator. Accuracy of the method was veried by determining recoveries of HMF in spiked honey over three days (average recovery 103%). Conclusion e described HPAE-PAD based method is accurate, reliable, re-quires no manual eluent preparation, and because of good sensitivity and consistent response, can be adapted for routine HMF analysis.

Experimental Conditions Eight baby foods make up 96% of all sales from the three main food manufacturers (1). T wo vegetables, green beans and sweet po-tatoes, and two fruits, pears and peaches, were used in this study. A 100-g aliquot of each sample was extracted by the Luke proce- dure (2), and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was exchanged into 1.5 mL hexane for immediate GC-MS analysis. e second aliquot was exchanged into 10 mL of solvent for GPC cleanup. e GPC column was packed with Envirobeads S-X3 swollen with 1:1 cyclohexane:ethyl acetate and calibrated according to U.S. EPA Meth-od 3640 to determine collection time for the pesticide residue fraction.

International regulations on maximum residue levels (MRLs) of pesticides in food cover hundreds of indi-vidual contaminants at the 10 ppb or below range. The analysis of citrus oil for pesticide contamination holds specic challenges. Pesticides that are used on citrus crops are concentrated along with the matrix in this oil. Tis matrix is known for its high boiling point components. Te system of the Termo Scientic TRACE GC Ultra and TSQ Quantum XLS GC-MS-MS allows for the analysis of more than 40 pesticides in citrus oil with mini-mal sample preparation. Experimental Conditions Te samples were diluted 20-to-1 using hexane. Te samples for method development and calibration curve were made by spiking the list of pesticides into a known clean sample. Te TRACE GC Ultra PTV injector with backush was the in- jector chosen due to the heavy contamination potential from the cit-rus oil matrix. During the method development process it was found that there was a signicant amount of high boiling point matrix. All selected reaction monitoring (SRM) transitions were opti- mized for best collision energy and full conversion from precursor to product ion for monitoring. Each analyte had at least one con-rming ion. Te information for these transitions as provided by the Termo Scientic Pesticide Analyzer Reference. Te function of timed-SRM was used to allow the instrument to automatically determine the most ecient use of its time. Te timed-SRM function of the TSQ Quantum XLS system provides more points across the peaks with better sensitivity and precision. Te method used for the analysis was a 1 L injection of the citrus oil, diluted 20:1 in hexane. Te TRACE GC Ultra PTV backush time was set to the point just after the last compound of interest was loaded onto the analytical column. All samples used in the method development and calibration curve were in the citrus oil. Te calibration curve ranged from 10 to 200 ppb. Results In the nal developed method, the last peak of the more than 40 pesticides eluted in less than 20 min. Te extracted standards showed better than 0.995 r 2 values for the correlation coecient. Te peaks shown with the curves show the low point on the cali-bration curve, at 10 ppb, extracted from the citrus oil matrix. Six matrix samples were spiked at 25 ppb level. Tese samples were analyzed and the areas were used to demonstrate stability of the nal method, including backush. Te relative standard devia-tions for the areas ranged from 0.69% to 3.68%. Conclusion Te use of PTV with backush allowed the development of a method with very little sample preparation. Backush of the PTV kept all of the high-boiling-point contamination from reaching any part of the analytical system, reducing maintenance. It also provided an increased sample throughput by decreasing time needed for sample or system cleanup. Te timed-SRM function of the TSQ Quantum XLS provided the most ecient use of the instrument time, only monitoring the expected SRMs when needed. Te timed-SRM function provided the precision needed for the low level analysis of pesticides in citrus oil.

Analysis methods for biogenic amines include HPLC with Tuo-rescence detection \u2014 using derivatization with dansyl chloride or o-phthalaldehyde. e drawbacks to these methods are a 40- min analysis time, sample pretreatment that requires Tuores-cence derivatization, and liquid phase extraction. In this study, we investigated a simple, highly sensitive, and direct analytical method that does not require derivatization and uses a TSKgel Amide-80 column under HILIC conditions followed by MS-MS detection (Figure 1). Experimental conditions LC System : Agilent 1200SL Series Column: TSKgel Amide-80, 3 2.0 15 Mobile phase: A: min Results and Discussion Figure 2 and Table I detail the results of the analysis of six bio-genic amines. Excellent separation of the analytes and linearity of the calibration curves were obtained. When compared to a fluorescence method using a reversed phase column (data not shown), this LC-MS-MS method can be completed in half the analysis time (20 min versus 40 min). The limits of quantita-tion for the analytes were 0.001-0.02 mg in a 100 g sample, an improvement of 5-1300 times compared with the fluorescence method.

Table II lists the quantitative values of biogenic amines in tuna preserved for two days at freezing and room temperatures. Good correlation was obtained between the two methods. Conclusions A new LC-MS-MS method for the analysis of biogenic amines was investigated by Tosoh scientists. Six biogenic amines were ana-lyzed in 15 min under HILIC conditions using a TSKgel Amide-80 column without the need for a complex and time-consuming de-rivatization procedure. Limits of quantitation of the analytes were improved 5-1300 times using this new method compared with the conventional uorescence method. Since good correlation between the two methods was obtained in a comparative study of quantita-tive values, the LC-MS-MS method is a proven alternative method that is both simple and sensitive for the analysis of biogenic amines in food products.

Fluoride, ni-trate, sulfate, and acetate are determined by conduc-tivity detection after chemical suppression, while the silicon present in the form of hexafluorosilicate is de-tected spectrophotometrically as molybdosilicic acid after derivatization in the same analysis. The analyti-cal results are validated by titration. Energy production from renewable sources such as biomass, biogas, biofuels, water, wind, and solar power is becoming increasingly important in our energy-hungry society. Particular interest is given to solar energy, which by human criteria is inex-haustible. Solar cells used in photovoltaic units convert the radia-tion energy in sunlight directly into electric energy. Solar cells are manufactured from ultrapure mono- or poly- crystalline silicon wafers whose surface is treated in acid etching baths (also known as texturing baths) before being spiked with foreign atoms (P , B). Te etching solutions consist of various acids, which act as an oxidizing agent and determine the surface structure and thus the eciency of the solar cells. Te replenishment of components used up in the etching process extends the bath life and saves costs, though it does require knowledge of the exact composition of the bath, especially the concentration of silicon and hexafluorosilicate. By using titration and ion chromatogra-phy (IC), it is possible to determine the key components quickly and precisely. Tis article describes an ion chromatographic method that separates all relevant components in the bath on an anion- exchange column and identies them by dual detection in a single run. After suppressed conductivity detection of the acid anions, the undissociated silicic acid reacts in a post-column reaction (PCR) to form molybdosilicic acid, which is determined spectro-photometrically at 410 nm. Te concentrations of fluoride and hexafluorosilicate are determined by way of a simple stoichiomet-ric calculation that is performed by the chromatography software. 12 1110 9876543210Conductivity (\u00b5S/cm) Time (min)0 2 4 acetate nitrate 14 16Separation column: Sample volume: 1.5 \u00b5L 18 20 22 24 26 28 Figure 1: 850 Professional IC Anion - MCS and 858 Professional Sample Processor.Figure 2: Conductivity of simulated etching bath with mg/L mg/L acetate, and 10 mg/L nitrate.

Dual Detection Te acid anions present in the etching bath \u2014 mainly fluoride and nitrate, though sometimes also sulfate and acetate \u2014 are separated under alkaline elution conditions and determined by conductivity detection (Figure 2).

Na 2SiF6 \u2014> Si(OH)4 + 6 NaF Te undissociated orthosilicic acid is determined by way of post-column reaction with an acid molybdate solution and subse- quent UV-vis detection at 410 nm MoO42 + 24 H+ \u2014> H4[Si(Mo3O10)4] + 12 H2O Te injection of SiF62 produces a fluoride peak in the con- ductivity detector and a silicate peak in the UV-vis detector. Te mass balance derived from the respective peak areas conrms that the concentration of SiF 62 results stoichiometrically from the de- termined fluoride and silicate concentrations, provided there are no other sources of fluoride or silicate present. Tus the concen-tration of free HF can be calculated as the dierence between the total fluoride concentration and the fluoride concentration from the hexafluorosilicate: [HF] = [F ]total [F]hexafluorosilicate Analysis of the Texturing Baths and Validation After being diluted at ratios between 1:1000 and 1:5000, four sam- ples from dierent texturing baths are analysed for their constitu-ents by using the above IC method with dual detection. Figure 4 shows the chromatograms of etching bath sample 1 obtained by (a) conductivity and (b) UV-vis detection. Table I provides an overview of the concentrations of the rel- evant bath components determined by ion chromatography with dual detection. For comparison, the concentrations obtained by titration are also shown. Te potentiometric determination of acid concentrations and H 2SiF6 content was carried out using aqueous acid-base titration with 1 mol/L NaOH solution.Conclusion Ion chromatography with dual detection allows determining the concentration of all relevant constituents of texturing baths for solar cell production in less than 30 min. Te acids consumed in the texturing process can subsequently be replenished in a tar-geted way. Tis extends the life of the etching baths, guarantees clean and reproducible wafer surfaces, cuts costs, and protects the environment. References (1) A. Henssge and J.

Te CPSC test method species GC- MS analysis in the SIM mode to monitor for low-intensity ions that are unique to speciflc phthalate esters, but full-scan mass spectra are valuable in qualitative identiflcation. Operation of the mass spec-trometer in the FASST Scan/SIM mode allows concurrent acquisi - tion of full-scan and SIM mass spectral data, to provide improved qualitative identiflcation while still maintaining optimum sensitivity. T wo of the regulated compounds are mixtures of isomers, and quantitation ions for these compounds are of very low relative inten- sity. So trace detection for these two substances is more challenging than for the other regulated compounds. Terephthalate esters (non-regulated isomers of phthalate esters) are frequently present at high concentration in real-world samples and interfere with identiflcation and quantitation of several of the regulated phthalate esters. Analysis on an alternate column provides chromatographic resolution of interferences from the regulated phthalate esters.

Under these conditions, DOTP is well resolved from the regulated phthalate esters. Te chromatographic separation of the phthalate esters is also very good on the RXI-17SilMS column, but elution of butyl benzyl phthalate is much later on this column.

Te main techniques used for drug monitor-ing and analysis are immunoassays, LC, and GC methods. Mass spectral chromatographic methods are the rst choice for many applications based on their flexibility, selectivity, sensitivity, quali-tative, and quantitative capabilities. Analysis of pharmaceuti-cals in biological samples requires sample preparation that can range from simple protein precipitation (PPT) to more complex solid-phase extraction (SPE). Tere is a need in classic sample preparation for an approach to determine multi-classes of phar-maceuticals in biological samples. Polymeric or mixed-mode SPE sorbents which can isolate acidic, neutral, and basic drugs by hy-drophobic or ion-exchange interactions have addressed this void but there is always room for sample preparation techniques that are rapid and inexpensive to implement. In 2003, Anastassiades and colleagues. reported a method for the analysis of multiresidue pesticides in foods known as QuECh-ERS; which equates to a quick, easy, cheap, eective, rugged, and safe sample preparation approach (1). Te authors reported out-standing recoveries for a wide range of pesticide classes (1). Since its inception there have been many reported articles employing QuEChERS for the analysis of a wide range of compounds in-cluding, but not specic to: antibiotics (2), toxins (3), contami-nants (4), and pharmaceuticals (5). Experimental In this application note we describe an extension of the work presented by Pl\u00f6ssl and colleagues in 2006 (5), for the determi-nation of pharmaceuticals in whole blood resulting in a modi-ed mini-QuEChERS procedure with LC-MS-MS analysis. Te experiments used whole blood from human donors and evaluated both nonbuered and buered extraction salts of the QuEChERS method, namely the Original, AOAC 2007.01 and EN 15662. Modications to the acetonitrile (extraction sol-vent) used in the rst step (extraction/partitioning) were also evaluated (Table I). Te experiments were performed using nine range of hydrophobicity and dissociation constants, pK a. The general procedure is as follows. A 1 mL aliquot of whole blood was added to a centrifuge tube and spiked with appro-priate volume from a concentrated stock mixture to yield 25, 50, and 100 ng/mL of the component mix, add 20 uL of IS stock solution (nortriptyline), two ceramic homogenizers then vortex. Then 2 mL of acetonitrile solutions (with or without acid) was added and vortexed. A premixed amount (see Table I) of the extraction salts is added and vigorously shaken, cen-trifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. One milliliter of the extract is transferred into a d-SPE tube (2 mL centrifuge tube) contain-ing 50 mg of PSA and 100 mg of MgSO 4 for matrix clean-up; vortex for 1 min and centrifuge at 18,000 rpm for 3 min. A 200 \u00b5L aliquot of the extract is transferred into a LC vial containing 800 uL of water, vortexed and analyzed. A matrix matched calibration curve from 10-250 ng/mL was employed to determine recovery. Results The experiments showed that the use of ACN (0.4% FA) as the extraction solvent offered a better lysed sample versus the other extraction solvents where the sample became a solid mass. The AOAC buffered salts yielded the cleanest extract, visually and was chosen to be used with the d-SPE containing 50 mg PSA, 150 mg MgSO 4 for the extraction of the phar- maceuticals in whole blood. Typical chromatogram shown in Figure 1 is the analysis of a 10 ng/mL whole blood sample after mini-QuEChERS procedure.Analysis of Pharmaceuticals in Whole Blood by Poroshell 120, Using a Modied Mini-QuEChERS Approach for Sample Preparation Joan Stevens, Agilent Technologies, Inc. x103 5.1 5 4.9 4.8 4.7 4.6 4.5 4.4 4.3 4.2 4.1 4 3.9 3.8 3.7 3.6 3.5 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 3 2.92.82.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 2.1 2 1.9 1.8 1.7 1.6 1.5 1.41.3 1.2 1.1 1 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.50.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 Counts vs. Acquistion Time (min)1.8 1.9 2 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 4 3 extraction; AOAC (NaAc) and d-SPE (PSA).THE APPLICATION NOTEBOOK 2011 Pharmaceutical 43 Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2850 Centerville Road, Wilmington, DE 19808 tel. 227-9770, Rate: acetate, pH 5 mM Ammonium over 5.5 min Te mini-QuEChERS approach has shown to be a viable sam-ple preparation technique for the analysis of pharmaceuticals in biologicals like whole blood as shown with average recoveries > 90% and 7% RSDs for 50-100 ng/mL, in Table II. Conclusion Te mini-QuEChERS sample preparation is a simple, easy, and cost eective approach, requiring minimal sample preparation expertise, solvent, equipment, and is a green technology. Te mini-QuEChERS approach for the extraction of pharmaceuticals from whole blood oers an alternative sample preparation tech-nique that is easily implemented into laboratories. Poroshell 120 is an excellent column choice for this analysis, in part because it has standard 2 \u00b5m frits and is more forgiving for more complex samples relative to a sub-2 \u00b5m column. It has mass transfer such that it acts very much like a sub-2 \u00b5m particle LC column, but doesn't have the back pressure. Te eflcient mass transfer equates with faster analysis time and higher throughput, with optimum resolution. References ( 1 ) M . An a s t a s s i a d e s , S . J .

Amikacin is used for in- fections resistant to other aminoglycosides because it is less suscep-tible to enzymatic reactions. PuriTed kanamycin from Streptomyces kanamyceticus is kanamycin A, from which amikacin is synthesized by acylation of the kanamycin A amino group with L-(-)- -amino- -hydroxybutyric acid (L-HABA). Kanamycin A and L-HABA are, therefore, expected impurities in amikacin syn-thesis. ese antibiotics must meet speciTed purity criteria before clini-cal use. e United States Pharmacopeia (USP) monographs using dispos-able on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) working electrodes with a 4-potential waveform suitable for use with these electrodes. Disposable electrodes are more convenient than conventional elec-trodes because they are easier to install and do not require time-consuming electrode polishing. Compared to other disposable gold electrodes, the gold on PTFE electrodes have longer lifetimes and can operate at the hydroxide concentration used in the USP assays. Experimental A Dionex ICS-3000 system and Chromeleon\u00ae Chromatography Data System software were used in this study. Kanamycin and amikacin (20 \u00b5L) were separated using a CarboPac\u00ae MA1 (USP L47) column set with 115 mM sodium hydroxide at 0.5 mL/min. Results Figure 1 shows the <10 min separation of kanamycin and ami-kacin. Peak resolution was >4, (exceeding the USP requirement of 3); asymmetry for both antibiotics was 1.1 (USP requirement of <2). Retention time RSDs were 0.16 for kanamycin and 0.07 for amikacin for nine replicate injections (USP requirement of <0.3). Intra- and between-day peak area precisions (RSDs) were 0.99 and 1.3 for kanamycin and 1.2 and 2.3 for amikacin. ese values suggest that this method eectively assays these antibiotics without column regeneration, and that using a disposable elec-trode with its associated waveform meets the current USP assay requirements. To demonstrate method capability for stability assays, these anti-biotics were studied after exposure to elevated temperatures under acidic or basic conditions. For both antibiotics, most of the degra-dation products eluted within 10 min. An unidentiTed late-eluting peak at ~21 min is similar to a late-eluting peak reported for de-graded streptomycin (3), which could interfere with quantiTcation if a shorter run time is used. Under basic conditions, amikacin loses its acetylated group resulting in a kanamycin-like molecule. Conclusion is method matches and exceeds USP requirements, achieves good sensitivity, and has high sample throughput. Additionally, using disposable electrodes provide shorter equilibrium time and better electrode-to-electrode reproducibility. References (1) United States Pharmacopeia Sunnyvale, CA.

Due to their wide range of enantiomeric selectivity, a set of polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases (CSPs) was screened to identify methods for the successful enantioseparation of four benzimidazoles; rabepra-zole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, and pantoprazole. Experimental screening protocol was performed on Tve dierent polysaccha-ride-based chiral stationary phases under reversed phase condi-tions using Lux\u00ae 5 \u00b5m columns (Table I). To reduce solvent usage, 150 \u00d7 4.6 mm columns were used for the initial screen. Once the best chiral stationary phase was identiTed for each sample, the mobile phase conditions were further optimized on 250 mm length columns of the same particle size and diameter to get increased resolution. Additional optimization of the chromato-graphic conditions with respect to retention, enantioseparation, and resolution was achieved by variation of the mobile phase con-stituents at room temperature. Results and Conclusions fle HPLC analysis of the four benzimidazoles allows for fast and accurate identiTcation of their enantiomers. We have shown analytical techniques in reversed phase conditions conducive to MS detection for each. Preparative techniques can be explored using these analytical techniques by Trst optimizing mobile phase conditions for best resolution and selectivity followed by loading tests.

Polyolen as a group includes high-density and low-density polyethylene (HDPE, LDPE), polypropylene (PP), EP rubber, and linear low density of ethylene with alpha olens (propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene). Tough chemically simple, being made up of only carbon and hydrogen atoms, PO products derive their wide range of end-use properties from their semicrystalline structure. Te ability to incorporate co-monomers in PE to create short chain branches (SCB) makes it possible to control the polymer crys-tallinity and crystalline morphology, and thus control the rigid-ity and flexibility of PO products. Te controlling factor also depends on the SCB variations across the molar mass distribu-tion (MMD). In dilute solution, the eect of SCB causes a reduction in polymer coil size with an increase of methyl groups o the backbone. Such structural changes can be studied by high tem-perature size exclusion chromatography (SEC, also known as gel permeation chromatography, or GPC), equipped with a multiwavelength infrared detector (IR5 MCT) (1), a light scat-tering (LS) detector, and a viscosity detector in the triple-detec-tor GPC conguration (TD-GPC) (2). Tese techniques allow the analysis of SCB variation across MMD as it is illustrated by using the homopolymer PP and PE samples described in Table I together with their blend. Experimental Conditions Eluent: TCB (stabilized with 300 Polymer detector by Polymer Char. 4-capillary viscometer by Polymer Char.

Since the PP part in the blend sample is of higher MM than the PE part, a higher methyl signal is seen in the higher MM end of the sample, as expected. Te trend of changing ethylene percent, seen in Figure 2, can be predicted a priori from the co-adding of the original PE and PP GPC elution curves. is ethylene to propylene transition also can be determined from the diTerence between the CH 2 and CH3 signals of the IR5 MCT detector (1). e validity of this analytical approach is supported by the agreement seen in the Figure between the predicted and the IR5 MCT results. 2. Ethylene-propylene Composition Analysis by TD-GPC: In the triple detector GPC, the ratio of LS signal over sam-ple concentration at each GPC elution volume gives a mea-sure of the polymer weight-average MM (M w). Similarly, the ratio of the viscosity detector signal over sample con-centration gives the polymer intrinsic viscosity (IV). The plot of Log IV versus Log M w by LS is called the Mark- Houwink (MH) plot, which is an often-used tool to reveal polymer branching and conformational structures (3).Both light scattering and viscosity detector signals are more responsive to higher MM molecules. This is the rea-son that the LS and viscosity curves of the blend sample are skewed more to the higher MM region than the IR concen-tration curve shown in Figure 3. The corresponding MH plots for the three samples are shown in Figure 4. The MH line of the PP sample is seen to have a shift to higher MM from that of the PE sample. This is because of the extra methyl group off the chain backbone that leads to higher MM and lower IV for the PP sample.Te MH plot of the blend sample in Figure 4 is seen to go through a transition from the PE line to the PP line as the MM increases. e experimental data agrees with the predicted curve very well. is agreement supports the use of TD-GPC for study-ing polymer blends and block copolymers of EP (ethyl-ene/octene), and so on. Conclusions e micro-structural diTerence of Polyethylene and Polypropylene as well as the compositional variation in EP can be detected by GPC-IR5 MCT and TD-GPC, as it has been validated by using a test sample of known composition created by a 50-50 PE-PP blend. Tis result of SCB variation across MMD provides the additional poly-mer structural information that complements perfectly the CRYS-TAF (crystallization SCB across the crystalliza-tion temperatures (3-5) and to the cross-fractionation technique (6).

Countless products are being sold at smoke shops, convenience stores, and online sites. ese products are labeled \"not for human consumption,\" but have been reported to have eflects similar to cannabis when smoked. ese reports have prompted testing in crime laboratories across the country. Some of the products tested have been conTrmed to contain syn-thetic cannabinoids. e identiTcation of these compounds by GC-MS can be challenging, as most of them are not present in commercially available mass spectral libraries. A particular prod-uct that received a great deal of media attention in the midwest-ern United States during 2010 was \"Mr. Smiley.\" is product was reported to contain natural substances such as Mullein and Damiana leaf. It was also reported that when smoked, this prod-uct exhibited a \"THC-like\" high. Shortly before this product was pulled from store shelves, some was purchased for analysis to de-termine which compounds may be present. e sample was initially analyzed by GC-TOFMS, but the most abundant analyte detected was not present in the commercially avail-able NIST mass spectral database. is application note shows the use of LECO's Pegasus GC- HRT high resolution time-of-ight mass spectrometer to provide an elemental composition based on accurate mass data, which ultimately lead to identiTcation of the unknown compound. Sample A 1-gram sample of \"Mr. Smiley\" was weighed into a 20-mL vial. A 10-mL aliquot of ethyl acetate was added and the sample was soni-cated for 10 min. Experimental e \"Mr. Smiley\" extract was analyzed on a LECO Pegasus GC-HRT system using the conditions shown below.

Recently, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminis-tration (SAMHSA) has lowered the amphetamine drug class cutofl level and has added MDMA, MDA, and MDEA to the panel. As a re-sult, there will undoubtedly be an increase in positive result conforma-tional testing, placing additional stress on the toxicology laboratory. We demonstrate how a specialized SPE sorbent and method, together with a high eTciency core-shell HPLC column and LC-MS-MS can decrease analysis time and increase sample throughput. Experimental Conditions Urine samples were pretreated and cleaned up using Strata-X-Drug B solid phase extraction tubes. (It is important to note that neither a conditioning or equilibration step is required using this specialized SPE sorbent and method.) After diluting samples by a factor of 20 to bring the concentration into a suitable range for analysis, samples were injected onto the LC-MS-MS. Analyses were performed using an HP 1100 LC system (Agilent T echnologies, Palo Alto, California) with an upper pressure limit of 400 bar, equipped with an API 3000 LC-MS-MS detector. All analytes were present at a concentration of 10 ng/mL each and are listed in order of elution.Column: Kinetex\u00ae 2.6 m XB-C18 100 \u00c5Dimensions: 50 x 2.1 mmMobile Phase: A: 5 mM Ammonium formate with 0.1 % Formic acidB: Methanol with 0.1 % Formic acidGradient: Time (min) %B 0.00 10 1.00 70 Rate: 3000 ESI 8.

The Kinetex \u00ae XB-C18 HPLC/ UHPLC column delivers a fast and effective separation of sev-eral common preservatives in cosmetics. Preservatives prevent product deterioration and deter any possible health risks microorganisms may cause to the consumer; however, a disadvantage of using such agents is that they may cause adverse eects, such as allergic responses and irritation. flere is a need today for a fast, eTcient, and selec-tive HPLC method to screen for such common and dangerous preservatives.

Figure 1 illustrates the ability of the Kinetex XB-C18, 2.6 m core-shell column to rapidly screen and separate all 15 compounds. In this separation, the Kinetex XB-C18 column oered a peak ca-pacity of 445, which was higher than any other column evaluated in the experiment. Peak capacity is the best measure of performance for a gradient separation and high peak capacity values indicate in-creased analyte resolution over a given analysis time. fle core-shell particle morphology allows for faster mass trans- fer of analytes into and out of the stationary phase as compared to fully-porous silica particles. In addition, the very narrow particle size distribution inherent in core-shell silica particles, as compared to fully-porous particles, results in less band broadening. Kinetex 2.6 m XB-C18 was able to separate the chlorinated com- pounds triclosan and triclocarban, which can be challenging. flis is likely due to the unique XB-C18 selectivity. fle Kinetex XB-C18 chemistry contains protective di-isobutyl side chains that shield the sil-ica surface. In addition, the surface is endcapped with trimethylsilane. Analysis of preservatives in cosmetics was accomplished at an operating pressure under 400 bar and may therefore be used on conventional HPLC systems without the need for specialized ultra-high pressure equipment. Conclusion An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of 15 preser-vatives in cosmetics. fle method was developed to achieve the best balance of analysis time and separation. fle Kinetex XB-C18, 2.6 m column provided high peak ca- pacity and the unique selectivity of the XB-C18 was well-suited for the application.

In our work we strived to streamline the barbiturate screening process to provide a fast, cost-eective, and reproducible method from start to flnish for forensic labs who are involved in high-throughput processing. Experimental Conditions Phenobarbital, butalbital, pentobarbital, amobarbital, and secobarbital were spiked into urine samples at 40, 100, and 125% of cuto level (300 ng/mL). Te spiked urine samples were then subjected to a pretreatment followed by SPE on a 100 mg/6 mL Strata-X-Drug N tube as specifled in Table I. After extraction, the barbiturates were analyzed by LC-MS-MS using a Kinetex\u00ae 2.6 m C18 100 \u00d7 2.1 mm core-shell HPLC/UH- PLC column with the MS operating in APCI negative mode (Figure 1). Results and Discussion While developing an extraction method for the barbiturate spiked urine samples it was discovered that conditioning the Strata-X-Drug N SPE sorbent was not necessary as the elimination of this step did not aect recovery. By skipping this step we were able to save both solvent and time which could drastically improve the eciency of a high throughput lab. Te more ecient SPE extraction also provided high recoveries and excellent reproducibility which is noted in Table II. Downstream LC-MS-MS analysis on the Kinetex\u00ae core-shell HPLC/UHPLC column also provided signiflcant beneflts as we were able to successfully separate pentobarbital and amobarbital, which dier from each other by the placement of a methyl group which has histori-cally made it dicult to resolve the two compounds. It is thought that the separation on the Kinetex column was made possible by the high peak capacity and eciency of the Kinetex core-shell particle. Core-shell particles contain a 1.9 m solid core surrounded by a 0.35 m porous layer of silica. Tis allows the particle to perform like a sub-2 m col-umn in terms of resolution, eciency, and speed without the limiting backpressures that are associated with sub-2 m particles making it easy to adopt this technology without having to invest in a UHPLC system. Conclusion By pairing a streamlined SPE extraction with an ecient LC-MS-MS analysis, it is possible for any forensic lab to improve their barbiturate screening. Strata-X-Drug N SPE sorbent provided both time and solvent savings which are multiplied when screening numerous samples at once, making it faster and more profltable for forensic labs to screen barbiturate samples.

PHOTONIS resistive glass products are composed of a proprietary lead silicate glass that has been specially processed to create a resistive layer at the surface. The resistiv-ity can be varied over several orders of magnitude to suit the specic application. Resistive glass is manufactured by using a hydrogen ring pro-cess to create an integral semi-conductive layer on the sur- face. flis reduced lead silicate layer is typically several hundred angstroms thick. Resistive glass can be formed into plates, tubes, cylinders, sheets, washers, or other shapes. fle products are resis-tant to scratches from light to moderate abrasions, and can easily be cleaned ultrasonically with water, acetone, methanol, or IPA without degrading the performance. Application One application of resistive glass is capillary inlet tubes for at-mospheric pressure ionization sources. Single capillary inlet tubes made from resistive glass signicantly improve ion transfer eT-ciency when compared to conventional quartz inlet tubes. Volt-age applied across nickel-chromium electrodes at each end of the inlet tube creates an electric eld that preferentially attracts either positive or negative ions. Polarity switching can also be accom-plished more quickly than with conventional inlet tubes. fle properties of resistive glass help prevent ions from collid- ing with the tube walls and with each other, reducing ion loss and resulting in a more eTcient sample transfer by forcing more ions into the mass spectrometer. PHOTONIS has also developed a multicapillary resistive glass inlet tube. A proprietary multibore extrusion process creates a cir-cular array of six individual channels in the same footprint as a single capillary inlet tube (See Figure 1). Multicapillary resistive glass inlet tubes provide increased sen- sitivity by further improving ion transmission when compared to single capillary inlet tubes. T ubes made from resistive glass can also be used in other mass spectrometry applications, such as for drift tubes, collision cells, ion mirrors, voltage dividers, or reectron lenses. Another application of resistive glass is for use in ion mobility spectrometry drift tubes. Resistive glass drift tubes operate on the same principle as capillary inlet tubes, and demonstrate a similar improvement in ion transmission. fle solid tube body also pro-vides containment for counter-ow gas, eliminating the need for an additional enclosure. Results An increase in ion transfer eTciency by factor of 100 has been reported from using PHOTONIS single capillary inlet tubes. An increase in ion transmission of up to 10\u00d7 using multicap- illary tubes when compared to single capillary inlet tubes has been achieved by a leading mass spectrometer manufacturer, dramati-cally enhancing instrument sensitivity. Resistive glass multicapil-lary tubes therefore provide an increase in ion transfer eTciency of up to 1000\u00d7 when compared to conventional quartz tubes. A demonstrated improvement in ion transmission is also real- ized with the use of single-piece construction resistive glass IMS drift tubes when compared to traditional multipiece lens and ring assemblies. Resistive glass reectron tubes provided equal or better perfor- mance in an orthogonal TOF system. flis comparison showed superior resolution, indicating better energy focusing, while spec-tra between the two were nearly identical. Overall, resistive glass tubes oer benets to a variety of mass spectrometer applications, many of which can be realized by re-placing an existing tube with one made from resistive glass.

Selection of the appropriate ber is an important factor in achieving optimal system performance. Optical ber has been used for many years in chromatographic ap- plications which employ UV-Vis spectroscopy for sample detec- tion. Fiber has allowed advances such as remote sensing, where in the \"detection cell\" no longer has to reside inside the detector itself, with dissolution sampling probes being a prime example. Important factors to consider when selecting a ber are core size, -OH content, cladding thickness, potential bending radius, and optical attenuation. Of special interest is the phenomenon of UV solarization, which occurs when the ber absorbs high intensity radiation below 240 nm and bonds within the glass structure are broken. fle resulting \"color centers\" can exhibit strong absorbance which results in a marked increase in attenuation of the ber (1). Alternately, many researchers would prefer to describe this as a decrease in light transmission. Optical Fiber Attenuation in Deep UV flere are three key performance attributes to consider when compar-ing optical ber types for use in the deep UV: 1) fle initial attenua-tion of the ber prior to signicant exposure to UV radiation; 2) fle additional attenuation that appears with exposure to UV radiation (eventually saturating or stabilizing); and 3) fle stability of the atten-uation during periods of nonexposure (commonly called \"recovery\"). fle amount of recovery and redamage that takes place in repeated on/oT cycles is generally a small fraction of the original degradation. Fiber Types Available As most chromatographic analysis is done in the UV-Vis spectral range, designers typically use a high -OH ber. flere are four ber options: FVP is the traditional high -OH ber series and is excellent for applica - tions at or above 240 nm. Additional attenuation is signicant at lower wavelengths due to rapid solarization. FVP-UVM oers moderate solarization resistance below 240 nm. Even though it experiences solarization damage during initial exposure, ad-ditional attenuation is minimal providing stable performance thereafter. FVP-UVMI is a hydrogen loaded ber series. It provides out- standing solarization resistance to below 200 nm, but perfor-mance decreases dramatically once the hydrogen diTuses out of the ber. Lifetime is dependent upon hydrogen content and therefore both the ber diameter and operating temperature should be considered (2). flis ber type is thus limited to larger diameter ber (i.e., 400 m core or larger). Note that once the hydrogen diTuses out it behaves like FVP-UVM ber. FDP ber utilizes proprietary materials and processing steps, provid - ing excellent solarization resistance without the concerns related to hy-drogen diTusion. It has excellent lifetime and superior long term sta-bility with only minimal damage. It is the ber of choice for most deep UV applications, especially when smaller diameter ber is required. Fiber ComparisonFigure 1 contains a comparison of 214 nm transmission (relative to the initial) for various ber types when exposed to Deuterium lamp radiation. fle degradation can be seen, in most cases, to stabilize at a level beyond which no further damage occurs. Additional data on longer term expo-sure, and stability in on/oT cycles has also been collected. Conclusion flis note discusses solarization of optical ber and provides recommenda-tions for selecting the most appropriate ber type for UV-Vis applications. References (1) J. Zhou, J.

Shodex Asahipak NH2P series a polyvinyl alcohol based gel, modifled with polyamine. In this article, we compare the performance of a NH2P series col-umn and a silica-based amino HILIC column. Experimental Conditions A NH2P-50 4E column and a silica-based amino column, ob-tained from another company, were compared for their analytical performances. Mobile phase consisted of a mixture of acetonitrile and water. A conventional HPLC system was used with a Shodex RI detector. Results When acetonitrile concentration was increased, NH2P-50 4E provided stronger retention and a higher theoretical plate number for all saccharides and sugar-alcohols. In contrast, the silica-based amino column showed nonconsistent changes in the theoretical plate number and sensitivity to some saccharides. is was more obvious for galactose measurement that showed considerably low-er sensitivity with a silica-based amino column (Figure 1). In addition to saccharide separations, NH2P columns are suit- able for sugar-alcohol and saccharides separations. Separation of some sugar-alcohol and saccharide pairs (for example, sorbitol and glucose) is dicult by a silica-based HILIC column, whereas a NH2P column provides a base-line separation of those two. Another advantage of polymer-based NH2P columns is the inherent chemical stability, solving the deterioration problem over time that conventional silica-based columns have. One proof of high chemical tolerance is its wide pH working capa-bility (2-13). is allows a large selection of usable eluents in-cluding diTerent cleaning solvents. e performance tests under very extreme conditions (over 60 h of 0.1 N H 2SO4 and over 160 h of 0.005 N NaOH at pH 11.4) showed no consider-able deterioration of the column. us, it is also suitable for the method that requires an alkaline condition, such as separation of pyridylamino-derivatives. Moreover, very small \"bleeding\" of particles has been reported in NH2P series column. Consequently, this reduces the back-ground noise level. is is especially beneflcial when coupling the HPLC with a corona charged aerosol detection or an evaporative light scattering detector systems. Conclusions Advantages of polymer-based amino column, Shodex NH2P se-ries, over conventional silica-based amino are: ad-sorption of particular saccharides or sugar-alcohols, (ii) tolerances towards wide range of working conditions, and (iii) small bleed-ing. Using those advantages, the possible applications of NH2P series include analysis of carbohydrates in food stuT, and in bio-medical areas such as analysis of glycoproteins and glycolipids.

Bell, Supelco/Sigma-Aldrich Vitamin D deciency has become a topic of interest in recent publications (1-3). Vitamin D is present in two forms, Vitamin D3 and Vitamin D2. D3 is produced after ultraviolet light-stimulated conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin (3). Vitamin D2 is de- rived from plant sources. Both D2 and D3 are metabolized in the liver to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 (25-OH D2) and D2 and 25-OH D3 have been reported, especially in young children (3). fle levels of the 25-hydroxy metabolites are routinely measured for diagnostic assessment of vitamin D related diseases; however, recent studies have indicated that separation from the inactive 3-epi analogs may provide more accurate information for treatment and prevention. Analytical methods that can accurately quantitate both of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D analytes in the presence of 3-epi analogs may become essential for diagnosis and monitoring of patients with vitamin D disorders. LC-MS analysis of 25-OH D 2 and 25-OH D3 is classically per- formed using C18 stationary phases. Under such conditions, the 3-epi analogs are not resolved and thus are included in the overall reported value. Recently, Phinney and colleagues, reported the use of a cyano column for the eTective separation of the 25-OH and the 3-epi forms for use in reference measurement procedures (1). Although eTective, the conditions necessitate a run time of better than 40 min limiting its utility for routine high-throughput analyses. As an outcome of some recent application development eTorts, it was observed that Ascentis Express F5 stationary phase provided increased selectivity toward 25-OH D 3 and the corresponding 3-epi analog relative to reported methods. flis report provides a brief synopsis of continuing eTorts to assess the potential impact of this additional selectivity on routine clinical vitamin D diagnostics. Discussion fle initial conditions were adopted for fast LC-MS methodology. Figure 1 shows some preliminary results indicating that 25-OH D 3 and 3-epi-25-OH D3 can be rapidly resolved. 25-OH D2 and 3-epi- 25-OH D3 coelute under these high throughput conditions, how- ever they are easily resolved by mass response. fle methodology thus enables quantication of all three components in one analysis. Conclusions Separation of the biologically inactive 3-epi analog may serve to provide improved data in support of vitamin D related clinical di-agnostics and treatment. fle pentauorophenyl stationary phase has been shown to provide superior selectivity for the separation of the closely related 25-OH D 3 and 3-epi-25-OH D3 as com- pared to methods reported in the literature. Initial eTorts to show selectivity in a fast, LC-MS system provides promising evidence for implementation in real-world situations. References (1) S.S .-C. Tai, M. Bedner, and K.W.

S i n gl e t o n s ar e uni q u e , i n di vi d ual fi n al compounds synthesized for in-vitro testing. The main driver and objective behind this initiative was to save synthe-sis costs and time. Typically a majority of the singletons are made in 100-300 mg amounts. Datasets across various projects show that only ~20% of the singletons survive primary and second-ary screenings and hence ~80% of the compounds are made unnecessarily on the large scale. Pharmaceutical chem-ists can save considerable time and cost by making smaller (30-50 mg) batches. The chemists can submit synthesized compounds (30-50 mg) to ASAP to be purified, registered, and delivered to the materials management department as 30 mM dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solutions for biological screening. The workflow for compound synthesis to biological screening is shown in Figure 1. The turnaround time from samples received for purification to delivery to the materials management department is two to three business days. Centraliz-ing this activity in the purification group allows greater time for higher value tasks to be completed by practicing chemists; the purification scientists can provide expert-level service and technology, and also more opportunity for harmoniza-tion with screening (consistent and high quality samples delivered for biological assays). Experimental Following are the steps for sample sub-mission to ASAP: The samples submit-ted are final products (compounds going for biological screening \u2014 no intermedi-ates). The crude weight of the compound Aggregated singletons for automated purification (ASAP) is a purification workflow that provides singleton sample purification, registration, and delivery to the materials management department as 30 mM dimethyl sulfoxide solutions for biological screening. The singleton samples submitted are aggregated in a mini-array of 10-12 samples and then are analyzed using an automated purification process. The steps in the process include pre-quality control (QC), preparative chromatography, solvent evaporation, reformat dilution and duplication, final QC, and final registration. The turnaround time from samples received to delivery to materials management is two or three business days. The final QC data are uploaded to a database and are available to chemists via electronic laboratory notebook software. The final purity, weight recovery, and registration information is available in a research database and an e-mail notification of completion is sent to the chemist. ASAP enables a high purification success rate, increases the likelihood of running mini-arrays that generate 5-10 analogs in a final step rather than one or two with the same 2-3 day turnaround time, and provides expert-level service and technology.THE APPLICATION NOTEBOOK - JUNE 2011 59 is 10-50 mg. Some type of an initial sample workup (for example, liquid-liq-uid extraction, solid-phase extraction, and so forth) is highly recommended to remove metals or reagents used during the synthesis. The crude sample is fully dissolved in 900 \u00b5L of DMSO, filtered, and placed in a 2D bar-coded, matrix capped tube. The crude sample is then registered as an \"in-production single-ton\" sample via Chemistry e-Notebook electronic laboratory notebook software (CambridgeSoft, Cambridge, Massa-chusetts) using the software's Global Registration tool, which has been cus-t o mized f o r P fize r . Th e b i o l o gy assa y-screen panel is assigned and the sample is submitted for purification using Pfizer's Auto-Purification submission website. The sample is then dropped off in the assigned submission dry boxes in a Sin-gleton Matrix-Box container. The ASAP process is outlined in Fig- ure 2. A total of 10-12 singletons are aggregated in a plate format and associ-ated with a bar code using a 2D Matrix tube reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts). An analyti-cal plate of fixed concentration (1 mg/mL) is created using a Tecan Freedom Evo liquid handling system (M\u00e4n-nedorf, Switzerland). The samples in the analytical plate are then analyzed using reversed-phase liquid chroma-tography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and evaporative light scattering detec-tion techniques. The analytical system comprised a Waters 2795 Alli-ance high performance liquid chroma-tography (HPLC) system and ZQ mass spectrometer (Milford, Massachusetts) and a Polymer Labs 2100 ELSD sys-tem (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California). The initial purity of the sample can range from 5% to 80%. The pre-quality control (QC) gradient meth-ods are 5 min in length with 2-mL/min flow rates. Different column chemis-tries, modifiers, and gradient condi-tions are used to develop methods best suited for purification. Even though the samples are aggregated in a miniplate and analyzed in a high-throughput mode, a method is developed for each individual sample. The best method and conditions are then transferred to the preparative purification step.

Fraction col- lection is mass triggered. The prepara-tive methods are gradients run over 10 min. The collected fractions are evapo-rated using Genevac Mega evaporators (Gardiner, New York). The dry fraction tubes are then weighed on Tecan weigh-ing stations. The dried, purified material is dis- solved in DMSO to make 30 mM solu-tions. A maximum of 900 \u00b5L of the 30 mM DMSO solution is transferred to a plate. A daughter analytical plate is also created by transferring a 5-\u00b5L aliquot and adding enough DMSO to result i n a 0 . 5 - m g / m L c o n c e n t r a t i o n . E x c e s s 30 mM DMSO solution is transferred to bar-coded 2-mL vials. Tecan liquid handling systems are used for dispens-ing the DMSO and transfer of samples to the plates and vials. The samples in the vials are evaporated using a Genevac HT-12 evaporator in a two-step evapora-tion process. The final QC is performed using the HPLC-MS-ELSD system or Waters Acquity UPLC/SQD/PL 2100 ELSD units, and the samples are reg-istered if they meet the purity crite-ria (>80% purity by UV at 215 nm, >85 % purity by ELSD, and >50% mass spectral purity). Orthogonal QC m e t h o d s a r e s e l e c t e d t o e n s u r e t h e final purity of the samples. The solu-bilized plate (maximum up to 900 \u00b5L of 30 mM DMSO stock) is sent to the materials management department for assay preparations. The compound is then released for the requested screen-ing. The dry compounds are regis-tered and shipped to the Pfizer Neat Store. The pre-QC and final QC data are uploaded in Pfizer's Global Analytical database as a PDF and the file also gets linked to the chemist's e-Notebook submission page. The recovery amount, purity, and reg-istration data are available through Pfizer's Research database. An e-mail notification is sent to the chemists to inform them that the samples have been delivered to the materials man-agement department.

This information helps minimize the time required for method development. Results and Discussion T h e AS AP p r o c e s s w as i n t r o d u c e d i n Pfizer R&D (Groton) in April 2009. A major contributor to the success of ASAP is the strong partnership between the company's Analytical Chemistry and Medicinal Chemistry lines. A point o f c o n t a c t ( P O C ) w a s e s t a b l i s h e d f o r each project using ASAP to facilitate communication between the two lines. Training sessions were conducted for each project joining ASAP. There was a gradual ramp-up of projects added to ASAP to ensure continuous progress of implementation. Examples of Samples Purified by ASAP Figures 3 and 4 show pre-QC, prep, and final QC data for samples analyzed by ASAP. Figure 3 is an example of a sam-ple that was submitted to ASAP with an initial purity of ~15%. The target mass was isolated and enough material was delivered to the materials management department for screening. Figure 4 is an example of a complex sample. Under acidic conditions peak 4 in Figure 4a was coeluted with the target peak. However, after a method was developed in basic conditions, separation was obtained and the purified compound easily passed the final QC (Figure 4c).

The process provides a high success rate (>90% samples are registered). Postpurification analysis: The final purity is assessed by MS-UV-ELSD and QC data are uploaded into the Global Analytical database. Final purity information (purity and weight recovery) is available in the research database. An e-mail notification is sent to the chemist. Data can be accessed through electronic laboratory note-book software. The process increases the likelihood of running mini-arrays to generate 5-10 analogs in a final step rather than one or two, with the same 2-3 day turn-around time. The ASAP process allows projects to choose synthetic routes that diverge a t a l a t e s t a g e , w h i c h i s t h e m o s t effective way to prepare large sets of analogs. The ASAP process saves time and lets chemists focus on high-value activities such as making compounds for pre-liminary toxicity studies. Conclusions To date, more than 5700 singletons have been submitted and >90% of the samples have been successfully purified. ASAP is currently support-ing approximately 25 projects across different therapeutic areas. Although the samples are purified in an auto-mated purif ication mode, t he versatil-ity of the technology allows purifica-tion of diverse molecules with respect to compound solubility, polarity, and molecular weight. The next steps involve enhancing purification technologies such as adding normal-phase chromatography, supercriti-cal fluid chromatography, and on-column solvent exchange techniques to increase the scope of available chemical space.Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank David Price, Rose Gonzales, and Mark Noe for sponsoring ASAP and providing resources and staffing.

Green chemis-try, as defined by Anastas and Warner, is \"the use of a set of principles to elimi-nate the use or generation of hazardous substances...\" In other words, analytical chemistry and green chemistry funda-mentally are ways to think about the practice of chemistry. So, green analyti-cal chemistry is a convergence of these thought processes. Following an intro-duction to the 12 principles of green chemistry, an overview of green ana-lytical techniques, including sampling, separations, and spectroscopy, will be presented.

Patrick, Kevin Siek, Joe Binkley, Viatcheslav Artaev, and Michael MasonA New Path to High-Resolution HPLC-TOF- MS \u2014 Survey, Targeted, and Trace Analysis Applications of TOF-MS in the Analysis of Complex Biochemical Matrices High performance time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) is applied to the analysis and characterization of complex biological samples. High mass accuracy, high resolution, and accurate relative isotope abundance are all applied to the determination of analytes covering a range of concentrations in complex matrices including plasma and urine. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations are provided and include demonstrations of the impact of high-performance MS on sensitivity and selectivity. The ability to leverage high-performance MS in conjunction with a broad dynamic range in rapid ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analyses to identify unknowns and to propose putative metabolic biomarkers is demonstrated. The impact of speed of analysis and selectivity to the depth of coverage and accuracy of the analyses are discussed. Demands on modern ana- lytical chemistry are driven by enhanced information content, faster analyses, faster data processing, and higher throughput. Tools in separation science continue to increase the speed and information content of traditional analyses as dem-onstrated by the growing popularity of ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatog-raphy (UHPLC) (1), fast gas chroma-tography (GC) (2), and GC\u00d7GC (3). This creates demands for faster data acquisition and higher fidelity data, w h i c h i n m a s s s p e c t r o m e t r y ( M S ) translate to mass accuracy and resolu-tion. To address these demands, the mass resolution, mass accuracy, and data acquisition speeds of mass spec-trometry have been pushed to improve instrument capabilities. A historical overview of mass analyzers is provided in Table I with the representative per-formance attributes provided.The utility and value of high-res- olution, high mass accuracy MS has been emphasized in numerous recently reported applications of the technol-ogy (4-9). High-resolution MS has been the domain of Fourier-transform (FT) MS and magnetic-sector instru-ments for decades. The paradigm is shifting away from just high-reso-lution MS to high-performance MS that includes mass resolving power, mass accuracy, isotope abundance, and acquisition speed in its consid-erations. New developments in high-performance mass spectrometers have shown significant impact. Time-of-flight (TOF) instruments with higher resolution and enhanced performance are a significant portion of the efforts. Recent advances in TOF mass spec-trometers have enabled these instru-ments to provide high resolution and mass accuracy with speed, simplicity, and convenience. The measurement of THE APPLICATION NOTEBOOK - JUNE 2011 64 Figure 1: Depiction of multireflecting TOF or folded flight path design. Gridless Mirror Gridless Mirror Detector lon SourcePeriodic lon Lenses mass-to-charge ratio ( m/z) in a TOF analyzer is described by the following equation: t = D(m/2z)1/2 in which t is time, D is the flight distance, m is the mass, and z is the charge on the ion. This provides the fundamental relationship that t is pro-portional to D, and in turn, resolution (defined as [m/ m] or [t/2* t]) is also a function of D and t. This has been one of the challenges to TOF \u2014 to achieve long flight paths in reasonable physical space and provide high performance. A number of key advances have occurred over the past two decades that have improved the performance of TOF mass analyzers and have included orthogonal acceleration (10), high-speed electronics, delayed extraction (10), and pulsed ionization (11), which permit the most effective utilization of the flight path available. In spite of these advances, TOF mass analyz-ers are highly sensitive to the initial conditions of the ions as they enter the mass analyzer. This includes distribu-tions in velocity, time, and space dur-ing ion generation and at entry to the mass analyzer. To provide an extended flight path and address initial ion dis-persion, electrostatic time-focusing elements such as reflectrons (12) have been implemented, improving resolu-tion significantly. However, these approaches are lim- ited by dispersions and higher order aberrations, as well as flight lengths on the order of a few meters. Other efforts have attempted to extend the flight path using cyclotron and tor-roidal analyzers (13). Duty cycle and effective mass range are typical com-promises to high levels of mass mea-surement performance. With these advances, TOF has achieved a posi-tion in the realm of mass analyzers in which it provides sensitivity, mass accuracy and resolution that surpass some magnetic sector systems and encroach on the analyses historically reserved for FTMS systems. The prin-ciple advantage of a TOF system is the absence of scanning. This provides a mass measurement system well suited to analyte surveys rich in information content and high in duty cycle. These advances have opened the world of high resolution accurate mass analy-sis, historically the domain of FTMS a n d m a g n e t i c s e c t o r s , t o T O F m a s s analyzers with the added benefit of simplicity and speed. The signifi-cant advances of TOF mass analyzers toward high-performance mass spec-trometers continue in the approach discussed below. The New Technology In one of the most recent advances in TOF-MS, Verentchikov and col-leagues (14,15) have introduced the multireflecting time-of-flight ana-lyzer that uses a Folded Flight Path (FFP). This is depicted in Figure 1, which shows how the ions effectively pass between each of two planar ion mirrors and through an Einzel lens array. A major challenge in the multi-reflecting systems is poor transmission because of defocusing of ion trajectories. In the FFP configuration, transmission Table I: Overview of high-performance mass spectrometers Platform Resolving Power Mass Accuracy Acquisition Range sector >50,000 <100 ppb <10 and electrostatic traps)>106<10 ppb (trade-off with acquisition rate and magnet size)Trade-off with other attributes including resolving powerPoor (space charge)Limited by duration, eld strength, and experiment Time of flight (includes TOF and Q-TOF congu- rations)>104 (new systems approaching 105)1-5 ppm (lower values achievable with special consideration)Typically trade- off with resolving power Good (limited by dynamic range)Limited by pulse frequency and analyzer attributes THE APPLICATION NOTEBOOK - JUNE 2011 65 Ultrahigh Resolution High Resolution Nominal Resolution R rangeR = 50,000 m/z = 50-2500R = 2500 m/z = 50-2500A DA DA D Figure 2: The three modes of operation of the MRT/HRT system. The FFP design facilitates multiple flight distances for ions, and as such, the potential for multiple levels of resolving power. Ions pass between electrostatic mirrors and are refocused by central lenses for the length of the analyzer. Two full passes across the analyzer provide a 40-m flight path (ultrahigh resolution) and 100,000 resolving power, one pass through the entire analyzer provides a 20-m flight path (high resolution) and 50,000 resolving power, and a partial pass through the analyzer provides a 2-m path (nominal resolution) and 2500 resolving power.

The ions are constantly refocused as they traverse the flight path and cre-ate the extended flight path needed to enhance the resolution. The gridless design minimizes ion loss during the flight. The mass analyzer offers three effective flight paths of approximately 2-, 20-, and 40- m lengths with opera-tions in the same planar flight \"tube.\" These operational options are depicted in Figure 2. The number of passes or reflections determines the effec-tive pathlength, and by inference, the available resolving power. The perfor-mance capabilities of this system are provided in Table I.This design is applied to the analysis of analytes in complex matrices in the form of UHPLC coupled to atmospheric pressure ionization with TOF-MS. The matrices include plasma and urine, and the analytes include compounds of pharmaceutical interest and naturally occurring biological analytes associated with disease states. The applications discussed include the identification and relative quantitation of metabolites in plasma from three strains of Zucker rats, an example of the study of animal models of disease (16), and the analysis for metabolites of common cold medica-tions in human urine. Experimental The following represent the basic con-ditions used in the analyses described in the results and discussion which fol-low. Chromatographic separation was achieved using an Agilent Technolo-gies (Santa Clara, California) 1290 UHPLC system with mobile phases consisting of water with 0.1% (v/v) for-mic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) acid (B). Mobile phase was delivered at 0.1-0.2 mL/min and with gradients covering 0-80% B between 3 and 30 min. Injection volumes var-ied between 1 and 5 L. The column used was a 50 mm \u00d7 1 mm Hypersil Gold C18 AQ (Thermo Fisher Scien-tific, West Palm Beach, Florida).

Calibration was achieved using external calibration with Agilent Tune Mix. Rat plasma samples were obtained from Bioreclamation (Hicksville, New York) and were from lean, fatty, and obese Zucker animals. The plasma was from terminal bleeds with the rats being 7-9 weeks of age. The plasma samples were deproteinated using Microcon (Billerica, Massachusetts) cen trifugal d evi ces wi th a 5 K cu t o ff .

Urine was obtained from a healthy male volunteer before and after a sin-gle dose of cold medicine containing 6.5 mg doxylamine, 15 mg dextro-methorphan, and unspecified amounts of polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and other excipients. To remove salt and protein from each sample, a 0.15-mL aliquot was diluted with 1.05 mL methanol and centrifuged. A 1.0-mL aliquot of the clear supernatant was evaporated, reconstituted with 0.025 mL methanol and 0.10 mL water with 0.1% formic acid, and analyzed by UHPLC-TOF-MS under high resolution conditions. All other chemicals used were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Fairlawn, New Jersey) or Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri). Results and Discussion Rat Plasma Metabolomics: Plasma samples from lean (n = 10), fatty (n = 9) and obese (n = 10) Zucker rats were analyzed by LC-MS using high-performance TOF-MS. The analysis of the data was achieved by means of two mechanisms. In one, a list of established analytes was used to search the data for these analytes using an accurate mass targeted approach. In these instances, the exact m/z value was searched against the existing data to within 0.001 m/z unit. In the other, the accurate m/z values obtained from the analyses were used to deter-mine molecular formulas, and the formulas or the accurate m/z values were searched in ChemSpider (17) or KEGG (18) or other similar metabo-lite databases to facilitate the identi-fication of the analyte in question. In both of these instances, the ratio of area responses in the samples from the different phenotypes were then averaged and compared to each other for differences as three ratios. Spe-cifically, the Lean:Fatty, Lean:Obese, and Fatty:Obese response ratios were generated, and the averages for each phenotype are provided graphically in Figure 3 for representative analytes. The plot shows several selected or readily identified analytes that show positive changes in the Lean:Fatty and Lean:Obese ratios relative to the Fatty:Obese ratio. These include leu-cine/isoleucine, hippurate, dimethyl-arginine, kynurenine, and urate. The nearly sixfold change in leucine/iso-leucine is the most striking and largest proportional positive change for the \"fatty\" phenotype, while the change in kynurenine is the highest magni-tude change negatively correlated with the \"fatty\" state. Both kynurenine and leucine/isoleucine have been pre-viously associated with diabetes and obesity (19-23). At the beginning of this study, stan- dards were not available for confirma-tion of identity. As such, experiments including the fragmentation of \"pre-cursor\" ions before the mass analyzer (so-called in source CID) with accu-rate mass measurement of fragment ions and the use of relative isotope abundance were used to clarify or support identification. One analyte identified in these studies was butyryl carnitine. In this case, an ion at m/z = 232.1554 was observed to change in intensity between lean and fatty/obese states. The formula search for this m/z provided two formulas within 5 ppm of the target m/z: C 11H21N1O4 (0.77 ppm error) and C12H17N5 ( 1 . 3 p p m error). To provide additional informa-tion on the structures of the analyte, the fragment ions were extracted into a separate data channel and evalu-ated. Figure 4 shows an extracted ion chromatogram for both low (lean) and high (obese/fatty) samples along with the fragment ion spectrum from a lean sample. The two prominent fragment ions at m/z 1 7 3 . 08 2 an d 8 5 . 0 3 match the loss of trimethylamine from 232 and the loss of butyric acid group and a trimethylamino group from 232, respectively. These are consistent with the identification of 232.1554 as butyryl carnitine. To provide yet another piece of supporting evidence, the relative isotope abundance was generated for the two formula above and these were compared to what was observed in high (fatty/obese) and low (lean) intensity samples. These find-ings are provided in Table II. For the monoisotopic peak and first isotope the agreement with the theoretical dis-tribution is better than \u00b15% (relative) Table II: Mass accuracy in the assignment of identities to doxylamine metabolites Assignment Expected m/z - JUNE 2011 67 C11Percent theoreticalH21 C12H17N5NO4180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 12 C12 C0 1* 13 C 1* 13 C 2* 13 C 2* 13 C lsotope examined Figure 5: Comparison of relative isotope abundance measurements for the analyte at m/z 232.1554. The percent of the theoretical abundance is provided versus the expected values for each option and is shown as Option 1/Option 2. The options are the two highest hits in the formula match. Isotope abundance was calculated using the ChromaTOF-HRT tool. Signals were considered from each of five samples, which covered a range of response intensities, and all three 500000 0 6: Standard curve of butyryl carnitine from single injections: (a) 0.16-500 nM, (b) zoomed region of 0.16-20 nM. in all cases versus Option 1 (butyryl carnitine). For the second isotope (2 13C), the agreement is still better than \u00b117% (relative) for four of the five samples, with the fifth being of very low signal intensity. In all cases, the relative isotope abundance defines which of the two formula options best fits the data. This is most clearly seen in the first isotope data shown in Figure 5. This combination of accu-rate mass precursor analysis, accurate mass fragment ion analysis, and high integrity relative isotope evaluation is a clear demonstration of the impact that high-performance MS can have in metabolomic analysis and the charac-terization of analytes. Of additional importance in metab- olomic analysis is the dynamic range of the instrument. To effectively inter-rogate both abundant and trace level analytes simultaneously, the linear-ity of response across several orders of magnitude is necessary. To explore this an d th e limi t o f detecti o n o f th e accurate mass system, a standard curve of butyryl carnitine was created that covered the range of 0.16 through >500 nM. The plots of response versus concentration are shown in Figure 6 (Figure 6a: 0.16-500 nM; Figure 6b: 0.16-20 nM) and demonstrate that the dynamic range achievable here is clearly in excess of the 500 nM point shown (2500 nM not shown). This is equivalent to a linear dynamic range greater than 3000-fold (15,000-fold at 2500 nM). The experiment has its lowest detectable level at 0.16 nM or approximately 200 fg of butyrylcarni-tine on-column. This translates to the ability to examine either dramatic dif-ferences in concentrations of a single analyte or a range of analytes at sub-stantially different concentrations in the same analysis. Analysis and Characterization of Drug Metabolites in Urine: One of the most complex, but also most read-ily available, biological fluids is urine. It is difficult to standardize and is affected by diet, physiological state, disease, and other hard-to-control fac-tors (24). With all of this said, urine is still able to indicate the health of indi-viduals and to provide insights into what the body has been exposed to, as it does give up its metabolites easily through renal clearance mechanisms. Here, urine from a healthy donor was analyzed by UHPLC with high-per-formance detection. A minimal level of cleanup was performed with the o b j e c t i v e o f p r o v i d i n g a g l o b a l s u r -vey for metabolites of doxylamine and dextromethorphan. Figure 7 shows a representative set of chromatograms for actives and metabolites detected in urine. The extraction window of \u00b12 ppm shows the necessary stability of the mass accuracy across the entire peak. This facilitates accurate inte-gration of signal with high resolution and accuracy relative to other peaks. Although there are known compounds which should be present from the dos-ing, urine is a complex matrix, and as such, the identity of the analytes was confirmed by accurate mass analysis THE APPLICATION NOTEBOOK - JUNE 2011 68 Figure 7: (a) Base peak signal and extracted ion chromatograms of active ingredients and potential metabolites in urine. The signal for PEGs is clear between 50-100 s. (b) Precursor (low energy) and product (high energy) spectra from m/z 271 showing key fragment ions. The extraction window is \u00b12 150 175 200 225(a) (Table II), which showed less than 0.5 ppm mass errors for the proposed dox-ylamine-related peaks. Similar to what was achieved with the butyryl carni-tine peak, relative isotope abundance for the doxylamine provided highly accurate agreement with the theoreti-cal isotope abundance. This is shown in the top of Table III. In addition, the application of \"in-source CID\" to generate fragment ions provided b o t h a c c u r a t e m a s s f r a g m e n t i d e n t i -fication and accurate relative isotope abundance of the fragment ions. These findings are shown in the bottom of Table III. All but the lowest of signals provide better than 5% relative dif-ference versus the theoretical isotope abundance. Furthermore, the mea-sured resolving power was in excess of 40,000 at m/z 271, and even at m/z 90, the resolving power was a robust 35,000. Conclusions The above applications of high-per-formance MS to the analysis of physi-ological analytes and metabolites in complex biological matrices provide a representative overview of the impact that this type of experimentation can have on analyte identification and quantitation. High mass accuracy, mass resolving power, and relative isotope abundance prove to be invalu-able tools for analyte identification in the experiments discussed and facili-tated the identification of analytes as potential biomarkers for obesity and as metabolic byproducts of pharmaceuti-cal agents. Having high mass accuracy, resolving power, and isotope measures available in both precursor and frag-ment ions make the confidence an analyst might have in the identifica-tion of analytes extremely high. As this can be achieved on femtogram amounts of material using high acqui-sition rates with analysis times of a few minutes and provide high performance under all acquisition conditions, high-performance MS is both fast and of high information content. These findings clearly define the ability of high-performance MS to provide a positive impact in the advancement of metabolomic and metabanomic analyses.

Besides well-known diseases like rickets and osteomalacia, vitamin D deficiency has been linked to cancer and heart disease and is rapidly becoming the most widely used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based clinical test. Increases in testing frequency have required more rapid and cost-effective solutions for determining vitamin D levels in plasma. An LC-MS method for vitamin D 2/D3 was adapted for use with core-shell columns to achieve run times of less than 4 min. This method provides rapid, sensitive, rugged, and robust LC-MS-MS analysis of vitamin D levels in patient serum (LOD of 1 and 2 ng/mL for 25-OH D 3 and 25-OH D2, respectively, with CV of 4-7%) and speeds the diagnosis by hospital and clinical laboratories of potential vitamin D deficiencies. Vi t a m i n D i s r e c o g n i z e d a s a n essential nutrient with its pri-mary physiological function being to increase intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and to pro-mote deposition of these minerals in newly formed bones. Deficiency and abnormal vitamin D levels result in impaired bone mineralization and lead to bone softening diseases \u2014 rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. In addition, a large number of bone dis-orders and mineral metabolism defects have been associated with abnormal vitamin D levels, including nephritic syndrome, granulomatous diseases, and hypocalcemia, as well as secondary hyperparathyroidism, which frequently complicates renal failure. Additional well-known maladies, including car-diovascular disease, cancer, and auto-immune disorders, recently have been found to be influenced by vitamin D deficiencies; as a result, vitamin D test-ing has increased tremendously across a variety of patient groups (1,2). Vitamin D is metabolized to 25-OH D in the liver. Total vitamin D is best deter-mined by measuring total 25-hydroxyvi-tamin D (D 2 and D3) in serum because the half-life of 25-OH D is about three weeks with serum concentrations of 10-50 ng/mL. Vitamin D supplementa-tion in both food and tablets comes in both the D 2 an d D3 f o r m s , m aki n g i t imperative to measure 25-OH D2 and 25-OH D3. Although optimal serum concentrations of total 25-OH D are generally agreed to be 30 ng/mL, there is considerable discussion on the serum concentration of 25-OH D considered t o b e i n a d e q u a t e f o r b o n e a n d o v e r -all health, but <20 ng/mL is generally regarded as deficient. Serum concentra-tions >100 ng/mL are generally regarded as potentially toxic (3). Vitamin D exhibits a high propensity for inherent endogenous serum protein THE APPLICATION NOTEBOOK - JUNE 2011 71 binding and association. Vitamin D is typically not found free in serum sam-ples, thereby posing a challenge for sensi-tive and reproducible high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis without appropriate sample prepara-tion. Additionally, various serum sample matrix constituents are found to cause ion suppression that reduces accuracy and reproducibility during patient sam-ple analysis. This ion suppression can be especially troublesome with rapid LC-mass spectrometry (MS) methods where insufficient resolution can be observed between matrix contaminants and ana-lyte peaks. A recent innovation in HPLC column technology has been the introduction of core-shell silica particles. Unlike fully porous silica media, core-shell media employ structured particle geometry where a thin porous shell is grafted on a nonporous core particle. This particle geometry has a reduced analyte diffu-sion distance along with a tight particle size distribution that results in column efficiency on par with or better than sub- 2-\u00b5m media while maintaining column back pressures more in line with tra-ditional HPLC columns. Higher per-formance at lower back pressure using core-shell HPLC columns offers the promise of improving existing HPLC methods without having to replace existing HPLC instrumentation with ultrahigh-pressure-compatible LC sys-tems. This article discusses an example of using core-shell columns to improve the resolution of a separation while reducing analysis run time. Experimental Reagents and Chemicals25-Hydroxyvitamin D 3 a nd 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-d6 were obtained from Medical Isotopes (Pelham, New Hampshire) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D 2 was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri). HPLC-grade water (Milli-Q, Millipore, Billerica, Mas-sachusetts) was used to prepare HPLC mobile phase and for sample prepara-tion. Methanol and acetonitrile were obtained from Honeywell, Burdick & Jackson (Muskegon, Michigan). Stock internal standard solution was prepared by dissolving the contents of a 5-mg vial of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3-d6 in 5.0 mL of ethanol. The precipitation reagent was prepared by adding 10 \u00b5L of inter-nal standard stock solution to 60 mL of (v/v) acetonitrile-methanol in a with 95:5 acetonitrile-meth-anol. To analyze patient samples, 350 \u00b5L of precipitating reagent containing internal standard was combined with 100 \u00b5L of serum and vortexed for 30 s. After inspecting the tube to ensure that the sample was fully mixed, the sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Supernatant was transferred to an HPLC vial and 40 \u00b5L was injected onto an LC-MS-MS system. LC-MS-MS was performed using an HPLC system equipped with binary pump, autosampler, and column oven interfaced with an Applied Biosystems 4000 Qtrap mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Foster City, California) with a Turbo V ion source or with an Applied Biosystems API 4000 triple-quad-rupole mass spectrometer. An atmo-spheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source was used and was run in positive ion mode. The MS-MS operat-ing conditions are listed in Table I. The HPLC column used for all analyses was a 50 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 2.6-\u00b5m core-shell Kinetex C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, California) operating at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. This method was compared against a methodology using a fully porous 5-\u00b5m C18 column. A gradient method was employed using an aqueous mobile phase A of 0.05% formic acid in water and an organic mobile phase B of 0.1% formic acid in methanol with 5 mM ammonium ace-tate. The gradient was as follows: hold at 8% B for 5 s, then 8-100% B in 200 s (3.33 min). The column was washed and re-equilibrated between injections and maintained at 35 \u00b0C. Results and Discussion Analysis of 25-OH D2 and 25-OH D3 from serum necessitates the use of sam-ple preparation procedures to remove potential matrix constituents, which will interfere with accurate and precise determination of 25-OH D in serum and reduce HPLC column life. Vita-min D and the hydroxy D metabolites are relatively more hydrophobic than virtually all endogenous and exog-enous compounds that are typically quantified in biological matrices. The propensity for vitamin D to inherently associate with serum proteins reduces the bioavailability of free vitamin D in serum; therefore, it is necessary to dis-rupt this association for improved assay accuracy and precision. Protein precip-itation is the easiest means of disrupt-ing the serum protein association with hydrophobic analytes. In this method, protein precipitation is performed in 1.5-mL centrifuge tubes with the addi-tion of 100 \u00b5L of serum sample to solubility of the endog-enous proteins in acetonitrile results in their precipitation from the sample; mixing and centrifugation cause the precipitated protein to form a pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube, and the supernatant is then analyzed. An alternative to the traditional protein precipitation approach involves the use of a protein precipitation plate, such Table I: MS-MS operating conditions Instrument API 4000 w/TurboV APCI APCI Scan cas (CUR) 10.00 15.00 Nebulizer current 5.00 5.00 Temperature (TEM) High Entrance potential (EP) 10.00 3.30 Interface heater (ihe) ON ONTHE APPLICATION NOTEBOOK - JUNE 2011 72 as Strata Impact (Phenomenex), which contains an oleophobic membrane fil-ter. Following addition of acetonitrile to the serum sample to facilitate pro-tein precipitation, the sample passes through a 0.2-\u00b5m cut-off filter of the precipitation plate to eliminate the pre-cipitated protein from the sample. LC-MS was performed in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode (see Tables II and III for the MRM tran-sitions monitored using the API 4000 and QTRAP MS systems, respectively). The use of MRM is important because 25-OH D 2 a n d 2 5 - O H D3 a r e n o t separated chromatographically; how-ever, the unique parent-daughter ion combination for each analyte allows for specificity and accurate determination of the concentration for each analyte in the sample. 25-OH D 3-d6 was used as an internal standard and signal inten-sity of each 25-OH D analyte rela-tive to the internal standard was used for determining the concentration of 25-OH D 2 and 25-OH D3 in the sam- ple. The calibration curves were lin-ear over the range from 0 to >500 ng/mL, with observed limits of detection (LOD) of 1 and 2 ng/mL for 25-OH D 3 an d 2 5-O H D2, respectively. The reproducibility of this assay was very good with CV of 4-7%. Both the HPLC and UHPLC condi- tions using a 50 mm \u00d7 2.0 mm, 5-\u00b5m fully porous C18 column and the 2.6-\u00b5m core-shell column, respectively, allow for sufficient retention of 25-OH D 2 and 25-OH D3, further minimizing the potential for interference and ion-suppression from any weakly retained impurities (Figures 1 and 2). Using the 5-\u00b5m C18 column, elution of 25-OH D 2 a n d 2 5 - O H D3 o c c u r r e d i n j u s t under 5 min, with an overall chromato-graphic run time of 8 min, including column re-equilibration. The separa-tion using the 2.6-\u00b5m core-shell C18 D 2 and 25-OH D3 are eluted in less than 4 min. This allows the overall chromato-graphic run time, including column re-equilibration, to be reduced to 6 min. The shorter analysis time using the core-shell column is a significant benefit for laboratories analyzing a large num-ber of samples in a high-throughput sample environment \u2014 the reduction in overall chromatographic run time translates into a 25% increase in sample throughput and corresponding reduc-tion in solvent usage. In addition to the faster chromatographic separation, the peak intensities are significantly larger Table II: API 4000 triple-quadrupole MS 03.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.9 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4Intensity (cps) 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.9 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4Intensity (cps) 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.9 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4Time (min) Time (min) Time (min) 6.0e4Intensity 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 Time (min) Time (min) Time (min)3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6Figure 1: LC-MS-MS analysis of 25-OH D2 and D3 standards run on a fully porous 5-\u00b5m C18 column.

T h e m o s t i m p o r t a n t b e n e f i t i s t h e improved efficiency and resolution pro-vided by the core-shell column. With the fully porous 5 \u00b5m C18 column, an endogenous compound (D 3 cholesterol) present in patient samples was found to be coeluted with the 25-OH D 3 peak, impacting accurate quantitation and increasing the need to reanalyze a large percentage of patient samples (Figure 3). The presence of the endogenous com-pound in patient samples was resolved from 25-OH D 3 a n d w a s e l u t e d o u t - side the quantitation window on the core-shell column (Figure 4), resulting in increased analytical accuracy. This improvement in throughput and resolu-tion was achieved at system back pres-sures compatible with standard HPLC systems (400-bar back-pressure limit). Conclusions The analytical method presented above allows for the rapid and accurate deter-mination of vitamin D levels in patient serum samples and speeds the diagnosis of potential vitamin D deficiencies indic-ative of specific disease states quickly and with a high degree of precision. Protein precipitation is used for sample prepara-tion of patient serum samples, effectively disrupting the serum protein association with 25-OH D 2 a n d 2 5 - O H D3 and providing sufficient sample cleanup before LC-MS-MS analysis. Protein precipitation plates would be an effec-tive alternative for sample preparation in a high-throughput clinical laboratory environment. The core-shell column allows for faster chromatographic analysis of patient samples and increased signal intensity for improved sensitivity. The increase in chromatographic resolution from an endogenous compound present in patient serum samples provides improved accu-racy and reproducibility and a decrease in sample reanalysis. This clinical example shows the advantages of using core-shell columns with existing HPLC instru-mentation to realize an improvement in throughput and performance. Other UHPLC columns require ultrahigh-pressure instrumentation, which can be a difficult (and unnecessary) choice in the current economic climate.
