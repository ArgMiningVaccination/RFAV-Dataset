Students will briefly meet with their advisor at this time to answer any questions about policies/procedures in the program. Students will arrange meetings with their faculty advisor a minimum of one advising session per semester, approximately the midpoint in the semester. During these meetings, the student and the faculty advisor will review the following inf ormation: The Evaluation of Student Learning Outcomes for each course during the current semester, the Clinician Evaluation form for each clinical completed to date, as well as the student's portfolio completed to date. Additionally, the student will complete a generic skills form each semester for their first year in the program. Faculty are required to be available to students through appointments, phone calls, emails and office hours (See Faculty Office Hours Policy). During the orientation, the students will be informed about the policies and procedures with respect to academic and clinical instruction. This infor mation will also be available to students in the Program Handbook, syllabi and on the program website (https://healthprofessions.stonybrookmedicine.edu/progr ams/speech -language -pathology ). At the first advisement meeting, the faculty member will assess the student's language proficiency in English (see Student Proficiency in English form). If it is determined that a student does not demonstrate English profi ciency appropriate for clinical practice, the student will be counseled about the appropriate recommendations. The faculty advisor will review and complete the Tracking form, as well as, the Course Plan of Study during advisement sessions each semester. The faculty member will maintain minutes of their advisement meetings in the student's file. The chair will follow -up periodically with faculty, through email and impromptu meetings, to ensure that appropriate communication and counseling occurs with studen ts with whom there are concerns about their performance. 2.7 Clinical Advisement Students will meet with the Director of Clinical Education once a semester (at the end of the semester) to review the clinical requirements toward graduation. Prior to meeting w ith the Director of Clinical Education, students will complete the clinical evaluation form, and the Clinical Requirements for the program form. When meeting with the director of clinical education, students will discuss progress towards graduation about c linical hours and experiences, as well as, review their midterm and final performance evaluations. The program uses CALIPSO to record and maintain all the students' clinical program requirements. Students are also expected to read and review the School of Health Professions Student Responsibilities for Clinical Education Handbook. Students are expected to have updated immunizations, health clearance, CPR training, and liability insurance. 2.8 Supervision and Placements The policies and procedures that describe how the manner and amount of supervision are determined and are adjusted to reflect the competence of each student and that will allow each student to acquire the independence to enter independent professional practice. A minimum of 25% of the clinical practicum session will be supervised. Supervisi on will be adjusted depending on the competence and experiences of the student. As students advance in the graduate program it is expected that less supervision will be required as they acquire the skills for independent practice. Clarification on type of hours and counting hours can be found by clicking the following link - https://www.asha.org/certification/covid -19-guidance -from -cfcc/ Also, information about student requirement for graduation can be found by clicking the following link - https://www.asha.org/certification/2020 -slp-certification -standards/ Supervisors are responsible to perform the tasks of supervision as outlined in the following link - https://www. asha.org/policy/ps1985 -00220/. Before serving as a supervisor or CF mentor for purposes of ASHA certification, individuals must hold ASHA certification (CCC -A or CCC -SLP), 20 have completed a minimum of nine months of practice experience post -certification, and have earned at least two hours of professional development post-certification (one -time requirement) in the area of supervision and/or clinical instruction. Standard V -E Supervision of students must be provided by a clinical educator who holds ASHA certification in the appropriate profession and who, after earning the CCC -A or CCC -SLP, has completed (1) a minimum of 9 months of full -time clinical experience, an d (2) a minimum of 2 hours of professional development in clinical instruction/supervision. https://www.asha.org/certification/2020 -slp-certification -standards/ The Depar tment requires a copy of their ASHA card, NYS license, TSHH/TSSLD if applicable, resume /biosketch and supervisory and ethics course information. Each supervisor will have an account in CALIPSO to add the midterm and final performance evaluation for the student and approve thei r clinical clock hours. The following link provides information about Frequently asked questions for supervision - https://www.asha.org/slp/supervisionfaqs/ . Some factors which are important in determining clinical placements include placements available to supervise students during the semester, students' prior placements, didactic and clinical performance, professional behaviors, knowledge and skil ls necessary, student growth and goals. Students are required to interview for placements and some placements may be competitive. It is the responsibility of the student to prepare for their interview and seek out available resources. Students are expected to obtain their own transportation to and from placements. A placement may be approximately 60 - 90 minutes away with traffic on Long Island . See Supervisory Handbook. 2.9 CALIPSO and Maintaining Clock Hours The Stony Brook University Program uses CALIPSO, a web -based secure platform system, to track students' clinical clock hours, clinical evaluations, and program outcomes. Students will be provided with a pin to register as users on CALIPSO during their firs t semester of coursework. The site can be accessed at: https://www.CALIPSOclient.com . Students will need to maintain accurate records of earned clock hours. Students can earn clock hours with a class assignment which is supervised and approved by a licensed and certified speech -language pathologist. ASHA requires that all candidacy programs be able to show evidence that their graduating students possess the knowledge and skills in various areas relating to prevention, assessment and treatment of communication disorders. The Knowledge and Skills Form is found in CALIPSO. Students will need to maintain accurate records of earned clock hours. Students must add observation and/or clinical clock hours within CALIPSO daily, however, the superv isor is expected to approve all hours every two weeks in CALIPSO. Students will not be permitted to add hours after the placement is completed and the semester grade has been entered. It is the responsibility of the student to be accountable/ aspects of professional practice for their hours. Hours added after the semester ends will not be approved. Students can earn clinical clock hours with a class assignment which is supervised and approved by a licensed and certified speech - language pathologist. ASHA requires tha t all candidacy programs be able to show evidence that their graduating students possess the knowledge and skills in various areas relating to prevention, assessment and treatment of communication disorders. The Knowledge and Skills Form is found in CALIPS O. 2.10 Clinical Curriculum and Sequencing Procedures are in place to ensure that written agreements between th e external site and the program are signed before students are placed. The program's practices in this regard will be consistent with existing policies and procedures of other programs in the School of Health Professions. The Director of Clinical Education will be required to provide the Chair with a portfolio of the external site prior to the student's placements. Contained within that portfolio will be a checklist of items required for that site as well items the program requires. One of the items that wi ll be required by the program is a signed copy of the written agreement between the external site and the program. The SHTM has a contracts coordinator who is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and maintenance of such agreements. 21 The Director of Clinica l Education and the Chair of the program are responsible for conducting site visits and meeting with prospective supervisors. The Director of Clinical Education will be responsible for communicating the responsibilities of the supervisor and the student fo r the clinical. The Director of Clinical Education will be responsible for placing students at externship sites and providing a supervisor handbook and guidelines. The supervisor will be encouraged to maintain an open line of communication with the Directo r of Clinical Education each semester. The student will meet with the Director of Clinical Education each semester to discuss their previous experiences, needs and preferences, as well as, their previous placement. The Director of Clinical Education will d ecide the student's placement based on the student's experiences, clinical hours required, clinical population needed and location preferences. Students will engage in clinical practice experiences each semester throughout their two -year program. The Direc tor of Clinical Education is responsible for coordinating placements and supervising students during Clinical I and Clinical II. Students are supervised by faculty with their respective expertise during Clinical I and/or Clinical II. During HHS 581: Clinic al I, students will integrate information learned in current speech -language pathology courses through real -life clinical experiences, classroom discussions and interprofessional clinical simulations with other allied health professionals (other allied hea lth professionals inside and outside of SHTM) including but not limited to respiratory therapists, physician assistants, nurses, physicians, and dentists. Clinical clock hours will be obtained for real -life experiences and clinical simulations. Simu -case will also be used in Clinical I. During HHS 582: Clinical II, students will integrate information learned in previous and current speech - language pathology courses through real-life clinical experiences and classroom discussions. Students will provide prev ention, and evidence -based practice assessment and intervention services with children or adults. Clinical clock hours will be obtained for real -life experiences at the Long Island State Veterans Home and Southampton Hospital. During HHS 583: Clinical III, students will integrate information learned in previous and current speech - language pathology courses through real -life clinical experiences and classroom discussions. Students will provide prevention, and evidence -based practice assessment and intervent ion services with children or adults. Clinical clock hours will be obtained for real-life experiences at an outside placement. During HHS 584: Clinical IV, students will integrate information learned in previous and current speech - language pathology cours es through real-life clinical experiences and classroom discussions. Students will provide prevention, and evidence -based practice assessment and intervention services with children or adults. Clinical clock hours will be obtained for real-life experience s at an outside placement. During HHS 585: Clinical V, students will integrate information learned in previous and current speech - language pathology courses through real-life clinical experiences and classroom discussions. Students will provide prevention , and evidence -based practice assessment and intervention services with children or adults. Clinical clock hours will be obtained for real -life experiences at an outside placement. This course is a required clinical for students not completing the TSSLD or TSSLD with Bilingual Extension. If a student chooses to obtain their TSSLD certification, the student must enroll in Speech and Language Pathology in the Schools Clinical instead of Clinical V. This is a required clinical/seminar for students pursuing the ir TSSLD certification. Students will complete 150 clock hours of supervised clinical practice in a school setting. There will be a seminar which will meet once weekly and allow students to discuss evidence -based practice assessment and intervention in the school setting, models of service delivery, multicultural diversity, advocacy and outreach, classroom management, NYS Standards, educating family, collaboration with professionals, and reflect about their clinical experiences. If a student chooses to obta in their bilingual extension, the student must enroll in Speech and Language Pathology in 22 the Schools Bilingual Clinical which is a required clinical/seminar for students pursuing their Bilingual Extension certification. Students are required to complete 2 00 clock hours (50 hours with bilingual population) of supervised clinical practice in a bilingual school setting. There will be a seminar which will meet once weekly and allow students to discuss evidence -based practice assessment and intervention in the school setting, models of service delivery, multicultural diversity, advocacy and outreach, classroom management, NYS Standards, educating family, collaboration with professionals, and reflect about their clinical experiences. Students will enroll in Clini cal Concepts in Audiology and Audiology Clinical simultaneously in the summer semester. The course will provide the student with the knowledge and skills necessary to perform the responsibilities as outlined in the scope of practice of the speech -language pathologist while the clinical will provide the student with the practical skills necessary to perform the responsibilities as outlined in the scope of practice of the speech -language pathologist. Additionally, students will enroll in the Diagnostics in Sp eech-Language Pathology course and clinical simultaneously. This course will cover the principles and methods of evidence -based practice assessment of a variety of communication and swallowing disorders across the lifespan. Whereas, the clinical will provi de the students with hands -on experience in providing evidence -based practice assessment with children and adults diagnosed with communication and swallowing disorders. Students will maintain a record of their clinical hours within CALIPSO, as well as, the ir midterm and final clinical evaluations. 23 Chapter 3 - Assessment 3.1 Assessment of Student Learning The development of student learning outcomes will be an on -going process guided by the mission of the university, school and program and scheduled discussio ns among the program faculty, external supervisors, program advisory committee, and students and in consultation with Dean of the SHP at Stony Brook University. The Program Chair and program faculty will be responsible for continually ensuring that the st udent learning outcomes also meet the knowledge and skills delineated in the CCC -SLP standards. The validation of the student learning outcomes is the responsibility of the Program Chair, program faculty, external supervisors, and students. The process of validating student learning outcomes for the knowledge and skills required for entry into professional practice will consist of a variety of formative and summative assessments such as: course exams, student self -evaluation of student learning outcomes; in structor evaluation of student learning outcomes; semester meetings with advisor to track progress towards completion of CFCC requirements and graduation requirements; mid -term and end of semester clinic evaluations, pass rate on the Praxis examination in SLP; student program clinical portfolios; and solicited feedback from employers, advisory committee, external supervisors, and alumni; as well as professional involvement and expertise of the program faculty and ensuing discussions at faculty meetings and at the annual retreat. The student will be expected to meet the knowledge and skills competencies for each course. The instructor for the course will provide the student with the knowledge and skills outcomes for the course. The student will review the knowledge and skill areas at the midterm and final examination timeframes. If the student does not meet the knowledge and skills in an assignment/course, the student is expected to complete an \"remediation\" assignment. This assignment is designed in collabor ation with the instructor. After the student achieves the knowledge and skills necessary for the assignment/course, the grade does not change. The program will use a variety of mechanisms to provide and document regular feedback to students regarding thei r progress in achieving the expected knowledge and skills in all academic and clinical components of the program. For the academic program: Instructors will provide students with formative mid -semester evaluations of student learning outcomes as part of each course and within each clinic experience (HHS 581: Clinical I, HHS 582: Clinical II, HHS 583: Clinical III, HHS 584: Clinical IV and HHS 585: Clinical V, Clinical in the Schools). In addition, students will have end of the semester meetings with their assigned advisor. During these meetings, the student and advisor will review the following forms: Evaluation of Student Learning Outcomes for each course; Student Self -Evaluation of Student Learning Outcomes for each course, Student Clinician Evaluation f orm completed by each supervisor, and Clinical Self -Evaluation form completed by the student, as well as the student's program portfolio. Student learning outcomes and the clinical evaluations forms will be aligned with the knowledge and skills delineated in the KASA. During the review of the aforementioned forms, the student and advisor will discuss and document the student's current knowledge and skills on the KASA. The KASA will then be updated and signed and dated by the advisor and the student. Durin g this meeting the advisor and student will also update the student's Planned Course of Study form which includes ASHA CCC requirements, program degree requirements, state licensure requirements, state teacher certification requirements, and/or other progr am certifications. At this time the Planned Course of Study form is also updated and signed and dated by the advisor and student, as well as the Semester Clock Hour form. The original of these forms will be placed in the student's file and the student wil l be provided with a copy of 24 the forms to retain in their program portfolio. Other mechanisms that will be used to provide and document regular feedback to students regarding their progress in achieving the expected knowledge and skills in the clinical c omponents of the program include: o weekly meetings with their clinic supervisors; o written feedback following clinic sessions or portions of clinic sessions that the clinic supervisor observed, mid-term and end of the semester meetings where the clinic supervisor and student review the Clinical Self -Evaluation form completed by the student clinician in conjunction with Student Clinician Evaluation form completed by the supervisor. 3.2 Policies for Intervention and Remediation and Probation Students are expected to complete their KASA form after the completion of each course where they met the learning outcomes. The instructor will complete Evaluation of Student Learning Outcomes Form and return it to the student. If the student requires a Remediation plan, the Remediation fo rm will be used. Students wil l be placed on Probation for demonstrating any violation of the ASHA Code of Ethics or unprofessional behaviors in the program, as well as obtaining one C+ or lower in a didactic course or a B- or lower in a clinical course. Students will be removed from probation after a full semester of grades higher than B- in didactic courses and B in clinical courses. 3.3 Academic aspects of the program: A student will be expected to successfully attain all the knowledge and skills/competencies for each of the didactic and clinical courses. Students must earn a grade of \"B - \"or higher in all didactic course s and demonstrate mastery of the required knowledge and skills for that subject area. If students earn a C+ grade in any course or does not master the required knowledge and skills for that subject area, they must complete an assignment to acquire the know ledge and skills which they did not achieve in the course. The faculty instructor in collaboration with the chair of the program and the student will develop a remediation plan for the student to achieve the knowledge and skills. If a student earns two gra des of C+ or lower in didactic courses, they will be dismissed from the program. If a student receives a grade of B - or higher but does not demonstrate mastery of all the Knowledge and Skills, the faculty instructor in collaboration with the chair of the p rogram and the student will develop a remediation plan for the student to achieve the knowledge and skills. 3.4 Clinical aspects of the program: A student will be expected to successfully attain all the knowledge and skills/competencies for each of the clinica l courses. Students must earn a grade of \"B \"or higher in all clinical course and demonstrate mastery of the required knowledge and skills for that subject area. If students earn a B - grade or lower in any clinical or does not master the required knowledge and skills for that subject area, they must complete an assignment to acquire the knowledge and skills which they did not achieve in the clinical. The Director of Clinical Education and the clinical supervisor in collaboration with the Chair of the progra m and the student will develop a Remediation plan for the student to achieve the knowledge and skills. If a student earns two grades of B - or lower in clinical courses, they will be dismissed from the program. If a student receives a grade of B or higher b ut does not demonstrate mastery of all the Knowledge and Skills, the clinical supervisor in collaboration with the director of clinical education and the program chair will develop a remediation plan for the student to achieve the knowledge and skills. The faculty instructor will ensure that the remediation plan designed will be implemented, documented and provided to students. After the student completes the remediation plan and achieves the desired competencies, the faculty advisor documents this within t he student's file. The chair will ensure that these policies and procedures will be applied consistently across all students who are identified as needing intervention. All remediation plans will be submitted to the chair who will review and sign off on th e plans once the faculty instructor has approved it. All the faculty will review the plans yearly during the faculty retreat to ensure that the plans are consistent in rigor and 25 expectations. 3.5 Summative Assessments of the Program The program will use midt erm and final course evaluation, evaluations from clinical sites, supervisor evaluations, student program completion rates in the three tracks, PRAXIS scores, and employment rates, and exit and alumni surveys to evaluate program quality. The chair will dis cuss instructors' syllabi, midterm and final course evaluations with them to determine what possible changes are necessary to ensure that course content is of appropriate quality, currency and effectiveness. The program will evaluate the currency and effec tiveness of all aspects of the program in faculty meetings, annual retreat and meetings with advisory committee. The chair and the faculty will review the student graduate rates, PRAXIS scores, and employment rates at program meetings and the annual retrea t to determine if any modifications are necessary in the program. The program will engage in a systematic self -study at an annual faculty retreat. The faculty and chair will review the mission and goals of the program, curriculum, formative and summative a ssessment measures, and program outcome data to note if any modifications in the program are required. Students are required to complete three summative measures prior to being eligible for graduation: 1. A Capstone Research Project which is the summative m easure for the program. Students are required to complete a project in the second year of their graduate program. This course will provide the students the necessary tools to prepare and present a professional poster illustrating their research study. Stud ents will write a research paper summarizing their capstone project for submission to a journal or for a professional presentation. A year-long Capstone Research Project is one of the summative measures for the Stony Brook University Graduate program in Speech Language Pathology . Students begin their capstone experience when they enroll in HHS 551 Research Methods and Resources in Communication Sciences and Disorders during the spring of their first year. Students conclude their Capstone experience in HHS 594 Capstone Project in Speech Language Pathology and Pr axis Examination Preparation in the spring of their second year. During HHS 551, students are expected to complete the following : Students will complete an on -line Human Subjects training in the course. Link to be provided. Students will create a group of 5 students who they will work with to develop and complete the research project. A research mentor will be assigned to each student group by the summer . A meeting will be scheduled with the mentor where the group of students will propose ( five students ) potential topics for research project. Students will arrange a schedule to meet with their mentor during the semester. Each member of the group will have designated roles/responsibilities. One group member will be the facilitator for the group. This stude nt will be responsible for setting up the zoom invites, creating a folder in google drive including but not limited to the meeting minutes, literature , the timeline for the study , IRB proposal, letters of permission, copy of survey or other instrumentation , if applicable Students are expected to meet with their group separate from meeting with their mentor during the spring and fall semesters . Mentor meetings will occur approximately every 2 weeks in the spring and the following fall semesters . Each student group will submit a literature review, research question and method for review, in addition to an IRB application by the end of the spring semester. Students are encouraged to use information from the library presentation that was held during the first se mester and/or contact the librarian for information related to conducting lit erature review and referencing with Endnote a s well as using APA format (7th edition) . Each student will find a nd select a minimum of 6 research articles on the topic of choice. It is recommended that students use a shared document as to avoid repetition of articles. The group will then work together to prepare a 5- 8-page literature review. This document synthesizes all the papers read by the students in a research group into one cogent review, culminating in the purpose, rationale, research questions(s), and hypotheses . Each student group prepares a Method section. Each student group submits an IRB application by the end of HHS 551. During the fall prior to HHS 594, students are expected to: 26 Test their research hypotheses/carry out their research study. Meet with their mentor every 2 -3 weeks as well as meet with their group separate from their mentor. During HHS 594, in the spring, stu dents are expected to: This course will provide the students the necessary tools to prepare and present a professional poster illustrating their research study. Students are required to write a paper summarizing their capstone project for submission to a journal or an abstract for a professional presentation to an association, for example, ASHA, NYSSLHA, or another organization. Additionally, each student group should submit an abstract of 200 words to their mentor and capstone instructor 2 months prior to the presentation date. Create a professional poster with literature, research question/hypotheses, methodology (participants, materials and procedures), results (statistical analysis, tables and figures), discussion (clinical implications, limitations, and future research) . The students will present their posters to the department and School of Health Sciences. Each member of the group should be prepared to present part of their presentation. Each student group should prepare a handout which should be submitted for approval to their mentor and capston e instructor one month prior to the presentation. The rubrics for this summative assessment are in the appendices. 2. A Clinical Practice Presentation which is the summative ass essment for the clinical component of the program. Students are required to complete this presentation in the last semester of the program. The rubric for the presentation is in the appendices. 3. A Clinical Portfolio which is a summative assessment for the c linical component of the program. Students are expected to organize clinical evidence in a binder, including, Midterm and Final Evaluations for all Clinicals, Research Training Certification (RCR and Human Participants Training), Capstone Project Paper, Ev idence - Based Practice Presentation, Resume, Diagnostic Evaluation, and one written sample from each clinical. Each semester during the student's advisement session, the student will bring his/her/they portfolio for the advisor to review.

Such students may select, but shall not be guaranteed acceptance to an alternate clinical site, and may not be able to complete program requirements needed for graduation. 2.Criminal history screening includes a review of criminal convictions and probation. The following factors will be considered for individuals with criminal history: The nature of the crime and its relationship to the position The amount of time elapsed since the occurrence The number of convictions The age of the person at the time of occurrence Whether accepting the individual for clinical instruction would pose an unreasonable risk to the facility, it s employees or its patients Any information produced by the person regarding their rehabilitation and good conduct 3.Students may provide consent for criminal background checks through the CastleBranch portal. 4.CastleBranch will analyze the criminal history report and determine if a student has a criminal conviction. CastleBranch will notify the respective Health Sciences School representative for any student with a criminal conviction. 5.The School representative will initiate a meeting with the Criminal Backg round Clearance Committee 5.11 Policy for student criminal background checks and drug screening Stony Brook University Health Sciences Schools are dedicated to preparing students in a variety of careers in medical facilities, social services organizations, and other institutions. The Health Sciences Schools require that all students participating in internship s, practicums, clinical rotations, or otherwise working at Stony Brook Medicine facilities or other clinical training sites comply with the placement requirements of each respective clinical facility. Clinical sites increasingly request students to complet e criminal background checks and drug screening to meet the requirements for placement. To facilitate placement at a clinical facility, the Health Sciences Schools will collaborate with CastleBranch, Inc. to help students obtain criminal background checks and drug screening. CastleBranch is a vendor that specializes in higher education screening. Students will set up student -pay accounts with CastleBranch to complete criminal background checks and drug screening that are required by clinical sites. Stude nts will be responsible for paying CastleBranch directly and entering into an End User Agreement to govern their use of the system. Stony Brook University will not process payments. The Health Sciences Schools will certify students' eligibility for clinic al placements based on the results of CastleBranch's criminal background checks and drug screening. CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS (Hereinafter referred to as \"Committee\"). 6. The Committee shall consult with the Office of General Coun sel to review the student's criminal history and determine their eligibility for placement at the designated clinical site. 3031 DRUG TESTING 8. Students who choose to be placed at a facility that requires drug testing may decide not to consent to the screening. Such students may select, but are not guaranteed acceptance to an alternate clinical site, and may not be able to complete program requirements needed for graduation. 9. Students may provide consent for Drug Screening through the CastleBranch portal . 10. CastleBranch will analyze the toxicology report and determine if a student is eligible for placement at a clinical site. 11. The Health Sciences Schools will use CastleBranch's determination to certify that a student is eligible for placement. The drug test ing services include a Medical Review Officer that will contact any student with a \"non - negative\" test to determine if there is an explanation (prescription, etc.). If a student has a New York State Medical Marijuana Card, the prescription will be verifie d by Stony Brook Medicine. 12. Upon request, subject to applicable confidentiality laws and Stony Brook University policy, the Health Sciences Schools will provide a written statement to indicate a student has completed drug screening and is eligible for place ment. 13. The State of New York defines professional misconduct under New York State Education Law \u00a76530. Professional misconduct includes impairment resulting from being a habitual abuser of alcohol or drugs that impair a practitioner's judgment and performan ce (New York State Education Law \u00a7\u00a76530(7) and (8)). Professional misconduct also results from \"...being convicted of committing an act constituting a crime under New York State Law, or federal law or of the law of another jurisdiction ... which, if committed under the laws of the State of New York, would have been a crime under New York State law\" (New York State Education Law \u00a76530(9)). 14. Students who receive adverse results for toxicology screens and/or criminal background checks may be barred from clinical placements. This will impede a student's ability to complete a degree and/or obtain licensure in the student's chosen field. Eligibility for licensure may depend upon work experience, completion of didactic and clinical education, not having a criminal recor d, and being free of illegal drugs and/or habitual alcohol abuse. Students are responsible for understanding the requirements of certification exams and licensure that are subject to change depending on the applicable certifying boards or agencies. 15. General ly, clinical sites will decline a student's application for a clinical placement if the student has had a positive toxicology screen and/or a record of criminal convictions nexus to the nature and scope of work at the facility. These determinations are fac t and site-specific and may depend on the laws of the jurisdiction in which the site is located. The University will not recommend students for clinical placement without the appropriate clearances. If a student is found to be ineligible due to the results of a toxicology report or criminal background check, the University will withdraw its recommendation regarding the student's placement at the clinical site. If the adverse result(s) are discovered while the student is placed at the clinical site, the Univ ersity will notify the clinical site and will remove the student from their placement. 16. The Office of Student Affairs will: (1) offer resources to the student through the University's Counseling and Psychological Services (\"CAPS\") and the Center for Prevent ion and Outreach (\"CPO\") to assist the student, and/or (2) offer a meeting with University's Student Support Team in the Division of Student Affairs to provide resources and guidance. The student may also be offered participation in educational workshops/c lasses, such as the University's Substance Education course, to support healthy decision -making. Students are strongly recommended to avail themselves of all of the resources offered. Students enrolled in some non-matriculated programs may be ineligible to participate in CAPS or CPO resources but are encouraged to seek assistance through their faculty advisor. 7. Upon request, subject to applicable confidentiality laws and Stony Brook University policy, the respective Health Sciences School will submit a written statement to the clinical placement site that the criminal background chec k was conducted and that the student is eligible for placement.

All office hour options should be listed on the syllabi and published on any relevant course platforms. 5.13 Graduate Student Proficiency in E nglish Screening Procedure and Position Statement Position Statement It is the position of the American Speech -Language -Hearing Association (ASHA) that \"students and professionals in communication sciences and disorders who speak with accents and/or dialec ts can effectively provide speech, language, and audiological services to persons with communication disorders as long as they have the expected level of knowledge in normal and disordered communication, the expected level of diagnostic and clinical case management skills, and if modeling is necessary, are able to model the target phoneme, grammatical feature, or other aspect of speech and language that characterizes the client's particular problem. All individuals speak with an accent and/or dialect; thus, the nonacceptance of individuals into higher education programs or into the professions solely based on the presence of an accent or dialect is discriminatory. Members of ASHA must not discriminate against persons who speak with an accent and/or dialect i n educational programs, employment, or service delivery, and should encourage an understanding of linguistic differences among consumers and the general population.\" American Speech -Language -Hearing Association. (1998). Students and professionals who spe ak English with accents and nonstandard dialects: issues and recommendations [Position Statement]. Available from www.asha.org/policy. The student's advisor will initially screen the student while engaging the student in a conversation, during their initial advisement meeting. This form will remain in the student's file and the Chair of the program will be notified of the results of this screen. The faculty advisor will provide the student with the results and recommendations of the screen. Recommendations may include: 1. Monitoring voice, fluency, articulation, and language throughout clinicals; 2. Referral to an otolaryngologist for voice problems; 3. Evaluation/therapy recommendation for speech, language, and/or fluency issues; 5.14 Procedure to express a complaint about the Speech -Language Pathology Program A complaint about the Speech -Language Pathology program at Stony Brook University may be submitted by any student, instructional staff member, speech -language path ologist, audiologist, and/or member of the public.

All students are expected to respect faculty, staff, fellow colleagues, clients, caregivers, and other professionals during their interactions. If a student violates professional be haviors, as indicated by the ASHA Code of Ethics, and the policies/procedures of the program, the student is at risk of being dismissed from the program. It is expected that all students attend their placement from the beginning of the semester to the end of the semester, regardless of them obtaining the required amount of hours for the placement/graduation. If a student is going to be absent from their placement for any reason the student must notify the placement and the DCE at Stony Brook University of their absence in writing. The number of days the student attends placement depends on various factors including site requirements first and foremost, knowledge and experiences needed by the student, and hours required for that placement. This communication must be agreed upon by all parties -site supervisor, supervisor at Stony Brook University and the student prior to the placement beginning. All students are expected to attend and participate in all scheduled clinical sessions, dates, and meetings as deeme d necessary and appropriate by the site supervisor. The clinical dates, times, and sessions to participate are determined by the site supervisor based on caseload, clinical schedule, and didactic course schedule. The student is to arrive on time to the sit e and active participation in miscellaneous tasks may be required (documentation, billing, meetings) beyond the end time of the clinical day. These professional behaviors are indicated within a student's performance evaluation and grade for the clinical course. 37 Students may be removed from a site due to unprofessional/unethical behavior on the part of the student or supervisor, as well as health or safety. A student cannot choose to leave a clinical site without a process involving the DCE, the Chair of th e department and Site Supervisor. If a student chooses to leave a clinical site on their own, they will fail the clinical and not receive another clinical placement that semester. This will in turn delay their graduation. If a student is asked to leave the site due to their unprofessional/unethical behavior, the student will not be placed at another site that semester and their graduation will be delayed. The student will be placed on probation in the program. If the student is removed from the site due to a cause that is not their own, a second placement is not guaranteed that semester and can impact their graduation. If a student violates professional behaviors, as indicated by the ASHA Code of Ethics, and the policies/procedures of the program, the student will be placed on probation from the program. Dress Code Students are expected to wear appropriate attire during all clinicals (on-campus and off campus clinical experiences). Students are required to purchase scrubs, white staff length labcoat, and liability insurance prior to the beginning of Clinical I. Students must be neat and clean including hair and nails. Students should avoid jewelry and tight clothing that can impact working in a professional practice. In consultation with the site supervisor, the student clinician will maintain professional appearance and dress based on the site (i.e. scrubs or business casual) through out the clinical experience. The student should have their ID badge and it should be visible at all times during the clinical experience. Access to Computers and Storage There are computers located in the library which is the building next to Atlantic Hall. In Atlantic Hall, students are not allowed in the faculty pantry area. Students have their own workspace and have access to microwave in the library. 5.19 Communication, Social Media and Cell Phone Policy Communication and Email Professional courtesy and professional behaviors are expected of students in the classroom, clinical sites, and in online communications.

If a student is not able to attend a clinical session, date, or meeting due to an emergency, the student must contact the site supervisor , clinical instructor for seminar, and DCE to communicate the inability to attend and complete any additional sessions, clinical projects, and/or research assignments in lieu of missed clinical sessions and dates. If a student is unable to attend a class, clinical session, date, or meeting due to an emergency, the student must contact both the site supervisor and DCE to communicate the inability to attend and complete any additional sessions, clinical projects, and/or research assignments in lieu of missed clinical sessions and dates. Social Media The Speech -Language Pathology program recognizes that social networking websites and applications, including, but not limited to, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snap Chat, YouTube and blogs, are a common form of communication. There is potential for misinterpretation of the relationship or the potential sharing protected information via these sites. Students are reminded that that should have NO expectation of privacy on these sites. Students need to be aware that posting certain inform ation is a violation which can be penalized. Offenses could be considered non-academic misconduct or violation of professional behaviors and subject to program procedures and may result in dismissal from the program. Students must adhere to the ASHA Code of Ethics. The SLP department currently has a Facebook and Instagram accounts ( https://www.facebook.com/SLPSBU/ and https://instagram.com/sbuslp2020?utm_medium=copy_link ) The following is a list of online behaviors that are considered violations of social media policy: 1. It is a HIPAA violation if you mention a patient/client with enough information that the person might be identified. This includes posting of image s. 38 2. Posting on social media the names, negative comments or criticisms of faculty, staff, or any clinical or university personnel is not acceptable. 3. Display of vulgar language or photographs that imply disrespect for any individual, group because of age, race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or culture. Please refer to the Diversity and Inclusion Policy in this handbook. Presentation of personal engagement in illegal activities including use of recreational drugs, alcohol or substance abuse. 4. Asking your faculty, clinical instructors, clinical supervisors, or any university or clinical site employee to \"friend\" you on any social media, while a student in the program. Please see additional Social Media guidelines of the university - https://www.stonybrook.edu/social/guidelines/ Cell Phone Students are not permitted to use cell phones in the simulation lab, or classrooms.

Any violation of these policies will be documented as a professional behavior violation. 5.20 Printing Policy All registered Stony Brook students are provided with a semester long quota of ~1500 pages ($75) in the SINC Sites, Health Sciences Library, and Residential Computing Centers or by using the Print From Anywhere service. Funding for student printing comes from the Student Technology Fee. Stony Brook uses the Pharos system to manage printing. Students can access the Print Center to check the status of their jobs and their quota. Color printing is now part of the student print quota, with color printing available in the Main Library SINC Site, Central Reading Room, and Health Science Center Library! In order to print, send print jobs to the print queue from a SINC Site computer, personal computer, iPad or other mobile devices using the Print From Anywhere software , web browser , or email . Students need their Stony Brook University ID card to release their print jobs. Single -sided pages print at a cost of $0.05 per page and double -sided pages print at a cost of $0.08 per sheet. Color printing costs $0.25 per page and double -sided pages print at a cost of $0.40 per sheet. Printing duplex, or on both sides of a sheet of paper, saves you money and saves trees! Users who have run out of print quota for the semester can choose to put money on their Wolfie Wallet account and use the funds to supplement their print quota. When logged into a Pharos Release Station, both balances will be displayed. If you have both print quota and funds on your Wolf ie Wallet account, the print job will be charged to your print quota first. When that runs out, the remaining balance will be charged against your Wolfie Wallet account. This type of transaction will take place using the Card Readers in the Main Library SINC Site, Central & North Reading Rooms and Engineering SINC Site. For More Information about Printing in a SINC Site visit this DoIT webpage: https://it.stonybrook.edu/services/printing 5.21 Policy for Viewing/Obtaining Records and Retention of Files Current students will have access to their files in the presence of their faculty advisor.

Additional services are available through the Wo/Men's and Gender Resource Center . The Stony Brook University Employee Assistance Program provides confidential information, assessment and referral services to employees, family members and retirees. Stony Brook has a Behavior Assessment Committee that meets regularly for the sharing of information and the coordination of responses to at -risk/ distressed students. There is a p rocess in place for review, assessment and referral through Student Affairs. A Critical Incident Management Committee of senior Administrators and Emergency Management personnel meet bi -weekly to review incidents, status of programs and operational needs. Outreach efforts have already begun to familiarize faculty and staff with reporting procedures and expectations when a student is disruptive or distressed. This effort is being coordinated by the Center for Prevention and Outreach , a new unit in the Division of Student Affairs. A brochure was recently updated and distributed to all faculty and another one is being d eveloped for staff which describes these protocols. The brochures also contain resources and lists offices for faculty and staff to contact if the need arises and/or if they have questions. The Center for Prevention and Outreach has also developed and impl emented a one -class session curriculum module, which includes depression/suicide prevention and bystander intervention. The session is being presented to all incoming freshman as part of the SBU101 course required for all new students. Disability Support Services assists students with disabilities in accessing the many resources of the University. Individuals with visual, mobility and hearing impairment as well as those with hidden disabilities such as chronic medical conditions, psychological, and learning disabilities are invited to make use of the services and equipment available. Student Health Services offers co mprehensive and cost -effective health services for both medical and psychological health problems.

If you are concerned about or are contemplating suicide, please go to Ulifeline . 5.23 Weather Emergency Policy Long Island has a climate that is similar to other coastal areas of the Northeastern United States; it has warm, humid summers and cold winters. The Atlantic Ocean helps bring afternoon sea breezes that temper the heat in the warmer 40 months and limit the frequency and severity of thunde rstorms. Severe thunderstorms are not uncommon, especially when they approach the island from the mainland areas of the Bronx, Westchester County and Connecticut in the northwest. Measurable snow falls every winter and in many winters one or more intense storms (called a Nor'easter) produce blizzard conditions with snowfalls of 1 -2 feet (30 - 60 cm) and near -hurricane force winds. Long Island is somewhat vulnerable to hurricanes. Its northern location and relatively cool waters tend to weaken storms to below hurricane strength by the time they reach Long Island, although despite this, some storms have made landfall at Category 1 or greater strength. In the wintertime, temperatures are warmer than areas further inland (especially in the night and early morn ing hours), sometimes causing a snowstorm further inland to fall as rain or mixed precipitation on the island. For weather -related information and/or school closings, monitor the SB Advisory page or call: 631-632-SNOW (7669) | 631-444-SNOW (7669) Students are required to sign up for alerts on the following site for information about weather emergencies: https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/emergency/alerts/ 5.24 Critical Incident Management and Emergency Communications Members of Stony Brook's Emergency Management Team have been working with Administration on a review of policies, procedures and programs to respond to and manage critical incidents on campus. The review addresses risk assessment and mental health issues, emergency response, communications technology and other general recommendations. The following is a summary of the assessment and actions taken to date. Please note that this list is not inclusive of all actions that can and will be done in the future, as this will be a continuous improvement process. Emergency Communications 1. Stony Brook has a Communications Plan for emergency responders using cell phones, pagers, email and portable radios to ensure communications and interoperability with each other and external agencies such as the Suffolk County Police and local fire departments. Emergency information is communicated to the campus commu nity by way of our fire alarm systems, e -mail, web site, campus cable TV system and radio station (WUSB 90.1 FM) and external media sources. 2. Text, Voice and E-mail Messaging : Stony Brook has implemented a mass notification system with a private vendor to provide urgent communications to members of the campus community. Stony Brook University officials can also generate emergency messages by utilizing NY Alert, a similar system developed by the State Emergency Management Office (SEMO). 3. Outdoor Warning Siren: Stony Brook University has installed an outdoor siren alert on the University's main campus. While some individuals may hear the siren indoors, the siren is designed to be heard OUTDOORS ONLY. In the event of a true emergency that presents a safety concern, the University will sound the outdoor siren alert, which will last 60-seconds, and the following actions should be taken: S STOP Stop what you are doing. 41 O OBSERVE Observe your immediate surroundings for danger. S SHELTER Seek shelter and additional information. 4. Digital Signage: A software package has been purchased and new digital signage is being planned for installation in large assembly areas in campus buildi ngs. The LCD displays will be centrally controlled with content directed to a particular geographic area. 5. Voice Fire/PA Systems: Fire alarm systems on campus are being upgraded to add additional voice -capable systems and to optimize their voice capability . This will allow us to broadcast an alternate emergency tone and voice message over the speaker system. 6. Campus Safety Website : A new Campus Safety \"Staying Safe on Campus\" website has been est ablished as a resource for the campus community. The website has links to important emergency, safety, security, health, counseling and other information. 7. An Emergency Command Vehicle (SUV), equipped with communications equipment will be used as a mobile command post at major incidents where University officials will work together in a unified command with external agencies. Emergency Management and Response 1. Stony Brook University has a comprehensive Emergency Management (All Hazards) Plan that establishes the policy, procedures, and organizational structure to respond, control and recover from emergency situations, using the National Incident Management Training System (NIMS). 2. An Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is used by a team of University Officials, the Incident Commander, and Command Staff to evaluate situations and plan for the effective management of the people, organizations, and resources utilized in response to emergencies. 3. Emergency Responders, including University Police Officers, Fire Marshals, Building Managers, Safety Wardens, and Residential Hall staff respond to and evaluate emergency situations using the Incident Command System (ICS). 4. Critical Incident Plans and Training: Our University Police Department, in partnership with the Suffolk County Police Department (SCPD), has reviewed Critical Incident Response Plans and provided training to all UPD Officers for \"active shooting\" situations. In addition, UPD Officers have received training on the National Incident Management System (NIMS), Mental Health Disorders, Firearms Training and Incident Response. Table -top exercises are frequently conducted as pa rt of an effort to better prepare our Emergency Responders for an actual event. 5. Fire Safety: Our University Fire Marshals have recently expanded operations to provide fire safety coverage round - the-clock (24/7). Fire Marshals are highly trained for respo nse to fires, fire alarms, hazardous material incidents, technical rescues, and other emergencies. They work closely with local volunteer fire departments which facilitates the response and recovery from emergency situations. A number of fire prevention ac tivities are held annually during the month of September during Campus Fire Safety Month. For additional information, please contact: Lawrence Zacarese Assistant Chief of Police / Director of Emergency Management Phone:(631) 632-6540 Email: Lawrence.Zacarese@stonybrook.edu 42 5.25 Evacuation Procedures When evacuating your building or work area: Stay calm; do not rush.

All individuals speak with an accent and/or dialect; thus, the nonacceptance of individuals into higher education programs or into the professions solely based on the presence of an accent or dialect is discriminatory. Members of ASHA must not discriminate against persons who speak with an accent and/or dialect in educational programs, employment, or service delivery, and should encourage an understanding of linguistic differences among consumers and the general population.

Student Signature: Date: Director of Clinical Education Signature: Date: Department Chair Signature: Date: Stony Brook University Department of Speech Language Pathology Generic Abilities Assessment Student Name: ____ ________ ____ Date: ___________ Student Advisor: __________ Directions: The ten Generic Abilities listed in the shaded boxes are to be de veloped by the student during the academic phase of their professional education. This form is to be used primarily as a self -assessment tool by students. Rank each core ability within the shaded box in accordance with the descriptors below the numbered line. The ranking represents a continuum for expected student progress during the academic portion of the curriculum. A separate form will be used for self -assessment during the clinical portion of the program. The descriptors below the boxes serve as e xamples of the behaviors expected for that particular ability. The ranking is to be completed by each student: - Each Fall and Spring semester. - Prior to required faculty/student advisement conferences. Students may enter the program with several of the se abilities fully developed. Other abilities may require further development. Ranking should be done accordingly. Students are expected to submit this form prior to their scheduled advisement session. Students should use feedback from multiple sources when self -assessing. When asked, students should be able to support their rankings with specific program related examples. Feedback might come from: - Written comments - Non-verbal messages - Self awareness - Faculty - Supervisors - Classmates A differen t self -assessment form is used for the clinical education phase of the program.
