Reviews \"We have seen a growth in complementary or alternative forms of healing which appear to challenge the hegemony of biomedicine and the ever expanding domain of the medical drugs industry. Dr. Stuart McClean has carried out unusual anthropological and social science fieldwork. Far from the metropolis and wealthy clientele, he examines the use and practice of crystal and spiritual healing in a distinctive centre in the North of England which, in combination with other approaches such as aromatherapy and the use of music, emphasises crystal healing. This is a unique in-depth perspective on such a centre and in contrast to non localised studies with dubious generalizations ... Dr. McClean presents an impressive analysis of a range of postmodern theories which he relates to practices and beliefs about biomedicine and ideas about the body. Postmodernism has seen a decline in trust in standard medicine. Biomedicine de-legitimizes the need for personal meaning in illness. Not only are we confronted with dissatisfaction with depersonalized techniques, but there are also signs that biomedicine is not as neutral and as therefore as scientific as it purports to be ...\" - (from the Preface) Judith Okely, Professor Emerita, University of Hull \" ... The focus of this study is upon the healers and not the clients, upon the collective ethos of the Centre as well as upon the ideologies and practices of the healers. While the ethnographic detail is fascinating in its own right and would make a powerful contribution to this growing field of complementary health, the book's significance is far more than regional. The author relates his analysis to the development place of CAM healing practices and to the changing conditions of modernity and postmodernity, individuation and individuality, the philosophy of the body, lay beliefs and the human capacity for metaphorization ...\" - Dr. Iain R. Edgar, University of Durham \" ... While there have been numerous books on the professional development of CAMs (such as acupuncture and osteopathy, texts that focus upon the integration of CAM into mainstream health services and on the motivations of people who use CAMs, ethnographies of the more esoteric CAMs are unheard of ... In this book, Dr. McClean allows the reader to step into a world of healing normally hidden to the public. The rigor and innovation in the author's approach is stunning: this work will challenge accepted notions of what CAM offers users, what healers actually do to create healing and how they understand their work ...\" - Dr. Geraldine Lee-Treweek, Manchester Metropolitan University Table of Contents Preface by Judith Okely Acknowledgements Introduction 1.
