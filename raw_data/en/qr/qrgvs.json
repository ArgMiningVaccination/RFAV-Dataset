Treatment was perceived as fairly safe but discussions emerged more recently as to whether herb induced liver injury (HILI) from herbal TCM is a major issue; Methods: To analyze clinical and case characteristics of HILI caused by herbal TCM, we undertook a selective literature search in the PubMed database with the search items Traditional Chinese Medicine, TCM, alone and combined with the terms herbal hepatotoxicity or herb induced liver injury; Results: HILI caused by herbal TCM is rare and similarly to drugs can be caused by an unpredictable idiosyncratic or a predictable intrinsic reaction. Clinical features of liver injury from herbal TCM products are variable, and specific diagnostic biomarkers such as microsomal epoxide hydrolase, pyrrole-protein adducts, metabolomics, and microRNAs are available for only a few TCM herbs. The diagnosis is ascertained if alternative causes are validly excluded and causality levels of probable or highly probable are achieved applying the liver specific RUCAM (Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method) as the most commonly used diagnostic tool worldwide. Case evaluation may be confounded by inappropriate or lacking causality assessment, poor herbal product quality, insufficiently documented cases, and failing to exclude alternative causes such as infections by hepatotropic viruses including hepatitis E virus infections; Conclusion: Suspected cases of liver injury from herbal TCM represent major challenges that deserve special clinical and regulatory attention to improve the quality of case evaluations and ascertain patients' safety and benefit.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2016-07-19", "cleaned_text": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Herbal Hepatotoxicity: RUCAM and the Role of Novel Diagnostic Biomarkers Such as MicroRNAs [https://doi.org/10.3390/medicines3030018](https://doi.org/10.3390/medicines3030018) Introduction [1](#B1-medicines-03-00018), [2](#B2-medicines-03-00018), [3](#B3-medicines-03-00018)]. This was achieved through efforts closing up its gaps with modern medicine [ [4](#B4-medicines-03-00018), [5](#B5-medicines-03-00018)], considering developing new drugs [ [16](#B16-medicines-03-00018), [17](#B17-medicines-03-00018), [18](#B18-medicines-03-00018)]. The Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology 2015 will certainly further inspire modern TCM research in the near future, although the Nobel Prize committee did not specify that the prize was for TCM [ [19](#B19-medicines-03-00018)]. Instead, the 2015 Nobel Prize was awarded to Youyou Tu for her pioneering work in drug development originating from herbal TCM and her discovery of artemisinin for the treatment of malaria [ [19](#B19-medicines-03-00018), [20](#B20-medicines-03-00018)]. Artemisinin is derived from the herbal TCM Qing Hao (Artemisia annua L.), known for more than two thousand years as a Chinese herbal medicine for various ailments [ [19](#B19-medicines-03-00018), [20](#B20-medicines-03-00018), [21](#B21-medicines-03-00018), [22](#B22-medicines-03-00018), [23](#B23-medicines-03-00018)]. The initial breakthrough in the discovery of artemisinin dates back to 4 October 1991, when an extract derived from Artemisia annua was found to be 100% effective against parasitemia in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei and in monkeys with Plasmodium cynomolgi [ [22](#B22-medicines-03-00018)]. After ascertaining that the extract was safe for human use, clinical efficacy was tested in the Chinese Hainan province in trials with patients infected with both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum [ [22](#B22-medicines-03-00018)]. The results were encouraging: patients treated with the extract experienced rapid disappearance of symptoms such as fever and decrease of parasitemia, whereas patients receiving chloroquine did not. Artemisinin and its derivatives such as artesunate and arthemeter are now successfully used to treat patients with malaria by Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium falciparum, preferring a combination with antimalarial drugs other than artemisinin, called artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), and banning artemisinin-based monotherapy that may promote the risk of antimalarial drug resistance [ [23](#B23-medicines-03-00018)]. Malaria is transmitted among humans by female mosquitoes of the Anopheles genus, which take blood meals from patients with malaria to carry out egg production; such blood meals are the link between the human and the mosquito hosts in the parasite life circle and enable the transfer of malaria through infected mosquitos by biting humans [ [24](#B24-medicines-03-00018)]. Based on treatment with ACTs together with other approaches such as use of insecticides and insecticide-treated mosquito nets, the WHO stated that the number of patients with malaria and malaria-related mortality has been drastically reduced within recent years [ [23](#B23-medicines-03-00018)], and there is no question that most of this improvement is attributable the work of Youyou Tu with Artemisia annua. [22](#B22-medicines-03-00018)]. This is not in line with mainstream philosophy of herbal TCM that prefers the use of a bundle of herbs rather than to focus on a single herb or even a single molecule [ [25](#B25-medicines-03-00018), [26](#B26-medicines-03-00018)], as opposed to what Youyou Tu did [ [22](#B22-medicines-03-00018)]. In 1996, she started her project against malaria by investigating more than 2000 Chinese herbal preparations and identified 640 hits that had possible antimalarial properties. More than 380 extracts obtained from around 200 herbs were evaluated, and a high antimalarial activity was found in an extract derived from Artemisia annua as prepared according to \"A Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies\" by Ge Hong (from 248 to 346 AD). Originating from artemisinin with a molecular weight of 282 Da and a molecular formula of C15H22O5, dihydroartemisinin was found to be more stable and 10 times more effective than artemisinin, and adding a hydroxyl group to the molecule provided more opportunities for developing new artemisinin derivatives through esterification [ [22](#B22-medicines-03-00018)]. The fascinating route from a TCM herb via a molecule to a drug is finally highlighted again at the molecular level, now in the human erythrocytes infected with plasmodia [ [20](#B20-medicines-03-00018)]. The molecular basis of treatment efficacy includes among several mechanisms the cleavage of artemisinin's endoperoxide bridge by a Fe(II) Fenton, which is facilitated by heme-iron originating from hemoglobin degradation in the parasites' food vacuoles [ [20](#B20-medicines-03-00018), [27](#B27-medicines-03-00018)]. Autodigestion of plasmodium food vacuoles is achieved following their damage by hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions [ [20](#B20-medicines-03-00018)]. Consequently, artemisinin with its derivatives is a drug with a specific molecular target in a specific parasitic disease [ [20](#B20-medicines-03-00018), [27](#B27-medicines-03-00018)]; toxicity has not been found in clinical studies with normal doses [ [27](#B27-medicines-03-00018)]. Expectations are high that more hidden drug champions can be derived from herbal TCM with high efficacy and little harm, providing a favorable benefit-risk profile. [7](#B7-medicines-03-00018), [28](#B28-medicines-03-00018), [29](#B29-medicines-03-00018)]. Herb induced liver injury (HILI) from herbal TCM may be severe and rarely leads to acute liver failure (ALF), which is often life-threatening unless liver transplantation is performed. These serious clinical courses are a particular challenge for clinicians caring for these patients with suspected HILI, considering that the indication of therapy is often vague. 2. Data Sources and Searches 2.1. Search Terms 2.2. Data Extraction 3. Herbal Traditional Chinese Medicine, Its History, Philosophy and Challenges 3.1. History [6](#B6-medicines-03-00018), [10](#B10-medicines-03-00018)]. Ancient medical books are historical examples for this broad empirical knowledge. Among these are formulas for 52 diseases (Wu Shi er Bing Fang, second century BC), Yellow Emperor's Canon of Internal Medicine (Huang Di Nei Jing, Later Han from 25 to 220 AD), and Prescription from the Golden Chamber (Shang Han Lun and Jin Gui Yao Lue, from 200 BC to 200 AD) [ [30](#B30-medicines-03-00018), [31](#B31-medicines-03-00018), [32](#B32-medicines-03-00018)]. For some years, Chinese intellectuals, scientists, physicians, and politicians have shown a clear preference towards the rational Western science and medicine [ [33](#B33-medicines-03-00018)]. [33](#B33-medicines-03-00018)]. The future of TCM was seen in the unification of historical Chinese and modern Western medicine, based on molecular biological legitimation [ [33](#B33-medicines-03-00018)]. Part of the Chinese government would obviously favor a rigorous modernization of herbal TCM that can be used to effectively treat human diseases. 3.2. Philosophical Background [6](#B6-medicines-03-00018), [10](#B10-medicines-03-00018)]. In short, core elements of the TCM philosophy are ideas primarily related to \"yin and yang\", two opposing yet complementary forces; disease results from an imbalance of these forces [ [6](#B6-medicines-03-00018)]. Philosophical support is provided by the \"Five Phases\" as the interaction among the five elements: wood, earth, water, fire and metal [ [6](#B6-medicines-03-00018)]. To meet the requirements of herbal therapy according to TCM philosophy, herbal TCM products are commonly blends of four to six different herbs [ [28](#B28-medicines-03-00018)]. This approach allows for disease treatment via different molecular disease targets. [9](#B9-medicines-03-00018), [10](#B10-medicines-03-00018)]. As an example, treatment protocol of herbal TCM is established based on a syndrome differentiation. Clinical signs and symptoms are clustered around uniquely 'Chinese' nosological categories and diagnostic terms, such as stagnation of meridians, liver-Qi stagnation, blood stasis, dampness, and others [ [34](#B34-medicines-03-00018)]. The doctor as specialist for TCM takes a detailed history of physical and vegetative symptoms, augmented by information gained through somatic signs. Based on this \"phenomenological evaluation\", he arrives at a so-called \"energetic diagnosis\" that is based on the conceptual framework of TCM. For instance, rheumatoid arthritis shows so-called syndrome \"heat-toxicity\", or \"wind-damp-hot\" [ [35](#B35-medicines-03-00018), [36](#B36-medicines-03-00018), [37](#B37-medicines-03-00018)]. For conditions such as these, specific herbal TCM products are available [ [38](#B38-medicines-03-00018), [39](#B39-medicines-03-00018), [40](#B40-medicines-03-00018)]. 3.3. of reports and analyses focused on important issues related to the use of herbal its integration into modern Western medicine will not easily be accomplished due to differences in philosophy and approaches of diagnoses and therapy. In addition, TCM philosophy requires that a TCM physician is involved in the treatment, who will not always be available for consumers who order TCM herbals via the internet. [7](#B7-medicines-03-00018)]. In addition, the worldwide use of herbal TCM is well recognized, but robust quantitative results are not available. This lack is due to insufficient definitions of consumer cohorts or the heterogeneity of both herbal product groups and treatment modalities. For instance, in many reports on traditional medicine, traditional herbal medicine, natural medicine, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), there is a mix of various treatments including herbal TCM which is often not separately mentioned and discussed. A similar problem relates to reports on general TCM, which may include practices unrelated to herbal TCM such as acupuncture, moxibustion (burning a herb above the skin to apply heat to acupuncture points), Tui Na (Chinese therapeutic massage), dietary therapy, or Tai Chi (shadow boxing) and Qi Gong (practices that combine specific movements or postures, coordinated breathing, and mental focus) [ [6](#B6-medicines-03-00018)]. [42](#B42-medicines-03-00018)]. Despite these accurate figures in China, a realistic impression on the quantitative use of herbal TCM in other countries requires a more sophisticated analytical approach, also to quantify the worldwide consumption of herbal TCM products. Of note, in other Asian countries, TCM became popular and is called for instance \"Traditional Asian Medicine\" (TAM) or \"Traditional Occidental Medicine\" (TOM), and in Japan also Kampo medicine [ [53](#B53-medicines-03-00018)]. The basic principles of TCM are identical or vary only a little between countries; hence, TCM as the overarching term is warranted and used in this review article in order to facilitate the discussions on the major TCM related issues. [Table 1](#medicines-03-00018-t001)). 3.4. Integration of Ancient herbal TCM and modern medicine have evolved under different empirical, theoretical, philosophical, and cultural conditions, each attempting to establish cornerstones of valid diagnostic and therapeutic principles and to provide efficient healthcare. However, the opinion prevailed that the situation of ancient herbal TCM is partially disappointing [ [10](#B10-medicines-03-00018), [55](#B55-medicines-03-00018)], requiring substantial improvements with the tentative aim to develop a pragmatic modern herbal TCM that meets the needs of modern medicine and possibly combines both medicinal cultures by bridging the gap between the herbal TCM and Western medicine [ [10](#B10-medicines-03-00018)]. 3.5. New TCM Drugs and Approaches of Research and Development [8](#B8-medicines-03-00018), and camptothecin derivatives used for cancer therapy are good examples of drug development based on herbal TCM [ [57](#B57-medicines-03-00018)]. In the future, several herbal TCM products [ [57](#B57-medicines-03-00018), [58](#B58-medicines-03-00018)] including artemisinin [ [57](#B57-medicines-03-00018)] will have a high potential to advance drug discovery and development in a major world market, which stands at about $83 billion, while Europe accounts for over 50% of the total [ [49](#B49-medicines-03-00018)]. Perhaps with few exceptions [ [8](#B8-medicines-03-00018), [58](#B58-medicines-03-00018)], the lack of robust evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is hindering acceptance of herbal TCM by the mainstream Western healthcare [ [9](#B9-medicines-03-00018), [10](#B10-medicines-03-00018), [42](#B42-medicines-03-00018)]. 3.6. Therapeutic Efficacy [6](#B6-medicines-03-00018), [7](#B7-medicines-03-00018)]. Through randomized controlled trials (RCTs), multiple studies attempted to validly establish efficacy of treatments by herbal TCM [ [9](#B9-medicines-03-00018), [10](#B10-medicines-03-00018), [42](#B42-medicines-03-00018), [43](#B43-medicines-03-00018)]. In fact, publications of TCM trials are abundant [ [42](#B42-medicines-03-00018), [43](#B43-medicines-03-00018)], considering publication figures of around 10,000 [ [43](#B43-medicines-03-00018)] or 26,263 [ [42](#B42-medicines-03-00018)], but their scientific quality is limited [ [9](#B9-medicines-03-00018), [10](#B10-medicines-03-00018), [42](#B42-medicines-03-00018), [43](#B43-medicines-03-00018)]. One of these studies identified 37,252 Chinese language articles in TCM journals published in mainland China, with clinical trials recognized in 26,263 out of 37,252 articles, corresponding to 70.5% [ [42](#B42-medicines-03-00018)]. Out of these 26,263 clinical trials, 7422 were initially identified as RCTs, equivalent to 28.3%, but among these 7422 trials, only 1329 (17.9%) were truly randomized [ [42](#B42-medicines-03-00018)]. [42](#B42-medicines-03-00018)]. All reports were searched according to guidelines of the Cochrane Centre, and a comprehensive quality assessment of each RCT was completed using a modified version of the CONSORT checklist [ [42](#B42-medicines-03-00018)]. The poor quality of many TCM RCTs [ [42](#B42-medicines-03-00018)] was continuously discussed in various reports during the last decades, as summarized recently [ [10](#B10-medicines-03-00018)]. [9](#B9-medicines-03-00018)]. It is well recognized that planning and performing RCTs, data analysis and compilation are cumbersome, time consuming, and expensive [ [9](#B9-medicines-03-00018)], with additional efforts having to be put into editorial and reviewing work. Unless strict criteria are applied for clinical trials of alternative medicinal systems including herbal TCM, these studies will not be regarded as valid. For most analyses such as those evaluated in this review, major quality criteria are violated, including primary research hypothesis formulation, clinical inclusion criteria and outcome parameters, and appropriate statistical analysis [ [10](#B10-medicines-03-00018)]. RCTs require clearly defined drug and usage characteristics, which cannot be provided for herbal TCM formulae that are prescribed individually and not uniformly for each patient. [Figure 1](#medicines-03-00018-f001)). 3.7. Safety [59](#B59-medicines-03-00018)], TCM herbs may be classified as good ones, bad ones, and ugly ones [ [25](#B25-medicines-03-00018)]. For some herbal medicines including herbal TCM products, safety concerns have been expressed regarding rare adverse reactions that were not always transient but occasionally resulted in a severe clinical course and fatality [ [2](#B2-medicines-03-00018), [7](#B7-medicines-03-00018), [12](#B12-medicines-03-00018), [28](#B28-medicines-03-00018), [29](#B29-medicines-03-00018)]; attempts to ignore severe adverse reactions should be resisted [ [55](#B55-medicines-03-00018)]. Under these conditions, manufacturers and regulatory agencies are obliged to provide good product quality of efficient herbal products including herbal TCM, ascertaining consumer safety [ [12](#B12-medicines-03-00018), [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018), [60](#B60-medicines-03-00018), [61](#B61-medicines-03-00018)]. Certainly, the majority of TCM plants are harmless and well tolerated by most consumers [ [3](#B3-medicines-03-00018), [13](#B13-medicines-03-00018)]. As with any conventional treatment, the use of herbal TCM products may be associated with only mild and transient adverse effects that are without clinical relevance ( [Table 2](#medicines-03-00018-t002)) [ [3](#B3-medicines-03-00018), [13](#B13-medicines-03-00018)]. [Table 2](#medicines-03-00018-t002)) to values of ALT (Alanine aminotransferase) <5 N (upper limit of normal), while liver injury is based on ALT 5 N [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. In the three cases of liver injury, RUCAM based causality was only \"possible\". [Table 1](#medicines-03-00018-t001)) [ [2](#B2-medicines-03-00018), [28](#B28-medicines-03-00018), [29](#B29-medicines-03-00018), [60](#B60-medicines-03-00018)] and [ [13](#B13-medicines-03-00018), [62](#B62-medicines-03-00018), [63](#B63-medicines-03-00018), [64](#B64-medicines-03-00018), [65](#B65-medicines-03-00018)], herbal TCM products require a more strict regulatory surveillance in China and elsewhere [ [8](#B8-medicines-03-00018), [12](#B12-medicines-03-00018), [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018)]. Some efforts appear promising [ [12](#B12-medicines-03-00018)], provided the principles of current Good Agricultural Practices (cGAP) and current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) are fulfilled [ [8](#B8-medicines-03-00018), [12](#B12-medicines-03-00018), [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018), [60](#B60-medicines-03-00018)]. In essence, herbal TCM products intended for medicinal purposes and fulfilling regulatory requirements of efficacy and safety, should all be classified as regulated herbal drugs [ [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018)]. Such strict regulatory surveillance should be expanded to dietary supplements (DS); most of these include herbal ingredients [ [61](#B61-medicines-03-00018)]. The abundance of DS is frightening, as for instance more than 50,000 DS were marketed in the United States between 1995 and 2015, a real regulatory challenge [ [61](#B61-medicines-03-00018)]. A more stringent regulatory approach would reduce the number of products and allow for more transparency [ [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018)]. [Figure 2](#medicines-03-00018-f002)) [ [45](#B45-medicines-03-00018), [46](#B46-medicines-03-00018), [47](#B47-medicines-03-00018)]. The mix up herb intended for weight loss was consumed by women as tea medication that produced severe nephrotoxic adverse effects. The TCM Aristolochia herbal product contains the carcinogenic aristolochic acid [ [45](#B45-medicines-03-00018)]. Meanwhile, special quality proof methods like TLC (Thin-Layer Chromatography) and HPLC-fingerprint technique (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) of Chinese drugs was able to detect minimal concentrations of these toxic acids in single herb products or herbal drug mixtures in order to avoid cases of poisoning [ [48](#B48-medicines-03-00018)]. In the near future, the barcode fingerprint DNA analysis will also be available, in order to supplement the chromatographic analysis [ [48](#B48-medicines-03-00018)]. All these methods should help to fulfill the basic requirements for quality proof of Chinese herbs including botanical authenticity, species diversity, safety check for adulterations, processing of herbal drugs on the bench, optimal extraction methods, and standardization of herbal extract combinations [ [48](#B48-medicines-03-00018), [66](#B66-medicines-03-00018)]. 3.8. Nomenclature [52](#B52-medicines-03-00018), [55](#B55-medicines-03-00018)], especially when scientific reports have to be interpreted in relation to a TCM herb [ [52](#B52-medicines-03-00018)]. Unlike Latin scientific names, CMM names, be they Chinese, pin yin, English, or according to pharmacopoeia, have not been standardized and their use, spelling and occasionally even the plant species to which they refer vary from publication to publication [ [52](#B52-medicines-03-00018)]. The monographs in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia also vary in their species delimitation from one edition to the next, and Latin names should never be derived from Chinese Materia Medica (CMM) names alone. Available as proprietary medicines or crude herbal mixtures, herbal TCM formulae may also differ in composition depending on country or origin, manufacturer or even individual practitioner [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. These difficulties are amplified by the large number of TCM plants in China [ [10](#B10-medicines-03-00018)]. [67](#B67-medicines-03-00018), [68](#B68-medicines-03-00018)], being officially recognized and described in detail by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia [ [67](#B67-medicines-03-00018), [69](#B69-medicines-03-00018)], including herbs commonly used, regional variations and folk medicine variants. The CMM [ [69](#B69-medicines-03-00018)] is a reference book that also describes thousands of plant preparations [ [6](#B6-medicines-03-00018)], including some nonbotanical elements (animal parts and minerals) [ [6](#B6-medicines-03-00018), [53](#B53-medicines-03-00018), [55](#B55-medicines-03-00018), [67](#B67-medicines-03-00018)] incorrectly classified as herbal medicines [ [34](#B34-medicines-03-00018)]. Outside of China, only around 500 Chinese herbs are commonly used [ [67](#B67-medicines-03-00018)]. 4. TCM Herbs with Published Claims of Hepatotoxic Potential 4.1. Compilation of TCM Herbal Products with Reported Claims of Among the published reports, a large number of assessments provide only a possible causality level, which is fair enough but in essence of little clinical or regulatory relevance. Published reports are therefore hardly assessable by others due to incomplete data presentation and confounding variables. These include for instance lacking a temporal relationship between product use and the occurrence of liver injury itself poorly defined, unclear product description and quality, insufficient exclusion of alternative causes including viral and namely HEV infections, and no data on preexisting liver diseases. Despite these limitations, stakeholders including regulatory agencies, physicians, and patients taking these herbal TCM products are informed that such hepatic reactions could occur ( [Table 3](#medicines-03-00018-t003)). 4.2. Worldwide Reports [180](#B180-medicines-03-00018)]. This was followed by 20 publications from 1994 to 2003 and 55 reports from 2004 to 2013. With 28 publications for the period from 2004 to 2008 and with 27 reports from 2009 to 2013, the publication frequency was stable in recent years [ [180](#B180-medicines-03-00018)]. The variability of countries from which the reports originated is high [ [53](#B53-medicines-03-00018)]. Of note, the use of herbal TCM is popular in Germany, but liver injury appears not to be a problem [ [13](#B13-medicines-03-00018), [14](#B14-medicines-03-00018), [183](#B183-medicines-03-00018)], at least in one study, considering that RUCAM based causality in the three cases of liver injury was only possible may be derived from review articles and other publications, which partially covered also large cohorts of transparency and scientific evaluation, spontaneous reports of cases of HILI by TCM submitted to CFDA should be published with a narrative, a list of excluded alternative causes, and a RUCAM based causality assessment [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. This approach would facilitate considerations on how safety of these products can be improved. The top ranking of reporting countries focused on Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, and the United States, whereas reports originating from European countries were unexpectedly scarce, as evidenced by evaluation of selected reports ( [Table 4](#medicines-03-00018-t004)). 5. Narratives of TCM HILI Cases 5.1. An Shu Ling [70](#B70-medicines-03-00018)]. The products were An Shu Ling (syn. Jin Bu Huan) as TCM, \"Ignatia Amara\" and \"Relaxed Wanderer\". Following this treatment for 10 weeks, she experienced acute liver injury and jaundice. Poison specialists at the California Poison Control System in San Francisco searched the Poisindex (Micromedex, Englewood, CO, USA) and found the synonym Jin Bu Huan listed for An Shu Ling, its chemical analysis identified l-tetrahydropalmitine, the hepatotoxic ingredient, present also in Jin Bu Huan that also contains Stephania sinica among other herbs. The two other herbal products were analyzed and contained no known hepatotoxins. The product lot of An Shu Ling was confiscated from the importer-seller, and a public health warning was issued. No additional cases associated with the use of this particular product were reported. Although Jin Bu Huan itself was banned from importation into the United States due to the risk of HILI, this shipment of An Shu Ling reportedly cleared US customs because the shipping invoice mentioned only the Chinese botanical name [ [70](#B70-medicines-03-00018)].

In a recent report from Taiwan, 17 cases associated with poisoning by Ba Jiao Lian were reported [ [72](#B72-medicines-03-00018)]. Podophyllotoxin is one of the main ingredients of the Ba Jiao Lian root and considered to be the toxic agent [ [71](#B71-medicines-03-00018), [72](#B72-medicines-03-00018), [73](#B73-medicines-03-00018)]. However, the increase of the aminotransferases was with predominance of aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) [72](#B72-medicines-03-00018), [73](#B73-medicines-03-00018)]. The increase in AST [ [71](#B71-medicines-03-00018)] could also reflect either an isolated damage of liver mitochondria or muscular damage [ [71](#B71-medicines-03-00018), [73](#B73-medicines-03-00018)] because of the associated increase of creatine phosphokinase [ [71](#B71-medicines-03-00018)]. These uncertainties do not allow for the classification of Ba Jiao Lian as a hepatotoxic TCM herb, and therefore it will not further considered within this review. 5.3. Bai Fang [74](#B74-medicines-03-00018)]. He used Bai Fang as a herbal TCM for an unknown period of time and had an acute HBV infection as concomitant disease. Bai Fang is a herbal mixture that includes Angelica sinensis, Cyperus rotundus, Ginseng, The possible hepatotoxic herb and its suspected ingredient are unknown. The causal role of Bai Fang may be questioned in this case report because of the concomitant acute HBV infection. No other cases were reported involving Bai Fang. 5.4. Bai Xian Pi [75](#B75-medicines-03-00018)], and in three other patients from the United Kingdom, when it was coadministered with other herbs [ [76](#B76-medicines-03-00018), [77](#B77-medicines-03-00018), [78](#B78-medicines-03-00018)]. Fourteen patients from Korea developed ALF due to Dictamnus dasycarpus [ [79](#B79-medicines-03-00018)], and two other Korean patients experienced ALF that needed a liver transplant [ [80](#B80-medicines-03-00018)].

Several herbs are candidates for liver injury, including Ephedra providing the hepatotoxic ephedrine [ [85](#B85-medicines-03-00018)]. For Ephedra Ma Huang. 5.8. Boh Gol Zhee [86](#B86-medicines-03-00018), [87](#B87-medicines-03-00018)] and in three patients in Hong Kong [ [88](#B88-medicines-03-00018)]. Boh Gol Zhee is not a herbal mixture but contains only seeds of Psoralea corylifolia with psoralens as possible hepatotoxic ingredients, especially when used in large amounts [ [86](#B86-medicines-03-00018), [87](#B87-medicines-03-00018), [88](#B88-medicines-03-00018)]. Psoralens are also hepatotoxic candidates in another patient, who experienced severe liver injury after the use of Indian Ayurvedic herbal products [ [89](#B89-medicines-03-00018)]. These included Bakuchi tablets with extracts from Psoralea corylifolia leaves with treat her 5.10. Camellia Sinensis 5.11. Chai Hu [90](#B90-medicines-03-00018)]. In particular, two products were involved: Xiao Chai Hu Tang and Long Dan Xie Gan Tang. In other patients without chronic HBV infection, herbal TCM products containing Bupleurum might be hepatotoxic, see for instance Da Chai Hu Tang [ [91](#B91-medicines-03-00018)], Kamishoyosan [ [92](#B92-medicines-03-00018)], and a report referring to a herbal TCM mixture [ [77](#B77-medicines-03-00018)]. 5.12. Chaso [93](#B93-medicines-03-00018)]. This product contained Camellia sinensis (Green extract is a known weight loss aid, most likely present as extract in the Chaso formula to facilitate weight loss. It was not considered as the offending agent [ [93](#B93-medicines-03-00018)], since the hepatotoxicity of Camellia sinensis extract was unknown in 2003 when Chaso hepatotoxicity was described. Outcome was favorable in all patients including one patient treated with liver transplantation. Chemical analysis of the Chase product showed lack of fenfluramine and heavy metals such as copper, lead, bismuth, cadmium, stibium, stanum, mercury, and chromium, but N-nitroso-fenfluramine was found. N-nitroso-fenfluramine was considered as possible but not yet proven to be a hepatotoxin [ [93](#B93-medicines-03-00018)], similar to other cases of liver injury due to various other slimming aids in the United Kingdom [ [94](#B94-medicines-03-00018)], Hong Kong [ [95](#B95-medicines-03-00018)], and Japan [ [96](#B96-medicines-03-00018)], including the TCM herbal product of Onshido [ [93](#B93-medicines-03-00018)]. An additional 21 Chaso-induced cases of liver injury were reported to the regulatory agency in Japan and not further analyzed [ [93](#B93-medicines-03-00018)]. A cautionary statement of the authors asked for further toxicological analysis to demonstrate a possible hepatotoxicity of N-nitroso-fenfluramine, which was not established toxicologically or clinically before 2003 [ [93](#B93-medicines-03-00018)]. Toxicological evidence of its potential hepatotoxicity has not been brought since 2003, and clinical evidence will be difficult to report due to the removal of this ingredient from the market in 1997. The popular and widely used slimming aid fenfluramine was withdrawn from the market mainly due to cardiac and pulmonary adverse reactions rather than hepatic adverse reactions, which were not reported [ [93](#B93-medicines-03-00018)]. For more details and discussions, see Lu Cha (Camellia sinensis) and Onshido. 5.13. Chi R Yun [97](#B97-medicines-03-00018), [98](#B98-medicines-03-00018), There was intentional and unintentional Chi R Yum overdose in two patients [ [97](#B97-medicines-03-00018)] and acute poisonings in 19 patients, because Breynia officinalis was confused with a similar plant, Securinega suffruticosa, which is not known as hepatotoxin [102](#B102-medicines-03-00018)], with the United frequent country [ [76](#B76-medicines-03-00018), [77](#B77-medicines-03-00018), [78](#B78-medicines-03-00018), [100](#B100-medicines-03-00018), [101](#B101-medicines-03-00018)]. In three cases, hepatotoxicity was described following herbal TCM use, but details concerning the administered herbs were missing [ [76](#B76-medicines-03-00018), [100](#B100-medicines-03-00018), [101](#B101-medicines-03-00018)].

One treatment consisted The third patient with a fatal outcome used a mixture consisting of three cases in two reports [ [76](#B76-medicines-03-00018), [77](#B77-medicines-03-00018)], there is some evidence that either Dictamnus dasycarpus or Paeonia species could be the toxic agent [ [77](#B77-medicines-03-00018)]. Analysis of a herbal remedy taken by another patient with ALF and unsuccessfully treated by LTX confirmed the presence of Dictamnus dasycarpus and supports its causal role [ [78](#B78-medicines-03-00018)]. Supportive evidence was also provided by four Korean patients with acute liver injury by Dictamnus dasycarpus used as a single herb [ [75](#B75-medicines-03-00018)]. [102](#B102-medicines-03-00018)].

Clinical symptoms and laboratory findings rapidly improved following cessation of this herb and supportive care. 5.25. Glycyrrhiza Uralensis 5.26. Ho Shou Wu [105](#B105-medicines-03-00018)]. Hepatotoxicity of Ho Shou Wu was also assumed in a 33-year old woman in Hong Kong with a chronic HBV infection, but comedication also consisted of the hepatotoxic Jue Ming Zi (Cassia obtusifolia tora, Senna) and 10 additional and not further identified herbal products [ [82](#B82-medicines-03-00018)]. 5.27. Huang Qin [106](#B106-medicines-03-00018)]. Liver injury was described in four patients of the United States who used Huang Qin in a dietary supplement, which also contained black catechin (Acacia catechin), glucosamine, [109](#B109-medicines-03-00018)]. Acacia catechu was used as one of several Indian Ayurvedic herbs in a patient with severe liver injury and is thereby a possible offending agent [ [89](#B89-medicines-03-00018)], although the herbal extract of Chinese skullcap is the more likely cause of the reported liver injuries [ [107](#B107-medicines-03-00018), [108](#B108-medicines-03-00018), [109](#B109-medicines-03-00018)]. Another 54-year old woman in the United States experienced liver injury following use of a herbal TCM mixture containing Chinese skullcap and black catechu for two to four weeks prior to admission [ [110](#B110-medicines-03-00018)]. 5.28. Hwang Geun Cho [111](#B111-medicines-03-00018)]. Symptoms disappeared and laboratory values decreased gradually to near normal values following cessation of this herbal TCM and supportive care. 5.29.

Jia Wei Xiao Yao San 5.32. Jiguja [113](#B113-medicines-03-00018)]. Due to a risk of ALF, the child was transferred to another hospital for further evaluation and liver transplantation. References are presented for two other cases in Korea with acute liver injury in adult patients after ingestion of Hovenia dulcis [ [79](#B79-medicines-03-00018), [80](#B80-medicines-03-00018), [113](#B113-medicines-03-00018)], one of the patients required a LTX [ [80](#B80-medicines-03-00018)]. 5.33. Jin Bu Huan [70](#B70-medicines-03-00018)], was reported in 11 patients in the United States [ [70](#B70-medicines-03-00018), [114](#B114-medicines-03-00018), [115](#B115-medicines-03-00018), [116](#B116-medicines-03-00018)] in one patient originating from Canada [ [115](#B115-medicines-03-00018)], and in one patient in Italy [ [117](#B117-medicines-03-00018)]. L-tetrahydropalmitate is the active ingredient of Jin Bu Huan and the suspected causative agent for liver injury. The herbal medication usually contains only Lycopodium serratum and rarely several unrelated herbal species including Corydalis species, Panax ginseng, Pseudo ginseng or two [114](#B114-medicines-03-00018), San However, the initially suspected causal role of Sedum aizoon was obviously incorrect. Sedum aizoon lacks pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), and when applied to animals, HSOS did not occur [ [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018)]. This suggests that another herb containing PAs was likely responsible for the reported cases [ [119](#B119-medicines-03-00018)]. In line with this is another case in Hong Kong with HSOS that initially was ascribed also to Sedum aizoon, but it turned out to have been caused by the herbal TCM Shan Chi (Gynura segetum) [ [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018)]. Sedum aizoon looks like Gynura segetum, but differentiation is possible for botanical experts [ [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018)]. Comparative studies with both herbs provided clear supportive evidence for Gynura segetum as the offending herb of cases of HSOS as compared to Sedum aizoon. Studies showed that in mice Gynura segetum as the PAs containing herb but not Sedum aizoon lacking PAs induces HSOS as confirmed by liver histology examination [ [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018)]. In an earlier experimental study, a model of the hepatic veno-occlusive disease was established by pyrrolizidine alkaloids derived from a herb described erroneously as Sedum aizoon [ [121](#B121-medicines-03-00018)], which again does not contain PAs [ [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018), [122](#B122-medicines-03-00018), [123](#B123-medicines-03-00018)] This suggests that the described experimental model [ [121](#B121-medicines-03-00018)] was due to the action of a herb containing PAs, most likely Gynura segetum [ [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018), [122](#B122-medicines-03-00018), [123](#B123-medicines-03-00018)], rather than to Sedum aizoon. Based on these well founded conclusions, evidence for a hepatotoxic potential of Jing Tian San Qi is lacking. This herbal TCM Sedum aizoon should therefore not further be considered as hepatotoxic herbal TCM. 5.35. Ju San Qi [124](#B124-medicines-03-00018)]. Additional six cases were earlier suspected [ [125](#B125-medicines-03-00018), [126](#B126-medicines-03-00018)], in at least four cases the culprit was the PAs containing herb Heliotropium lasiocarpum rather than Gynura segetum [ [127](#B127-medicines-03-00018)]. Two cases of HSOS were reported in China [ [128](#B128-medicines-03-00018), [129](#B129-medicines-03-00018)] and another one in Hong Kong [ Jue Ming Zi [82](#B82-medicines-03-00018)]. 5.37. Kamishoyosan [92](#B92-medicines-03-00018)]. Kamishoyosan is a herbal mixture described in the case report [ [92](#B92-medicines-03-00018)], or assessed by an additional internet search for a refined botanical description of the herbal components. The identification of the causative agents was difficult, but Scutellaria was definitively excluded as it was not an ingredient of this herbal product [ [105](#B105-medicines-03-00018), [130](#B130-medicines-03-00018)]. Some uncertainty exists around the Mentha species, declared as Mentha herb in the case report [ [92](#B92-medicines-03-00018)] and as mentha (pennyroyal) subsequently [ [130](#B130-medicines-03-00018)]. Based on an internet search to further specify the Mentha species commonly used in arvensis var. piperascens Malinvaud (Japanese field mint) was most probably the main component. 5.38. Kudzu [79](#B79-medicines-03-00018)]. 5.39. Liquorice 5.40. Long Dan Xie Gan Tang [90](#B90-medicines-03-00018)]. This herbal contains A similar increased risk of hepatotoxicity was observed in a group of patients treated with the TCM Xiao Chai Hu Tang, which also contains Bupleurum among other herbs. See also Bupleurum and Xiao Chai Hu Tang. 5.41. Long Dan Xie Gan Wan 5.42. Lu Cha [93](#B93-medicines-03-00018)]. N-nitroso-fenfluramine but not green tea was discussed as the possible but unproven hepatotoxic ingredient for these herbal mixtures, explaining that this case series cannot prove that N-nitroso-fenfluramine is the toxic agent [ [93](#B93-medicines-03-00018)]. Whether Camellia sinesis might have contributed to the observed liver injury is unclear, however. Information on the amounts of green tea in these two products was not provided. At least as extract, Camellia sinensis is a potent weight loss aid with potentially hepatotoxic effects, as thoroughly discussed first in 2004 [ [131](#B131-medicines-03-00018), [132](#B132-medicines-03-00018), [133](#B133-medicines-03-00018)] and in subsequent years as shown green tea as extracts was not yet clearly established in 2003 when the case reports were published the weight loss aids Chaso and Onshido contained green tea and other herbs [ [93](#B93-medicines-03-00018)]. Presumably, green tea was included as extracts in these two products to enhance weight loss, although the extract form was not specifically mentioned by the manufacturers. The producers failed to mention the synthetic adulterant N-nitroso-fenfluramine as an ingredient of the two products to promote weight loss. This adulterant was assessed later on by respective chemical analyses, but evidence for its hepatotoxic property was not presented and asked for by future studies [ [93](#B93-medicines-03-00018)]. The most likely candidate for the liver injury is green tea, if supplied as the hepatotoxic extract. For details, see [139](#B139-medicines-03-00018), [140](#B140-medicines-03-00018), [141](#B141-medicines-03-00018), [180](#B180-medicines-03-00018)]. Overall, more than 100 suspected cases of liver injury by GTE have been published [ [60](#B60-medicines-03-00018), [180](#B180-medicines-03-00018)], while details of other cases are provided by the NIH liver Tox [ [47](#B47-medicines-03-00018)]. 5.43. Ma Huang [74](#B74-medicines-03-00018), [85](#B85-medicines-03-00018), [145](#B145-medicines-03-00018), [146](#B146-medicines-03-00018), [147](#B147-medicines-03-00018), [148](#B148-medicines-03-00018)]. Out of these six cases, one patient received a coadministration of kava and another one of disulfiram, whereas a third one had chronic HBV infection [ [74](#B74-medicines-03-00018)]. Two patients developed ALF [ [74](#B74-medicines-03-00018), [146](#B146-medicines-03-00018)], and one of these required a liver transplant [ [74](#B74-medicines-03-00018)]. Another patient with ALF requiring a LTX was reported in the United Kingdom [ [149](#B149-medicines-03-00018)]. Ma Huang is also one of the ingredients of Pro-Lean\u00ae, a potentially hepatotoxic herbal mixture [ [150](#B150-medicines-03-00018)]. For Ephedra, see also Bofu Tsu Sho San. 5.44. Mao Guo Tian Jie Cai 5.45. Onshido [93](#B93-medicines-03-00018)]. pentaphyllum makino and Raphanus. Outcome was favorable in all patients except for one patient with a fatal clinical course. Chemical product analysis of Onshido showed lack of fenfluramine and heavy metals such as copper, lead, bismuth, cadmium, stibium, stanum, mercury, and chromium, but presence of N-nitroso-fenfluramine as a possible but overall unproven hepatotoxic agent. N-nitroso-fenfluramine was also considered as a possible culprit in additional cases of liver injuries due to various other slimming aids in the United Kingdom [ [94](#B94-medicines-03-00018)], Hong Kong [ [95](#B95-medicines-03-00018)], and Japan concerning the TCM product Chaso [ [93](#B93-medicines-03-00018)]. An additional 135 Onshido-induced cases of hepatotoxicity were reported to the regulatory agency in Japan but not further analyzed [ [93](#B93-medicines-03-00018)]. A possible role of Camellia sinensis for the observed hepatotoxicity of Onshido was not discussed in 2003 [ [93](#B93-medicines-03-00018)], because hepatotoxic properties of Camellia sinensis extracts became only known in 2004 [ [132](#B132-medicines-03-00018), [133](#B133-medicines-03-00018), [134](#B134-medicines-03-00018)]. For additional details and discussions, see Wan [ [81](#B81-medicines-03-00018)], Ho Wu Shou [ [82](#B82-medicines-03-00018), [105](#B105-medicines-03-00018)], Shen Min [ TCM products such as Ho Shou Wu, Shen Min, Shou Wu Pian and Zhi Shou Wu are declared interchangeable regarding their terms [ [150](#B150-medicines-03-00018)]. However, ingredients may vary from product to product, requiring specific and qualifying product names. The mechanism of hepatotoxicity of Polygonum multiflorum [155](#B155-medicines-03-00018), [157](#B157-medicines-03-00018)]; the injury the anthraquinones (such as chrysophanol, emodin and rhein) which are the major ingredients of Polygonum multiflorum [ [150](#B150-medicines-03-00018)]. In a single report, however, the major compound identified in the recovered tablets was a stilbene glycoside, tetrahydroxystilbene-glucopyranoside [ [150](#B150-medicines-03-00018), [152](#B152-medicines-03-00018)]. LTX was necessary in patients in Korea after using Polygonum multiflorum [ [80](#B80-medicines-03-00018)]. A 33-year old woman from Slovakia experienced acute liver injury after use of Polygonum multiflorum for two months [ [160](#B160-medicines-03-00018)]. Several review articles and analyzing reports of case series of suspected liver injury by Polygonum multiflorum were published [ [161](#B161-medicines-03-00018), [162](#B162-medicines-03-00018), [163](#B163-medicines-03-00018), [164](#B164-medicines-03-00018)]. For instance, a CFDA report 24 literature cases of HILI by Polygonum multiflorum and published its results in the Chinese language without proving causality by a liver specific causality assessment method [ [161](#B161-medicines-03-00018)] such as RUCAM [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. Instead, another Chinese study described valid clinical characteristics of HILI by Polygonum multiflorum in 18 cases with \"highly probable\" or \"probable\" causal role of this TCM herb using RUCAM criteria, all alternative infections including hepatitis E virus (HEV) were excluded; this is really a breakthrough study that is highly appreciated and should be used as an example for future studies on suspected HILI by TCM [ [162](#B162-medicines-03-00018)]. Similarly, other studies on liver injury cases confirmed causality for Polygonum multiflorum, based on high RUCAM gradings and results derived from positive reexposure tests [ [60](#B60-medicines-03-00018), [180](#B180-medicines-03-00018)], using published test criteria [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. In another systematic review of case reports and case series, 450 cases of liver injury due to Polygonum multiflorum were analyzed regarding symptoms, outcome, and risk factors, and other criteria; however, reported results were not convincing as causality was not ascertained by any liver specific method [ [163](#B163-medicines-03-00018)] such as RUCAM [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. Finally, causality in 187 cases of suspected liver injury by Polygonum multiflorum was confirmed following assessment using RUCAM [ [164](#B164-medicines-03-00018)]. For details see also Ban Tu Wan, Chinese herbal mixtures, Ho Wu Shou, Shen Min and Shou Wu Pian. 5.48. Qibao Meiran Wan [165](#B165-medicines-03-00018)]. The product are considered, including Pinellia ternate [ [166](#B166-medicines-03-00018)] and other components of Sairei To [ [167](#B167-medicines-03-00018)]. 5.51. Shan Chi [124](#B124-medicines-03-00018)]. One of these patients required a liver transplant. In a 54-year-old woman originating from Hong Kong, HSOS was finally attributed to PAs derived from Gynura segetum rather than to the herbal TCM Jing Tian San Qi (Sedum aizoon) devoid of PAs [ [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018)]. An additional four patients experienced HSOS after Gynura segetum consumption, one with fatal outcome [ [122](#B122-medicines-03-00018)]. In total, at least 51 HSOS cases have been reported until 2011 [ [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018)], and 116 cases until 2012 [ [122](#B122-medicines-03-00018)]. [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018), [122](#B122-medicines-03-00018), [123](#B123-medicines-03-00018)]. The diagnosis was ascertained in the 54-year-old female patient with HSOS by thorough investigations of the patient and in animal studies [ [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018)]. The clinical diagnosis of HSOS was firmly established by meeting the modified Seattle criteria, characterized by hyperbilirubinaemia, hepatomegaly, and weight gain due to fluid accumulation. Liver histology indicated that the diagnosis was HSOS, and pyrrole-protein adducts as well as pyrrole-GSH conjugates were found in the blood and established the diagnosis. Since the ingested herb was unknown, the cultivated herb from the patient's home was collected and authenticated as the TCM herb segetum. Together with the authenticated TCM herb Sedum aizoon cultivated and collected from another Chinese area, various comparative studies in animals have been done. All these studies confirmed that the observed HSOS arose from the consumption of the PA-containing Gynura segetum, an erroneous substitute of the Sedum aizoon, which does not contain PAs and has a similar name [ [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018)]. 5.52. Shen Min [151](#B151-medicines-03-00018)]. The product label for this Shen Min product listed components including plants and vitamins. Polygonum multiflorum is one of the main components of Shen Min, the content is described as Shen Min 12:1 standardized extract (Polygonum multiflorum) 450 mg per serving and as He Shou Wu powder 870 mg per serving, although Polygonum multiflorum was not specified. Other declared components of the used Shen Min product were Vitamin A, Vitamin B6, biotin, niacin, pantothenic Burdock, Cayenne pepper and Piper nigrum. See also Ho Shou Wu, Polygonum multiflorum and Shou Wu Pian. 5.53. Shi Can [168](#B168-medicines-03-00018)]. After cessation of the herb, recovery was complete in all patients. In three of these, unintentional reexposure led to prompt recurrence of the liver injury. Germander was proposed for weight control in the late 1980s in France, leading to a spectacular outbreak of acute liver injury within a year. This initial report [ [168](#B168-medicines-03-00018)] triggered a national inquiry in France leading to the collection of 26 well-documented cases of acute liver injury due to Germander [ [169](#B169-medicines-03-00018)]. Liver injury was mainly mild to moderate, occurring about two months after starting the treatment [ [168](#B168-medicines-03-00018), [169](#B169-medicines-03-00018)]. [170](#B170-medicines-03-00018), [171](#B171-medicines-03-00018)], one with a lethal outcome [ [170](#B170-medicines-03-00018)]. In a few patients, liver damage occurred more insidiously and was detected at the stage of chronic hepatitis and even cirrhosis [ [172](#B172-medicines-03-00018), [173](#B173-medicines-03-00018)], due to long use of six to seven months [ [171](#B171-medicines-03-00018)] or large daily amounts of several liters of herbal tea for two months [ [172](#B172-medicines-03-00018)]. In 12 patients accidentally reexposed to germander, liver injury relapsed within a delay shorter than for the first episode of hepatitis [ [169](#B169-medicines-03-00018)]. None of the cases had been submitted at that time to causality assessment using RUCAM or criteria of positive reexposure tests, as both were not available when the reports were published [ [168](#B168-medicines-03-00018), [169](#B169-medicines-03-00018), [170](#B170-medicines-03-00018), [171](#B171-medicines-03-00018), [172](#B172-medicines-03-00018), [173](#B173-medicines-03-00018)]. There are additional provide informative narratives [ [174](#B174-medicines-03-00018)]. For Teucrium polium, another herbal medicine closely related to Teucrium chamaedrys, rare cases of acute liver injury have been reported including acute liver failure (ALF) requiring liver transplantation (LTX) [ [175](#B175-medicines-03-00018), [176](#B176-medicines-03-00018)]. As a consequence, Germander has been withdrawn from the market of herbal medicine in France. However, since this outbreak, it is still used in some other countries and new cases have been observed in Canada, Belgium and Spain [ [174](#B174-medicines-03-00018)]. 5.54. Shou Wu Pian [155](#B155-medicines-03-00018)]. Subsequently, similar cases related to Shou Wu Pian were reported in Australia [ [156](#B156-medicines-03-00018)], Canada [ [116](#B116-medicines-03-00018)], Italy [ [154](#B154-medicines-03-00018), [157](#B157-medicines-03-00018)], and the Netherlands in a 5-year-old girl [ [152](#B152-medicines-03-00018)], the United States [ [158](#B158-medicines-03-00018)], Japan [ [159](#B159-medicines-03-00018)], and Korea [ [153](#B153-medicines-03-00018)]. Shou Wu Pian is a herbal mixture with a wide variety of ingredients, but details are rarely mentioned [ [150](#B150-medicines-03-00018), [153](#B153-medicines-03-00018), [159](#B159-medicines-03-00018)]. For example, according to the information via the internet, one of the numerous possible compositions This composition varies substantially from the one of Shen Min [ [151](#B151-medicines-03-00018)], which also contains Polygonum multiflorum and is discussed above. See also Ho Shou Wu, Polygonum multiflorum and Shen Min. (from Vinca plant), water melon flavor, and zeaxanthin. After discontinuation of the product use, the outcome was favorable. 5.60. Xiao Chai Hu Tang [178](#B178-medicines-03-00018)]. For 19 Taiwan patients with HBV infection, treatment with Xiao Chai Hu Tang was associated with an increased risk of liver injury [ [90](#B90-medicines-03-00018)], as was for one additional patient of Taiwan following cholecystectomy [ [179](#B179-medicines-03-00018)]. Xiao Chai Hu Tang is a mixture of several contains the same components as the TCM Da Chai Hu Tang (syn. Dai Saiko To, TJ-8), but in different proportions [ [91](#B91-medicines-03-00018), [103](#B103-medicines-03-00018)]. See also Bupleurum, Da Chai Hu Tang and Long Dan Xie Gan Tang. 5.61.

After cessation of this herbal product, there was a complete recovery. 5.64. Zhi Gan Cao 6. Pathogenetic Aspects of Liver Injury TCM [191](#B191-medicines-03-00018)], including China [ [12](#B12-medicines-03-00018), [69](#B69-medicines-03-00018)], a as TCM [ [67](#B67-medicines-03-00018), [68](#B68-medicines-03-00018), [69](#B69-medicines-03-00018)]. 6.2. TCM [140](#B140-medicines-03-00018)]. Therefore, these phytochemicals must undergo enzymatic degradation and disposition following intestinal resorption by processes similar to those known for synthetic drugs, involving bioactivation pathways via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) systems (Phase I), conjugation to other molecules (Phase II), and excretion and transport provided for many TCM herbs [ [194](#B194-medicines-03-00018), [195](#B195-medicines-03-00018)] such as Polygonum multiflorum [ [196](#B196-medicines-03-00018)], Lu Cha [ [140](#B140-medicines-03-00018)], Shi Can (germander) [ [199](#B199-medicines-03-00018), [200](#B200-medicines-03-00018), herbs [ [28](#B28-medicines-03-00018), [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018), [122](#B122-medicines-03-00018), [201](#B201-medicines-03-00018)]. Genetic variation may cause polymorphisms of CYP [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018), [193](#B193-medicines-03-00018)], which has recently been reported also in Chinese patients with acute liver injury by Polygonum multiflorum [ [196](#B196-medicines-03-00018)], who showed a 46.5% higher frequency of CYP1A2*1C allele as compared to 27.9% in the healthy control group. Thus, patients with this mutation may have less CYP1A2 protein, thereby inhibiting degradation of Polygonum multiflorum ingredients and causing accumulation of toxic substances [ [196](#B196-medicines-03-00018)]. [194](#B194-medicines-03-00018)]. Besides the water soluble components, many liposoluble constituents are included in the final herbal TCM preparations and require biotransformation. Lipophilicity of synthetic drugs is under discussion as a risk factor of DILI [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018), [198](#B198-medicines-03-00018), [202](#B202-medicines-03-00018), [203](#B203-medicines-03-00018)] and may have to be evaluated for liver injury by TCM herbs as well. Results of other DILI studies related to extensive metabolism and high daily doses as risk factors of DILI [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018), [204](#B204-medicines-03-00018), [205](#B205-medicines-03-00018), [206](#B206-medicines-03-00018)] could also be of relevance for TCM herbs. For instance, drugs intensively metabolized by the liver have a higher likelihood causing DILI [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018), [205](#B205-medicines-03-00018), [206](#B206-medicines-03-00018)], and drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes were four times as likely to cause DILI [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018), [203](#B203-medicines-03-00018)]. In more detail, drugs metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2C8/CYP2C9, and CYP3A5 were closely associated with an increased risk of DILI [ [203](#B203-medicines-03-00018)]. Drugs given in a high daily dose of >100 mg were nearly five times as likely to cause DILI a lower daily doses [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018), [203](#B203-medicines-03-00018)]. CYPs usually detoxify various chemicals from TCM herbs but some are activated to toxic compounds which may initiate liver injury [ [59](#B59-medicines-03-00018)]. 6.3. Idiosyncratic and Intrinsic Liver Injury from Herbal TCM [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018), [60](#B60-medicines-03-00018)]. Manufacturing and selling of TCM herbs with the potential for intrinsic liver injury is unethical. In countries with strict regulatory surveillance, herbal TCM products that cause such type of liver injury should be withdrawn from the market. Several criteria allow differentiation of the idiosyncratic from the intrinsic liver injury by TCM [ [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018), [60](#B60-medicines-03-00018)]. 6.3.1. Idiosyncratic Type of Liver Injury [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018), [60](#B60-medicines-03-00018)]. Idiosyncrasy explains also many liver injury cases such as by synthetic drugs [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018), [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018), [197](#B197-medicines-03-00018), herbs [ [89](#B89-medicines-03-00018)]. There is little if any information of the various steps which finally lead to idiosyncratic liver injury in the human liver cell. Case classification of idiosyncratic liver injury due to herbal TCM requires the fulfillment of several criteria [ [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018), [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018), [61](#B61-medicines-03-00018)]. In addition to unpredictability, dose independency is another major criterion for idiosyncratic liver injury that is further differentiated by its two subtypes, a metabolic type and an immunologic type, all with specific criteria ( [Figure 3](#medicines-03-00018-f003)). 6.3.2. Type of Liver Injury [Figure 3](#medicines-03-00018-f003)) [ [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018), [60](#B60-medicines-03-00018)]. Intrinsic liver injury is also known for synthetic drugs if used in overdose such as acetaminophen [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018)]. Cases of intrinsic liver injury caused by TCM herbs are well studied due to reproducibility ( [Figure 3](#medicines-03-00018-f003)). [201](#B201-medicines-03-00018)]. injury ( [Figure 3](#medicines-03-00018-f003)), is dose dependent, well described, and reproducible in mice [ [199](#B199-medicines-03-00018), [201](#B201-medicines-03-00018)]. Due to its experimental reproducibility in laboratory animals, the molecular pathogenesis of experimental Germander (Teucrium chamaedrys) hepatotoxicity was studied, and these results are to human Germander hepatotoxicity [ [199](#B199-medicines-03-00018), [201](#B201-medicines-03-00018)]. Neoclerodane to reactive metabolites These of glutathione and cytoskeleton associated protein thiols, form plasma membrane blebs, and cause apoptosis of liver cells [ [129](#B129-medicines-03-00018), [201](#B201-medicines-03-00018)], contributing to liver cell death [ [201](#B201-medicines-03-00018)]. Finally, reactive metabolites can trigger liver injury through an immunoallergic reaction. [90](#B90-medicines-03-00018), [217](#B217-medicines-03-00018)]; using more than 19 g as cumulative dose of Radix bupleuri may increase the risk of liver injury [ [90](#B90-medicines-03-00018)]. This dose dependency was confirmed in laboratory animals and provided insights into some pathogenetic processes [ [217](#B217-medicines-03-00018)]. [218](#B218-medicines-03-00018), [219](#B219-medicines-03-00018)], as shown in many case reports and case series, where this herb was used either alone or as one among other ingredients in herbal mixtures Bai Shi Wan, Bi Ma Zi, He Shou Wu, Ho Shou Wu, Qibao Meiran Wan, or Shen Min. Human liver injury by Polygonum multiflorum is reproducible in laboratory animals and suggests an intrinsic type of injury [ [163](#B163-medicines-03-00018)]. After analysis of the relevant publications, the impression prevails that most cases of human Polygonum multiflorum hepatotoxicity seem to represent the study favored an idiosyncratic type of injury in patients who used the herb alone and not as part of a herbal mixture, but patients who took a herbal mixture containing Polygonum multiflorum were exluded and not evaluated [ [162](#B162-medicines-03-00018)]. Assessing the type of liver injury ( [Figure 3](#medicines-03-00018-f003)) is impeded by confounding variables [ [163](#B163-medicines-03-00018)]. Among these are incorrect reporting [ [163](#B163-medicines-03-00018)], comedication [ [162](#B162-medicines-03-00018)], preexisting infections by viral hepatitis [ [162](#B162-medicines-03-00018)], water or acetone based products [ [162](#B162-medicines-03-00018), [163](#B163-medicines-03-00018), [219](#B219-medicines-03-00018)], and the use of raw or processed Polygonum multiflorum, whereby processing is achieved by boiling of the reddish roots with black beans [ [162](#B162-medicines-03-00018), [163](#B163-medicines-03-00018), [218](#B218-medicines-03-00018)]. Consensus exists that both raw and processed Polygonum multiflorum can cause liver injury in humans [ [165](#B165-medicines-03-00018), [166](#B166-medicines-03-00018)]. For raw Polygonum multiflorum applied to mice, the liver injury of water decocta was considerably more pronounced than that of the acetone extract; meanwhile, the hepatotoxicity of the acetone extract of raw Polygonum multiflorum was much higher as compared to the acetone extract of the processed Polygonum multiflorum [ [218](#B218-medicines-03-00018)]. [163](#B163-medicines-03-00018), [219](#B219-medicines-03-00018)]. With a median time of 30 days, liver injury occurs when the maximum daily dose exceeds 12 g, with an increased cumulative dose as an additional risk factor was not corroborated in a recent study [ [220](#B220-medicines-03-00018)]. Results of experimental hepatotoxicity in animals were equivocal [ [221](#B221-medicines-03-00018), [222](#B222-medicines-03-00018), [223](#B223-medicines-03-00018)]. Chinese green tea is a popular beverage prepared from the leaves of the plant Camellia sinensis, which has been cultivated in China and other Southeast Asian countries since thousands of years [ [224](#B224-medicines-03-00018)]. Contradictory results of liver injury obtained in humans and laboratory animals may be explained by the variability of oral bioavailability of GT catechins. Consumed with a meal, systemic catechin levels in humans are much lower than the effective concentrations determined in in vitro systems; they are enhanced substantially by >3.5-fold when green tea is consumed after an overnight fast [ [225](#B225-medicines-03-00018)]. Therefore, the fasting/fed status is an additional confounding variable to be considered in bioavailability and liver injury evaluation studies of catechins. [140](#B140-medicines-03-00018), [144](#B144-medicines-03-00018), [226](#B226-medicines-03-00018)]. On a quantitative basis, single doses of up to 1.6 grams of green tea extract are well tolerated [ [140](#B140-medicines-03-00018), [144](#B144-medicines-03-00018)]. The maximum tolerated dose in humans is reported to be 9.9 grams per day, a dose equivalent to 24 cups of green tea. The safety and tolerability of long term use of green tea extracts has not been well defined [ [144](#B144-medicines-03-00018)]. Considering the results of the hepatotoxicity cases [ [144](#B144-medicines-03-00018), [227](#B227-medicines-03-00018), [228](#B228-medicines-03-00018)], use of green tea or its extracts commonly ranged from four to 260 weeks [ [139](#B139-medicines-03-00018)]. However, data of cumulative doses of catechins are not available which would allow calculating respective threshold values. [201](#B201-medicines-03-00018), [229](#B229-medicines-03-00018), [230](#B230-medicines-03-00018)], as evidenced Crotalaria species (Bush tea, ( [Table 4](#medicines-03-00018-t004)), causing HSOS as a specific form of liver damage, injuring preferentially the hepatic sinusoidal cells rather than the liver cells. The pathogenesis of liver injury by TCM herbs containing PAs has been studied in detail [ [25](#B25-medicines-03-00018), [28](#B28-medicines-03-00018), [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018), in C-oxidation and preferentially the sinusoidal endothelial cells of the liver and reduce thereby the sinusoidal blood flow [ [28](#B28-medicines-03-00018)]. This explains the typical clinical features of HSOS, caused for instance by Gynura segetum [ [122](#B122-medicines-03-00018)]. However, a conceptional gap is evident due to the incompatibility of the locations between the cells where toxic PA metabolites are generated, namely in the liver parenchymal cell, and the offending target cell, namely the sinusoidal endothelial cells, which became injured. Indeed, little clinical or experimental evidence exists that hepatocytes are more affected than sinusoidal endothelial cells. HSOS due to unsaturated PAs is clearly dose dependent, thereby predictable, and hence preventable. Consequently, every consumer of these herbs containing PAs is at a dose dependent risk of HSOS. Plants containing PAs are among the most abundant poisonous plants affecting not only humans but also livestock and wildlife, with more than 6000 plant species containing PAs and about 3% of the world's flowering plants containing PAs [ [229](#B229-medicines-03-00018)]. Human embryotoxicity by PAs resulting in fetal HSOS has been described in a newborn whose mother drank one cup of a tea containing PAs per day throughout pregnancy [ [229](#B229-medicines-03-00018), [231](#B231-medicines-03-00018)]. In the past, the CMM listed for human use many TCM herbs with toxic PAs [ [230](#B230-medicines-03-00018)]. All herbal TCM preparations, other herbal products as well as herbal drugs destined for human use and to ensure consumer safety must fulfill regulatory limits of PA content, which may be different from one country to the other [ [232](#B232-medicines-03-00018)]. Efficient herbal drugs can be freed from PAs through CO2 extraction [ [233](#B233-medicines-03-00018), [234](#B234-medicines-03-00018), It mainly contains neoclerodane diterpenoids, with a chemical structure similar to that of other furan compounds known to be hepatotoxic. Germander components have been shown to be mainly oxidized by CYP3A into reactive metabolites able to deplete glutathione and cytoskeleton-associated protein thiols and cause plasma membrane blebs. Another example is the liver injury caused by Polygonum multiflorum that is not dependent on the content of anthranoid derivatives as previously suggested but may be correlated with the content of tetrahydroxystilbene glucosides [ [218](#B218-medicines-03-00018)], in support of other studies [ [150](#B150-medicines-03-00018), [152](#B152-medicines-03-00018)]. Finally, Lu Cha (green tea) extracts cause liver injury, but it remains unclear which of their polyphenolic catechins is the causative EGCG found to be cytotoxic in isolated hepatocytes by mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and reactive oxygen species' formation [ [141](#B141-medicines-03-00018), [222](#B222-medicines-03-00018)]. EGCG is also the most abundant catechin in the green tea extracts [ [140](#B140-medicines-03-00018), [141](#B141-medicines-03-00018)]. The earliest Chinese medical classic \"The Inner Canon of Huangdi\"classifies TCM herbs as having high, moderate, or low toxicity, or as being nontoxic; in addition, recent toxicological studies found that some chemical ingredients of the TCM herbs classified as nontoxic can cause liver injury [ [181](#B181-medicines-03-00018)]. Likely in order to reduce toxicity of some TCM herbs, TCM philosophy requires the use of numerous herbal TCM products as mixtures consisting of different herbs, commonly with up to six herbs [ [28](#B28-medicines-03-00018), [185](#B185-medicines-03-00018)] or even more ( [Table 4](#medicines-03-00018-t004)) [ [185](#B185-medicines-03-00018)]. Typically, there is a primary herb, referred to as the \"King\" [ [28](#B28-medicines-03-00018)] or \"Monarch\" [ [67](#B67-medicines-03-00018)] herb as the key ingredient. The other constituents, called also \"Minister\", \"Assistant\", or \"Envoy\" [ [67](#B67-medicines-03-00018)], are believed to function as modifiers of toxicity, which is well recognized but not detailed and not described in terms of specific molecular toxins [ [28](#B28-medicines-03-00018), [67](#B67-medicines-03-00018)]; they are also considered to synergistically increase the King herb effects [ [185](#B185-medicines-03-00018)], to improve the immune function [ [28](#B28-medicines-03-00018)], or strengthen certain aspects of not further described actions [ [28](#B28-medicines-03-00018)]. 7. Key Clinical Features of Liver Injury Due rigorous a method causality assessment, using a method such as RUCAM [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. Due to these uncertainties, clinical features presented below as examples and derived preferentially from case series remain in part tentative. 7.1. Duration of Herbal Use and Time to Onset [236](#B236-medicines-03-00018)]. These data suggest that herb use was stopped some days before symptoms emerged, but causes of herb discontinuation use were not communicated. This early stop is quite unusual as patients commonly stop herbal use after and not before appearance of symptoms [ [236](#B236-medicines-03-00018)]. [181](#B181-medicines-03-00018)]. Indeed, patients of the non HSOS group with liver injury by Polygonum multiflorum showed a median time of symptom onset of 27 days with a range of 1-120 days in one study [ [162](#B162-medicines-03-00018)] or of 30 days with a range of 1-240 days [ [163](#B163-medicines-03-00018)], while latency periods were not assessed in another study which reported instead a mean duration of intake of 169 days with a range from 15 to 730 days [ [164](#B164-medicines-03-00018)]. A short time to onset of one day or few days puts causality in question, as it seems that the patient started the treatment at a time when a liver disease unrelated to any herb or drug emerged, or even worse, the treatment was considered for symptoms that were liver related but not recognized as such. Within the non HSOS group, patients with liver injury caused by the TCM Lu Cha (green tea), who had used this herb as extracts from two days up to more than one year and showed a time to onset in a range from 14 days to more than one year [ [141](#B141-medicines-03-00018)]. In another study of Lu Cha, the liver injury occurred between four days and four years; however, the time to onset was 4 weeks in 25% and 3 months in 70% [ [138](#B138-medicines-03-00018)]. 7.2. Symptoms and Clinical Features [122](#B122-medicines-03-00018)], these clinical signs are not observed in patients with liver injury caused by TCM herbs lacking PAs. Instead, these patients experienced a variety of symptoms such as anorexia (58.0%), fatigue (67.3%), jaundice (60.3%), nausea (35.9%), and fever (35.9%), but signs such as rash, pruritus, and pale colored stools have also been reported [ [181](#B181-medicines-03-00018)], in support of many case reports and case were described in patients with liver injury due to non TCM detail, liver injury by La Chu (green tea) extracts is characterized in 19 patients by the following symptoms: Jaundice (10 cases; and epigastric pain, each in two cases (10.5%), as well as low back pain, hypogastric pain, right upper quadrant pain, diarrhea, asthenia, and weight loss, each in one case (5.3%), whereby each patient had at least one symptom and most multiple symptoms [ [141](#B141-medicines-03-00018)]. However, no information is provided for these 19 patients as to the sequence in which the symptoms emerged [ [141](#B141-medicines-03-00018)], as opposed for instance in a patient with liver injury due to Indian Ayurvedic herbs, who provided the following symptoms in sequence: starting with pruritus, followed by loss of appetite, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, light stool, and finally jaundice [ [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018), [89](#B89-medicines-03-00018)]. With Polygonum multiflorum as another example of liver injury not related to PAs, most of the patients were admitted for jaundice, fatigue, anorexia, and discolored urine, shown in a report of 18 patients [ [162](#B162-medicines-03-00018)], with similar results provided in another publication [ [163](#B163-medicines-03-00018)]. Jaundice was the leading symptom in 20/25 patients (80%) with liver injury due to Polygonum multiflorum, rarely associated with extrahepatic manifestations such as arthralgia, fever, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, eosinophilia, and skin rash [ [153](#B153-medicines-03-00018)]. It appears from these studies that patients with liver injury caused by green tea extracts or Polygonum multiflorum were rarely monosymptomatic but mostly polysymptomatic. Only few patients with liver injury were described as being asymptomatic [ [153](#B153-medicines-03-00018)]. [122](#B122-medicines-03-00018)]. Use of TCM herbs containing PAs may result in splenic measurement at the upper limit of normal as revealed by ultrasonography, but splenomegaly was not observed likely due to short term use of the herbs [ [125](#B125-medicines-03-00018)]. Diagnosis of HSOS was established using the modified Seattle criteria [ [122](#B122-medicines-03-00018), [237](#B237-medicines-03-00018)], and causality was proven by RUCAM. Most importantly, the leading symptom of HSOS caused by Gynura segetum symptom is ascites, which is otherwise rarely found in patients with liver injury by TCM herbs lacking PAs, except perhaps in end stage conditions of liver cirrhosis. Therefore, ascites must alert the physician considering HSOS as a diagnostic option ( [Table 6](#medicines-03-00018-t006)). Ignoring this key findings led to erroneous diagnoses and further harm to the patients, as detailed and discussed in many reports [ [119](#B119-medicines-03-00018), [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018), low AST values of 54 U/L [ [129](#B129-medicines-03-00018)] and 79 U/L [ [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018)], or low ALT values of 42 U/L [ [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018)]. In a larger group of patients with HSOS, ALT was 243 \u00b1 60 U/L and AST 259 \u00b1 63 U/L [ [236](#B236-medicines-03-00018)]. These conditions are challenging and require clinical experience to make an early diagnosis. Such problems are not known for the non HSOS cases of liver injury from most other TCM herbs, because often high LT values are more frequent. For instance, increase in ALT between 195 and 3851 U/L may be caused by green tea extracts [ [141](#B141-medicines-03-00018)] or between 601 and 3120 U/L by Polygonum multiflorum [ [164](#B164-medicines-03-00018)] and within a similar range in another cohort [ [153](#B153-medicines-03-00018)]. [238](#B238-medicines-03-00018)]. 7.4. Severity of Liver Disease and Hy's Law 7.4.1. Liver Adaptation [Table 2](#medicines-03-00018-t002)) [ [13](#B13-medicines-03-00018)]. These mild elevations can be either new or pre-existing, for instance caused by a non-alcoholic or alcoholic fatty liver disease. If the ALT elevations occurred newly and are not accompanied by increased bilirubin values or jaundice, they are of no clinical relevance and should be interpreted as liver adaptation to the biotransformation response of the phytochemicals. However, patients with liver adaptation progress rarely to severe liver injury with ALT 5 N, increases of bilirubin or jaundice, requiring LTs monitoring during the treatment. To be cautious, cessation of herbal TCM use should be mandatory for the patient safety, especially if the indication is unclear and treatment was ineffective. 7.4.2. Severe Liver Injury and Acute Liver Failure [80](#B80-medicines-03-00018)]. Jaundice is one of the cardinal symptoms in liver injury caused by herbal TCM [ [153](#B153-medicines-03-00018)], raising the question as to whether high bilirubin values are risk factors of poor outcome [ [238](#B238-medicines-03-00018)] as in DILI cases [ [198](#B198-medicines-03-00018), [239](#B239-medicines-03-00018)]. ALF is more prevalent in patients with HSOS caused by TCM herbs which contain PAs ( [Table 6](#medicines-03-00018-t006)) [ [122](#B122-medicines-03-00018)], but it can also occur in connection with the use of TCM herbs not containing PAs ( [Table 7](#medicines-03-00018-t007)), as shown also in 87 Korean patients with three fatalities and one liver transplantation [ [238](#B238-medicines-03-00018)]. [239](#B239-medicines-03-00018)]. Patients with signs of ALF (e.g., coagulopathy and encephalopathy) should be transferred to a specialized hepatology unit. Up to now, prognostic markers to predict the outcome and to indicate that a patient may require liver transplantation are not evaluated in liver injury caused by TCM herbs. 7.4.3. Natural Course and Outcome [141](#B141-medicines-03-00018)] as compared to herbs containing PAs ( [Table 6](#medicines-03-00018-t006)) [ [122](#B122-medicines-03-00018)]. However, few patients continue the consumption of TCM herbs despite symptoms, but it is not clear whether this is risky for these patients [ [141](#B141-medicines-03-00018)]. As expected, there are no prospective studies that would evaluate whether continued use of TCM herbs despite symptoms modifies the outcome. Continued use despite symptoms was a significant problem in patients using isoniazid and experiencing liver injury, as the delayed cessation of the antituberculous drug was associated with a high risk of fatality. Among 13 patients with continued INH use for more than seven days, seven patients required a liver transplantation or died [ [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018), [240](#B240-medicines-03-00018)]. Conversely, continued use of Greater Celandine in patients with symptomatic liver injury was not associated with an increased risk. Indeed, five patients with overt symptoms, who continued treatment over a period of up to seven months, had a favorable outcome that was contrary to clinical expectations [ [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018), [215](#B215-medicines-03-00018)]. Despite these differences of outcome depending on the causative product, intake of the herbal TCM products must be stopped when symptoms of liver injury occur, considered this as a precautionary measure [ [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018)]. 8. these publications, the clinical diagnosis of liver injury from herbal TCM in these cases remains often unclear. In fact, all authors claimed having validly established the diagnosis and verified the causality, although in some cases only a possible causality for the used herbal TCM product was suggested or data quality was marginal at best. In their recent article on drug-induced liver injury and the highlights from a review of the 2015 literature, Sarges et al. [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018)] stated that in suspected cases of liver injury, the ability to confidently assign causality to a particular drug, chemical, or herbal agent alone has become increasingly complex. They recommend an exhaustive causality assessment and propose a model on which cases of possible liver injury by drugs and herbs should be based [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018)], referring to published work [ Diagnostic biomarkers follow specific analytical methods and can be determined in fluids such as the blood of the patients, who experience liver injury by TCM herbs. [201](#B201-medicines-03-00018)], and for PA containing herbs, protein adducts and conjugates are of ingredients of the plant and their metabolites provide diagnostic information, whereby only the metabolites are classified as mechanistic biomarkers at the surface of the hepatocytes, these autoantibodies were found in the sera of patients who experienced liver injury after consumption of teas prepared from the TCM Shi Can (Germander) for a long period of time [ [201](#B201-medicines-03-00018)]. These autoantibodies are the diagnostic biomarkers, easily assessable in the serum of patients with such liver injury. The specificity of these biomarkers allows attributing cases of liver injury to the ingestion of Germander, which has been responsible for the liver injury of numerous patients in mice, the various steps leading to these antibodies have successfully been explored [ [199](#B199-medicines-03-00018), [200](#B200-medicines-03-00018), [201](#B201-medicines-03-00018)]. It was early recognized that the chemical composition of Germander comprises furan-containing neoclerodane diterpenoids. These Germander ingredients CYP3A reactive metabolites in the microsomal fraction of the hepatocytes, which corresponds to the endoplasmatic reticulum upon electron microscopy Reactive metabolites likely interact with the microsomal epoxide hydrolase and trigger the formation of the respective autoantibodies, which escape from the liver into the blood. These quantitative determination of pyrrole-protein adducts (PPAs) in the blood of affected patients became feasible. This represents a diagnostic breakthrough and is encouraging, as it facilitates the clinical assessment of patients with liver injury, who may or may not have used TCM herbs containing PAs. Blood PPA concentrations were positive in all 23 patients with HSOS caused by PA-containing TCM herbs [ [236](#B236-medicines-03-00018)]. The sensitivity of the test was 100% and the specificity was 95.8%, while the negative predictive value was 100% and the positive likelihood ratio was 23.81. The blood PPA levels tend to decrease quickly within 40 days and then decreased more slowly until it was undetectable within 300 days, indicating that PA metabolites can remain in the blood for a relatively long period of time names as well as lack of proper plant authentication and diagnostic tools created this confusion. These problems stimulated investigations on a diagnostic biomarker of liver injury caused by PAs and led to the development of the PAA biomarker, which is mechanism-based on the knowledge of the other proteins, forming pyrrole-protein adducts which enter the circulation. It seems that PAAs are generated by microsomal CYPs in the liver parenchymal cells [ [120](#B120-medicines-03-00018), [201](#B201-medicines-03-00018), [229](#B229-medicines-03-00018), [230](#B230-medicines-03-00018)], but it remains unclear why toxicity occurs preferentially at another site, in the hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells rather than in the [243](#B243-medicines-03-00018)]. The functions of hepatic been described [ [245](#B245-medicines-03-00018), [246](#B246-medicines-03-00018), [247](#B247-medicines-03-00018), [248](#B248-medicines-03-00018)], but further studies in laboratory animals may be needed in order to clarify how PAs or PAA intermediates are transferred from the hepatocytes to the sinusoidal endothelial cells. In animals treated with PAs, electron microscopy studies showed disruption of the hepatocyte plasma membrane, associated with an extensive bleb formation at the sinusoidal membrane of the hepatocytes [ [246](#B246-medicines-03-00018)]. This occurs nearby the sinusoidal endothelial cells with their well strong endocytic activity [ [247](#B247-medicines-03-00018)]. There is also evidence that PAs undergo CYP-dependent metabolic activation in the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells [ [248](#B248-medicines-03-00018)], suggesting that the intermediates may be generated in these cells. Whether all these processes occur simultaneously or one by one remains to be established. 8.1.1.3. Metabolomics [164](#B164-medicines-03-00018)]. These analyze in the blood of patients with liver injury likely caused by Polygonum multiflorum for trans-stilbene-2-O--d-glucoside (TSG), and many others. This clarifies whether a patient used this herb or a fraudulent substitute. Analyses were done with a liquid chromatograph coupled with a high-resolution hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-QToF-MS) [ [164](#B164-medicines-03-00018)]. 8.2. Progress in Developing Valid Diagnostic Biomarkers [249](#B249-medicines-03-00018)]. However, approaches may not be extended to idiosyncratic liver injury since its causative intermediates are generated in small amounts in the liver cells and not prone to substantial leakage into the circulation. In addition to the diagnostic biomarkers, there is much interest in other biomarkers not necessarily aiming to confirm the diagnosis of advanced injury but with focus on improving early recognition of liver injury [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018), [250](#B250-medicines-03-00018), [251](#B251-medicines-03-00018), [252](#B252-medicines-03-00018), [253](#B253-medicines-03-00018), [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018), [255](#B255-medicines-03-00018), [256](#B256-medicines-03-00018)]. Many studies of these new biomarkers for DILI were published and discussed, but the question was raised as to whether they really are better and what do they diagnose [ [249](#B249-medicines-03-00018)]. Critical evaluations of these studies are needed [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018), [249](#B249-medicines-03-00018)], also in view of the flood of recent publications, shown by more than 620,000 PubMed quotations and over 40,000 more per year in the last two years [ [249](#B249-medicines-03-00018)]. 8.2.1. Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018)]. With respect to DILI, characterization of genetic susceptibility by demonstration of a strong association between a specific HLA haplotype and the liver injury has been recently made with many drugs, including lumiracoxib, abacavir, and HLA-B*5701 [ [255](#B255-medicines-03-00018)]. Whether HLA genotypes can be used in the future as diagnostic biomarkers, as a parameter for risk factors, or as pathogenetic hallmarks requires further studies. 8.2.2. MicroRNA [257](#B257-medicines-03-00018)]. There is substantial interest in the potential role of these microRNAs for the early recognition of liver injury caused by drugs and TCM herbs in place of aminotransferases which are considered by some as insufficiently sensitive in clinical trials of drug development and insufficiently measured in the blood of patients with liver injury caused by drugs such as acetaminophen (AAP) and may have a positive predictive value in determining the outcome of AAP hepatotoxicity [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018)]. Such biomarkers can also be used in determining the need for liver transplantation in AAP intoxication and were found to have a higher sensitivity and specificity in patients with liver injury, who used AAP and received drug treatment for HIV and tuberculosis [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018), [259](#B259-medicines-03-00018)]. Despite encouraging progress of micoRNA evaluation in liver injury due to drugs, final recommendations for pre-clinical trials and clinical use were considered premature [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018), [249](#B249-medicines-03-00018)]. Specific aspects of circulating microRNA molecules as biomarkers in liver disease were also critically addressed in a recent thorough clinical review [ [253](#B253-medicines-03-00018)] and analyses of experimental liver injury due to TCM Chuan Lian Zi (Melia Toosendan) [ [252](#B252-medicines-03-00018)] or the TCM Huan and AAP [ [260](#B260-medicines-03-00018)]. [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018), [252](#B252-medicines-03-00018), [260](#B260-medicines-03-00018)]. Under these conditions, some details on this subject warrant further considerations. Basically, microRNA circulating in the blood may be found with low levels in healthy individuals and with higher levels in patients with various diseases such as cancer, cell and organ transplantation, coronary heart disease, stroke, sepsis, burns, or confined to specific organs [ [253](#B253-medicines-03-00018)]. Blood microRNAs can be differentiated regarding their organ specificity, thereby allowing for instance quantitative analysis for liver specific subtypes of microRNAs [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018), [249](#B249-medicines-03-00018), [253](#B253-medicines-03-00018), [257](#B257-medicines-03-00018)]. They originate from the injured liver, whereby multiple mechanisms are involved in the release of microRNA from the hepatocyte such as passive processes; e.g, simple leakage [ [253](#B253-medicines-03-00018)]. Following cell death, microRNA can reach the extracellular environment bound and protected by subcellular structures. Among active processes, microRNA release via apoptotic bodies and microvesicles are known. During apoptosis, cellular microRNA is packed into granules and subsequently into apoptotic bodies [ [253](#B253-medicines-03-00018)]. Presently, most microRNA studies dealing with liver injury focused on drugs in both patients and animals, whereas only few reports evaluated liver injury by TCM herbs, as assessed in animals but not in patients. [252](#B252-medicines-03-00018)]. This TCM herb is a known hepatotoxic in humans but poorly described in the English scientific literature [ [82](#B82-medicines-03-00018), [181](#B181-medicines-03-00018), [252](#B252-medicines-03-00018)] and should be classified as a herb causing intrinsic liver injury due to its reproducibility in animals [ [252](#B252-medicines-03-00018)]. These animal studies showed that the TCM Chuan Lian Zi caused changes of eight microRNAs and 1723 messenger RNAs. For the eight differentially expressed microRNAs, their predictive target genes were collected, and further analyses revealed that several cellular functions were affected, such as cellular growth and proliferation, gene expression, and cellular development. [260](#B260-medicines-03-00018)]. It was not studied whether this difference applies also to other drugs or herbs. If it is confirmed, microRNA measurements could be used in patients with liver injury to analyze the cause, synthetic drug versus herb. [261](#B261-medicines-03-00018), [262](#B262-medicines-03-00018), [263](#B263-medicines-03-00018), [264](#B264-medicines-03-00018)]; (4) microRNAs fingerprinting might be able to identify in a patient with liver injury whether a specific drug or herb was responsible; and finally (5) microRNA subtypes could elucidate possible mechanism leading to liver injury. Future studies will have to clarify these microRNA issues, as drawing from published data any definite conclusion on the clinical use of microRNAs would be premature. 9. Diagnostic Challenges 9.1. Minimum Quality Requirements of Herbal are evident for most herbs used in the context of discussed by the Chinese FDA, presenting details of the current status and future perspectives of the pharmacovigilance practice and risk control of TCM drugs in China [ [12](#B12-medicines-03-00018)]. 9.2. Variability of Herbal TCM Product Names, Quality, Misidentifications, Adulterants, and Impurities [12](#B12-medicines-03-00018)]. The vast and diverse land area of China is a large reservoir of TCM herbs, which contributes to the complexity of the herb species, their origins and names, since often the same name is used for different TCM herbs or different names for the same herb. In addition, similar names or abbreviations for different species lead to confusion. This problem is also documented in case narratives presented above. [52](#B52-medicines-03-00018)]. TCM clinical practice also considers the place of origin of the TCM herbs as an important factor; some places are thought to be superior but qualifying criteria were not provided [ [12](#B12-medicines-03-00018)]. [12](#B12-medicines-03-00018)]. Herbal TCM product quality may be influenced by adulterations with synthetic drugs and pollution due to contamination with pesticides, heavy metals, or radioactivity, inadequate processing procedures, storage, solvents, solubilizers, and incorrect preparation of the TCM decoctions that relies on \"the rules of the thumb\" as advised by the prescribers [ [12](#B12-medicines-03-00018)]. [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018)]. It seems that most TCM herbal products meet quality standards. Notably, in one study in Germany, analyses of herbal TCM products showed no quality problems [ [13](#B13-medicines-03-00018)] and in a French report of liver injury induced by Shi Can (germander), analyses showed lack of product contamination by insecticides or [164](#B164-medicines-03-00018)], and other impurities [ [50](#B50-medicines-03-00018), [60](#B60-medicines-03-00018)]. It must be guaranteed that all TCM herbs meet product quality standards, considering the rules of current Good Agricultural Practices (cGAPs) and current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) ( however, suggestions on how data should be captured, presentation including narratives, and evaluation of causality assessment can be improved [ [274](#B274-medicines-03-00018)] and which approaches should be undertaken [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018)]. Most promising is the prospective data acquisition at a time when liver injury is suspected, using the items of the RUCAM and a checklist of differential diagnoses that should be excluded ( [Table 9](#medicines-03-00018-t009)) [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. Although not comprehensive, it is to be used as a guide and in connection with RUCAM [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. AAA, Hepatitis B C virus; SLA, Soluble liver SMA, Smooth muscle stimulating hormone; TTG, Tissue transglutaminase. Liver Injury [Figure 4](#medicines-03-00018-f004)). [Figure 4](#medicines-03-00018-f004)) goes back to when RUCAM was developed in 1993 [ [275](#B275-medicines-03-00018), [276](#B276-medicines-03-00018)] and has remained unchanged except for one criterion which was changed to ALT > 5 N [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. These definitions can be applied to suspected liver injury caused not only by TCM herbs, but also by other herbs and drugs ( [Figure 4](#medicines-03-00018-f004)). Hepatocellular injury prevails in most series [ [164](#B164-medicines-03-00018), [181](#B181-medicines-03-00018), [238](#B238-medicines-03-00018)]. 11. RUCAM as the Preferred Method to Assess Causality in Liver Injury Caused by TCM Herbs [15](#B15-medicines-03-00018)] and based on the original version [ [275](#B275-medicines-03-00018), [276](#B276-medicines-03-00018)]. Assessment requires to determine the type of injury: hepatocellular type or cholestatic or mixed type ( [Figure 3](#medicines-03-00018-f003)) [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. RUCAM represents a structured, standardized, validated, and hepatotoxicity specific diagnostic approach, which attributes scores to key items that reflect the natural course of the liver injury, ALT dechallenge features, and search for alternative causes [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. [15](#B15-medicines-03-00018)]. In short, the key items are assessed in seven domains: (1) the time to onset from the beginning of the herb intake, with specific criteria that are well scored and clearly defined with a time frame between beginning of the herb use with day 0 as the first day of intake and the onset of increased LTs or symptoms; (2) precise dechallenge criteria with scores reflecting the natural course of LTs after cessation of the suspected herb are cornerstones of RUCAM, while treatment during the dechallenge phase with drugs such as steroids or ursodesoxycholic acid may mask the natural course and allows only a score of 0, reflecting no information; (3) risk factors such as current alcohol use and age are to be considered; (4) concomitant use of drugs and herbs is a crucial item, requiring details of a temporal association and potential hepatotoxic features of the used product and a separate evaluation; (5) the search for alternative causes considers the clinically most relevant causes such as infections by HAV, HBV, HCV, HEV, CMV, EBV, HSV, and VZV, to be by parameters such as PCR and IgM/IgG antibody titers also upon repetitive analyses, as well as complications of underlying disease(s); (6) previous hepatotoxicity listed in the product information sheet (e.g., Summary of product characteristics in the EU or product information in the US) must be checked; and finally (7) the response to any unintentional reexposure has to be evaluated, as to whether specific criteria of a positive test result are fulfilled. Items of these seven domains provide individual scores for each suspected TCM herb in a case report, giving a final quantitative [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. However, RUCAM based assessment should not be limited to providing the final score. Instead, for reasons of transparency and reassessment, each item with its score for any TCM herb and concomitant product must be presented [ [274](#B274-medicines-03-00018)], not only to regulatory agencies and the manufacturer but also and more importantly to editors if a publication as a case report or case series is considered. Lacking presentation of individual RUCAM based data would invalidate such publications. [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)] including China where it is applied and recommended [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018), [277](#B277-medicines-03-00018)]. RUCAM has many advantages compared to other methods attempting to assess such causality ( [Table 10](#medicines-03-00018-t010)) [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. RUCAM was also often applied in cases of liver injury caused by TCM method is preferred, which circumvents scoring of individual items and obviates transparency ( [Table 10](#medicines-03-00018-t010)) [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)] as shown also in a recent report of seven cases with suspected liver injury [ [281](#B281-medicines-03-00018)]. In this study, RUCAM causality levels were low with unlikely in one case, possible in four cases, and probable in two cases only; conversely, the DILIN method attributed a probable or higher causality to six cases and a possible causality to one case. Case evaluations were confounded by an undefined reexposure test, several comedications, as 5/7 patients (71.4%) used up to two other prescription medications or herbal dietary supplements, and preexisting chronic HBV infection, which caused liver cirrhosis, requiring a liver transplant. The suggestion that DILI may have superimposed on chronic HBV infection [ [281](#B281-medicines-03-00018)] appears unlikely in view of clinical experience and a previous analysis [ [198](#B198-medicines-03-00018)]. [281](#B281-medicines-03-00018)]. Even more problematic was the approach to exclude HEV, as assessment was confounded by positive anti-HEV IgG titers, incomplete analysis of essential HEV parameters, and not prospective evaluations. HEV-RNA was not at all determined in any of the cases for unknown reasons, and the used HEV antibody assays were not specified [ [281](#B281-medicines-03-00018)], disregarding the well-known problem of lacking FDA approval [ [241](#B241-medicines-03-00018), [242](#B242-medicines-03-00018), [282](#B282-medicines-03-00018)]. For none of these seven patients, product use or purchase was confirmed, nor was a product analysis done. Suggestions how to provide good evaluations of case data were made recently by scientists from the USA [ [192](#B192-medicines-03-00018)]. Their recommendations should be followed in the future. 12. Reexposure [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. Intentional reexposure tests are obsolete due to the high health risk for the patient. Case reports and case series of suspected liver injury caused by various TCM herbs, other herbs and herbal dietary supplements may contain the information that in one or the other patient a positive reexposure test was found. In most reports, however, details of the results were not provided and did not allow a valid conclusion. For instance, among 53 cases with liver injury, a positive reexposure test was reported in eight patients, but the reanalysis of these published reexposure tests with claimed positive results was disappointing, since in only one case out of these eight cases a positive test result could be verified; in another case, the test result was clearly negative, while in the remaining six cases, data were considered as uninterpretable due to missing information to comply adequately with specific criteria [ [287](#B287-medicines-03-00018)]. In these eight cases, causality reassessment with RUCAM revealed causality levels of probable in one case and of unlikely and excluded in four and three cases, respectively [ [287](#B287-medicines-03-00018)]. Therefore, both RUCAM and unintentional reexposure tests are valuable tools to assess causality [ [287](#B287-medicines-03-00018)], while similar and confirmatory results were subsequently published with RUCAM [ [288](#B288-medicines-03-00018)]. [180](#B180-medicines-03-00018)]. For future cases of reported positive reexposure tests, special attention should be paid, as to whether specific criteria were such as those published recently in connection with details of RUCAM [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. To circumvent inappropriate claims that a positive reexposure test could have established causality in liver injury cases, it is of importance to present details of such reexposure. For a positive reexposure test result, several criteria must be fulfilled ( [Table 13](#medicines-03-00018-t013)) [ [51](#B51-medicines-03-00018)]. 13. TCM Herbs with Established, Questionable, or Lacking Liver Injury and Listing Compilation [Table 11](#medicines-03-00018-t011)and [Table 12](#medicines-03-00018-t012)) and provided RUCAM based causality levels, which varied from highly probable to unlikely or excluded RUCAM scores were presented and no case details that precluded subsequent reassessment. Nevertheless, these publications are important as they may give some impression of the tentative number of patients involved and the causality grading. The difficulties to arrive at a valid causality determination in liver injury cases may be illustrated with the example of two TCM herbs, Polygonum multiflorum and [161](#B161-medicines-03-00018), [162](#B162-medicines-03-00018), [163](#B163-medicines-03-00018), [164](#B164-medicines-03-00018)]. The first review of a case series goes back to 2009, when Zhang et al. [ [161](#B161-medicines-03-00018)] reported in a Chinese medical journal on 24 liver injury cases from Polygonum multiflorum, which were retrieved from the scientific literature published between 1978 and 2008 but were not submitted to a regular causality assessment method. In 2015 and again without any use of a causality assessment method, data on 450 patients with suspected liver injury caused by Polygonum multiflorum were reported by Lei et al. [ [163](#B163-medicines-03-00018)]. In these two studies [ [161](#B161-medicines-03-00018), [163](#B163-medicines-03-00018)], clinical features of suspected liver injury from Polygonum multiflorum were carefully analyzed and presented, but in face of a lacking formal causality assessment the obtained data must be considered as vague, unless causality will now be done as expected from the scientific community. [153](#B153-medicines-03-00018)] expanded our knowledge on this topic and provided details of 25 cases with a probable causality in 15 patients and a highly probable causality in 10 patients. RUCAM was also used in two other studies that were published in 2014 [ [162](#B162-medicines-03-00018), [164](#B164-medicines-03-00018)]. Dong et al. [ [162](#B162-medicines-03-00018)] reported the results of 18 patients with liver injury following ingestion of Polygonum multiflorum. Upon RUCAM based causality assessment, 14/18 patients (77.8%) reached a highly probable causality, with four patients (22.2%) who achieved a probable causality level. Such high causality levels are likely due to the strict inclusion criteria which led to exclusion of all patients who were comedicated with any other herb or drug. Primarily excluded were also patients with any virus infection. [67](#B67-medicines-03-00018)] reassessed published cases of liver injury from Polygonum multiflorum and found in only 45/147 cases (30.6%) a highly probable causality by RUCAM criteria, whereas the assessment of 40 own hospitalized cases revealed a figure of 22.5% (9/40 cases). For the hospitalized group, proposals involving pharmacognosy, phytochemistry, and metabolomics tests were made to improve causality levels, but these techniques are not routinely available at other centers. Zhu et al. [ [187](#B187-medicines-03-00018)] also used RUCAM in another study of liver injury caused by Polygonum multiflorum and found that of 158 liver injury patients, who used Polygonum multiflorum preparations, 92 (58.2%) combined with Western medicine or Chinese herbal preparations without Polygonum multiflorum. [137](#B137-medicines-03-00018)], which would have been best solved with the use of a liver specific causality assessment method such as RUCAM. Instead and in line with the disputed approach for another herb namely black cohosh [ [265](#B265-medicines-03-00018), [289](#B289-medicines-03-00018), [290](#B290-medicines-03-00018)], USP again used for the suspected cases of liver injury from GTE the Naranjo method [ [137](#B137-medicines-03-00018)] with its known problematic lack of liver specific characteristics [ [265](#B265-medicines-03-00018), [290](#B290-medicines-03-00018), [291](#B291-medicines-03-00018)], as opposed to the liver specific RUCAM ( [Table 10](#medicines-03-00018-t010)). The USP approach led to uniformly possible causality levels for all evaluated cases [ [137](#B137-medicines-03-00018)]. Such uniformity is unusual and signifies a low discriminating power of the used method. Indeed, the Naranjo scale was considered by Liss and Lewis [ [291](#B291-medicines-03-00018)] as too sensitive, allowing a possible causality even in the absence of essential data or by virtue of the patient simply having taken the suspected agent, and concern has been expressed that a more sophisticated judgment would have been expected from the USP. In a clinical context, such low causality levels are usually of little relevance. [137](#B137-medicines-03-00018)]. However, recognizing the need for consistent evaluation using reliable causality scales, USP adopted as a means of achieving consistency in evaluations and minimizing biases through the use of a validated causality scale. Notably, the Naranjo scale has never been validated for liver injury cases, which should have excluded the use of the Naranjo scale for the USP assessment. Another statement of the USP is not founded, that the facility of the Naranjo scale to accommodate the limitations of missing data was considered a further bonus [ [137](#B137-medicines-03-00018)]. The limitations of the Naranjo scale were summarized recently, which was designed for evaluation of toxic drug reactions and contains questions regarding drug concentrations and monitoring, dose relationship, including decreasing dose, placebo response, cross-reactivity, and confirmation of the adverse drug reaction using unidentified objective evidence [ [290](#B290-medicines-03-00018)]. [138](#B138-medicines-03-00018), [140](#B140-medicines-03-00018), [141](#B141-medicines-03-00018)]. [220](#B220-medicines-03-00018)]. This time frame may be too short to allow a final conclusion since GTE was used partially much longer by patients who experienced liver injury [ [141](#B141-medicines-03-00018)]. As fasting increases the intestinal absorption of GTE catechins [ [140](#B140-medicines-03-00018)], this condition may have prevailed in the clinical cases and could have not been considered appropriately in the GTE study [ is also lack of convincing evidence that the TCM Ba Jiao Lian (Dysosma pleianthum) is hepatotoxic, as assumed previously [ [53](#B53-medicines-03-00018), [73](#B73-medicines-03-00018)] and outlined for this TCM under Narratives above. 14. Chronic Courses and Injury Risk from TCM Herbs for Preexisting Liver Disease [Table 6](#medicines-03-00018-t006)) [ [122](#B122-medicines-03-00018)]. [198](#B198-medicines-03-00018)]. 15. Comparison with Drug Induced Liver Injury [188](#B188-medicines-03-00018)]. In this analysis, 870 patients (43.8%) used Western medicine, 563 patients (28.4%) took TCM herbs, while 552 patients (27.8%) coadministered Western medicine and TCM herbs. Peak ALT values as expressed as means were similar in the Western medicine group as compared to the TCM herb group and did not allow an ALT based differentiation. Prognosis with good outcome was similar in the two groups, with a marginally higher fatality rate in the TCM herb group and a marginally higher transplantation rate in the Western medicine group. The most commonly implicated TCM all of which had a high casualty level as established by RUCAM and were listed under the TCM herbs with confirmed causality ( [Table 4](#medicines-03-00018-t004)). In another article based on data of patients with ALF or acute liver injury in 32 academic centers in the US, the comparison of the severity between DILI and HILI including complementary medicines and dietary supplements showed that the HILI group had a higher rate of transplantation and lower transplant-free survival in those who progressed to ALF [ [293](#B293-medicines-03-00018)]. 16. Outbreaks of Liver Injury from TCM Herbs [294](#B294-medicines-03-00018), [295](#B295-medicines-03-00018), [296](#B296-medicines-03-00018), [297](#B297-medicines-03-00018)]. For example, following a two-year period of severe drought, a very large number of patients with massive ascites and emaciation were observed in northwestern Afghanistan [ [294](#B294-medicines-03-00018)]. Clinico-pathological studies showed that these were typical cases of HSOS. The outbreak was caused by consumption of bread made from wheat contaminated with seeds of Heliotropium plants, which were shown to contain PAs. Examination of 7200 inhabitants from the affected villages showed evidence of liver disease in 22.8%. Clinical improvement was observed in thirteen cases after three to nine months, and in three cases liver biopsies showed almost complete disappearance of initial abnormalities [ [294](#B294-medicines-03-00018)]. A more recent outbreak of HSOS was reported from Western Afghanistan, associated with exposure to wheat flour contaminated with PAs, but the incriminating plant remained unclear [ [295](#B295-medicines-03-00018)]. [296](#B296-medicines-03-00018), [297](#B297-medicines-03-00018)]. One of these was probably caused by consumption of cereals mixed with seeds of a plant (Crotalaria sp.) containing PAs, which occurred in the Sarguja district of India end of 1976; of the 67 recorded cases, 42% died [ [296](#B296-medicines-03-00018)]. The HSOS outbreaks were also highlighted in a recent systematic review article [ [298](#B298-medicines-03-00018)]. 17.

Response to reexposure is positive, if both criteria are met: first, ALTb is below 5 N with N as the upper limit of the normal value, and second, after reexposure, ALT should increase to at least twice the baseline ALT value (ALTr 2 ALTb). Other variations are evaluated as negative or uninterpretable results. For the cholestatic or mixed liver injury, corresponding values of ALP are to be used instead of ALT.
