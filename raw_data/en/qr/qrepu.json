{"title": "Crystal structures reveal that Lewis-x and fucose bind to secondary cholera toxin binding site - in contrast to fucosyl-GM1", "author": "Joel B Heim; Vesna Hodnik; Julie E Heggelund; Gregor Anderluh; Ute Krengel", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/431130v2", "hostname": "biorxiv.org", "description": "Cholera is a life-threatening diarrhoeal disease caused by the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae . Infection occurs after ingestion of the bacteria, which colonize the human small intestine and secrete their major virulence factor - the cholera toxin (CT). Recent studies suggest that the GM1 receptor may not be the only target of the CT, and that fucosylated receptors such as Lewisx (Lex) and histo-blood group antigens may also be important for cellular uptake and toxicity. However, where and how Lex binds to the CT remains unclear. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure (1.5 \u00c5) of the receptor-binding B-subunit of the CT bound to the Lex trisaccharide, and present matching SPR data for CT holotoxins. Lex, and also L-fucose alone (at 500-fold molar excess), bind to the secondary binding site of the toxin, distinct from the GM1 binding site. In contrast, fucosyl-GM1 mainly binds to the primary binding site due to high-affinity interactions of its GM1 core. The two binding sites are likely connected by allosteric cross-talk, potentially affecting toxin uptake. We also discuss why secretors are protected from severe cholera.

However, some individuals experience milder cholera symptoms. These so-called 'secretors', who have blood group antigens also in their bodily fluids like their saliva and the slimy mucus layer covering their stomach and intestines, appear to be somewhat protected.
