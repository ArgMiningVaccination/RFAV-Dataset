Naturopathic medicine is a system of medicine that focuses on restoring the body to its optimal state of health by supporting and strengthening the body's natural healing abilities. What are the fundamental principles of naturopathic medicine? 1. The Healing Power of Nature: Trust in the body's inherent wisdom to heal itself. 2. Identify and Treat the Causes: Look beyond the symptoms to the underlying cause. 3. First, Do No Harm: Utilize the most natural, least invasive and least toxic therapies. 4. Doctor as Teacher: Educate patients in the steps to achieving and maintaining health. 5. Treat the Whole Person: View the body as an integrated whole in all its physical and spiritual dimensions. 6. Prevention: Focus on overall health, wellness and disease prevention. What is a naturopathic doctor? Licensed naturopathic doctors (NDs) are primary health care doctors, graduate of a 4-year accredited naturopathic medical school, trained to use natural methods and when necessary conventional methods in preventing and treating disease. Naturopathic doctors focus on treating the whole person and promoting health. They are trained to conventionally diagnose and treat disease using the most up-to-date laboratory technologies and imaging techniques. They can perform all routine medical exams and minor surgeries in the office, but may also refer patients to medical specialists for more specialized testing or conventional intervention. Are naturopathic doctors licensed? Upon acquiring the degree of Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND) from one of the board accredited schools, naturopathic physicians must pass a national and state level board examination in order to become licensed to practice naturopathic medicine. In order to maintain license, a naturopathic doctor is required to complete at least 30 hours of continuing education every year. Is naturopathic medicine safe? Naturopathic medicines tend to be non-toxic, gentle, and non-invasive treatments. Side effects are rare and NDs are knowledgeable about contraindications between naturopathic remedies and conventional medicines. In addition, NDs are trained to recognize conditions which are outside their scope of practice and refer to other health practitioners when it is appropriate to do so. Are naturopathic doctors opposed to surgery and traditional drug therapies? There are different philosophical points of view on this question. I believe at times surgery and drug therapy are important health care tools to treat a patient and at other times a holistic approach might be the best way to go. For some conditions a co-treatment approach might be the best, for instance, naturopathic co-treatment of cancer patients has helped people manage radiation and chemotherapy side effects. What should I expect at my 1st visit? At your 1st visit, which usually lasts about 1.5 hours, you will have an in depth symptom intake in order to understand the underlying , or external factors that might be contributing to your symptoms and to understand the root cause of your concerns/symptoms. If you have any recent lab work done would be beneficial to bring it along and we might also need to order some lab works, again to understand the underlying causes of your health issues. The more we know where your body stands functionally, the better we can address your health issues. On this visit, you will also have your vital signs checked and have a brief neurological exam performed. In order to use your visit time more efficiently, you may download the forms, fill them up and email or mail them to us before your visit with us. If you have any recent lab works or imaging done, you could send those to us as well. Does my health plan cover naturopathic care? We are network provider for some insurance plans. You may call or email us to check if we are a provider for your plan. You may also check with your insurance provider to determine your coverage. For your convenience, we have a form under \"naturopathic tab\" that tells you what questions you may need to ask your insurance company to determine your coverage. If we are not a provider for your insurance, we will be happy to courtesy bill as an out-of-network provider or we can provide you with the appropriate paper work to submit to your insurance for direct reimbursement. We also accept visa, master card, American express and discover. Care credit is another option for patients who qualify. Flexible spending accounts may also be used to get coverage for your naturopathic services and supplements. As most plans do not roll over, it's best to use your allowance before the end of the year. How do you work with your patients differently than just a regular dentist? Being a dentist and a naturopath when I examine your mouth, besides your teeth and gum condition, I will also get an idea about the health of the rest of your body. Mouth is a mirror to our body; what's going on in our body affects our mouth and vice versa. Therefore when you address what's going on deeper in the body, you will improve the health of your oral tissue as well. Do you use herbs? Yes, when applicable. For example a combination of herbs can make a very good antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory mouth wash. An herb mixture can also make a good wound healing solution. I am afraid of dentist; can you help me with that? Certainly, homeopathy works great for fearful patients and so does flower essence treatment. I don't want my kids to have fluoride, is there an alternative? Yes, cell salts are great alternatives. "}
