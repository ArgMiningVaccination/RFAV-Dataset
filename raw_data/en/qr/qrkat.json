Relative to developed countries and some parts of th e developing world, most notably sub-Saharan Africa, there are far fewer women than men in India and China. It has been argued that as many asa 100 million women could be missing. The possibility of gender bias at birth and the mistreatmentof young girls are widely regarded as key explana tions. We provide a decomposition of these missing women by age and cause of death. While we do not dispute the existence of severe gender bias at youngages, our computations yield some striking new ndings: (1) the vast majority of missing women inIndia and a signicant proportion of those in China are of adult age; (2) as a proportion of the totalfemale population, the number of missing women is largest in sub-Saharan Africa, and the absolutenumbers are comparable to those for India and China; (3) almost all the missing women stem fromdisease-by-disease com parisons and not from the changing co mposition of disease, as described by the epidemiological transition. Finally, using histor ical data, we argue that a comparable proportion of women was missing at the start of the 20th century in the United States, just as they are in India, China, and sub-Saharan Africa today. 1. INTRODUCTION The phrase \"missing women\", coined by Ama rtya Sen (1990, 1992), refers to the observation that in parts of the developing world\u2014notably in India and China\u2014the ratio of women to menis suspiciously low. On average, males outnumbe r females at birth, but that imbalance begins to redress itself soon after. 1The combined effect is (or should be) a roughly equal proportion of men and women in the population as a whole.2That is not the case in large parts of Asia: in India and China, the overall ratio of males to females is around 1.06. By contrast, sub-Saharan Africa appears to d o remarkably well. Sen (1990) observes that this region, \"ravaged as it is by extreme povert y, hunger, and famine, has a substantial excess rather than decit of women\", and conjectures th at the high female participation in the labour force there plays a role in \"linking women's gainful employment and survival prospects\". 1. See, e.g. Coale (1991) and the Regional Model Lif e Tables in Coale, Demeny, and Vaughan (1983). 2. The ratio varies a bit depending on life expectancy an d population growth; see Coale (1991). With \"moderate\" life expectancies of 60 for women and 56.5 for men, and using the West model life tables, the ratio slightly favoursmen (1.022) when population is growing at 2% per year , and women (0.997) in stationary populations. 1262ANDERSON & RAY MISSING WOMEN: AGE AND DISEASE 1263 Much subsequent attention has been placed on a skewed sex ratio at birth, which may indicate sex-selective abortion.3For instance, Zeng et al. (1993) and Das Gupta (2005) observe that sex ratios for higher order births in China ( conditioning on earlier births being female) are signicantly skewed towards males, a clear warn ing sign of sex selection through abortion or infanticide.4A second area of focus is early childhood and the possibility that young girls are systematically less cared for.5It is not that the later-age travails of women are entirely ignored (see, for instance, Dr `eze, 1990; Chen and Dr `eze, 1992; Kochar, 1999), but the accusing nger seems to have been predominantly pointed at the p renatal and infant/early childhood stages. Das Gupta (2005) quite fairly summarizes the literature when she states that \"the evidence indicates that parental preferences overwhelmingly shape the female decit in South and East Asia\". This paper performs an elementary accoun ting exercise. We study how missing women in three different regions\u2014India, China, and sub-Saharan Africa\u2014are distributed across all agegroups (and then by age-disease groups). The methodology we employ is in the spirit of the Sen contribution. For each category\u2014age, and later, age and disease\u2014we posit a \"reference\" death rate for females, one that would be obtained if the death rate of males in that country were to be rescaled by the relative death rates for males and females (in the same category) in developed countries. 6We subtract this reference rate from the actual death rate for females, and then multiply by the population of females in that category. This is the denition of \"missing women\" in the category of interest. Whether it corresponds to some intuitive notion of excess female mortality due to lack of similar care across gender is a complex issue, one that we return to at several points in this paper. We study the distribution of missing women by age and disease, as well as by the aggregate numbers. Our age decomposition yields some striking ndings. First, although the overall sex ratios in India and China are similar\u2014both around 1.06\u2014the two countries have distinct age proles of missing women. A large percentage of the missing women in China are located before birth and in infancy. We estimate tha t around 37-45% of the missing women in China are due to prenatal factors alone. But the numbers for India are more evenly distributed across the different age groups. Prenatal factors account for around 11%, and if we add up all the female decit up to age 15, we do not get to a third of the total. Second, we nd that, as a proportion of the female population the annual flow of missing women is actually largest in sub-Saharan Africa, despite the fact that their overall male to female ratio is less than unity . None of this happens at birth; missing women are spread over the entire age spectrum. When we add up the flow numbers by age for the year 2000, around 1.53 million women are missing in sub-Saharan Africa for that year alone, which is not that different from the Chinese and Indian estimates of 1.73 and 1.71 million, respectively. Expressed as a fraction of the female population, the sub-Saharan numbers are signicantly higher than their Chinese and Indian counterparts. These ndings can be reconciled with the balan ced overall sex ratio in sub-Saharan Africa by the relatively low sex ratio at birth there. In sub-Saharan Africa, the sex ratio at birth is 3. See, e.g. Junhong (2001); Sudha and Rajan (1999); Ebenstein (2007) and Lin et al. (2007). 4. Similarly, Jha et al. (2006) observe that in India, the ratios of males to females for second- and third-order births, conditional on the previous birt hs being female, are extremely high. 5. See, e.g. Deaton (1989); Subramanian and Deaton (1991); Garg and Morduch (1998), and Oster (2009). There is some evidence that excessive female mortality at these younger ages falls most heavily on girls at higher birth orders (see, e.g. Das Gupta, 1987). Gender-based stoppi ng rules may also contribute to differential mortality rates, as girls are likely to be members of larger (and therefore, ceteris paribus , poorer and somewhat more death prone) families. 6. These are the so-called Established Market Economies as dened by the World Bank: Western Europe, Canada, United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1264 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES approximately 1.03, much lower t han for developed countries as a whole (which is 1.06). There appear to be genetic differences that determine this ratio.7 We then turn to decompositions by age and disease. With birth set aside, at younger ages the bulk of missing females come primarily from inf ectious diseases. At older ages, the majority of them can be traced to non-communicable diseases. At the same time, there are systematic differences across the three regions. In India, respiratory and infectious diseases are important sources of excess female deaths, of the same order of magnitude as maternal mo rtality. But two other categories stand out. The main cause (by a long way) of excess female deaths in India is cardiovascular disease. It dominates all other sources of excess female mortality, and easily outstrips missing females atbirth. The second and rather ominous category for excess female deaths in India is \"Injuries\".There are more missing women here, for instan ce, than the total from maternal mortality. In sub-Saharan Africa, much of the female decit is to be found at younger ages. Malaria is an important component, and so is maternal mortality: much more so than in India. But the dominant source of missing women is the human immunodeciency virus /acquired immunode- ciency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). We estimate that there are over 600,000 excess female deaths each year from this source alone. That said, it is still true that the percentage of missing womenin sub-Saharan Africa is comparable to that in India or China even if HIV/AIDS is ignored. For instance, the female decit in cardiovascular disease is also large in sub-Saharan Africa. In China, infectious diseases do not play a large a role. The main female decit is at older ages where non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, are important. A detailed description of these ndings is pos tponed to the main sections of the paper, but one question arises immediately. Is it possible that the difference in mortality rates bygender between developing and developed count ries is simply due to changing compositions of disease? In this case, excess female deaths in developing countries would arise not from lack of \"similar care\" for men and women, but from the changing disease environment. Theepidemiological transition suggests this might be the case. That transition refers to changes in the causal composition of mortality (with developm ent), with infectious diseases giving way to chronic and degenerative ailments as the l eading causes of death. Conventional wisdom states that infectious diseases and undernutritio n do not discriminate across gender, while there is a female advantage in chronic and degenerative disease. Age-by-age calculations that do not control for compositional effects of disease composition might then record a number of\"missing women\", but they would not be missing due to any lack of \"similar care\". Our decomposition allows us to address this issue. Contrary to what we might expect, we nd that the epidemiological transition plays a minimal role. 8Instead, disease-by-disease effects account for an overwhelming fraction of all missing women. In India, the number is1.64 million out of the aggregate estimate of 1.7 1 million, in sub-Saharan Africa 1.39 million out of a total of 1.53 million, and in China 1.59 million out of 1.73 million. These results compel us to confront the question of various ages and various diseases when studying missing women. The aggregate female decit in South and East Asia has been mainly attributed to parental preferences wh ich discriminate against young or unborn girls. Our ndings suggest that excess female mortality is a more universal phenomenon (both over age and over disease). 7. Indeed, the sex ratio at birth for whites in the United States is around 1.06 whereas for blacks it is 1.03. The available data for births from sub-Saharan parents in the United States suggests similar numbers as well. 8. We are using the term \"epidemiological transition\" loosely here. We simply mean the effect of a changing disease mix across countries. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies LimitedANDERSON & RAY MISSING WOMEN: AGE AND DISEASE 1265 We take our methodology to historical data for now-developed countries. We compute the number of missing women in the United S tates in 1900. There is a remarkable congru- ence between these numbers and what we obser ve in the three regions today. Expressed as a proportion of the female population, the number of missing women in the United Statesin 1900 is larger than in India and China today, and slightly smaller than in sub-Saharan Africa. These results raise the spectre of interpreta tion. What constitutes a valid benchmark against which to measure missing women? We use the re lative death rates of males and females in developed countries today, but perhaps there is \"n atural\" variation in such relative rates with development. Our position, on which we expand in Section 6, is that there is little or no reason for such variation and, moreover, that an examin ation of existing data for poor countries cannot settle the issue because we have no separate way to argue that those countries exhibit no gender discrimination. That includes the historical Un ited States; we have no reason to believe that it was discrimination-free. 9 At the same time, our ndings raise questions about just what \"missing women\" means. Section 6 addresses this issue in detail. In our view, an entire gamut of interpretations is possible. For some categories, such as missing women from Injuries, we would argue the dominant cause must be discrimination across g ender. On others, such as missing women from HIV/AIDS, the situation is more complex. There may be lack of similar care in treatment, there may be gender-based violence, and some of the excess may also be due to different cultural and sexual norms. Similarly, in the case of cardiovascular illness, excess female deaths maystem from unequal treatment, but also may be due to differential incidence. Put another way, if we want to restrict ourselves to dening mi ssing women as the number of females who have died due to discrimination, then the original estimates need to be seriously revised downwards . Moreover, such a computation is not at all straightforward. An accounting exercise cannot separate the rol e of direct gender discrimination from other factors\u2014biological, social, environmental, behavioural, or economic\u2014in explaining excess female mortality. But it allows us to ask these que stions, and to assess the comparative impor- tance of each potential category. We may (or may not) already know that the sex ratio at birth is skewed, that there is a female decit from cardiovascular disease, that women die relatively more from injuries in India, that there is maternal mortality, and that HIV/AIDSdisproportionately kills young women in sub-Saha ran Africa. Our decomposition puts all these varied sources into one unied and comparable framework, and it therefore has the potential to inform future research in these areas. 2. COMPUTING MISSING WOMEN 2.1. The Sen counterfactual Sen describes how skewed sex ratios can be tr anslated into absolute numbers of missing women: To get an idea of the numbers of people involve d in the different ratios of women to men, we can estimate the number of \"missing women\" in a country, say, China or India, by calculating the number of extra women who would have been in China or India if thesecountries had the same ratio of women to men as obtains in areas of the world in which 9. Indeed, we cannot be sure about lack of discrimination in anycountry. All we can argue is that the developed countries today set a norm that other countries, includi ng the historical United States, can be measured against. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1266 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES they receive similar care .... In China alone this amounts to 50 million \"missing women\" .... When that number is added to those in South Asia, West Asia, and North Africa, a great many more than 100 million women are \"missing\". These numbers tell us, quietly, a terrible story of inequality and neglect leading to the excess mortality of women. (Sen, 1990) Any computation of missing women presupposes a counterfactual. For Sen, this counterfac- tual is just the overall sex ratio in countries wh ere men and women presumably \"receive similar care\". True, Sen's baseline ratio\u2014the average overall sex ratio for Europe, North America, and Japan\u2014is somewhat optimistic for female survival, including as it does war losses anda different age composition, but the more conserva tive numbers, most notably the alternative calculations by Coale (1991), still yield enormous gures: around 60 million. 10 2.2. Our approach Throughout, we apply variants of the Sen-Coale c ounterfactual, rst to every age group, and then to age/disease groups. Briefly, we suppose (for each age or age-disease category) that the relative death rates of females to males are \"fre e of bias\" in developed countries. We compare these rates with the actual relative rates in the country of interest, and obtain missing women under that category. What we do is no more and no less than a careful accounting exercise. We take the counterfactual seriously and see what it delivers. In particular, we address which age and disease categories house the missing women t hat are identied overall by Sen and Coale. Two points are to be noted, and we return to them in Section 6. First, the choice of any counterfactual, including the one we use, can be challenged. We simply do not know if the \"natural\", \"discrimination-free\" relative d eath rates for women and men are the same in poor and in rich countries. To know this, we mus t somehow assert that some poor regions do nothave discrimination and use the relative death rates for those supposedly discrimination-free regions as benchmarks instead. Such an alternative m ay be useful from the viewpoint of robustness, though far from conclusive. Second, any missing women we do estimate may be \"missing\" for a variety of reasons. We do not suggest that all these numbers must be attributed to, say, discrimination. Indeed, our discussion throughout and especially in Section 6 will explicitly assert that there are several potential channels, all worth exploring in futur e research. Sen's \"terrible story of inequal- ity and neglect\" is possibly true in large part, but other stories may need to be told as well. The fact that there may be excess female deaths at various age groups is well known, and we do not claim to have discovered this.11Our contribution is two-fold. First, we develop a precise decomposition and take it to the data for developing count ries, thereby obtaining a breakdown of missing women by age in India, China, an d sub-Saharan Africa. To our knowledge, these relative numbers by age have never been calcu lated or discussed before. Second, we take exactly the same idea to disease. Once more, it is surely the case that demographers are aware 10. Coale (1991, Table 1) uses the West model life tables to predict the overall sex ratios \"that would exist in the absence of ...discrimination\". This leads to a lower estimate o f missing women compared to Sen's, because\u2014in Coale's words\u2014the actual sex ratio in these countries \"is an inappropriate standard: it is the result of past male warlosses and of an age composition that reflects past low fer tility\", in addition to any absence of discrimination. 11. For instance, Klasen (1998) studies excess femal e mortality in Germany between 1740 and 1860 at two different age groups. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies LimitedANDERSON & RAY MISSING WOMEN: AGE AND DISEASE 1267 of differential gender mortality patterns acr oss causes of death. Yet, we have never seen a unied presentation of the numbers that is comparable across age and disease groups. 2.3. Missing women by age Begin with age-specic computations. Let astand for an age group, where a=1,...,n.T h e extra value a=0 denotes birth. For any age a1, deaths within that group awill refer to all deaths between the ages of a1a n d a.L e t dm(a)a n d dw(a) represent the rate of death of men and women, respectively, at age ain the country or region of interest. Use the label /hatwideto denote these variables for the b enchmark or reference region.12The reference death rate for women of age ain the country of interest is dened by uw(a)=dm(a) /hatwidedm(a)//hatwidedw(a). (1) The number of extra female deaths, and henc e missing women, in the country of interest at ageain a given period is then equal to the differ ence between the actual and reference death rates for women, weighted by the number of women in that age group: mw( a)=/bracketleftbig dw(a)uw(a)/bracketrightbig w(a), (2) where w(a) is the starting population of women of age a. 2.4. Missing women by age and disease We employ an entirely parallel calculation for missing women by age and disease. Consider any age a1, and denote by dm(a,k)a n d dw(a,k) the rates of death of men and women, respectively, from disease kat age ain the country of interest. The reference death rate of women at age afrom disease kin the country of interest is then dened by uw(a,k)=dm(a,k) /hatwidedm(a,k)//hatwidedw(a,k). (3) The number of extra female deaths in the country of interest at age afrom disease kin a given period is therefore equal to mw( a,k)=/bracketleftbig dw(a,k)uw(a,k)/bracketrightbig w(a)( 4 ) where w(a), as before, is the starting population of women of age a.13 2.5. Sex ratios at birth To the estimates in the previous sections we must now add the number of missing women at birth. This necessitates a choice of some \"unbiased\" reference sex ratio at birth, which is an extremely difcult question. Ideally, we want as a comparison point the sex ratio at birth generated by \"the same group in the same circumstances\", minus any differential treatment for boys and girls. Such a refere nce point is not available. 12. We use the group of Established Market Economies a s dened by the World Bank: Western Europe, Canada, United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. 13. In Section 4.1, we modify this approach for cer tain causes of death, such as maternal mortality. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1268 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES TABLE 1 Sex ratios at birth by nationality/ethnicity in the United States Nationality/ethnicity Sex ratio at birth White 1.054 Black 1.030 Sub-Saharan African 1.035 Chinese 1.074 Asian Indian American Indian 1.031 Japanese Hawaiian 1.054 Filipino 1.072 Puerto Rican 1.054 Central and South American 1.044Mexican 1.041 Notes: The data on sex ratios at birth for all race/ethnicities groups (e xcept for Asian Indian and sub-Sa haran African) come from the National Vital Statistics of the Un ited States. The average s reported in the table are a comput ation for the years 1970-2002. They do not vary substantially from just the most recent estimates fo r the year 2002, with the exception of Japanese who have a sex ratio at birth of 1.089 in that year. Data on the sex ratio at births for A sian Indians is not available at the national level before 1992; the estimate in the table is from Abrevaya (2009) for the years 199 2-2004. The numbers for sub-Saha ran African parents come from IPUMS United States, 2000. Coale (1991) used a reference sex ratio at birth of 1.059 for all groups. This is problematic: there is substantial variation in the sex ratio at birth across race and ethnicity. The averagesex ratio at birth for developed countries is in the range of 1.05 to 1.07, with a median equal to 1.059, but this range is non-trivial. Even within Europe, the average in Northern Europe is around 1.05, whereas for the Mediteranean it is in the range of 1.06 to 1.07. More to the point, the sex ratio at birth is signicantly shifted downward for African- American parents (see, e.g. James, 1987), and it is around 1.03. The available evidence suggests that this is also true of sub-Saharan African pare nts in the United States. In contrast, the sex ratios at birth for Asian populations (Asian Indians, Chinese, and Filipinos) in the United States is around 1.07. Table 1 summarizes some of this information. Certainly, there are a number of behavioural, biological, and environmental factors which can explain part of the variation in sex ratios at birth. 14These factors, however, do not explain the racial differences. In the United States, the lower sex ratio at birth for blacks and nativepopulations compared to the white population has been observed for a long time and this large systematic variation found across ethnic/racial groups has persisted. Indeed, the sex ratio at birth for blacks and whites in the United States h as remained relatively constant for at least a century. 15Studies demonstrate that the strong racial effect persists when controlling for other 14. Biological determinants of the sex ratio at birth include the timing of conception and hormonal variations (James, 1987). However, these factors have proved difcult to measure and most research has relied on variableswhich are more easily observable at a large scale such as parental age and birth order. In general, the proportion ofmale births increases with the number of prior births and shor ter birth intervals and it decreases with parental age and the proportion of multiple births. 15. The mean sex ratio at birth between 1915 and 1948 is 1.059 for whites and 1.029 for blacks (McMahan, 1951); between 1942 and 1963, they are 1.057 and 1.023, respectively (Tarver and Lee, 1968); and for 1970-2002,the respective averages are 1.054 and 1.030 (Mathews and Hamilton, 2005). \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies LimitedANDERSON & RAY MISSING WOMEN: AGE AND DISEASE 1269 factors such as parental age, birth order, and parity and these latter effects, in turn, decrease in their importance (Chahnazarian, 1988).16 As for the higher ratios in Asian populations, darker forces may be at work. There is emerging evidence that the Asian Indian, Chinese, and South Korean populations residing in the United States may well be practising gender selection at the prenatal stage, like some of their fellow nationals back home (Almond and Edlund, 2008; Abrevaya, 2009).17How- ever, it is unclear at this stage whether th e phenomenon is pervasive enough to alter the overall estimates. For example, the estimated sex ratio at birth for the Chinese population residing in the United States between 1931 and 1936 is also around 1.07 and this esti- mate certainly predates access to ultrasound tec hniques. Similarly, the average sex ratio at birth among the Filipino population residin g in the United States is in the same range as the other Asian groups. This community has typi cally not been associated with sex-selective practices. It should also be pointed out that a sex ratio at birth of 1.07 is by no means an outlier. It is within the average range in developed count ries, and it is typical of Southern European populations. Nevertheless, despite seemingly syste matic racial differences (particularly between blacks and whites), we should certainly be wary of using the sex ratio at birth of Asian populations residing in developed countries as a reference, and in what follows we use a range of numbers. For India, we use a reference ratio between 1.059 and 1.066. The lower ratio is the average across developed countries and is the one used by Coale (1991), while the higher ratio is the average sex ratio at birth among Asian Indians in the United States (as in Table 1). For sub-Saharan Africa, we use the range 1.030-1 .035. The lower end of the range is the well- documented sex ratio at birth for African-Ame ricans. The upper end is a 2000 estimate using IPUMS data for sub-Saharan Africans in the United States (Table 1).18For China, we use a reference ratio in the range 1.059-1.074. As in the case of India, the lower bound is taken from the average across all developed countri es, while the upper bound is drawn from Chinese populations in the United States (Table 1). Turn now to actual sex ratios at birth in the regions of interest. The most recent estimates of the sex ratio at birth for Indians inIndia range from 1.070 to 1.078.19Those for China are substantially higher. The 2000 census places this ratio at 1.169. The UN Demographic Yearbook reports a lower number for 1989 (1.139). T hese large ratios are to be contrasted with those for sub-Saharan Africa. Using 56 Demogra phic Health and World Fertility Surveys that cover 29 sub-Saharan African countries, and comp aring these with other studies (including 16. Some research has aimed to better understand this racial effect by examining the sex ratio at birth for interracial couples. These studies have concluded it is the father's race which matters. That is, white fathers coupled with either black or American Indian mothers still produced a higher proportion of male births, whereas white mothers did not (Khoury et al., 1984). Similar results were found for Korean fathers who formed interracial unions (Morton et al., 1967). 17. See also Dubuc and Coleman (2007) for evidence from the United Kingdom18. In the light of footnote 20 below, this estimate pr obably needs to be broken up across individuals of Bantu and non-Bantu origin, though we doubt that this will make any difference to the analysis to follow. 19. The data come from the Demographic Health Survey ( DHS, alternatively named the National Family Health Survey). Estimates for the sex ratio at birth include children born between 1980 and 1999. The more recent cohorts have lower sex ratios at birth. Between 1980 and 1990, the estimated ratio is 1.078, and between 1990 and 1999 itis 1.073. According to the most recent DHS (2005-2006), the estimated sex ratio at birth for the year 2000 is 1.070 and the average sex ratio at birth between 1996 and 2006 is 1.074. Both within India and China, there is substantial regional variation in this sex ratio at birth. For example, s ome of the northern states in India have particularly high sex ratios at birth (at least 1.10). But the all-India average is not in this range. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1270 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES birth registration) where available, Gare nne (2002, 2004) places sub-Saharan Africa as a whole at around 1.033. But there is substantial variation within the region.20 To compute missing women at birth, we compare the sex ratios at birth for the same group (Indians, sub-Saharan Africans, Chinese) with our best guess for the appropriate reference ratio. We use a formula analogous to (2) to carry out this computation: mw(0) =/bracketleftbigg(0) /hatwide(0)1/bracketrightbigg w(0) (5) where (0) is the sex ratio at birth in our country, /hatwide(0) the comparison ratio from developed countries, and w(0) is the total number of female births for the very same group. There are surely additional corrections that are possible. For instance, there is some evidence that environmental factors determine the sex ratio at birth.21It is also likely that the sex ratio at birth is affected by development.22But it is unclear whether further ne-tuning would be that useful in the absence of credible information regarding the sex ratio at birth for these groups in developed countries. We therefore stick with th e comparisons that we have. However, it may be useful to note that an additional 0.01 differe nce in the actual and comparison ratios means a difference of approximately 120,000 missing females (per year) in India and 90,000 missing females in China. These numbers are signican tly less than 7% of the total number of missing women that we later estimate for each of these regions. 2.6. Aggregation Our procedure allows us to generate a rst estim ate for missing women, one that controls for age composition as well as group-specic differences in the sex ratio at birth. This estimate,which we call mw A,i sg i v e nb y mw A=n/summationdisplay a=0mw( a). (6) It is important to note that mw Aincludes all changes in the disease composition as we compare across the region of interest and developed count ries. But we can generate a second estimate for missing women that effectively keeps the disease mix unchanged: one that, in effect, controls for both the age composition and the disease mix. This estimate is obtained by simply addingmissing women by age and disease over all ages and mw B=mw(0) +n/summationdisplay a=1/summationdisplay the predominantly Bantu populati ons of Eastern and Southern Africa exhibit sex ratios at birth below 1.000, while Nigeria and Ethiopia display hi gh, Asia-like ratios. Finally, a large group of countries such as Ghana, Mali, and C ote d'Ivoire appear to be around the 1.050 mark. 21. For example, lower proportions of male offsprin g have been observed in populations exposed to dioxin, mercury, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) a nd also parental smoking (MacKenzie, Lockridge and Keith, 2005). Others have connected variations in the sex ratio at birth to wars Myers (1947), seasons (Lerchl, 1998), andlatitude (Navara, 2009). There has been a recent debate on the effect of Hepatitis B on sex ratios (Oster, 2005; Linand Luoh, 2008; Oster et al., 2008) 22. There is evidence that male offspring are more susceptible to death in utero than the female, so maternal malnutrition could be linked to a lower sex ratio at birth (Andersson and Bergstrom, 1998). With better health care, it is to be expected that the sex ratio at birth will rise as more male fetuses survive. Klasen and Wink (2003) attempt to correct for this; some reflection immediately shows that such a correction must increase the number of missing women at birth. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies LimitedANDERSON & RAY MISSING WOMEN: AGE AND DISEASE 1271 The second procedure deliberately makes no attempt to account for any change in the disease mix across the country of interest and the reference country. That leads to the following elementary observation: Observation 1. Assume that in the country of interest, the disease mix is weighted in favour of diseases with relatively equal death rates across gender. Then mw Amw B>0. The opposite inequality would hold if the diseas e mix is weighted in favour of diseases with higher relative male death rates in the country of interest. The observation suggests that, if mw Bis close to mw A, then there is no effect due to the changing composition of disease. We note, how ever, that the converse implication, that if mw Bfalls short of mw A, then there isa compositional effect, has to be regarded more cautiously. The reason is that mw Bis obtained via disease-by-disease aggregation. If some specic disease or disease group is not adequately picked up on the disaggregated data, it will cause mw Bto fall short of mw Aeven if there is no compositional effect. Therefore a positive answer\u2014that disease composition does matter\u2014 is at best indicative and must be supplanted by other evidence. (We will need to address this issue in Section 5.) 3. MISSING WOMEN BY AGE We now provide estimates of missing women via the age decomposition described in Section 2.3and in equation (6). Throughout, we use data from the World Health Organization (WHO) andthe UN Population Division. See Appendi x A for a description of the data. Recall that the overall sex ratios in China and India are similar, around 1.06, while developed countries and sub-Saharan Africa shar e similar sex ratios that are in the region of 0.96-0.98. This is why Sen and others have placed India/China into one grouping, while sub-Saharan Africa occupies a different category a long with the developed regions. Our accounting suggests that a different classication may be in order. 3.1. Death rates by age Table 2 lists (absolute and relative) death rat es of males and females by age group, for India, China, sub-Saharan Africa, and the \"developed reg ions\". Predictably, sub-Saharan Africa has very high death rates overall. The high rates are present across all ages and are particularly high at infancy. India's death rates by age group are (also predictably) higher than China's, and much higher than those f or developed countries. However, of greater interest are the relative death rates by gender. China and the developed countries have a signicantly higher rate of relative mortality for males than do India and sub-Saharan Africa. The discrepancy is particularly noticeable up to middle age. Figure 1 makes this point by graphing the death rate data (shown in boldface in Table 2) for all four regions. Just as in developed regions, male mortality in China exceeds female mortality at all ages, and the excess is quite pronounced up to the early 1930s. We also see the familiar hump through adolescence and the 1920s , with a particular (relative) surfeit of male deaths. The contrast with India and sub-Saharan A frica is remarkable. Young ages display an excess of female deaths , that excess reaching a peak in near-mirror sychronization to the \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1272 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES TABLE 2 Death rates by age, 2000 Developed countries India C hina Sub-Saharan Africa Age Male Female Relative Male Female Relativ e Male Female Relative Male Female Relative <1 6.15 .0 1.21 76.67 6 .2 1.01 31.93 7 .4 0.85 141.5 .9 1.18 1-4 1.25 5.17 0.66 1.72 .0 0.85 12.71 3 .9 0.91 5-9 0.20 .1 1.31 1.72 .5 0.71 0.60 .5 1.19 2.83 .0 0.93 10-14 0.20 .1 1.49 1.31 .5 0.89 0.50 .4 1.49 1.92 .0 0.95 15-19 0.70 .3 2.37 2.02 .4 0.81 1.20 .5 2.44 3.74 .3 0.86 20-24 1.10 .4 2.94 2.63 .3 0.80 1.40 .6 2.25 5.79 .4 0.61 25-29 1.10 .4 2.60 3.23 .2 1.00 1.40 .8 1.65 10.81 4 .8 0.74 30-34 2.20 3.83 1.51 5.23 1.91 .5 18.71 6 .1 1.16 40-44 2.51 .4 1.82 6.64 .6 1.44 2.82 .1 1.34 20.21 4 .6 1.38 45-49 3.92 .1 1.86 9.56 .2 1.55 4.63 .2 1.41 21.71 3 .8 1.57 50-54 5.73 .1 1.84 13.79 .6 1.43 7.55 .0 1.50 23.81 5 .7 1.52 55-59 8.94 .7 1.90 22.21 5 .1 1.47 12.27 .7 26.91 9 .0 60-64 14.07 .2 1.95 31.12 2 .2 1.40 19.71 2 .8 1.55 37.22 6 .5 1.41 65-69 22.61 1 .5 1.96 47.23 8 .4 1.23 31.62 1 .8 1.45 51.63 9 .2 1.32 70-74 36.01 9 .5 1.85 68.96 2 .1 1.11 51.13 9 .0 1.31 76.76 1 .7 1.24 75-79 57.23 4 .0 1.68 99.88 3 .5 1.20 82.66 9 .5 1.19 114.69 4 .9 1.21 80-84 93.76 1 .7 1.52 126.3 114 .0 1.11 133.3 118 .7 1.12 169.8 144 .6 1.17 85-89 150.1 108 .6 1.38 166.5 159 .1 1.05 205.7 191 .3 1.07 245.7 213 .9 1.15 90-94 231.9 182 .5 1.27 228.7 226 .6 1.01 303.3 291 .3 1.04 345.3 307 .3 1.12 95-99 345.8 292 .5 1.18 327.5 329 .7 0.99 427.7 418 .9 1.02 470.3 428 .0 1.10 100+ 501.8 453 .9 1.11 488.3 489 .8 1.00 576.5 568 .8 1.01 616.8 577 .2 1.07 Notes : \"Male\", male death rates, \"Female\", female d eath rates, both per 1000, \"R elative\", Male/Female.

It is only around the mid-30s or later that t hese relative patterns fall into line, with excess male mortality in all regions. Thus the Chinese prole\u2014barring theominously higher sex ratio at birth\u2014is not that different from that of a developed country.In contrast, the Indian and sub-Saharan African proles are similar, at least after birth. Thepairings are very different when one looks at age distributions rather than overall sex ratios. Other data sources echo these ndings. 23 3.2. Missing women We now form an estimate of missing women by age, using equations (2), (5), and (6). Table 2 has much of the central data we need to accomplish this calculation. We augment these withdata on sex ratios at birth, as discussed in Section 2.5. 23. For India, see the National Family Life Survey (2005-2006). For the most recent cohort (born between 2000 and 2006), the relative death rate for ages less than 1 is 1.052; for children aged 1 to 4, it is 0.782. The numberof observations is small though: 1500 to 1700 deaths for each sex at ages 0-1 and 300 to 600 at ages 1-4. Forsub-Saharan Africa, Garenne (2003) examines child mortality rates using 60 DHS surveys. The relative death rate for ages 0 to 4 is 1.10. The UN Demographic Yearbooks provide in formation for ten sub-Saharan African countries, and also conrm the relatively low death rates for ages 15 to 29, for the majority of these countries, including Namibia, Bostwana, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe. This pa ttern stands in stark contrast to that for China and the developed countries. \"Stock\" data on populations reinforce these ndings. C hina and the developed countries have similar proles: sex ratios decline signicantly with age. In contrast, India and sub-Saharan Africa display a relatively flat sex ratio with age. Indeed, India's sex ratios actually increase over the age range 0-35, suggesting not just excess female deaths relative to some developed-country tr endline, but an absolute excess of female deaths. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1274 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES For India, recall that sex ratios at birth lie between 1.070 and 1.078, with an average of 1.074 over the years 1996-2006. If we use the developed-country median (1.059) as a reference, the number of missing females a t birth in India is approximately 184,000 for the year 2000.24 Consider some variations around this estimat e. The high-end birth ratio of 1.078 (along with the same reference) gives us 233,000. On the other hand, if we were to use the average of1.074 and compare it to the actual sex ratio at birth of 1.066 for Indians in the United States,we get around 98,000. Given the mounting evide nce for sex selection in the United States, this is surely on the low side. We feel reasonabl y comfortable with the 184,000 estimate using developed-country reference points. For China, the estimated sex ratio at birth of 1.169 from the 2000 census and a reference sex ratio of 1.059 together yield 885,000 missing females at birth in 2000. 25This may be on the high side if the Chinese census systema tically under-reports female births. The lowest conceivable number is obtained by using the lower UN estimate for China in 1989, which is1.139, and employing the implausibly high refe rence of 1.074, which is the sex ratio at birth for Chinese in the United States, but this still gives us 516,000 missing females. A reasonable compromise may be to use the UN estimates along with the developed-country reference ratio of 1.059, which yields a gure of 644,000. This is probably on the low side, because the UNestimate is for 1989, but we will go with it. There is substantial variation within sub-Saha ran Africa, but Garenne's authoritative review (2002) based on surveys for two-thirds of the re gion leads to an overall average of 1.033. Our reference range lies between 1.030 and 1.035. Faced with these numbers, it is extremely hard to impute any missing females at birth to sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. Perhaps care- ful disaggregation of the region (along with th e corresponding reference ratios) will reveal more nuanced ndings in the future, but this is the best that can be done with the data at present. Table 3 puts these averages together with the es timates of missing females at different ages. Perhaps the most striking implication of the ta ble is that the annual number of missing women in sub-Saharan Africa is comparable to that in India and China, and as a proportion of thetotal female population it is substantially larger. This is in sharp contrast to much of the earlierliterature, which argues that the overall sex r atio in sub-Saharan Africa is low because males and females are treated more equally there. We are not the rst to assert that there are missing women in sub-Saharan Africa. Klasen (1996) 26points out that the sex ratio at birth is low in sub-Saharan Africa, and uses an adjusted aggregate reference ratio. The numbers, howev er, are far lower (relative to India and China) than what we obtain here.27 We uncover these results precisely because we decompose the problem by age groups. (We will get a clearer picture when we decompose by age and disease.) Note that we impute nomissing females at birth to sub-Saharan Africa. The female decit occurs at later ages. 24. To estimate w(0), we use the UN birth rate for India (2000) of 25.8 births per 1000. Given the WHO estimate of total population of 1,049,549,480, this implies t hat there were 27,078,377 births of which 13,018,450 were female. 25. We use the UN estimated birth rate for China in the year 2000 of 14.0 births per 1000 population. Given the WHO estimate of total population of 1,302,307,080, this imp lies that there were 18,232,289 births of which 8,519,761 were female. 26. See also Klasen and Wink (2003, table 3). 27. However, Klasen and Wink estimate stocks while we estimate flows. As the discussion in Section 6.3 below suggests, the Chinese stock of missing women is likely to be much higher t han that for India and sub-Saharan Africa. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies LimitedANDERSON & RAY MISSING WOMEN: AGE AND DISEASE 1275 TABLE 3 Excess female deaths by age (in 000s), 2000 Age group India China ssAfrica At birth 184 644 0 0-1 146 109 32 At birth +0-1 330 753 32 1-4 164 23 1605-9 62 2 4010-14 31 03 0 15-19 77 19 8 20-24 102 7 22225-29 79 18 25830-34 50 24 19535-39 17 26 10340-44 27 23 4745-49 24 33 2450-54 41 28 2555-59 56 29 3560-64 86 53 4365-69 155 100 5770-74 188 150 6275-79 112 185 50 80-84 72 151 30 85-89 32 83 1190-94 9 31 295-99 1 6 0100+ 01 0 Total 1526 % Female population 0.34 0.31 0.47 Sources : United Nations, WHO, and Table 1. Numbers do not sum to total because of rounding error. For India and China, we could have chosen the p lausibly higher numbers of missing females at birth: 233,000 and 885,000, respectively. This modication increases the flow percentage of missing females (relative to the female population) to 0.35 and 0.31 respectively, still way below the corresponding number ( 0.47) for sub-Saharan Africa.28 Table 3 also reveals that, while India and China are quite similar in the overall numbers and percentages of missing women, their distributions across age in the two countries are quite different. Figure 2 summarizes this observation by plotting the percentages of missing women that can be \"attributed\" to different age groups in the three regions. China exhibits a huge spike for missing females at birth: 37% of all missing women in China can be attributed to prenatal factors. That number would be as large as 45% if we used the plausibly larger estimate, and no less than 32% even if we use the implausible lower bound. In contrast, under 11% of the missing fema les in India are prenatal (at most 13% if we use the higher estimate). The cumulative fraction of missing women in India and sub-Saharan Africa does not add up to the Chinese deciency at birth until the age category of the mid-20s 28. Age-specic mortality rates by gender available f or a few sub-Saharan African countries from recent UN Demographic Yearbooks allow us to compute the total num ber of missing women in those countries. We nd that, consistent with the estimates here, the percentage of wome n missing is in the range of 0.35-0.63 for those countries. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1276 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES 05101520253035 0 1 0 2 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0 1 0 0SSAfrica India China Figure 2 Missing women distributed by age (in %) (or the mid-30s, with the larger Chinese estimates). Fully two-thirds of the missing women in India are from an age older than 15. For sub-Sa haran Africa, the proportion of missing women older than 15 is much larger: over 80%.29 This is not to suggest that the emphasis on infanticide and sex-selective abortion in India is unwarranted. There are regions in India whe re such factors play a very important role. The point is that there has been a relative neglect of the older age categories, which account for many more missing women. The story is, however , very different for China and fully supports the greater emphasis on prenatal factors, infancy, and early childhood. 3.3. A remark on pre- versus post-natal mortality The distinction between prenatal and infant mor tality may be fuzzy in practice. Not all of the missing females at birth can be chalked up to prena tal procedures such as sex-selective abortion. It is entirely possible that female infanticide goes unreported. The missing child would stillturn up, but as a missing girl at birth, and not as a post-natal female death. For this reason, an approximate (but useful) measure of missi ng females \"around birth\" may be obtained by summing the rst two rows in Table 3. We therefore report, in the third row of that table,the total of the rst two rows. By this measure, close to 44% of China's missing women arelocated \"around birth\", while the corresponding gure for India is under 20%. (The numberfor sub-Saharan Africa is negligible, around 2%.) 29. The number of missing women in the oldest age groups is signicantly smaller in sub-Saharan Africa relative to India and China. This comes from the fact that life expect ancy is much lower there and hence the relevant population numbers are correspondingly smaller. The fraction of women at older ages who are \"missing\" is quite similar to those in China and India. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies LimitedANDERSON & RAY MISSING WOMEN: AGE AND DISEASE 1277 TABLE 4 Excess female deaths in sub-Saharan Africa with two reference groups (in 000s), 2000 Age group RefGroup =Developed RefGroup =Afr-Americans At 3910-14 9 A) 1521 1337 % Female population 0.47 0.41 Sources : United Nations, WHO, Vital Sta tistics of the United States, and Table 1. Number s do not sum to total because of rounding error. 3.4. A remark on the procedure followed for sub-Saharan Africa The gures we report for India and China use a reference sex ratio at birth of 1.059, which corresponds to the developed-country median. I n contrast, for sub-Saharan Africa, we use African ethnicities residing in developed countries to construct a lower reference sex ratio at birth of 1.033. There is a potential inconsiste ncy here for sub-Saharan Africa: after all, our reference death rates do not incorporate variations by ethnicity.30Instead, our reference group\u2014as far as deaths are concerned\u2014is a representative sample of all races residing in thedifferent regions of the developed world. We just do not have mortality data for all of the developed regions disaggregated by race. Even if we did, we could not be sure that gender variations here are due to biologyand not discrimination or culture. The proces s leading to a death is complex, and we lack the controls to understand this. But the process leadin g to birth is (relatively) simpler, and biological differences stand out better. Of course, it is logically possible that African-Americans in the United States have a lower sex ratio at birth becau se (for instance) they practice sex-selective abortion against males! We would all agree, how ever, that this argument would be intuitively absurd. Thus allowing for reference differences at birth while shutting them off at death is notnecessarily an inconsistent exercise. Nevertheless, and in the interests of full s ymmetry, one can use age-specic mortality rates of African-Americans residing in the Un ited States to compute missing women by age in sub-Saharan Africa. Table 4 records the ndi ngs. This alternative benchmark reduces the 30. We are grateful to an anonymous referee for raising this point. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1278 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES total number of missing women in sub-Saha ran Africa by 12%, and the percentage of the female population which is missing in sub-Sa haran Africa drops by 0.06 points. However, all of our main results still hold. That is, the percentage of the female population missingin sub-Sahara Africa (0.41%) is still much larger than in China or India (0.31 and 0.34%,respectively). The distribution of missing women across the different age groups also remainsquite similar. 31 4. MISSING WOMEN BY DISEASE We have seen that missing women are present in a variety of age categories in India andsub-Saharan Africa, while such dispersion i s far less pronounced for China. We now take a closer look by accounting for missing women over age and disease groups. The WHO divides the causes of death into three categories: (1) communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional diseases; (2) non-comm unicable diseases; and (3) injuries. Infectious disease as well as nutritional and reproductive ailments\u2014the Group 1 diseases\u2014predominatein higher mortality populations. These are replaced by chronic and degenerative diseases (Group 2) in low-mortality populations, such as cardiovascular ailments or cancer. 32This change in mortality patterns, with chronic and degene rative disease replacing acute infectious and deciency diseases as the leading causes of death, is referred to as the epidemiological transition (Omran, 1971).33It is easy to see the transition in the data across our three regions of interest; see Supporting Information to this paper for a discussion. Below, we provide a detailed description of missing women by age and disease category for India, sub-Saharan Africa and China. In light of the epidemiological transition, we alsoexamine the possibility that a divergence in s ex ratios between developing and developed countries is simply due to changing compositions of disease. If true, such excess deaths would arise not from lack of \"similar care\" for men and women but from the changing nature ofthe disease environment. There is a prima facie case for such an argument, simply because Group 1 diseases might discriminate less betw een males and females, while there may be intrinsic female advantages in surviving Group 2 disease (see Supporting Information for morediscussion). This possibility might account for some of the \"missing\" women. We use data from the Global Burden of Diseas e (GBD) study, initiated in 1992, which is a major collaborative effort between the Harvard School of Public Health, the WHO, and theWorld Bank. 34The GBD study used numerous data sources and epidemiological models to estimate the rst comprehensive worldwide cause-of-death patterns in 14 age-sex groups forover 130 important diseases. The estimates reflect all of the information currently available to the WHO. Appendix A describes this dataset in more detail, and points out some of itslimitations. 31. It is important to emphasize that relative to developed regions, 0.08% of the black female population in the United States is also missing. It is this estimate that e xactly explains the overall decline in missing women in sub-Saharan Africa with this alternative benchmark. There fore, to argue that blacks in the United States form a better reference group, we have to be certain that the reasons for \"missing\" black women in the United States (relativeto developed regions) stem entirely from biological di fferences and not from the possibility that black women in the United States suffer more discrimination than their white counterparts in developed countries. Likely, it is acombination of these two factors (and perhaps others) w hich explain missing black women in the United States. 32. In contrast, deaths from injury tend to be the most va riable across countries, as well as across communities within countries. War deaths represent a typical source of variation. 33. The implicit linearity in this denition is overly simplistic : several infectious diseas es, such as tuberculosis, can certainly make a reappearance at \"advanced\" stages of economic development, along with entirely new infectious diseases, such as AIDS. 34. Refer to Mathers et al. (2004) for details. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies LimitedANDERSON & RAY MISSING WOMEN: AGE AND DISEASE 1279 4.1. Special methodological considerations Recall (3) from Section 2, which yields a \"refere nce\" death rate for women by age and disease: uw(a,k)=dm(a,k) /hatwidedm(a,k)//hatwidedw(a,k),( 8 ) and the corresponding expression for excess female deaths by age and disease: mw( a,k)=/bracketleftbig dw(a,k)uw(a,k)/bracketrightbig w(a), where w(a) is the starting population of women of age a. If we simply add these numbers up, we obtain an estimate for missing women that excludes compositional effects due to the epidemiological transition (refer to Sec tion 2.6 mw B=n/summationdisplay a=1/summationdisplay kmw( a,k)+mw(0) . There are some exceptions to this approach. The most signicant of these is maternal mortality, for which a male death rate is not de ned, so equation (8) is invalid. We therefore construct the reference death rate for matern al mortality in each age group by using the ratio of maternal to overall female mortality in each age group in the reference region, and then scaling this by age-specic female mort ality for the country in question. That is, uw(a,m m ) =/hatwidedw(a, mm) /hatwidedw(a)dw(a), (9) where the index k=mm stands for maternal mortality. Maternal mortality is very low in developed regions, so that this procedure will treat practically all maternal deaths as excessfemale deaths, which is as it should be. A second set of exceptions concerns diseases for which relative death rates for devel- oped countries by age are unreliable, because there are so few deaths. Yet those diseases arewidespread in the country of interest. Particularly important examples are malaria, childhoodcluster diseases (such as measles), dia rrhoeal diseases, and tuberculosis. 35Small changes in the developed-country numbers can cause large swings in our estimates.36We therefore use theoverall death rates from all infectious diseases (excluding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)) by age group in de veloped regions to compute our reference rates.37 We have a similar problem for deaths from nutritional causes, HIV/AIDS, and other STDs in the youngest age group, where the death rates from these diseases in the developed regionsare close to zero. In these cases, we have nothing to base our estimates on and simply use areference death ratio of 1:1 as a benchmark. 38 35. We consider all such categories for which there ar e at least 2000 female deaths in our country of interest. 36. For malaria, the total number of deaths over all ages and over alldeveloped regions was less than 100 in the year 2000. A similar observation is true of childhood cluster diseases. For diarrhoeal diseases and tuberculosis,the situation is somewhat different: there are a substantia l number of deaths recorded in developed regions for these two categories of disease, but these primarily occurred at ages 60 or older. Yet in less developed regions, youngerage categories account for a large number of deaths from these diseases, particularily in the case of diarrhoeal deaths.We therefore cannot form reliable reference ratios from developed regions in the younger age categories in this case. 37. For a given disease-age category, we consider fewer t han 100 female deaths in developed regions to be too small to form reliable reference death ratios. 38. Alternatively, following the same strategy as above, w e could have instead used the overall death rates from all communicable diseases within each age group in devel oped countries to compute our reference death ratios. This exercise does not alter our estimates substantially. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1280 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES Ideally, medical data could yield reference m ortality rates by gender for those diseases for which developed-country data is sparse. However, t here is an implicit circularity here: to trust the medical estimates, which are often obtained in developing countries, one must believe, a priori , that there is no gender bias in those countries to begin with. We leave these interesting issues as possible topics of future research. 4.2. General observations We report our estimates in Tables 5 (India), 6 (sub-Saharan Africa), and 7 (China). In each table, the main headings are Groups 1 and 2 diseases, and Injuries. The numbers in bold, alongthe corresponding rows, report missing women b y age. In a world with accurate data (including reliable reference death rates) for every conceiva ble disease, these group sub-aggregates would be built by adding up all missing females from t he diseases in that group. Here, they are not. For instance, the Group 1 estimates are found by treating all Group 1 diseases as a single TABLE 5 Excess female deaths by age and disease (in 000s); India, 2000 60-69 70-79 80 + 1.

The same is true of Group 2 diseases and Injuries.39 However, the total, reported as mw Bon the penultimate line of each table, is deliberately obtained by simply summing over these three categories. If we did not do this, and treated all diseases as one composite ailment, we would be entirely unable to separate out the influence of a change in the disease composition. By forcin g ourselves to add over these categories, we freeze the disease composition to that in the country of interest, and therefore pick up the\"within-disease\" component of missing women. The epidemiological transition is located in the difference mw Amw B, as Observation 1 makes clear. 4.3. India Table 5 summarizes our results for India. The very last line recalls our earlier estimates for missing women by age (mw A). The penultimate line records mw B, as discussed above, pro- viding estimates for every age category as well as a total, obtained by adding in the estimate for missing girls at birth. The correspondence between the two rows is remarkable. Recall that mw Bdeliberately eliminates the effect of the cha nging composition of disease across developed and developing countries, while mw Aincludes all changes in disease composition. Yet there is little difference between the two sets of totals at most ages, and the two grand totals mw Aand mw Bpractically agree. By Observation 1, we must conclude that few, if any, of the missing women in India can be attributed to the epidemiological transition. Several additional observations are of interes t. First, it is evident that the bulk of missing females at younger ages come from Group 1 d iseases. Group 1 disease accounts for fully 260,000 missing females between the ages of 0 an d 4, which is over 15% of the total. Of these, about half is due to infectious disease, while the remainder may be attributed to respiratoryand perinatal ailments. To provide some idea of how big this number is, consider maternal mortality in India, which is widely acknowle dged to be a serious issue (see, e.g. Ronsmans and Graham, 2006). Maternal deaths account for about 130,000 excess female deaths, no smallnumber, but of the same magnitude as excess female deaths caused by infectious and parasitic diseases within the age 0-4 category alone . As we have already seen, much of the Indian discrepancy is to be found at older ages. That excess is certainly reflected in Table 5. At these ages, the excess burden falls mainly on non-communicable Group 2 diseases. Cardiovascular disease is particularly implicated. Women die at a rate closer to men from cardiovascular disease relative to developed countries. 40Our estimates suggest that the number of excess fem ale deaths from cardiovascular sources in the age category 60-69 alone signicantly exceeds all the excess female deaths due to maternalmortality. Moreover, the same number is repeated in the 70-79 age category. The plight of older women in the Indian subcontinent, especially of widows, has received some attention in the literature (see, e.g. Dr `eze, 1990; Chen and Dr `eze, 1992; Kochar, 1999). Table 5 is fully supportive of this emphasis. One rather sinister observation is that the num ber of excess female deaths from \"Injuries\" is high in India. There are excess female deaths under this heading in allgroups. Excess female deaths for women from \"Injuries\" e xceed 225,000, a number that dwarfs maternal 39. Still, it should be noted that despite the incompleten ess of the data, the numbers obtained by summing across the diseases in each sub-category are, in fact, notthat far from the group aggregates that we do use. For instance, add items Athrough Ein Group 1 for India and compare it to the Group 1 aggregates for every age group. 40. For example, the death rates from cardiovascular di sease for the age group 70-79 for males and females in India are 26.17 and 22.20, respectively; the correspondi ng numbers in developed countries are 15.43 and 9.29. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1284 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES mortality. The category 15-29 stands out in this regard, where the number of excess female deaths from \"Injuries\" outpaces excess deaths fro m maternal mortality at the same age. Further decomposition of \"Injuries\" into \"unintentional\" (accidents, etc.) and \"intentional\" (resultingessentially from acts of violence) tells us that around 30,000 extra women die per year, of \"intentional injuries\", or reported violence, in the 15-29 age category alone. These are large and disturbing numbers. Two other factors that point at violence, this time possibly at female infanticide, are the large number of excess deaths under perinatal and congenital conditions. The former accountsfor 38,000 excess female deaths and the latter for over 13,000; again, these are large numbers, comparable to excess deaths from \"intentional injuries\" in the 15-29 age category. 4.4. Sub-Saharan Africa Table 6 reports estimates for sub-Saharan Africa. As in the case of India, we begin with a comparison of the penultimate row, which a dds up excess female mortality over the three groups of disease, with the very last row, which records overall excess deaths by age with no thought given to particular disease groups. The difference, as before, proxies the effect of achange in disease composition across the thre e main groups. Once again, the correspondence between the two sets of numbers is quite strong, an d in particular there is no evidence that the epidemiological transition per se accounts for too many missing women. Overall, the transition appears to account for under 10% of the total. The majority of excess female deaths in sub-Saharan Africa fall into the age groups 0-4, 15-29, and 30-44, with a particularly large number in 15-29. The number of missing girls inthe youngest age group (equal to 275,000) is compar able to those missing in India of that age (320,000). As in India, diarrhoeal and vaccine-p reventible childhood cluster diseases account for a signicant number of missing girls in sub-Saharan Africa, but unlike in other regions,malaria is the principal cause of excess female mortality in the age group 0-4. Each year closeto 140,000 young girls are missing from this disease alone. However, by far the overwhelming single cause of excess female mortality is HIV/AIDS. It accounts for over 600,000 excess female deaths, largely in the 15-44 age category. This cat-egory is also of special interest because it ra ises philosophical questions about the benchmark used to measure missing women. Are these 600,000 excess deaths due to \"discrimination\", violence, or different cultural norms regarding s exuality? For instance, the heterosexual trans- mission of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa (in c ontrast to several developed countries) and the resulting discrepancy in relative death rates acros s gender surely account for these excess female deaths. But what lies behind this difference? Sec tion 6 visits this question of interpretation, but the fact is that we do not know the exact channel. What we do draws attention to it in a way thatpermits comparison with other age-disease g roups. HIV/AIDS is a category\u2014one that accounts for an enormous number of deaths\u2014that differe ntially affects women in sub-Saharan Africa. Ours is a rst estimate of just how large that diffe rential might be, relative to other categories. At the same time, it is important not to underestimate excess female mortality from other causes. If we remove the HIV/AIDS numbers entir ely from the sub-Saharan African total, that still leaves us with over 900,000 missing women, which is 0.28% of the female population.This is entirely comparable with the overall pe rcentages for India (0.31) and China (0.34). As in the case of India, we see that at younger ages, Group 1 diseases play a major role in accounting for missing females, while at older age s Group 2 diseases predominate. The cardio- vascular disadvantage for women makes its presence felt, just as it does in India, though therelative contribution of maternal mortality\u2014and certainly HIV/AIDS\u2014is signicantly higherfor sub-Saharan Africa. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies LimitedANDERSON & RAY MISSING WOMEN: AGE AND DISEASE 1285 It is important to reiterate that the important causes of death are not necessarily the important repositiories of excess female death. Respiratory, perinatal, congenital, and nutritional deaths are important in sub-Saharan Africa, but we do not see an obvious female bias in these deaths. Recall that India, in contrast, displayed a suspi ciously large number for excess female mortality under the perinatal and congenital head ings, as well as under \"Injuries\". 4.5. China Table 7 reports analogous estimates for China. As we have seen before, China is different from both sub-Saharan Africa and India. It has a sim ilar number of missing women, but the bulk of them\u2014around 37% and plausibly more, up to 45%\u2014are to be found at birth. Thereafter, thehighest numbers occur for the lowest age group (0-4) and then for the three oldest age groups (60 and older). Maternal mortality is not a serious issue. Excess female child mortality is due mainly to Group 1 diseases; particularly those cla ssied under \"respiratory\" and \"perinatal\". The disquiet raised by these numbers is not un like that felt when examining the Indian case under the \"perinatal\" or \"congenital\" headings. For the older ages, Group 2 diseases explain the excess female deaths. The main causes are cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Once again, the excess female deaths occur in China because women die at a rate closer to that of men from these diseases relative to developedcountries. Overall, the percentage of missing women due to non-communicable diseases is similar for India and China, though the composition by disease is distinct. In India, there are excess female deaths due to cancer, and in China there are far more women dying fromrespiratory diseases. Maternal conditions play a role in explaining the number of missingwomen in both India and sub-Saharan Africa but not in China. Finally, as far as \"Injuries\" are concerned, the situation seems to lie further away from sub-Saharan Africa and closer to India, wher e \"Injuries\" form a large component of excess female deaths. There are certainly excess female deaths in China under this category. As inIndia, there are also missing women from \"inten tional\" injuries caused by deliberate acts of violence: the 30-44 and 45-59 categories appear to be particularly hard hit. As in the case of India and sub-Saharan Africa, disease composition seems to have little to do with excess female mortality in China. In the two major age groups with (post-natal) missing females, there appears to be little or no composition effect. In the age category 0-4, the effect is, if anything, reversed: the changing composition of disease is associated with higherexcess female mortality. There is a denite effect in the 60-69 age category, where disease-by-disease comparisons account for a little over two -thirds of the missing women. Otherwise, the epidemiological transition does not appear to account for many missing females. Certainly, if we go by the overall numbers, the trans ition explains under 8% of all missing women in China. 5. A HISTORICAL EXCURSION: THE UNITED STATES IN 1900 Barring the limitations of data, there is no r eason why the approach in this paper cannot be applied to the historical experience of now-developed countries. In this section, we show howthis can be done for the United States in 1900. The prole of age-specic relative death rates supports the contention that males and females died far more equally in 1900 in the U nited States than they do now. By the same criterion applied to developing countries toda y, women were at a relative disadvantage then. Figure 3 illustrates. The upper curve plots the male -to-female relative death rates in the devel- oped regions today; it is exactly the same curve as in Figure 1. The lower curve depicts \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1286 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES 0.81.01.21.41.61.82.02.22.42.62.8 1 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0 EME US 1900 Figure 3 Male-female death ratios by age for developed regions and the United States in 1900 Source: UN, WHO, Historical Vital Statistics of the United States. the same prole for the United States in 1900. As far as relative death rates by age in the United States in 1900 go, the latter then looke d much like sub-Saharan Africa and India look today. The data that go into Figure 3 allow us to quickly form estimates of missing women by age in the United States in 1900. We do so in Table 8, which recalls the three developing regionsas well for easy comparison. The table is best read by mentally scaling up the US columnby a factor of 10, which puts the relative num bers on par with sub-Saharan Africa. This is because the female population in 1900 in the United States was around 37 million, while thecorresponding number for sub-Saha ran Africa is around 350 million. 41Note, too, that the sex ratios at birth for different race/ethnic groups in the United States have not signicantly altered between 1900 and 2000, therefore we record zero missing women at birth.42 Nevertheless, substantial numbers of wo men were indeed missing in 1900 in the United States. As a proportion of the female population, the total for 1900 in the United States isactually larger than in India or China today. What is more, with the exception of the youngestage group (0-4), the pattern of missing women i n the United States in 1900 is quite similar to that of India and sub-Saharan Africa today (exam ine the table with the mental scaling of 10). We now estimate missing women by disease. We rely on the Historical Census Reports from the Vital Statistics department of the United S tates. There are some differences between the way this data is presented and the counterpart ta bles for now-developing regions (Tables 5- 7). We have attempted to adhere to the GBD classi cation used in the earlier tables, but the clas- sication of disease in 1900 was different. Some of this is for obvious reasons: the HIV/AIDSvirus was completely absent and others like tube rculosis and meningitis were signicantly more 41. A scaling of roughly 15 would put the numbers on par with India, and of around 20 with China. 42. The overall sex ratio at birth in the United States in 1900 is reported to be 1.048; in the year 2000 it is 1.049. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies LimitedANDERSON & RAY MISSING WOMEN: AGE AND DISEASE 1287 TABLE 8 Excess female deaths in developing regions (in 000s), 2000 and in the United States, 1900 Age group India China ssAfrica 1900 US At birth 184 644 0 0 0-4 310 132 192 75-14 93 2 70 815-29 258 24 578 4530-44 100 73 345 3045-59 120 89 84 2260-69 241 154 101 2370-79 300 336 112 1680+ 113 272 44 4 Total (mw A) 1712 1727 155 % Female population 0.34 0.31 0.50 0.42 Note: 1900 US female population approximately 37 million.

But there are other issues of classication.43Therefore, it is important to bear in mind that Table 9, which summarizes our results, can only provide rough estimates of the numberof missing women by disease. Nevertheless, the table unearths a pattern of mi ssing women in the historical data similar to that in developing countries today. A notable exception is that there appears to be signicantlyfewer missing girls (aged 0 to 4) in the historical data. One major reason for this (at leastrelative to India and China) is that there is very little respiratory female decit in the historicalUnited States in 1900, while these two decits are signicantly large in India and China. Thesedecits, by the way, point directly to pre- and post-natal gender discrimination in India and China in a way that does not seem to have been present in the historical United States, and possibly not in modern sub-Saharan Africa. 44 The table is conservative in its estimates of young missing females due to tuberculosis, which was a major killer in the 1900 United Sta tes. Modern developed regions do not have a large enough number of tuberculos is-related deaths at early ages to allow us to form reference death ratios with any degree of condence. As s oon as those reference ratios become reliable (post age 30), we do see a large number of excess female deaths due to tuberculosis. Asin Section 4.1, for the younger groups we use as reference the average death ratio from allinfectious diseases in developed countries in the relevant age group. If, instead, we use the 43. Among non-communicable disease, apoplexy and Bright's disease were recorded as leading killers. However, apoplexy was used to describe any death that began with a sudden loss of consciousness, especially if death followedsoon after. So, for instance, death from cardiac brillati on, a ruptured aneurysm, and perhaps even some perinatal or respiratory conditions were likely all clumped together. W e have included apoplexy under \"cardiovascular diseases\" in line with the present classication system, but be aw are that this probably accounts for at least some deaths in other categories. Similarly, Bright's disease is an old er classication for different forms of kidney disease. The term is no longer employed, as the relevant complex of kidney diseases would now be classied by their better understood aetiologies. The same can be said for deaths fro m \"convulsions\", which has been placed in the category of \"neuropsychiatric conditions\" under the present classication. 44. Another difference is reportedly high death rat es from non-communicable diseases for ages 0 to 4 in 1900 United States; and there is excess male mortality in this case. This is quite likely a misclassication problem. The two most signicant killers in this category are \"convulsions\" (cl assied as neuropsychiatric condition) and \"debility and atrophy\" (classied as congenital anomalies). Neither of th ese conditions is listed according to these terms in today's classication. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1288 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES TABLE 9 Excess female deaths by age and disease (in 00s); United States, 1900 45-59 60-69 70-79 80 + Group 1 85 26 168 201 80 68 64 21 A.

Relative to that b enchmark, it is possible to trace over 26,500 excess female deaths for women aged less than 30, suggesting that there is a signicant number of females missing on this score in the historical United States. Now we study the aggregates. Our historical da taset for the United States does not provide totals for Groups 1 and 2, and we must construct these ourselves as best we can from thesub-categories. The aggregate excess deaths for the two groups are obtained by adding excess female deaths from sub-categories A-D (we do not aggregate ner subdivisions, as data at those levels are just not comprehensive 45). We then obtain estimates for missing women by age by adding over Groups 1, 2, and \"Injuries\"; recall that these yield estimates that have beenpurged of compositional effects, and add up (over age) to mw B. Table 9 records these, as also our earlier estimates (mw A) with the compositional effects included. Unlike in developing regions, there appears t o be a signicant disease-composition effect. The shortfall, mw Amw B, is close to 30% of the total, something that was decidedly not the case for the developing countries studied earlier. However, the remarks in Section 2.6 following Observation 1 warn us that this is not a denitive test for a compositional effect. The reasonis that the disaggregated data may be missing some disease groups. This is unlikely (because the groups A-D are large, inclusive sub-groups), but possible. The Supporting Information to this paper provides supplementary evidence for a strong compositional effect. 6. MISSING WOMEN? SOME CONCEPTUAL ISSUES 6.1. The counterfactual As in Sen's counterfactual, the implicit presumption is that there are two differences between our country of interest and the reference c ountry. One is \"scale\": our country may be poorer and so have higher death rates for both men and women. The other is gender bias, reflected indifferent relative death rates. (2) implies that the former effect is not included in our computation of missing women; it is only the latter. Like all choices of reference standards, ours can be freely criticized. 46One might argue, for instance, that the absolute differences in death rates \"should\" form the relevant standard. Obviously, low death rates under any category mus t translate into low absolute male-female differences, and we are generally forced to the conclusion that there is little or no gender dif- ferential for reference death rates in that cate gory. For instance, suppose that female and male death rates for some category are 1 per 1000 and 2 per 1000, respectively, in the reference country, while they are 10 per 1000 and 12 per 1000, respectively, in the country of interest. By the \"relative\" reference standard we use (as do Sen and Coale and others), there are missingwomen in the country of interest. By the \"ab solute\" standard, there are missing men! 47While it 45. The conceptual advantage of building mw Bfrom the nest sub-groupings available is, of course, that we purge the totals of any change in disease composition, thereby allowing a cleaner comparison with mw A.B u tt h e disadvantage is, of course, that death information is simply not available over a full partition of the nest categories of diseases, so that there will be many omissions. 46. The comments that follow owe much to helpful discussions with Stefan Klasen.47. As a related but distinct consideration, we note tha t (2) embodies another implicit assumption: that the death rate for men in the country of interest is somehow th e \"right\" death rate, and that the female death rate is distorted (upwards). It is possible that both death rates are distorted: female upw ards, male downwards. In that case, the reference female death rate would be higher, and t his would scale down the number of missing women. We are grateful to Jean-Marie Baland for making this point. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1290 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES is important to keep these alternatives in mind, we prefer the scale neutrality that is embodied in the use of relative death rates. Such a discussion about the appropriate functional specication is related to a broader issue. How do we know that gender-based death r ates are not somehow \"naturally\" different at different levels of development? The epidemiological transition suggests that they may wellbe, once aggregated over disease. But we hav e already seen that compositional effects are minimal: missing women aggregated disease by d isease (with compositional changes removed) account for almost all of the grand total. That still leaves us with the rebuttal t hat relative death rates for each age and disease category might \"naturally\" vary with developm ent. But this statement is impossible to test with the data we have. We would have to presume \u2014at least for a sizable set of countries once poor, or poor countries today\u2014that there is no gender discrimination. The reader may nevertheless insist on computations for \"missing women\" that rely on reference standards from other countries that are poor today, or from now-rich countries when they were poor. For instance, one can recompute missing women by age (extending Table 3) by using Latin American and Caribbean countries as the reference group. The results are given in Appendix B. One might also use life tables based on European data from the 19thand early 20th centuries, but it is important to a ppreciate that life tables provide parametric estimates based on actual death rates prevailing in countries at different levels of development. There should be no presumption that these ar e somehow \"neutral\" towards gender in any aspect. In our opinion, any reference group that does not replicate what we see in developed countries today runs the risk of burying impor tant gender differen tials under the cover of a \"benchmark\". It is conceptually more satisf actory to presume that the \"natural\" relative death rates are indeed constant with developmen t, and then to view every departure from that benchmark as prima facie cause for suspicion (though not as conclusive evidence). Indeed, we are extremely cautious\u2014and in Section 6.2 below, will be very cautious again\u2014in interpreting our results as providing direct evidence of discrimination. We areopen to considering a collection of possible fact ors that might create the discrepancies we do observe. As the next subsectio n will make abundantly clear, we do notassert that all such departures represent overt (or even implicit) di scrimination against women. In general, there will be an entire complex of social, behavioural, and economic pathways that will need to beinvoked. Our research agenda is to highlight each of the sources of excess female mortalityin a unied and comparable way, so that the r elevant pathways can be explored in future research. But we nevertheless want to retain the ability to fully examine any observed departure from the gender-based death ratios we see in developed countries today . We are reluctant to conceal those departures by considering other benchmarks. 6.2. The pathways Estimates of missing women were originally meant to represent some measure of the degree of gender discrimination. That may or may not be the case. Much more work is needed toidentify the underlying mechanisms. There are certainly situations, such as exces s female deaths from \"Injuries\", that appear to serve as denitive indicators of overt violence against women. In South Asia, re-relateddeath is a leading cause; each year over 100,000 women are killed by res. In East Asia,self-inflicted intentional injuries is the pr imary cause of death: well over 100,000 women die \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies LimitedANDERSON & RAY MISSING WOMEN: AGE AND DISEASE 1291 each year from suicide. In India, excess deaths from injuries could well be associated with dowry.48Our calculations imply very large numbers for India. The Chinese case is also suggestive. According to the WHO, China is the only country in the world where women are more likely to commit suicide than men. Women are 25% more likely to commit suicide than men (in rural areas they are 66% more likely). This is surely reflected in our estimates on \"Injuries\". Most t heories focus on the low status of rural women to explain these startling differences (Phillips et al., 2002). Next, consider maternal mortality. A crucia l accomplishment of the twentieth century in the developed world is the virtual elimination of maternal mortality. By contrast, as is clear from our estimates, maternal death rates remain high in many parts of the developing world.49 Whether a woman dies while giving birth depends largely on timely and competent obstetric care. Despite this, a large proportion of maternal deaths in the developing world occur in hospitals (Ronsmans and Graham, 2006). Is this lack of \"similar care\"? At one level, the answer is no, because men do not give birth, so the question of similar care does not arise. Yet, in a broader context one might call it just that: the prospect of maternal death exi sts, while no similar prospect exists for males. \"Similar care\" might dictate that we eliminate this asymmetry. While we personally subscribe to this view, the situation is somewhat more ambiguous than it is for \"Injuries\". Now consider a more involved example. Cons ider missing women in sub-Saharan Africa as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The numbers are nothing short of dramatic: as Table 6 demonstrates, there are close to 600,000 excess female deaths each year from the virus (overa third of all missing women in sub-Saharan Africa). These extra deaths mainly occur at ages 15-44. The death rate from the HIV/AIDS virus for women of age 15-29 is 2.3 times that of males of the corresponding age. The overall fe male death rate from the virus is 1.2 times that for males. Elsewhere in the world, in contrast, the death rate from the virus for males is higher at all ages. The ratio is as high as 4:1 in high-income countries. 50 To understand the extent to which these extra female deaths correspond to discrimination, it is important to understand the signicant mal e slant in the reference rate. In developed countries, it might be thought that men who have sex with men (MSM) engage in risky, unprotected sex, thereby increasing the chances of transmission. But evidence from the United States indicates that the incidence of unprotect ed sex is fully comparable for heterosexual and homosexual encounters.51MSM intrinsically exhibit higher transmission rates.52As the calibrations of Goodreau and Golden (2007) for the United States reveal, \"In order for US heterosexual individuals to have a generali zed epidemic, they would need to adopt levels of unprotected sex several times higher than those currently exhibited by MSM\". 48. Indeed, the custom of dowry has been linked to bride-bur ning and dowry-death (and violence more generally) if promised dowry payments are not forthcoming (see, for example, Bloch and Rao, 2002). The National Crime Bureauof the Government of India reports approximately 6000 dow ry deaths every year, but numerous incidents of dowry- related violence are never reporte d. Menski (1998) puts the number at roughly 25,000 brides who are harmed or killed each year. 49. Using our historical example, the death rate from maternal causes in the United States in 1900, for women aged 15 to 29, was 0.50 per 1000 women. In South Asia today the rate is similar at 0.53 and in sub-Saharan Africait is much higher at 1.34. 50. The corresponding ratio is 3 in South Asia and more than 2 in East Asia, the Pacic, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and North Africa. 51. See Catania et al. (2001) and Goodreau and Golden (2007). 52. Goodreau and Golden (2007) discuss this issue in some d etail. Briefly, there are two reasons for the higher transmission rate: penile-anal sex is more susceptible to tr ansmission than penile-vaginal sex, and transmission is higher for receptive partners, and among MSM the same indi vidual often plays both an insertive and receptive role. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1292 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES In the light of these observations, the high levels of heterosexua l transmission in sub- Saharan Africa acquire enormous salience. There is little doubt that poverty, undernutrition, and poor health care play their part in the overall transmission of HIV. But our interest lies not in the overall rate of transmission but in its reversal of male-female incidence. It is, therefore, hard to escape arguments such as those made by the WHO, which emphasize the role of unequal power and violence.53It seems evident that the multiplicity of female sexual partners among males, the preva lence of transactional sex, the existence of violent or forced sex, and the relative inability of women to nego tiate safer sex practices have much to do with this extraordinary discrepancy.54 There could be other reasons for greater heterosexual t ransmission that have nothing explic- itly to do with female discrimination. For example , it is possible that certain aspects of poverty can create \"unintended\" gender biases rela tive to the developed- country benchmark.55The accounting methodology that we follow is entirely silent on matters of interpretation. The case for (or against) lack of similar care has to be made separately. The cardiovascular decit presents another s ort of interpretative quandary. A key nding is that heart disease accounts for a large fraction of excess female mortality. In developingcountries, women simply die of cardiovascular disease at a rate closer to that of men. 56There is an entire array of hypotheses to explain the phenom enon. It could be genetic: for instance, the recently discovered \"heart disease gene\" so prevalent in South Asia (Dhandapany et al., 2009) may be equally present in males and females, the reby lowering the gender skew in incidence.57 Lifestyle differences by gender may be important : diet, attention to personal health and well- being, and so on. Or it may truly be lack of \"similar care\": women seek or receive medicalcare less often in developing countries, or may be subject to greater stress. Understanding why women appear to be at a particular disadvantage from cardiovascular disease is important work for future research. It is beyond the scope of this paper to disentangl e the role of direct gender discrimination from other factors\u2014biological, social, environm ental, behavioural, or economic\u2014in explaining the pervasive phenomenon of excess female mortality. 58This is an important direction for future research and is already a central item on t he policy agenda for international development agencies. By moving away from (while not abandoning) recent literature that highlights theimportance of the sex ratio at birth as a key d eterminant of missing women, we have taken a preliminary step towards a unied study of a much broader set of issues. In other words, while some of these sources of female decits, s uch as cardiovascular disease, may be known, our methodology puts them into one unied fra mework where the numbers from sources as diverse as Injuries, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular, or birth can be put together and compared. 53. For a summary of this position, see http://www.who.int/gender/hiv aids/en/. 54. On these and related matters, see, e.g. Bongaarts (1996); Maman et al. (2000); Gupta (2002); Dunkle et al. (2004), and Silverman et al. (2007). 55. For instance, poverty and the lack of health care precipitate a higher rate of genital ulceration, which may serve to reduce the gap between MSM and heterosexual trans mission rates. Schistosomiasis\u2014infection by a parasitic worm\u2014affects millions in sub-Saharan Africa. In women, it da mages the lining of the vagina, which protects against HIV transmission. On schistosomiasis and HIV transmission, see e.g. Chenine et al. (2008), though exact magnitudes are harder to quantify because of the bi-directional nat ure of the relationship (Secor, Karanka and Colley, 2004). 56. See Nikiforov and Mamaev (1998) for a historical perspective on gender imbalances in cardiovascular disease in now-developed countries. 57. The death rates from cardiovascular disease in India are well known to be high. Even in rural areas of India, chronic diseases (primarily coronary) a re now the leading cause of death (see Joshi et al., 2006). 58. There is a large literature aimed at explaining differential mortality patterns by gender in developed countries; see, e.g. Nathanson (1984) for a survey. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies LimitedANDERSON & RAY MISSING WOMEN: AGE AND DISEASE 1293 6.3. Stocks and flows Unlike several of the central papers we have cited, such as Sen (1990) and Coale (1991), our paper discusses annual \"flows\" of missing women, rather than the existing \"stock\" at any point of time. To understand the issues involved in conver ting flows to stocks, consider the difference between the actual female death rate and the corresponding reference rate: /Delta1(a)dw(a)uw(a). In computing the flow of missing women at age a, we multiply /Delta1(a) by the female population at age a, as we have already done. However, the impact of /Delta1(a) on the overall stock of missing women is more far-reaching: it affects every cohort of women currently older than a.M o r e precisely, a cohort of age a/primeis diminished at an earlier age aby an amount that depends on the value of /Delta1(a) that prevailed a/primeayears ago. In general, we lack data on this value and this creates a serious difculty in converting the flow numbers to stocks. We could make the\"steady state\" assumption that all age-specic death rates have remained constant over several years, but it would have to be defended, an d that is beyond the scope of this paper. However, it is worth noting that, no matter how we resolve this issue, a given proportional flow at an earlier age must be more important than the same flow at a later age. It will simply affect more women, and must therefore transl ate into larger stocks. Simply as an example, we report our tentative estimates under the assumption of time-invariance of /Delta1.W e n d approximately 20 million missing women in Indi a, 58 million missing women in China, and 8 million missing women in sub-Saharan Africa. Look at the enormous difference betweenChina and the other two regions (in flows all three regions were about the same). This comes from the fact that excess female deaths in China are clustered at age 0. We reiterate, though, that these estimates must be treated with a great deal of caution. 7. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION Dening missing women by differences in aggregate sex ratios can be misleading, or uninfor-mative (or both). It is misleading because different countries have different fertility and deathrates, and (in particular) different age distr ibutions. They will have different disease compo- sitions. They may also have different sex ratios at birth for genetic or environmental reasonsthat have nothing to do with missing females. The procedure is also uninformative: we cannot tell at what ages the missing women are clustered, or what diseases are responsible . Thus, we cannot begin to ask about the various channels: discrimination, biology, social nor ms, and so on. Answering these questions is of profound importance. By unpacking missing women by age and disease, our paper takes alimited and preliminary step in this direction. Our study of excess female deaths by age yields two key ndings. First, once we control for natural variations in the sex ratio at birth, sub-Saharan Africa has as many missing women as India and China: signicantly more as a percentage of the female population. Second, themajority of missing women are of adult age. S ub-Saharan Africa has no missing females at birth, while the corresponding proportion for I ndia is under 11%. China's missing females, in contrast, are largely prenatal. About 37-45% of them may be classied as missing at birth. But all these regions display missing women at a variety of ages. For instance, excess female mortality up to age 15 does not account for more tha n a third of the total in India or sub-Saharan Africa. Our study of excess female deaths by age and disease yields the following ndings. For developing countries today, the epi demiological transition\u2014the changing composition of dis- ease\u2014explains very little of excess female mortality. At young ages, the Group 1 diseases are \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1294 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES largely responsible for missing women. The opposite is true at older ages; Group 2 diseases are responsible. Aside from these commonalities, each region tell s a different story. In India, communicable, preventable diseases explain missing girls in childhood. Maternal mortality and injuries areimportant at the reproductive ages. Cardiovascul ar deaths are an overwhelmingly strong source of missing women at older ages in India and dominate all other sources of excess female mortality. Finally, congenital deaths at infancy, as well as Injuries, account for a suspiciously large total of excess female deaths in India. These excess deaths easily outnumber maternal mortality. In sub-Saharan Africa, missing girls also die prematurely from preventable diseases: malaria is a primary killer. As to India, maternal deaths are also important. But thedominant source of missing women in sub-Saharan Africa is HIV/AIDS. It accounts for well over a third ofexcess female deaths in the region. (That said, sub-Saharan African percentages of missing women are still comparable to those in India and China even if the excess female deaths from HIV/AIDS is entirely ignored.) In China, by contrast, the dominant source of mi ssing females is prenatal. That said, there are excess female deaths in childhood which are due to respiratory and perinatal causes. To us,these are warning signs that active female dis crimination in China possibly stretches beyond the prenatal. Indeed, a large chunk of missing women in China, as well as in India, are found after the age of 45. In China, these excess d eaths from Group 2 diseases account for close to 40% of the flow of all missing women. The corre sponding gure for India is also 40%. These numbers point to the importance of studying the conditions of elderly women in India and China. As a nal note, we observe some similarities between age-specic percentages of missing women in the historical United States (ca. 1900) and India or sub-Saharan Africa today. Our exercise cannot disentangle the role of dir ect gender discrimination from other factors (biological, social, environmental, behaviour al, or economic) in explaining \"missing women\". But it allows us to seek out potential pathways of influence, and to assess the comparative contributions made by various categories to ove rall excess female mortality. In this context, observe that \"category\" need not be circumscribed b y just age and disease. For instance, inspired by the work of Das Gupta (1987), Muhuri and Presto n (1991), and others on family composition and female mortality, we could\u2014in principle\u2014assess the contribution of the category \"girls aged 0-5 with female siblings\" to overall ex cess female mortality. We could compare this category with something entirely different, suc h as \"Injuries\". Because our approach can easily put a variety of categories into one unied fra mework, it may have the potential to inform future comparative research in these areas. APPENDIX A. DESCRIPTION OF DATA SOURCES Throughout, we use data from the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO uses a variety of sources to obtain estimates of death rates.59For developed countries, data on population numbers, births, and deaths come from vital registration data. For our key regions of interest, relia ble vital registration systems are generally incomplete. At times they are entirely non-existent (particularly in parts of sub-Saharan Africa). In the absence of complete vital regis tration data, the WHO combines the mos t recent census and survey materials together with demographic techniques to compute their estim ates. For China, the availability of the 2000 census (which collected data on all deaths between 1999 and 2000 for each hous ehold) made direct estimates of age-specic death 59. Consult Mathers et al. (2004) for a detailed description of data sources and methods for these estimates. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies LimitedANDERSON & RAY MISSING WOMEN: AGE AND DISEASE 1295 rates possible.60Using demographic techniques, it is possible to e stimate the incidence of under-reporting for both males and females and the data we use is adjusted to correct for this.61For India, separate mortality and recording systems for rural and urban areas were used to estimate deat h rates by age and sex for rural and urban areas and these were added to obtain national death rates. The all-cause mortality rates were derived from a time series analysis ofage-specic death rates from the Sample Registratio n System after correcting them for under-registration. 62 Relative to China and India, the task of estimating reliabl e mortality rates for sub-Saharan Africa is more challeng- ing. Recent vital registration data are only available for 20% of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Otherwise, the main data sources used include the Demographic Health Survey s (which cover 80% of countries in sub-Saharan Africa) as well as census data (available for 73% of countries).63Other sources include the World Fertility Surveys (a predecessor of the DHS surveys), the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (collected by UNICEF), and National Integrated Houshold Surveys (akin to the Living Standard Measurement Surve ys collected by the World Bank). Using all of the data at hand, together with regression techniques and a set of roughly 2000 life tables judged to be of good quality, the WHO computed estimates for mortality rates (excluding HIV/AI DS and war deaths) by age and gender for all sub-Saharan African countries. HIV/AIDS deaths and war deaths were then added to total mortality rates where necessary. The reliability of these estimates, for sub-Sahara n Africa in particular, has been challenged (Cooper et al., 1998). But we have no other data at our disposal. Because our aim is t o compare estimates of missing women across different regions of the world, the efforts made by the WHO to comput e comparable mortality rates worldwide is the best we can depend upon. Where possible, we compare the estimates we use here to alternative data sources. In general, wend no signicant disparities. This is probably the case b ecause the WHO has already incorporated any alternative micro-level survey data that we have access to (for exa mple, Census information for India and China, and DHS surveys for sub-Saharan Africa), to derive their estimates. The GBD used numerous data sources and epidemiological models to estimate the rst comprehensive worldwide cause-of-death patterns in 14 age-sex groups for over 130 important diseases. 64The estimates reflect all of the information currently available to the WHO.65On a routine basis, member states are required to submit the latest cause-of-death data from their vital registration resources. I n the absence of a complete and accurate vital registration system, countries are requested to submit all other reliable sources. For these countries (primarily in the developingworld), cause-of-death data have been carefully analysed to ta ke into account incomplete coverage of vital registration data and the likely differences in cause-of-death patterns that would be expected in the uncovered and often poorersub-populations. It is important to be aware of the limitations of this dataset. Cause-specic mortality data for China is available fro m two sources: the sample vital registration system, monitored by the Ministry of Health; and the Disease Sur veillance Point System, monitored by the Chinese Center for Disease Control. The population covered by these tw o systems is approximately 140 million. Both systems 60. Aside from vital registration data for 1987-2000, the entire set of sources used for China include the 1990 and 2000 census; Disease Surveillance Points 1991- 1990; Fertility Sampling Survey 1992; National Survey on Fertility and Birth Control 1988; Female Fertility in China: Population Survey 1982; Popul ation Sample Survey 1987, 1990-1994, 1995, and 1996-1998; Child and Maternal Surveillance System 1991-1998. 61. Demographic techniques to assess the completeness o f recorded mortality data are based on certain assump- tions regarding the stability of population growth rates and migration. Refer to Hill (2003) for a summary of themethods used to estimate mortality rates in developing countries. 62. Apart from vital registration data from 1990 to 1999, other sources used include Census of India 1981, 1991; National Family Planning Survey 1970; Second All India Pla nning Survey 1980; Survey on Infant and Child Mortality 1979; National Family Health Survey 1992, 2000. 63. The DHS surveys collect complete sibling histori es from repsondents. Hill and Trussell (1991) developed a method to estimate sex- and age-specic death rates from t his information. Inter-censal survival data can be used together with demographic methods such as the \"growth-b alanced\" technique to compute sex and age-specic death rates. Refer to Gakidou et al. (2004) for more discussion. 64. Worldwide comparability of cause-of-death data has been made possible through the development and revi- sions of the International Statistical Classication of D iseases (ICD), adopted in the early 1990s. To be sure, accuracy in diagnosing causes of death varies by country. To produce unbiased estimates of cause-specic death rates andto maximize comparability across countries, deaths c oded to ill-dened categories are redistributed pro rata across all causes excluding injuries. Correction algorithms ar e also applied to resolve problems of miscoding. The cause categories used for the GBD study follow the principles of ICD that each death is categorically attributed to one underlying cause. 65. The GBD study uses the all-cause number of deaths, by age and sex, to provide an \"envelope\" which constrains individual disease and injury estimates of deat hs. Therefore, the sum of deaths from all specic causes for any age-sex group must sum to the estimates of the total number of deaths for that age-sex group. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies Limited1296 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES have sample sites which are classied into urban and rural and also into different socioeconomic strata. Age-specic mortality rates for specic conditions and for each stratum o f the population are estimated and these are then aggregated up proportionately, corrected for under-registration, and a djusted with information from WHO technical programmes on specic cause mortality. For India, cause-specic patterns of mortality were based on the Medical Certicate of Cause of Death for urban areas and the Annual Survey of Causes of Death for rural a reas. Additional sources from large-scale verbal autopsy studies were used to implement an algorithm to redistribut e ill-dened deaths to specic causes. The cause-specic mortality estimates at the aggregated national level were then adjusted from WHO technical programmes on specic cause mortality. For countries without vital registration data on cause of death (and most of sub-Saharan Africa comes under this heading), the WHO estimated cause-of-death models us ing maximum likelihood techniques. Estimates of death rates across diseases were based on estimated total mortality rates and average per capita income. Regional model patterns of specic causes of death within each cause group have been constructed from vital registration data from neighbouring countries with similar patterns of mortality and i ncome. Specic causes are further adjusted on the basis of epidemiological evidence from registr ies, verbal autopsy studies, disease s urveillance systems, and analysis from WHO technical programmes. For sub-Saharan Africa in par ticular, a regional model pattern of specic causes of deaths was based on vital registration data from urban and rural South Africa.66The weights used for each country were determined by overall mortality death r ates and income levels of those countries. There are other hurdles. In general, deaths resulting fro m war are not systematically included in causes of death from the vital registration system. Likewise, deaths due to AIDS and drug use are typically undercounted. In most cases, adjustments for deaths due to these causes have been made using other sources. For instance, country-specic estimates of HIV and AIDS mortality have been develope d by the joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and WHO and revised periodically. Country-specic estim ates of war deaths and corresponding uncertainty ranges were obtained from a variety of publishe d and unpublished war mortality databases.67Epidemiological estimates for key causes in developing countries are also taken into acc ount. For example, for Africa, country-specic estimates of malaria mortality were based on an analysis by Snow et al. (1999) and updated using the most recent geographical distributions of risks in MARA (Mapping Malaria Risk in A frica). For maternal mortality, various surveys such as the DHS were used together with epidemiological models. Faced with the numerous and necessary interpolations as well as the reliance on a variety of data sources (none of which was systematically created to seamlessly work with the others), it is tempting t o dismiss the GBD results as uninformative at best, or even misleading. On balance, while we recognize the many limitations of the data and have taken pains to point them out here, howev er briefly, this is not our conclusion. Of course , caution is required when inferring comparability of national disease burden assessmen ts across countries. This is especially true of estimates where there is no functioning vital registration syste m for cause of death. Judged by the demanding standards of detailed micro-surveys, the GBD is obviously not good e nough. However, judged by the standards of data used in macroeconomic cross-country regressions, it is probably pretty good. In any case, it is the best data we have. APPENDIX B. OTHER REFERENCE BENCHMARKS The paper uses developed countries as a reference group. Table B1 recomputes our estimates of missing women in our paper using Latin America and the Caribbean as the reference group. For each region, the rst of the two columns reproduces those in Table 3 from the paper (with developed-country benchmarks), while the second column uses the Latin American/Caribbean benchmarks. Before interpreting these estimates it should be noted th at, relative to developed countries, 0.06% of the female population is missing in Latin America and the Caribbean and the majority are of age 60 and older. These missing women in Latin America and the Caribbean correspond roughly to the decrease in missing women we observe if we instead use this region as the reference group comp ared to our estimates in Table 3. The estimates for China decrease the most, and the percentage of missing women in China older than 15 is now 40%, compared to 55% inthe main calculations. For India, the percentage of missi ng women older than 15 falls from 66 to 59%. The estimates 66. The exception is Zimbabwe, which also has data on cau se-specic death rates from the vital registration system. For some countries, other sources were also ava ilable such as hospital mortality data, deaths certied by medical personnel, and verbal autopsy reports. This was th e case for the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, and Senegal. 67. Deaths due to landmines and unexploded ordnance were estimated separately. \u00a92010 The Review of Economic Studies LimitedANDERSON & RAY MISSING WOMEN: AGE AND DISEASE 1297 TABLE B1 Excess female deaths by age (in 000s), usin g Latin America/Caribbean as Benchmark India China ssAfrica Age group DC LAC DC LAC DC LAC At birth 184 184 644 644 0 0 0-1 146 146 109 109 32 321-4 164 150 23 19 160 1275-9 62 60 2 2 40 3710-14 31 28 0 13 02 7 15-19 77 81 1 2 98 103 20-24 102 104 7 9 222 22625-29 79 80 18 18 258 26030-34 50 55 24 28 195 20835-39 17 27 26 32 103 1214 0 - 4 4 2 73 02 32 44 75 24 5 - 4 9 2 41 53 32 52 41 45 0 - 5 4 4 12 62 81 52 51 355-59 56 20 29 1 35 1660-64 86 30 53 0 43 1465-69 155 79 100 17 57 2370-74 188 126 150 70 62 3475-79 112 63 185 106 50 2780-84 72 42 151 84 30 148 5 - 8 9 3 21 98 34 71 1 4 90-94 9 5 31 16 2 0 9 5 - 9 9 106100100+ 001 100 Total (mw A) 1712 1368 0.31 0.20 0.47 0.42 Numbers do not sum to total, or may app ear identical because of rounding error. Sources: Global Burden of Disease (2002) and Table 3. for sub-Saharan Africa are affected the least. The main ndings are qualitatively unaltered, even though (as already stated) we are uncomfortable with this approach. Several demographers who have researched missing women argue that a better reference group is to use Coale-Demeny model life tables (see Coale, 1991; Klasen and Wink, 2003). Model life tables are primarily used topredict mortality rates when data is scarce. The Coale-Demen y tables use historical data (mainly from Europe) from as far back as before 1870 to just after the war in 1945 to predict mortality rates by age and gender at varying overall mortality and population growth rates. There are four differ ent model life tables (North, South, East, and West) built off different regional data. The phrase \"model tables\" might suggest that these are best estimates of \"natural death rates\" at different levels of development; however, that is not the case, as the tables are indeed built off actual data. Therefore, they incorporate existing social conditions around death, including possible gende r discrimination or other (preventable) factors making for excess female mortality. In any case, when we use the se model life tables as a reference group, our estimates of missing women are signicantly reduced. For China, the annual total missing women is roughly 950,000 and for India it is roughly 650,000. We generally no longer have many missing women older than 60, and for some of themodel life tables, we actually have missing men in these age categories. This is particularly true for sub-Saharan Africa, where the overall estimates of missing women are very small, as we have so many missing men in the older age categories. If, on the other hand, we consider only missing women aged 1-45, then we estimate roughly 400,000missing women each year for sub-Saharan Africa. Acknowledgements.
