In 1904, he entered medical school in Japan. \"A glorious future unfurled in my mind,\" [he recalled](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/12/rereading-julia-lovell-lu-xun), \"in which I would return to my homeland after graduation and set about medicating its suffering sick.\" But Lu Xun came to believe that medicine, by itself, could engineer only a limited form of progress. To alter the fate of his country, he wrote, his people must \"change their spirit.\" He abandoned medical school and returned to China, and, in the next decades, he turned to essays, poetry, and short stories to rage against the perils facing China in the early twentieth century\u2014fear, poverty, conformity, and nationalism among them. In 1923, Lu laid down perhaps his most enduring metaphor, for the dilemma that injustice imposes on those who must choose between complacency and fury. He wrote: Silence, Lu concluded, was tempting but inexcusable; awakening even the few might also save the others. And so he wrote, in order to \"encourage those fighters who are galloping on in loneliness,\" as he put it, in the introduction to \"Outcry,\" his first collection of stories. A century after Lu Xun imagined the suffocations of the iron house, China is besieged by a modern crisis of body and spirit, an epidemic that has threatened its people and underscored the perils of a suffocating politics. By Wednesday, the coronavirus had sickened more than forty thousand people there and killed more than a thousand. The disease had spread to at least twenty-four countries, sparking fears of a global scourge, as well as an economic chain reaction, as China's economic behemoth fell silent. By the first week of February, home sales in China had fallen by ninety per cent compared with last February; car dealers predicted that the month's sales would fall by up to eighty per cent, compared with last year. Half of China's four-thousand-plus Starbucks were closed. In the epicenter, Wuhan, a quarantined city of eleven million people, the disease has been met with courage and stoicism. At least five hundred doctors and nurses have fallen ill, and patients and hospital staff struggle with a shortage of beds, oxygen bottles, and other supplies. In a nighttime video of a residential neighborhood, where people have been confined for weeks, residents in modern apartment towers cry out to one another through open windows: \"Wuhan, stay strong!\" The government has fought to shape the perception of the epidemic, even after the death of [Li Wenliang](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/grief-and-wariness-at-a-vigil-for-li-wenliang-the-doctor-who-tried-to-warn-china-about-the-coronavirus), a heroic ophthalmologist who was one of the first to sound the alarm about the coronavirus. The police had accused him of spreading rumors, warning, \"If you keep being stubborn, fail to repent, and continue illegal activities, you will be brought to justice.\" But Li was unbowed. He told Caixin, an investigative magazine based in Beijing, \"I think a healthy society should not only have one kind of voice.\" When Li contracted the virus, and then died, on February 7th, state censors panicked; in a grim charade, they blocked news of his death for hours. In the following days, they tried to stifle the public grief and outrage, by allowing online commenters to praise his heroism but striking down comments that linked his ordeal to China's tightening constraints on speech. Even by the standards of China's propaganda system, the effort to control the world's understanding of the virus cast a harsh light on the political culture that President Xi Jinping has encouraged. Since Xi removed term limits in 2018, much of the bureaucracy has slipped into a posture of resigned obedience, avoiding responsibility and elevating political symbolism. As the virus spread, the government generated admiring headlines around the world by announcing the construction of two hospitals in a matter of days, but [Caixin found](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-02-11/coronavirus-latest-since-feb-1-confirmed-cases-14380-in-china-canada-starts-limited-evacuation-but-no-travel-ban-101510591.html) that function lags behind publicity; Leishenshan Hospital had been touted as a facility capable of treating fifteen hundred patients, but, when it opened, on February 8th, it had only thirty beds. It will almost certainly add more\u2014the city is desperately overstretched\u2014but this sort of gap between hype and reality has strained the Chinese public's faith in official pronouncements about the crisis. Last week, in the spirit of Lu Xun's admonitions against silence, the epidemic inspired a manifesto from Xu Zhangrun, a law professor at Tsinghua University, who has emerged as the most prominent intellectual critic of Xi Jinping. Since Xi suspended term limits, the professor, who is a scholar of Chinese constitutional law, has circulated a series of searing critiques of one-man rule and the campaign to eliminate challenges to the Communist Party. On February 4th, he [published online](https://matters.news/@Zhizhu_2019/%E8%BD%89%E8%BC%89-%E8%A8%B1%E7%AB%A0%E6%BD%A4-%E6%84%A4%E6%80%92%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%91%E5%B7%B2%E4%B8%8D%E5%86%8D%E6%81%90%E6%83%A7-zdpuAtQTLkEf6MGa17RjcBdJFHFZAdRTfHPUgDBkCVkTUSg3o) \"Viral Alarm,\" an essay that faults Xi and the Party for initially suppressing the discovery of the virus and punishing truthtellers, a campaign of official silence that \"served to embolden deception at every level of government.\" He wrote, \"No matter how complex, nuanced, and sophisticated one's analysis, the reality is stark. A polity that is blatantly incapable of treating its own people properly can hardly be expected to treat the rest of the world well. How can a nation that doggedly refuses to become a modern political civilization really expect to be part of a meaningful community?\" The essay extends a theme of social criticism that has coursed through modern China, from Lu Xun to the writings of Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel laureate, who died in 2017 while serving an eleven-year prison sentence for subversion. Geremie R. Barm\u00e9, an independent historian in New Zealand, who [translated Xu's essays](http://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/viral-alarm-when-fury-overcomes-fear), told me, \"Writers like Lu Xun and Xu Zhangrun, and like Xiaobo as well as so many others, repeatedly warn against the authoritarian practice summed up by the term , qian kou, an ancient expression meaning 'to clamp mouths shut.' Although their views and political aspirations differed, they have a shared contempt for, and warn against, the millennia-old autocratic tradition.\" In his essay on the virus, Xu called on the government to live up to Article 35 of the Chinese constitution, which guarantees \"freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession, and of demonstration.\" But Xu has no illusion that any change is coming soon. For his writing, he has already paid a heavy price: Last March, Tsinghua University demoted him and banned him from teaching and publishing. He continues to write, though, and his work has circulated widely among Chinese intellectuals and abroad. Because his latest essay assails Chinese leaders at a vulnerable moment, he expected that it might incur a harsher punishment\u2014that, as he wrote, \"this may well even be the last piece I write.\" Still, he ended with a call to his countrymen \"who have no way of fleeing this land.\" He wrote, \"I call on them: rage against this injustice; let your lives burn with a flame of decency; break through the stultifying darkness and welcome the dawn.\" A century ago, Lu Xun believed that for China to become truly modern, to reclaim its place among the world's great powers, it must acknowledge that its people have, as the late doctor Li put it, more than \"one kind of voice.\" Lu wanted writers to avoid the ancient literary forms and adopt a vernacular Chinese that would expand the realm of both readers and writers. In [a speech](http://www.chinafile.com/library/nyrb-china-archive/true-story-of-lu-xun) in Hong Kong, in 1927, he said, \"Youth must first transform China into a China with a voice. They must speak boldly, move forward courageously, forget all considerations of personal advantage, push aside the ancients, and express their authentic feelings.\" He died in 1936. But the struggle he described, to move past what he called the \"voiceless China,\" still rages.
