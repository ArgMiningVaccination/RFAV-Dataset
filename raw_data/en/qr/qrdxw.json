Independent 3-day dietary records at baseline and8 years later provided estimates of subjects' nutrient in-take by dietary pattern. Chronic disease risk factor statuswas compared at baseline and 16-year follow-up across allmale dietary patterns.Statistical analyses Cluster analysis was applied to food frequency data to identify non-overlapping male dietarypatterns. Analysis of covariance and logistic regressionwere used to compare nutrient intake, summary nutri-tional risk scores, and chronic disease risk status at base-line and follow-up by male dietary pattern.Results Five distinct and comprehensive dietary patterns of Framingham Offspring-Spouse men were identiedand ordered according to overall nutritional risk: Transi-tion to Heart Healthy, Higher Starch, Average Male,Lower Variety, and Empty Calories. Nutritional risk washigh and varied by dietary pattern; key nutrient con-trasts were stable over 8-year follow-up. Chronic diseaserisk also varied by dietary pattern and specic subgroupdifferences persisted over 16 years, notably rates of over- weight/obesity and smoking.Conclusions Quantitative cluster analysis applied to food frequency questionnaire data identied ve distinct, com-prehensive, and stable dietary patterns of adult Framing-ham Offspring-Spouse cohort men. The close associationsbetween the dietary patterns, nutritional risk, andchronic disease proles of men emphasize the importanceof targeted preventive nutrition interventions to promotehealth in the male population.J Am Diet Assoc. 2005;105:1723-1734.

Current expert population- based nutrition recommendations emphasize dietary pat-terns that offer a wide variety of micronutrient-densefoods, limit empty kilocalories, and encourage the con-sumption of protective dietary factors that lower chronicdisease risk ( 1-8). Despite national health campaigns to encourage healthful eating practices among Americans,there is an epidemic of obesity and diabetes ( 6) and the diets of many people remain low in micronutrient densityand high in total and saturated fat, sugars, and sodium(1-3). A review of the achievements in the National Cho- lesterol Education Program ( 9) suggests that future im- provements in population health will not be accomplisheduntil nutrition interventions demonstrate effectiveness inpromoting long-term healthful dietary behavior. To fur-ther these goals, experts have underscored the impor-tance of characterizing unique dietary patterns in thepopulation to more fully evaluate their associations withhealth and disease outcomes and to examine their roles inpromoting optimal food and nutrient intake ( 10-12 ). We previously validated the cluster analysis approach used in application with semi-quantitative dietary as-sessment methods (food frequency questionnaires[FFQs]) to identify distinct and comprehensive dietarypatterns of Framingham men and women ( 12-14 ). We have conducted particularly detailed evaluations of theassociations between the dietary patterns of women and avariety of health outcomes, including carotid stenosis (apreclinical marker of cardiovascular diseases [CVDs])(15,16 ), the development of overweight and obesity ( 17), and the metabolic syndrome ( 18,19 ). In this report, we explore in-depth the dietary patterns of Framingham Off-spring-Spouse cohort men, characterizing their associ-ated nutritional risk and stability over 8 years of follow-up. We also examine the persistent chronic disease riskcharacteristics of Framingham Offspring-Spouse cohortmen by dietary pattern through the most recent Framing-ham study follow-up examinations. METHODS ParticipantsFor more than 50 years, the Framingham Heart Study has investigated the natural progression of CVDs and,more recently, other health problems among residents ofFramingham, MA ( 20,21 ). In 1971, a second-generation cohort was recruited and 5,124 Framingham study off-spring and their spouses were invited to participate in theFramingham Offspring-Spouse study (2,483 men and2,641 women) ( 22). Members of the Framingham Offspring-Spouse cohort participate in standardized clinical assessments aboutevery 4 years, including a complete physical exam, labo-ratory tests, noninvasive diagnostic testing, and updatingof medical histories and other pertinent information. Atcertain examinations, detailed dietary data are collected.The dietary patterns and nutrient intake reported herewere collected among Framingham Offspring-Spousemen at exams 3 (1984-1988) and 5 (1992-1996). CVD riskfactor proles were assessed at exams 3 and 7 (1998-2001). The Boston University Medical Center's HumanSubjects Institutional Review Board approved all proto-cols and all participants provided informed consent.Identifying Dietary Patterns The dietary patterns of men were characterized using cluster analysis applied to food consumption data derivedfrom the 145-item FFQ ( 12-14 ). Some 1,666 men, 91% of those who participated in exam 3, provided complete FFQdietary data information for these analyses (approxi-mately 1,831 men, aged 18 to 77 years, participated atFramingham Offspring-Spouse exam 3; ie, 74% of theoriginal Framingham Offspring-Spouse cohort male sub-jects). Details of the cluster analysis methodology and its application in the Framingham Nutrition Studies havebeen described previously ( 12-14 ). In brief, we classied the 145 FFQ items into 38 groupings of foods that weresimilar to but more detailed than those found in theAmerican Dietetic Association's Exchange List for MealPlanning ( 23,24 groupings were based on similari- ties in nutrient content (such as vitamin A-rich vegeta-bles and medium-fat meats). In a renement of thismethod that focuses on food-related distinctions in thedietary patterns, three alcohol items (beer, wine, andliquor) were excluded in these analyses. Next, the 38 foodgroups were clustered, based on similarities in their re-ported frequency of consumption, using the standard sta-tistical method VARCLUS (SAS version 6, 1989; SASInstitute, Inc; Cary, NC). This resulted in 13 food clusters(see footnotes to Table 1 ) that contained food groups with similar reported frequency of consumption in men (num-ber of daily servings). It is important to note that thisprocedure clusters foods according to their usual fre-quency of consumption, not by intake at similar times ofday, at the same meal, or in similar serving sizes. Forexample, relative to other men in this cohort, those whoreported a relatively higher consumption of whole grainsalso consumed the following food groups more frequently:low-fat dairy products, low-fat poultry, low-fat healthfoods, oils, and soft vegetable fats. In the nal step,Ward's clustering method ( 25) was used to separate men into nonoverlapping groups based on similarities in thefrequency of their consumption of the 13 food groupings.Five comprehensive and nonoverlapping dietary patternsof Framingham men emerged from these analyses. Estimating Nutrient Intake In addition to dening habitual dietary patterns, we es- tablished independent estimates of nutrient intake from3-day dietary records collected at baseline and 8 years offollow-up using our validated, published methodology(26,27 ). Nutrient calculations were performed using the Minnesota Nutrition Data System software (version 2.6,1988, Food Database 6A and Nutrient Database 23, Nu-trition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota,Minneapolis) ( 28). We also computed each subject's overall nutritional risk by ranking his intake of each nutrient or dietary componentin comparison with other men and then determining theperson's mean ranking on the 19 nutrients that were exam-ined in this report. We previously published this approachas part of the validation of the dietary clustering method(14). For risk-related dietary factors (total and saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium) and for energy, protein, andmonounsaturated fats, men's intakes were ranked from 1724 November 2005 Volume 105 Number 11Table 1.

November 2005 Journal of the AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION 1725lowest to highest (indicating rising levels of risk associated with higher ranks). For polyunsaturated fat, protective di-etary components (dietary ber, starch, and carbohydrate),or essential nutrients, men's intakes were ranked highest tolowest (indicating rising risk associated with lower intakes).Age-adjusted mean summary nutritional risk ranks werecomputed for the men in each dietary pattern group. Sum-mary nutritional risk scores do not reflect absolute nutri-tional risk (as would comparison with an expert standardlike the National Cholesterol Education Program ( 4,5), but rather they provide an assessment of relative nutritionalrisk (such as lower intakes of protective dietary componentsand higher levels of risk-related nutrients). CVD Risk Factor Measurements CVD risk factors are routinely measured at all Framing- ham exams ( 29) according to extensively published and validated methods ( 29-33 ) and were interpreted accord- ing to Framingham protocols, and using existing expertstandards ( 4,6,7,34,35 ). Analysis Once the men's ve dietary patterns were identied, the primary research aim was to examine associations be-tween these dietary patterns and levels of nutrient in-take, overall nutritional risk, and CVD risk proles overfollow-up. The age-adjusted mean levels of macro- andmicronutrients and other dietary components as well asCVD risk factor characteristics were computed for eachcluster of men at each time point. Analysis of covariancewas used for calculating the least square means of con-tinuous variables using the SAS procedure PROC GLM(36). For categorical variables, age-adjusted proportions were computed using logistic regression (PROC LOGIS-TIC) ( 36). From the logistic regression, we used the /H110022 log-likelihood to test the overall difference among the vedietary patterns groups. If the difference was signicantoverall ( P/H11021.05) or approached signicance (.05 /H11021P/H11021.10), we compared each group with the referent group (thegroup with either lowest or highest prevalence rate), ad-justing for overall Type 1 error ( 37). We evaluated the stability of the dietary patterns by comparing the com-posite nutritional risk rank score of each male subject atbaseline and 8 years of follow-up using the SpearmanRank correlation statistic ( 36,38 ). RESULTS We identied ve nonoverlapping subgroups of men in the Framingham population, each of which had distinctive di-etary patterns. Table 1 summarizes the age-adjusted mean daily intakes of the 13 clustered food groups bydietary pattern subgroup. We descriptively labeled eachsubgroup of men to reflect the unique features of theirdietary pattern: Transition to Heart Healthy, HigherStarch, Average Male, Lower Variety, and Empty Calo-ries. We note that men with the Transition to HeartHealthy dietary pattern had somewhat more favorablefood and nutrient intakes overall ( Tables 1 ,2, and 3), although all dietary patterns of Framingham men wereassociated with relatively high nutritional risk. The Transition to Heart Healthy group (n /H11005341; 20.5%of the sample) consumed higher levels of vegetables, fruits, shellsh, vegetarian foods, whole grains, oils, lower-fat foods, organ meats, sh, and soups; their dietary pat- tern also contained lower levels of rened grains anddesserts ( Table 1 ). The Higher Starch dietary pattern (n/H11005183; 11% of the sample) was characterized by higher intakes of leaner protein foods; caffeinated, low-energybeverages; rm vegetable fats; and comparatively higherlevels of and desserts. The Average Maledietary pattern (n /H11005216; 13% of the sample) was higher in unsweetened beverages (with and without caffeine),lower in leaner protein foods (including dairy products),and otherwise relatively moderate in terms of other foodgroups. Men with the Lower Variety dietary pattern(n/H11005503; 30.2% of the sample) consumed the lowest level of most food groups, including high-fat animal proteins,whole milk, animal and vegetable fats, and sweets butalso fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and oils. Men in theEmpty Calorie group (n /H11005423; 25.4% of the sample) con- sumed the highest levels of rened grains, desserts, high-fat animal proteins (including meats and mixed-proteindishes), whole milk, eggs, animal fats, sweets, and saltysnacks and the lowest levels of low- and nonfat dairyproducts. The age-adjusted mean macro- and micronutrient intakes and summary nutritional risk scores of the male dietarypattern subgroups at baseline and follow-up are contrastedinTables 2 and3; the nutritional risk scores at baseline and follow-up are compared in the Figure . The expert dietary guidelines ( 1-5,7,8 ), Recommended Dietary Allowances ( 39), and Dietary Reference Intake standards ( 40) (as appropri- ate) for each of the 19 nutritional components we studiedare noted in Tables 2 and3. Overall, the dietary patterns of men were associated with higher mean levels of total andsaturated fat and lower intakes of carbohydrates and berthan recommended by experts ( 1-8). Mean intakes of most micronutrients appeared adequate in all dietary patterngroups, although intakes of calcium, folate, and beta caro-tene were to current nutritionalguidelines ( 39-41 ). Nutrient intakes improved somewhat in all subgroups during 8 years of follow-up although energyintakes rose. Nonetheless, contrasting differences betweendietary patterns were stable over time ( P/H11021.05); notably, intakes of saturated fat, sucrose, dietary ber, starch, vita-min C, and selenium. Considering the summary nutritionalrisk scores, men with Average Male, Lower Variety, andEmpty Calorie dietary patterns exceeded those in the Tran-sition to Heart Healthy subgroup at baseline and follow-up(P/H11021.05). The Spearman Rank correlation (Rho [ /H9017]/H110050.44; 95% condence interval, 0.38 to 0.50) indicated a satisfac-tory level of agreement between the baseline and 8-yearfollow-up nutritional risk score of men and provided evi-dence that the nutrient contrasts among the dietary patternsubgroups remain reasonably stable over time. The age-adjusted mean chronic disease risk factor prole of Framingham men at baseline and 16 years of follow-upare presented in Tables 4 and 5. Consistent with high nu- tritional risk in all Framingham men, chronic disease riskfactor levels were high in all male dietary pattern sub-groups at baseline and follow-up. Mean blood pressure andlipid levels generally exceeded expert guidelines and, con-sistent with higher energy intake levels at follow-up, over-weight/obesity affected 67% to 81% of men at baseline and 1726 November 2005 Volume 105 Number 11Table 2.

Men in the Transition to Heart Healthy subgroup had lower total and low-density lipopro-tein cholesterol levels, rates of overweight, and smokingthan most other groups, but their mean glucose levels anddiabetes rates were somewhat higher. During 16 years offollow-up, only smoking rates improved in all male dietarypattern subgroups; treatment rates for blood pressure andlipids were considerably higher and diabetes rates morethan doubled. The contrasting differences in smoking rates,body mass index, and rates of overweight and obesity per-sisted over time among the male dietary pattern subgroups. DISCUSSION We identied ve distinct and nonoverlapping dietary patterns in Framingham men, each of which was associ-ated with differing and persistent nutritional and chronicdisease risk proles over long-term follow-up. These ha-bitual dietary patterns of men were comprehensive (asreflected in a diverse array of foods, not a single markerfood), and appeared to be stable over time. None of themale dietary patterns could be considered ideal from anutritional or health risk perspective. Although the Tran-sition to Heart Healthy dietary pattern was associatedwith somewhat more favorable food and nutrient intakesand chronic disease risk proles, even this pattern (likeall others) deviated substantially from expert nutritionalguidelines at baseline and follow-up. Consistent with thehigh levels of nutritional risk in Framingham Offspring-Spouse cohort men, many of their chronic disease riskcharacteristics worsened over time. Rates of hypertensionand lipid treatment, overweight and obesity, and diabetesrose dramatically over follow-up. Contrasts between thedietary pattern subgroups in smoking rates, body massindex, overweight, and obesity persisted over 16 yearsand new differences in lipid treatment emerged. None ofthe dietary patterns previously identied in Framinghamwomen ( 42) is ideal, either; they differ signicantly fromeach other in terms of food and nutrient intake, risk factor prole, overall nutritional risk score, and predictedrisk of developing disease. Compared with men, however,nutritional and biological risk of women is relativelylower. Our prior research in Framingham women indi-cates that dietary patterns predict the development ofoverweight in lean women and are associated with thedevelopment of carotid stenosis and the metabolic syn-drome. Given the higher nutritional risk that appears inthe subgroups of men reported here, our future researchis likely to nd comparably higher rates of development ofcarotid stenosis, overweight, and the metabolic syn-drome. The close associations between male dietary patterns, nutritional risk, and chronic disease proles suggest theimportance of targeted preventive nutrition interventionsto promote health in adult men. The comprehensive na-ture of the identied male dietary patterns offers distinct,potential foci for preventive nutrition education andcounseling. The importance of targeting the specic components of habitual male dietary patterns in nutritional interven-tions and health promotion campaigns is consistent withexpert reports ( 1,2,9-11,41 ), which stress, in part, that dietary patterns and food-based approaches to dietarybehavior change are likely to enhance the long-term ef-fectiveness of preventive nutrition interventions. A di-etary pattern strategy is also consistent with expert rec-ommendations that acknowledge the importance ofrecognizing distinct consumer needs, preferences, andcharacteristics (indeed, the characteristics of discretepopulation subgroups) when designing health messagesand behavioral interventions ( 41,43 ). The dietary patterns reported here suggest specic tar- gets for focused nutrition interventions. For example, thefavorable consumption of vegetables and fruits, legumes,whole grains, and low-fat foods in men with the Transi-tion to Heart Healthy pattern might warrant emphasis inhealth education and counseling. Nonetheless, the rela-tively high saturated fat intake associated with this pat-tern (albeit more favorable than other groups of men) alsoneeds attention. Recommendations could focus on meth-ods for reducing fat in these men's preferred food choices(lowering the frequency of consuming animal proteinsand high-fat dairy products) while sustaining their rela-tively high intakes of micronutrient-dense foods. The close associations between male dietary patterns, nutritional risk, and chronic disease proles suggest the importance of targeted preventive nutrition interventions to promote health in adult men. Recommendations for the Higher Starch dietary pat- tern could focus on retaining higher carbohydrate intakesbut replacing rened grains with whole grain alterna-tives. Furthermore, dessert recipes could be modied toreduce fats and sugars, leaner poultry choices might be Figure.

November 2005 Journal of the AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION 1731emphasized, and visible fat consumption could be tar- geted for reduction. Among those with the Average Maledietary pattern, a key strategy might be to lower fatintake by improving food preparation methods, reducingrm vegetable fats, and selecting leaner animal proteinfoods. Fruits and vegetables could also be discussed asmore healthful alternative choices. A key message for men with the Lower Variety pattern is increasing consumption of a broader range of foods,including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean ani-mal and vegetable protein foods. Men with the EmptyCalorie eating pattern could be guided to select lower-fatmeats and low- and nonfat dairy products, to utilize lower-fat cooking methods and ingredients, and to emphasize micronutrient dense snack and meal choices. The dietary patterns reported here also suggest that certain common nutritional goals may be important topromote health and reduce chronic disease risk in alladult men. There were high rates of overweight and obe-sity, 76% to 91%, as well as diabetes, 10% to 18%, atfollow-up. On average, blood pressure and plasma lipidlevels also exceeded expert guidelines in all male sub-groups. These characteristics suggest that most menmight benet from weight reduction; however, the di-etary patterns suggest that methods of weight manage-ment in men ought to consider the distinct food prefer-ences and choices of the male subgroups. Recent research on the efcacy of targeted approaches to lifestyle behavior change ( 44,45 ) support the imple- mentation of more focused, food-based nutrition interven-tions. For example, investigators have successfully uti-lized approaches that target a person's readiness tochange his or her personal health-related behavior, in-cluding physical activity ( 45). In a similar vein, the di- etary patterns of male subgroups could be used to developtargeted educational/motivational strategies for nutritionbehavior change. The characterization of dietary patterns in men in this report is consistent with emerging cross-sectional andlongitudinal research in other populations as well asother established cohorts of men. Huijbregts and col-leagues ( 46) applied cluster analysis to a dietary history methodology and characterized four dietary patterns of men aged 70 to 89 years who were involved in the Zut-phen Elderly Study: high alcohol and low carbohydrateintake; higher intakes of saturated and monounsaturatedfats and cholesterol; higher intakes of polyunsaturatedfats and ber and relatively lower saturated and mono-unsaturated fats, energy, and cholesterol (the \"healthydietary pattern\"); and high intakes of oligosaccharides. Incross-sectional analyses, the healthy dietary pattern wasassociated with more favorable levels of cardiovascularrisk factors. Farchi and colleagues ( 47) identied four dietary patterns of middle-aged men in rural Italy anddemonstrated a 4.7-fold lower risk for coronary heartdisease mortality among men with more favorable nutri-ent intake (particularly, higher polyunsaturated fat in-take). Dietary patterns of women have also been charac-terized and explored in relationships to disease risk andoutcomes ( 15,16,48 ). It is a limitation of this research that our observations were established in a cohort of men, the majority of whomare white residents of a western Boston suburban com-munity. This may limit the generalizability of our nd- ings. Nonetheless, we note that the Framingham modelsof CVD risk have been replicated and conrmed in manydomestic and international populations ( 49-52 ). Our data encourage further research on dietary patterns of menand their relationships with nutrient consumption andchronic disease risk. It also is important to demonstratein future research that nutritional interventions that tar-get the distinct habitual dietary patterns of men canpromote long-term changes in eating behaviors and im-prove chronic disease morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSIONS This research identies comprehensive, habitual dietary patterns of adult men and demonstrates their associationwith high and varying levels of nutritional risk andchronic disease morbidity. These relationships suggestthat preventive nutrition intervention strategies mightbe enhanced if the unique male dietary patterns wererecognized and utilized as a framework within which toinitiate and guide targeted changes in eating behavior forlong-term health promotion. Indeed, the unique and non-overlapping nature of the male dietary patterns observedin Framingham suggests that each male subgroup mightbenet from nutrition intervention strategies that ad-dress its unique dietary pattern and related chronic dis-ease risk prole.
