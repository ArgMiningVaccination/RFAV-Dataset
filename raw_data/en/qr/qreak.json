When: Dec 7 | 07:00 am - 08:00 am Activity: Breathwork Venue: Ocean Tent Flow style yoga can make you feel amazing, but you can also develop some pretty gnarly injuries. This class focuses on 3 vinyasa 'hot spots', places that new (and longtime) students often experience pain: The wrists, shoulders and lower back. For the first half of class, we will workshop key alignment points for some classic postures which compromise these parts of the body. Then we will put these principles into practice with a simple vinyasa sequence. The foundation of a yoga practice is Ahimsa, or 'do no harm' - to others AND to your own body. Flow style yoga shouldn't just be for the young and strong, but rather for dedicated practitioners - who want to be able to move intelligently for life. (This class is designed for beginners, all students who want to revisit the foundation of their practice, and teachers seeking tools for teaching basics classes.)

When: Dec 8 | 09:30 am - 10:30 am Activity: Meditation Musician: Murray Hidary Venue: The Trailhead With so much conversation about the importance of self-love, world peace, spiritual awakening, and healing, it seems hard to find the 'how.' How do we love parts of ourselves that hurt ourselves or others? How do we resolve our inner conflicts so we can participate in healing a divided world? How do we awaken to the divine within ourselves without bypassing our humanity? How do we heal traumaand the chronic physical and mental illnesses it can cause? Without the how, we wind up feeling helpless to live in alignment with the core values and desire for optimal health that most of us desire. Well, wait no longer. This workshop offers the 'hows' we've all been waiting for, sensible solutions that help you open your heart to even your most destructive 'parts' so that your divine Self can extend compassion to them while leading the way to wholeness. In this workshop we will learn about the Self, our parts and then experience healing through a guided meditation where we explore Internal Family Systems.

As we tap into the transformative nature of fire, we'll witness how everything is transmuted into the same substance, guiding us towards a deeper connection with ourselves and our surroundings.
