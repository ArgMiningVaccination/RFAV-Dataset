The policy will lay out a roadmap for disease prevention and health promotion in national programmes by combining the best practices of the two systems of medicine, bringing down the cost of treatment while harnessing the benefits of Ayush, a senior government official told ET. \"The final document, being jointly developed by the ministry of health, ministry of Ayush and the [NITI Aayog](/topic/niti-aayog)is underway and the policy is likely to be out soon,\" the official said. The plan is to co-locate Ayush centres at primary health centres, community health centres and district hospitals and step up investments in education at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and research under Ayush, on the lines of China where traditional medicine is taught alongside modern medicine. Under the policy, the government could also come up with guidelines to include Ayush medicines in various national health programmes and develop a credible research base to ensure the traditional medicine gets embedded with the modern medicine. According to the official, the aim of the integrative health policy is to bring best practices of modern medicine and Ayush systems together to provide inclusive, affordable, and evidence-based comprehensive healthcare to an individual and the community. The NITI Aayog is of the view that the integration of the two medicine systems will enable better utilisation of over 8 lakh registered Ayurveda, Yoga, [Unani](/topic/unani), Siddha and Homoeopathy practitioners in India and cater to the demand and supply gap in the medical health system in the country. It is believed that certain chronic and non-communicable diseases along with mild cases of viral infections like Covid and Influenza flu can be tackled with Ayush methods of treatment along with modern medicines for severe cases. \"Hence, the need for an integration to promote natural healing, wherever possible, and avoid unnecessary usage of strong antibiotics,\" the official added. Ayush is a traditional and non-conventional system of health care and healing which includes Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa and Homoeopathy. According to the [World Health Organisation](/topic/world-health-organisation), more than 80% of the world's population in over 170 of its 194 member states currently use some form of traditional medicine, such as herbal medicine, yoga, Ayurveda, acupuncture and acupressure, and indigenous therapies. Besides, over 40% of pharmaceutical formulations are based on natural products.
