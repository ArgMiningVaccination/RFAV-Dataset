In recent years, practicing this mindfulness has become a mainstream practice, and for good reason. According to Mayo Clinic, physicians recommend meditation to help their patients manage the symptoms of a wide range of conditions, from cancer to asthma and heart disease to insomnia. What Exactly is Meditation? When someone thinks of meditation, images of people sitting cross-legged on the floor chanting \"ohm\" may come to mind, but the truth is, it is simply the act of [quieting the mind ](/ebooks/holistic-wellness-programs-for-treating-addiction-and-mental-illness/)and focusing your attention on the present moment, and it can be done anywhere and in any position. During meditation, when conscious thoughts arise, they're simply acknowledged and then sent along like a leaf floating downstream. the practice has a number of far-reaching benefits for people in recovery. Meditation and Stress, Anxiety and Depression It's understood that stress and mental illnesses like anxiety and depression are major factors for substance abuse and relapse. Meditation is a potent stress reliever, according to [Journal of Substance Abuse](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818765/). The study found that practicing the holistic method reduced incidents of stress-related relapse among participants in an outpatient addiction treatment program. Meditation also helps the brain and body respond better to stress in general, further mitigating stress as a factor in relapse. A study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine found that mindfulness helps ease anxiety and depression, which are also associated with substance abuse and relapse. Dr. Elizabeth Hoge, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, notes that mindfulness helps [people recognize unhealthy thoughts and mindfully replace them](http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/mindfulness-meditation-may-ease-anxiety-mental-stress-201401086967) with those that are healthier. Becoming free of negative thought patterns is a major consideration in addiction treatment, because negative thoughts foster negative behaviors. Clarity of thought gained through mindfulness is associated with making better choices that positively impact life in recovery. Meditation and Cravings Regular meditation can have a [ big impact on cravings](/combat-common-relapse-triggers/) as well. Increased mindfulness leads to fewer negative automatic responses to cravings as practitioners learn to listen to their body and mind and respond to its cues and sensations with mindful awareness and deliberateness. As they learn to accept thoughts and feelings without judgment, evaluate their attitude and quiet the mind's chatter, it becomes easier to respond to cravings and other negative experiences in healthy and productive ways. Meditation as Part of a Holistic Approach to Treatment A large body of research points to the range of benefits of mindfulness in recovery. A high-quality treatment program that takes a holistic approach to treatment offers the best chances for long-term recovery. Beating an addiction isn't easy, but a holistic program that addresses issues of body, mind and spirit through various traditional and non-traditional therapies like meditation can lead to real and meaningful change and a better chance of successful long-term recovery.
