He is now fully vaccinated and we are so happy for him! We have had a few questions at the clinic and over the phone about what life looks like after the vaccine. We are sure everyone has heard the recommendations that folks that have had the vaccine continue to mask up and limit their contact with others and that is what we will do at the clinic. Regardless of your vaccine status, doctors offices and other healthcare setting will likely require masks into the FAR (at least a year or more) future and we will as well. This is to protect YOU since Carleton sees so many patients per day as well as to protect anyone in your family or our family that cannot yet receive the vaccine. It is important to remember that the vaccines are VERY safe and VERY effective and we would recommend everyone who CAN get the vaccine gets whichever type is offered to them as soon as possible, but we acknowledge that no vaccine is 100% effective and we know that not all of our patient population is eligible for the vaccine yet. That means we will continue to utilize all of our mitigation protocols (see list below) and we will expect all of our patients to follow them to protect themselves as well as us, so we can stay open and continue to help you be pain free and achieve your health goals. We are grateful that our patients have done such an amazing job staying safe and healthy this past year. Thank you so much for your support. Hang in there! Brighter days are around the corner for us all. See you at the clinic soon- Alpine Acupuncture This article was posted in [Uncategorized](https://www.alpineacupuncture.com/issaquah/category/uncategorized/) .
