Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka researcher Alicia Ibarra-Lemay from the community of Kahnaw\u00e0:ke, interviewed Mori psychotherapist Donny Riki from Aotearoa, to explore her practice of healing in relation to her own connections to the Ngpuhi and the Ngti Paoa. As granddaughter to Ina Tepapatahi, Patara Te Tuhi, Puahaere, and Haora Tipakoinaki, Donny carries the responsibility for healing in the sense of helping her people find their way back home after 186 years of colonial violence and rule in her homeland of Aotearoa. This chapter discusses the way she works with tngata whaiora (Mori people, seekers of wellness) and how the process of healing is conceptualized in her M\u00e3ori worldview.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-06-04", "cleaned_text": "Healing and Well-Being through Ongoing and Regained Connection to Self, Culture, Kin, Land and Sky [https://doi.org/10.3390/genealogy5020055](https://doi.org/10.3390/genealogy5020055) [Landin' the Spirit: Indigenous the increase| increase the energy the remembrance the hinengaro manako||From the mindfulness the longing| |Ka hua te wnanga||From the longing the fruitful learning begins|[Henare 2001](#B10-genealogy-05-00055)). They evolve together, and they produce not only the world we see around us but also the world within us, the world of our innermost thoughts and feelings, symbols and images, and dreams and fears ( [Morice 2003](#B16-genealogy-05-00055)). [Pere 1991](#B19-genealogy-05-00055)). She formally introduces herself my place of infinite belonging| |where I will (one day) join Ina Te Papatahi Patara||My ki te ao wairua hei into the spirit world at awa||Hauraki is our ia ki te ao wairua hei 64.||She also passed into the |E noho ana mua kei New Zealand| defines whakapapa as \"the genealogical descent of all living things from the celestial gods to the present time; whakapapa is the basis for the organisation of knowledge and development of all things\" (173). It is through whakapapa (family genealogical tree) that Mori identify who and where they come from, and how this links them to the natural world and creation stories ( [Edwards 2012](#B7-genealogy-05-00055)), which is central to understanding Mori Whiria mountain is considered Donny's fundamental ancestor\u2014the primordial foremother, before the creation and evolution of mankind ( [Pere 1988](#B18-genealogy-05-00055)). This is her centre of belonging, where the Ngpuhi iwi (tribes' people) established themselves and still reside as one with land and sea. Donny's whenua (afterbirth/placenta) is buried there, alongside the whenua of her mighty ancestors and her children. Her grandchildren's whenua will also be buried there, as well as her great grandchildren when the time comes, and so on. Whiria houses the Ngpuhi guardian spirits and the bodies of her ancestors ( [Marsden and Henare 1992](#B12-genealogy-05-00055)). The Hokianga harbour has produced an abundance of seafood; and native medicinal plants in the nearby forest provided ample nourishment and revitalization for many generations. It is an eternal obligation for Ngpuhi\u2014past, present, and future generations\u2014to protect and defend the mana (integrity and dignity), mauri (life force), and tapu (sacredness) [Marsden and Henare 1992](#B12-genealogy-05-00055)). They are guided by and preserve the intelligence of ancient proverbs, such as: \"Ko au te whenua, ko te whenua ko au; ko au te awa ko te awa ko au\" (\"I am the land and the land is me; I am the river and the river is me\"). 2. Mori Healing and the Importance of Maintaining Balance [Mead 2003](#B13-genealogy-05-00055)). [Durie 1988](#B5-genealogy-05-00055)). All four dimensions are important to keep the 'house' upright and stable. If one dimension is lacking, a person becomes unbalanced and subsequently unwell. For Mori, the wairua (life force and spirit) domain is considered the most essential requirement for well-being. A person lacking spiritual awareness is deemed to be kahup (spiritually blind) and prone to adversities in all aspects of their life. [Durie](#B6-genealogy-05-00055)( [1998](#B6-genealogy-05-00055)) further recognized that holistic wellness includes healthy connections with te tai (environment) and te ao hurihuri (social world). Understanding the interconnected kinship ties to forests, lakes, animals, and people affirms identity and belonging. In addition, research highlights the need for Indigenous communities to decolonize their historical narratives with the aim [Waitangi Tribunal 1995](#B29-genealogy-05-00055)). It is fair to surmise, therefore, that Mori need healing from the genocidal, ethnocidal, and ecocidal harms of colonization. 3. Continuing with a Story of Love [Lee](#B11-genealogy-05-00055)( [2009](#B11-genealogy-05-00055)) and [Edwards](#B7-genealogy-05-00055)( [2012](#B7-genealogy-05-00055)) asserted that prakau (traditional stories) like these, support making meaning of natural phenomena and the linking of events that are experienced in everyday life. Rain are the tears of Ranginui as he weeps for his love and as the mist rises from the earth, it is Papatnuku yearning and reaching out to be with him. And it is in this life force, this abundant nature, that everything is linked together. It is through the natural world that the links between man and ancestors are made. [Reed](#B22-genealogy-05-00055)( [2004](#B22-genealogy-05-00055)) added that, for the Mori, the land is an eternal source of life and spirituality from which they originate and how they connect to everything else. 4. The Greeting and the Beginning of the Interchange\u2014Symbolism of the Hongi [Henare 2001](#B10-genealogy-05-00055)). [Barlow 1991](#B1-genealogy-05-00055)). The breath imbued by the Atua (primordial ancestors) unifies the spiritual presence of the past, present, and future between two people, between two tribes, and/or between two cultures. 5. Making Relationship [Duran and Firehammer 2013](#B3-genealogy-05-00055)). This introductory phase takes time, practice, and patience unfolding over several healing sessions, and space needs to be made to honour these points of connection. [Durie 1998](#B6-genealogy-05-00055)). [Durie 1998](#B6-genealogy-05-00055)). Once this has been established, sessions begin and end with karakia (incantation or blessing). At the beginning, karakia shifts the space from noa (normal) to tapu (spiritually protected). Ancestors are invited to uphold the mana (authority and dignity), mauri (life force), and tapu (sacred seed) of whaiora. It calls to the Atua (primordial ancestors) for ease of mamae (spiritual and physical suffering) and supports whaiora to deepen into their intuition, wisdom, and light, which they may have been disconnected from. At the end of the session, karakia (closing incantation) is used to shift the space back to noa (normal). Ancestors are thanked and asked to take any pain and distress back to the spirit world. 6. Healing Space 7. Beginning a Healing Session [Mikaere](#B14-genealogy-05-00055)( [2001](#B14-genealogy-05-00055)) emphasizes that while forces of colonization disconnected and displaced Mori from their language, tribal land, familial links, and cultural ties, healing endeavours to restore these connections. These formalities are conducted in a standing position as a token of respect to ancestors and those who have passed on to the spirit world. 8. Processing Past Violence and Traumatic Experience [Barlow 1991](#B1-genealogy-05-00055)). [Mildon](#B15-genealogy-05-00055)( [2017](#B15-genealogy-05-00055)) further adds that women who experience sexualized violence have their mana (dignity), mauri (life force), and tapu (spiritual being) violated, which directly affects her whakapapa from the past and into her future generations. - Taha wairua: Sacred and spiritual lores of womanhood, pride, and authority have been severely desecrated by the violent disconnection from her Atua (primordial ancestors), spiritual beliefs, and ancestors. - Taha whnau: The connection to ancestors and future generations through the womb is broken, often prompting women to question their identity, purpose, and position within their whnau (family) and society. - Taha tnana: Physical harm to the body\u2014particularly the vagina, womb, abdomen, and breasts. Without appropriate spiritual healing, disease is believed to manifest in these targeted areas as somatizations in the form of endometriosis, fibromyalgia, PCOS, fibroids, cystitis, and mouth, or throat ulcers. - Taha hinengaro: Emotional overwhelm and distressing thoughts occur as mana and mauri are compromised. [Durie 1998](#B6-genealogy-05-00055)). 9. Going into the Healing Experience \"Gently closing your eyes, bring your attention to your breath coming into your body, just notice what you notice... letting go of the busyness of your day... and with each out breath letting go of the weight in your shoulders... and your neck... just soften the muscles in your face... relax your jaw... and just notice what you notice. Gently guide your attention to the sounds of nature... let go of making sense of things and just observe your experience as it is... Notice what you can hear... or anything you can smell... allow memories or thoughts to just be here if they arrive... allow your senses to heighten... Notice the rhythm of your breath gently slow... allow the weight of your body to fall into the centre of your being... and now we will invite our Atua to bear witness to your experience...\" \"Io nui, Io roa, Io te mataoho, Io te ruirui mai i \"Feel the presence of Tne Mhuta, Atua of trees and living creatures... and the source of root our connection... strong and secure... anchoring your feet to the earth like the ttara tree... Feel the connection to Papatnuku (Earth mother).... Feel the wairua (spiritual energy) of her heartbeat beneath you... stable, permanent, constant... breathe in her healing energy through the soles of your feet... give yourself permission to take as much as you need... Move your attention up your legs and into your thighs noticing how your body makes contact with the couch you are sitting on. Breathe gently into your pelvis... feel your belly slowly rise and fall... feel the presence of Tangaroa, Atua of the ocean and source of emotional turmoil... notice how your internal moana (ocean) is calm and relaxed right now.... Move your awareness to your chest and notice how it gently rises and falls... see if you can feel your heart beating... feel the presence of Rongomtne, Atua of peace and the realm of love and compassion... allow this feeling to wash over you... Gently moving your awareness up to your shoulders and your throat, feel the presence of Twhirimtea, Atua of the wind and the realm of expression... remember moments of how you feel when you speak your truth... Slowly bringing your attention into your face and resting on your forehead just between your eyes... invite the presence of Tnenuirangi, Atua of the sun and the realm of spiritual intelligence... notice how this energy centre opens up to new possibilities and ways of being... Now bring your attention to the very top of your head, feel the warm presence of Ranginui our Sky Father, healer and link to Io (supreme being)... Just notice what you notice in this moment... and just when you're ready... feeling relaxed and alert ... gently bring yourself back into the room...\" 10. Healing Narratives, Prkau, and 'Lensing' [Richardson highlight how conversations like these uplift people's dignity once they recognize how they have created safety and resisted violence, which is pertinent for healing in that it highlights the person's agency and activity as well as their reasoning behind it. Exploring the ways that the English language dismantles mana (dignity and integrity) mauri and tapu can help whaiora 'make sense' As the whare tapa wha suggests, Mori worldviews are holistic and healing extends beyond the limitations of talk therapies for wellbeing ( [Mildon 2017](#B15-genealogy-05-00055)). Working with the body physically 'processes' experience, while working within the spiritual realm 'integrates' it. Having family members and/or loved ones included in the healing journey is mostly beneficial, to bridge the spaces between the spirit, physical, and social worlds with significant others. [Smith and Wirihana 2014](#B27-genealogy-05-00055)). The framework requires continually lifting the veil to reveal the brutal reality of colonial violence for what it is. Brave [Heart](#B9-genealogy-05-00055)( [2003](#B9-genealogy-05-00055)) described these traumas as the \"cumulative emotional and psychological wounding over the life span and across generations\". [Duran and Firehammer](#B3-genealogy-05-00055)( [2013](#B3-genealogy-05-00055)) described this as \"deep soul wounds, transmitted from one generation to the next\". [Salmond 1985](#B26-genealogy-05-00055)). [Richardson](#B24-genealogy-05-00055)( [2016](#B24-genealogy-05-00055)) further agreed that prkau are the medicine that reinforces a sense of Indigenous belonging and identity as an antidote to cultural erasure. [Royal's](#B25-genealogy-05-00055)( [2008](#B25-genealogy-05-00055)) notion of 'ancestor lensing' further explores and filters points of connection to prkau for practical application. For example, Donny might ask things like \"so how do you think (your ancestors) might view this situation? Or, how do you think (he/she/they) might respond to it?\", or perhaps even, \"what guidance do you think (he/she/they) would give to your great-great-great-grandchild if they were facing the same situation?\". These types of enquiry link the past to the future by honouring ancestral bravery, strategy, and survival. [Richardson and Wade 2009](#B23-genealogy-05-00055)). Another way of acknowledging and reconnecting with these ideas is to access and engage in the rich sources of belonging that are available and reflected in Mori language, art, music, and landscapes as taonga tuku iho (gifts handed down by ancestors)\u2014timeless and epistemological truths ( [Edwards 2012](#B7-genealogy-05-00055)). 11. The Experiential Healing Ceremony [NiaNia et al. 2017](#B17-genealogy-05-00055)). This is known as mate Mori (Mori spiritual dis-ease). Donny appreciates that this is a highly specialized area and, in these cases, will refer whaiora to a tohunga (specialist healer). [Duran 2015](#B4-genealogy-05-00055)) caused by colonization, across time and across generations. The ritual itself is so powerful and meaningful, it only needs to be carried out once. [Barlow 1991](#B1-genealogy-05-00055); [Pihama 2001](#B20-genealogy-05-00055); [Te Awektuku 2003](#B28-genealogy-05-00055)). The lyrics are written as a powerful and expressive call for guidance, strength, and support from the Atua and ancestors; the cathartic cry is expelled from the womb, linking the past to the present and the present to the future. [Firman and Gila 1997](#B8-genealogy-05-00055)). Similarly, Sanskrit teachings may regard this as the activation or unblocking of the seven chakra points located in various locations throughout the body ( [Pond 2003](#B21-genealogy-05-00055)). Preparation of this healing ritual supports whine (women) to compose lyrics for their karanga. This requires an investigation into ancestral origins and tribal knowledge, and a confident level of fluency of the Mori language ( [Yates-Smith 1998](#B30-genealogy-05-00055)). Often kaumtua (elders) are consulted to advise or support this process. [Mildon](#B15-genealogy-05-00055)( [2017](#B15-genealogy-05-00055)), having its own unique advantages: - Marae: The traditional gathering house is abundant in carvings, art, and symbols that depict the tribal narratives of that particular iwi (tribes people). This is a useful place to begin tangible reconnections to cultural identity and belonging. - Urup: Tribal burial grounds are a powerful space to karanga in the physical presence of ancestors, particularly if the abuser has passed on and is buried there. The karanga may be a call for support from those who have passed on, or an angstfilled wail of pain and anger\u2014either way, the spiritual and physical suffering is laid down and left there where it belongs. - Awa: The mauri (life force) of the awa (water) flowing freely in a stream offer spiritual and physical cleansing. The tears of Ranginui that flow down the mountains and fill lakes and streams offer regeneration, renewal, and revitalization. Wading into the cool water while performing karanga signifies new beginnings and a sense of wholeness. - Maunga: The sacred mountain is likened to the nipple of Papatnuku as it provides iwi (tribes people) with nourishment, safety, and permanence. The top of the mountain is the closest point of contact to Ranginui and the highest perspective from which to view the nearby marae (traditional meeting house), the awa (sacred water body), and the urup (tribal burial ground). A Karanga from this position is a powerful cry of connection, triumph, and victory. 12.
