Treatment of patients with certain inflam matory disorders (immunomodulation): - Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP, a disease where patients do not have enough blood platelets), who are at high risk of bleeding or prior to surgery to correct the platelet count. - Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a disease with multiple inflammations of the nervous system of the whole body) - Kawasaki disease (a disease which result s in multiple inflammations of several organs) _________________________________________________ How does KIOVIG work KIOVIG belongs to a class of medicines called immunoglobulins. These medicines contain human antibodies, which are also present in your blood. Antibodies help your body to fight infections. Immunoglobulins ar e used in patients who do not have enough antibodies in their blood and tend to get frequent infections. They can also be used in patients who need additional antibodies for the treatment of certain inflammatory disorders. KIOVIG (Normal Immunoglobulin) Consumer Medicine Information KIOVIG CMI 30 November 2011 Page 2 of 6 Baxter The active component in KIOVIG, immunoglobulin, is isolated from the plasma of human donors. As required by the Regulatory Authority, the viral DNA testing procedures for finding out whether the collected bloods contain infectious viruses have been incorporated in the process. Possible viruses which may be present in the donated blood include hepatitis (A, B and C), hu man immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and parvovirus B19. Further viral inactivation procedure has also been included during the manufacturing steps in order to reduce a potential viral tran smission via KIOVIG administration. A three step viral inactivation/reduction has been applied during the manufacturing of KIOVIG. Despite the stringent measures, which have been put in place during the manufacturing processes, the risk of contamination by viral and other unknown agents cannot be completely eliminated. _________________________________________________ Before you are given KIOVIG KIOVIG should not be given to you: If you are hypersensitive (allergic) to immunoglobulin or to any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet - If you are suffering from an immunoglobulin A deficiency (lack of IgA antibodies), you may have antibodies against immunoglobulin A in your blood.
