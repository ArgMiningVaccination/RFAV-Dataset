Patients must have had an adequate peripheral blood stem cell collection before consideration for high dose chemotherapy . GERM CELL CONSULTANT ONLY PRESCRIPTION - BEFORE PROCEEDING THE CHEMOTHE RAPY PRESCRIPTION MUST BE COUNTERSIGNED BY THE SUPERVISING HAEMATOLOGY -5, -4, -3 Carboplatin AUC 8 / day (TOTAL = 24) IV infusion -5, -4, -3 Etoposide 750 mg/m2/day (TOTAL = 2250 mg/m2) IV infusion 0 Re-infusion of stem cells At least 1 x 106 CD34+ cells / kg body weight IV infusion For heavily pre -treated patients (usually > 6 previous cycles of standard dose chemotherapy) or those with EDTA creatinine clearance < 80 ml/min consider reducing carboplatin to AUC 7 /day (TOTAL = AUC 21) and etoposide to 600mg/m2/day (Total = 1800 mg/m2). Cycle frequency 28 days Number of cycles Maximum of 2 cycles Administration Carboplatin is administered in 500mL 5% glucose over 6 0 minutes. Etoposide is administered in sodium c hloride 0.9% (concentration dependent) and infused over 2 hour s. Consider using etoposide phosphate (Etopophos) due to high dose and therefore high volu me of fluid required. Pre-medication Antiemetics as per local guidelines Emetogenicity This regimen has severe emetic potential . Additional supportive medication Allopurinol 300mg OD for patients with a high tumour burden H2 antagonist or proton pump inhibitor if required. Mouthwashes as per local policy. Anti-emetics as per local policy . GCSF as per local policy Antifungal and antiviral prophylaxis as per local policy High Dose Carboplatin and Etoposide with autologous stem cell support Version 2 Review date December 2021 Page 2 of 5 Prophylactic antibiotics as per local policy Extravasation Carboplatin and e toposide are irritant (Group 3) Investigations - pre first cycle Investigation Validity period FBC 7 days U+E (including creatinine) 7 days LFTS 7 days Magnesium 7 days AFP, HCG, LDH 7 days Pulmonary Functions Tests (including transfer factor) 28 days CXR 28 days EDTA creatinine clearance 28 days Echocardiogram 28 days Where appropriate offer pre -treatment sperm storage . Investigations - pre subsequent cycles Investigation Validity period FBC 96 hours U+E (including creatinine) 7 days LFTS 7 days Magnesium 7 days AFP, HCG, LDH 7 days CXR 7 days Standard limits for administration to go ahead with first and second cycle Investigation Limit WBC > 3.0 x 109/L* Platelets > 100 x 109/L* Neutrophils > 1.5 x 109/L* Calculated CrCl > 50 ml/min Bilirubin < 1.5 x ULN AST/ALT < 3.0 x ULN Before proceeding with cycle one the supervising haematology consultant must be satisfied that the patient has adequate cardiac and pulmonary function. It is recommended that the palliative and supportive care team are aware of the high dose chemotherapy treatment and review the patient to advise about symptom management. Consider referral to a clinical psychologist prior to cycle one. Consultant decis ion to proceed with cycle two - minimum interval between cycles is 28 days or un til blood counts have recovered (* discuss with haematology consultant if blood counts have not recovered to these values at day 28 - it may be appropriate to proceed with the second cycle with lower counts than pre cycle one) . Version 2 Review date December 2021 Page 3 of 5 Dose modifications Renal impairment This schedule is contra -indicated if EDTA CrCl 100% 1.5-3.0 or 2.5-5.0 Consider reducing dose to 50 - 75% (consultant d ecision) > 3.0 or > 5.0 Consultant decision - high dose chemotherapy would not normally be appropriate for patients with significant hepatic impairment No dose modification required for carboplatin Other toxicities Do not continue with second cycle in the presence of any persisting grade 3 -4 toxicity. Consultant decision to prescribe cycle 2. Adverse effects - for full details consult product literature/ reference texts Serious side effects Death Myelosuppression Nephrotoxicity Ototoxicity Neurotoxicity Pulmonary toxicity Constipation, diarrhoea Stomatitis, mucositis Alopecia Nausea and vomiting Anorexia Other side effects Electrolyte disturbances Fatigue Deranged LFTs Significant drug interactions - for full details consult product literature/ reference texts Warfarin/cou marin anticoagulants : Avoid use due to elevations in INR. S witch to low molecular weight heparin during treatment. Carboplatin : Antibiotics: The renal toxicity of aminoglycoside antibacterials (e.g. gentamicin) and amphotericin. Aminoglycosides should be avoided. If aminoglycosides are prescribed, close monitoring of renal function and serum antibiotic levels is required. Clozapine: increased risk of agranulocytosis, avoid concomitant use Diuretics: increased risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity Nephrotoxic drugs : increased nephrotoxicity ; not recommended Version 2 Review date December 2021 Page 4 of 5 Phenytoin: carboplatin reduces absorption and efficacy of phenytoin Etoposide : Phenylbutazone, sodium salicylate and salicylic acid : may displace etoposide from plasma protein binding thereby increasing systemic exposure . Additional comments The table below can be used to define a prognostic score for patients considered for high do se chemotherapy. This can help inform discussions with patients and their family/carers about likely survival benefits from high dose chemotherapy: (Reproduced from International prognostic factors study group JCO 2010 28;4906 -11) ________________________________________________________ _____ ____________ ___ References Summary of Product Characteristics Carboplatin (Hospira) accessed 1 July 2015 via www.medicines.org.uk Summary of Product Characteristics Etoposide (Hospira) accessed 1 July 2015 via www.medicines.org.uk International Prognostic Factors Study Group.
