Intervention - Assessment of infants' and children's immunization status - On-site vaccinations or referral to vaccination providers - Additional interventions such as client reminder and recall systems, manual tracking and outreach efforts, or adoption of monthly voucher pickup schedules that require more WIC visits when vaccinations are not up-to-date Vaccination services may be provided in WIC clinics, or through collocation and coordination of WIC programs with other healthcare services. CPSTF Finding and Rationale Statement [CPSTF Finding and Rationale Statement](/media/pdf/Vaccination-Programs-WIC-Settings.pdf)for details including implementation issues, possible added benefits, potential harms, and evidence gaps. About The Systematic Review [Community Guide systematic review completed in 2009](/media/pdf/Vaccination-WIC-Settings-Archive.pdf)(15 studies, search period January 1980-November 2009). A more recent search for evidence (search period 2009-February 2012) did not identify any new studies to be included in the systematic review. This review was conducted on behalf of the CPSTF by a team of specialists in systematic review methods, and in research, practice and policy related to increasing appropriate vaccination. Summary of Results [CPSTF Finding and Rationale Statement](/media/pdf/Vaccination-Programs-WIC-Settings.pdf). The systematic review included 15 studies. - Overall, vaccination rates among children increased by a median of 10.5 [percentage points](/pages/glossary.html#pointchange)(8 studies with 10 [study arms](/pages/glossary.html#studyarm)). - One study evaluated the use of interventions used alone and found no effect. - The additional interventions most often used were monthly voucher pickup (5 studies) and vaccine administration on-site or in collocated healthcare facilities (4 studies). Summary of Economic Evidence [CPSTF Finding and Rationale Statement](/media/pdf/Vaccination-Programs-WIC-Settings.pdf). The economic evidence is based on three studies that looked at the childhood vaccination series (search period 1980 2012). Monetary values are presented in 2013 U.S. dollars. - Intervention cost per child per year averaged $17.77. The cost per vaccinated child averaged $67.96 (2 studies). - Cost estimates varied because interventions were for monthly voucher pickup programs that used different referral types or included additional monitoring. - The third study provided an incomplete estimate for intervention cost, reporting only the cost of assessment for age-appropriate vaccination status (range: $1.90 to $3.93). The higher cost was attributed to the addition of an on-site nurse. Applicability Evidence Gaps [What are evidence gaps?](/pages/evidence-gaps.html)) - How effectiveness are intervention when implemented alone? - What are the effects of collocating WIC and health care services, requiring monthly voucher pickup, or providing WIC interventions outside of the medical home? Study Characteristics - All of the included studies evaluated WIC programs in urban settings and populations.

American Journal of Preventive Medicine 2016;50(6):797-808. Analytic Framework Effectiveness Review When starting an effectiveness review, the systematic review team develops an analytic framework. The analytic framework illustrates how the intervention approach is thought to affect public health. It guides the search for evidence and may be used to summarize the evidence collected. The analytic framework often includes intermediate outcomes, potential effect modifiers, potential harms, and potential additional benefits. Economic Review No content is available for this section.

Search Strategies Effectiveness Review The CPSTF findings are based on studies included in the original review (search period 1980-1997) combined with studies identified in the updated search (search period 1997- February 2012). Reference lists of articles reviewed as well as lists in review articles were also searched, and members of our coordination team were consulted for additional references. Details of the original search (1980-1997) The following five electronic databases were searched during the original review period of 1980 up to 1997: MEDLINE, Embase, Psychlit, CAB Health, and Sociological Abstracts. The team also reviewed reference lists in articles and consulted with immunization experts. To be included in the review, a study had to: - have a publication date of 1980 1997; - address universally recommended adult, adolescent, or childhood vaccinations; - be a primary study rather than, for example, a guideline or review; - take place in an industrialized country or countries; - be written in English; - meet the evidence review and Guide chapter development team's definition of the interventions; provide information on one or more outcomes related to the analytic frameworks; and - compare a group of persons who had been exposed to the intervention with a group who had not been exposed or who had been less exposed. In addition, we excluded studies with least suitable designs for two interventions (provider reminder/recall and client reminder/recall) where the literature was most extensive. Details of the update search (1997- February 2012) The team conducted a broad literature search to identify studies assessing the effectiveness of Vaccine Preventable Disease interventions in improving vaccination rates. The following nine databases were searched during the period of 1997 up to February 2012: CABI, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, Soci Abs and WOS. Reference lists of articles reviewed as well as lists in review articles were also searched, and subject matter experts consulted for additional references. To be included in the updated review, a study had to: - have a publication date of 1997- February 2012; - evaluate vaccinations with universal recommendations; - meet the evidence review and Guide chapter development team's definition of the interventions; - be a primary research study with one or more outcomes related to the analytic frameworks; - take place in an high income country or countries; - be written in English - compare a group of persons who had been exposed to the intervention with a group who had not been exposed or who had been less exposed. In addition, we excluded studies with least suitable designs for two interventions (provider reminder/recall and client reminder/recall) where the literature was most extensive Search Terms - Immunization - Vaccination - Immunization Programs Economic Review The present review included studies that reported economic outcomes from the 2000 review (search period 1980-1997) combined with studies identified from updated searches (search period 1997- February 2012) within the standard medical and health-related research databases, Google Scholar, and databases specialized to economics and social sciences. The details of the two sets of searches are provided below. Details of the Updated Search (1997- February 2012) The team conducted a broad literature search to identify studies assessing interventions to improve vaccination rates. The following nine databases were searched during the period of 1997 up to February 2012: CABI, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, Soci Abs and WOS. In addition, Google Scholar and specialized databases (CRD-University of York: NHS EED, EconLit, and JSTOR), were also searched. Reference lists of articles reviewed as well as lists in review articles were also considered, and subject matter experts consulted for additional references. Search Terms - Immunization - Vaccination - Immunization Programs To be included in the updated review, a study had to do the following: - Have a publication date of 1997- February 2012 - Evaluate vaccinations with universal recommendations - Meet the evidence review and Community Guide review team's definition of the interventions - Be a primary research study with one or more outcomes related to the analytic framework(s) - Take place in a high income country or countries - Be written in English; and - Compare a group of persons who had been exposed to the intervention with a group who had not been exposed or who had been less exposed. Details of the Original Search (1980-1997) The following five electronic databases were searched during the original review period of 1980 up to 1997: MEDLINE, Embase, Psychlit, CAB Health, and Sociological Abstracts. The team also reviewed reference lists in articles and consulted with immunization experts.

In addition, we excluded studies with least suitable designs for two interventions (provider reminder/recall and client reminder/recall) where the literature was most extensive. Considerations for Implementation - WIC services provide opportunities for regular and ongoing contact with families who may have limited access or substantial barriers to vaccination services. - On-site or collocation of vaccination services can greatly enhance access. They require ongoing communication and coordination between WIC programs and healthcare providers to minimize missed vaccination opportunities and maintain continuity of care.
