In this article, we'll focus on Pitta dosha, and how to incorporate healing crystals into your lifestyle to help pacify and soothe a Pitta dosha imbalance. What Is Pitta Dosha? Pitta means \"that which cooks,\" and its associated elements are Fire and Water (picture lava flow or hot oil in a pan). This is the energy of metabolism, digestion and transformation. The qualities of Pitta are oily, sharp, hot, light, moving, liquid and acidic and individuals who are Pitta dominant will display physical and mental characteristics that also reflect these qualities. When in balance, Pitta dosha is exuberant and courageous, has sharp mental perception, takes the lead, and radiates with warmth and a strong willpower. Their body is often warm and muscular with oily skin and penetrating eyes. When out of balance, Pitta dosha is prone to short tempers, rage, a big ego and feeling \"hangry.\" When Pitta derails, physical illnesses related to the stomach and inflammation such as ulcers, gastritis, sore acne and liver infections are common. In Pitta dominant women, menstruation tends to be hot and heavy. Pitta dosha struggles in the heat and is prone to heated discussions and jealousy. Pitta also enjoys an active lifestyle, full of hardcore workouts and extreme sports. However, these activities can aggravate the fire in Pitta dosha too, so to pacify Pitta, their lifestyle needs to cool down. Healing crystals are great for pacifying Pitta when they need to cool down. Here Are 3 Cooling Healing Crystals to Pacify Pitta Dosha: 1.
