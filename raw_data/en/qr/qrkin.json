Needles and syringes should be sterile and disposable. A separate needle and syringe should be used for each injection. To prevent inadvertent needlesticks, safety mechanisms should be deployed after use, and needles discarded immediately in a labeled, puncture proof container. NEVER recap a needle. Steps to Take Before Vaccination 1) Perform proper hand hygiene 2) Ensure vaccine has been stored within proper range; check expiration date 3) Double check vial, dosage, content prior to drawing up vaccine contents 4) Dilute with 21 gauge or smaller needle and draw up and administer with appropriate gauge needle 5) Remove any air bubbles in the syringe, for safety needle of appropriate size 6) Ensure the proper size needle/gauge is being used for injection 7) Maintain aseptic technique throughout, clean rubber stopper on vial if prior to piercing the seal 8) Identify landmarks for proper placement (deltoid, anterolateral thigh, etc.). 9) Educate patient on vaccine administration Steps to Take During Vaccination 1) Ensure proper positioning of patient 2) Prep site with alcohol wipe, using a circular motion from the center to 2-3\" circle, allow to dry 3) Control limb with non -dominant hand, hold needle 1\" from the skin, insert quickly at 90 degree angle. 4) Inject with steady pressure for several seconds, withdraw needle at angle of insertion 5) Apply gentle pressure with gauze, bandaid, etc. Steps to Take After Vaccination 1) Properly dispose of materials Used needles should not be detached, recapped or cut before disposal Immediately after use, all used syringe/ needle devices should be placed in biohazard containers that are closable, puncture -resistant, leak proof on sides and bottom and labeled or color -coded Empty or expired vaccine vials are considered medical waste and should be disposed of in appropriate containers Indiana Department of Health | Vaccine Safety and Administration Toolkit | www.in.gov/isdh/17094.htm 18 2) Fully document as directed noting the LOT number, date, manufacturer, etc. 3) Record vaccine administration into Zotec (Phase 1A) or Accenture. Indiana Department of Health | Vaccine Safety and Administration Toolkit | www.in.gov/isdh/17094.htm 19 Shoulder dysfunction is caused by injury to the musculoskeletal structures of the shoulder including tendons, ligaments, bursae, etc. after the administration of a vaccine. Known as SIRVA (Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration), this injury may induce shoulder pain and limit range of motion, weakness, and loss of function. In some cases, these issues may become chronic conditions for the patient. These symptoms are likely to occur because of unintentional injection of vaccine antigen, trauma from the injection, or in relation to the needle being inserted into the underlying bursa of the shoulder, resulting in an inflammatory reaction. Proper vaccination technique is key to prevent shoulder dysfunction. The Right Site: Find the boney part of the shoulder (acromion process), move your finger down approximately 2\" to the center of the deltoid, and administer the injection at a 90 -degree -angle to the skin. It is best to be seated when giving a vaccine or be standing at the same level as the patient. Inflammatory issues may arise even if vaccine is administered correctly, however, proper technique will ensure this is not cause by the provider administering the vaccine.

(2020). Reporting to the Vaccine Adverse Reporting System (VAERS). Retrieved from https://www2.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/ covid19/ SHVA/40020.asp Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Overview VAERS serves as the nation's early warning system to detect possible safety issues with U.S. vaccines. VAERS traditionally had provided initial data on the safety profile of new vaccines when they are introduced for use in the population. Creation of VAERS The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires health care personnel and vaccine manufacturers to report to VAERS specific adverse events that occur after vaccination. The reporting requirements are different for manufacturers and health care personnel. Manufacturers are required to report all adverse events that occur after vaccination to VAERS, whereas health -care providers are required to report events that appear in the reportable events table on the VAERS website. In addition to the mandated reporting of events listed on the reportable events table, health care personnel should report to VAERS all events listed in product inserts as contraindications, as well as all clinically significant adverse events, even if they are uncertain that the adverse event is related causally to vaccination. General information on VAERS is available at this website . Specific information for healthcare providers is available here . You can also watch an informational video about VAERS on CDC 's YouTube Channel here . Reporting to VAERS is fully electronic and can be done using an online reporting tool or a writable PDF; instructions are available at this website. Purpose of VAERS The purpose of VAERS is to detect new, unusual, or rare adverse events that happen after vaccination. VAERS is used to monitor for increases in known side effects, identify potential patients risk factors for particular types of health problems related to vaccines, assess the safety of newly licenses vaccines, and detect unexpected or unusual patterns in adverse event reports.

The V-safe monitoring system will be used to monitor potential adverse reactions in healthcare worker and essential workers. The system uses contact information supplied in the registration process for COVID -19 vaccination of essential workers to conduct health checks via text and email. In the first week following vaccination, vaccine recipient will receive a check -in daily. After the first week, recipients will receive a check -in on a weekly basis for 6 weeks post vaccination. Active telephone follow -up will be conducted with a person reporting a clinically significant adverse event during any V -safe health check. A VAERS report will be taken during telephone follow -up, if appropriate. Source: CDC. (2020). V -safe After Vaccination Health Checker.

Emergency Use Authorization and Operation Warp Speed An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID -19 pandemic. Under an EUA, FDA may allow the use of unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical products in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life - threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met, including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. Pfizer -BioNTech Covid -19 Vaccine has been authorized for emergency use by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) for use in individuals 16 years of age and older. The emergency use of this product is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of the medical product under Section 564(b)(1) of the FD&C Act unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner. The FDA must ensure that recipients of the vaccine under an EUA are informed, to the extent practicable given the circumstances, that the FDA has authorized the emergency use of the vaccine, of the known and potential benefits and risks, the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown, that they have the option to accept or refuse the vaccine, and of any available alternatives to the product.

In traditional vaccine development timelines, manufacturing steps are carried out in a sequential basis, however, with Operation Warp Speed manufacturing steps are carried out simultaneously. This increases the financial risk, but does not compromise the safety of the vaccine. Please refer to this educational video from FDA on \"What is an EUA? \". Importance of Patient Education COVID -19 vaccines will be an important tool to help stop this pandemic. Willingness to accept the COVID -19 falls on a continuum. Many people will fall in the middle of the spectrum with a wait -and- see approach. A strong recommendation from a healthcare provider is one of the most important factors in determining whether or not someone gets vaccinated. Build patient trust by sharing clear, complete, and accurate messages about the COVID -19 vaccine . Information to Provide to Vaccine Recipients As the vaccination providers, you must communicate to the vaccine recipient information consistent with the Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers prior to administering the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID - 19 Vaccine and provide the following: FDA has authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine, which is not an FDA -approved vaccine. The recipient or their caregiver has the option to accept or refuse the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID - 19 Vaccine. The significant known and potential risks and benefits of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine, and the extent to which such risks and benefits are unknown.
