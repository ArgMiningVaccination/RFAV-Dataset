You're not alone. Amy Lin, founder of [sundays](https://dearsundays.com/collections/nail-polish), shared the same thought and even created a solution for it. For Lin, creating sundays meant creating non-toxic products in consideration of nail care fanatics, nail salon staff, and the environment. That means vegan, cruelty-free, vitamin-rich formulas that come together to create a range of stunning shades. Lin prioritizes the idea of nail care as self-care, an act of wellness for the mind and body which one can practice through a visit to sundays studios. Sundays' line of products not only include nail polish but also nail care necessities, including gel removal kits, pedicure kits, and cuticle serums. At sundays, you can expect to get a nail treatment in tranquility, including the option of listening to meditation while getting your nails coated with non-toxic nail polish, sundays' signature product. We had the opportunity to chat with Lin about her ideal nail colors for the winter season. From deep reds to creamy greens, see which color might spark your next aesthetic. First up is [No.02](https://dearsundays.com/products/no-02?_pos=1&_sid=81c949368&_ss=r), because everyone's go-to is a good neutral pink at one point or another. \"A semi-sheer light pink nude for that barely-there natural look, chic for your yoga class or office outfit, all-year round.\" Next, we have [No.17](https://dearsundays.com/products/no-17?_pos=1&_sid=e969d0fe1&_ss=r) AKA the perfect confidence boost. \"Deep red with cherry undertones that goes well with all your winter jackets + a reminder to own your confidence.\" [No.21](https://dearsundays.com/products/no-21?_pos=1&_sid=2555ac95a&_ss=r) is the perfect accessory to that cozy sweater\u2014at the office and for Sunday morning coffee runs. \"You can dress up and down with this grape purple. Pairs with a fluffy sweater to get that cozy look.\" If you're thinking of \"the perfect shade,\" you're probably thinking of [No.25](https://dearsundays.com/products/no-25?_pos=2&_sid=1053505fe&_ss=r). \"An earthy rose red that adds a natural feminine touch to an everyday look.\" Lastly, we have [No.30](https://dearsundays.com/products/no-30?_pos=1&_sid=3398c9b44&_ss=r) for those looking for that perfect balance between No.17 and No.21. \"A creamy olive green that compliments your zen attire, especially if you are an earthy tone person.\" You can find sundays studios across New York City and inside of Sage + Sound.
