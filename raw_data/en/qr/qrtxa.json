We can confirm that the Public Health (COVID-19 Vaccination of Health Care Workers) Order 2022 ceased on 19 June 2022 and was not remade. The workplace health and safety risk assessment model means that employers will need to conduct their own risk assessments and consider what vaccination requirements they will be putting in place for themselves and their staff. In doing this please consider the publicly available guidance regarding COVID-19 infection prevention and control located on the NSW Health website [here](https://www.cec.health.nsw.gov.au/keep-patients-safe/COVID-19/COVID-19-IPAC-manual) and clinical guidance and resources [here](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/communities-of-practice/Pages/clinical-guidance-and-resources.aspx).
