THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH* I do solemnly swear, in the tradition of Hippocrates, by whatever I hold most sacred, to bring the following oath and written covenant to fulfillment, in accordance with my power and my judgment: That I will dedicate myself to the Profession of Medicine. That I will lead my life and practice this Art with uprightness, honor, and compassion. That I will be just and generous towards others in this profession, and will aid them in need. In respect for those who have led me into the Paths of Medicine, I will lead those who follow me. With eagerness, I will learn from my fellow physicians and, with humility, I will share my knowledge with them. That I will dedicate my career to improving the quality of life for those who seek my assistance. I will ensure that my patients are completely informed about their medical care, and will respect their dignity and autonomy, in living and in dying. I will earn their trust and confidence and make certain to hold their best interest in highest regard. I will keep inviolably secret whatsoever I shall see or hear in the lives of my patients which is not fit to be spoken. That I will recognize the limits of my abilities and seek assistance of others when these limits are exceeded. I will be responsible to continuously improve my skills and endeavor to advance my profession by seeking new knowledge and by reexamining the ideas and practices of the past. 13 That I will promote the health and welfare of my community and actively strive to improve the quality and access to health care for all. In the presence of my teachers, my colleagues, my family, and my friends, I make these promises solemnly, fully, and upon my honor. Should I be true to this oath, may prosperity and good repute be ever mine; the opposite, should I prove myself forsworn. *This oath is a modification of the original. D.

ACCREDITATIONS The University of Central Florida is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). LCME (Liaison Committee on Medical Education) Accreditation Numerous organizations and associations are involved in the voluntary regulation of medical education in the United States. The primary accreditation organization for undergraduate medical education is the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (www.lcme.org ) is the nationally recognized accrediting authority for medical education programs leading to the M.D. degree in U.S. and Canadian medical schools. The LCME is jointly sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association. All state licensing boards in the United States require graduation from an LCME -accredited school to be eligible for licensure as an allopathic physician. The LCME has a three -step process for granting accreditation to new medical schools: preliminary accreditation granted prior to recruiting the charter class of students (granted to UCF College of Medicine on February 5, 2008); provisional accreditation, granted during the second year of operation of the Charter class (granted to UCF College of Medicine on June 20, 2011 ); and full accreditation, granted during the fourth year of the Charter class.

The technical standards for the M.D. degree are applied in concert with other policies of the university , including academic policies, academic standards established by the faculty, and student conduct policies. Standards in five areas must be met by all candidates: Observation, Communication, Motor Function, Cognitive Standards , and Professional ism. 1. Observation Candidates are reasonably expected to observe demonstrations and participate in experiments in the basic sciences; observe patients at a distance and close at hand; demonstrate sufficient use of the senses of vision and hearing and the somatic sensation necessary to perform a physical examination; and integrate findings based on these observations and to develop an appropriate diagnostic and treatment plan. 2. Communication Candidates are reasonably expected to communicate in verbal and written form with health care professionals and patients, including eliciting a complete medical history and recording 21 information regarding patients' conditions; perceive relevant non-verbal communications such as changes in mood, activity, and posture as part of a physical examination of a patient; establish therapeutic relationships with patients; and demonstrate reading skills at a level sufficient to individually accomplish curricular requirements and provide clinical care for patients using written information. Accommodation through use of a trained intermediary or other communications aide may be appropriate when this intermediary functions as an information conduit. 3. Motor Function Candidates' motor and sensory functions must be sufficient to diagnose and deliver effective patient care by consistently, quickly, and accurately integrating all data gathered through whatever sense(s) employed. Candidates are reasonably expected to perform physical examinations and diagnostic procedures, using such techniques as palpation, auscultation, and percussion; complete routine invasive procedures as part of training, using universal precautions without substantial risk of infection to patients; perform basic laboratory tests and evaluate routine diagnostic tools such as EKGs and X-rays; respond in emergency situations to provide the level of care reasonably required of physicians; and participate effectively in physically taxing duties over long hours and complete timed demonstrations of skills. 4. Cognitive Standards Candidates must have sufficient cognitive abilities and effective learning techniques to assimilate the detailed and complex information presented in the medical curriculum. They are reasonably expected to: measure, calculate, analyze, synthesize, extrapolate, and reach diagnostic and therapeutic judgments; recognize and draw conclusions about three -dimensional spatial relationships and logical sequential relationships among events; formulate and test hypotheses that enable effective and timely problem -solving in diagnosis and treatment of patients in a variety of clinical modalities; understand the legal and ethical aspects of the practice of medicine; and remain fully alert and attentive at all times in clinical settings. Problem -solving, the critical skill demanded by physicians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. 5. Professionalism Candidates are expected to demonstrate behavior and social attributes that enable the effective practice of medicine. Candidates are reasonably expected to demonstrate the judgment and emotional stability required for full use of their intellectual abilities; possess the perseverance, diligence, and consistency to complete the medical college curriculum and prepare to enter the independent practice of medicine; exercise good judgment in the diagnosis and treatment of patients; complete all responsibi lities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients within 22 established timelines; function within both the law and ethical standards of the medical profession; work effectively and professionally as part of the health care team; relate to patients, their families, and health care personnel in a sensitive and professional manner; participate effectively in physically taxing duties over long work hours, function effectively under stress, and display flexibility and adaptability to changing and uncertain environments; maintain regular, reliable, and punctual attendance for classes and clinical responsibilities; contribute to collaborative, constructive learning environments, accept constructive feedback from others, and respond with appropriate modification. Compassion, integrity, interpersonal skills, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admission and educational processes. All candidates are responsible for meeting acceptable standards for behavior and intellectual functioning. Only minimal accommodation is foreseen with regard to the professional section of the technical standards. B. ABSENCES / ATTENDANCE Students are expected to attend all scheduled hours of instruction. Mandatory session and participation requirements in modules and clerkships and remediation due to absence are determined by the Module/Clerkship Directors. The student will be held responsible for any material covered during the excused absence, but will be permitted a reasonable amount of time to complete any missed work. Recognizing that situations arise which require students to miss time from their module/clerkship responsibilities, the procedures presented below will be followed when absence is necessary: 1. Year 1 a nd Year 2 Modules Emergencies - Personal Illness, Family Illness, etc. If the absenteeism will result in the student missing a scheduled exam or mandatory module requirement, the student must e-mail or telephone the Office of Student Affairs to report his or her absenteeism on the first day of being absent. The student should indicate the nature of the emergency. The Office of Student Affairs will take whatever action is necessary and will notify the Module Director of the student's absence. If possible the student should contact the Module Director as well. Upon return the student absence form must be completed by the student. Scheduled Time Off (Conflicts, out of town meetings, personal requests, etc.) All modules: Students will submit a written request to the Module Director for permission to miss scheduled exams, module projects, or mandatory sessions. The request should be submitted at least one month in advance of the scheduled event. The decision to grant or deny the request and determine subsequent action will be at the discretion of the Module Director. It is the responsibility of the student to advise the Module Director if they are on probation or 23 experiencing academic difficulties. Consideration will be given for activities such as elected student representation to various committees, organizations, and personal request s. The student must provide any documentation requested to the Office of Student Affairs addressing absenteeism. Students who miss scheduled hours are expected to acquire the same level of competency as other students involved in the module/clerkship. 2. Year 3 Clerkships The University of Central Florida College of Medicine recognizes the primacy of the Core Clerkships as critical components of medical students' education.

CLASSROOM RESPONSIBILITY Students are responsible for maintaining classroom decorum appropriate to the educational environment. When the conduct of a stud ent or group of students varies from acceptable standards and becomes disruptive to normal classroom procedures, the instructor has the authority to remove the offending party from the room and refer the student to the Associate or Assistant Dean for Students for disciplinary action. M.D. students are held to a much higher standard of professionalism and mutual respect is expected. D. COMPLAINT POLICY UCF supports the right of students to file grievances, lodge complaints and make appeals in a safe enviro nment free of fear, retaliation, or other adverse consequence. The university has a number of offices and committees that are responsible for implementing the institution's established procedures for addressing written academic and nonacademic student comp laints. 26 In most cases, the recommended strategy for complaints of any nature is to ask the concerned individual to first contact the person or office most directly connected to the issue, unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. If the concerned i ndividual does not want to contact a faculty or staff member directly, he or she begins with the next highest level of authority, which typically is the department chair or director. If the problem or complaint is unresolved or the individual is not satisf ied with the resolution, he or she may file a written grievance or appeal. Specific procedures are included in specific sections of this Handbook and the Golden Rule . For additional information, please contac t the Office of Student Conduct. The Associate and/or Assistant Deans for Students are also available as a resource to students. E.

Operating Procedure for Applicants with Disabilities On occasion an applicant to the College of Medicine identifies a disability that may impact his or her ability to meet the Technical Standards for Admission, Progression and Graduation from the College of Medicine . When this occurs the following procedure will be adhered to: 1. The Director of Admissions will inform the Chairperson of the Medical Student Admissions Committee. Upon learning of an applicant with disabilities who has been made an offer of acceptance, the Director of Admissions will bring the applicant to the attention of the Associate or Assistant Dean for Students. 2. The Director of Admissions and the Chairperson of the Medical Student Admissions Committee will ensure that the applicant receives reasonable accommodations for the interview process. The Technical Standards apply to all applicants, and competitiveness 31 of applicants with disabilities will be judged on the same basis as other applicants who are interviewed. 3. Once an offer of acceptance is made and the scope of accommodation requirements has been determined, the Associate or Assistant Dean for Students in consultation with appropriate professional personnel will determine a reasonable course of action. For example, a student with dyslexia may require extra time for exams, enlarged print on exams and, on occasion, readers. These are reasonable accommodations and will be provi ded for the student. Each individual's impairment is different, each disability is different and accommodation needs will vary from case to case. 4. The Associate or Assistant Dean for Students will work in association with Student Disability Services to review the student's disability and recommend accommodations. This may include interviewing the student to explore reasonable accommodations to provide the student with the best opportunity for success. It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide appropriate professional documentation showing the nature of their disability and request accommodations. Students should note that reviewing and making a determination regarding accommodations can take time and should plan accordingly. Students with known disabilities must meet the same standards of academic performance as other students being considered for admission. Accepted students who have disabilities will be expected to achieve a comparable level of competency to that required of other students for progression and graduation. 5. Upon request, the Office of Student Affairs will provide recommendations to applicants concerning professionals who are skilled in conducting evaluations for individuals who believe they may have a disability. 6. Students who have been granted accommodations for examinations must formally request implementation of these accommodations in writing to the Office of Student Affairs for each examination at least ten business days prior to the examination.

The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar provides access to student records to faculty and administrative staff with a legitimate educational interest . Students have the right, under the Family Educational Right s and Privacy Act (FERPA), to inspect and review their educational records. Student records submitted to the college become property of the university and originals cannot be returned to students or released to a third party. Students may request to amend their records under the provisions outlined in the regulation. Requests to amend information in medical student records will follow the appeal process included in the university's Golden Rule . 3. Directo ry Information Some information, called \"Directory Information,\" may be released to third parties without the student's prior consent, unless the student files a written request to restric t directory information access. At UCF, \"directory information\" is the student's: Name Current mailing address Telephone number 37 Date of birth Major field of study Dates of attendance Enrol lment status Degrees and awards received Participation in officially recognized activities and sports Athletes' height and weight The university extends to students the opportunity to withhold any or all information, including \"directory information.\" To do this, students must complete the appropriate form in the College of Medicine Registrar's Office, requesting this information be withheld. The Golden Rule outlines the university procedures for confidentiality. For additional information on FERPA, visit the Department of Education Family Policy Compliance Office at: http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/index.html . 4. Transcripts Official UCF transcripts are requested using the new online ordering process. All currently enrolled students have access via the student portal at: https://my.ucf.edu . Telephone and e-mail requests are not accepted. Transcripts cannot be released if the student has a hold due to a financial obligation to the university. Transcript requests must include the student's signature, full name, identification number and the name and complete address of the person(s) or organizations to which transcripts are to be sent. If final grades or degree statement are need ed, a student may indicate that the transcript request is to be held until all requested data are posted. Official transcript costs for the M.D. program have been assessed as part of yearly fees; consequently, transcripts are provided to enrolled students at no charge. However, the transcript cost for other UCF undergraduate and graduate programs is $10 per copy effective January 1, 20 08. There is a t ranscript fee of $10 per transcript for requests made following graduation or withdrawal from the program. S. M.D. PROGRAM COURSE AUDITING The M.D. program at the College of Medicine does not permit auditing of modules. Modules are only available to students enrolled in the M.D. program. T. TIME LIMITATION OF PROGRAM Students enrolled in the M.D. program will have six years from the date that they start the program to complete it. Any exceptions due to extenuating circumstances must be granted by the Associate Dean for Students. 38 U. CRIMINAL OFFENSES WHILE ENROLLED Any student who commits a criminal offense while enrolled in the M.D. program must meet with the Associate or Assistant Dean for Students for a thorough review of the situation . It may be determined that the student can no longer be enrolled as a result of the criminal offense. Decisions will be made on a case -by-case basis. Incidents will be communicated between the Honor Council (aka Student Professional Conduct Council) and the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. V. STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN MEETINGS The College of Medicine supports student participation in local, state, and national meetings , when such participation does not interfere with a student's academic performance. Students may request financial assistance for such meetings through the M.D. Student Council or the UCF Student Government Association. If granted, financial assistance typically covers only a frac tion of the expenses, and the student is responsible for the remainder of the costs. Students are expected to request permission to miss required coursework in advance (see ABSENCES / ATTENDANCE section of the M.D. Program Student Handbook). I. ACADEMIC POLICIES A. FACULTY/MEDICAL LEARNER COMPACT (Adapted Directly from the AAMC) Preparation for a career in medicine demands the acquisition of a large fund of knowledge and a host of special skills. It also demands the strengthening of those virtues that undergird the doctor/patient relationship and that sustain the profession of medicine as a moral enterprise. This Compact serves both as a pledge and as a reminder to teachers and learners that their conduct in fulfilling their mutual obligations is the medium through which the profession inculcates its ethical values . 1. Guiding Principles DUTY Medical educators have a duty, not only to convey the knowledge and skills required for delivering the profession's contemporary standard of care, but also to inculcate the values and attitudes required for preserving the medical profession's social contract across generations. INTEGRITY The learning environments conducive to conveying professional values must be suffused with integrity. Students learn enduring lessons of professionalism by observing and emulating role models who epitomize authentic professional values and attitudes. RESPECT Fundamental to the ethic of medicine is respect for every individual. Mutual respect between staff, patients and learners, as novice members of the medical profession, and their teachers, as experienced and esteemed professionals, is essential 39 for nurturing that ethic. Given the inherently hierarchical nature of the teacher/learner relationship, teachers have a special obligation to ensure that students and residents are always treated respectfully. 2. Commitments of Faculty We pledge our utmost effort to ensure that all components of the educational program for students and residents are of high quality. As mentors for our student and resident colleagues, we maintain high professional standards in all of our interactions with patients, colleagues, and staff. We respect all students and residents as individuals, without regard to gender, race, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation; we will not tolerate anyone who manifests disrespect or who expresses biased attitudes towards any student or resident. We pledge that students and residents will have opportunities to fulfill personal and family obligations, to enjoy recreational activities, and to obtain adequate rest; we monitor and, when necessary, reduce the time required to fulfill educational objectives, including time required for \"call\" on clinical rotations, to ensure students' and residents' well-being. In nurturing both the intellectual and the personal development of students and residents, we celebrate expressions of professional attitudes and behaviors, as well as achievement of academic excellence. We do not tolerate any abuse or exploitation of students or residents. We encourage any student or resident who experiences mistreatment or who witnesses unprofessional behavior to report the facts immediately to appropriate faculty or staff; we treat all such reports as confidential and do not tolerate reprisals or retaliations of any kind. 3. Commitments of Students and Resources We pledge our utmost effort to acquire the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors required to fulfill all educational objectives established by the faculty. We cherish the professional virtues of honesty, compassion, integrity, fidelity, and dependability. We pledge to respect all faculty members and all students, staff, patients, and residents as individuals, without regard to gender, race, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation. As physicians in training, we embrace the highest standards of the medical profession and pledge to conduct ourselves accordingly in all of our interactions with patients, colleagues, and staff. In fulfilling our own obligations as professionals, we pledge to assist our fellow students and residents in meeting their professional obligations, as well. 40 4. Violations of Faculty/Medical Learner Compact Faculty or resident violations of conduct, as it relates to students, shall be relayed to the Associate or Assistant Dean for Students or alternatively, the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs. Violations of the standards of conduct by faculty as enumerated in the \"faculty -learner compact\" and in other University Policies shall be relayed to the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs. Violations by residents will be forwarded to the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs. B. MEDICAL STUDENT ADVANCEMENT/FACULTY EVALUATION 1. Policies, Procedures and Due Process The faculty members and director of each module or clerkship define the criteria for acceptable academic performance in their respective module/clerkship. Evaluation of academic performance may include, but is not necessarily limited to, measuring the student's knowledge, measuring how the student applies such knowledge to specific problems, evaluating the judgment a student employs in solving problems, and assessing the quality of the student's psychomotor skills, professional conduct, ethical behavior and interpersonal relationships with medical colleagues, patients, and patients' families. Individual Module or Clerkship Directors specify how performance on assigned work is related to the grading scale described below in a particular module or clerkship. The final grade assigned for the module is recorded on the official transcript. However, because the pre-clinical modules are organ -system based, and involve the integration of a number of traditional basic science disciplines, as well as clinical experiences, Module Directors will also record performance in discipline area subject s and performance learning objectives. When appropriate, the Module Director will use a temporary grade annotation of (T), instead of assigning a final grade, to indicate that the student's performance in one or more discipline areas falls in the conditional or unacceptable range. Similarly, Clerkship Directors may use a temporary grade annotation of (T), instead of assigning a final grade, to indicate that a particular student's knowledge, skill or professionalism is conditional or unacceptable in a particular area, even though the student's overall average fund of knowledge is excellent or good. These annotations are used by the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC) in its review of an individual student and in the development of a corrective course of action. 2. Grading Policy The College uses a letter system for the M.D. program where grades are assigned for overall performance in a given module or clerkship. Students' performance in academic course work is evaluated by assignment of grades of (A) Excellent Performance, (B) Good Performance, (C) Conditional Performance, in order of excellence. The (F) grade (Unacceptable Performance) is given to students who fail a module/clerkship, who demonstrate inappropriate professional behaviors, or who fail to attend or participate in required course activities. Other grade actions 41 include an (I) showing incomplete work, a (W) indicating that a student withdrew from the course, an (R*) followed by a grade showing that the student repeated the course (Grade Forgiveness), and a (T) used as a \"temporary grade\" for performance pending review by the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee ( SEPC ). The (T) is used when a stud ent has an overall passing grade but may require further study to strengthen their fund of knowledge in one or more subject areas in a module or clerkship . The (T) grade is replaced when remediation is successfully completed . Faculty may specify that some programs (selectives/electives) can be graded using a (P) pass / (F) fail or (H) h onors grade designation. All grade options for the program are subject to approval by the M.D. Program Curriculum Committee. The instructor assigns an I (incomplete grade) when a student is unable to complete a module or clerkship due to extenuating circumstances, and when all requirements can clearly be completed in a short time following the close of regular classes. In all circumstances where a student receives an (I), the student and faculty member must complete an agreement that specifies how and when the incomplete grade will be made up, which will be considered by the appropriate SEPC. All students receiving financial assistance (federal and institutional loans), will be cautioned that the terms of the assistance require that the (I) grade must be made up by the agreement date. Minimal competency in each module/clerkship is a composite score of 70 or above (A, B or C grade). A (T) entry identifies students whose performance, although within the passing range, requires study and re-evaluation in one or more areas within the module/clerkship. A (T) is used as a \"temporary grade\" for module/clerkship grades when students have achieved an overall score that would indicate a passing grade, but they have shown weak or marginal performance in one or more of the traditional subject areas that are included in the overall module/clerkship. The overall performance of students receiving a (T) in lieu of a grade is reviewed by the SEPC with the Module/Clerkship Director to determine how the student may improve their fund of knowledge in the identified subject area(s). The (T) grade is replaced by the final module/clerkship grade when remediation is successfully accomplished in knowledge, skills, attitudes and/or behavior. Unsuccessful remediation may result in a failing grade. Any incomplete academic work or work receiving a (T) grade must be completed withi n the prescribed period or the grade will be converted to an (F). 3. Evaluation Methods for Years One and Two Students are evaluated using multiple methods of assessment. Examinations are given at periodic intervals during the pre-clinical portion of the curriculum. The content and time of each examination is established by the Module Directors and coordinated by the Assistant Deans for Medical Education . The questions are generally multiple -choice and computer graded, but may include other formats (e.g. lab practicals) . It is the responsibility of each Module Director to establish the criteria for the awarding of module grades, the format of the examination, the role of examinations and other graded work in the determination of the grades, and the 42 communication of this information to students on the first day of each module. Any concerns relative to individual examination questions, criteria for module evaluation or final grades should be directed to the appropriate Module Director within ten business days of receipt/notification of the final module grade. Written examinations account for a major portion of the grade in most modules, but other evaluation methods including laboratories, small group and team -based learning activities and projects are also utilized and influence the final grade in each module. Students are expected to take examinations as scheduled. Students unable to take an examination as scheduled because of an emergency situation (e.g., illness, hospitalization or death in the family) must notify the Office of Student Affairs and the Module Director prior to the examination. 4. Evaluation Methods for Years Three and Four Student evaluation in the clerkship portion of the curriculum includes written examinations, as well as other forms of evaluation. The format of clerkship examinations may include multiple choice exams obtained from the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME), Objective Structured Clinical Exams (OSCE), simulation exams, or other formats. Some clerkships may use oral examinations administered by faculty, or faculty and house staff together. In addition, attending faculty and house staff evaluate clinical performance. It is the responsibility of each Clerkship Director to establish the criteria for the awarding of clerkship grades, and to communicate these criteria to students on the first day of the clerkship. Examples of these evaluation areas include: Patient Care - medical interviewing; clinical practice; procedural skills Medical Knowledge - fund of knowledge; clinical reasoning Professionalism - team relationships; humanism and ethics Interpersonal and Communication Skills Systems Based Learning Practice -Based Learning and Improvement - application of evidence; initiative and interest Students are expected to take examinations as scheduled . Concerns affecting individual examination questions or other forms of evaluation, as well as final grades, must be directed to the appropriate Clerkship Director, within ten business days of receipt/notification of the final clerkship grade. Evaluation of students in the selectives and electives may or may not include a written examination. The evaluation method is established by the Clerkship Director and is provided to the student on the first day of the rotation. All grades and evaluation reports become the permanent academic record maintained in the M.D. Registrar's office. 43 C. STUDENT EVALUATION AND PROMOTION COMMITTEE (SEPC) The following defines the composition, purpose, rules, and guidelines under which the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC) carries out its responsibilities. 1. Composition and Continuity The UCF College of Medicine has an individual SEPC for each cohort. The voting members of the committee consist of five core faculty representatives from both the basic sciences and clinical disciplines as appointed by the Dean. The committee also include s the Dean's staff members, module directors and clerkship directors as described below. The committee follow s its cohort or class through each of the four years of medical school (M-1, M-2, M-3 and M-4). The committee is identified by the anticipated graduation year of the entering cohort. A class entering in 2011 will be designated the 2015 Class. The intention is that the core faculty members on each committee follow a particular class through the program of study. This provide s the committee members greater intra -class continuity and insight into the abilities of the students and also promote s continuity from year one through year four for the class. In addition to the core faculty members, the directors of modules and clerkships in a respective curriculum year are also non-voting members of the committee for that curriculum year. The Dean appoint s the committee and the chair from the core faculty. The Assistant Deans for Medical Education and the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar support each committee . The Associate and Assistant Dean s for Students also serve on the committee. All are ex-officio, non-voting. The Knowledge Management System also serves as a comprehensive source of continuity. The College of Medicine legal office and UCF General Counsel's office provide legal support. Each SEPC is composed of the following: 1. Formal committee members as appointed by the Dean. These committee members follow a single class from year to year until graduation. 2. Dean's staff members, consisting of the Assistant Deans for Medical Education and the Associate and Assistant Dean s for Students , who follow all classes from year to year until graduation. 3. Module Directors (MD), years 1 and 2 and Clerkship Directors (CLD), years 3 and 4, who serve on each SEPC for the years in which they have responsibility for curricular modules and clerkships. 2. Continuity Across the Four Years for a Single Class Continuity across the four years for a single class is achieved by the presence of the Dean's staff (Assistant Deans for Medical Education , Associate and Assistant Dean s for Students and College of Medicine M.D. Registrar) and SEPC members who are present at every meeting over all four years of a cohort of students (intra -class consistency). 44 3. Continuity Across Separate Student Evaluation and Promotion Committees Continuity across separate SEPC representing different classes (2013, 2014, 2015, etc.) of students (inter -class consistency) is achieved by the presence of the Dean's staff (Assistant Deans for Medical Education , Associate and Assistant Dean s for Students , Associate Counsel and College of Medicine M.D. Registrar), Module Directors (MD), years 1 and 2, and Clerkship Directors (CLD), years 3 and 4, who are present for each year -1 class, year -2 class, year -3 class and year -4 class , respectively. The diagram presented below shows the SEPC composition for four classes over four years. It illustrates both the inter -class consistency (SEPC and Dean's Staff) and the intra -class consistency (Dean's Staff, MD, and CLD) . 4. Purpose The purpose of each committee is to systematically review the academic progress of each student within that curriculum year . The Committee also considers conduct and professional issues that may impact a student's academic progress or advancement. The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar coordinates all regular and annual meetings for the SEPC . Each committee will meet at least twice per year . Additional meetings can be called as required. At each meeting the Module/Clerkship Directors report on the academic progress of the students within their Composition of Student Evaluation and Promotion Committees (SEPC) 45 respective modules/clerkships and discuss any short -term remedial strategies currently being used with specific students. 5. Evaluation Process The SEPC regularly review s the academic , clinical and professional performance of each medical student. Students are reviewed at each meeting of the committee . Students who are experiencing academic difficulty may be referred to the Director of Student Academic Support Services. The student 's faculty advisor will also be notified. The SEPC uses the following process for evaluation and advancement : I. The SEPC shall review the academic and clinical performance of each medical student and make recommendations regarding advancement, graduation, probation, dismissal, remediation, leaves of absence, and re-admission. II. The committee will review the performance of students in academic difficulty, those students demonstrating a potential for being in academic difficulty, and those students who have exhibited unprofessional behavior or non-compliance with other standards of performance. The committee may recommend an improvement plan, may develop more comprehensive longer -term remedial plans for those students having difficulty, or implement appropriate disciplinary action, possibly including dismissal from the educational program. III. The committee will recognize the achievements of those students displaying exceptional or outstanding performance. IV. The committee chair will notify each student of the committee's recommendation regarding advancement or disciplinary action and provide the student with an opportunity to appeal that recommendation if they desire. V. The Dean makes the final decision regarding an appropriate course of action for each student. 6. Annual Evaluation Each student is reviewed annually by the SEPC to determine the student's preparedness for advancement to the next level of medical study. Students receiving all A and B grades for all modules or clerkships in a given year are normally advanced to the next year of study or recommended for graduation. Students with one or more C grades or annotation of T instead of assignment of final grade are reviewed by the committee to determine appropriate follow -up action which could include no additional requirements; completion of a particular module or examinat ion; repeating a particular module or clerkship; repeating a complete year; dismissal from the program , or other recommendations . The student may also be placed on a probationary status until required actions are completed. 46 Students with one or more F grades will be reviewed separately by the committee to determine their suitability for continuing in the medical education program. The committee may recommend remedial action requiring the student to retake a module/clerkship or repeat a year, or may recommend dismissal from the program. A student may appeal an SEPC recommendation if the student feels that the recommendation was not made in accordance with the advancement policy specified for the program or other requirements of continued enrollment or professionalism . Specific appeal procedures may be found on page 54. 7. Graduation Evaluation Each student is reviewed during the fourth year by the SEPC to determine the student's suitability for graduation. In conducting that review, the committee examine s the student's performance in the pre-clinical areas, clinical performance in the clerkships, and professionalism exhibited throughout the program of study . In addition, the committee verifies that all required examinations have been completed. 8. Procedures for Professional Conduct and Disciplinary Action Medical students are required to meet the behavioral standards for the College of Medicine and the university. The university policies and procedures concerning behavior are contained in the UCF student handbook, Golden Rule . Non -academic standards for behavior and conduct for the College of Medicine are embodied in the Student Honor Code . Reports of improper behavior and conduct will be addressed by the Honor Council (aka Student Professional Conduct Council (SPCC) ), which performs peer evaluation for issues of student professionalism and other conduct issues that are inconsistent with the values of the College of Medicine. The SPCC strives to educate the students in their professional responsibilities, to investigate any reported violations of the Honor Code, to recommend appropriate penalties, and to interface with the SEPC when breaches of professional conduct are suspected. The Honor Code and the policies and procedures of the SPCC are included in Appendix A. 9. Publication and Communication of Standards and Procedures These standards and procedures for evaluatio n, advancement and graduation and for professional conduct and disciplinary action are published in the UCF College of Medicine M.D. Program Student Handbook , M.D. Student Bulletin, and are posted on the web. Students and faculty members have access to an electronic copy of both documents. The location of these documents , as well as the standards and procedures contained within, are reviewed during the annual orientations required for all students and new faculty members. The responsibilities of the SEPC and the SPCC are delineated in the UCF College of Medicine M.D. Program Student Handbook . 10. Review of Student Performance A student's overall performance is considered by the SEPC in preparing recommendations regarding promotion, graduation and general academic progress. Information upon which 47 decisions are based include grades, written evaluations , and cognitive and non-cognitive data submitted by the faculty during various modules/clerkships. Students must receive a passing grade in every module, clerkship and course to be recommended for promotion and graduation. All students are informed of their academic progress on a regular basis. Any student with a deficient grade who is granted approval by the SEPC to remediate the deficiency must complete the required remedial course work with a passing grade within the permitted time frame. Remediation requirements are determined by the appropriate Module/Clerkship Director(s) and approved by the SEPC. Remediation must be completed prior to progression to the next academic year, unless the plan for remediation, submitted by the Module/Clerkship Director(s), and approved by the SEPC, allows continuation into the first months of the next academic year. Students with remediation requirements are expected to forego any optional summer experiences (e.g. r esearch opportunities, preceptorships, fellowship, etc.) in order to focus on their academic performance and successful remediation of deficiencies. Any incomplete academic work or work receiving a (T) grade must be completed within the prescribed period or the grade will be converted to an (F). Unsuccessful remediation may result in a failing grade. The (T) grade is replaced by the final module/clerkship grade when remediation is successfully accom plished in knowledge, sills, attitudes and/or behavior. 11. Confidentiality Proceedings of the SEPC are confidential. Except as specified in this policy, the meetings are closed to persons other than university representatives authorized by the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs . 12. Requirements for Quorum and Adoptive Action for the Committee I. A quorum for any regular or called meeting of the Committee shall be defined as more than half of the voting members. II. All actions of the Committee will require a simple majority vote of those voting members in attendance. 13. Actions of the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC) I. Each student is considered individually with emphasis upon quality of performance. The Committee may recommend continued pursuit of medical studies for any student who is justifiably assumed capable of completing the M.D. degree requirements within the established time limits. II. This Committee review s the progress of all students. III. The Committee reviews and determines : a. The promotion of a student from one year's study to the next. b. The certification of a student as qualified to graduate. 48 c. The placement of a student, when necessary, on a leave of absence for academic reasons, diagnostic evaluation, medical intervention or personal reasons. d. Disciplinary action for unethical and/or non-professional behavior or other misconduct when required. e. Other remediation as might arise during the course of the educational program. f. The dismissal of a student from the College of Medicine for academic or professional reasons. g. Re-admission of a student following a leave of absence. IV. The Committee has the authority to make recommendations in the following areas: a. The formulation of a remedial program. (The recommendations of the respective Module/Clerkship Director concerning remediation will be the primary consideration , subject to approval by the Committee .) These programs may include, but are not limited to: a. Requiring a student to be re-examined or re-evaluated in a module or clerkship, with or without a period of tutorial study. b. Requiring a student to receive academic support (e.g. from the Director of Student Academic Support Services). c. Requiring a student to repeat all or part of a year's work or longer, if necessary. d. Recommending a student be placed on probation. e. Reviewing all petitions following a Committee -imposed leave of absence, and recommending whether or not the student may resume medical studies. This must be docume nted in a letter to the student from the Chair of the SEPC. f. Reviewing and making recommendations concerning a suitable course of study following a Committee -recommended leave of absence. g. Other actions referred to the Committee for an individual student and not falling under responsibilities specified above. V. If the action recommended by the Committee is that a student takes a leave of absence, the student may appeal the decision as detailed in the section entitled SEPC Appeal Process. VI. The Dean will designate a Chair of each SEPC . The Associate and Assistant Dean for Students, Assistant Deans for Medical Education , Chair of the SEPC and the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar prepare the agenda for regular and called meetings. Written notification of Committee action(s) will be sent to the affected student from the Chair. The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar is the official records custodian and will monitor all letters pertaining to committee actions. Verbal discussion of pertinent Committee action(s) with the individual student to whom such actions apply may be presented by 49 the Committee Chair, Associate or Assistant Dean for Students, Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs or Assistant Deans for Medical Education . VII. All deliberations of the Committee are strictly confidential. Module or clerkship directors may inform appropriate faculty of decisions concerning student performance. Faculty must be apprised of the confidential nature of the information. D. ADVANCEMENT OF STUDENTS 1. Minimum Requirements for Advancement I. Year One to Year Two : For promotion, a student must obtain a passing grade in all required modules that comprise the Year One curriculum of the College of Medicine. II. Year Two to Year Three : For promotion, a student must have obtained a passing grade in all required modules that comprise the Year Two curriculum of the medical school . For the Class of 201 5, students must also take and pass the USMLE Step 1 for promotion . (For the Classes of 2013 and 2014, a student must take the USMLE Step 1 for promotion to Year Three and must pass USMLE Step 1 for graduation. ) See the M.D. Student Bulletin for more information. III. Year Three to Year Four : For promotion, a student must have obtained a passing grade in all required clerkships that comprise the Year Three curriculum and successfully passed the Comprehensive Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) , which is administered at the end of the year . 2. Requirements for Graduation Specific requirements for graduation by class can be found in the UCF College of Medicine M.D. Student Bulletin. I. A student must have obtained a passing grade (C or better) in all modules or clerkships and required educational activities of the established curriculum of the College of Medicine leading to the M.D. degree. II. In the future when transfer students are admitted with advanced standing from other LCME approved schools, they must complete, at the minimum, the last two years of the curriculum at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine. III. All students must take the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and pass at the national standard in order to graduate. This examination is usually taken by all students in April following the second -year studies. In addition, all students in the Class of 2013 and 2014 must take the USMLE Step 2 CK and Step 2 CS examinations in order to be certified for graduation. Students in the Class of 2015 m ust take and pass the USMLE Step 2 CK and Step 2 CS in order to graduate. Students should take the Step 2 CK and the Step 2 CS examinations no later than December 31 in the fourth year. 50 IV. Students must have satisfactorily passed and completed the fourth year curriculum. V. The student must not have a financial obligation to the university . VI. The student must have satisfactorily demonstrated the professional attitudes and values expected of physicians. 3. Time Limitations for Completing Portions of the Curriculum I. A student must be eligible for promotion to Year Three of the curriculum within four academic years from the date of first matriculation. An exception to this policy may be made by the SEPC, such as for illness or when a student is involved in other programs of academic study (such as study leading to a graduate degree) or other exceptional circumstances. In these circumstances, a student must pass all required academic work for the M.D. degree. II. A student must be academically eligible to receive the M.D. degree at the regular spring commencement exercises of the College of Medicine, no later than the sixth year following matriculation, except for extended time granted as described above. E. STUDENTS WITH UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE/SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES Academic Failure, Probation and Dismissal 1. Academic Failure One Deficiency in an Academic Year A student who has one deficiency (F, I or T grade) per year will be required to remediate the grade successfully prior to promotion to the next year. A student with one deficiency and marginal performance in other courses may be required to repeat all or part of an academic year. When reporting a deficient grade, the Module/Clerkship Director responsible for that program will also make a recommendation as to how the student will remove this deficiency. The plan may include, but is not limited to, additional study time and taking a make -up exam, repeating all or part of the module or clerkship, or repeating the academic year. The recommendation is submitted to the SEPC for action. If the student fails to prove competency or successfully remediate, the student will receive an F in the module/clerkship and further remediation, if allowed, must be by repetition of the module/clerkship. Students are allowed to repeat a module/clerkship only once. A second failure in the same module/clerkship will result in dismissa l of the student from the College of Medicine M.D. Program. 51 Two or More Deficiencies in an Academic Year A student who has more than one deficiency (F, I or T grades) per year may be dropped from enrollment, or be required to repeat the entire year or a part of the year. The SEPC will determine a plan to resolve the deficiencies merited by the situation. Multiple Deficiencies During the M.D. Program A student who has had multiple deficiencies during enrollment will be assessed for the severity of the overall problem and a recommended course of action for the individual will be made by the SEPC. Consistency of performance is also evaluated. Any student who records two or more deficiencies (F, I or T grades) throughout enrollment in the M.D. Program will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the SEPC and may be subject to further SEPC action. Two or More Failing Grades During Enrollment in the M.D. Program A student who has two or more F grades during their year(s) of enrollment in the M.D. program will be subject to dismissal from enrollment in the College of Medicine M.D. Program or other academic action as deemed appropriate by the SEPC. Referrals to Counseling (Tutorial) and Study Skills Service Students are encouraged to take responsibility for their own learning and will be provided with formative assessment results throughout the curriculum . All students are encouraged to avail themselves of tutorial and study skills services without referral. However, when students are presented as having difficulty at an SEPC meeting, they are strongly encouraged to avail themselves of these services, and in some instances, will be directed to do so in writing. If a student is repeatedly urged to arrange tutoring, counseling or study skills help, but does not do so and subsequently fails a module/clerkship, this will be made known to the SEPC to assist in evaluation of the student's overall performance and professional attitudes. If a student is directed to seek these referral services, the student has a choice of utilizing UCF services or private resources. Module/clerkship representatives to the SEPC are responsible for providing the Committee with reports of referrals made by module/clerkship faculty as well as the student's utilization of referral services. Verification that the student has utilized these referral services may be required. In addition, the SEPC may require that the student have his/her tutor submit information and/or a recommendation to the SEPC relating to the student's academic program. The SEPC may, at its discretion, require an independent evaluation of a student believed to be suffering from an emotional or addictive disorder . Such independent evaluation shall be by a practitioner chosen by the College that is not involved in assessing the student's academic performance, and shall result in a report being forwarded to the College. In addition, students may be required to submit random urine drug screens at the request of the Associate Dean for Students or the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee. Students who 52 present with a substance use problem will be provided with referral information to the Professionals Resource Network (PRN) ( www.flprn.org ). 2. Probation Students may be placed on academic or non -academic probation. While on acad emic or non-academic probation , students are expected to limit their participation in extracurricular activities. In particular, students are not permitted to run for or hold any student officer or committee positions (including student organizations, the M.D. Program Student Council, Curriculum Committee and subcommittees, and the Student Professional Conduct Council). Students who already hold such positions at the time that they are placed on probation are required to relinquish the position(s). Additionally, the UCF COM will not suppo rt student travel for conferences or international experiences during probation. Exceptions may be granted under special circumstances by the Associate Dean for Students. Once the requirements for probation have been satisfied and the probationary status h as been lifted, the student will once again be eligible to participate fully in extracurricular activities, including holding officer and committee positions, as well as travel for conferences and international experiences. Academic Probation Academic probation is a designation given to students who are not performing adequately. It is a signal that the student is in danger of dismissal. A student who has been placed on academic probation will remain on probationary status until deficiencies are removed and/or any other requirements have been completed . Students are expected to resolve all deficiencies within one calendar year. During this period, the SEPC will continually review the student's performance. If any new deficiencies are recorded during this time, the SEPC will take whatever action is deemed appropriate for the individual student. Removal of academic probation will occur only when all deficiencies are removed and any other requirements have been completed . If a student has not been remove d from academic probation after one year, the student may be subject to dismissal from the M.D. program . I. A student who \"withdraws failing\" from the academic year to take a Leave of Absence shall be placed on academic probation. II. A student who is required to repeat an academic year will be placed on academic probation. III. A student who has one or more deficient grades (F, I or T grades) may be placed on academic probation at the discretion of the SEPC. Nona cademic Probation Nonacademic probation is a designation given to students who are not performing adequately outside of the learning environment. This designation applies to issues with professionalism and 53 other standards of behavior. A student who has been placed on nonacademic proba tion will remain on probationary status until deficiencies are removed and/or any other requirements have been completed . Students are expected to resolve all deficiencies within one calendar year. During this period, the SEPC will continually review the s tudent's performance. If any new deficiencies are recorded during this time, the SEPC will take whatever action is deemed appropriate for the individual student. Removal of academic probation will occur only when all deficiencies are removed and any other requirements have been completed . If a student has not been removed from academic probation after one year, the student may be subject to dismissal from the M.D. program . 3. Dismissal I. If, in the opinion of the SEPC, a student's academic performance does not meet the institutional requ irements for continuing enrollment, the committee will, at any regular or specially called meeting, recommend that the student be dismissed from enrollment in the M.D. Program . The student will be notified as soon as possible once this decision has been made. II. A student will be subject to dismissal if he/she has more than one F grade at any time, fails a module/clerkship while on academic probation, receives a deficient grade for a module or clerkship for a second time, fails to meet the requirements of remediation, or upon any other evidence of poor academic performance or deficient professional behavior as determined by the SEPC. III. A student whose performance, though passing, is borderline or marginal in several modules/clerkships will be subject to dismissal if the SEPC determines that the student does not meet the competency standards of the College of Medicine. Similarly, a student whose performance, though passing, consists of a record of multiple deficiencies or failures with subsequent remediation will be subject to dismissal. A student will be sponsored by the UCF College of Medicine for USMLE Step 1 and 2 for a maximum of three times each under ordinary circumstances. Following a third failure on USMLE step 1, the student will be dismissed from the M.D. Program . IV. A student may be dismissed from the M.D. Program if his/her professional behavior and ethics are not in keeping with the standards of the College. Graduation is predicated on the determination by the faculty, as recommended by the SEPC, that a student is suitable for the practice of medicine in terms of professional attitudes and values. The SEPC may recommend to the Dean of the College of Medicine dismissal of any student whose behavior is not consistent with the standards of the medical profession, or when the student's presence in the medical school is considered detrimental to the student in question, others in the College of Medicine community, or patients. 54 V. If there is a recommendation that the student be dismissed, the student may request in writing an appeal hearing before the SEPC within 10 business days of the time the original written decision was received by the student. 4. SEPC Appeal Process Appeal of Disciplinary Action or Dismissal by the SEPC A student may appeal an SEPC recommendation if the student feels that the recommendation was not made in accordance with the advancement policy specified for the program or other requirements for continued enrollment or professionalism . The student may be advised by the Associate or Assistant Dean for Students and College of Medicine M.D. Registrar regarding official policies. The written request for an appeal is direc ted initially to the chair of the SEPC for resolution by the committee and must be received by the chair of the committee within 10 business days following the student's receipt of written notification of the recommendation . The initial appeal is an informal procedure dealing with evidence of a student's performance and/or professional behavior and those factors applying directly to the student's ability to perform. An appeal hearing will be afforded before the SEPC at the student 's request (and no more than 21 calendar days from the date of the request) prior to deliberation or development of recommendations by the committee . A student has the right to present his/her case during the appeal hearing, but may not be presen t for any discussions or deliberation by the committee. If the issue is not fully resolved, then a formal written appeal stating the specific reasons that support the appeal must be made in writing to the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs within 10 business days after receiving notification of the SEPC recommendation regarding the appeal. After an appropriate review, the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs will recommend final disposition of the appeal. A student wishing to appeal to the Dean concerning the recommendation must make a written request within 10 business days of receipt of written notification of the recommendation from the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs. Acting as the university president's representative, the Dean of the College of Medicine shall make a final decision on the matter within 15 business days of receipt of the student's written request for review. The Dean may act on the appeal directly or choose to have the appeal heard by a special ad hoc committee appointed by the Dean. The Dean will make the final determination on the status of the student. The decision of the Dean is final and not subject to appeal. The student has the right to be present for any appeal hearing but may not be present for any discussion or deliberation by the committee. The student may be accompanied by a person or persons of the student's choice to provide support and counsel to the student. The supporting person(s) may not act as the student's attorney or otherwise participate directly in the 55 proceeding. If requested by the student, the Associate or Assistant Dean for Students may also serve as an advocate for the student in an appeal. Alternatively, the student may request that another faculty member, who is not a member of the SEPC, s erve as his or her advocate. That individual will be present at an appeal hearing only while the student is present, but may not be present for any appeal hearing discussion and decision. In the event student progression is delayed, a student will be assig ned to the present or adjusted year SEPC as is deemed appropriate by the present SEPC. 5. Petition for Re-admission Following Dismissal I. A student who has been dismissed from the College of Medicine and who is no longer enrolled may seek re-admission by written request to the Dean of the Colleg e of Medicine. Such requests require compelling data to support an argument for reinstatement and may be made no sooner than one year after the date of dismissal. II. Consideration of such a request, if accepted by the Dean, will be reviewed by an ad hoc committee of faculty members of the College of Medicine who are appointed by the Dean, to consider the ramifications of the request. That committee will make a recommendation to the Dean for consideration and action. The decision of the Dean is final and not subject to appeal. 6. Leave of Absence Students who are unable to continue enrollment or complete required instructional modules or clerkships due to illness, maternity leave of absence, hardship or special circumstances must immediately contact the Office of Student Affairs of the College of Medicine. A student requesting a leave of absence must submit a letter outlining the reasons for the request and timetable for return to the Associate Dean for Students . The Associate Dean for Students may approve a leave of absence for up to one calendar year. Any incomplete course work must be completed by the time specified in the letter to the student sent by the Associate Dean for Students. Leaves requested for a longer period are approved only in exceptional circumstances. Extension requests must be made in writing to the SEPC before the expiration of the original leave of absence. Note that for purposes of deferring repayment of student loans during a school -approved leave of absence, federal regulations limit the leave to six months. Students who are not enrolled are prohibited from taking part in the College of Medicine's formal educational programs, including classroom, laboratory, or clinical work. 7. Approval of Leave of Absence I. The Associate Dean for Students of the College of Medicine , or, in his/her absence, the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs, may place a student on a voluntary or involuntary leave of absence for good reason at the Associate Dean's discretion. If a 56 student disagrees with such action, he or she may ask the SEPC for a review which shall be conducted through the SEPC appeal process. II. A student in good academic standing without deficiencies may request of the Associate Dean for Students a leave of absence for a fixed period of time to conduct research or other scholarly activity. III. A student in good academic standing without deficiencies may request of the Associate Dean for Students a leave of absence for a fixed period of time as a result of a health problem or other personal circumstances that prevent concentration on academics. IV. If, in the opinion of the SEPC, a student who is experiencing problems is judged to be capable of completing the M.D. degree requirements within the established time limits, the Committee may recommend to the Associate Dean for Students that the student be placed on a leave of absence. This recommendation will be explained to the student. If a student accepts the recommendation, it will be implemented. If a student disagrees with the recommendation, he or she may appeal the decision through the established SEPC Appeal Process. 8. Petition for Re-admission Following Leave of Absence I. Student s on approved College of Medicine leave of absence must notify the Office of Student Affairs of the College of Medicine in writing of his or her intent to re-enroll at least one month prior to the date they wish to return to medical studies. II. Students who are on a leave of absence specified by the SEPC must fulfill all requirements specified in their letter from the SEPC prior to returning to medical studies. III. Students placed on leave of absence for an unspecified time period may maintain such status for a maximum of one year. In order to return to enrollment, the student must petition the SEPC in writing within the time period allowed. The SEPC will consider petitions for re-admission regardless of the reason enrollment was discontinued. When petitioning the Committee, the student must submit information that will show that return to enrollment is justified. This is required regardless of the reason for the leave. IV. Petitions for re-admission may be considered at any regular or specially called meeting of the SEPC. The time of re-admission will be based upon that which is deemed most appropriate to the student's academic status. Students may be required to repeat parts of the curriculum that have previously been successfully completed. 57 V. Re-admission may be denied if all available positions are filled, even if a student meets all other qualifications for re-admission. 9. Grade Appeal Process Basis for Appeal A student may appeal his or her exam or course grade if he or she feels that the grade was assigned in a manner not in accordance with the module or clerkship statement of policy distributed at the beginning of the module or clerkship. This is not a process for appeal of established module or clerkship grading policies. The appeal is directed initially to the module or Clerkship Director and then to the Assistant Dean (s) for Medical Education for resolution at an informal level. If resolution of the issue is not made to the student's satisfaction, then a formal appeal is made in writing to the Office of Faculty and Academic Affairs stating the reasons for the appeal. After an appropriate hearing and review, the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs will recommend disposition of the appeal. A student wishing to appeal to the Dean concerning the recommendation must make a written request within 10 business days of receipt of written notification of the recommendation from the Office of Faculty and Academic Affairs. Acting as the university President's representative, the Dean of the College of Medicine shall make a final decision on the matter within 10 business days of receipt of the student's request for review. 10. Guidelines for the Appeal Process of an Assigned Grade The following procedure provides guidelines for the grade appeal process. All persons concerned with this process should make every attempt to adhere to the time schedule outlined in the following description. Appeal to the Faculty Member I. Within 10 business days after the receipt of the grade, the student may submit a written appeal to the appropriate Module/Clerkship Director regarding any assigned grade that they dispute. This is an informal appeal. The Module/Clerkship Director will direct the appeal to the responsible faculty member, who will review the grading policy with the student to ensure that the process is understood and has been followed. If it is found that the assigned grade is incorrect in the judgment of the faculty member, he or she will initiate the appropriate change with the Module/Clerkship Director, who is then responsible for implementing a formal grade change. If the change is made at this point, the matter is concluded. II. If the faculty member concludes that the student's grade is correct as assigned, the faculty member will respond in writing to the student within 10 business days of receipt of the student's written request for review. 58 III. If the faculty member is no longer with the university, the student shall confer with the Module/Clerkship Director who will then make every effort to receive written input concerning the matter from the former faculty member. If it is not possible to receive information from the former faculty member regarding the grade, then the student may appeal the grade as described above and the Module/Clerkship Director will represent the interests of the faculty member who issued the grade. Appeal to the Module/Clerkship Director I. If the question of the assigned grade cannot be resolved between the student and the faculty member, the student may appeal to the Module/Clerkship Director. This appeal must be made in writing within 10 business days following receipt of the initial faculty member review. The student shall include all relevant information with the appeal to the Module/Clerkship Director. After receiving such an appeal from the student, the Module/Clerkship Director shall review with the faculty member the substance of the student's appeal and seek to determine its validity. II. If the Module/Clerkship Director determines that the assigned grade was in his or her judgment assigned in a manner not in accordance with the module or clerkship statement of policy, the Module/Clerkship Director will recommend to the faculty member to change the grade or pursue another appropriate remedy. If this action resolves the matter, the Module/Clerkship Director will initiate the appropriate changes. The Module/Clerkship Director will respond in writing to the student within 10 business days of the student's request for review. Appeal to the Assistant Dean (s) for Medical Education If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved with the Module/Clerkship Director, the student may appeal to the Assistant Dean (s) for Undergraduate Medical Education within 10 business days of receipt of the written decisio n of the Module/Clerkship Director. The Assistant Dean (s) for Medical Education will review all relevant information to this point and confer with the faculty member, student and Module/Clerkship Director. The Assistant Dean(s) for Medical Education will provide a written response within 10 business days of receiving a written appeal. If the student is not satisfied with the response from the Assistant Dean(s) for Medical Education and elects to continue with a formal appeal, copies of all relevant information mentioned above shall be sent to the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs. Appeal to the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs I. If the grade is not changed to the satisfaction of the student at the Module/Clerkship Director and the Assistant Dean(s) for Medical Education level, the student may appeal the assigned grade, in writing, to the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs. This appeal must occur within 10 business days of receipt of the written decision of the 59 Assistant Dean(s) for Medical Education . The appeal shall be prepared in writing by the student in consultation with the Associate or Assistant Dean for Students of the College of Medicine. The Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs may discuss the case with the student, the Module/Clerkship Director, the Assistant Dean(s) for Medical Education , the Associate or Assistant Dean for Students and the chair of the SEPC. II. Following these discussions, the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs may make a recommendation to the Module/Clerkship Director and the student. If this results in an acceptable solution to all parties, the matter is concluded. If not, a Hearing Committee will be appointed. The Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs may, if he or she chooses, appoint a Hearing Committee upon receiving the initial appeal. The appeal will be handled as expeditiously as possible by the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs. III. When the decision is made to establish a Hearing Committee to investigate an appeal, the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs shall convene an ad hoc committee comprised of three members of the faculty of the College of Medicine who have not previously been involved in issuing the grade or in the appeal process. This committee shall elect a chairperson and hold a hearing concerning the appeal at a time acceptable to all participants. At this hearing all material relevant to the appeal shall be presented by the student, the faculty member, the Associate or Assistant Dean for Students, the Assistant Dean(s) for Medical Education and the Module/Clerkship Director. Others may be requested to assist the committee. The student may request to have another individual present for support. Such supporting individual may not participate directly in the hearing. IV. The Hearing Committee will submit to the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs a written report containing a recommendation for a specific course of action regarding the student's grade appeal. If the committee cannot reach a recommendation, a written report will be submitted to the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs who will consider the reason(s) why the committee failed to reach a recommendation. Hearing committee reports are to be submitted within five business days. V. The Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs will then recommend a solution, which may or may not contain some or all of the recommendations of the Hearing Committee. If this recommendation satisfactorily resolves the matter, the issue is concluded. 60 Appeal to the College Dean If a satisfactory resolution is not achieved, the student may appeal to the Dean of the College of Medicine. A student wishing to appeal to the Dean concerning the recommendation must make a written appeal request within 10 business days of receipt of written notification of the response from the Office of Faculty and Academic Affairs. Acting as the university president's representative, the Dean of the College of Medicine shall make a final decision on the matter within 10 business days of receipt of the student's request for review. The decision of the Dean is final and not subject to appeal. F. ACADEMIC HONESTY GUIDELINES Academic Behavior Standards The University of Central Florida is committed to a policy of honesty in academic affairs. Examples of conduct for which students may be subject to academic and/or disciplinary penalties including expulsion are: Cheating : whereby non-permissible written, visual, or oral assistance including that obtained from another student is utilized on examinations, course assignments or projects. The unauthorized possession or use of examination or course related material may also constitute cheating. Plagiarism : whereby another's work is deliberately used or appropriated without any indication of the source, thereby attempting to convey the impression that such work is the student's own. Any student failing to properly credit ideas or materials taken from another has plagiarized. Unauthorized assistance : communication to another through written, visual or oral means. The presentation of material which has not been studied or learned, but rather was obtained solely through someone else's efforts and used as part of an examination, course assignment or project. The unauthorized possession or use of examination or course related material may also constitute cheating. Commercial Use of Academic Material : Selling notes, handouts, etc. without authorization or using them for any commercial purpose without the express written permission of the university and the Instructor is a violation of this rule. NOTE: A student who has assisted another in any of the aforementioned breach of standards shall be considered equally culpable. In cases of cheating or plagiarism, the instructor may take appropriate academic action ranging from loss of credit for a specific assignment, examination, or project to removal from the course with a grade of \"F.\" In addition, the instructor should refer the issue to the Honor Council (aka Student Professional Conduct Council (SPCC)), and may 61 request disciplinary action through the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities as outlined in Golden Rule . Please note: In addition to the Golden Rule , M.D. students are also subject to all College of Medicine policies as reflected in this M.D. Program Student Handbook. G. STANDARDS OF PROGRESS FOR VETERAN STUDENTS - M.D. PROGRAM 1. Unsatisfactory Performance As defined in the Academic Policies section of this Handbook, unsatisfactory performance may be subject to probation or dismissal from the College of Medicine. 2. Academic Probation As defined in the Academic Policies section of this Handbook, students may be subject to probation or dismissal from the College of Medicine if they do not meet satisfactory academic progress requirements . The decision for academic probation or dismissal is made by the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee . 3. Dismissal (Veteran Benefits) As defined in the Academic Policies section of this Handbook, benefits may be terminated for VA students who are dismissed from the College of Medicine . II. FINANCIAL POLICIES A. FINANCIAL AID All financial aid for M.D. students is processed through the College of Medicine Student Financial Services Office located in Suite 115 of the Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona. Please visit the Student Financial Services website to view cost of attendance, financial aid programs available, and other pertinent information regarding financial aid. 1. Financial Services Guidebook A comprehensive Financial Aid Guidebook is available online at Financial Services Guidebook . The staff of the Office of Student Financial Services has an open door policy and is always available to provide assistance and guidance in matters pertaining to financial aid. 2. Short -Term Advancements An interest -free advancement of up to $5,000 may be obtained to assist in short -term financial emergencies. The advancement takes approximately five days to process and must be repaid within 90 days. Anticipated financial assistance must be in place to cover the advance. Further information may be obtained from the Office of Student Financial Services or the Financial Services Guidebook . 62 3. Impact of a Leave of Absence or Withdrawal on Repayment of Student Loans For the purposes of financial aid, a Leave of Absence (LOA) is considered a temporary break in a student's attendance that cannot exceed 180 days within a 12-month period. The College of Medicine must report [to the lender(s) ] a student as \"no longer enrolled\" when the LOA exceeds 180 days. The student may be obligated to begin loan repayment after a six -month period or earlier, depending on loan type and date borrowed . The student is required to meet with a staff member from the Office of Student Financial Services prior to beginning a LOA to discuss student loan obligations during their LOA. If a student withdraws from the College of Medicine and received financial aid during their enrollment, they are required to attend a financial aid exit interview. During the exit interview, a staff member from the Office of Student Financial Services will advise the student about his or her rights, responsibilities, and loan repayment obligations for the financial aid he or she received. 4. Satisfactory Academic Progress M.D. Students at UCF College of Medicine who receive Title IV aid must meet the following Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). Institutional aid also requires the attainment of Satisfactory Academic Progress standards with exceptions determined by the Associate or Assistant Dean f or Students. Background All M.D. students are enrolled full -time while in attendance at UCF College of Medicine . Students proceed through the four years of study with class levels delineated at M1, M2, M3 and M4. Medical students' academic , clinical and professional performance is reviewed by the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC) on a regular basis. During the Annual Evaluation, each student will be reviewed to determine the student's preparedness for advancement to the next level of medical study. The M.D. program's academic term is equal to one academic year. M.D. students do not receive calculated grade point averages. Students receiving all A and B grades for all modules or clerkships in a given year are normally advanced to the next year of study or recommended for graduation. Students with one or more C grades or annotation of T instead of assignment of final grade will be reviewed by the committee to determine appropriate for followup action whic h could include no additional requirements; completion of a particular module or examination; requirement to retake a particular module or clerkship; repeating a complete year; dismissal from the program ; or other requirements . The student may also be p laced on a probationary status until required actions are completed. Students with one or more F grades will be reviewed separately by the committee to determine their suitability for continuing in the medical education program. The committee may require remedial action requiring the student to retake a module/clerkship or repeat a year, or may require dismissal from the program. (For more information regarding student 63 advancement, please review the Medical Student Advancement section of the UCF College of Medicine M.D. Program Student Handbook .) The outcome of each student's Annual Evaluation is shared by the Chair of the SEPC with the Office of Student Financial Services (SFS). In turn, at the end of each academic year, SFS determines if the student has met the Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP ) for eligibility for Title IV aid. A student who receives a grade of \"F\" will be on financial aid probation for the upcoming year of enrollment. Qualitative and Quantitative standards The maximum time frame to complete the four year medical school program is six years from the date that the student starts the program . Any exceptions due to extenuating circumstances must be granted by the Associa te Dean for Students. Students are expected to successfully complete each year so that they may advance to the next level. If a student does not successfully complete any one academic year, which prevents promotion to the next level, AND that student remai ns enrolled, then the student will be placed on SAP probationary status for financial aid purposes . The student may receive Title IV aid during the probationary year. At the end of that year (since the term is a full year) , the student's progress will again be reviewed, and if the SEPC determines the student successfully completed the year, financial aid probationary status ends. The student returns to good standing and may continue to receive Title IV aid. If, however, the student does not successfully complete the probationary year, the status changes from probationary to canceled, and the student cannot receive Title IV aid. Students on SAP probationary status will have this status noted in their academic record. Re-estab lishing eligibility If a student fails to be promoted after a probationary year, then s/he will not receive Title IV aid until such time as the student has successfully been promoted to the next level by the SEPC. If a student takes a leave of absence or withdraws and then returns to UCF College of Medicine , the student's SAP status will remain the same as when s/he left UCF. If the status is good or probationary, then the student can receive Title IV aid. Appeals We understand that illness, injury , death of a relative and other unfortunate or unforeseen circumstances that occur in the lives of students adversely affect their academic progress. For this reason, we allow students to submit SAP appeals that explain these mitigating situations. Support ing documentation must be submitted along with the appeal to the Office of Student Financial Services. Appeals are reviewed on a timely basis (within a week if possible) so that students can make financial decisions regarding their continued enrollment. 64 At this time, transfer students are not accepted at UCF College of Medicine , so until such time that this policy changes, we are not addressing transferred course work's impact on SAP. 5. Remedial Coursework - Tuition Tuition and fees apply to all coursework related to remediation requirements that are required during a typical enrollment period . 6. Leave of Absence - Tuition Exceptions to the tuition and fees policy can be made by the Associate Dean for Students in cases of leaves of absence and/or w ithdrawals. B. TUITION AND FEES/PAYMENTS Information about tuition and fees can be obtained from the College of Medicine Office of Student Financial Services, (407 -266-1383 ), or by visiting http://med.ucf.edu/students/financial/tuition.asp . The annual tuition and fees for M.D. students may change and therefore the best source for accurate information is: http://med.ucf.edu/students/financial/tuition.asp . M1 and M2 Students: First payment (50% of annual total) is due on the first day of orientation . Second payment (remaining 50% of annual total) is due on the first day of classes in January. M3 and M4 Students: First payment (50% of annual total) is due on the first day of clerkships in May. However, the payment can be deferred by anticipated financial aid. Second payment is due on the first Monday of January. The exact dates of the start of each medical year and corresponding due dates will be published as the academic calendar is published. Generally, classes in years M-1 and M-2 will start at the beginning of August. Clerkships in years M-3 and M-4 will start in May. A printed Billing Statement confirms fees and course registration. Billing Statements are available on the web at my.ucf.edu (student portal) once the student is enrolled in course work. All university fees must be paid by the published dates. Tuition and fees not paid by the payment deadline date for each term will result in late fees and could result in the cancellation of all classes. All expenses not covered by financial aid are due by the fee payment deadline. 1. Financial Aid Deferrals Financial aid awards will normally result in a deferment of tuition and fee payments. Deferments allow for the time lag that normally occurs between the date that tuition and fees are due and the date on which financial aid disbursements are made and enrollment can be verified , which is normally two to three weeks after the term begins. Students are responsible to pay any amount 65 owed to the university that is not covered by estimated aid and/or other resources by the payment deadline. The deferment process occurs automatically if the student is meeting all general eligibility requirements and has enrolled full-time in the M.D. program. Students should refer to correspondence from the Office of Student Financial Services, contact staff members within the Office of Student Financial Services, or utilize my.ucf.edu to obtain up-to-date information. Since awards are subject to change, deferments are also subject to change. Deferments based on estimated Stafford loans will be canceled prior to the beginning of the semester if the student has not completed the loan application process. Please communicate with the College of Medicine Director of Student Financial Services and the Registrar if enrollment plans or financial plans change during the course of your attendance as there may be important factors to consider . 2. Student Financial Responsibility Statement Registration at UCF College of Medicine requires students to acknowledge the following financial responsibility statement: \"I accept responsibility for payment of my tuition and fees by the published deadline. I understand that if I do not pay my tuition and fees by the due date I will be charged a $100 Late Payment Fee, my records will be put on hold, my account will be referred to a collection agency, and I may incur other financial consequences.\" 3. Past Due Accounts All financial obligations to the university must be met. Failure to meet obligations can result in the withholding and denial of registration, diploma, transcripts and readmission to the university . The services of a professional collection agency and recourse to the courts may also be invoked if deemed necessary. All costs of collection, including attorney's fees, are borne by the debtor. Do not assume your registration will be canceled if you fail to pay fees or attend classes. Tuition deferrals, for example, will prevent class cancellation for non-payment. a. Late Fees Late Payment Fees apply to students who do not pay (or obtain a full fee deferment) by the payment deadline. The Late Payment Fee is $100 per registration. Late Registration Fees are charged to students who enroll following the close of Add/Drop for the enrollment period, who re-register, or who enroll for the first time that period during Late Registration and Add/Drop. The Late Registration Fee is $100 per registration. b. Fee Appeals Students who desire to appeal a Late Registration Fee and/or a Late Payment Fee may make their appeal to the Fee Appeals Committee by initiating a student petition. Students must submit their petitions to the College of Medicine Office of Registrar or Office of Student Affairs and may appear before the Committee (not mandatory). Forms faxed to the Office of Student Affairs should be addressed Attn: Fee Appeals (407) 266-1389 . 66 c. Holds Holds due to unpaid tuition and fees that prevent registration and the receipt of transcripts will automatically be removed overnight once fees are paid. 4. Financial Aid Disbursements Financial aid disbursements begin the second week of each payment period (after enrollment can be verified). Students should be aware of this, so they are prepared to use their personal savings for anticipated expenses such as books and supplies at the beginning. A Short -Term Advance may be available for students to help with these expenses, but funds are limited and should not be relie d upon. The Short Term Advance application is available for download prior to each enrollment period, so that funds may be available prior to the first day of classes. Students who apply late for financial aid should be prepared to cover their own living expenses, out-of-pocket, well into the enrollment period. When financial aid disburses, the funds first apply towards university debts. The remaining balance is refunded to the student in one of two ways: via direct deposit or paper check. If a student has provided his or her bank information to set up direct deposit, which can be done on my.ucf.edu under UCF Student Accounts, then the refund is deposited into the student's account. Otherwise, a check is mailed to the student's current mailing address on my.ucf.edu . Please note paper checks take longer to process and there will be at least a three -day delay. 5. Direct Deposit Students are strongly encouraged to establish direct deposit with the university . Direct deposit prevents delays due to lost checks or change of address. All refunds from students' accounts can be directly deposited into their checking accounts. Funds are usually available within 24-48 hours after disbursement and enrollment only takes a few minutes. To enroll, sign in at my.ucf.edu and click on Student Self Service. Click on the Student Accounts icon, and then click on Direct Deposit and follow the instructions. Please note that efficient budgeting practices need to be implemented by students receiving refunds that cover their living expenses. Whether the refund is from loan proceeds or scholarship funding, it is important that students practice smart spending techniques. For further information, please contact the Office of Student Financial Services at (407) 266-1381 or (407) 266 -1383. 6. Payment Procedures If financial assistance will not pay the balance due on a student's account , then proper payment procedures must be followed. Payment must be received or postmarked no later than the fee payment deadlines specified to be considered on time. 67 If making payment at the Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona , acceptable forms of payment are checks only. However, there are several other ways to pay: Pay Online - the most convenient, especially for UCF medical students Credit card and check payments may be made online, through MyUCF E -Pay ( my.ucf.edu ). A mandatory, nonrefundable $10 convenience fee will be cha rged each time a student chooses to pay tuition or other state - mandated fees with a credit card through E -Pay. In-person by appointment at the Lake Nona campus, by e -mailing the College of Medicine Office of Accounting at com acct@ucf.edu . Main Campus 24-Hour Depository Location - you may pay by cash, check, money order or credit card at the locations listed. Please put PID (Personal Identification Number) on check or money order. Main Campus, MH 110 - (407) 823-2614 Main Campus, John T. Washington Center - 407-823-0829 Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona , Suite 115 - (407) 266-1381 (Please note, checks only. No cash or credit cards.) 7. Refund Policy Withdrawal or dismissal from the College of Medicine by the end of the week indicated will result in a full or partial refund as denoted below. Please note that this refers to classes, not orientation. Refunds for withdrawals or dismissals apply only to the portion of the year for which payment has been made. The date of withdrawal is determined by the date that the document of withdrawal is received by the Associate Dean for Students. The College of Medicine uses the university schedule for refunds. The schedule is as follows: end of first week 100% end of second week 75% end of third week 50% end of fourth week 25% fifth week or later no refund In the case of a medical withdrawal associated with a medical condition that prevents the completion of studies, a full refund of tuition and fees may be approved by the Associate Dean for Students. Refunds for medical withdrawals apply only to the portion of the year for which payment has been made. Consideration will be given for a medical withdrawal only when an illness or injury makes it impossible to complete a term. A medical withdrawal normally requires withdrawal from all instructional activities. Medical withdrawals will not be approved if the difficulty resulting from an injury or illness was present when the student enrolled for the term. A refund of fees will be processed under the conditions noted. The student must submit a written appeal for a refund or other appeal action to the Associate Dean for Students within six months of the close of the year to which the refund or other appeal action is applicable. Any 68 debts to the university will be deducted from the refund, up to the full amount. The refund amount depends upon eligibility as described below: A refund of fees will be processed automatically based on the date of receipt of the documentation of withdrawal by the Associate Dean for Students. Any outstanding debts owed to the university and the College of Medicine will be deducted from the refund, up to the full amount. Refunds for exceptional circumstances are determined by the college and are available up to 100% of tuition and registration fees. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, sickness, death, involuntary call to military service, or administrativ e error. Refunds for students receiving federal financial aid must adhere to the Return of Title IV Funds Policy noted below. Refunds for students receiving university -sponsored aid such as scholarships and grants are subject to the same refund policy. Therefore, if a student is subject to a percent refund of tuition due to early withdrawal, the same percent of gift aid will be refunded to the university. This includes institutional scholarships that cover living expenses. The earlier noted calculation will be performed within 30 days after notification of withdrawal or 30 days after the university becomes aware of the withdrawal. 8. Return of Title IV Funds Policy Students who withdraw after having received Title IV financial assistance might have to repay a portion of that assistance. If the student's award package includes any federal funds and the withdrawal occurs in the first 60% of the payment period, federal regulations require that a portion of the student's federal aid be returned to the aid programs. The portion of the aid to be returned is determined by a refund calculation that is based on the number of days remaining in the period. The return of aid is credited in the following order: Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan Federal GradPLUS Loan Other Aid Students who received Federal Stafford Loans should also know that the College of Medicine's Office of Student Financial Services is required to notify the lending clearinghouse and payments may become due . The repayment of aid may also apply to institutional aid. 69 III. HEALTH POLICY A. UCF HEALTH SERVICES Health Center, (407) 823-2701 Orlando Campus www.hs.ucf.edu All M.D. College of Medicine matriculating students are required to provide proof of current health insurance. Certification of current health insurance is required for each year of enrollment (see proof of health insurance form ). Recognizing the importance of lifestyle in health and the prevention of disease, UCF Health Services combines quality care for illness and accidents with an aggressive health education and lifestyle enhancement program. A Student Wellness Advocate Team (SWAT) enhances the health promotion efforts of the Recreation and Wellness Center. Acupuncture, biofeedback, massage and chiropractic care are available in the Health Center and Annex next door. Also, the Reach for Wellness program, located in the Recreation and Wellness Center, features comprehensive health assessment, nutrition counseling (with registered dietitians), HIV testing and counseling and workshops on topics ranging from sexual health to weight management to relaxation techniques. The Pharmacy fills your prescriptions and provides over -the-counter drugs and many convenience products to meet everyday health care needs. The Health Services program at UCF is accredited by the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC). Health Services is staffed by board -certified physicians, advanced registered nurse practitioners, physician assistants, registered nurses, pharmacists and a full complement of other medical support personnel. Laboratory and radiology services are also provided. The state of the art 50,000 square -foot Health Services building is centrally located on the UCF campus. Every health fee payin g student is entitled to the benefits provided through the University of Central Florida Health Services, which are outlined in printed material available at the Health Center or on its website at hs.ucf.edu . Medical conditions that require specialty care services are referred to specialists in the greater Orlando area or to specialists according to the patient's preference. Most office consultations and programs are provided without charge. However, laboratory tests, x-rays, medications, allergy maintenance (co-pay), flu shots, immunizations and some procedures and supplies require additional but significantly reduced payments, which may be made with cash, credit card, personal check, or charged to the student's account. An optional health and accident insurance plan by United Healthcare Insurance that is endorsed by UCF may be purchased by response to periodic mailers or by contacting the UCF Insurance 70 Office (407 -823-1649 ). This voluntary plan is separate from the health fee students are required to pay each semester. However, when purchased, the insurance will cover most of the Health Services charges and also provides for health coverage needs that are beyond the scope of the campus Health Services program, such as hospital referrals and specialty care (subject to co-pays and deductibles). Charges incurred outside the Health Center are the responsibility of the student, including transport by ambulance. In addition to access for clinical care services, the health fee entitles UCF students to use the Wellness Center located in the Recreation and Wellness facility. The Wellness Center recognizes the role of lifestyle in health and disease prevention by offering a wide range of health promotion services provided by professional health educators and peer health educators/advocates , including HIV confidential blood testing and oral HIV testing, biofeedback, nutrition and weight management, massage , and physical fitness and lifestyle assessment. When the Health Center is closed, students may obtain information and help from Health Services telephone message at 407-823-2701, its website (www. hs.ucf.edu ), FreeMD (the web -based interactive system to help make decisions about health needs) , a 24-hour Nurse Line at 800 -556-1555, or the Wellness Center at 407-823-5841. If the situation is urgent, students should call 911. In addition, UCF Health Services has a nurse practitioner available at the Lake Nona Health Sciences Campus (Silver Pod). The hours are Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, 1:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. (but are subject to change). Students are seen by appointment (although same -day appointments may be available) by calling 407 -823-2728. University of Central Florida Health Service (UCF HS) physicians with faculty privileg es in the College of Medicine (COM) and who have influence (evaluation, grading) on medical students academic progress shall not be available for the care and treatment of psychiatric, psychological or sensitive issues that may avail COM students. COM stud ents seeking care for such services at UCF HS will be directed to see other UCF HS providers as appropriate. See the appendix for the complete policy.

B. MANDATORY HEALTH REQUIREMENTS FOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE STUDENTS All College of Medicine M.D. program matriculating students are required to have completed a current physical examination and certain immunizations as required by the State of Florida and the University of Central Florida College of Medicine. Students are not allowed to register without proper health information and documentation. The Physical Examination and Immunization Forms must be completed by the attend ing physician and returned to the College of Medicine, Office of Student Affairs, at the address specified on the forms. The immunization form provides specific, detailed requirements of acceptable documentation. C. ADDITIONAL MANDATORY INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE STUDENTS All College of Medicine M.D. program students are required to have Disability Insurance and Professional Liability Insurance. Disability insurance can be obtained through the American Medical Association at a low-cost for M.D. students. An informational brochure along with other information regarding coverage can be found at Med Plus Advantage Program . A certificate of coverage will be provided to the Office of Student Affairs. While enrollment in this plan is not mandatory, proof of comparable coverage is required if the M.D. student decides to enroll in another plan . The Proof of Disability Insurance form must be provided to the College of Medicine, Office of Student Affairs. Certification of current disability insurance is required for each year of enrollment. Required Professional Liability Insurance coverage will be issued to students via a consortium agreement , and the cost is included in the M.D. tuition and fee assessment. 72 D. RECOMMENDED INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE STUDENTS It is recommended that all College of Medicine M.D. program students obtain Life and Accidental Death & Disability (AD&D) Insurance coverage. The American Medical Association provides M.D. students with low-cost options for both, life and AD&D insurance. E. EXPOSURE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS 1. OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen (BBP) Training for Medical Students At-Risk Introduction: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Bloodborne Pathogen Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030) applies to persons (students) who, in the normal course of his or her job, have the potential for exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials. Personnel who require this training include any person who, in the normal course of his or her job, has the potential for exposure to blood, body fluids, body tissues or sharps. A. Medical Student Training Requirements Students who require training - All medical students are at risk and must complete the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen (BBP) training upon enrollment and annually thereafter to meet OSHA BBP training standards. B. OSHA BBP Training Program Completing this web -based program meets both the initial and annual training requirements. Students are expected to complete the online course and quiz prior to the start of classes for the academic year. A score of 70% on the quiz is required for certification. Failure to complete the annual training course could have significant repercussi ons regarding your continued enrollment as a medical student at the University of Central Florida. Definitions: (taken from http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&p_id=10051 ) Standard (Universal) Precautions: is an approach to infection control . According to the concept of Universal Precautions, all human blood and certain human body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV), hepatits Pathogens (BBP): pathogenic microorganisms that are present in human blood and can cause disease in humans. These pathogens include, but are not limited to, HBV and HIV. 73 Contaminated sharps : any contaminated object that can penetrate the skin including, but not limited to, needles, scalpels, broken glass, broken capillary tubes, and exposed ends of dental wires. Workplace and engineering controls : controls (e.g. sharps disposal containers, self-sheathing needles, safer medical devices, such as sharps with engineered sharps injury protections and needleless systems) that isolate or remove the bloodborne pathogens hazard from the workplace . Other potentially infectious material s: (1) The following human body fluids: semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva in dental procedures, any body fluid that is vi sibly contaminated with blood, and all body fluids in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids; (2) Any unfixed tissue or organ (other than intact skin) from a human (living or dead); and (3) HIV -containing cell o r tissue cultures, organ cultures, and HIV - or HBV -containing culture medium or other solutions; and blood, organs, or other tissues from experimental animals infected with HIV or HBV. 2. Exposure Control Plan A. The Exposure Control Plan describes the rational e, policies and procedures, and the interventions available for College of Medicine M.D. students who have the potential for exposure to blood, other body fluids, or other potentially infectious materials during the normal course of their student activities. B. The College of Medicine and affiliated clinical education facilities have designated representatives who are charged to be a liaison between the College of Medicine and the Infectious Disease offices of affiliated clinical education facilities. C. Classes on prevention of exposure to infectious diseases and environmental hazards will occur at matriculation orientation and at the beginning of each academic year. Medical students will also receive specific training on use of personal protective equipment . Prior to beginning clinical work in setting with a risk for exposure, students will receive fit testing 3. Bloodborne Pathogens Policies and procedures concerning bloodborne pathogen exposures and exposures to communicable diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, chicken pox) are in place at each of the major clinical teaching facilities. During orientation programs an overview of procedures is presented. Familiarize yourself with the policies and procedures of each clinical facility and carefully comply with all requirements in case you are injured or exposed to communicable disease. 74 All needle sticks and other exposures to blood or other potentially infectious body fluids should be immediately reported to your supervisor and to the designated contact at the facility where the incident occurs. A. Routes of transmission BBPs can enter the body via needle stick, cuts with contaminated instruments or glass, or through abraded skin. They can also enter if a splash occurs on the eyes, nose or mouth. Some important things to remember about exposures: Needle size: Larger -gauge needles are riskier than smaller gauge needles. Needle type: Hollow -bore needles are riskier than solid suture needles. Needles with a syringe of fluid attached are more risky than needles alone. The following sequence outlines the likelihood of infection: Deep puncture with fluid injection > deep puncture without fluid > superficial puncture > superficial scratch with bleeding > mucous membrane exposure > non-intact skin exposure > aerosol of blood. Types of body fluid: Blood is the riskiest body fluid. Bloody body fluids are riskier than body fluids without blood. B. Risk awareness Remember: The greater the inoculums, the greater the risk. C. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) The amount of circulating virus in patient blood is highest when the patient has advanced AIDS and/or is experiencing acute anti-retroviral syndrome. Almost all seroconversions (presence of HIV antibody in the blood) occur when the patient is symptomatic with a high viral load or has advanced AIDS. Florida has the third highest number of adult AIDS cases in the US and the second highest number of pediatric AIDS cases. (http://www.doh.state.fl.us/disease_ctrl/aids/updates/facts/usfl.html ) In 1983, 240 AIDS cases were reported in the US; by 2003, 750,000 cases had been reported. Between 1993 and 2000, the number of people living with AIDS increased 119% in the southeast. 75 Through December 2001, the CDC received voluntary reports of 57 documented and 140 possible episodes of HIV transmission to healthcare personnel in the United States ( http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/bp_hcp_w_hiv.html ). The risk of acquiring HIV, if a positive source patient has HIV and the exposed person does not, is 0.3%, i.e., 3 chances in a 1000. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can be utilized within 1-2 hours post exposure. D. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) (http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HBV/HBVfaq.htm ) An estimated 800,000 - 1.4 million persons in the United States have chronic HBV infection. Healthcare personnel who have received hepatitis B vaccine and developed immunity to the virus are at virtually no risk for infection. For a susceptible person, the risk from a single needle stick or cut exposure to HBV -infected blood ranges from 6 -30% and depends on the H epatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status of the source individual. HBV can survive outside the body at least seven days and still be capable of causing infection. E. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) (http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HCV/HCVfaq.htm ) There are now over 3 million cases of HCV in the US; it is the most common chronic bloodborne infection in the United States. Highest prevalence groups include IV drug users, chronic hemodialysis patients, and recipients of clotting factor concentrates made before 1987 (when more advanced methods for manufacturing those products were developed). After infection, HCV may be clinically silent for years. After infection, 85% develop chronic Hepatitis C. Chronic HCV infection is the leading indication for liver transplants in the United States . Treatment is difficult to tolerate (pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 12 months). There is no preventive vaccine and no post -exposure prophylaxis. The risk of acquiring HCV, if a source patient has HCV and the exposed person does not, is approximately 1.8% . 76 4. Work Practice and Engineering Controls A. Sharps containers : Place all needles, syringes, sharps, broken or unbroken glass and plastic ware in red sharps containers. Label sharps container with biohazard symbol and user's address. Seal containers when three quarters full. B. Double corrugated boxes or large sharps containers: Are available for large contaminated objects such as suction liners. Must be labeled with biohazard symbol and address. C. Safer medical devices : Include retractable scalpel blades, needles with attached safety devices, blunted suture needles, retractable phlebotomy needles, needle -free IV systems, etc. These devices are to be evaluated and implemented, as appropriate, by each departmental area. Documentation of the evaluation and rationale for usage or non-usage of devices is required. 5. Hepatitis B Vaccination (http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HBV/HBVfaq.htm ) The Hepatitis B Vaccine is: Genetically engineered, non-replicative, safe and widely available . Given in a series of three injections: Day 0, 1 month, and 6 months, respectively , after the first dose. Post -vaccine quantitative titers are reco mmended at least 2 months post -vaccine. Prior to admission to the College of Medicine, all M.D. students must have begun or completed (including th e post -vaccine quantitative titer) the Hepatitis B vaccine series. 6. Personal Protective Equipment A. Gloves Are indicated when touching blood, bloody body fluids, and items or surfaces soiled with blood or body fluids. Inspect gloves frequently for holes, tears or deterioration. Double gloving decreases the chances of inoculation by 50%. Do not wash or reuse gloves. Wash hands after removing gloves. B. Face shields/goggles Indicated when droplets or splashes to mucous membranes are anticipated. 77 Goggles must have side protectors to prevent eye splashes. C. Gowns/lab coats/aprons Are indicated when direct contact with potentially infectious material is likely. Should be removed when leaving patient room/work area. D. Masks Are indicated when droplets or airborne transmission is likely. The N-95 disposable respirator mask is preferabl e. E. Handwashing Wash for 10 seconds with friction and lather if hands are visibly soiled. Wash after removing gloves and when leaving work area. Alcohol gel is an acceptable alternative to soap and water if hands are not visibly soiled. 7. Exposure and Post -Exposure Prophylaxis Through a waiver of the in-network requirements specified in the United Healthcare Student Health Services contract with UCF Health Services, BBP exposures and post -exposure prophylaxis can be obtained from immediate ly accessible medical facilities (both in-network and out-of-network) by medical students who are undergoing training in the clinical education environment in modules, clerkships, electives and selectives. Follow -up care for exposure must be obtained through arrangemen ts with UCF Health Services and their arrangement with in-network providers. Note: Students will be responsible for deductibles specified in the United Healthcare Student Health policy. A. Immediate procedure: Remove bloodborne pathogen. Sharps exposure - wash with soap and water. Students SHOULD NOT squeeze the affected area. Mucous membrane exposure - flush with copious amounts of water. Report exposure to immediate supervisor. Report within 1 -2 hours of exposure to the appropriate individual or office, based on clinical setting as below: General Procedures See below for information by clinical site. Hospital settin g during regular business hours Contact clerkship, module, elective or selective director. Inform resident or attending physician. 78 Report to Occupational Health in the hospital. Designations and follow up of exposures may be handled by different departments in affiliated facilities. In some cases, emergency room physicians may handle exposures. The director of nursing services or nursing supervisor on duty may be the first line of contact . Hospital setting during non -regular hours and holidays Report exposure to residen t and attending physician -follow their advice on obtaining treatment. Seek assistance from clinic or facility emergency room physicians if resident and attending physician are not immediately available. The director of nursing services on duty may be the first line of contact during non-regular hours. Other setting during regular and non -regula r business hours and holidays If HIV status of source is unknown, whenever possible rapid HIV testing will be performed on source. If exposure occurs during Health Services hours of operation and source HIV status is unknown, student will call Health Services at (407) 823 -2701 to speak with the medical director or his or her designee. If exposure occurs after Health Service hours of operation, or source is known HIV positive, student will proceed to nearest hospital emergency department for evaluation and treatment as deemed necessary. The student's clinical instructor and the student will report the exposure to the College of Medici ne. The incident, including the names of all contact points, will be documented by the Office of Student Affairs.

The Associate Dean for Students will provide assistance should you encounter difficulties and in informing and coordination of follow -up care with UCF Health Services. Contact: Dr. Marcy Verduin, Associate Dean for Student s (407) 266 -1353, marcy. verduin@ucf.edu Dr. M \u00e4nette Monroe, Assistant Dean for Students (407) 266 -1353, manette.monroe@ucf.edu UCF Student Health Services (407) 823 -2701 Assistance in obtaining evaluation, prophylaxis and follow -up care can be obtained through the Office of Student Affairs for the College of Medicine and UCF Health Services. Code names are used for all laboratory testing performed through UCF Health Servic es to assure confidentiality. 8. Decontamination, Disposal and Transportation of Biohazardous Material A. Blood spills Put on gloves. Remove any sharp objects with forceps. Saturate the spill with one part of chlorine bleach to ten parts water (make fresh weekly). 80 Let stand 15-20 minutes. Wipe up the spill with a paper towel. Discard gloves and paper towels into a red biohazard bag. B. Biohazard bags Red, biohazard bags are indicated for non-sharps waste that is contaminated and distinguishable from general waste. Red bags are to be 2-ply thickness and labeled with a biohazard symbol. C. Transportation of potentially infectious specimens Place the specimen in a sealed container (e.g. specimen cup, test tube). Place the sealed container in a secondary sealed container (e.g. freezer storage bag, plastic cooler) and line with absorbent material. Label the outside container with the biohazard symbol. Review: A. Always practice Universal Precautions - assume all blood, bloody body fluids and tissue are positive for BBPs such as HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. F. Obtain Hepatitis B vaccine and quantitative titer. G. If exposure occurs, wash or flush area, report incident to immediate supervisor and access health care within 1-2 hours of exposure. H. Remember the risk rule of three (the likelihood of getting infected with Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or HIV after an exposure) : Hepatitis B: 30% Hepatitis C: 3% HIV: 0.3% B. Use of Personal Protective Equipment Wear gloves to decrease inoculums from sharps injury. Wear gowns, face shields and gloves to decrease extent of mucous membrane or skin exposure. C. Elimination of risky practices Do not recap needles. Do not overfill sharps containers. Do not attempt invasive skills without training and/or supervision. Contain sharps and other contaminated waste in identifiable biohazard containers. 9. HIV / AIDS Policy and Other Infectious Diseases When an HIV infected individual comes to the attention of the university, whether student, faculty, or staff member, confidentiality of the individual as well as the individual's welfare and that of the university community must be respected. Other infectious diseases will be handled appropriately and reported according to State requirements. 81 At matriculation orientation all students will receive verbal and written protocols and procedure for care and treatment should exposure occur. Should an exposure occur students should immediately report exposure to any potentially infectious material (blood, open wounds, etc.) to their clinical instructor or appropriate agency. The protocols are as follows: If HIV status of source is unknown, whenever possible rapid HIV testing will be performed on source. If exposure occurs during Health Services hours of operation and source HIV status is unknown, student will call Health Services 407-823-0260 to speak with the medical director or his or her designee. If exposure occurs after Health Service hours of operation, or source is known HIV positive, student will proceed to nearest hospital emergency department for evaluation and treatment as deemed necessary. The student's clinical instructor and the student will report the exposure to the College of Medicine. The incident, including the names of all contact points, will be documented by the Office of Student Affairs. The student assumes responsibility for all charges associated with diagnosis and treatment. If exposure results in contraction of disease or disability, the student will be allowed to continue in the program to the extent that he or she does not pose a risk to self or others. In addition to the above described procedure IMMEDIATELY following a needle stick, laceration or skin exposure to blood/body fluid, individuals should wash the site with soap and water. Students SHOULD NOT squeeze the affected area. Mucus membrane exposures should have the area rinsed with copious amounts of water. The evaluating physician shall determine the risk of transmission, prophylaxis recommendations and indicated follow -up. Prophylaxis for Hepatitis B may be indicated, dependent on the status of the patient, the exposure and immunity of the student. When an exposed student is known to be immune to Hepatitis B, no prophylaxis or testing of the patient is needed. If a student is unsure of his or her status, laboratory testing can be performed to assess both the patient and student's status. If the student is not immune and the patient is positive for Hepatitis B, then the student should receive immune globulin and Hepatitis B vaccine series. Follow -up testing should be performed at six months to verify the student's Hepatitis B status. When HIV post -exposure prophylaxis is indicated , the most current antiretroviral medication(s) as outlined by the CDC will be employed. Students who opt to use 82 antiretroviral therapy will be followed at UCF Health Services for the appropriate duration of therapy. Follow -up HIV studies will be recommended at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Source patients should also be tested for Hepatitis C. Exposed students should receive follow -up testing for this virus as outlined by the CDC. F.

ADVISEMENT AND CAREER COUNSELING SYSTEM A. ADVISORS 1. Advising Program Students receive academic advisement and career counseling from three sources over the course of their medical education: a faculty advisor, a specialty advisor, and the Office of Student Affairs. The faculty advisor is primarily responsible for academic a dvising, and the specialty advisor is primarily responsible for career counseling and academic advising relevant to the clerkship years. The Office of Student Affairs , under the direction of the Associate Dean for Students, has overall responsibility for t he advising and counseling system. This includes providing faculty development to the faculty and specialty advisors, developing an overarching advising and career counseling program, and advising the student body both as a group and individually as needed . In addition, the Office of Student Affairs recognizes that students often form mentoring relationships with other faculty throughout the academic year (e.g., preceptors) and provides guidance to students on developing an effective, supportive student -men tor relationship. All students are assigned a faculty advisor in the fall of the M -1 academic year. The faculty advisor, who must be a core faculty member with the College of Medicine, is responsible for academic advising, professionalism, career counseli ng, and providing guidance when appropriate for personal matters. Students are encouraged to meet with their assigned faculty advisors at recommended intervals and more often as needed or desired. Ideally, the assigned faculty advisor stays with a particul ar student throughout the pre -clinical years of the M.D. Program. If there are circumstances which preclude a successful continued advisor -advisee relationship, then the Office of Student Affairs (through the Associate or Assistant Dean for Students) makes arrangements for an alternate advisor to be assigned. Faculty serving on the Student Evaluation and Promotions Committee (SEPC) for a particular academic year who are also serving as advisors for students within that academic year must recuse themselves from any SEPC business relating to those students. 85 In addition to having individual meetings with their faculty advisors, students have several small group sessions with their advisors throughout the academic year, coordinated by th e Office of Student Affairs. In these sessions, students and faculty advisors meet for a large group session focusing on professionalism, humanism, career planning or other issues of importance to students. Following the large group session, students meet in small groups led by their faculty advisor to allow for more in -depth discussion of the topic at -hand. Students are encouraged to take an active role in the development, planning, and execution of these small group sessions, as well as the advising progr am as a whole. Beginning in the third year, students are asked to choose one specialty advisor (or more, if appropriate) to provide specialty -specific guidance and assistance with applying to residency, as well as advisement in selecting electives. Ideally the specialty advisor writes one of the student's letters of recommendation, provides assistance and feedback with the residency application (personal statement, CV, ERAS application, etc.), and discusses a variety of residency programs around the country with the student. The Office of Student Affairs also provides substantial support for students during elective planning and the residency app lication process. Finally, the Office of Student Affairs holds regular meetings with students throughout the year to discuss issues of particular relevance to their phase of education. For example, at the beginning of the M -1 year, this session may focus on stress management, wellness, time management, and study skills. Special sessions are held by the Office of Student Affairs timed to coincide with critical events in the students' careers, such as preparation for the USMLE, orientation to the M -3 year, choosing electives and planning for the M -4 year, and application to residency. The Office of Student Affairs also works with students to develop and support specialty -interest groups, residency fairs, and workshops providing guidance to students on career choice and planning. 2. Advisor Assignments (Faculty) a. Role of the Faculty Advisor Essentially, the role of the advisor is to serve as an advocate for the student. Ideally, the relationship will develop into one in which the advisor is sought out by his or her advisee for counseling, friendship and advocacy. He or she becomes a trusted confidential guide. Although the frequency of contact depends largely upon the advisee, it is appropriate for the advisor to become pro-active in the relationship and initiate dialogue. For example, the advisor can offer guidance in such matters as surviving in medical school, geographic location, person al problems, and referral to other resources as necessary. Issuing caveats in certain areas is also within the realm of advisement. Being accessible to the student is important; therefore advisors are encouraged to maintain open -door policies. 86 b. Role of the Specialty Advisor The specialty advisor counsels the student in choosing and progressing toward a career, developi ng a senior year program which is in concert with the student's career goal, and assisting in the process of applying for residencies. Changes or adjustments to the senior year schedule must be approved by the specialty advisor and the Associate Dean for Students. c. Access to Student Records and Grades Guidelines of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), also known as the Buckley Amendment, are followed in managing student records and grades. The personal records and grades of a student on file in the Registrar's Office and the Office of Student Affairs are accessible for review by the assigned faculty and specialty advisors. It is the responsibility of the advisor to ensure confidentiality of all student records reviewed. d. Changing Advisors If for any reason a student wishes to change advisors, or vice versa, the Office of Student Affairs will affect the desired change upon request and provide appropriate notifications to the advisor and the student. 3. Career Counseling - Careers in Medicine (CiM) Program Career counseling is an ongoing process by faculty advisors, specialty advisors and the Office of Student Affairs during the student's enrollment. All faculty advisors will be trained in the AAMC Careers in Medicine program, which is a four -year program designed to assist students with the process of identifying their interests, exploring their options, choosing a specialty, and applying for residency . In addition to the personal and academic process, the Office of Student Affairs conducts programs to aid in specialty selection and career decision making. This includes, but may not be limited to: 1. Assignment of faculty advisors and, in Year 3, selection of specialty advisors. 2. Individual meetings with the Associate or Assistant Dean for Students. 3. A CiM password provided to each student for use throughout medical school during his/her first year. 4. NRMP Orientation and Advisement. 5. Elective Advisement and Scheduling Meetings. 6. Individual meetings with the faculty and/or specialty advisor, Associate or Assistant Dean for Students covering career selection and the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). 7. A residency application workshop late in Year 3 or early in Year 4. 4. Residency After completing your medical school education, you will enter a residency program. The term \"internship\" is no longer officially used to refer to the first year of post M.D. training. Each year of residency training is referred to as PGY-1, PGY -2, etc. (post -graduate year -1, etc.). Residency 87 programs are three to seven years in duration , depending on the specialty , and may be followed by fellowship training for some sub -specialties, i.e., pediatric car diology, vascular surgery, etc. You will begin to submit applications to residency programs at the start of your senior year. During the period prior to this, you may search the internet for or write to the programs that are of interest to you for brochures and applications. Most specialties and programs participate in the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS). The Associate Dean for Students and specialty advisors and faculty members are the best source of information on programs in a given specialty. The Office of Student Affairs will advise you on the application procedure and the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), which functions to match applicants with positions in hospital programs. In February of your final year, you will submit a list of programs, for which you wish to be considered, in descending order of preference to the NRMP. The programs submit to the NRMP a list of applicants in descending order of preference. The NRMP uses a computer algorithm to match the student with the program, giving the student the highest choice that was willing to accept that student. The program is weighted toward the student's preferences. 88 5.

Academic Assistance a. Peer Tutoring Students in the Class of 2014 have developed and are implementing peer tutoring for fellow students. b. Reading, Study Skills and Test -Taking Assistance Referrals to Counseling (Tutorial) and Study Skills Service Students are encouraged to take responsibility for their own learning and are provided with formative assessment results throughout each academic module. All students are encourage d to avail themselves of tutorial and study -skills services without referral. However, when students are noted as having academic difficulty at a Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee ( SEPC ) meeting, they will be strongly encouraged to avail themselves of these services, and in some instances, will be directed to do so in writing. If a student is repeatedly urged to arrange tutoring, counseling or study skills help, but does not do so and s ubsequently fails a module/clerkship, this will be made known to the SEPC to assist in evaluation of the student's overall performance and professional attitudes. If a student is directed to seek these referral services, the student has a choice of utilizing UCF services or private resources. Module/clerkship representatives to the SEPC are responsible for providing the Committee with reports of referrals made by module/clerkship faculty, as well as the student's utilization of referral services. Verific ation that the student has utilized these referral services may be required. In addition, the SEPC may require that the student have his or her tutor submit information and/or a recommendation to the SEPC relating to the student's academic program. The SEPC may, at its discretion, arrange for an independent evaluation of a student believed to be suffering from an emotional or addictive disorder, subject to the student's approval. Such independent evaluation shall be by a practitioner approved by the coll ege that is not involved in assessing the student's academic performance, and shall result in a report being forwarded to the college. Students who are experiencing difficulties with examinations may seek assistance through the College of Medicine's Student Academic Support Center, which provides services to medical students without charge. Assessments of reading skills, study skills and test -taking abilities are performed and a plan devised to improve student examination performance. Stude nts may also contact the Director of Student Academic Support Services for assistance. The UCF Counseling Center provides workshops and seminars on a variety of topics, such as stress management and healthy coping 90 strategies. Students also have access to UCF's Multicultural Academic and Support Services (MASS), which offer academic support services to retain and graduate multicultural students. V.

Attendance at SPCC meetings is mandatory for all SPCC representatives (primary and alternate) and the Chair. Absences will be excused, o nly in advance of a meeting, at the discretion of the Chair.

A motion for the removal of an SPCC representative must be made in writing to the Chair of the SPCC stating the exact reason(s) for the requested removal. An SPCC representative who is facing removal will be notified in writing 5 business days before the vote for removal as to why he or she is being considered for this action.

Removal of the SPCC Chair will follow the pr ocedures as specified in the M.D. Program Student Council Constitution. 1.9. Recognizing the value of non -student perspectives, a representative from the Office of S tudent Affairs will serve as an advisor to the SPCC. This advisor will be considered a resourc e to which the SPCC has constitutive access. However, this advisor does not have any voting privileges in the decisions of the SPCC.

COM students seeking care for such services at UCF HS will be directed to see other UCF HS providers as appropriate. PURPOSE: To clarify any conflict possible with College of Medicine students and physici ans who may also be faculty members. In particular, conflicts with physicians at UCF HS who hold faculty positions in the COM and have academic and/or clinical teaching responsibilities with medical students. PROCEDURE: Medical students will be notified of this provision during their orientation to the COM and written in their student handbook. Additionally, this specific information will be posted on UCF HS web sites. The UCF COM will supply UCF HS with a list of m atriculated students each year. UCF HS will flag all of these records to indicate they are UCF COM students. When medical students make an appointment at UCF HS with possible psychiatric, psychological or other sensitive concerns , they will be advised that they can request an appoi ntment with someone who is a non -faculty member or a faculty member who does not have an academic role with them. If a Faculty member who has academic or clinical teaching 123 responsibilities sees a medical student with psychiatric, psychological, or sensitiv e health issues , she or he must either remove themselves from any evaluation or grading role with that particular student , or refer the student to another physician who does not hold such academic or teaching "}
