Barnabas Today/triangle45right2 Barnabas Health Ambulatory Care Center Natural Approaches to Menopause Pave the Way to a Healthy Transition With an endless stream of work, family and personal commitments, who hastime to deal with menopause? Modernlifestyles leave many American womenill-prepared to cope properly with this stage of their lives, and even expected symptoms can wallopthose who don't pay attention to basic wellness measures. \"Menopause often hits people harder in this society than other cultures,\" says Minal Vazirani, MD, the medical director of the Siegler Center for Integrative Medicine. Dr. Vazirani is a dual, board-certified internist andpediatrician at Barnabas Health Ambulatory Care Center,who is also certified in integrative holistic medicine. \"I think because we don't pay attention to our diets,exercise or daily routine, we let stress get the most of us.Life just creeps up.\" Typical menopause symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats, insomnia, mood changes, trouble focusing andvaginal dryness can seem to sneak up on women as well, Dr. Vazirani explains, even if they're well-informed andknow what to anticipate. But a common response to suchsymptoms in the past - hormone replacement therapy, or HRT - was later linked with several scary health risks such as blood clots and cancer. These scientific revelations changed many physicians' and patients'approach to menopause from medicinal to natural. A Host of Options \"We don't knee-jerk HRT on everyone anymore,\" saysDaria Klachko, MD , a Barnabas Health gynecologist with a particular interest in menopause. \"Although the overallrisks are low, we tend not to put people on hormones unlessthere's a reason - one of which is significant symptoms. We have to carefully decide who is a candidate or not and look at the risks versus benefits to see if it's worth a small risk for a better quality of life.\"Adds Dr. Vazirani: \"Nature intended this hormonal change to occur for a reason and we're just putting band-aids on itby treating it with hormones. There's a natural way to gothrough this transition.\" Nutrition should be of core emphasis in an integrative approach to menopause, Dr. Vazirani says. Whilespecific advice should be individualized, a few basic tenets that usually share a common threadwith many women include adopting a diet rich in \"whole\" or unprocessed foods, with an emphasison vegetables, beans, seeds, nuts, fruits, lean low-fatproteins and healthy fats. In fact, she says, somefoods such as soy and flax have specifically been studied for their effects on menopausalsymptoms. For women with milder symptoms who desirefurther relief, areoften black cohosh IRREGULAR BLEEDING: Chaste berry INSOMNIA: Ginseng Barnabas Today /triangle45right3 Barnabas Health Ambulatory Care Center But talk to your doctor before taking any herbal supplements, Dr. Vazirani advises. \"They can interact with prescriptionmedications, and even be contraindicated or controversial ifa woman has other medical issues such as breast cancer, forinstance,\" she adds. \"Just because something is naturaldoesn't mean it's safe.\" Personalized Plan is Best As helpful as herbal supplements can be, Dr. Vazirani prefers an individualized approach to menopause involving a detailed conversation between a woman and her doctor to tailor integrative lifestyle measures to her specificsymptoms and needs. \"Since menopause doesn't occur overnight, if women approaching menopause pay attention to rebalancing themselves, they're more likely to have a smoother transition,\" she says. \"It's very individualized - for some women, their menopause involves more irritability, anxiety or hot flashes and sweating, and for others, the mainconcerns are osteoporosis, vaginal dryness or brainfog. We customize our holistic wellness plans based on a woman's specific needs.\" \"The resounding message is to pay attention to your self care, follow a balanced diet, get enough sleep and exercise and pay attention to your mental and social health,\" Dr. Vazirani adds. \"Even something simple like taking a walk every day, or a long bath, or taking a yoga class or meditation class can make a difference . . . why not try to handle the transition as naturally as possible?\"Embracing a Holistic Approach Dr. Vazirani feels lucky that most patients who see her aboutmenopause symptoms already have an interest in integrativeand holistic medicine, so no convincing is necessary forthem to embrace this approach. For others, she stresses that integrative medicine is not simply symptom-based but also includes factors such aslifestyle, stress level and family history. \"So much goes intoit,\" she explains. \"Health care providers weigh out a lot more details than just 'this symptom equals treatment with this hormone or supplement.'\" Other integrative therapies - such as meditation, yoga, acupuncture and deep breathing exercises - can be added tothe mix to maximize symptom relief and overall quality of life. \"I can't tell you how many patients come back to me two months after something as simple as starting yoga and say,'I'm sleeping better, my mood is better' . . . they noticechanges beyond just the physical aspect of it,\" Dr. Vaziranisays. \"They really do get the mind-body benefits.\" What about the rare woman for whom none of the many natural approaches makes a significant dent in menopausemisery? \"Starting with the least-invasive, most gentleinterventions would be my first approach,\" she adds,and then we can increase interventions as needed.\" Minal Vazirani, MD Medical Director of the Siegler Center for Integrative Medicine For more information or an appointment with Dr. Vazirani, please call 973.322.7007.Barnabas Today/triangle45right4 Saint Barnabas Medical Center Menopause 101: What You Need to Know About 'The Change ' Before becoming mothers, most women have absorbed all the basicsabout childbirth from books, TV and\"tales from the trenches\" of friendswho've gone before them. Not so with menopause - another rite of passage that'sinevitable as women age. Whether that's due toa fear of getting older or a lack of information,many women don't know all they should aboutthe transition to their post-reproductive years - which could comprise one-third or more of their lives. \"I think in general that women have a lot of questions about menopause,\" says Daria Klachko, MD, a Saint Barnabas Medical Center gynecologist with a particular interest inmenopause. \"In a time when their bodies arechanging, and changing so dramatically, a lot ofwomen need to come to their doctors to discussthe changes. It can be scary sometimes - theywonder if they're normal. \"A lot of women already know how to care for themselves in pregnancy, what to eat andwhat happens at each stage,\" she adds. \"But Ifind there's a void for the menopause andperimenopause crowd as to how to take care of themselves at this stage of their lives.\" Barnabas Today/triangle45right5 Saint Barnabas Medical Center That said, it's important for women to communicate with health professionals to determine if symptoms they'reexperiencing are typical to the menopausal transition - such as hot flashes, weight gain or abnormal bleeding - are actually due to menopause and not other, potentiallyharmful conditions. Thyroid disorders, for example, cancause heat and cold intolerance, Dr. Klachko explains, and polyps or cysts can trigger irregular bleeding. Armed with Knowledge Since \"forewarned is forearmed,\" as the old saying goes, here are somebasics about menopause you should know to help guide you smoothly andhealthily through the transition: Menopause - defined as the absence of menstrual periods for at least 12 consecutive months - arrives for Americanwomen at an average age of 51. But perimenopause - whendramatic hormone fluctuations cause symptoms in 85% of all women - can last from 2 to 8 years beforehand. For somewomen menopause happens as early as age 40 or as late as 55. Symptoms can vary from month to month as the hormones estrogen and progesterone are produced in varying amountsby the ovaries. Eventually the ovaries will stop producingthese hormones. In addition to menopause symptoms listedpreviously, other common ones include insomnia; moodchanges; \"brain fog\" focusing; osteoporosis, orthinning of the bones; night sweats; and vaginal dryness. Women can still become pregnant during perimenopause, so birth control is necessary until periods cease completely(unless you wish to become pregnant). Periods can comemore or less often than before, last more days or fewer, and be lighter or heavier, so the only way to know you have gone through menopause is if you have not had your period for a full year.Not Just a Reproductive Issue With such a wide-ranging set of possible symptoms, it's clear that menopause doesn't just affect a woman'sreproductive status - it can impact her entire quality of life. One symptom often dominoes into others, Dr. Klachkonotes, causing a ripple effect that's difficult to cope with. \"Hot flashes can be disruptive during the day, and they can be embarrassing,\" she says. \"You could be giving apresentation to a whole bunch of people at work and you'resuddenly sweating. Night sweats can interrupt sleep, so ifyou're constantly not getting a good night's sleep, it's hard to focus and get through the day. And vaginal dryness canincrease intimacy issues.\" Acknowledging that some women can be embarrassed by these changes in their bodies and lives, Dr. Klachkoencourages them to recognize that \"there is help out there.\" \"Instead of being embarrassed and ashamed, women should talk to their gynecologist,\" she adds. \"It's nice to talk togirlfriends, but it's really important to talk to someone inhealth care. It's really important to schedule regular doctors' visits and think about preventive medicine.\" Daria Klachko, MD Gynecologist Saint Barnabas Medical Center For a Saint Barnabas Medical Center gynecologist, call 1.888.724.7123 or visit www.barnabashealth.org/sbmc.Barnabas Today/triangle45right6 Saint Barnabas Medical Center The main goal of radiation therapy is to kill as many cancerous cells at a tumor site as possible without harminghealthy cells nearby. But what happens when patientsbreathe during radiation treatments - thereby making the tumor a moving target? New technology sets Saint Barnabas Medical Center apart from most cancer centers byaccommodating breathing movement during radiation, allowing for more precise targeting with higher doses of therapy. The Elekta Agility system is a linear accelerator acquired by Saint Barnabas last fall along with a 4-D simulator that provides CT scansjust before radiation. Together, these help pinpoint tumor locations andalso account for patients' breathing and movement. The new equipment- manufactured by the Elekta Co. - will be used for patients with manydifferent types of malignancies, including those of the lungs, pancreasand liver and metastases to the spine. \"What it does is help us better customize treatment for patients, whether their tumors are deeper or more superficial and whether theyneed higher- or lower-dose energy beams,\" says Alison Grann, MD , chairman of Radiation Oncology at Saint Barnabas. \"It's a way to targetvery small tumor volumes with very high-dose targeted radiationtherapy. So, especially for a small lung cancer, it's been shown to be very effective at curing many of these tumors equally or better than surgery alone.\"New Radiation Equipment Helps Cancer Patients Breathe Easier Barnabas Today/triangle45right7 Saint Barnabas Medical Center More Accurate Beams Lung cancer cases, in particular, present a treatment challenge because older radiation technology can require patients to holdtheir breath while beams are aimed at smaller tumors, Dr.Grann says. But the Elekta Agility \"accounts for patients' respiration to minimize the volume of tissues we're treating.\" \"It can very accurately give a dose of radiation to treat cancer while minimizing toxicities,\" she adds. \"We don't need patientsto hold their breathing for this to target small tumors.\" A so-called cone beam CT scanner on the Agility helps technicians plan each patient's radiation strategy in real time as their situation changes, allowing for more precise targeting.\"We can compare on the machine the original radiation plan to the daily tumor location and make minimal adjustments -for the rotation of the patient, or if the tumor changes,\" Dr. Grann says. \"We can see the volume of the tumor andadjust compared to what was originally planned.\" In addition, certain tumors are more resistant to radiation therapy, Dr. Grann says, so the ability to use concentratedhigher doses without the threat of harming nearby tissues is a huge benefit. \"If you can give a higher dose of radiation perday, you may be able to prevent the progression of certaincancers you otherwise coul d not treat,\" she adds. No Downsides to Treatment Dr. Grann enthusiastically praises the Elekta equipment, saying it presents no downsides in its ability to treat tough cancer casesand can greatly improve quality of life. \"Especially for patients with lung cancer, so many are not candidates for surgery because they smoked or had lungdisease,\" she says. \"More and more evidence is showing thatthis equipment can even cure these patients, so we're excitedto be able to offer it.\" With metastatic disease, which frequently presents with pain, radiation is a very effective tool when cancer has spread to thebones. \"For patients treated with radiation in the past, thisoffers the potential for retreatment,\" Dr. Grann adds. \"Becausethe spinal cord, for instance, is very sensitive to radiation, wemight not have been able to offer more treatment previously,but this is more accurate so we can potentially treat progressionin the bones and spine.\"Accessory Aids Breast Cancer Treatmen t Along with the Elekta Agility, a software called Clarity can help treat women receiving radiation after a lumpectomy surgery forbreast cancer. The Clarity, which essentially is an ultrasounddevice equipped with lasers, can more accurately define thecavity in breast tissue left after a lumpectomy and target high-dose radiation beams to as small an area around it as possible. \"We're on the same plane now with larger cancer centers with this technology,\" Dr. Grann says. \"As we expand the use of this technology, there may be other tumor sites where we'reable to use it.\" The new technology places Saint Barnabas in the highest grouping of cancer centers in the tri-state area, she says. Radiation Oncology at Saint Barnabas has always been a very high-quality department with good technology and highlytrained physicians. \"This piece of equipment further enhancesthe department capabilites.\" Alison Grann, MD Chairman of Radiation Oncology at Saint Barnabas Medical Center For more information, please call 973.322.5630.Barnabas Today/triangle45right8 Saint Barnabas Medical Center Acancer diagnosis brings chaos to patients' lives. Fears for their physical health naturally top the list, butstarting treatment also prompts a variety of otherdaunting questions: How will I manage to care for my family? How will my partner cope? Should I take time off work? Will all my bills get paid? In the past, these swirling patient concerns took time for health care professionals to detect and tackle. The Cancer Program at SaintBarnabas is leading the way in identifying patients needingpsychosocial intervention through the use of online questionnairesthat instantly point out who needs emotional, psychological, spiritual,financial or practical support to move through their health crisis. Launched in November 2012, the Distress Screening Program at The Cancer Program at Saint Barnabas Medical Center is the first of itskind in New Jersey. At their second visit after diagnosis, patients usecomputer tablets to answer a variety of questions covering an entirespectrum of potential fears, concerns and problems. With this real-time technology, staff members know who needs extra assistance -and what kind - before patients even leave the building. State-of-the-Art System Beats Paper \"The Distress Screening Program is very patient-friendly, identifyingthe issues people have and allowing us to respond to the need in realtime,\" says Angela McCabe, LCSW, director of psychosocial supportservices for the Cancer Program. \"I'll know when they hit 'send'whether we need to see them that day.\" \"Patients can tell us if they want to talk, don't want to talk or want written information. We have a whole triage system where emails go to physicians, the nursing team and the psychosocial teamidentifying the areas with which a person might need help.\" Distress Screening Program Yields Instant Information About Cancer Patients' Psychosocial NeedsBarnabas Today/triangle45right9 BARNABAS HEALTH AMBULATORY CARE CENTERSaint Barnabas Medical Center To gain accreditation from the Commission on Cancer, hospitals must demonstrate that they've evaluated distresslevels in all cancer patients. The Cancer Program at Saint Barnabas decided to use this new automated processto achieve that objective instead of a paper versionbecause it's much faster and allows quicker intervention,Ms. McCabe explains. \"The paper version takes one to two weeks to get results,\" she says. \"What's also nice about this system is that thequestions address every part of someone's life - if they arein spiritual crisis, for example, I will know after this surveyis completed. To me, the paper version is potentially aliability - we need to respond to concerns in real time.\" Cancer patients often downplay their many worries when speaking to health care professionals, but answeringquestions on a tablet \"de-stigmatizes some of these issuesfor them,\" Ms. McCabe says. \"They want to be goodpatients and not perceived as complainers. This gives them a neutral way to report problems.\" Comprehensive Solutions Offered What kind of issues do patients frequently describe? \"Some are as simple as not having transportation to get to appointments,\" Ms. McCabe explains. \"We ask if they have responsibilities caring for other people - children or parents. We ask folks about their pain, emotionaldistress and practical issues. \"One of the surprising things is, a lot of people can't pay their rent,\" she adds, noting that doctors, nurses and socialworkers can help coordinate many types of services totackle these challenges. \"We're finding out these thingsearlier in the process and assisting prior to evictionnotices. Since we do this in real time, within that day thepatient is getting the information and resources needed togo forward.\" Other types of patient and family intervention at The Cancer Program at Saint Barnabas - all available free ofcharge - include individual counseling and support groups,integrative treatments such as art therapy, holistic nursing, spiritual care, and a lecture series devoted to a host of topics related to cancer diagnosis, treatment andsurvivorship strategies. \"That's all part of the care here at Saint Barnabas,\" Ms. McCabe says. Next Steps As the Distress Screening Program gets fully underway, the goal is for all Cancer Center at Saint Barnabas patientsto complete the online questionnaire once. Going forward,however, Ms. McCabe hopes to offer the evaluationrepeatedly to each patient at various stages of treatment -when needs and concerns likely change. \"We'll do this for changes in treatment, which are pivotal times,\" she says. \"We see this as a great instrument for us to keep on top of psychosocial stressors for people as theygo through the continuum of cancer treatment.\" \"It has definitely raised the standards of clinical care,\" Ms. McCabe adds. \"We're seeing a higher level of patientsatisfaction. We definitely have enhanced clinical practice,with my team in particular meeting a lot more patients.\" For more information or to contact The Cancer Center at Saint Barnabas, please call 973.322.5200.When Antonio Carreiro needed a kidney transplant, he was fortunate. His wife of27 years was a match. Many transplantswould begin and end there - with onedonor and one recipient. But, thanks to the new Compatible Share Program offered at The LivingDonor Institute, part of the Renal and Pancreas TransplantDivision at Saint Barnabas Medical Center, the transplantteam presented the Carreiros with a chance to help otherswaiting for life-saving kidney transplants. A compatible donor/recipient pair may choose to participate in the Compatible Share Program because it provides achance to improve the recipient's long-term outcomethrough the ability to match with a younger donor kidney or improved compatibility. In addition, an opportunity existsto help more people receive a kidney who otherwise maycontinue to wait for an extended amount of time. When presented with the option, the Carreiros liked that others awaiting transplant could potentially be helped. They also learned that while Liza Carreiro's kidney was a very good match for her husband, receiving a youngerdonor kidney through an exchange and one with a bettercompatibility could actually improve his long-term outcome. \"As long as we were doing this, we decided it was best to find a closer match for better success,\" Mrs. Carreiro explains.\"During their own time of need, the Carreiros, who were fortunate enough to be compatible with each other, wereable to embrace the opportunity available through this newprogram and help others in the process,\" explains Shamkant Mulgaonkar, MD, Chief of the Barnabas Health Renal and Pancreas Transplant Division. \"It's a beautiful gift.\" Ultimately, the Carreiros decision to take part in the Compatible Share Program resulted in two other womenreceiving new kidneys and no longer requiring dialysis.\"Once we understood how the Compatible Share Programworked, we supported the idea and, in the end, it greatlybenefited everyone involved,\" says Mr. Carreiro. \"We are so glad that we were not just getting him well, but helping others get well too,\" Ms. Carreiro adds.Innovative New ProgramHelps MakeMore KidneyTransplantsPossible Barnabas Today/triangle45right10 Saint Barnabas Medical CenterPioneers in Living Donor Transplantation The Barnabas Health Renal and Pancreas Transplant Division is the first program in New Jersey and among a few in the country to offer patients participation in aCompatible Share Program. It represents the latest excitingaddition to its comprehensive Living Donor Institute which includes Living-Related and Emotionally-RelatedDonor Transplantation, Program for IncompatibleTransplants, the Living Donor Kidney Exchange Program and Altruistic Living Donation. \"We are continually challenged to be creative in pursuing new options for people who are waiting for a renal transplant,\"says Marie Morgievich, Nurse Practitioner and Manager ofThe Living Donor Institute at Saint Barnabas. Transplantexperts are turning to more innovative alternatives like theCompatible Share Program to address the growing demandfor organs. Traditional deceased organ donation cannot meetthe ever growing need. In New Jersey alone, there are nearly3,000 people waiting for a kidney transplant and the listcontinues to grow at a rapid pace. Like all of its transplant programs, the centerpiece of the Compatible Share Programs is comprehensive education forboth the recipient and the donor. \"Our team has spent over a year developing this approach,\" stresses Ms. Morgievich. Itwas a thorough process that involved in-depth examinationof delicate humanitarian and ethical issues. \"Our emphasis is on the integrity of each donation and ensuring that thehealth and rights of both recipients and donors are protected.\" About the Renal and Pancreas Transplant Division of Barnabas Health By combining advanced technology, resources and research with an exceptional staff and personalized supportfor patients and families, the world-class Barnabas Health Renal and Pancreas Transplant Division has become apremier destination for patients.

Born prematurely in November 1997 at less than two pounds each, the twins' parents have always told themtheir survival depended on the dedication of staffmembers in Saint Barnabas' Neonatal Intensive CareUnit (NICU). It seems fitting, then, that the 15-year-old twins are now giving back to the hospital in their new role asvolunteers. Both interested in future medical careers, the rising Parsippany High School sophomores spendThursday afternoons delivering mail to various patientsand departments and checking out the dynamics of theplace they may someday want to settle in from aprofessional capacity. \"Saint Barnabas was their first home, because I couldn't take them home like other moms,\" says their mother,Megan Wu, calling the duo her \"miracle babies\" sincethey resulted from in vitro fertilization (IVF) after 12years of infertility. \"For those four months, the doctorsand nurses were like my family. I felt so much love in theNICU.\" Early Challenges, Lucky Outcome Like most severely premature infants, the Wu twins -born at 24 weeks of gestation - faced a multitude ofmedical complications at the outset. Both needed eyesurgeries, blood transfusions and help from ventilators to breathe. While they continued to develop mostlyunscathed, Abraham suffered permanent vision loss inone eye. \"But their hearing is very, very good,\" Mrs. Wuquips, noting their participation in their church's youthworship group. \"Both have perfect pitch.\" Arriving home from the hospital at a relatively lusty 4 pounds, 8 ounces and 5 pounds, 10 ounces, respectively, Gloria and Abraham went on to excel in school anddevelop diverse interests ranging from music to reading tosports. Because their father, Zuliang, is a dentist and manyfamily members are medical professionals, the Wusencouraged their children to consider careers in medicine. Full Circle Volunteering at Saint Barnabas offers the Parsippanyteens an up-close experience in a busy hospital whilesatisfying the family's desire to pay back the dedicationthat helped sustain the twins through their earliestmonths. \"It feels great,\" says Gloria, who plays piano and drums and takes private fencing lessons. \"It's another way ofshowing huge gratitude to the doctors and nurses.Without them, we probably wouldn't have survived.\" Adds Abraham, who plays cello and likes to cook: \"It's just very gratifying because I can see how energetic thedoctors, nurses and all staff members are in taking care of people. I'm happy to be there to help.\" Gloria Wu, Zuliang Wu, Megan Wu and Abraham WuBarnabas Today/triangle45right12Saint Barnabas Medical Center Integrative Healing Therapies Ease Stress Since many heart problems can be worsened by stress, finding ways to promote relaxation forcardiac patients can be crucial to their recovery.At Saint Barnabas Medical Center, state-of-the-art medical treatment is complemented by integrative healing therapies such as guided imagery,reflexology and breathing exercises to support cardiacpatients' total care on their path to wellness. Once considered on the fringe of conventional medical care, holistic treatments have become far more mainstream overthe past decade and most patients are very receptive to theconcept, says Lorraine Ernst, RN, MS, the hospital's leadSaint Barnabas holistic nurse coordinator. Because of itspopularity, she says, Saint Barnabas is now extending itsintegrative healing program from its original focus oncardiac patients to those with cancer, pulmonary issues,burns and other conditions.\"It augments what we're already doing inmodern medicine,\" Ms. Ernst says. \"Whenyou experience any of these modalities, youinduce relaxation - which is where you learnto lower your respiration, heart rate andblood pressure. The first thing these therapiescan help with is reducing the effects of thestress response.\" Personalized Focus About 1,000 cardiac inpatients benefit each year from the Integrative Cardiac Wellness Program, mostly before or after surgery. An advanced practice holistic nurse such asMs. Ernst meets with each patient to discuss health habits,quality of life issues, stress management and spirituality and to offer various integrative healing therapies. Relaxation techniques include guided imagery, which helps replace negative thoughts with positive, empoweringimages; massage, to loosen tissue and improve blood andlymph flow; animal-assisted therapy, which is proven tolower heart rate; and reflexology, which applies pressure to various reflex points on the feet to promote energy flow and stimulate toxin release. \"We'll go in and see patients and they may just want someone to talk to. The pet therapy, for instance, may be abridge to speak to them,\" Ms. Ernst explains. \"Breath work -where they're taught conscious breathing, slow deepbreathing and abdominal breathing - can really help calmpeople down.\" \"It's very unique and individual,\" she adds. \"We help treat the acute problems and then move into the chronic or continuous.

Barnabas Today/triangle45right20 Barnabas Health Institute for Prevention Project TALK for Kids If you are the parent or guardian of a child making the transition to middle school this September, you may be wondering why your typically calm and collected son or daughter is suddenly stressing about the first day of school. Arecent survey conducted at Radburn ElementarySchool in Fairlawn, NJ,asked 60 fifth-grade studentswhat is concerning them most about the start of middle school. \"We were surprised at how eager the students were to share their thoughts,\" says Carol Sprague, Prevention Specialist, Barnabas Health Institute for Prevention, who leads the school's Project TALK (Teaching Alternat ive Skills to Kids) program. Project TALK is a school-based program that helps to identify and assess high-risk youth and guide them in attaining skills to increase their ability to succeed in school and life. What is your child thinking about most? Homework overload, mean or strict teachers, changes in friendships, detention for being late to class, andlocker problems are the top five concerns, according to Ms. Sprague. \"We're certainly not helpless when it comes to guiding our children through a smooth and relatively anxiety-free transition,\" adds Ms. Sprague. \"While it's not realistic to try to shield them from every challenge orstressor, we can prepare them to meet their perceivedobstacles with confidence by acknowledging theirfeelings and showing empathy.\" Keep the lines of communication open . Although your child may not voice all of his/herconcerns about starting middle school, odds are thathe/she is thinking about the change. Gently bring up thetopic by asking what he/she is looking forward to most. Listen. Make an effort to listen without interrupting or belittling the concerns. Saying \"having a locker is no big deal\" or\"just make sure you're on time,\" is not likely to make apositive impact. Instead, talk about steps he/she can taketo be on time or even purchase a combination lock andpractice over the summer. Instill confidence. \"One of the lessons we offer to students in Project TALK involves learning to be assertive and to disagree respectfully,\" shares Ms. Sprague, citing that these confidence-building traits are powerful tools in overcoming peer pressure and bullying. \"Parents can help build a child's confidence by giving him/herresponsibilities, such as chores, and offering praise for the effort.\" Giving your son or daughter the opportunityto make decisions on his/her own, helping him/herunderstand that mistakes are part of the growing process and taking an interest in his/her hobbies are other ways to help instill confidence.
