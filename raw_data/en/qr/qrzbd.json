PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 23 Community Transition Services Service Specification Service Title: Community Transition Services Service Definition (Scope): Community Transition Services are non -recurring set -up expenses for beneficiaries who are transitioning from an Institutional or another provider -operated living arrangement to a living arrangement where the person has a lease (e.g., apartment) or is in a private residence. The beneficiary is directly responsible for his or her own living expenses. Allowable expenses are those necessary to enable a person to establish a basic household that do not constitute R oom and Board and may include: (a) security deposits that are required to obtain a lease on an apartment or home; (b) essential household furnishings and moving expenses required to occupy and use a community domicile, including furniture, window coverings , food preparation items, and bed/bath linens; (c) set -up fees or deposits for utility or service access, including telephone, electricity, heating and water; (d) services necessary for the beneficiary's health and safety, such as pest eradication and one -time cleaning prior to occupancy; (e) moving expenses; (f) necessary home accessibility adaptations; and, (g) activities to assess need, arrange for, and procure needed resources. Community Transition Services are furnished only to the extent that they are reasonable and necessary as determined through the Recovery Plan development process; clearly identified in the Recovery Plan; the person is unable to meet such expense; or when the services cannot be obtained from other sources. Community Transition Serv ices do not include monthly rental or mortgage expense, food, regular utility charges, and/or household appliances or items that are intended for purely diversional/recreational purposes. Community Transition Services may not include payment for Room and Board. The payment of a security deposit is not considered rent. When Community Transition Services are furnished to beneficiaries returning to the community from a Medicaid institutional setting through entrance to the waiver, the costs of such servic es are considered to be incurred and billable when the person leaves the institutional setting and enters PROMISE. The beneficiary must be reasonably expected to be eligible for and to enroll in the waiver. If, for any unseen reason, the beneficiary does n ot enroll in the waiver (e.g., due to death or a significant change in condition), Transitional services may be billed to Medicaid as an administrative cost. Community Transition Services may be furnished as a PROMISE service to beneficiaries who transitio n from provider -operated settings other than Medicaid reimbursable institutions to their own private residence in the community. Community Transition Services may not be used to pay for furnishing living arrangements that are owned or leased by a PROMISE provider, where the provision of these items and services are inherent to the service they are already providing. Specify applicable (if any) limits on the amount, frequency, or duration of this service: Community Transition Services are limited to $1,800 per person, but may be exceeded on a case -by-case basis with prior authorization, based on medical necessity. Additional medical necessity criteria for receiving the service, if applicable (specify): To be authorized as a PROMISE service on a Recovery Plan, the following authorization criteria must be met at a minimum: The service is recommended by the Care Manager and the beneficiary in collaboration, and the service is included in the beneficiary's Recovery Plan, AND Requests for home accessibility adaptations align with the unique needs of the beneficiary (e.g., beneficiary with hearing impairment needs additional alerting systems for doorbells and smoke alarms; beneficiary with a wheelchair needs a ramp leading to the front door). The service is directly related to a goal on the beneficiary's Recovery Plan related to transitioning from an institutional or other provider -operated living arrangement to a living arrangement where the beneficiary has a lease (e.g., apartment) or is in a private residence, AND The beneficiary is unable to meet such expense or obtain needed support from other sources (i.e., other sources have been exhausted first), AND The service will not be used for monthly rental or mortgage expenses, Room and Board, food, regular utility charges, and/or household appliances or items that are intended for purely diversional/recreational purposes, AND PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 24 The beneficiary has not received this service previously for transition to this setting.

PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 26 Community -based Residential Alternatives Excluding Assisted Living (Residential Alternatives) Service Specification Service Title: Community -based Residential Alternatives Excluding Assisted Living (Residential Alternatives) Service Definition (Scope): Community -based Residential Alternatives (excluding Assisted Living) offer a cost-effective, community -based alternative to Nursing Facility care for persons with behavioral health needs. Community - based Residential services are supportive and health -related Residential services provided to beneficiaries in settings licensed by the State. Residential services are necessary, as specified in the Recovery Plan, to enable the beneficiary to re main integrated in the community and ensure the health, welfare, and safety of the beneficiary. Community -based Residential services include Personal Care and Supportive services (Homemaker, Chore, Attendant services, and Meal Preparation) that are furnished to beneficiaries who reside in home -like, non -institutional, integrated settings. In addition, 24 -hour on site response capability to meet scheduled and unscheduled or unpredictable beneficiary needs and to provide supervision and safety. Service s also include social and recreational programming, and medication assistance (to the extent permitted under State law). This service includes assisting beneficiaries in acquiring, retaining, and improving skills such as communication, self -help, domestic, self-care, socialization, fine and gross motor skills, mobility, personal adjustment, relationship development, use of community resources, and adaptive skills necessary to reside successfully in home and community -based settings. As needed, this service may also include prompting to carry out desired behaviors and/or to curtail inappropriate behaviors, as well as Habilitative services to instruct beneficiaries in accessing and using community resources such as transportation, translation, and comm unication assistance related to a Habilitative outcome, and services to assist the beneficiary in shopping and other necessary activities of community and civic life, including self -advocacy. Finally, assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) and i nstrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) are included. This service will be provided to meet the beneficiary's needs as determined by an assessment performed in accordance with DHSS requirements and as outlined in the beneficiary's Recovery Plan. ADLs include tasks related to caring for and moving the body: Walking. Bathing. Dressing. Toileting. Brushing teeth. Eating. IADLs are the activities not directly related to functional activities; rather, they are assistance with an additional set of more complex life functions necessary for maintaining a person's immediate environment and living independently in the community. IADLs include: Cooking and meal planning. Performing ordinary housework. Getting around in the community. Using the telephone or computer. Shopping for groceries. Supporting the beneficiary in exploring employment opportunities. Keeping track of finances. Managing medication including assisting with setting up medication administration mechanisms (e.g., pill jars) and ensuring that beneficiaries have the supports necessary to timely take medications. (Not appropriate for Peer Specialists.) PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 27 If there is more than one (1) staff member on site at the residence during normal hours who can provide Personal Care services, the provider will be encouraged to hire staff to deliver Personal Care services separate from staff who provide Habilitation services that involve the development of ADL and IADL skills. This will ensure that the clinical boundary issues that would otherwise complicate Habilitation services (if the same staff were also delivering Personal Care services) will be mitigated. Services must be delivered in a manner that supports the beneficiary's communication needs including, but not limited to, age appropriate communication, translation/Interpretation services for beneficiaries that are of limited English proficiency, or who have other communication needs requiring translation, and assistance with the provider's understanding and use of communication devices used by the beneficiary. The cost of transportation provided by Residential service providers to and from activities is included as a component of the Residential services and, therefore, is reflected in the rate for the service. Providers of Residential services are responsible for the full range of Transportation services needed by the beneficiaries they serve to participate in services and activities specified in their Recover y Plan. This includes transportation to and from day activities and Employment services, as applicable. The following levels of Residential services are available to beneficiaries as determined necessary, based upon a quarterly assessment, documented in the Recovery Plan, and approved by DHSS. Note: prior to be eligible for Tier 1, the beneficiary is considered to be in Tier 0 and eligible to receive any PROMISE services other than Community -based Residential Alternatives. Tier 0 \u2014 Private Housing or Transitional Housing (not eligible for Community -based Residential Alternatives/Residential Alternatives) For this tier, a beneficiary may be in private non -supported housing, in transitional housing with a State Rental Assistance Progra m (SRAP) voucher awaiting location of permanent housing, or in permanent housing with a SRAP voucher. Housing assistance, if offered, is State or federally funded. Room and Board is not Medicaid funded and is outside of Residential Alternatives. This tier equates to the current transitional housing or SRAP voucher program. All PROMISE services on a beneficiary's Recovery Plan are provided by community providers. Model 1 \u2014 Habilitative Supports in the Home (the Beneficiary is Encouraged to seek Behavioral Health Treatment for SPMI in the Community) (Tiers 1 and 2) Tier 1 The goal should be to move to independent living, by reducing the need for ADL and IADL assistance, while considering social needs and the resulting proper timing of move to inde pendent living. Residential staff should be part of the clinical team \u2014 in recovery planning, etc. This tier is not available in a Group Home. The beneficiary's PROMISE Recovery Plan indicates when Residential Alternatives staff assist with ADLs (and IADLs). A beneficiary requires: Limited supervision as the beneficiary is able to make safe decisions when in familiar surroundings, but requires occasional increased need for assistance or to address unanticipated needs, with supports available on a 24-hour on call or as-needed basis, AND Incidental or intermittent hands -on assistance or cueing for at least one (1) ADL and at least one (1) IADL, OR Incidental or intermittent hands -on assistance or cueing with at least three (3) IADLs, OR Instruction in accessing and using community resources such as transportation, translation, and communication assistance related to a Habilitative outcome, and services to assist the beneficiary in shopping and other necessary activities of community and civic life, including self-advocacy, OR Instruction in developing or maintaining financial stability and security (e.g., understanding budgets, managing money, and the right to manage their own money). Tier 1 Community -based Residential Alternatives services are provided in a Supervised Apartment setting up to 18 months by a Supportive Housing Agency complying with the following staffing ratios for 6-10 beneficiaries not in ACT/ICM. One (1) staff is on site during business hou rs to assist with ADLs. The staff has a high school degree. A high school level staff person is on call for evening and weekend back -up. *On-call staff do not sleep overnight. A total of 4.25 FTE, including .25 FTE of a Residence Manager/Supervisor's time is assumed in the rates. Note: Staff on clinical teams (e.g., co-occurring PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 28 clinic staff) provide Community -based Behavioral Health Treatment/Rehabilitation and consult to site staff. Community -based Residential Alternatives services are not available to beneficiaries on an ACT/ICM team assessed at Tier 1. If the beneficiary is on an ACT/ICM team, the ACT/ICM teams provides all Day services, the Community -based Residential Alternatives provider does not provide Day Support. In addition, the ACT/ICM team provides Night Support. The ACT/ICM provides on call staff for evening and weekend back -up. On-call staff do not sleep overnight. Medical Necessity Criteria for Tier 1 American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Criteria Low immediate need on ASAM: 1. Substance Abuse: adequate ability (second choice). 2. Biomedical: no known or stable. 3. Suicidality: can have up to \"has frequent thoughts\" (#2). 3. Suicidality: Control/Impulsivity \u2014 low. 3. Dangerousness: can have history, but not current. 3. Self -care: requires assistance in personal care, life skills \u2014 must assess number of ADLs/IADLs needed and must meet PROMISE service description criteria. Independent Living Inquiry Assess ADL/IADL need. Initial assistance for one (1) ADL and one (1) IADL, but continuing assistance/monitoring not needed OR initial assistance for three (3) IADLs*, but continuing assistance/monitoring not needed. Community Living Questionnaire Person's preference (Q2) helps determine Tier 1 versus independent living. *The number of ADLs and IADLs listed here provides a general guide. A person who has more difficulty with ADLs and IADLs than represented here, but who has natural supports available to provide regular, consisten t assistance, might be able to be served at this tier rather than at a higher tier. On the other hand, a person with the same number of ADLs and IADLs in question might need a higher (or lower) tier, depending on the severity of his or her needs. Tier 2 For this tier, the goal should be to move to Tier 1 (or straight to independent living, if need is four (4) IADLs) by reducing the need for continuing ADL assistance, while considering social needs and the resulting proper timing of moving to new residence; residential staff should be part of the clinical team \u2014 in recovery planning, etc. This tier is not available in a Group Home. In order to ensure that beneficiaries have a choice of Day services, beneficiaries on ACT/ICM teams will be served by the ACT/ICM team during the day. Tier 2 beneficiaries on ACT/ICM teams may choose to receive Night services from the Communi ty-based Residential Alternatives providers. If a beneficiary chooses to not receive ACT/ICM or is not eligible for ACT/ICM, he or she may receive Community -based Residential Alternatives during the day and/or night, as necessary to promote recovery and as outlined on the Recovery Plan. This service is provided in Supervised Apartments up to 18 months. A beneficiary requires: Low intensity supervision with staff on site or available to ensure safety from harm as determined by an assessment, OR Provision of care by an Unlicensed Practitioner depending on the assessment and the Recovery Plan, AND Management of one (1) or more behaviors that prevent or interfere with the beneficiary's inclusion in home and family life or community life, OR Hands -on assistance or cueing for at least two (2) ADLs, OR Hands -on assistance or cueing with at least four (4) IADLs, OR Instruction in accessing and using community resources such as transportation, translation, and communication assistance related to a Habilitative outcome and services to assist the beneficiary in shopping and other necessary activities of community and civic life, including self-advocacy, OR Instruction in developing or maintaining financial stability and security (e.g., understanding budgets, managing money, and the right to manage their own money).

Medical Necessity Criteria for Tier 2 ASAM Criteria Low immediate need on ASAM: 1. Substance Abuse: can have \"some difficulty\" (third choice in the list of potential statuses). 2. Biomedical: no known or stable. 3. Suicidality: can have up to \"has frequent\" (#2). 3. Suicidality: control/impulsivity \u2014 low. 3. Dangerousness: can have history, but not current. 3. Self -care: requires assistance in personal care, life skills \u2014 must assess number of ADLs/IADLs needed and must meet PROMISE service description criteria. 3. Psychological/Emotional Health: any level. 4. Readiness to Change: any level, but does participate in treatment in community. 5. Relapse, etc.: all but fourth choice (\"not taking prescribed medications...\"). Independent Living Inquiry Initial or continual assistance for two (2) ADLs OR initial or continual assistance with four (4) IADLs is needed*. Community Living Questionnaire Person's preference (Q2) \u2014 helps in goal setting, recovery planning, and assessment. *The number of ADLs and IADLs listed here provides a general guide. A person who has more difficulty with ADLs and IADLs than represented here, but who has natural supports available to provide regular, consisten t assistance, might be able to be served at this tier rather than at a higher tier. On the other hand, a person with the same number of ADLs and IADLs in question might need a higher (or lower) tier, depending on the severity of his or her needs. Model 2 \u2014 Intensive Supports for Medically Fragile Beneficiaries (Tiers 3 and 4) Tier 3 For this tier, the goal could be to remain in Group Home versus Nursing Home, as long as possible, or to move to Tier 2 if biomedical need is not permanent. This tier could be in a Supervised Apartment or Group Home. Beneficiaries on ACT teams may not be in Group Homes at this tier and should be transitioned off the ACT team immediately. *Tier 3 is for people with medically fragile beneficiaries at least one (1) st aff person during regular business hours should be a nurse. This tier focuses on people with medical needs. Beneficiaries in this level of Community -based Residential Alternatives have medical needs that prohibit their residing more independently. The staf f person who is covering in the evenings should have the basic capacity to deal with medical issues that arise. In this tier, the Group home is expected to meet all physical needs of the client within the rate provided. This tier is not eligible for PLUS LTC (i.e., not eligible for PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 30 Nursing Facility level of care). Group Home or Supervised Apartment: short -term to long-term, depending on acute versus chronic. A beneficiary requires: Supervision with staff on site to ensure safety from harm as determined by an assessment. Intermittent skilled care of a Licensed Professional or Paraprofessional throughout the day for medical diagnosis or medical treatment. Management of one (1) or more behaviors of a disruptive or destructive nature that prevent or interfere with the beneficiary's inclusion in home and family life or community life, AND/OR Hands -on assistance or cueing with at least two (2) ADLs or periodic assistance throughout a day with at least three (3) ADLs, OR Complete assistance with at least four (4) IADLs.

Biomedical: \"current/unstable\". 3. Suicidality: any level, but doesn't need acute. 3. Suicidality: control/impulsivity \u2014 moderate to high. 3. Dangerousness: can have moderate -high risk. 3. Self-care: any level, but will tend to not seek treatment without assistance, and require assistance in personal care, life skills (see PROMISE service descriptions), or other ASAM items checked. 3. Psychological/Emotional Health: any level. 4. Readiness to Change: any level. 5. Relapse, etc.: any level. Independent Living Inquiry \u2014 Special Attention to Biomedical Need Hands -on assistance or cueing with at least two (2) ADLs or periodic assistance throughout a day with at least three (3) ADLs, or complete assistance with at least four (4) IADLs. Community Living Questionnaire Person's preference (Q2) \u2014 helps in goal setting, recovery planning, and assessment. Tier 3 Staffing \u2014 Supervised Apartment At the highest level (Tier 2) with beneficiary supports from outside providers on the Recovery Plan to address individual assessed needs. The total cost of CPST, PSR, Habilitation, Nursing, and Personal Care (including supports by an ACT/ICM or CRISP team) on the Recovery Plan may not to exceed the cost of supports in a Tier 3 Group Home. Beneficiaries in a Group H ome may not receive ICM/ACT so ICM/ACT costs for a beneficiary in Supervised Apartments will be counted as supports in this model. Tier 3 Staffing \u2014 Beneficiaries in a Group Home The service provider shall maintain the following staffing pattern: For Group Homes up to five (5) residents, the rates support 7.58 FTE, including 2.0 FTE for Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) and 5.58 FTE for Clinicians (1.0 FTE Residence Manager, 0.08 FTE Psychiatrist, 3.0 FTE bachelor's level, 1.5 RNs).

Except as permitted in accordance with requirements contained in DHSS guidance, policy, and regulations, this service may not be provided on the same day and at the same time as services that contain elements i ntegral to the delivery of this service. This service may not be included on the same Recovery Plan as the following services: Nursing, Home Health Aide, Personal Care, IADL/Chore, Non-medical Transportation (NMT), or Respite. Tier 4 \u2014 Special Care Unit Services For this tier, the goal is to move to any Tier 1 or 2 or independent living, depending on dangerousness risk issues. This tier could be in a Supervised Apartment or Group Home. Beneficiaries on ACT teams may not be in Group Homes at this tier and should be transitioned off the ACT team immediately. Tier 4 is for people who are dangerous, so this tier should be staffed with second Clinician when there are more than five (5) clients in the home; training should highlight the risk assessment and interventions for handling dangerousness, etc. This tier is not eligible for PLUS LTC (i.e., not Nursing Facility eligible). A beneficiary requires: Extensive support and cannot be left alone for any period throughout the day, as determined by an assessment or clinical determination of need for continuous supervision, due to a significant risk for recent or ongoing occurrences of behavior in which the beneficiary is a threat to self or others. Medical Necessity Criteria for Tier 4 ASAM Criteria Can have high immediate need profile: PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 32 1. Substance Abuse: can have current potential (fifth choice). 2. Biomedical: up to \"current/unstable\". 3. Suicidality: any level not needing acute. 3. Suicidality: control/impulsivity \u2014 has moderate -high risk for problems. 3. Dangerousness: highest risk that does not require inpatient. 3.

The total cost of CPST, PSR, Habilitation, Nursing, and Personal Care (including supports by an ACT/ICM or CRISP team) on the Recovery Plan may not to exceed the cost of supports in a Tier 4 Group Home. Beneficiaries in a Group Home may not receive ICM/ACT so ICM/ACT costs for a beneficiary in Supervised Apartments will be counted as supports in this model.* Clients must be on clinical teams (e.g., ACT or ICM) that can provide 24 -hour back -up to on site staff. The ACT/ICM/CRISP team provides all Day services \u2014 the Community -based Residential Alternatives provider does not provide Day Supports. All staff must be trained in and have demonstrated competence in managing dangerousness.

This service may not be included on the same Recovery Plan as the following services: Nursing, Home Health Aide, Personal Care, IADLs/Chore, NMT, or Respite. An RN is on call at all times there is not an RN/Physician on duty. Tier 5 \u2014 Meet a Nursing Facility Level of Care and Beneficiary is in PROMISE and PLUS LTC PLUS Long -term Care MCO Manager and the PROMISE Care Manager will develop a combined PLUS service care plan and PROMISE Recoveryr Plan with the beneficiary to meet extraordinary physical needs. PLUS LTC can reimburse for extraordinary needs. Tier 5 beneficiari es are eligible for Nursing Facility level of care. PROMISE pays the Tier 4 rate and then the PLUS LTC develops a PLUS service care plan under the PLUS LTC program to provide additional supports under the PLUS program necessary to maintain a beneficiary meeting the Nursing Facility level of care outside of the Nursing Facility. Specify applicable (if any) limits on the amount, frequency, or duration of this service: Additional medical necessity criteria for receiving the service, if applicable (specify): In addition to the medical necessity criteria outlined within each tier above, the following are criteria for determining medical necessity for Community -based Residential Alternatives In assessing the beneficiary's need for Community -based Residential Alternatives, the Care Manager needs to use careful clinical/functional assessment, in combination with consideration of preferences and the recovery environment, in order to identify the appropriate levels and types of care. At a minimum, the following factors need to be considered in combination: The beneficiary's preferences for housing: The beneficiary's preferences need to be considered when identifying the appropriate levels and types of Residential support. Sometimes, the beneficiary may prefer a housing option (e.g., apartment) at a level of care that clinical and housing experts believe would create a health and safety risk, (i.e., where the person's needed level of care is higher than the preferred housing option). If this occurs, the Care Manager and beneficiary should complete a risk assessment as outlined in the Care Manager manual and the recovery plan should identify the services, activities, and supports that can be mobilized in order to achieve the b eneficiary's preference. Note: Group Home rates for beneficiaries at Tier 1 and Tier 2 will not be created and reimbursement is not expected to continue for facilities when it is not medically necessary for the beneficiary to be in that environment. In cases where the beneficiary prefers a higher level of care than others believe the PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 34 beneficiary needs, the beneficiary should be encouraged to find other ways of meeting needs (e.g., for socialization) that are addressed by the higher level of care. The beneficiary Recovery Plan should provide an explicit, detailed plan for addressing those issues as well as the transition plan with deadlines and outcomes for the beneficiary to move to the appropriate housing opt ion (e.g., from Group Home to apartment in a timely manner). The natural supports or environment in which the beneficiary is recovering: Residential Alternatives should not supplant natural supports. Some beneficiaries whose individual capacities alone mig ht indicate a higher level of care should receive lower Residential Support tiers because natural supports are available to ensure the beneficiary's success in housing options at a lower level of care tier. For example, a beneficiary might have several IADLs that indicate a need for Tier 2, but she has family members and/or friends who are available on a regular basis to help her achieve those IADLs. This beneficiary might be placed in Tier 1 or even Tier 0. Landlords also are an important part o f the recovery environment, and some landlords are more flexible than others in tolerating the challenges and limitations beneficiaries sometimes bring to the Residential setting. The beneficiary's abilities and limitations related to living in the community. The severity of any functional limitation related to an ADL or IADL should be incorporated. Two beneficiaries may both be identified as having a need for assistance with personal hygiene, but one beneficiary's inability might represent a signifi cant health risk, while the other beneficiary's inability might merely represent an occasional risk to the quality of interactions with people who do not know the person very well. The severity of functional limitation may not just rely on the beneficiary' s own self -report concerning her or his abilities and limitations in community living. It is important to bolster self -reports with the observations of collaterals (family members and other people in the beneficiary's natural support network, as well as pr oviders who know the beneficiary well). Every beneficiary's self -report (not just the self -report of someone coping with a SMI) is limited, and it is always the case that observations of other people who know us well help round out an assessment. Sometimes , direct observations of behaviors that are associated with successful community living will also be important in establishing an accurate assessment. Back -Up Plans: Residential supports should not be used as substitutes for an effective back -up plan. ACT and ICM teams should provide 24/7 on -call services. Beneficiaries on ACT teams are able to live more independently than they would otherwise be able to live, due to the regular assistance of the ACT teams in providing training and support for independe nt living. It is assumed that all beneficiaries with Tier 1 needs on an ACT/ICM team will not receive Community -based Residential Alternatives (i.e., effectively Tier 0). Beneficiary Recovery Plans must include provisions for ensuring the beneficiary's success in community living, in case the original or initial plan needs to be revised. For beneficiaries in Tier 2 receiving ACT, who are in Supervised Apartments, there may be staff at the residence who will provide Community -based Residential Alternatives during off hours. For example, if a beneficiary's plan in the area of Community -based Residential Alternatives is contingent, in part, on the availability of a family member or other person from the natural support system to assist with certain behaviors, a nd that person is not available for a period of time, a \"back -up plan\" needs to be in place to ensure there is not significant disruption in the beneficiary's living situation. Part of the \"back -up plan\" could include specific activities or interventions a imed at helping bolster the beneficiary's own abilities in the area of independent living. Family members, friends, residential neighbors, companions from faith communities and other voluntary organizations, and peers from mutual/self -help organizations represent examples of natural supports that might be identified and mobilized to ensure that any Residential support needs are met during off hours. All beneficiaries in Tiers 1 -4 Community -based Residential Alternatives have SMI. Tier 0 is for beneficiaries with SRAP vouchers who only need temporary housing. No Community - based Residential Alternatives are provided. Tiers 1-2 are for beneficiaries NOT high on an ASAM Immediate Need profile. Tier 2 -A is to be utilized for beneficiaries who have not yet been assessed for PROMISE, but are referred because they are presumed to be eligible for PROMISE. Beneficiaries should be assessed by Care Managers for PROMISE prior to leaving State Hospitals. These are considered emergency placements only. Tier 2 -A = Resource beds: 1 -3 months. A = Assessment. Goal is for Care Manager to assess beneficiary, develop Recovery Plan, and assist the beneficiary with implementing more permanent services within 1-3 months. Note: Care Manager should have assessment and Recovery PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 35 Plan completed within 30 days of referral to program, and Recovery Plan should be implemented within 45 days of Recovery Plan approval by EEU. Tiers 3-4 include some people high on ASAM Immediate Need profile. ASAM Dimension 3 (self -care, dangerousness, etc.) must be used in conjunction with health record review and interview with collaterals (e.g., providers) to assess specific level of risk (e.g., number of ADLs/IADL s) the beneficiary needs assistance with, and dangerousness (to assess need for Tier 4): \u2014 ASAM is important for determining need for Tier 4 (with dangerousness being the most important dimension for consideration). \u2014 In combination with the Community Living Questionnaire and data from collaterals/health record, ASAM is helpful in determining need for Tier 3, based on biomedical need. Community Living Questionnaire should not only help with placement, but should aid in individualized Community -based Residential Alternatives planning for all four (4) tiers and should help provide prognosis for length of stay (which can vary considerable within tiers): \u2014 Independent Living with in-home supports versus Tier 1 Group Home placement \u2014 based on beneficiary's preference. When there is a need for IADL/ADL assistance, could lead to either placement. \u2014 When beneficiary is in need of Tier 3 Group Home due to physical health/medical risk issues. \u2014 Specific needs for Group Home Habilitative and Reh abilitative supports and for IADL/Chore services. \u2014 Based on preferences (e.g., Q4), goals to set in the Recovery Plan, how to assess and review progress with the beneficiary; also, provides basis for motivating when work on ADLs/IADLs is difficult. However, interviewing collaterals (family members, providers) and reviewing the health record for additional data will be needed in most cases in order to fully assess need for IADLs and ADLs. Services that are provided by third parties must be coordinated with the Residential services provider, including Community -based Rehabilitative services provided outside of the residence. Personal Care services are provided in facilities as part of the Community -based Residential service. To avoid duplicat ion, Personal Care (as a separate service) is not available to beneficiaries receiving Residential services. These services are provided to beneficiaries residing in homes that have no more than nine (9) other residents and with home and community -based characteristics. Residential services may only be funded through the waiver when the services are not covered by the State Plan, Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPDST), or a responsible third -party, such as Medicare or private insurance. Care Managers must assure that coverage of services provided under the State Plan, EPSDT, or a responsible third -party continues until the plan limitations have been reached or a determination of non -coverage has been established pri or to this service's inclusion in the Recovery Plan. Documentation in accordance with DHSS requirements must be maintained in the beneficiary's file by the Care Manager and updated with each reauthorization, as applicable. Except as permitted in accordance with requirements contained in DHSS guidance, policy, and regulations, this service may not be provided on the same day and at the same time as services that contain elements integral to the delivery of this service. This service may not be incl uded on the same Recovery Plan as the following services: Nursing, Home Health Aide, Personal Care, IADL/Chore, NMT, or Respite. Residential services should be provided only in facilities meeting home and community -based characteristic requirements and cannot be provided in the following settings or in settings located on the grounds of these facilities: Nursing Facility. IMD. ICF for beneficiaries with IDD. Hospital providing long-term care or services. Any other location that has qualities of an institutional setting, as determined by DHSS. Room and Board is excluded from this service. This service must be delivered in Delaware. The Care Manager must ensure that the provider maintains documentation and that the Care Manager monitor s the services on an ongoing basis to ensure that the health and welfare of the beneficiary is met and the Recovery Plan goals are achieved. The documentation must be available to the Care Manager for monitoring at all times, on an ongoing basis . Documentation in accordance with DHSS requirements must PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 36 be maintained in the beneficiary's file by the Care Manager and updated with each reauthorization, as applicable. If the monitoring suggests that a change in tiers is needed, the Care Manager will recommend a re - assessment to re -evaluate the beneficiary to determine the appropriateness of the assigned tier in accordance with DHSS requirements. The service provider must maintain documentation in accordance with DHSS requirements. T he Care Manager will monitor the community character of the residence during regularly scheduled contact with the beneficiary. All the facilities are community -based with a home -like environment providing access to typical home facilities and integrated into the community. Monthly visits will also ensure that the facility maintains a community character at each monthly visit. Community character means that a provider -owned facility ensures that persons are encouraged and afforded the opportunity to exercise their options of when and where to take community outings, have freedom to choose roommates, and are free to exercise personal choices as are other persons who do not qualify for services under the PROMISE program. Beneficiaries participating through Permanent Supported Housing will have freedom to choose their service providers. Beneficiaries will be encouraged to have control over their meal and sleep times, visitor access, privacy, room decorations, and ability to engage freely in the community. Results of this monitoring will be reported to DHSS.

Beneficiaries in a competitive employment arra ngement receiving IESSs are compensated at or above the minimum wage and receive similar wages and levels of benefits paid by the employer for the same or similar work performed by beneficiaries without disabilities. IESSs are necessary, as specified in the Recovery Plan, to support the beneficiary to live and work successfully in home and community -based settings, enable the beneficiary to integrate more fully into the community, and ensure the health, welfare, and safety of the beneficiary. Supported Employment may also include support to establish or maintain self -employment, including home -based self -employment. Supported Employment services are individualized and may include any combination of the following services: ongoing vocational/job -related discovery or assessment not otherwise covered in the annual career planning, ongoing person -centered employment planning not otherwise covered in the annual career planning, job placement, job development negotiation with prospective employers, job analysis, job carving, training and systematic instruction, individual supports, benefits support training, planning, transportation, asset development and career advancement services, implementation of assistive technology, and other workf orce support services including services not specifically related to job skill training that enable the waiver beneficiary to be successful in integrating into the job setting.

This employment planning includes engaging a beneficiary in identifying a career direction and dev eloping a plan for achieving competitive, integrated employment at or above the State's minimum wage. The outcome of this activity is identification of the beneficiary's career objective and development of a career plan used to guide beneficiary to gain competitive employment. Competitive or customized integrated employment, including self -employment, shall be considered the first option when serving beneficiaries with disabilities who are of working age. IESSs adopt a \"rapid job search\" approach to achieving competitive employment and services planned do not assume that a beneficiary must achieve greater readiness for competitive employment before competitive employment is sought. Supported Employment may provide work experiences where the beneficiar y can develop strengths and skills that contribute to employability in paid employment in integrated community settings. IESS includes supervision, monitoring, training, education, demonstration, or support to assist with the acquisition and retention of s kills and training and education in self -determination.

IESS provides and supports the acquisition of skills necessary to enable the beneficiary t o obtain competitive, integrated work where the compensation for the beneficiary is at or above the minimum wage, but not less than the customary wage and level of benefits paid by the employer for the same or similar work performed by beneficiaries withou t disabilities, which is considered to be the optimal outcome of IESS.

Work incentives planning involves helping the beneficiary review her or his options for working (number of hours per week, etc.), given the hourly pay the beneficiary's being offered, or is likely to be offered, the beneficiary's current income needs, and the rules concerning how Social Security Admin istration benefits, medical benefits, medical subsidies, and other subsidies (housing, food stamps, etc.) change based on income from paid employment. (This includes providing information on Ticket to Work, etc.).

Assisting beneficiaries in making informed decisions about whether to disclose their mental illness condition to employers and co-workers.

Once the beneficiary is stable in the position, EFA will ensue. EFA EFA is ongoing support av ailable for an indefinite period as needed by the beneficiary to maintain their paid employment position once they have been stabilized in their position (generally receiving on site support once per month or less). EFA support may include reminders of eff ective workplace practices and reinforcement of skills gained during the period of IIESS. Specify applicable (if any) limits on the amount, frequency, or duration of this service: IESS may not be rendered to a beneficiary eligible for services under a program funded by either the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the IDEA, or any other small business development resource available to the beneficiary (e.g., during the job placement phase or the first 90 days of placement if the Vocational Rehabilitation State agency is reimbursing the Supported Employment provider) This service must occur in integrated settings and may not occur in non-integrated settings.

PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 70 Personal Care Service Specification Service Title: Personal Care Service Definition (Scope): Personal Care includes care with ADLs (e.g., bathing, dressing, personal hygiene, transferring, toileting, skin care, eating, and assisting with mobility). When specified in the Recovery Plan, this service includes care with IADLs (e.g., light housekeeping, chores, shopping, meal preparation). Care with IADLs must be essential to the health and welfare of the beneficiary based on the assessment of the Care Manager and identified within the Recovery Plan as a goal that was identified by the beneficiary. Input should also be obtained from the beneficiary's family or other natural supports, when appropriate and desired by the beneficiary. Personal Care services primarily provide hands -on Personal Care to beneficiaries that reside in a private home and that are necessary, as specified in the Recovery Plan, to enable the beneficiary to integrate more fully into the community and ensure the health, welfare, and safety of the beneficiary. This service will be provided to meet the beneficiary's needs, as determined by an assessment, in accordance with DHSS requirements and as outlined in the beneficiary's Recovery Plan. If there is more than one (1) staff member on site at the residence during normal hours who can provide Personal Care services, the provider and beneficiary will be encouraged to hire staff to deliver Personal Care services separate from staff who provide Habilitation services that involved the development of ADL and IADL skills. This will ensure that the clinical boundary issues that would otherwise complicate Habilitation services (if the same staff were also delivering Personal Care services) will be mitigated. Perso nal Care services are aimed at assisting the beneficiary with completing ADLs that would be performed independently if they had no disability. These services include: Assisting with ADLs (e.g., eating, bathing, dressing, personal hygiene), cueing to prompt the beneficiary to perform a task, and providing supervision to assist a beneficiary who cannot be safely left alone. Health maintenance, such as bowel and bladder routines, ostomy care, catheter, wound care and range of motion, as indicated in the beneficiary's Recovery Plan and permitted under applicable State requirements. Routine Support services, such as meal planning, keeping of medical appointments, and other health regimens needed to support the beneficiary. Care and implementation of prescribed therapies. Overnight Personal Care services to provide intermittent or ongoing awake, overnight care to a beneficiary in their home for up to eight (8) hours. Overnight Personal Care services require awake staff. Personal Care may include care with the following activities when incidental to Personal Care and necessary to complete ADLs: Activities that are incidental to the delivery of the personal care to assure the health, welfare, and safety of the beneficiary, such as changing linens, doing the dishes associated with the preparation of a meal, and laundering towels from bathing may be provided and must not comprise the majority of the service. Services to accompany the beneficiary into the community for purposes related to Personal Care, such as shopping in a grocery store, picking up medications, and providing care with any of the activities noted above to enable the completion of those tasks. Services must be delivered in a manner that supports the beneficiary' s communication needs including, but not limited to, age appropriate communication, translation/Interpretation services for beneficiaries that are of limited -English proficiency, or who have other communication needs requiring translation, and assistance with the provider's understanding and use of communication devices used by the beneficiary. The Personal Care service provider must maintain documentation in accordance with DHSS requirements. The documentation must be available to the Care Mana ger for monitoring at all times on an ongoing basis. The Care Manager will monitor on a quarterly basis to see if the objectives and outcomes are being met. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 71 Specify applicable (if any) limits on the amount, frequency, or duration of this service: Personal Care services may not be billed at the same time as Respite or IADL/Chore services. Personal Care services are provided only during those times when neither the beneficiary nor anyone else in the household is able or available to provide them, and where no other relative, caregiver, community/volunteer agency, or third-party payer is able to provide, or be responsible for, their provision. Personal Care services in excess of 12 hours per day will require prior approval by DHSS. Additional medical necessity criteria for receiving the service, if applicable (specify): Medical necessity criteria include the following: The service is recommended by the Care Manager and the beneficiary in collaboration, and the service is included in the beneficiary's Recovery Plan, AND The service is needed to allow the beneficiary the best opportunity to remain in the community, AND The tasks required are unable to be completed by the beneficiary or paid or unpaid caregiver, AND The beneficiary is not residing in a community -based Group Home, AND The frequency and intensity of the service aligns with the unique needs of the beneficiary (see examples below), AND For beneficiaries also enrolled in DSHP Plus, the Recovery Plan clearly identifies the types of services needed that are in addition to what is already being provided by DSHP Plus. Examples of the need for Personal Care services include: A beneficiary has established a goal to engage in more social activities and to strengthen her social network of friends. However, she struggles with maintaining good personal hygiene due to lack of energy, focus, and poor self -hygiene. This negatively inter feres with goals for social interaction and Personal Care has been identified as necessary to provide daily assistance with bathing, dressing, and personal hygiene. A beneficiary has the goal of living independently, but struggles with debilitating and rec urring nightmares that can trigger thoughts of self-harm. He believes overnight Personal Care services could offer the necessary support and supervision he needs to ensure his safety, while still allowing him to live in his own home. A beneficiary has a goal of preparing meals for herself regularly and for her friends a couple of times each month. She believes her preoccupation with germs/potential contamination interfere with her ability to shop for food and prepare meals. She has ident ified that Personal Care services, made available three (3) times per week to accompany her to the grocery store, and daily to assist her with meal preparation, would help her make significant progress in achieving her goal. Except as permitted in accordance with requirements contained in DHSS guidance, policy, and regulations, this service may not be provided on the same day and at the same time as services that contain elements integral to the delivery of this service. This service is not availabl e to beneficiaries residing in Assisted Living or receiving Residential Alternatives. Personal Care services may only be on the same Recovery Plan as Assisted Living or Residential Alternatives in limited circumstances, as approved by DHSS, such as Persona l Care necessary to support a beneficiary in a work environment. Costs incurred by the Personal Care service workers that relate to accompanying a beneficiary in the community or accessing other services are not reimbursable under the waiver as Personal Care services (e.g., tickets to a movie or ball game). The transportation costs associated with the provision of Personal Care outside the beneficiary's home must be billed separately and may not be included in the scope of Personal Care. Personal Care workers may furnish and bill separately for Transportation provided they meet the State's provider qualifications for Transportation services, whether Medical Transportation under the State Plan or NMT under the waiver. To the extent that integration into the community and recover -oriented goals are the primary focus of the activity provided, the beneficiary and Care Manager may want to utilize Peer Support resources on the Recovery Plan instead of Personal Care. If the goals are solely Personal Care in nature, Peers Support should not be utilized to provide the service. The Care Manager must ensure that the provider maintains documentation and that the Care Manager monitors the services on an ongoing basis to ensure that the health and welfare of the beneficiary is met and the Recovery Plan goals are achieved. The documentation must be available to the Care Manager for monitoring at all times, on an ongoing basis . Documentation in accordance with DHSS requirements must PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 72 be maintained in the beneficiary's file by the Care Manager and updated with each reauthorization, as applicable.

PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 81 Respite Service Specification Service Title: Respite Service Definition (Scope): Respite includes services provided to beneficiaries unable to care for themselves, furnished on a short -term basis because of the absence or need for relief of those persons who normally provide care for the beneficiary. Respite may be provided in an emergency to prevent hospitalization. Respite provides planned or emergency short -term r elief to a beneficiary's unpaid caregiver or principle caregiver who is unavailable to provide support. This service will be provided to meet the beneficiary's needs as determined by an assessment performed in accordance with DHSS requirements, and as outl ined in the beneficiary's Recovery Plan. Beneficiaries are encouraged to receive Respite in the most integrated and cost -effective settings appropriate to meet their Respite needs. Respite services may include the following activities: Assistance with the beneficiary's social interaction, use of natural supports and typical community services available to all people, and participation in volunteer activities. Activities to improve the beneficiary's capacity to perform or assist with ADLs and IADLs. On site modeling of behavior, behavior support, intensive behavior episode intervention, training, cueing, and/or supervision. Respite 15-minute Unit Respite (15-minute unit) may be provided in the beneficiary's home or out of the beneficiary's home (not in a facility) in units of 15 -minutes, for up to 12 hours a day. It is intended to provide short -term Respite. Respite Per Diem Respite (per diem) may be provided in a facility on a per diem basis. It is intended to provide short -term Respite. Services must be delivered in a manner that supports the beneficiary's communication needs including, but not limited to, age appropriate communication, translation/Interpretation services for beneficiaries that are of limited -English proficiency, or who have other commun ication needs requiring translation, and assistance with the provider's understanding and use of communication devices used by the beneficiary. If the beneficiary is to receive respite on an ongoing basis, the Care Manager will monitor on a quarterly basis, as applicable, to see if the objectives and outcomes are being met. Specify applicable (if any) limits on the amount, frequency, or duration of this service: Respite services may not be billed at the same time as Personal Care or IADL/Chore services. This service is limited to no more than 14 days per year, regardless of funding source. DHSS may authorize service request expectations above these limits on a case -by-case basis when it is determined that: No other service options are available to the beneficiary, including services provided through an informal support network. The absence of the service would present a significant health and welfare risk to the beneficiary. Respite service provided in a Nursing Home, Group Home, or Assisted Living facilities is not utilized to replace or relocate a beneficiary's primary residence. Room and Board in a Nursing Facility and Group Home may be paid for by Medicaid for Respite service only. Additional medical necessity criteria for receiving the service, if applicable (specify): The service is recommended by the Care Manager and the beneficiary in collaboration, and the service is included in the beneficiary's Recovery Plan, AND There are emotional and/or behavioral problems which stress the ability of the caregiver or beneficiary to provide for the beneficiary's needs in the home thus putting the beneficiary at risk of requiring a more intensive level of care (e.g., strained family relationships, exhaustio n in caregiver, caregiver struggles to meet other work/family responsibilities or lacks enough time to care for self needs, increased symptoms of mental illness or substance use, such as psychotic thinking, sleeplessness, or self-injurious behavior) OR the primary caregiver has a time limited situation that necessitates assistance in providing care for PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 82 the beneficiary (e.g., caregiver is experiencing an acute medical problem, caregiver must attend to a family crisis), AND The absence of the service would present a significant health and welfare risk to the beneficiary (e.g., beneficiary has a seizure disorder, beneficiary needs assistance with medication administration, beneficiary has difficulty appropriately regulating water intake), No other means of temporary care exists, AND For beneficiaries also enrolled in DSHP Plus, the Recovery Plan clearly identifies the types of services needed that are in addition to what is already being provided by DSHP Plus, AND The frequency and intensity of the service aligns with the unique situation of the beneficiary and/or caregiver. Examples include: \u2014 A caregiver requests Respite for a particular weekend so he can have a break and visit family members out of State. \u2014 A beneficiary has a goal on her Recovery Plan to appropriately limit her water intake, since it has led to electrolyte imbalances numerous times in the past, and agrees that she continues to need support in order to achieve that goal. As a result, she and he r sister (who she lives with) have identified the need for pre-planned Respite services one (1) afternoon each month so the sister can go to a movie or shopping alone. \u2014 A caregiver has identified the immediate need for Respite services for up to a week be cause the beneficiary has been awake most of the night for the last three (3) nights, resulting in the caregiver being awake as well and unable to go to work. The caregiver believes the beneficiary's mood and sleep cycle will normalize in about a week, as it has done many times before, but Respite will allow the beneficiary to avoid a higher level of care and will provide a needed break for the caregiver. The Care Manager must ensure that the provider maintains documentation and that the Care Manager monitors the services on an ongoing basis to ensure that the health and welfare of the beneficiary is met and the Recovery Plan goals are achieved. The documentation must be available to the Care Manager for monitoring at all times, on an ongoing basis .

PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 89 Short Term Small Group Supported Employment Service Specification Service Title: Short Term Small Group Supported Employment (STSGSE) Service Definition (Scope): STSGSE services provide support to beneficiaries to gain skills to enable transition to integrated, competitive employment. This service is provided instead of IESS only when the beneficiary specifically chooses this service over IESS, based on a desire to work in a group context or to earn income more quickly than might be possible with an individualized, rapid job search through IESS. STSGSE is services and training activities provided in regular business, industry, and community settings for groups of tw o (2) to four (4) workers with disabilities. Examples include mobile crews and other employment work groups. STSGSE must be provided in a manner that promotes integration into the workplace and interaction between beneficiaries and people without disabilit ies in those workplaces. The outcome of this service is sustained paid employment and work experience leading to further career development, and beneficiary integrated community -based employment. Within this service, the beneficiary is compensated at or above minimum wage, but not less than the customary wage and level of benefits paid by the employer for the same or similar work performed by beneficiaries without disabilities. STSGSE may be a combination of the following services: on -the-job supports, initial and ongoing employment planning and advancement, employment assessment not otherwise covered in the annual career planning, job placement, job development, negotiation with prospective employers, job analysis, training and systematic inst ruction, job coaching, benefits supports training, and planning transportation. If the beneficiary has received a career assessment that has determined that the beneficiary is in need of acquiring particular skills in order to enhance their employability, those identified skill development areas must be addressed within the beneficiary's Recovery Plan and by the STSGSE. Beneficiaries receiving this service must have an employment outcome goal included in their Recovery Plan. On-the-job support includes: on site job training, assisting the beneficiary to develop natural supports in the workplace, coordinating with employers and coworkers, as necessary, to assist the beneficiary in meeting employment expectations, and addressing issues as they ari se. Other workplace support services may include services not specifically related to job skill training that enable the waiver beneficiary to be successful in integrating in to the job setting. STSGSE includes person -centered, comprehensive employment pla nning and support service that provides assistance for waiver program beneficiaries to obtain, maintain, or advance in competitive employment or self-employment. This employment planning includes engaging a beneficiary in identifying a career direction and developing a plan for achieving competitive, integrated employment at or above the State's minimum wage. The outcome of this activity is documentation of the beneficiary's stated career objective and a career plan used to guide beneficiary employment support. STSGSE emphasizes the importance of rapid job search for a competitive job and provide work experiences where the beneficiary can develop strengths and skills that contribute to employability in individualized paid employment in integrate d community settings. STSGSE includes the provision of scheduled activities outside of a beneficiary's home that support acquisition, retention, or improvement in self-care, sensory -motor development, socialization, daily living skills, communication, comm unity living, and social skills. STSGSE includes supervision, monitoring, training, education, demonstration, or support to assist with the acquisition and retention of skills and training and education in self -determination. Skills development, as a part of placement and training, may occur as a one -on-one training experience in accordance with DHSS requirements. STSGSE will be utilized for a beneficiary to gain work related experience considered crucial for job placement (e.g., unpa id internship). STSGSE provides and supports the acquisition of skills necessary to enable the beneficiary to obtain competitive, integrated work where the compensation for the beneficiary is at or above the minimum wage, but not less than the customary wage and level of benefits paid by the employer for the same or similar work performed by beneficiaries without disabilities, which is considered to be the optimal outcome of STSGSE. Services must be delivered in a manner that supports the beneficiary's comm unication needs including, but not limited to, age appropriate communication, translation/Interpretation services for beneficiaries that are of limited -English proficiency, or who have other communication needs requiring translation, and assistance with the provider's understanding and use of communication devices used by the beneficiary.

The STSGSE service provider must maintain documentation in accordance with DHSS requirements. The documentation must be available to the Care Manager for monitoring at all times on an ongoing basis. The Care Manager will monitor on a quarterly basis to see if the objectives and outcomes are being met. Competitive and integrated employment, including self -employment, shall be considered the first option when serving persons with disabilities who are of working age. Specify applicable (if any) limits on the amount, frequency, or duration of this service: STSGSE may not be rendered to a beneficiary eligible for such services under a program funded by either the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, or the IDEA, or any other small business development resource available to the beneficiary. Documentation in accordance with DHSS requirements must be maintained in the file by the Care Manager and updated with each reauthorization to satisfy the State assurance that the service is not otherwise available to the beneficiary under other federal programs. Prior authorization for STSGSE is required. Documentation must be provided that STSGSE is the beneficiary's preference among employment options and/or that it enabled the beneficiary to achieve a stated goal of quickly obtaining income from employment. Continuation of STSGSE requires a review and reauthorization every six (6) months in accordance with DHSS requirements, and shall not exceed 12 continuous months without obtaining information from an employment assessment and/or exploration of alternative services. The review and reauthorization should verify that there have been appropriate attempts to prepare the beneficiary for a transition to IESS and that the beneficiary continues to prefer STSGSE, despite these attemp ts. Except as permitted in accordance with requirements contained in DHSS guidance, policy, and regulations, this service may not be provided on the same day and at the same time as services that contain elements integral to the delivery of this service. This service must occur in integrated settings and may not occur in non-integrated settings. STSGSE services do not include volunteer work and may not be for job placements paying below minimum wage. Federal Financial Participation is not claimed for incentive payments, subsidies, or unrelated vocational training expenses such as the following: Incentive payments made to an employer to encourage or subsidize the employer's participation in STSGSE services.

PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 93 Appendices: Certification Detail for Evidence -Based Practices under PROMISE PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 94 Appendix 1: Delaware State Standards for Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Services Please refer to DSAMH's website for the most updated version: https://www.dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dsamh/files/ACTStandards.pdf Version III -B August 9, 2019 OVERVIEW This manual contains the standards by which the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health (DSAMH) certifies Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) for persons with psychiatric disabilities. Certification is required for provider enrollment with the Division of Social Services, Delaware Division of Medicaid and Medical Assistance (DMMA) Program for Medicaid reimbursement through the rehabilitative services option of Title XIX of the Social Security Amendments. Through an Inter -Divisional Agreement, the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health has been delegated authority for administration of certain provisions of the Medicaid program pertaining to behavioral health services covered under the rehabilitative services option. These provisions include the following: 1) certification of programs for provider enrollment, 2) rate se tting, and 3) performance improvement. Delegated performance improvement functions include program monitoring, utilization control, training, and technical assistance. The Delaware Medicaid and Medical Assistance Program requires providers of behavioral h ealth rehabilitative services to be certified by DSAMH as a condition of enrollment before they may provide services to eligible Medicaid recipients. Behavioral Health rehabilitative services are medically - related treatment, rehabilitative, and support services for persons with disabilities caused by mental illness and substance use disorders. The Assertive Community Treatment (ACT), Psychosocial Rehabilitation Center (PRC) and Residential Rehabilitation Facility (RRF) are categories of community support programs that the Division certifies as one of the criteria for Medicaid provider enrollment. Services are provided for as long as is medically necessary, to assist service recipients to manage the symptoms of their illnesses, minimize the effects of their disabilities on their capacity for independent living and prevent or eliminate periods of inpatient treatment. 1 CERTIFICATION FOR PROVIDER PARTICIPATION 1.1 Authority - Through an Inter -Divisional Agreement, the Division of Health and Social Services (DHSS) Delaware Medical Assistance Program (DMAP) has delegated the function of certifying organizations for enrollment as providers of optional behavioral health community support services to the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health (Division or DSAMH). 1.2 Certification Criteria - Eligibility for certification to provide community support services is determined according to the following criteria: 1.2.1 Organizations eligible to apply for provider certification and enrollment with DHSS for Medicaid reimbursement of Community Support Services include: 1.2.1.1 Private non-profit human service corporations; PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 95 1.2.1.2 Private for-profit human service corporations. 1.2.2 The Division bases its certification of programs and enrollment recommenda tions to DHSS upon the organization's compliance with state - level organizational, administrative, and program standards that are consistent with federal Medicaid requirements related to Rehabilitative Services. 1.2.3 The Division establishes and applies minimum compliance guidelines to be used in making certification determinations. 1.2.4 The Division uses a certification survey to measure compliance with organizational, administrative, and program standards. The determination with regard to a program's certification is based on: 1.2.4.1 Statements made and certified by authorized representatives of the organization; 1.2.4.2 Documents provided to the Division by the organization; 1.2.4.3 Documented compliance with organizational, program, and administrative standards; 1.2.4.4 On-site observations by surveyor. 2 Definitions ACT (Assertive Community Treatment) Team - is a group of direct service staff, as defined by the Tool for Measurement of Assertive Community Treatment (TMACT, VERSION 1 (REV 3)), who collectively have a range of clinical and rehabilitation skills and expertise. The ACT team members are assigned by the team leader and the psychiatric prescriber to work collaboratively with an individual and his/her family and/or natural supports in the community by the time of the first individual assessment and subsequent person -directed recovery planning meeting. The ACT team size may range from 50 to 125 individuals with staffing maintained at prescribed TMACT, VERSION 1 (REV 3) ratio of 1:10. The co re members of an individual's treatment team are a primary care manager, the psychiatric prescriber, a nurse, and a clinical or rehabilitation staff person who shares case coordination and service provision tasks for each individual. The team has continuou s responsibility to be knowledgeable about the individual's life, circumstances, goals and desires; to collaborate with the individual to develop and write the recovery plan; to offer options and choices in the recovery plan; to ensure that immediate chang es are made as an individual's needs change; and to advocate for the individual's wishes, rights, and preferences.

Team members are assigned to take separate service roles with the individual, as specified by the individual and the person - directed recovery plan. Assistance with medications (AWSAM) - means a situation where a designated care provider who has taken a Board -approved medication training program, or a designated care provider who is otherwise exempt from the requirement of having to take the Board -approved self -administration of medication training program, assists the patient in self -administration of medication other than by injection, provided that the medication is in the original container with a proper label and directions. In cases where medication planners are used, the individual to whom the medication is prescribed PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 96 must fill the planner. The designated care provider may hold the container or planner for the patient, assist with the opening of the container, and assist the patient in taking the medication.

PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 139 Appendix 2: Delaware State Standards for Intensive Care Management (ICM) Services Please refer to DSAMH's website for the most updated version: http://dhss.delaware.gov/dsamh/ OVERVIEW This manual section contains the standards by which the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health (DSAMH) certifies Intensive Care Management (ICM) programs for persons with psychiatric disabilities. Certification is required for provider enrollment with the Division of Social Services, Delaware Division of Medicaid and Medical Assistance (DMMA) Program for Medicaid reimbursement through the rehabilitative service s option of Title XIX of the Social Security Amendments. Through an Inter -Divisional Agreement the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health has been delegated authority for administration of certain provisions of the Medicaid program pertaining to behavioral health services covered under the rehabilitative services option. These provisions include the following: 1) certification of programs for provider enrollment, 2) rate setting, and 3) performance improvement. Delegated performance improvement functions include program monitoring, utilization control, training and technical assistance. The Delaware Medicaid and Medical Assistance Program requires providers of behavioral health rehabilitative services to be certified by DSAMH as a co ndition of enrollment before they may provide services to eligible Medicaid recipients. Behavioral Health rehabilitative services are medically related treatment, rehabilitative and support services for persons with disabilities caused by mental illness, a nd substance use disorders. The Assertive Community Treatment (ACT), Intensive Care Management (ICM), Psychosocial Rehabilitation Center (PRC) and Residential Rehabilitation Facility (RRF) are categories of community support programs that the Division certifies as one of the criteria for Medicaid provider enrollment. Services are provided for as long as is medically necessary to assist service recipients to manage the symptoms of their illnesses, minimize the effects of their disabilities on their capacity for independent living and prevent or eliminate periods of inpatient treatment. 1 CERTIFICATION FOR PROVIDER PARTICIPATION 1.1 Authority - Through an Inter-Divisional Agreement, the Division of Health and Social Services (DHSS) Delaware Medical Assistance Program (DMAP) has delegated the function of certifying organizations for enrollment as providers of optional behavioral health community support services to the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health (Division or DSAMH). 1.2 Certification Criteria - Eligibility for certification to provide community support services is determined according to the following criteria: 1.2.1 Organizations eligible to apply for provider certification and enrollment with DHSS for Medicaid reimbursement of Community Support Services include: 1.2.1.1 Private non-profit human service corporations; 1.2.1.2 Private for-profit human service corporations; PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 140 1.2.2 The Division bases its certification of programs and enrollment recommendations to DHSS upon the organization's compliance with state -level organizational, administrative and program standards that are consistent with federal Medicaid requirements related to Rehabilitative Services. 1.2.3 The Division establishes and applies minimum compliance guidelines to be used in making certification determinations. 1.2.4 The Division uses a certification survey to measure compliance with organizational, administrative and program standards. The determination with regard to a program's certification is based on: 1.2.4.1 Statements made and certified by authorized representatives of the organization; 1.2.4.2 Documents provided to the Division by the organ ization; 1.2.4.3 Documented compliance with organizational, program and administrative standards; 1.2.4.4 On site observations by surveyor. 2 Definitions Assistance with self -administered medications (AWSAM) means a situation where a designated care provider who has taken a Board approved medication training program, or a designated care provider who is otherwise exempt from the requirement of having to take the Board approved self - administration of medication training program, assists the patient in self-administration of medication other than by injection, provided that the medication is in the original container with a proper label and directions. In cases where medication planners are used, the individual to whom the medication is prescribed must f ill the planner. The designated care provider may hold the container or planner for the patient, assist with the opening of the container, and assist the patient in taking the medication. AWSAM is conducted with the individual present. When delivering medications to the individual in the community, medications must be in their original containers or a labeled container with the name of the medication, dosage, dosing directions and name of the psychiatric prescriber prescribing the medication. (Delaware Nurse Practice Act, Title 24 DeI. Code Ch. 19, 1902) Adverse Events are confirmed incidents of abuse, neglect, mistreatment, financial exploitation, and/or significant injuries which require reporting and investigative processes in accordance to DSAMH policies. Atypical Antipsychotic Medications (also known as \"second generation medications) are those medications used in the treatment of individuals d iagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar conditions. BioPsychoSocial (BPS) is an assessment positing that biological, psychological, and social factors are together related as significant factors in human functioning in the context of disease or illness. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 141 Clinical Supervision is a systematic process to review each individual's clinical status and to ensure that the individualized services and interventions that the team members provide (including the peer specialist) are planned with, purposeful for, effective, and satisfactory to the individual. The team leader and the psychiatric prescriber have the responsibility for providing clinical supervision that occurs during daily organizational staff meetings, recovery planning meetings, and in individual meetings with team members. Clinical supervision also includes review of written documentation (e.g., assessments, recovery plans, progress notes, correspondence) in conjunction with each recovery plan review and update, upon an individual r e-entering ACT or ICM services after a hospitalization of 30 days or more or any time there has been a change to the course of service provision as outlined in the most current recovery plan. Comprehensive Assessment is the organized process of gathering and analyzing current and past information with each individual and the family and/or support system and other significant people to evaluate: 1) mental and functional status; 2) effectiveness of past treatment; 3) current treatment, rehabilitation and support needs to achieve individual goals and support recovery; and, 4) the range of individual strengths (e.g., knowledge gained from dealing with adversity, personal/professional roles, talents, personal traits) that can act as resources to the individual a nd his/her recovery planning team in pursuing goals. The results of the information gathering and analysis are used to: 1) establish immediate and longer -term service needs with each individual; 2) set goals and develop the first person directed recovery plan with each individual; and, 3) optimize benefits that can be derived from existing strengths and resources of the individual and his/her family and/or natural support network in the community. Co-Occurring Disorders (COD) Services include int egrated assessment and treatment for individuals who have co -occurring mental health and substance use condition. Crisis Assessment and Intervention includes services offered twenty -four (24) hours per day, seven days per week for individuals when they are experiencing an event that requires immediate response from a team member or other mental health professional. This includes a presence at local emergency departments and state crisis response settings (e.g. CAPES, CAPAC). Daily Staff Assignment Schedule is a written, daily timetable summarizing all individual treatment and service contacts to be divided and shared by staff working on that day. The daily staff assignment schedule will be developed from a central file of all weekly individual schedules. DHSS refers to the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services. DMMA refers to the Delaware Division of Medicaid and Medical Assistance, providing health care coverage to individuals with low incomes and to those with disabilities, ensuring access to high quality, cost effective and appropriate medical care and supportive services. DSAMH refers to the Delaware Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health within the Department of Health and Social Services. Family and Natural Supports' Psycho -education and Support is an approach to working in partnership with families and natural supports to provide current information about mental illness and to help them develop coping skills for handling problems posed by mental illness as experienced by a significant other in their lives. Health Homes were established within the Affordable Care Act to coordinate care for people with Medicaid who have chronic conditions, operating under a \"whole -person\" philosophy, integrating PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 142 and coordinating all primary, acute, behavioral health, and long -term services and supports to treat the whole person. ICM (Intensive Care Management) Team is a group of ten (10) ICM staff members who together have a range of clinical and rehabilitation skills and expertise. The ICM team members are assigned by the team leader and the psychiatric prescriber to work collaboratively with an individual and his/her family and/or natural supports in the community by the ti me of the first individual assessment and subsequent person directed recovery planning meeting. The ICM team serves up to 200 individuals and thus has a maximum staff to client ration of 1:20. The ICM team serves individuals referred from office -based out -patient care, requiring a higher level of support; as well as individuals referred from ACT services that are successful with increased independence. The core members of the team are the primary care manager, the psychiatric prescriber, and at least one clinical or rehabilitation staff person who shares case coordination and service provision tasks for each individual. The team has continuous responsibility to be knowledgeable about the individual's life, circumstances, goals and desires; to collabora te with the individual to develop and write the recovery plan; to offer options and choices in the recovery plan; to ensure that immediate changes are made as an individual's needs change; and to advocate for the individual's wishes, rights, and preference s. Frequency of contacts should be no less than every 14 days, 2.5 hours of contact per month. The ICM team is responsible for providing much of the individual's treatment, rehabilitation, and support services. Team members are assigned to take separate se rvice roles with the individual as specified by the individual and the person -directed recovery plan. Illness/Symptom Management is an approach directed to help each individual identify and target the undesirable symptoms and disruptive manifestations of his or her mental illness and develop methods to help reduce recurrence and impact of those symptoms. Methods include identifying triggers and warning signs associated with specific symptoms, and learning ways to prevent and cope with sym ptoms. Individual is an adult, age eighteen (18) and older who is receiving person -centered treatment, rehabilitation, and support services from the ICM team. Individual Therapy includes therapeutic interventions that help people make changes in their feelings, thoughts, and behavior in order to clarify goals and address stigma as they move toward recovery. Empirically -supported psychotherapy such as cognitive -behavioral therapy and supportive therapies also help individuals understand and identify sympto ms in order to find strategies to lessen distress and symptomatology, improve role functioning, and evaluate the personal effectiveness and appropriateness of treatment and rehabilitative services available to them. Informed Consent means that the consumer has an understanding of the purposes, risks and benefits of each medication or treatment prescribed, as well as his/her rights to refuse medication or treatment. Initial Assessment and Person directed recovery plan is the initial e valuation of: 1) the individual's mental and functional status; 2) the effectiveness of past treatment; 3) the current treatment, rehabilitation and support service needs, and 4) the range of individual strengths that can act as resources to the person and his/her team in pursuing goals. The results of the information gathering and analysis are used to establish the initial recovery plan to achieve individual goals and support recovery. Completed the day of admission, the individual's init ial assessment and recovery plan guides team services until the comprehensive assessment and full person directed recovery plan is completed. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 143 Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) include approaches to support individuals and build skills in a range of activities of daily living, including but not limited to finding housing, performing household activities, increased independence in carrying out personal hygiene and grooming tasks, money management, accessing and using transportatio n resources, and accessing services from a physician and dentist. Interdisciplinary Approach is the service model whereby team members from multiple disciplines analyze and synthesize shared roles and systematically collaborate and train each other in the methods associated with their expertise across assessment and service activities to reap the benefits of each member's unique point of view. The purpose of this approach is to share responsibility for services to consumers and to pool and integrate the expertise of team members so that consumers receive the specific evidence -based and client -centered services they need to achieve their goals. The communication expectation in this type of team involves continuous collaboration among all members (inclusiv e of the individual and, if desired, his/her family/other natural supports) on a regular, planned basis. Medication Administration is the physical act of giving medication to individuals in an ICM program by the prescribed route that is consistent with state law and the licenses of the professionals privileged to prescribe and/or administer medication (e.g., psychiatric prescribers, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and pharmacists). Medication Adherence Education involves the shar ing of information from the ICM team members to the individual or the individual's natural supports about pros and cons of taking medication for mental health conditions. Peers may not assist with medication adherence education. Medication Assistance is the oversight of medication adherence where a member of the ICM team observes or provides training in self -administration of medication With the exception of a registered nurse or psychiatric prescriber, all team members must receive Assistance With Self-Administered Medication (AWSAM) training at the beginning of employment and annually thereafter. Team members required to participate in AWSAM training may not observe medication assistance prior to completing initial AWSAM training during orientatio n and annual training thereafter. Peers may assist in medication assistance only when the team has determined that only the Peer will have the most success in helping the individual adhere to a prescribed medication regimen; this allowance must be time lim ited along with a plan to disengage the peer from providing this service in addition to pre-approval by DSAMH. Medication Error is any error in prescribing, administering or delivering a specific medication, including errors in writing or transcribing the prescription, in obtaining and administering the correct medication, in the correct dosage, in the correct form, and at the correct time. Medication Management is a collaborative effort between the individual and the psychiatric prescriber with the participation of the team to provide training in medication adherence and to carefully evaluate the individual's previous experience with psychotropic medications and side - effects; to identify and discuss the benefits and risks of psychotropic and other m edication; to choose a medication treatment; and to establish a method to prescribe and evaluate medication response according to EBP standards. Nurse Licensure Compact is a nurse who is licensed in one of the participating Compact (Multi - State) Licensur e states. A compact license allows a licensed Registered Nurse (RN) or Licensed PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 144 Practical Nurse (LPN) to work in another state without having to obtain licensure in that state. The state where the nurse is licensed and the state where the nurse works both must be parties to the compact agreement. Peer Support and Wellness Recovery Services are services provided by team members who have experience as recipients of mental health servi ces. The role of the peer support includes providing services that serve to validate individuals' experiences, provide guidance and encouragement to individuals to take responsibility for and actively participate in their own recovery, and help individuals identify, understand, and combat stigma and discrimination against mental illness and develop strategies to reduce individuals' self -imposed stigma. The DSAMH Scope of Practice for peers shall be the guide for utilizing this resource. Person -Directed Recovery plan (PDRP) is the product of a continuing process involving each individual, his/her family and/or natural supports in the community, and the ICM team, which tailors service activity and intensity to meet the individual's specific treatment, rehabilitation, and support needs. The written recovery plan documents the individual's strengths, resources, self -determined goals, and the services necessary to help the individual achieve them. The plan also delineates the roles and responsi bilities of the team members who work collaboratively with each individual in carrying out the services. Primary care manager under the supervision of the Team Leader, the primary care manager leads and coordinates the activities of the individual treatme nt team (and is the team member who has primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining a therapeutic relationship with an individual on a continuing basis, whether the individual is in the hospital, in the community, or involved with other agencie s. In addition, he or she is the responsible team member to be knowledgeable about the individual's life, circumstances, and goals and desires. The primary care manager develops and collaborates with the individual to write the person directed recovery pl an, offers options and choices in the recovery plan, ensures that immediate changes are made as the individual's needs change, and advocates for the individual's wishes, rights, and preferences. The primary care manager also works with other community reso urces, including individual -run services, to coordinate activities and integrate other agency or service activities into the overall Recovery Plan with the individual. The primary care manager provides individual supportive therapy and provides primary sup port and education to the family and/or support system and other significant people. In most cases the primary practitioner is the first team member available to the individual in crisis. The primary care manager shares these service activities with other members of the team who are responsible to perform them when the primary care manager is not working. Program refers to the ICM services team that provides service in accordance with these standards. Psychiatric Prescriber means a physician or psyc hiatric nurse practitioner, licensed by the State of Delaware who has specific clinical experience in the treatment of mental health disorders. Psychiatric Prescribers must have specific training in pharmacology and in applicability of psychotropic medications used with individuals who have a mental health diagnosis and have full privileges to diagnosis mental health disorders and prescribe psychotropic medications by virtue of their professional license. Psychotropic Medication is any drug used to treat, manage, or control psychiatric symptoms or behavior, including but not limited to antipsychotic, antidepressant, mood -stabilizing or anti -anxiety agents. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 145 Recovery Plan Review is a thorough, written summary describing the individual's and the interdisciplinary team's evaluation of the individual's progress/goal attainment, the effectiveness of the interventions, and satisfaction with services since the last person directed recovery plan. The Recovery Plan Review provides a basis for making needed refinements in the individual's Recovery Plan and includes active participation by the individual served. Recovery Planning Meeting is a regularly scheduled meeting conducted under the supervision of the team leader and the psychiatric prescriber. The purpose of the meeting is for the staff, and the individual and his/her family/natural supports (all working as a team) to thoroughly prepare for their work together. The group meets together to present a nd integrate the information collected through assessment to learn as much as possible about the individual's life, his/her experience with mental illness, and the type and effectiveness of the past treatment they have received. The presentations and discu ssions at these meetings make it possible for all staff to be familiar with each individual and his/her goals and aspirations and for each individual to become familiar with each team member; to participate in the ongoing assessment and reformulation of st rengths, resources, and service needs/issues; to problem -solve treatment strategies and rehabilitation options; and to fully understand the recovery plan rationale in order to carry out the plan for each goal. Service Coordination is a process of organization and coordination within the interdisciplinary team to carry out the range of treatment, rehabilitation, and support services each individual expects to receive in accordance with his or her written person directed recovery plan and that are respectful of the individual's wishes. Service coordination also includes coordination with community resources, including individual self -help and advocacy organizations that promote recovery. Serious and Persistent Mental Illness (SPMI) is an adult with a serious and persistent mental illness, \"1\" below must be met, in addition to either \"2\", \"3\", or \"4\": 1. Designated Mental Illness The individual is 18 years of age or older and currently meets the criteria for a DSM -5 psychiatric diagnosis other than alco hol or drug disorders, organic brain syndromes, developmental disabilities or social conditions. ICD -Coding Manual psychiatric categories and codes that do not have an equivalent in DSM -5 are also included mental illness diagnoses. AND 2. SSI or SSDI due to Mental Illness The individual is currently enrolled in SSI/SSDI due to a designated mental illness. OR 3. Extended Impairment in Functioning due to Mental Illness a. Documentation that the individual has experienced two of the following four functional limitations due to a designated mental illness over the past 12 months on a continuous or intermittent basis: i. Marked difficulties in self -care (personal hygiene, diet, clothing, avoiding injuries, securing health care or complying with medical advice). ii. Marked restriction of activities of daily living (maintaining a residence, using transportation, day to day money management, accessing community services). iii. Marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning (establishing and maintaining social relation ships, interpersonal interactions with primary partner, children or other family PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 146 members, friends, neighbors, social skills, compliance with social norms, appropriate use of leisure time). iv. Frequent deficiencies of concentration, persistence or pace resulting in failure to complete tasks in a timely manner (ability to complete tasks commonly found in work settings or in structured activities that take place in home or school settings, individuals may exhibit limitations in these areas when they repeatedly are unable to complete simple tasks within an established time period, make frequent errors in tasks, or require assistance in the completion of tasks). OR 4. Reliance on Psychiatric Treatment, Rehabilitation and Supports A documented history shows that the individual at some prior time met the threshold for 3 (above), but the symptoms and/or functioning problems are currently attenuated by medication or psychiatric rehabilitation and supports. Medication refers to psychotropic medications which may control certain primary manifestations of mental disorder; e.g. hallucinations, but may or may not affect functional limitations imposed by the mental disorder. Psychiatric rehabilitation and supports refer to highly structured and supportive settings which may greatly reduce the demands placed on the individual and thereby, minimize overt symptoms and signs of the underlying mental disorder. Social and Community Integration Skills Training provides s upport to individuals in managing social and interpersonal relationships and leisure time activities, with an emphasis on skills acquisition and generalization in integrated community -based settings. Supported Education provides the opportunities, resourc es, and supports to individuals with mental illness so that they may gain admission to and succeed in the pursuit of education including completing high school, (or obtaining a GED), post-secondary education and vocational school. Supported Employment is a service providing ongoing individualized support to learn a new job or maintain a job in competitive or customized integrated work setting that meets job and career goals, including self -employment, and are compensated at or above the minimum wage, in line with compensation to employees with the same or similar work by individuals without disabilities. Trauma -Informed organizations, programs, and services are based on an understanding of the vulnerabilities of triggers of trauma survivors that traditional services delivery approaches may exacerbate, so that these services and programs can be more supportive and avoid re - traumatization. Trauma -informed organizations take the steps necessary to make certain that, every part of its organization, management, and service delivery system is assessed and potentially modified to include a basic understanding of how trauma affects the life of an individual seeking services. Vocational Services include work -related services to help individuals value, find, and maintain meaningful employment in community -based settings. Weekly Individual Contact Schedule is a written schedule of the specific interventions or service contacts (i.e., by whom, when, for what duration, and where) that the ICM Team uses to help guide the goals and objectives in an individual's person directed recovery plan. The team shall maintain an up -to-date weekly individual contact schedule for each individual in accordance with the person directed recovery plan. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 147 Wellness Management and Recovery Services are a combination of psychosocial approaches to working in partnership with the individual to build and apply skills related to his or her recovery, including development of recovery strategies, buil ding social support, reducing relapses, using medication effectively, coping with stress, coping with problems and symptoms, attending to physical needs and getting needs met within the mental health system, medical system and community. 3 Admission and Discharge Criteria 3.1 Admission Criteria Eligible recipients are certified by the psychiatric prescriber as being in medical need of program services in accordance with an assessment procedure approved by the Division for use in determining that individuals are diagnosed with mental health conditions according to criteria for severity of disability associated with mental illness.

PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 186 Appendix 3: Certification Detail for Supported Employment Evidence -Based Practice (EBP) Certification Admission Criteria Individuals who are eligible for Supported Employment, are beneficiaries eligible for PROMISE, and who have indicated that employment -related goals are important to their recovery from mental illness. Beneficiaries in the PROMISE program are not required to achieve an additional level of symptom relief or functioning improvement in order to be eligible for Supported Employment services. The only eligibility criteria are those defined above. Supported Employment Service Definitions Within the PROMISE program, Supported Employment services are provided through two distinct services: 1. Individual Employment Support Services (IESS). 2. Short Term Small Group Supported Employment (STSGSE). Both have multiple types of service activities that constitute the service. See the referenced service definitions for Supported Employment activities that are eligible for reimbursement. Recommended Authorizations for IESS Intensive IESS (IIESS) . Authorization is for one (1) year, with a recommended six (6) -month review by the PROMISE Care Manager. After two (2) years of service, the provide r must supply a rationale as to why the person cannot receive Extended Follow Along (EFA) (see below), and the PROMISE Care Manager must concur. EFA. Authorization is for one (1) year, with a recommended six (6)-month review by the PROMISE Care Manager. Fidelity to the Supported Employment Model The Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model of Supported Employment is the vocational program for people with serious mental illnesses (SMIs) that has the best evidence base. A set of scales for measuring and rating programs in relationship to the evidence -based model has been developed and these scales are provided below. Programs should, at a minimum, adhere to the following critical ingredients of the IPS model: Conduct rapid job searches with beneficiaries (as \"readiness\" programs are not found to be helpful). Help beneficiaries obtain competitive, integrated jobs (versus \"set -aside\" employment for people with disabilities). Provide job coaching and intensive ongoing support to people at every stage of job placement. Individualize services, based on the beneficiary's vocational goals and preferences, as well as on his or her relative strengths and limitations in finding, obtaining, and maintaining employment. Actively develop jobs by establishing collaborative relationships with a wide variety of potential employers. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 187 Ensure integration of Supported Employment services with clinical services, through the Employment Specialist's active participation and collaboration with each beneficiary's clinical team. The fidelity scales following this section constitute an important approach to assessing Supported Employment programs and services. STSGSE There is no specific fidelity tool available for this service. However, the PROMISE Home and Community -based Services Service Manual (Service Manual) describes core elements of this model, and the State should use its Quality Assurance function to assess the extent to which programs are following the core elements that are outline d in the Service Manual. Supported Employment Staffing and Qualifications Staffing and Qualifications for IESS The IPS model dictates that a small group of between two (2) and 10 Employment Specialists work with caseloads of 20 beneficiaries each. Caseloads will include a mix of beneficiaries who have been authorized for IIESS and EFA. Employment Specialists are supervised by a Team Leader, who also serves as an Employment Specialist, but for a smaller numbe r of beneficiaries (approximately eight (8) at any one time). Employment Specialists serving on Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) teams also should follow the core fidelity elements of the IPS model. For the PROMISE program, we recommend the following typical staffing for IPS Supported Employment teams, allowing for variation within the bounds of currently recognized fidelity (two (2) to 10 Employment Specialists): Staff FTE Caseload Total Served Team Lead 1 8 8 Employment Specialists 5 20 100 Total 6 N/A 108 Employment Specialist Qualifications Experts agree that the amount of past vocational training is less important than being willing to embrace the IPS model. Employment Specialists with much past training in opposing models can sometimes actually be less effective than those with less general vocational training who receive IPS training for their work as Employment Specialists. An Employment Specialist should have a bachelor's degree, meet the regulatory requirements for Associate Clinicians, and once employed, should complete the requisite training in the IPS model of Supported Employment described below. They should also have had a minimum of one (1) year experience living or working with an individual with a disability or related support needs, similar to those of the beneficiaries served in the waiver (or related educational experience). However, note that the Tool for the Measurement of Assertive Community Treatment (TMACT), the latest and best approach to assessing t he fidelity of ACT teams, does recommend that Employment Specialists either have a degree in the vocational rehabilitation field or one (1) year of full-time PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 188 experience providing employment services to people with SMIs. The more stringent requirements from TMACT are important in the ACT team context because Employment Specialists on ACT teams must often function independently (i.e., without the benefit of having an IPS/Supported Employment -specific Team Leader). Team Leader Quali fications Supported Employment Team Leaders should either be Associate Clinicians who have bachelor's degrees and at least five (5) years of experience working as an Employment Specialist, or they should be Qualified State Plan Providers who hold at least a master's degree and who have at least one (1) year experience working as an Employment Specialist. Required Training for PROMISE Providers All providers of both IESS and STSGSE should receive training in the IPS model of Supported Employment from a recognized expert in the model.1 For providers who have not yet received training in the model, training should include a two (2) -day event during which trainees are presented with each key aspect of the IPS model (thereby covering all fidelity items). A ll providers of this EBP should receive at least one day of continuing education/training in the IPS model each year thereafter. Clinical/Program Leads from provider agencies also should participate in the training, if they have not already received IPS training. In addition to participating in the two (2) -day IPS model training, Team Leaders should receive a one (1) -day training on the role of the Team Leader in the IPS model. In subsequent years, they should also receive at least one (1) d ay of continuing education/training in the model, along with Employment Specialists. Next Steps \u2014 Including Development of an EBP Certification Model For program certification: Identify required fidelity levels for the IPS model, overall, as well as for what are considered critical fidelity elements of IPS. Specify the reimbursement implications of meeting or not meeting those requirements. 1STSGSE providers should also receive training due to the fact that the PROMISE Program is going to rely on them to appropriately prepare people for and transfer them to the more recovery -oriented IESS services. STSGESE providers need to appropriate as many of the core elements of the IPS model as they can in the STSGSE context.

Certification is required for provider enrollment with the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS), Division of Medicaid and Medical Assistance (DMMA) Program for Medicaid reimbursement through the rehabilitative services option of Title XIX of the Social Secu rity Amendments. Through an Inter -Divisional Agreement, DSAMH has been delegated authority for administration of certain provisions of the Medicaid program pertaining to Behavioral Health services covered under the Rehabilitative services option. These provisions include the following: 1) certification of programs for provider enrollment, 2) rate setting, and 3) performance improvement. Delegated performance improvement functions include program monitoring, utilization control, training, and techni cal assistance. DMMA requires providers of Behavioral Health Rehabilitative services to be certified by DSAMH as a condition of enrollment before they may provide services to eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. Behavioral Health Rehabilitative services are medically related Treatment, Rehabilitative, and Support services for beneficiaries with disabilities caused by mental illness and substance use disorders (SUDs). CRISP is a category of community support programs that DSAMH certifies as one of the criteria for Medicaid provider enrollment. Services are provided for as long as is medically necessary to assist service beneficiaries to manage the symptoms of their behavioral health disorder, minimize the effects of their disability on their capaci ty for independent living and prevent or eliminate periods of inpatient treatment, and minimize the need for using Emergency services. Introduction to CRISP Based upon a successful Baltimore, Maryland program from the 1990s, CRISP is a program that directly implements aspects of the Department of Justice Settlement Agreement. Using a Case Rate financing model, CRISP contractors are required to directly provide or arrange for all services needed by the enrolled beneficiary. These services are fully re covery -oriented and based on the unique and individualized needs of each beneficiary enrolled. In addition, the Case Rate contract and funding supports Supplemental services, such that the provider will have flexibility to implement a specialized plan for each beneficiary to meet their individual needs over time. The CRISP model is designed to achieve an outcome -oriented, effective, community -based system of care for adults with serious mental illness (SMI). Under CRISP, providers will have significant authority and flexibility for designing beneficiary services. The CRISP model is based on a risk -based capitated model that put the rewards and risks to outcomes solely on the CRISP team. As such, the funding for the team must be completely separate from the finances of other parts of the provider's organization. The financial risks of the model are to be borne by the team, and the incentives earned are to accrue to the team for team use only. As such, it is also expected that the management of the team and the clinical and financial decisions of the team be the responsibility of the team itself, separate and distinct from other parts of the provider's organization. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 205 At its inception, there were approximately 100 individuals residing at the Delaware Psychiatric Center (DPC) and identified by DSAMH as requiring a non -institutional level of care. Additionally, these individuals wanted to transition out of the DPC. To support this transition to the community, they wer e enrolled in CRISP. With the implementation of the DSAMH Promoting Optimal Mental Health for Individuals Through Supports and Empowerment (PROMISE) program on January 1, 2015, these individuals have been determined to meet the PROMISE eligibility criteria . These individuals will be enrolled in the PROMISE program and will receive all services necessary for community living from the PROMISE program through CRISP. CRISP providers are required to adhere to the standards established for the PROMISE program. Ad ditionally, in 2015, certified CRISP providers will be required to enroll as PROMISE program providers and employ/subcontract with practitioners or subcontractors who meet PROMISE practitioner requirements. Upon the initiation of CRISP, approximately half of the enrolled beneficiaries were eligible for Medicaid; the other half was uninsured. Up until the initiation of the PROMISE program, Medicaid did not provide any reimbursement for the Medicaid -eligible CRISP beneficiaries. Beginning on January 1, 2015, for those CRISP beneficiaries that are Medicaid -eligible, the CRISP program per member per month will no longer fund any services covered under the acute care managed care organization (MCO) benefit . Medicaid will reimburse CRISP providers for services delivered to Medicaid beneficiaries that are Medicaid -reimbursable. The PROMISE program will ensure that Medicaid payments are backed out of any State -only capitated payments made for the CRISP program, thus ensuring no duplicate payment between C RISP/PROMISE. Service components that are not provided to, or directed exclusively toward, the treatment of the Medicaid beneficiary are not eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. Certification for CRISP Provider Participation 1. Authority \u2014 Through an Inter -Divisional Agreement, DHSS, DMAP has delegated the function of certifying organizations for enrollment as providers of optional Behavioral Health Community Support services to DSAMH. 2. Certification Criteria \u2014 Eligibility for certification as a CRISP provider is determined according to the following criteria: 1.1. Organizations eligible to apply for provider certification and enrollment with DHSS for Medicaid reimbursement of Community Support services include: 1.1.1. Private non-profit human service corporations. 1.1.2. Private for-profit human service corporations. 1.2. DSAMH bases its certification of programs and enrollment recommendations to DHSS upon the organization's compliance with State -level organizational, administrative, and program standards that are consistent with federal Medicaid requirements related to Rehabilitative services. 1.3. DSAMH establishes and applies minimum compliance guidelines to be used in making certification determinations. 1.4. DSAMH uses a certification survey to measure compliance with or ganizational, administrative, and program standards. The determination with regard to a program's certification is based on: 1.4.1. Statements made and certified by authorized representatives of the organization. 1.4.2. Documents provided to DSAMH by the organization. 1.4.3. Documented compliance with organizational, program, and administrative standards. 1.4.4. On site observations by surveyor.

PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 221 Appendix 5: Promoting Optimal Mental Health for Individuals through Supports and Empowerment (PROMISE) Services Rate Development This section describes the methodology and assumptions used in developing the fee -for-service (FFS) rates for PROMISE services. The State contracted with Mercer Government Human Services Consulting (Mercer), part of Mercer Health & Benefits LLC, to establish fees for these services. Methodology The fee schedule metho dology consisted of a multi -pronged approach. The first step involved a check to determine if fee schedule rates existed in a current State Medicaid program for services that were comparable to the PROMISE services. If this was the case, then the existing Medicaid fee schedule rate for that comparable service was used. This held true for the following services: Nursing services (RN and LPN) \u2014 Fee schedule rates existed on the Division of Medicaid and Medical Assistance (DMMA) fee schedule for comparable Private Duty Nursing (PDN), Registered Nurse (RN), and Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) services. Peer Supports \u2014 Fee schedule rate existed for the comparable Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Peer service. Personal Care, Instrumental Activities of Dai ly Living (IADL)/Chore, and Respite In -home \u2014 Fee schedule rate existed for the comparable Personal Care service under the PATHWAYS program; final rate was converted to a 15-minute unit instead of hourly basis. Benefits Counseling, Financial Coaching, and Small -group Supported Employment \u2014 Fee schedule rates existed under the PATHWAYS program for the comparable Benefits Counseling, Financial Coaching, and Short Term Small Group Supported Employment (STSGSE) services, respectively. Non-medical Transportation (NMT) \u2014 See FFS fee schedule from Logisticare. Where State Medicaid fee schedule rates for comparable services were not already in existence, the fees were developed using a market -based pricing methodology. This approach was used for Psychosocial Rehabilitation (PSR), Community Psychiatric Support and Treatment (CPST), Individual Employment Support Services (IESS), Residential, and Care Management services. Under this approach, assumptions were established for key cost components based on the service description to calculate the modeled fee ranges. The key steps in the process are highlighted below: 1. Review the service definition and identify key cost components. 2. Gather Delaware wage data to inform salary assumptions. 3. Conduct additional research to inform key assumptions. 4. Work with the State to finalize cost component assumptions. Each of the steps is described in more detail in the subsequent paragraphs. Step 1 \u2014 Review the Service Definition and Identify Key Cost Components To develop the modeled fee ranges, the service definitions were reviewed for each service to understand the key requirements of the services, including provider qualifications, licensing PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 222 requirements, staffing requirements, and other general information related to delivery of each service. Based on this review, the key cost components were identified to account for costs that were reasonable, necessary, and related to the delivery of the service. The major cost components considered for each service were: Direct Care Costs \u2014 Salary expenses for the required staffing (i.e., the different positions and time requirements) at prevailing Delaware wages, adjusted to include consideration for Employee -Relate d Expenses (ERE) and productivity. Indirect Costs \u2014 Supervisory expenses and other program -related costs. Administrative costs. Step 2 \u2014 Gather Delaware Wage Data to Inform Salary Assumptions Based on the service definitions and State clinical practice reviews, appropriate staffing levels and positions for each service were determined. Compensation data was compiled from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for PSR, CPST, IESS, and Residential services. Since Care Management is currently provided by S tate employees, wages for this service were compiled from the State's Human Resources Management website. The data was representative of wages paid in the State of Delaware and was used to develop an annual wage range for each staffing position, as outline d below. PROMISE Service Staff Position Annual Salary Range Fiscal Year 2014/2015 PSR Direct Care Worker $35,000 $168,000 -$247,000 Residence Manager $48,000 -$66,000 Residential \u2014 Supervised Apartments Direct Care Worker $24,000 -$35,000 Residence Manager $48,000 -$66,000 Care Management Direct Care Worker $38,000 -$47,000 Supervisor $54,000 -$68,000 Step 3 \u2014 Conduct Additional Research to Inform Key Assumptions This section discusses the research findings and assumptions for ERE and program -related cost components. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 223 ERE In addition to wages, the following ERE components were considered for both the Direct Care and Indirect Care staff: Health Insurance (Medical, Dental, and Vision). Unemployment Taxes (Federal and State). Worker's Compensation. Federal Insurance Contribution Act Tax (FICA). Contributions for other benefits (e.g., Short -term Disability, Long -term Disability, Retirement). The amounts included in the fees represent the employer's share of the costs for these items. For PSR, CPST, and IESS, approximately 20% -30% of the total wage amount was built in for the ERE cost component. This assumption was bas ed on market data benchmarks. For Residential services, approximately 25% -35% of the total wage amount was built in for the ERE cost component. This was based on a review of market data, as well as historical residential provider invoices. Since Care Manag ement is currently provided by State employees, ERE expenses for this service were compiled from the State's Human Resources Management website. Approximately 50% -60% of the total wage amount was built into the Care Management fee for the ERE cost component. Other Program -related Costs In addition to ERE, other program -related costs were considered including costs for training, accreditation, staff travel, supplies, occupancy, and administrative expenses. Based on the nature of the services, consid erations differed for Residential services, so they are described separately in subsequent paragraphs. PSR, CPST, Care Management, and IESS Training Costs Consideration was made for expenses related to standard training requirements outlined in the service descriptions. This was done consistently for PSR, CPST, Care Management, and IESS. Since IESS providers must meet certain fidelity requirements set forth by the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model in order to render this service, additiona l costs were reflected in the IESS fees to account for the costs that would be incurred to obtain this accreditation. Staff Travel Consideration was included for staff travel expenses. The annual mileage for each service was estimated by taking an assumed number of miles traveled per day (based on discussions with the State) and multiplying by the total billable days worked each year. The resulting annual mileage was assumed to be paid at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) standard mileage rate. Service -related Supplies Consideration was included for the cost of service -related materials or equipment that the provider would be required to have in order to deliver the service. Occupancy Costs associated with general occupancy expenses, such as office space used for the delivery of the service, were also considered in the fees. An occupancy cost was included for all services that are rendered in an office setting and not directly provided in the community. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 224 Administration Costs asso ciated with general administrative expenses such as management, equipment and supplies, recruitment, information technology, human resources, billing, finance and accounting, legal, and other indirect costs necessary for program operations were also consid ered. The assumption was based on discussions with the State and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services expectations regarding acceptable levels for this cost component. Residential Services (Group Home and Supervised Apartments) Training, Staff Travel, and Supplies Consideration was made for expenses related to standard training requirements outlined in the service descriptions. The fees also included consideration for staff travel expenses and service -related materials or equipment that the provider would be required to have in order to deliver the service. Historical residential provider invoices were reviewed to understand the amount that providers historically spent on these items, and these values were compared to market benchmarks for reasonability. Note that expenditures related to Room and Board were not included in the fee development process. Administration Costs associated with general administrative expenses such as management, equipment and supplies, recruitment, information technology, human resources, billing, finance and accounting, legal, and other indirect costs necessary for program operations were also considered. The assumption was based on a review of historical residential provider invoices a nd discussions with the State. Step 4 \u2014 Work with the State to Finalize Key Cost Component Assumptions PSR, CPST, Care Management, and IESS Non-billable Time For PSR, CPST, Care Management, and IESS, adjustments to account for non -billable staff time were also considered. Non -billable staff time includes time for training, paid time off (PTO), and a portion of each workday that is spent on usual and required non -billable activities. Consideration for this non -billable time was included in the fee through a productivity adjustment. The staffing cost (i.e., cost for Direct Care and Indirect Care staff) was adjusted by a factor that accounted for the total billable time relative to the total staff time. Absentee Factor An absentee factor was used to include consideration for the percentage of time that appointments are missed. Although missed appointments reduce the units of service that are delivered, the provider still needs to pay their Direct Care staff for their hours on the job. Please note that an absentee factor was not included for Care Management services. Residential Services (Group Home and Supervised Apartments) Vacancy Factor To include consideration for days when the beneficiary is temporarily not in the residence (e.g., due to medical or therapeutic leave), a vacancy factor was included. This assumption was based on historical residential group home and supervised apartment vacancy rates and discussions with the State. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 225 Fee Schedule Summary Please see the service description section for the final fees selected by the State. Limitations and Caveats In preparing the fee ranges, Mercer considered publicly available market information, provider invoice data, and guidance from the State. We reviewed the data and information for internal consistency and reasonableness, but have not audited them. If the data or information is incomplete or inaccurate, the values may need to be revised accordingly. The following limitations apply to the development of the fee ranges: Fee schedule assumptions were based upon the PROMISE service descriptions that were approved effective December 19, 2014. When the service descriptions were not specific regarding a particular cost component, the applicable assumptions were developed in conjunction with the State. To the extent changes or clarifications are made to the service descriptions, fees may be impacted and need to be updated accordingly. Fee schedule assumptions were developed based upon information available as of December 2014. Fees developed by Mercer are projections of future contingent events. Actual provider costs may differ from these projections. Mercer has developed these fees on behalf of the State to support the delivery of PROMISE services. Use of these fees for any p urpose beyond that stated may not be appropriate. Potential PROMISE fee schedule service providers are advised that the use of these fees may not be appropriate for their particular circumstance, and Mercer disclaims any responsibility for the use of these fees by providers for any purpose. Mercer recommends that any organization considering contracting with the State should analyze its own projected expenses and revenue needs for comparison to the fees offered by the State before deciding whether to contract with the State. This methodology document assumes the reader is familiar with the PROMISE program and projection techniques. It is intended for the State and should not be relied upon by third parties. Other readers should seek advice of qualified professionals to understand the technical nature of these results. This document should only be reviewed in its entirety. Delaware Intensive Case Management (ICM) and Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Billing Guidance and Rate Development ICM Billing Guidance ICM 15 -minute units may only be billed when the ICM practitioner has performed a medically necessary face -to-face service with the beneficiary or a family member for that time. Small ICM teams serve, on average, 100 or fewer beneficiari es. Large ICM teams serve, on average, 101 -200 benefciaries. ICM practitioners may only bill for a 15 -minute unit if at least eight (8) minutes of service is provided. Group ICM contacts are not reimbursable. Practitioners may not bill for services included in the 15 -minute units and also bill for that service outside of the 15-minute rate for consumers enrolled in ICM.

Services provided before the department or its designee (including the prepaid inpatient health plan) has approved authorization. Services rendered that are not in accordance with an approved authorization. Services not identified on the beneficiary's (adult's) authorized ICM participant -directed Recovery Plan or PROMISE Recovery Plan. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 227 Services provided without prior authorization by the department or its designee. Services not in compliance with the contract or the ICM provider certification service manual. Services provided to children, spouse, parents, or siblings of the eligible beneficiary under treatment or others in the eligible beneficiary's life to address problems not directly related to the eligible beneficiary 's issues and not listed on the eligible beneficiary's ICM participant -directed Recovery Plan or PROMISE Recovery Plan.. Services provided that are not within the provider's scope of practice. Any art, movement, dance, or drama therapies. Anything not included in the approved ICM service description. Changes made to ICM that do not follow the requirements outlined in the provider contract and provider certification service manual. Any intervention or contact not documented or consistent with the approved treatment/recovery plan goals, objectives, and approved services will not be reimbursed. Employment of the beneficiary. Under the PROMISE HCBS program, ICM includes non -job specific vocational training, employment assessments, and ongoing support to maintain employment. ACT may also pay for the Medical services that enable the beneficiary to function in the workplace, including ACT services such as a psychiatrist's or psychologist's treatment, rehabilitation planning, therapy, and counseling that e nable the beneficiary to function in the workplace. Note: if Supported Employment is separately listed on the beneficiary's Recovery Plan as a covered PROMISE service, qualified bachelor's level practitioners enrolled as Employment Specialists under PROMIS E may bill for one bachelor's level per diem rate per month of Supported Employment after the Vocational Rehabilitation Job Placement services (typically 90-days after placement) are exhausted. ACT Billing Guidance ACT per diems may only be billed on days when the ACT team has performed a face -to-face service with the beneficiary or a family member. Only one per diem per category of practitioner type on each team may be billed per beneficiary per day. All other contacts, meetings, travel time, etc., are considered indirect costs and are accounted for in the build -up of the per diem rate. Small ACT teams serve, on average, 70 or fewer beneficiaries. Large ACT teams serve, on average, 71 -100 beneficiaries but no more than 125. For an ACT team per diem to be generated, a 15 -minute or longer face -to-face contact that meets all requirements outlined below must occur. A 15 -minute contact is defined as lasting at least eight (8) minutes. Group contacts alone are not permitted as a face -to-face contact for gene rating an ACT per diem rate. ACT practitioners using a 15-minute unit rate, may only bill for a 15-minute unit if at least eight (8) minutes of service is provided. Group ACT contacts are not reimbursable. Practitioners may not bill for services included in the ACT per diem or 15 -minute units and also bill for that service outside of the per diem/15 -minute rate for enrolled beneficiaries. All services require prior authorizations. The Psychiatric prescriber shall be physically located at the home clinic of the ACT team in order to provide office -based services and services in the community when indicated. With the prior approval of the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health (DSAMH), Psychiatric prescribers may be accessed via videoconferencing/tele -psychiatry consistent with PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 228 State tele -medicine requirements for a period of up to six (6) months. At DSAMH's discretion, DSAMH may extend this authorization for an additional six (6) months.11 Non-Fidelity ACT Rate Level A team that does not have an ACT provisional, basic, moderately -high, or high level fidelity rating (see definitions below) can only bill at the non-fidelity ACT rate. Provisional Fidelity Level A new ACT team can be certified at a provisional fidelity level for six (6) months if it has submitted the required documentation to the DSAMH Quality Assurance Unit. At that time, the ACT team must undergo a mock fidelity review by DSAMH and achieve an average Tool s for Measurement of Assertive Community Treatment (TMACT) fidelity score of 2.0 or greater. In order to achieve a provisional fidelity level, the team must also achieve minimum fidelity rating scores on certain aspects of TMACT fidelity: A minimum average rating of 3.0 across the following items from the operations and structure (OS) subscale must be achieved: \u2014 OS1 \u2014 Low ratio of beneficiaries to staff. \u2014 OS5 \u2014 Program size. \u2014 OS6 \u2014 Priority service population. \u2014 OS10 \u2014 Retention rate. A minimum average rating of 3.0 on the entire core team (CT) subscale must be received. A minimum rating of 3.0 on core practices (CP) subscale CP1 \u2014 community -based services item must be received. A team meeting provisional fidelity will be able to be reimbursed at the basic fidelity level for up to one (1) year from the date of its initial provisional fidelity level certification. During the year following the provisional fidelity level certification, the team must comply with DSAMH requirements to carry out a full fide lity assessment and achieve a fidelity rating of at least basic level fidelity. After 12 months from the provisional fidelity level certification date, if the team has failed to meet at least basic level fidelity, it will revert to the non -fidelity ACT bil ling rate. At any time during the 12 -month period of provisional fidelity level certification, DSAMH can request additional information to assess any questions that may arise regarding any TMACT fidelity metric. At the time of request, all subsequent billing will be pended subject to verification of the identified TMACT fidelity metric. If the additional review reveals that the fidelity score for any identified metric falls below a 1.0, the team will have 90 days to demonstrate capacity at a level above 1.0 for each identified metric. If such capacity is not demonstrated to the satisfaction of DSAMH, billing will revert to the non-fidelity ACT 11 Consultations, office visits, individual psychotherapy, and pharmacological management services under ACT prescriber - as outlined above for the time granted by the waiver only -may be reimbursed when provided via Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act compliant telecommunication technology. The consulting or expert physician must bill the ACT procedu re code (CPT codes) using the GT modifier and will be reimbursed at the same rate as a face -to-face service for ACT physician. The originating site, with the consumer present, may bill code Q3014 (telemedicine originating site facility fee). Providers must follow all applicable federal and State security and procedure guidelines for telemedicine. Face -to-face ACT includes a therapist in a different room/location from the client/family, but in the same building, with real - time visual and audio transmission from the therapy room and two -way audio transmission between client and/or family member and therapist. The practice must be in accord with documented evidence -based practices of ACT as approved by DSAMH. If not in the same building, then telemedicine requ irements and reimbursement would apply. Telemedicine services must comply with Delaware's telemedicine requirements including, but not limited to: Obtaining member's written consent; Licensure and enrollment requirements; Written contingency planning; Implementation of confidentiality protocols; and Billing practices and requirements. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 229 level for all pended and future services until at least basic fidelity level is achieved on those identified metrics. Once the year of provisiona l fidelity is completed, DSAMH may place any ACT team not reaching basic fidelity on a corrective action plan, not to exceed 90 days. During that time, the team may bill ACT rates. If the team is not at basic fidelity at that time, the team must bill non -fidelity ACT rates until basic fidelity is achieved. Basic Fidelity Level ACT teams scoring an overall TMACT fidelity score of at least 3.0 may bill for up to four (4) per diems per month per beneficiary when all other requirements for a visit are met (i.e., a face -to-face service with the beneficiary or family member). Medically necessary care consistent with the fidelity model should be delivered even if beyond the minimum number of units permitted to be billed under this reimbursement strategy. The t eam must also achieve the following minimum fidelity rating scores on certain aspects of TMACT fidelity: A minimum average rate of 3.0 across the following items from the OS subscale must be achieved: \u2014 OS1 \u2014 Low ratio of beneficiaries to staff. \u2014 OS5 \u2014 Progr am size. \u2014 OS6 \u2014 Priority service population. \u2014 OS10 \u2014 Retention rate. A minimum average rating of 3.0 on the CT subscale must be received. A minimum rating of 3.0 on CP subscale CP1 \u2014 community -based services item must be received. At any time during the 12-month period of basic fidelity level certification, DSAMH can request additional information to assess any questions that may arise regarding any TMACT fidelity metric. At the time of request, all subsequent billing will be pended subject to verificatio n of the identified TMACT fidelity metric. If the additional review reveals that the fidelity score for any identified metric falls below the standards for OS, CT, and CP1 listed above, the team will have 90 days to demonstrate capacity at a level above the required minimums for each identified metric. If such capacity is not demonstrated to the satisfaction of DSAMH, billing will revert to the non -fidelity ACT level for all pended and future services until at least basic fidelity level is achieved on those identified metrics. Practitioners on the ACT teams are subject to the following billing limits per category per month per beneficiary, not to exceed a total of four (4) per diems (as defined above) per beneficiary in total from any combination of practitioners (Note: the billing must be based on actual services provided to the beneficiary and medically necessary care consistent with the fidelity model should be delivered even if beyond the minimum number of units permitted to be bill ed under this reimbursement strategy. ): \u2014 Category 1: Physicians and APRNs may not bill more than one (1) per diem for a beneficiary per month in total. \u2014 Category 2: Any combination of Psychologist, master's level, Team Leader, LCSW, LPC, LMFT, LAC, behavior al health other, RN, and LPN may not bill more than one (1) per diem for a beneficiary in a monthly total. Ideally, this visit will not be in a clinic setting. \u2014 Category 3: All other practitioners on the ACT teams may bill up to two (2) per diems for a beneficiary in a monthly total. Ideally, these visits will not be in a clinic setting. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 230 Note: Only one practitioner across all categories may bill on the same day (e.g., only one per diem can be billed on a given day). IESS provided by an ACT team requires prior authorization and is billed only when Supported Employment goals and activities are specifically outlined on the beneficiary's Recovery Plan. The team may bill up to one extra bachelor's level unit (i.e., 5th per diem) for the team Voc ational Specialist per month when vocational activities were conducted with the team consistent with the TMACT fidelity model. Documentation must be maintained regarding the vocational activities performed and the goals/activities completed for each indivi dual in the beneficiary's medical record. Moderately High Fidelity Level ACT teams scoring an overall TMACT fidelity score of at least 3.5 when all other requirements are met (i.e., a face -to-face service with the beneficiary or family member) are considered moderately high fidelity. In addition to the average score, teams must meet the following specific TMACT requirements: A minimum average rate of 3.5 across the following items from the OS subscale must be achieved: \u2014 OS5 \u2014 Program size. \u2014 OS6 \u2014 Priority service population (which must be at least 4). \u2014 OS9 \u2014 Transition to less Intensive services. \u2014 OS10 \u2014 Retention rate. A minimum average rating of 4 on the CT subscale must be received. A minimum rating of 4 on CP subscale CP1 \u2014 community -based services item must be received. A minimum average rating of 3 on the person -based planning (PP) subscale must be received. At any time during the 12-month period of moderately high fidelity level certification, DSAMH can request additional information to assess any questions that may arise regarding any TMACT fidelity metric. At the time of request, all subsequent billing will be pended subject to verification of the identified TMACT fidelity metric. If the additional review revea ls that the fidelity score for any identified metric falls below the standards for OS, CT, CP1, and PP listed above, the team will have 90 days to demonstrate capacity at a level above the required minimums for each identified metric. If a team meets moder ately high fidelity, DSAMH may consider permitting additional per diems via prior authorization as necessary to meet moderately high fidelity standards. However, if such capacity is not demonstrated to the satisfaction of DSAMH, billing will revert to the basic level for all pended and future services until at least moderately high fidelity level is achieved on those identified metrics. High Fidelity Level ACT teams scoring a TMACT fidelity score of at least 4.2 when all other requirements are met (i.e., a face -to-face service with the beneficiary or family member) is considered high fidelity. In addition, teams must meet the following specific TMACT requirements (similar to Level 2 teams): A minimum average rate of 4 across the following items fro m the OS subscale must be achieved: \u2014 OS5 \u2014 Program size. \u2014 OS6 \u2014 Priority service population (this item must score a 5). \u2014 OS9 \u2014 Transition to less Intensive services. \u2014 OS10 \u2014 Retention rate. A minimum average rating of 4 on the CT subscale must be received. A minimum rating of 4 on CP1 - community -based services item must be received. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 231 A minimum average rating of 3.7 on the following subscales: \u2014 PP subscale. \u2014 Specialist team subscale. \u2014 Evidence -based Practice (EBP) subscale. At any time during the 12 -month period of high fidelity level certification, DSAMH can request additional information to assess any questions that may arise regarding any TMACT fidelity metric. At the time of request, all subsequent billing will be pended subject to verification of the identified TMACT fidelity metric. If the additional review reveals that the fidelity score for any identified metric falls below the standards for OS, CT, CP1, PP, specialist, and EBPs listed above, the team will have 90 days to demonstrate capacity at a level above the required minimums for each identified metric. If a team meets high fidelity, DSAMH may consider permitting additional per diems via prior authorization as necessary to meet high fidelity standards. However, if such capacity is not demonstrated to the satisfaction of DSAMH, billing will revert to the Basic level for all pended and future services until at least moderately high or high fidelity level is achieved on those identified metrics.

ACT may also pay for the medical services that enable the beneficiary to function in the workplace, including ACT services such as a psychiatrist's or psychologist's treatment, rehabilitation planning, therapy, and counselin g that enable the beneficiary to function in the workplace. Note: if Supported Employment is separately listed on the individuals Recovery Plan as a covered PROMISE service, qualified bachelor's level practitioners enrolled as Employment Specialists under PROMISE may bill for one (1) bachelor's level per diem rate per month of Supported Employment after the Vocational Rehabilitation Job Placement services (typically 90 - days after placement) are exhausted. ACT Rate Development This document describes the methodology and assumptions used in developing the rates for ACT. The proposed rates establish separate rates for practitioners with similar licensure/educational requirements. The State contracted with Mercer to establish rates for these ser vices. Methodology Rates were developed using a market -based pricing methodology for each service. Under this approach, assumptions were established for key cost components based on the service description to calculate the modeled rate. The key steps in the process are highlighted below: 1. Review the service definitions and identify key cost components. 2. Evaluate budget data submitted by ACT providers. 3. Conduct additional research to inform key assumptions. 4. Work with the State to finalize key pricing assumptions. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 234 Step 1 \u2014 Review the Service Definitions and Identify Key Cost Components To develop the modeled rates, we first established an understanding of the staffing requirements for each service. From the service definition and a review of clinical practices, we determined the appropriate staff positions: Team Lead \u2014 Licensed Mental Health Professional, master's degree. Therapists \u2014 bachelor's or master's level staff. Peer/High School Level \u2014 High school level degree or GRE. Docto r/Psychiatrist \u2014 Licensed Board Certified Psychiatrist. APRN \u2014 Licensed Nurse Practitioner. Nurse \u2014 Licensed RN. The average numbers of full -time employees (FTEs) for each level of staff reflected in the ACT rates are below in Table 1. Note that separate staffing levels were used for large and small team rates. Small ACT teams may serve no more than 70 beneficiaries. Large ACT teams may serve no more than 100 beneficiaries. Table 1: Staffing Summary12 Staff Small Team Large Team Team Lead 1 FTE 1 FTE Masters Therapist 2 FTEs 2 FTEs FTEs (one FTE must be a bachelor's) NOTE: Providers may choose to have three (3) RN FTE's and two (2) Bachelors FTE's with one (1) of the RN's having a Bachelor's Degree or two (2) RN FTE's and three (3) Bachelors FTEs (one (1) could also be a RN). Cost Components The modeled rates considered the following key cost components: Salary expenses for the required staffing (i.e., the different positions and time requirements) at prevailing Delaware wages, adjusted to include consideration for ERE and productivity. Indirect non-salary, program -related costs. Administrative costs. Step 2 \u2014 Gather Wage Data for Delaware To estimate the cost of the staffing requirements identified above, Mercer gathered compensation data from proposed budgets for ACT providers. The data should be representative of wages paid in Delaware and was used to develop a wage for each staffing position. 12 TMACT also assumes a Program Assistant working with the ACT team. It is covered under administrative expenses below though not explicitly since it is grouped together with all other administrative costs. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 235 However, in the case of the Nurse Practitioner position, we did not receive compensation data from the proposed budgets, and thus used a wage study from the American Academy of Nurses. We proposed using the average base salary for a Nurse Practitioner in the Psychiatric/Mental Health field. However, since this was a national average, Mercer applied a regional analysis factor to adjust this wage upward. Mercer performed reasonability checks of the wages by comparing these to compensation studies of similar positions in nearby states. Also, trend was considered to adjust the wage to the current time period. The wage assumptions for the different levels of staff are summar ized in Table 2. Table 2: Hourly Wage Summary Staff Wage Team Lead $24.14 Masters Therapist $29.93 Step 3 \u2014 Conduct Additional Research to Inform Key Assumptions This section discusses the research findings and assumptions for ERE and program -related cost components. ERE In addition to wages, the following ERE components were considered for both the Direct Care and Indirect Care staff: Health Insurance. Unemployment Taxes (Federal and State). Worker's Compensation Insurance. FICA. Other Benefits (short -term disability, long-term disability, and retirement). The amounts included in the rates represent the employer's share of the costs for these items. The ERE cost component was approximately 20% to 35% of the total wages amount, depending on staff position. Other Program -related Costs In addition to ERE, other program -related costs were considered including costs for training, fidelity, consultation, staff travel, and administrative expenses. Training, Fidelity, and Consultation Consideration was made for standard expenses (including registration, material, and travel) for ongoing and initial training, fidelity, and consultation. PROMISE SERVICE CERTIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT MANUAL 236 Staff Travel and Beneficiary Transportation The ACT rates include consideration for staff travel and beneficiary transportation expenses. The annual mileage for this service was estimated by taking an assumed number of miles tr aveled per day (based on discussions with the State) and multiplying by the total billable days worked each year. The resulting annual mileage was assumed to be paid at the IRS standard mileage rate. Administration Expenses Costs associated with general administrative expenses such as management, equipment and supplies, recruitment, information technology, human resources, billing, finance, and accounting, legal and other indirect costs necessary for program operations were also considered. The assumption was based on discussions with the State. Step 4 \u2014 Work with the State to Finalize Key Pricing Assumptions This section discusses the key consideration reflected in the assumptions for the remaining cost components. Productivity Adjustments For ACT, adjustments to account for non -billable staff time were also considered. Non -billable staff time includes time for training, PTO, and a portion of each workday that is spent on usual and required non -billable activities. Consideration for this non -billable time was included in the rate through a productivity adjustment. The staffing cost (i.e., cost for Direct Care and Indirect Care staff) was adjusted by a factor that accounted for the total billable time relative to the total staff time. Fee Schedule Summary Please see the ACT/ICM Billing Guidance section for the final fees selected by the State. Limitations and Caveats In preparing the fee ranges, Mercer considered publicly available market information, provider invoice data, and guidance from the State. We reviewed the data and information for internal consistency and reasonableness, but have not audited them. If the data or information is incomplete or inaccurate, the values may need to be revised accordingly. Fees developed by Mercer are projections of future contingent events. Actual provider costs may differ from these projections. Mercer has developed these fees on behalf of the State to support the delivery of ACT/ICM services. Use of these fees for any purpose beyond that s tated may not be appropriate. Potential ACT/ICM fee schedule service providers are advised that the use of these fees may not be appropriate for their particular circumstance, and Mercer disclaims any responsibility for the use of these fees by providers for any purpose. Mercer recommends that any organization considering contracting with the State should analyze its own projected expenses and revenue needs for comparison to the fees offered by the State before deciding whether to contract with the State. This methodology document assumes the reader is familiar with the ACT/ICM program and projection techniques. It is intended for the State and should not be relied upon by third parties. Other readers should seek advice of qualified professionals to understand the technical nature of these results. This document should only be reviewed in its entirety. "}
