I provide each person my complete attention, while seeking the underlying cause of imbalance. I know that everyone is unique and their characteristics, lifestyle and environment are all taken into account in order to treat the whole person. After graduating from McMaster University with a BA in Social Sciences, I moved to South Korea to teach English and travel throughout Asia. I was intrigued with Traditional Chinese Medicine, and on my return to Canada, I attended The Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine. Once I completed my four year doctorate degree, including my one year internship at the Robert Schad Naturopathic Clinic, I opened my own clinic called Naturopathic Roots in Brantford, Ontario. Although I see people of all ages, I have developed a special interest in women's health, especially fertility, pre and post natal care, and children's health. My commitment is to constantly evaluate new theories, research and approaches in medicine while still respecting the power of traditional natural healing. I am eager to show people how naturopathic medicine can improve their health and wellness. My favorite naturopathic modalities include nutrition, herbal medicine, and homeopathic drainage.
