Welcome! Congratulations on your acceptance into the Summer U ndergraduate Research Program (SURP) , hosted by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Fred Hutch )! Like most students, you're probably thrilled about this opportunity and at the same time, apprehensive about living and working in a new environment. This handbook is designed to help you successfully transition from student to intern by detailing all aspects of the program; from getting to Seattle and working at the Fred Hutch to maximizing your internship experience. Perhaps the most valuable insigh t comes from SURP alumni, whose feedback is catalogued throughout this handbook with the header, Alumni Advice : You will likely refer to this handbook often, so be sure to keep it handy! About the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Fred Hutch) Founding Established in 1975, the mission of the Fred Hutch is to eliminat e cancer and related diseases as causes of human suffering and death. Founding members are credited with pioneering bone - marrow transplantation as a successful treatment for leukemia an d other blood diseases. Today, the Fred Hutch leads research to understand, treat , and prevent cancer, HIV/AIDS , and other life-threatening diseases. Recognized as one of 41 comprehensive cancer research centers nationwide , the Fred Hutch employs more than 2,700 scientists and staff and is home to three Nobel laureates [E. Donnall Thomas, MD (1990); Lee Hartwell, PhD (2001); and Linda Buck, PhD (2004)]. To learn more about the Fred Hutch , visit: www. fredhutch .org. A collection of 40 things you didn't know about Fred Hutch can be accessed here: ks South Lake Union . Who was Fred Hutchinson? Fred Hutchinson is one of Seattle 's biggest sports heroes -a former major league baseball player and manager who died of lung cancer at age 45. Fred Hutch was founded by Dr. Will iam Hutchinson in honor of his brother . To learn more about the history of Bill and Fred Hutchinson, including the founding of the Fred Hutch , visit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XqQQmorpdY Alumni Advice: When you tell people where you are work ing/worked this summer, the question you will get asked more than any other is, \"Who was Fred Hutchinson? \" So you might as well commit the answer to memory! 4 Scientific Divisions The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center consists of five research divisions: Basic Sciences, Clinic al Research, Human Biology, Public Health Sciences , and Vaccine and Infectious Disease . Each division has its own unique research focus. Basic Sciences: http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/basic -sciences.html The Basic Sciences division encompasses ~27 independent and highly interactive laboratories working in diverse areas related to all aspects of biolog y. The labs employ structural, genetic, molecular, cellular, developmental, and evolutionary biology methods to address unresolved questions in biology using a wide range of model systems , including viruses, bacteria, yeast, nematode worms, fruit flies, zebrafish, mice , and humans. This wide spectrum of models enables a thorough analysis of the internal workings of cells as well as studies of the complex interactions Seth Bensussen and his mentor , Bicheng Han.

The work conducted by its members establish ed marrow transplantation as a clinical procedure capable of curing thousands of patients of hematologic malignancies and other diseases of the blood and immune systems. The division was honored in 1990 when E. Donnall Thomas, former division director, was awa rded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his contributions to understanding the immunology of marrow transplantation. Home to more than 100 faculty members, the Clinical Research division recorded several \"firsts\" in cancer research and treatmen t, including : Developing the first FDA -approved antibody -targeted chemotherapy, making chemotherapy less toxic and more effective. Successfully using a patient's cloned infection -fighting T cells as the sole therapy to put melanoma into long -term remission without radiation or chemotherapy .

Finding a way to break through the unique biological defense that pancreatic cancer uses to resist chemotherapy . Alumni Advice: Talk to as many people at the Hutch as possible \u2014they are all incredible individuals with fascinating stories of how they came to the Fred Hutch . Human Biology: http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/hu manbio/about -the-division.html The goal of the Human Biology division is to cultivate interdisciplinary research focused on human biology and to increase ongoing research on solid tumor cancer s and other complex human diseases . HB f aculty have expertise in molecular and cell biology, genomics, genetics, virology, infectious disease, computational biology, pathology , and clinical research . Human Biology - sponsored research typically blends fundamental, applied, and translational techniques, which are often performed in model organisms and in vitro systems. Public Health Sciences : http://www. fredhutch .org/en/labs/phs/about.html The mission of the Public Health Sciences division is to identify strategies that will reduce the incidence of and mortality fro m cancer and other diseases. Using large human populations as their \"laboratory, \" PHS faculty focus on determining causes of cancer, identif ying and assess ing effective screening and treatment methods, developing prevention strategies that reduce the risk of cancer, and developing research strategies to help people adopt healthier lifestyles to minimize or avoid disease risk . This prevention oriented research also extends to other diseases, including HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and fractures . Thomas Rodriguez and Dr. Nina Salama.

To learn more about your mentor's research interests, please visit the Arnold Library's Resea rcher Profiles page at: http://sharedresources.fhcrc.org/profile . To learn more about your mentor's lab or research group, please visit the Hutchinson Center's lab homepage at: http://labs.fhcrc.org/ . To reference your faculty or staff mentors' public ations , please visit Google or Pub Med Central at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ (simply type your mentor's n ame in the search category at the top of the page). You may also be able to view your faculty mentor 's scientific presentations via YouTube . If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants. - Sir Isaac Newton Staff Mentor In most cases, interns will work in their faculty mentor's lab /research group under the direct guidanc e of a staff mentor, such as a staff scientist, post-doctoral fellow or graduate student. While you will have opportunities to interact with your faculty mentor, you will have more direct, routine interaction with your staff mentor. Working with a staff me ntor presents a great opportunity to inquire about preparing for and succeeding in graduate or medical school, pursuing a research career, etc. Preparing for the I nternship Mentor Interaction You should expect your faculty or staff mentor to initiate conta ct with you about six to eight weeks prior to start of SURP . If you haven't had any prior communicat ion with your staff mentor, feel free to contact him/her via email and inquire how to best prepare for this experience . To obtain your staff mentors' emai l address, enter their first and last name in the Fred Hutch directory at: http://www.fredhutch.org/en/util/directory.html Alumni Advice: Your [internship] experience is literally what you make of it and whether you decide to capitalize on networking opportunities. To prepare for this experience, I took one day out of the week to read a paper that outlined studies done in my host lab. This was important because I knew background information prior to starting the internship. Suggested Readings This list of optional reading may prove helpful to your prepar ation for a career in biomedical research: The Guide to Life Science Careers helps you explore career options by starting with an assessm ent of who you are and how you work best.

Interns are asked to print the new employee documents (or non-employee documents for students whose salary is covered by another funding source ) and bring the signed materials to the SURP orientation that starts at 9 am on Mon day, June 17 in the Arnold Building, conference room s M4-A805/81 7, along with proper ID (original and 1 photocopy ) for submission to Human Resources staff. University of Washington (UW) Housing Application The UW housing application will be supplied as a separate link via email. We anticipate the applications will be available in late March. Please be aware that the UW Conference Services operates independent of the Fred Hutch ; therefore questions about housing should be directed via email to: hfscon@uw.edu or phone at: (206) 543 -7636. SURP Intern s Funded by Other Sources, i.e., Home Institution, MARC, Whitman College The Summer Undergraduate Research Program welcomes students whose salary is covered by another funding source, such as their home institution , the MARC program, Whitman College , or an individual F red Hutch lab/research group . The federal government strictly prohibits individuals Suzzallo Library , University of Washington . Photo credit: Turner Construction. I never thought of stopping, and I jus t hated sleepin g. I can't imagine having a bett er life. - Barbara McClintock from receiving two overlapping sources of federal funding [the Summer Undergraduate Research Program is supported in parts by a Cancer Cent er Support Grant (CCSG) and a U54 award , both of which are funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) ]; therefore the information on the following pages regarding salary, travel reimbursement, ground transportation, etc. does not apply to students whose salary is covered by another funding source. Students sponsored by a Fred Hutch lab/ research group will negotiate their status as a paid employee or volunteer directly with their host lab/research group. Any compensation received is independent of the Summer Undergraduate Research Program. 10 11What is Expected of YOU as a SURP Intern It takes a significant amount of time to prepare for the arrival of summer interns. As part of this preparation, SURP staff and mentors need to communicate with students prior to their arrival; therefore: Check your email frequently prior to and during the internship and respond promptl y. Notify staff immediately if your participation in the SURP or travel/housing plans change . To ensure a productive and mutually beneficial internship experience, SURP interns will: Work a full -time schedule [40 hours per week] . Report sick days or any planned absences directly to: 1) staff mentor; and 2) SURP staff . Refrain from cell phone, i -pod, Skype, Facebook, and any other multi -media distr action s during work hours . Be mindful of the fact that you are working in a shared workspace; visits to the lab/offic e among family, friends, and/or significant others should be limited . Demonstrate a willingness to learn. Be responsible, accountable, an d use initiative ! Take time to interact with your faculty and staff mentor s, other staff/lab members, and fello w interns. You will benefit greatly from the exchange of diverse academic and researc h experiences . In addition to conducting a mentored researc h project, SURP interns will participate in professional development workshops to facilitate the preparation of competitive applications for graduate or medical school , attend weekly research seminars regarding a broad array of scientific topics, and parti cipate in after-hours 'mixers' to interact with Fred Hutch faculty, staff, and fellow trainees on an individual basis . Participate in all SURP -sponsored activities. Notify staff when you cannot participate in an event . Be prepared to ask questions and a ctively participate in these sessions ! Submit program -sponsored assignments [ pre-survey, personal statement, resume , abstrac t, poster, program evaluation , and post -survey ] on time. It is expected that these assignmen ts will be completed outside of work hours. The SURP sponsors a number of social activities to foster interaction among interns and staff. Plan to attend SURP -sponsored social activities unless it conflicts with work time . Notify staff immediately if you cannot attend a particular even t. In ord er to demonstrate the efficacy of the SURP and continually improve the quality of Fred Hutch - sponsored internship s, we need to learn about student's academic and career activities post-program . Staff will follow -up with you after the SURP has concluded to learn whether you are pursuing graduate or medical school or a biomedical research -related career. Plan to participate in follow -up communication [Annual Training Program Follow -up Surve y] with SURP staff . The nine -week internship will be over before you know it. Take time to enjoy every minute of the experience and most importantly, have FUN ! Traveling to Seattle Airfare /Ground The SURP will cover the cost of travel to and from Seattle (up to $ 450.00). If you choose to fly to Seattle, please email you r preferred airline itinerary to Marilyn Drennan (mdrennan@fredhutch.org ) with the following information on or before Friday , April 19: 1) Preferred airfare itinerary; 2) Full name as it appears on your driver's license; 3) Date of birth ; 4)Cell phone number; and 5) Seating preference i.e., window, middle, aisle . The program will pre - pay for your airfare and email the itinerary to you. If you prefer to drive to Seattle, the 2019 Internal Revenue Services standa rd mileage rate of $.58 will be multiplied by the number of miles driven to determine your reimbursement; however you cannot receive reimbursement above the $450.00 travel cap (e.g. Las Cruces , NM is approximately 1,568 miles away from Seattle. 1,568 mile s multiplied by $. 58 equals $ 909.44 , but the maximum roundtrip reimbursement that can be claimed is $450.00). Students are eligible to receive mileage reimbursement after having arrived in Seattle. To request reimbursement, students are asked to send an email to Marilyn Drennan (mdrennan @fredhutch.org ) that includes: 1) date of departure; departure city/state; 3) date of arrival; 4) arrival city/state; 5) number of miles driven. A reimbursement check will be issued approximately two weeks after submitting mileage information . From the Airport Students are responsible for coordinating their ground transportation arrangements to and from the Seattle -Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac). Taxi, Lyft/Uber, town car, and shuttle services are located on the third floor of the parking garage at Sea -Tac. Shuttle or town car reservations need to be made at least 24 -hours in advance. SeaTac is located at: 17801 International Blvd Seattle, WA 98158 . Students who choose to live at the University of Washington will check in at Lander Hall front desk, located on the corner of NE Campus Parking and Brooklyn Avenue at: 1201 NE Campus Parkway Seattle, WA 98105 . It will take ~35 minutes to get from Sea -Tac to the Univer sity of Washington campus with little to no traffic. It can take up to an hour or more to get from Sea -Tac to the University of Washington campus in rush hour, which runs from approximately 7:30 - 9:30 am and 3 - 6 pm. Check -in for interns planning to liv e in the dorms on the UW campus will take place between 2 -5 pm on Sunday, June 16; therefore program staff will carefully coordinate your airfare arrangements to ensure that you arrive at SeaTac before 3 pm . A list of ground transportation options is pr ovided below. Shuttle Express Go to: www.shuttleexpress.com to select your preferred pick -up and drop -off locations, as well as the estimated time of arrival/departure, and pay to confirm your spot. The approxi mate fare from Sea -Tac to the University of Washington is approximately $30 each way. Sound Transit: Central Link Light Rail (Train) travels between SeaTac Airport and UW Husky Stadium . The Light Rail runs every 6, 10, or 15 minutes depending on the time o f day. Service is available from 5 am to 1 am Monday through Saturday and from 6 am to midnight on Sunday and holidays. Adult fares range from $2 .25 to $3 .25 depending on how far you travel. Tickets Seattle is home to landmarks like the Space Needle. 12 must be purchased at various kiosks before boarding the Link. To plan your trip, visit : http://www.soundtransit.org/Trip -Planner or call: (206) 398 -5000. Please note: Although SURP alumni recommend taking the Light Rail from Sea -Tac to the University of Washington campus , it is important to note that there is not a direct route , meaning you will cart your luggage to the Light Rail station at Sea -Tac Airport and get off the Light Rail at the University of Washington /Husky Stadium Statio n, which is 0.8 mile s from Lander Hall, where you will check -in for UW housing. There are numerous buses that depart from near the UW Light Rail station to Lander Hall (bus 43, 44, 48, 271, 540, 541, 542, 554, 556, 71, or 73) . Check Google\u00ae maps on your phone for the qui ckest route! After check ing in at Lander Hall, you will then walk to Stevens court. This is not only time -consuming, but requires very careful schedule coordination between the Light Rail and Metro bus. Students who opt to use the Light Rail to get to and from Sea-Tac are strongly encouraged to plan their route and confirm the timetables well in advance of departure . Seattle Yellow Cab Call (206) 622 -6500. The approximate fare from Sea -Tac to the University of Washington at $2.50/mile is $50 each way. *If the cost of airfare is less than $450, the SURP will reimburse students for the cost of luggage fees and/or ground transportation to and from the airport. A receipt denoting the cost of these items is required for reimbursement . Please submit ground transpor tation and/or luggage receipts to Marilyn at the SURP orientation ( Monday, June 17) or shortly thereafter . A reimbursement check will be issued approximately two weeks after submitting travel receipts. Alumni Advice : Take advantage of the travel table [tha t staff distribute a few weeks prior to the start of the program] to coordinate ground transportation with other interns who are arriving/departing from SeaTac around the same time . I shared a Shuttle Express van with interns whom I had contacted in advanc e, which reduced the cost of travel . Living in Seattle Housing at the University of Washington Housing is available at the University of Washington 's Steven s Court , which is located at: 3801 Brooklyn Ave NE, Seattle, WA 98105 . Steven's Court features sh ared apartment units that are furnished with twin beds, sofa, table & chairs, dresser, desk, and Ethernet access. Four to six rooms share a bath, living room, and kitchen facilities with other guests of their same gender. The rooms are not air -conditioned. Laundry Laundry facilities are available in each dorm on the UW campus. Students will need to purchase a pre -loaded debit card at the front desk. There are no refunds for unused money. UW Housing Cost The cost for housing is $ 40 per person, per night. A $250 reservation deposit is due with the submission of the housing application; the UW encourages early applications because housing inventory is limited. **Payment is due in full before check -in on Sunday, June 16. At minimum, the total cost for housing will be $ 2,480 [this was calculated based on check -in on Sunday, June 16 and check -out on Saturday, August 17, which is 62 nights, multiplied by $ 40]. If you subtract the $250 deposit from that total, the amount due before check -in will be $2,230. The UW is Stevens Court , University of Washington. 13 implementing an online registration form, which allows you to pay any time before check in. You can choose to either pay the remaining $2, 230 in install ments or as a lump sum, depending on your preference and availability of funds. Just be sure that yo u have paid the entire balance prior to check in! **Since housing payment [for interns who choose to live in the dorms at the UW] is due in full before check -in on Sunday, June 16 (in the amount of $ 2,230) and your first paycheck won't be issued until five days later on Friday, June 21 (in the amount of $3,100), please let Marilyn (mdrennan@fredhutch.org ) know if you do NOT have access to a credit card to apply this expense to, in which case, we will discuss paym ent options; one being to reimburse the SURP for covering the cost of housing upon check -in. For More Information about UW Housing You can learn more about summer housing at the University of Washington by visiting: https://hfs.uw.edu/Live/Housing -Locations/Stevens -Court You may also take a virtual tour of the facility at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRP4uAuX_l0 . Questions about housing at the University of Washington, including roommate assignments, may be directed via email to: hfsinfo@uw.edu or phone at: (206) 543 -4059 . Mandatory Housing Orientation Stevens Co urt summer residents are require d to complet e an online orientation prior to check in. This link will be provided in an email confirmation. Guests will NOT be permitted to check in until the online orientation has been completed. Check -in Location and Hours Upon receipt of a $250 reservation deposit, you will receive a confirmation letter from the UW that provides additional check -in information. ***Check -in takes place on Sunday, June 16 from 2 -5 pm at the Lander Hall front desk, which is located on the corner of NE Campus Parkway and Brooklyn Ave at: 1201 NE Campus Parkway Seattle, WA 98105. Please note: The UW is doing the Fred Hutch a Alumni Advice : The part of the internship that I enjoyed the most was the intern community. It was such a unique experience to be surrounded by so many fun and intelligent peers, all with similar academic interests. While I definitely learned a lot from the weekly research seminars, I may have learned even more from the other interns just by interacting with them on a daily basis. I don't think this is a kind of learning experience that you encounter very often and I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to be a part of this community. tremendous favor by allowing our trainees to access housing early; therefore we appreciate your consideration and flexibility in the event that a room is not ready for you upon check -in. Questions or concerns about check -in at Lander Hall may be directed via email to: hfsinfo@uw.edu or phone at: (206) 543-4059 SURP Alumni Perspec Advantages / Disadvantages of Living in the UW Dorms I would absolutely tell [future interns] to live on campus! I thought this Cost + was going to be terrible, but while it WAS expensive, I made some great friends! 14 -UW housing is significantly more expensive than finding a sublet. It is about half the stipend once taxes have been taken out. Time/Convenience + The housing at UW was convenient because we could take the free shuttle to work. -I lived at home, so I commuted everyday about 45 minutes each way. This made it difficult to have the social interaction many of the other interns had. Social Interaction + Make sure you live on campus! I know it is tempting to save some money with off-campus housing, but creating this community of interns turned this into the most magical summer of my life. -The one regret I have living at home instead of at the dorms with the rest of the interns. Amenities + Laundry facilities on-site!! -The apartments are dorm-like with one bathroom unit that includes two side-by-side showers and two side-by-side toilet stalls for six people to share. The rooms are a decent size, but the space does not compare to the price. It is hard to maintain accountability for cleanliness in an apartment situation that is so large. Expectations + I would recommend staying in the dorms, they are a really good deal for the area and you know what you are getting. I chose to live off campus and it was a mistake. Although the pictures of the apartment looked nice online, in person it was a completely different story. -It might be helpful to remind people that these are dorm room quality, they're pretty unfur nished, and the UW adminis tration can be difficult to deal with. Also, there is no temperature regulation so in the begin ning of the summe r it's freezing and by the end the rooms are humid and way hotter than outsi de. Having said that, they are the most convenient and not-too-expe nsive choice, so people just need to be aware of what to expect. What Should I Bring if I Pla n to Live in the UW Dorms ? Dining/cookware, utensils, and kitchen towels Tupperware Cleaning supplies Pillow Bed linens Bath linens HangersIf it's important, you'll find a way. If it's not, you'll find an excuse. - Daniel Decker 15 Laundry bag Alumni Advice: If you have your own portable grocery bag(s), bring them since they are mandated by Wash ington state law.

Alumni Advice : I considered the daily hours flexible. It ultimately depends on how much you want to get out of your research experience. The more experiments you want to do, the less flexible your schedule becomes. I found the best way to maximize my experience and the flexibility of my schedule was using Google Calendar. I planned my lab schedule a week ahead and shared my calendar with my daily mentor ... Sharing this schedule with my daily mentor allowed them to adjust their schedule so she could be available to help me if needed.

Bloodborne Pathogens Training SURP staff communicate with faculty and staff mentors of all incoming trainees to identify any training that is required before you are permitted to conduct certain aspects of your research project. If your mentor indicates that part of the work you will be doing will involve exposure to blood, body fluids or other potentially infectious materials, the Fred Hutch requires that you comple te Bloodborne Pathogens (BBP) Training and provide medical documentation of your Hepatitis B vaccination status before you are introduced to the safe handling of these materials in your lab. If the research project you are contributing to will involve exp osure to potentially infectious materials, SURP staff will contact you a few weeks prior to the start of your internship to indicate whether or not you need to complete this training; however when you initiate correspondence with your faculty and staff men tors in the weeks prior to you arrival, you may want to ask if you need to complete Bloodborne Pathogens and/or Confidentiality or Human Subjects training (see the criteria for completing Confidentiality or Human Subjects training in the sections below). Interns who will be working with blood or other potentially infectious materials are recommended to have the series of three Hepatitis B vaccines. The three Hepatitis B vaccines are typically administered in childhood; therefore you are asked to collect yo ur Hepatitis B vaccine records and bring them to BBP training ( if the research project you are contributing to will involve exposure to blood, body fluids or other potentially infectious materials ). It generally takes 1 -2 weeks to collect these records, so we recommend that you start the process of collecting this 2013 SURP interns attend a panel presentation featuring Fred Hutch faculty and Timothy Ray Brown, also known as 'The Berlin Patient '; the first person cured of HIV . Photo credit: Bo Jungmayer. 32 documentation at least two weeks before the start of your internship . A photocopy of your medical records is allowable . While supplying a copy of your records is best, it is acceptable if you are not able to submit the required documentation. At minimum, it would help if you know whether or not you have had the 3 Hepatitis B vaccines. **If you have NOT had three Hepatitis B vaccines or if you do not know if you have had the vaccine, you can inform the Occupational Health Nurse whether or not you would like to receive the Hepatitis B vaccine, which will be offered at the conclusion of Bloodborne Pathogens training.** Confidentiality Training All Center employees who have routine contact with or access to the identifiable health information of research participants must complete confidentiality training . Please check with your mentor to determine whether you need to complete this training . Questions can be directed to the training department via e-mail at: training@fredhutch.org or phone at : (206) 667- 7740 . Human Subjects Training Human subjects training is required for investigators and staff involved in the design, conduct, or reporting of human subjects research conducted at Fred Hutch . Please check with your mentor or visit: https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/irb/training/human -subjects.html to determine wh ether you need to complete this training and to view course options and schedules. Intern Deliverables The SURP is designed to provide mentored research experience and expose students to biological research careers. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the program and help students prepare for graduate, medical or professional school, interns are asked to submit the following deliverables: Pre-and post -survey In order to measure the program's impact on students' intention to pursue a career in biol ogical research, interns will be asked to complete a pre -and post -survey via SurveyMonkey . Your willingness to participate in the surveys is voluntary. 2015 interns climb the Howe Street stairs. The stairs ar e ~1 mile from the Fred Hutch campus. After climbing 9 sets of stairs at 14 steps each, you can enjoy unobstructed views of Lake Union from Capitol Hill (meanwhile catching your breath). Mark Tom presents his research findings to Dr. Barry Robinson. Hockenbery Lab, Clinical Research. Photo credit: Clayton Hibbert . 33 Personal statement, resume, abstract, poster Students will be placed into peer-review group s [consisti ng of one to two other interns and a F red Hutch staff scientist, post -doctoral fellow, graduate student, etc .] to review and evaluate their respective personal statement and resume. A peer-review template will be provided to help guide the focus of feedba ck per writing sample. Interns should seek feedback from their mentor and/or affiliated lab/research group members when drafting their 250-word abstract and compiling poster content . Students are expected to submit the final version of their personal sta tement, resume, abstract, and poster during the final week of the SURP. Alumni Advice: I would recommend completing a first draft of your personal statement and resume before the start of the internship because you have so much other work to do once the program starts. Program evaluation In order to continually improve various aspects of the program, students will receive an electronic version of the SURP program evaluation at the start of the internship. Trainees are asked to evaluate activities through out the nine -week internship as opposed to at the conclusion of the program. Staff rely on responses within the evaluation to modify the There's two possible outcomes: if the result confirms the hypothesis, then you've made a dis covery. If the result is contrary to the hypothesis, then you've made a dis covery. - Enrico Fer mi program; therefore students are encoura ged to provide candid feedback. Training program follow -up survey In order to d emonstrate the efficacy of the SURP in helping student s' achieve their respective academic /career goals , the program will administer an annual training program follow -up questionnaire via SurveyMonkey . Your willingness to participate in this survey is vol untary. Establish and Maintain Connections The program has created a Facebook account to allow incoming interns, alumni, and program staff to interact and share information about academic and career opportunities internal and external to the F red Hutch. Facebook: [www.facebook.com/fhcrcinternships ]; Alumni Advice: All of the interns joined a Facebook group that we used to organize activities so that we could all hang out and get to know each other.

Express appreciation for your mentor s time and show a genuine interest in the project you are working on. Try to learn as much aboutthe project as you can remember you are making a critical contri bution to the project! Know what is expected of you and ask questions if you are uncertain. Alumni Advice: Be prepared to fail at things the first few times and don't take it personally! Be flexible: recognize that your daily work hours may fluctuate based on the needs of your project. Manage your time well. Completing your research project is the primary objective ; however there will be other demands on your time. Out of respect for your mentor and other staff , do NOT procrastinate! Alumni Advice : Don' t take online classes. Don't even consider taking an online course over the summer. No matter how dedicated you are to academia, those classes will take up a lot of your time and during this program, time is precious. Plan to attend all SURP sponsored acti vities unless it conflicts with a work commitment . Know WHERE you need to be and WHEN you need to be there . Alumni Advice : I would recommend going to the seminars at all costs. There is no substitute for hearing innovative research from the very people w ho make it. The nine week internship will be over before you know it. Stay in contact with your mentors and SURP staff after the program concludes you will inevitably need academic/career guidance and/or recommendation letter in the future. Plus , mentors and SURP staff find it greatly rewarding to follow the academic /career pursuits and achievements of their trainees. Alumni Advice : I was concerned about graduate and medical school applications, tests, etc. but the SURP prepares you tremendo usly to handle all these aspects. So, take a seat back and think before submitting things or making decisions about career choices because this experience has the potential to transform your perspective and open your eyes to options you may not have consid ered before. Make sure to communicate with people and tell them what your plans are so they can offer excellent advice and mentorship. I guarantee someone here has been there, done that, and made it. SURP Staff Bios and Contact Information Before moving to Seattle and the Fred Hutch in 1996, my life was spent East of the Potomac River. I thought I wanted to be an educational policy wo nk and I went to a nice, small college in Connecticut famous for its public policy programs, Wesleyan University. As a f irst-semester freshman, I filled my schedule with government and history courses. There was a pesky distribution requirement, which required me to squeeze a science course somewhere in my schedule. The only course that fit was an 8AM organic chemistry cl ass (cue the Hallmark card commercial background music ). My professor for that course, Dr. Peter Jacobi, turned what most students experience as a dry, soulless exercise in rote memorization into a vibrant intellectual puzzle. I was hooked. I spent the n ext three years squeezing government course s into my chemistry -packed schedule. In graduate school at Columbia University , I got hooked on opera and good food , but still managed to get a PhD. As a post -doc, I decided to try to use organic chemistry and t he ability to make compounds to study biological systems. When I came to the Hutch , I continued with this work trying to find and improve compounds that would regulate biological systems for therapeutic ends. My lab is currently working on drug developme nt projects including prevention of hearing loss as a side effect of chemotherapeutic drugs and anti -lymphoma agents. In Seattle I discovered the great outdoors and the amazing mountains of the Northwest. It's very likely that the rest of my life will be spent West of the Columbia River. I grew up in Colorado, where I basked in 245 days of sunshine a year. Craving change, I enrolled at the University of Oregon (Sco Ducks!), where I was introduced to the great Pacific Northwest - and an average of 15 7 days of sunshine per year. Six years later, I have finally adjusted to the rain and can't imagine living anywhere but the good ol' PNW. I graduated from UO in 2016 with a Bachelor of Arts in Comparative Literature, Classics, and a minor in Journalism . Despite my academic pedigree qualifying me as the poster child for a liberal arts education, I started working with the Summer Program for Undergraduate Research (SPUR) in Biology at UO. Thanks to my experience there, I was hired as the coordinator for the SURP at Fred Hutch and moved to Seattle in October 2016. Since I am relatively new to Seattle, I love getting out and exploring all the city has to offer. My passion is travel (to anywhere but Perugia, Italy , for obvious reasons), so I am always accepting suggestions on which country to visit next! Recently I have become obsessed with true crime, and love discussing murder with fellow 'murderinos.' I also love to hike, bake - albeit often poorly - cook, read, and lounge a round with my cat, Birdie . Julian Simon, PhD Assoc. Member, Email : mdrennan@fredhutch.org Office: Arnold, M3-A889 mwalter@fredhutch.org Office: Arnold, M3 -A884 I grew up north of Seattle and have lived in the Evergreen state my entire life. I attended the University of Washington (Go Dawgs!!) and graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Biology in 2012. After graduating, I spent six years managing a local coffee shop where I learned the ins and outs of the coffee industry, operating a small business, and communicating with people from all walks of life. At some point I realized that small business management just wasn't for me and I craved a change of pace. I stumbled upon the opportunity to apply for a job as a program assistant at the Fred Hutch and was lucky enough to be offered a position with the Summer Undergraduate Research Program. I am so grateful to be working for such an amazing institution and I have learned so much over the past year here at the Hutch. In my freetime I like to experience some of the things that make Sea ttle unique like catching a Mariners game on a sunny day or seeing live music in one of the many concert venues around the city! Admittedly, I have an obsession with Netflix documentaries and true crime podcasts, and welcome any and all suggestions for my next fix! I love a good adventure around the city just as much as I love a lazy Saturday at home with my fianc\u00e9 and our pomeagle, Dexter. 37 General Information about the F red Hutch Campus Map Campus Key A,B = Weintraub LA = Aloha = Study Participant Parking C = Hutchinson LF = Fairview D = Thomas LM = Minor = Building Entrance G = SCCA LV = Valley = SCCA Parking HK = Hutch Kids M = Arnold = Bus Stop J = Yale E = Eastlake Deciphering Mail Stops Say that you are asked to attend a meeting in B1 -072.

Join the movement. Ride. Walk. Donate. Volunteer. Tell others. Ending cancer starts at the Fred Hutch . To learn more about SURP Alumni 'Words of Wisdom' Prepare yourself for one of the most memorable research experiences. Become familiar with the work being d one in your mentor's l ab and prepare to immerse yourself in your research project. If you are feeling any doubts about your project, remember that you have world -class scientists to help guide you. My number one piece of advice is to not be shy. You are an undergraduate and peo ple know that. Being awkward and trying to get to know people in your lab is all part of the experience. Take initiative and utilize the wealth of resources you have available to you at the Hutch from the start. In other words, seek advice from the program staff about your career goals and get connected with a varie ty of Hutch employees who are currently working in the field in which you see yourself. Their advice will be invaluable to your experience. The advice I would share with incoming interns is to be open about the experience, be willing to try new things, and NETWORK with people! I feel I have made some lifelong friends during my time in Seattle; they are the only people I can share this experienc e with, including my many fun memories. Learn how to m anage your time well because the deadlines do creep up on you. That's not to say that you aren't given sufficient time, it's just you have to be aware of it and not get SO caught up in your research project. Be aware that you have program -sponsored activit ies and assignments, as well as tasks assigned by your mentor; they are both equally important. Don't procrastinate or put anything off because they are all worthwhile learning opportunities. 2013 SURP interns volunteering at Obliteride . Kristen Miller and V inny Lizzio .

Don't be afraid to ask everyone in your lab questions, not jus t about your project but about themselves and their experiences. I learned a lot about working in industry vs. working in academia just by talking to the people in my lab. I would recommend that future students read as many relevant papers as they can from the lab they'll be joining. Also, do some brainstorming or come into the program with a draft personal statement for graduate school or medical school. Don't take the entrance exam the summer you do this internship -take it before or after the program co ncludes . I would absolutely tell future SURP interns to live at the dorms on the UW campus! This is the best way to maximize interactions with other students in the program and make some great friends! Be a sponge this summer. Coming from all over the coun try, everyone has a different and unique back ground, so it is invaluable to learn from one another and gain perspective. An experience like this is about meeting new, incredible people: from the members of your research lab to your fellow interns to other PIs at the Hutch. So don't be shy and ask questions! If you have a P.I that sees patient in the clinic, I recommend shadowing him/her as a complement to your research. Ask your mentor for experimental procedures if workin g in a lab and review them before the internship starts. Don't be intimidated by a lot of people a whole lot smarter than you here. That's the point. Ask questions incessantly, work diligently for the 9 weeks, foster relationships with everyone you meet (any contact here is a good one to have), and you will come out with a great experience. Definitely do your research beforehand. You want to know all you can about your PI's research. It's so simple; just Google their name or use PudMed Online. You can read just about any paper your men tor has published, even if it's just the abstract. Really make sure you understand the purpose of your project and don't be afraid to talk over with your mentor the steps you need to take to get there. Don't ask them to outline it for you, do the work, but try to really understand what you're doing, how, and why. The time flies so don't hesitate to get a jump on things.

SURP Alumni Recommended Group Activities Host a progressive dinner where interns in different dorms (or in off -site housing) prepare a different meal and/or beverage, i.e., appetizers, main course, dessert, etc. Organize a group run to the Howe Street stairs! Y ou can see pictures of the stairs and read reviews about them here: https://www.yelp.com/biz/howe -street -stairs - seattle?osq=Howe+Street+stairs Host a potluck dinner! Form a GRE or MCAT study group and meet at a different coffee shop or library each week as a way to explore Seattle . Karao ke at the Rock Box - a Japanese style karaoke club in Capitol Hill. They have 11 private rooms that accommodate 1 to 15 people and one large party room that can accommodate up to 35 people. Patrons must be 21 years of age or older. Go on a food tour! Sa vor Seattle hosts seven different food and wine tasting tours that explore the history, culture, and food that makes Seattle a top culinary destination. Our lab manager took a fellow, intern, and I to the Seattle Bouldering Project in Sodo. It is easily ac cessible by public transportation and you can get an all -day pass to spend as much time as you'd like at the gym (which also has a caf\u00e9!) It has courses there are amenable to climbers of any level. Coordinate a weekend restaurant dinner gathering as a way to explore different neighborhoods in and around the Seattle area. We are at the very beginning of time for the human race. It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems. But there are tens of thousands of years in the future. Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on. Richard Feynman 44 "}
