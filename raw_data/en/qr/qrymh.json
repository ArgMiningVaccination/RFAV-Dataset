We understand that many students at this level of preparation do not have the opportunity for clinical ex- perience in a psychiatric setting, but they will encounter patients with mental health issues in their rotations. Students will encounter patients and their families with psychiatric diagnoses as well as a variety of psychosocial issues and behaviors that challenge them. This text will provide the basic knowledge and skills to address many of these challenges, with an emphasis on communication. This new edition also brings enhancements via the Internet through DavisPlus. Our goal with this text is to provide basic information about mental health theories, personality development, coping and com- munication styles, psychiatric diagnoses, and nursing actions, all as they pertain to the prac- tice of the LVN/LPN. The impact of psychiatric disorders con- tinues to be a concern in the United States. Depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and substance abuse continue to be major health problems. How society responds to debilitat- ing mental illness has been the subject of much debate. Clearly the need for nurses to have education in caring for people with mental health issues is essential. The Fourth Edition of Neeb's Fundamentals of Mental Health Nursing brings new authors who have expanded on the foundations that Kathy Neeb created so successfully in the rst three editions. The new authors bring broad experience in psychiatric nursing, education, and clinical practice. New chapters in this Fourth Edition include postpartum issues as well as separate chapters on depressive and bipolar disorders. We have added more features to enhance the concepts and make them more meaningful and current. Chapters 1 to 9 provide the basics of mental health nursing concepts, with an emphasis on communication. Chapters 10 to 22 are \"clinical\" chapters in that they cover specific diagnoses and/or populations. Many of the chapters include the following new or enhanced key features: Neeb's Tip will give a \"clinical pearl\" that succinctly describes a key take-away from the chapter. Critical Thinking Questions are expanded and interspersed in the chapters to empha- size a concept and challenge the student to apply the concept just covered. Many of these include case-based scenarios. Toolbox provides additional resources for students who want more information. These can be further explored on the book's Web site. Pharmacology Corner in Chapters 10 to 20 and 22 covers important current informa- tion about medications used for the spe- cic population that will pertain to the LVN/LPN scope of practice. Clinical Activities are suggestions for the student to utilize when caring for patients with a particular disorder. Classroom Activities include suggestions for projects or actions that students and faculty can use in the classroom to enhance learning. Case Studies are in-depth, with questions to help the student apply knowledge learned in the chapter. Multiple Choice Questions\u2014At least 10 questions are provided at the end of the chapters, with the answers/rationales in Appendix A. Additional NCLEX questions are on the book's Web site. Sample Care Plans are provided in the clinical chapters. Appendix E, which is new, matches com- mon behaviors with nursing diagnoses. v Preface2993_FM_i-xvi 14/01/14 5:31 PM Page vInternet-based enhancements include pod- casts, updated references, and other resources such as drug monographs and Neeb's blog. Neeb's blog will provide an opportunity for the student to reflect on learning and experi- ences that can be shared with others. For the instructor, this Fourth Edition provides access to PowerPoint presentations, test bank questions, and other expanded features. This edition coincides with the publica- tion of the DSM-5, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders by the American Psychiatric Association that was published in 2013. The terminology used throughout this edition reflect the changes in this major psychiatric reference. Although theLVN/LPN student will not be using the Manual routinely, a familiarity with the terminology that is used by other health-care professionals is essential. The chapter titles reflect the new terminology where changes have been made. We, as practitioners and educators in the field of mental health, have seen the impact of mental health issues on our patients and society. We hope that the students who utilize this book will gain a new perspective that includes up-to-date knowledge as well as empathy for the suffering these disorders can cause. We hope this book will con- tribute to knowledgeable and compassion- ate , MSN, RN, CNOR Faculty of Nursing Isabella Graham Hart School of Practical Nursing Rochester, New York RENE\u00c9 T.

People have nurses to thank for cooking, cleaning, and ministering to those who fought battles. Long before people knew what aerobic or anaerobic microorganisms were, nurses knew when to open or close the windows. Nurses helped women give birth to their young and nursed the babies when mothers were unable to or when mothers died during or shortly after giving birth. The rst flight attendants were nurses. For centuries, nurses have gone about the business of caring for people, but they have not always done that quietly. Whowere the nurses who took the risks? Who were the ones who spoke out on behalf of the patient and the profession? In times when nursing was considered only \"women's work,\" and when women were not politically active, the major trailblazers were female. Florence Nightingale Florence Nightingale (1820-1910) (Fig. 1-1). has been called the founder of nursing. Her story and her contributions are numerous enough to ll many volumes. She was born of wealth and was highly educated. When she was very young, she realized she wanted to be a nurse, which did not please her parents. Conditions in hospitals were poor, and her 3CHAPTER1 History of Mental Health Nursing Learning Objectives 1.Identify the major trailblazers to mental health nursing. 2.Know the basic tenets or theories of the contributors to mental health nursing. 3.Dene three types of treatment facilities. 4.Identify three breakthroughs that advanced mental health nursing. 5.Identify the major laws and provisions of each that influenced mental health nursing.Key Terms American Nurses Association (ANA) Asylum Deinstitutionalization Free-standing treatment centers National Association for Practical Nurse Education and Service (NAPNES) National Federation of Licensed Practical Nurses (NFLPN) National League for Nursing (NLN) Nurse Practice Act Psychotropic Standards of care 2993_Ch01_001-014 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 3parents wanted her to pursue a life as wife, mother, and society woman. Florence worked hard to educate herself in the art and science of nursing. Her mission to help the British soldiers in the Crimean War earned her respect around the world as a nurse and administrator. This was no easy task because many of the soldiers at the Barrack Hospital at Scutari resented her intelligence and did what they could to undermine her work. The relationship between sanitary con - ditions and healing became known and accepted due to her observations and dili- gence. Within 6 months of her arrival in Scutari, the mortality rate dropped from 42.7% to 2.2% (Donahue, 1985, p. 244). She insisted on proper lighting, diet, clean- liness, and recreation. She understood that the mind and body work together and that cleanliness, the predecessor to today's sterile techniques, is a major barrier to infec- tion and promotes healing. She carefully observed and documented changes in the conditions of the soldiers, which led to her adulation as \"The Lady with the Lamp\" (from the poem \"Santa Filomena\" by H. W. Longfellow). Santa Filomena by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Whene'er a noble deed is wrought, Whene'er is spoken a noble thought, Our hearts, in glad surprise, To higher levels rise.The tidal wave of deeper souls Into our inmost being rolls, And lifts us unawares Out of all meaner cares. Honour to those whose words or deeds Thus help us in our daily needs, And by their overflow Raise us from what is low! Thus thought I, as by night I read Of the great army of the dead, The trenches cold and damp, The starved and frozen camp, The wounded from the battle-plain, In dreary hospitals of pain, The cheerless corridors, The cold and stony floors. Lo! in that house of misery A lady with a lamp I see Pass through the glimmering gloom, And flit from room to room. And slow, as in a dream of bliss, The speechless suerer turns to kiss Her shadow, as it falls Upon the darkening walls. As if a door in heaven should be Opened and then closed suddenly, The vision came and went, The light shone and was spent. On England's annals, through the long Hereafter of her speech and song, That light its rays shall cast From portals of the past. A Lady with a Lamp shall stand In the great history of the land, A noble type of good, Heroic womanhood. Nor even shall be wanting here The palm, the lily, and the spear, The symbols that of yore Saint Filomena bore. She was a crusader for the improvement of care and conditions in the military and civil- ian hospitals in Britain. Among her books are Notes on Hospitals (1859), which deals with the relationship of sanitary techniques to medical facilities; Notes on Nursing (1859), which was the most respected nursing text- book of the day; and Notes on Matters Aect- ing the Health, Eciency and Hospital Administration of the British Army (1857) (Donahue, 1985, p. 248).4 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Figure 1-1 Florence Nightingale at work during the Crimean War. 2993_Ch01_001-014 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 4The first formal nurses' training pro- gram, the Nightingale School for Nurses, opened in 1860. The goals of the school were to train nurses to work in hospitals, to work with the poor, and to teach. This meant that students cared for people in their homes, an idea that is still gaining in popularity and professional opportunity for nurses. Florence Nightingale died at the age of 90. Dorothea Dix Dorothea Dix (1802-1887) (Fig. 1-2) was a schoolteacher, not a nurse. She believed that people did not need to live in suering and that society at large had a responsibility to aid those less fortunate. Her primary focus was the care of prisoners and the mentally ill. She lobbied in the United States and Canada for the improvement of standards of care for the mentally ill and even suggested that the gov- ernments take an active role in providing help with nances, food, shelter, and other areas of need. She learned that many criminals were also mentally ill, a theory that is borne out in studies today. Because of the eorts of Dorothea Dix, 32 states developed asylumsor \"psychiatric hospitals\" to care for the men- tally ill. There is a monument to her that sym- bolized her eorts on the Women's Heritage T rail in Boston. Linda Richards While Dorothea Dix was working for politi- cal help in mental health, a nurse named Linda Richards (1841-1930) (Fig. 1-3) was pushing to upgrade nursing education. She was the rst American-trained nurse, and in 1882 she opened the Boston City Hospital T raining School for Nurses to teach the specialty of caring for the mentally ill. By 1890, more than 30 asylums in the United States had developed schools for nurses. Linda Richards was among the rst nurses to teach and work seriously with planning and developing nursing care for patients. In cooperation with the American Nurses Association (ANA) and the National League for Nursing (NLN), she was instrumental in developing textbooks specically for nurses that had stated objectives for outcomes of nursing education and patient care. CHAPTER 1|History of Mental Health Nursing 5 Figure 1-2 Dorothea Dix. Linda Richards America's First Trained Nurse Potsdam, 1841 Figure 1-3 Linda Richards.2993_Ch01_001-014 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 5Harriet Bailey The rst textbook focusing on psychiatric nursing was written in 1920 by Harriet Bailey. It included guidelines for nurses who provided care for those with a mental illness. Bailey un- derstood that nurses caring for these patients needed proper training. After she published her book, the NLN began requiring all stu- dent nurses have a clinical rotation in a psy- chiatric setting (Videback, 2013). Effie Jane Taylor Ee Jane Taylor (Fig. 1-4) initiated the rst psy- chiatric program of study for nurses, in 1913. She is also well known for her development and implementation of patient-centered care, put- ting emphasis on the emotional and intellec- tual life of the patient. Ee Taylor received a diploma in nursing from Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, later to become a nursing professor in psychiatry (American Association for the History of Nursing, Inc., 2007). Mary Mahoney Mary Mahoney (1845-1926) (Fig. 1-5) is considered to be America's rst African- American professional nurse. Her contribu- tions were primarily in home care and in the promotion of the acceptance of African Americans in the eld of nursing. An award in her name is presented at the annual ANA convention to a person who has worked to promote equal opportunity for minorities in nursing. During her career, it was necessary to open separate schools of nursing for African American students because they were banned from the schools for white students. T wo of these separate schools were Spelman Seminary (currently known as Spelman College) in Georgia and T uskegee Institute in Alabama. Hildegard Peplau Dr. Hildegard Peplau (1909-1999) (Fig. 1-6) was a nurse ahead of her time. She believed that nursing is multifaceted and that the nurse must educate and promote wellness as well as deliver care to the ill. In her book, Interpersonal Relations in Nursing (1952), Dr. Peplau brought together some interper- sonal theories from psychiatry and melded them with theories of nursing and communi- cation. She believed that nurses work in society\u2014not merely in a hospital or clinic\u2014 and that they need to use every opportunity to educate the public and follow role models in physical and mental health. Peplau saw the nurse as: 1.Resource person. Provides information. 2.Counselor. Helps patients to explore their thoughts and feelings.6 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Figure 1-4 Ee Jane Taylor. (From Yale Univer- sity, Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library.) Figure Mahoney.2993_Ch01_001-014 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 63.Surrogate. By role-playing or other means helps the patient to explore and identify feelings from the past. 4.Technical support. Coordinates professional services (Peplau, 1952). In addition to this, she believed in build- ing a collaborative therapeutic relationship between the nurse and the patient. In her book she cites four stages of this relationship (Peplau, 1952): 1.Orientation. Patient feels a need and a will to seek out help. 2.Identication. Expectations and perceptions about the nurse-patient relationship are identied. 3.Exploration. Patient will begin to show motivation in the problem-solving process, but some testing behaviors may be seen; patient may have a need to \"test\" the nurse's commitment to his/her indi- vidual situation. 4.Resolution. Focus is on the patient's developing self-responsibility and showing personal growth. In 1954, the rst graduate-level nursing program was developed by Dr. Peplau at Rutgers University to provide training for clin- ical nurse specialists for psychiatric nursing. Hattie Bessent In the early 1980s, the National Institute of Mental Health granted money to be used for the education and research of minority nurses who were choosing to upgrade to master's and doctorate levels of practice. Hattie Bessent (Fig. 1-7) is credited with the development and directorship of that program. In 2008 the ANA presented Dr. Bessent with its Hall of Fame Award. CHAPTER 1|History of Mental Health Nursing 7 Figure 1-6 Hildegard Peplau. Critical Thinking Question The \"trailblazers\" were risk takers. One of the professional responsibilities of nursing is to try to give something back to our profession. How will you, as an individual, become a trailblazer? What direction should nursing as a whole take to strengthen the profession? What criteria should be important when deciding what level of preparation in nursing should allow the nurse to be a specialist in mental health? Classroom Activity Have students (and colleagues) research trail- blazers in nursing and, on an assigned day, come to class with a prop and a brief explana- tion of the trailblazers and their contributions to nursing. Figure 1-7 Hattie Bessent.2993_Ch01_001-014 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 7 The Facilities People who have mental illnesses are every- where; popular statistics say that about one in every three Americans will experience some form of mental illness at some point in life. The trailblazers in nursing realized that men- tal illness is dierent from medical-surgical disorders. They understood that each person's mind is truly unique and therefore nurses need information and training specic to those illnesses. To help meet those needs, they took action to improve the quality of care for those patients. This was not enough, however, and it became evident that persons with mod- erate to severe mental disorders were often better served through care in special facilities. Asylums These special facilities were called asylums, which Webster Online, in part, denes as \"1: a place of refuge; 2: protection given to criminals and debtors; 3: an institution for the care of the needy or sick and especially of the insane.\" Patients in asylums were fre- quently treated less than humanely. Custodial care was provided, but patients were often heavily medicated. Nutritional and physical care was minimal, and often these patients were volunteered for various forms of experi- mentation and research. One of the largest asylums in the United States was known as ByBerry, later to be re- named Philadelphia State Hospital (Fig. 1-8). This facility reportedly provided inhumane treatment to its patients. With the onset of deinstitutionalization and due to the poor conditions, this facility saw its last patient in 1990. Hospitals As treatment facilities evolved, the term asylum and the connotations associated with it became unpopular. In 1753, Pennsylvania Hospital established a facility to treat those with mental disorders. The hospital was established by Dr. Thomas Bond and Benjamin Franklin. Until the Community Mental Health Act of 1963 was passed, housing of this clientele was primarily han- dled by individual state hospital systems. Today, hospitals handle patients with psychological needs according to the size of the hospital and its resources. To comply with regulations surrounding mental health issues, in smaller communities these patients may be seen in a hospital emergency room and then referred to other clinics or hospitals. Commu- nities large enough to support such programs may provide in-house mental health treat- ment as well as outpatient treatment and aftercare. Metropolitan areas commonly pro- vide treatment via several options, including hospitals and free-standing treatment centers. Free-Standing Facilities Free-standing treatment centers may be called detoxication (detox) centers, crisis centers, or similar names. Most people are familiar with the Betty Ford Center. Many free-standing treatment centers provide care ranging from crisis-only to more traditional 21-day stays. As with the Betty Ford Center, a stay can last up to 120 days. This, too, depends largely on the size and needs of the individual community. More discussion on the types of treatment facilities occurs in the section on The Laws. The Breakthroughs It was not until 1937 that formal clinical rotations in mental health began for nurses. Today, these rotations are required for stu- dents in nursing programs, but students in practical or vocational nursing are usually8 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Figure 1-8 ByBerry, later to be renamed Philadelphia State Hospital. 2993_Ch01_001-014 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 8exposed to mental health theory and very short observational experiences. In 1955, theory relating to mental health nursing became a requirement for licensure for all nurses. Throughout the 1800s and early 1900s, progress was made in developing humane, effective treatment of mental illnesses. With the best knowledge available to them as a profession, nurses were forward thinkers in providing specialized care to people unfortunate enough to have illnesses that were somehow different from the tubercu- losis, smallpox, and influenza that filled hospitals. There was one major difference, however: Medicines existed to help in treat- ing those diseases. At that time, no one had been able to find pharmacologic help for people with emotional, behavioral, or phys- ical brain disorders. That would change in the 1950s. Psychotropic Medications In the early 1950s, chemists were experi- menting with combinations of chemicals and their eects on people. In 1955, a group of psychotropic medications called pheno - thiazines was discovered to have the eect of calming and tranquilizing people. One well known phenothiazine is Thorazine. What a world of possibility this opened for people living with and caring for those with mental disorders! Suddenly it was possible to control behavior to a degree, and patients were able to function more independently . Other forms of therapy became more eective because patients were able to focus dierently. Some patients improved so dramatically that it was no longer necessary for them to remain hospitalized and dependent on others. Between the mid-1950s and the mid-1970s, the number of patients hospitalized with mental illnesses in the United States was cut approximately in half, mainly because of the use of psychotropic drugs. Deinstitutionalization The use of phenothiazines (see Chapter 8) became so eective that state hospitals and other facilities dedicated to the care and treatment of people with mental illness sawa large decline in population. It became costly to run these large buildings and con- tinue to employ sta. The combination of these eects, as well as new laws pertaining to the care of the mentally ill, resulted in a movement called deinstitutionalization. People who had formerly required long hospital stays were now able to leave the institutions and return to their communities. Once discharged, some went to group homes and others to their own homes. Deinstitu- tionalization was and still is a controversial issue, but it was a huge step in returning a sense of worth, ability, and independence to those who had been dependent on others for their care for so long.CHAPTER 1|History of Mental Health Nursing 9 Critical Thinking Question The laws have said that people who have mental illnesses should be treated using the least restric- tive alternative. Deinstitutionalization allows these people to live among us in the community. Consider the following scenario: Your city has just purchased the house next door to you, and the plan is to develop this into a halfway house for women who have been child abusers. You are the parent of a 3-year-old and you are also a mental health nurse. What would you do? What are your thoughts and feelings about this situation? Nursing Organizations and Recommendations A natural progression from the break- throughs that were happening in nursing was the development of organizations for nurses. The American Nurses Association (ANA) is recognized as an organization for registered nurses (RNs). One of its goals is to promote standardization of nursing prac- tice in the United States. It also promotes the certification of nurses who meet specific criteria. The concept of psychiatric nurse specialists, clinicians, or advanced practice nurses is a result of the work of the ANA. The American Psychiatric Nurses Associa- tion provides leadership in recommending standards of care for nurses who care for people with mental illness. This organization invites nurses who are RN-prepared. Further information can be obtained at its Web site, www.apna.org.2993_Ch01_001-014 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 9The National League for Nursing evolved from the National League for Nursing Educa- tion and became known as the NLN in 1952. NLN is the accrediting agency for many schools of nursing across the United States with its specic focus on nursing education. Every state has adopted its own code or set of rules by which all nurses are expected to perform. This is called the Nurse Practice Act and is based on federal guidelines that have been adapted to the needs of the individual state. The Nurse Practice Act is discussed in more detail in Chapter 3. Sigma Theta Tau is an honor society for nurses who have shown special talents in research or leadership. It is open to baccalaureate-degree nursing students, grad- uate students in nursing, and leaders in the nursing community. Specic to the licensed practical/vocational nurse are two organizations: National Feder- ation of Licensed Practical Nurses (NFLPN) and National Association for Practical Nurse Education and Service (NAPNES). NFLPN welcomes licensed practical nurses (LPNs), licensed vocational nurses (LVNs), and practical/ vocational nursing (PN) students in the United States. In September 1991, a new category of aliate membership was estab- lished to allow those who have an interest in the work of NFLPN but who are neither LPNs nor PN students to join. The NFLPN has a published set of Nursing Practice Stan- dards for the LPN (Appendix D). The standards can be found online at www.nflpn.org/ practice-standards4web.pdf. NAPNES was founded by practical nurse educators in 1941 and identies itself as the world's oldest nursing organization dedicated exclusively to the promotion of quality nurs- ing service through the practice of LPNs and LVNs. NAPNES is a multidisciplinary organization of individuals, facilities, and schools that advocate for professional prac- tice of practical and vocational nursing.

Among its objectives is to encourage men of all ages to become nurses and join together with all nurses in strengthening and humanizing health care.

There were ethical con- siderations that had not surfaced in earlier years. Psychotropic and (also known as psy- choactive) medications were beneting many patients but had their own problems as well; side eects were not always pleasant. More drugs were being developed, and more ques- tions arose: How much is too much to give people? Do we keep them completely se- dated? People were asking which was worse: the illness or the medication? People are still asking that question. Other concerns have arisen, for example, how some psychotropic drugs are associated with diabetic mellitus. Nonetheless, it was necessary to begin reg- ulating the health-care industry a bit more. A series of laws governing various aspects of care for persons with mental illnesses were passed. The laws have changed somewhat and have been renamed in some cases, but the collective intention is to provide funding, treatment, and ethical care for this segment of society.CHAPTER 1|History of Mental Health Nursing 11 Tool Box |Nursing Organizations ANA: American Nurses Association: www.nursingworld.org/ APNA: of Licensed Practical Nurses: www.nflpn.org/ NAPNES: National Association for Practical Nurse Education and Services: www.napnes.org/ NCEMNA: National Coalition of Ethnic Minority Nurse Associations: www.ncemna.org/ AAPINA: Asian American / Pacic Islander Nurses Association, Inc.: www.aapina.org/ NANAINA: National Alaska Native American Indian Nurses Association: www.geronurseonline.org/ (see partner organizations) NAHN: National Association of www.nahnnet.org/ NBNA: National Black Association of America: www.mypnaa.org/ AAMN: American Assembly for Men in Nursing: http://aamn.org/Critical Thinking Question Your employer has announced that your com- pany is changing its medical insurance policy.

THE LAWS Over the years many changes and advance- ments have been made in medicine andHill-Burton Act In 1946, Senators Lister Hill and Harold Burton collaborated and created the Hill-Burton Act, a federal law. It was the first major law to address mental illness. It pro- vided money to build psychiatric units in hospitals. Today, the many soldiers returning from the Afghanistan war who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder know they will not be turned away because of financial difficulties, as the Hill-Burton Act protects those who have no insurance coverage.and dissemination of information about men's health issues, men in nursing, and nursing knowledge at the local and national levels.2993_Ch01_001-014 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 11National Mental Health Act of 1946 The National Mental Health Act of 1946 was a result of the rst Congress held after World War II. It provided money for nursing and several other disciplines for training and research in areas pertaining to improving treatment for the mentally ill. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) was established as part of the National Mental Health Act of 1946. The NIMH continu- ously updates the public on mental health issues. Since 1999, NIMH has been research- ing autism. The agency also started the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Service Members (Army Starrs). The Army Starrs will look at the many factors that will be facing those who had to encounter battle. Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963 The Community Mental Health Centers Act resulted from President John F . Kennedy's concern for the treatment of the mentally ill. Its main purpose was to provide a full set of services to the people living in a particular community. These services were to include inpatient care, outpatient care, emergency care, and education. This was to be a national eort, funded federally at rst. The goal was for the centers to generate enough services so that, eventually, the community could support it nancially. In 1981, the bill was amended in Congress. Called the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA), it allows money to be allocated dierently. There is currently less money avail- able in the federal budget, and that money can be withheld at any time. Unfortunately, with the turmoil in the insurance and health-care delivery systems today, mental health benets are often among the rst services to be cut back or eliminated. Patient Bill of Rights In 1980, the image of the patient was chang- ing. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s was giving way to the provision of rights for all groups of people. Patients were beginningto be identied as \"clients\" who purchase services from health-care providers. Persons of very young or very old age or persons with certain physical, intellectual, or communica- tion diculties became politically recognized as \"vulnerable.\" The outcome was the devel- opment of the Patient Bill of Rights, which is discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.12 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Tool Box |Community Mental Health Act 1963 www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/ dmh/about-the-department-of-mental- health.html Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-103hr 2264enr/pdf/BILLS-103hr2264enr.pdf Clinical Activity Discussion Questions: In clinical post-conference, discuss your answers to these questions. 1.

It has evolved from very rudimentary skills before the time of Florence Nightingale to the specialty area of nursing today. 2.Patients with mental illness are treated in many dierent types of facilities, depend- ing on the diagnosis and the availability of care in the particular community. 3.The 1950s were important years in the mental health eld. The rst psychotropic medications were developed, making it possible for people to return to their homes and communities (deinstitutional- ization). These medications also allowed other treatment forms to be used more eectively.2993_Ch01_001-014 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 12REFERENCES American Association for the History of Nursing, Inc, (2007).

Every- thing people do or say has a message and a meaning. Sometimes, the words and the actions send dierent mean- ings to dierent people. For example: Sally and Jim meet for shift report in the morning. Sally's eyes are red and swollen, and she is unusually quiet. Jim asks her if something is wrong, and she responds, \"No, everything is just ne.\" Jim has observed some changes in Sally's behavior and appearance. Sally has verbally communicated that nothing iswrong. What is really being communicated here? People of dierent cultures communicate dierently. Men and women communicate dierently. Hearing-impaired people com- municate dierently from people who are not hearing impaired. A hearing-impaired person may use a hearing aid, technology, and ampliers. People in the medical profes- sions communicate dierently from people in business professions by using terminology which relates to the medical profession rather 15CHAPTER2 Basics of Communication Learning Objectives 1.Identify three components needed to communicate. 2.Dierentiate between eective and ineective communication. 3.Identify six types of communication. 4.Identify ve challenges to communication. 5.Identify common blocks to therapeutic communication. 6.Identify common techniques of therapeutic communication. 7.Identify ve adaptive communication techniques. 8.Dene key terms.Key Terms Aggressive communication Aphasia Assertive communication Communication Communication block Hearing-impaired Ineective communication Laryngectomy Message Neurolinguistic programming (NLP) Nonverbal communication Receiver Sender Social communication Therapeutic communication Verbal communication Visually impaired 2993_Ch02_015-032 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 15than to the business world. People commu- nicate all the time in everything they do. Communication is an ongoing process of sending and receiving messages. Communication Theory Sender, Receiver, and Interpretation of Message One of the challenging parts of communi- cating with others is that the process re- quires three parts: a sender, a message, and a receiver (Fig. 2-1). That means the sender is only partially responsible for the communication. Sally cannot totally control Jim's interpretation of her message. Sally is the sender, sending a message to Jim, the receiver, in the above scenario. As it turns out, Sally is a victim of severe allergies. She was visiting her friend who has cats. Sally is very allergic to them, and the redness and swelling were symptoms of her allergic response. She simply did not wish to burden Jim with her problem during shift report, so she opted to respond by telling him everything was \"just ne.\" Types of Communication Verbal and Written Communication Verbal communication is the process of exchanging information by the spoken or written word. It is, therefore, the subjective part of the process. In the example given earlier, Sally's reply that \"everything is just ne\" is an example of verbal communication. The expertise a nurse develops in the areas of written and verbal communication is largely responsible for the credibility of that nurse. Critical thinking is essential to understanding Sally's reply.16 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Sends Message to Sender Receiver Figure 2-1 A basic flow of communication. Classroom Activity What was your initial interpretation of what Sally was communicating? On what did you base your interpretation? What \"spoke\" louder to you: Sally's words or her actions and appearance? What is the danger in making this assumption about Sally's message? It is very important for the sender and receiver to double-check the message. In nursing, this is crucial because nurses use their own profes- sional \"language\"; when dealing with the health and safety of patients, nurses need to be very sure that there are not \"mixed\" or \"missed\" messages. In a discussion class on the topic of words and gestures and what they mean, one African American female student spoke up. She shared with the class that \"gals\" in her world was a demeaning term relating to the degrading role of the African American woman in history. It is important to know that the mean- ing of a word can change from one generation to the next. In the 1950s and 1960s, being part of the \"guys\" or the \"gals\" was a good thing. It demonstrated acceptance and belonging to one's social group.Neeb's Tip Nonverbal Communication Nonverbal communication is more subtle, but it is the greatest influence on commu- nication. It consists of people's actions, tone of voice, the way they use their body, and their facial expressions. It is more subjective since nonverbal communication can be interpreted many different ways by the re- ceiver (Fig. 2-2). In the example above, Sally's body language communicated that she was not \"fine.\" This points out the need to be careful with hand gestures that can be misinter- preted. Many people use hand gestures when speaking. People do it often without thinking.2993_Ch02_015-032 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 16People must be ready to learn from each other every day. Nurses need to be prepared to make known those terms or gestures that are uncomfortable for them and their patients. They must make a conscious eort not to use those words when in the company of those they may oend (Box 2-1.) Aggressive and Assertive Communication The terms aggressive and assertive are some- times used interchangeably in American cul- ture, but they have very dierent meanings. Aggressive Communication Aggressive communication is communica- tion that is not self-responsible. Aggressive statements most often begin with the word \"you.\" Aggressive communication, like aggres- sive behavior, is meant to harm another per- son. It is a form of the defense mechanism projection, or blaming, and it attempts to put the responsibility for the interaction on the other person. Aggressive communication is also highly subjective as demonstrated in nonverbal communication. EXAMPLE \"You make me so angry when you don't help with the housework!\"CHAPTER 2|Basics of Communication 17 Cultural Considerations Identify the diverse cultures and generations in your community and dene a gesture that you use that means something dierent to others.Figure 2-2 Nonverbal communication is estimated to be 70% of the message we send. The old saying is true: A picture is worth a thousand words! However, making the \"OK\" sign with one's ngers, which is normally a sign of encour- agement, agreement, or congratulations, is a vulgarity in some cultures. lBox 2-1 Examples of Communication With Cultural Implications Words that are seemingly harmless to some people can be very hurtful to others. People do not usually know that until they take the time to ask! These are the examples of commu - nication that may have different cultural implications. How many more can your class identify? Eye contact with strangers or those in perceived positions of power or respect is not considered appropriate among some populations. Hand gestures may communicate dierent meanings to dierent groups of people. Slang terms may be inappropriate or oensive, or may exclude people who do not understand the meaning of the word. Gender-reference terms such as \"you guys\" when the group is mixed or not male. Terms such as \"master\" and \"slave\" frequently used in computer-related issues may oend African American people and others. African American women displayed in subservient roles. Distortion or omission of important developments in the lives of African Americans. Pictures or photographs that do not portray accurate skin tones, hair texture, and physical features of certain ethnic groups.2993_Ch02_015-032 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 17Assertive Communication Assertive communication, on the other hand, is self-responsible. Assertive state- ments begin with the word \"I.\" They deal with thoughts and feelings, and they deal with honesty. EXAMPLE \"I feel angry when you don't help with the housework!\" Assertive behavior and communication are also techniques of personal empowerment. People choose to think or feel a certain way; others do not have the power to make people think or feel anything they do not choose to think or feel. To be able to say \"I think\" or \"I feel\" keeps people in control of their emo- tions, yet it allows honest, open expression of the feelings they have as a result of someone else's behavior. Still, the feelings and thoughts belong to the person choosing them, not to anyone else.Therapeutic Communication Intherapeutic communication, the nurse understands that in order to acquire cer- tain desired information from the patient, unique techniques of communication will have to be instituted. They will be individu- alized to the patient as well as to the mental health disorder. Therapeutic communication is a language of its own. It requires testing new methods of communicating and new ways of listening. Therapeutic communica- tion is purposeful: Nurses are trying to de- termine the patient's needs. Sometimes, for various reasons, the patient is not comfort- able sharing his or her needs and concerns. At those times, it is up to the nurse to try to uncover the problem by using two tools: techniques of therapeutic communication and \"active\" or \"purposeful\" listening (or \"listening between the lines\"). The tech- niques and blocks to them will be discussed at the end of this chapter. In addition it is essential to identify the components of any mental health disorder to provide effective therapeutic communication. Neurolinguistic Programming Neurolinguistic programming (NLP) is a form of communication developed prima- rily by Milton Erickson, a hypnotherapist; John Grinder, a psychologist and linguistics professor; and Richard Bandler, a mathe- matician and editor (Grinder & Bandler, 1981). It is a way of framing statements and questions while attempting effective com- munication. One of the theory's tenets, not unlike other communication theories, is that humans cannot fail to communicate. The theory builds on the idea that humans tend to communicate in basically three ways: hearing, seeing, and touching. Choice of wording can make a difference in how the words a nurse says to a patient are actually \"heard\" by that patient, as communication must have a sender and a receiver. NLP is one method being taught to health-care providers to assist in the successful comple- tion of the communication loop. NLP is not hypnosis; it is a form of com- munication. NLP can be used in conjunction18 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Social Communication People usually alter their style of communi- cating according to who is receiving the message. Social communication is the day- to-day interaction people have with personal acquaintances. For example, teenagers usually communicate with their peer group in a dierent manner than they do with their par- ents. So, too, do nurses communicate dier- ently with their patients than they do with their friends or family. Nurses may use slang or \"street language,\" and they may be less literal and purposeful in their social interactions. Quite simply, social interaction has a dierent purpose than a nurse's professional communication.Critical Thinking Question Write one feeling statement and one thinking statement for the following situation: A co-worker who is a BSN-prepared nurse is routinely coming late to work and overstaying breaks, causing patients to have unsafe care and you to have extra work. You speak to your nurse manager, who appears to ignore your concerns, so you approach the co-worker.2993_Ch02_015-032 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 18with hypnosis and other treatment modali- ties. In most states, hypnosis can only be per- formed legally by professionals specially trained and licensed to do so. Further explanation and some simple examples of NLP phrasing are provided in Chapter 9.while having laryngitis; signing a check while your arm is in a cast; or reading traffic signs after your eyes were dilated. These are uncomfortable situations, but for the most part, they are temporary. What about pa- tients and coworkers for whom disabilities are permanent? People Who Are Hearing- Impaired The nurse must be very patient when com- municating with people who are hearing- impaired. A nurse needs to be aware that the hearing-impaired person's frustration is even greater than that of the nurse in trying to communicate. T ry to establish a trusting, team-approach relationship with hearing- impaired patients. Let them know you will try whatever it takes for you to be able to under- stand each other. Find out what has worked for that person in the past. Not all hearing-impaired people use sign language; some use lipreading. However, lipreading may be inaccurate and could lead to incorrect communication. Sometimes writ- ing a note or providing the patient with a journal is an eective way to communicate with a person who is deaf or hard of hearing. Keep in mind the key factor is communica- tion and not the patient's grammatical or spelling abilities. People Who Are Visually Impaired When a person is visually impaired, the nonverbal part of communication can be a challenge. Nursing is a highly affective art, so certain nonverbal cues, such as tone of voice, body position, and facial expressions, \"speak\" most strongly to patients. How does a sightless person or someone who is severely impaired visually interpret these nonverbal cues? Nurses must learn to become detail- oriented storytellers. It is important to learn to describe to a visually impaired patient the location of the call signal, what the call signal sounds like, what the people in the hall are laughing at, why the voices suddenly switch to a whisper when another person enters theCHAPTER 2|Basics of Communication 19 Critical Thinking Question Turn the following aggressive statements into assertive statements. \"You make me so angry when you stop at the bar before you come home.\" \"You always take the 'easy' assignment, and that's not fair.\" \"Mark always gets the days o he asks for; why can't I?\" Challenges to Communication Communicating is something that humans often take for granted\u2014until they no longer can do it: for example, answering the telephone Clinical Activity Community Resources Worksheet Contact a community agency in your commu- nity.

Similarly, sightless people cannot see a wave of the hand or see when someone leaves or enters a room; these events must be verbalized. Patient teaching takes on a new dimen- sion because it involves physically moving, touching, or verbally explaining in much more detail than usual. Learning to eat can be difficult for a newly sightless person. Usually, the teaching involves relating the food position to the numbers on a clock face. Sightless patients need to rely on their other senses to compensate for the eyes they cannot use. Sometimes individuals have more than one need to be considered when the nurse com- municates with them. For example, some people are both hearing impaired and visually impaired. When communicating with these individuals, a nurse needs to be creative. Investigate methods that have worked for this person in the past and explore methods such as a conversation board or printing the message on the person's palm. As emphasized in any nursing fundamen- tals class, when beginning and exiting the patient's room, the nurse needs: to identify him-/herself, explain what procedure is being performed, make sure the patient is safe, and identify when leaving. People Who Have Laryngectomies Some people live with partial or total laryngectomy \u2014the removal of their larynx(\"voice box\"). Imagine what it would be like to be able to speak one day and have no voice at all the next. The larynx is a body part that is very much taken for granted. How do such people answer the phone? How does a person order a pizza? How would such people express their emotions? Call for help? People With Language Differences Today's society is global. Even though English is the predominant language in the United States, it may not be the primary language for many of the people nurses work with and care for. As a nurse, you may nd yourself in an area where you are the one who does not speak the primary language. How will you communicate? How will you ensure safe care of your patients? If the physician with a thick accent gives a verbal order, how will you know you have heard it correctly? What about those people who say they are speaking English, but you are not able to understand them? It can be very embarrassing and potentially insulting for all parties involved. Techniques for ensur- ing understanding are discussed at the end of this chapter. People Who Have Aphasic/ Dysphasic Disorders A person with aphasia/dysphasia has either no speech or great difficulty with speech. The amount of speech a patient possesses is related to many things, such as age, cause of difficulty, and severity of involvement. There are different types of aphasia (Table 2-1). 20 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing lTable 2-1 Types of Aphasia Types of Aphasia Description Expressive Diculty expressing himself or herself in written or verbal forms of communication Receptive Diculty interpreting or understanding written or verbal forms of communication. Global Combination of receptive and expressive forms of aphasia2993_Ch02_015-032 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 20It is up to the physician and the speech therapist to determine the cause and extent of involvement, but the nurse will be part of the plan of care. This will be a very individualized type of communication skill. Patients may know that the nurse has asked them for the comb; they may think they are handing the nurse the comb, but they actually hand the nurse the coee cup. A patient may try to read aloud a passage from a book, but what comes out of the patient's mouth may be a long line of obscenities. The patient would be very embarrassed if he or she knew what was said. The nurse must be very understanding and willing to try repeatedly to have correct communication with persons with various forms of aphasia. Nurses also must remember that any \"nasty words\" are not to be taken personally; chances are very good that those words are really a sincere attempt by the patient to say, \"Thank you, nurse.\" See the section headed \"Adaptive Communication Techniques.\"Before reviewing therapeutic communi- cation techniques, ineffective ones will be reviewed. There is an old saying that \"the road to defeat is paved with good inten- tions.\" Sometimes, nurses' good intentions get them in trouble with their communica- tion skills. Nurses can sometimes uninten- tionally set themselves up for ineffective communication. The following is a list of ways nurses \"block,\" or impede, helpful interactions with patients: 1.False reassurance/social clich\u00e9s. These are phrases nurses use in an eort to sound supportive. In social communication they sound friendly, but in a therapeutic relationship they invalidate the patient's concerns. EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"Don't worry! Tells patient his or her Everything will concerns are not valid be just ne.\" May jeopardize patient's trust in nurse 2.Minimizing/belittling. These, too, are used socially to try to relieve the ten- sions of others. There is security in numbers, and sharing that many people are experiencing the same thing as the individual is somehow supposed to make the problem seem lighter. In therapeutic use, the implications are different. EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"We have all Implies that the patient's felt that way feelings are not special. sometimes.\" 3.\"Why?\" This simple word needs to be eliminated in therapeutic interactions. \"Why\" connotes disapproval or dis- pleasure. \"Why ask why?\" is a good question for the health-care provider to remember. The patient often does not know \"why\" and can end up feeling responsible for providing an answer anyway. The nurse often needs to know \"why,\" but there are other ways to ask that are less stress-producing for the patient.CHAPTER 2|Basics of Communication 21 Classroom Activity Contact a representative from Americans with Disabilities, your state's Services for the Blind, or any of your local agencies that serve populations with special communication needs. Invite some- one from one of these agencies to be a guest speaker. Clinical Activity In a clinical rotation, assign students (simulate if in the classroom) to care for a person with a com- munication challenge. Have the students describe how they altered their usual communication pat- terns to work with this individual. Therapeutic Communication It is possible to have a helping, therapeutic conversation with most people, but it takes some practice. These \"techniques\" need to be practiced in much the same way that one learns any other language: by hearing them, practicing them, and making them part of one's professional (and social) vocabulary.2993_Ch02_015-032 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 21EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"Why did you Patient feels obligated refuse your to answer something he breakfast?\" or she may not wish to answer or may not be able to answer Probes in an abrasive way 4.Advising. Alcoholics Anonymous some- times uses the statement, \"Don't 'should' on yourself.\" Nurses also must not \"should\" on their patients. This sets the stage for expectations that the patient may not be able to meet. It also sets up, in the patient's mind, some sort of value system that puts the nurse's value as the \"right\" one. It can sound very judgmental. EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"You should eat Places a value on the more.\" action \"If I were you, Gives the idea that the I would take nurse's values are the those pills so \"right\" ones I would feel Sounds parental better.\" 5.Agreeing or disagreeing. Socially, people agree or disagree for several reasons. Sometimes people are just expressing their opinion. Sometimes they are try- ing to make a favorable impression. Therapeutically, it is wise for nurses to avoid statements that express their own opinions or values. Even though some situations appear similar, there may be factors, which make them different. EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"You were wrong Places a \"right\" or about that.\" \"wrong\" on the action \"I think you're right.\" 6.Closed-ended questions. These are forms of questions that make it possible for a one- word \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. They discour- age the patient from giving full answers to the questions. Closed-ended questions are those that start with such phrases as22 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental and \"May I.\" not help to add please, as in \"Please, may I ask you a question?\" or \"Will you please take out the trash?\" This courtesy still leaves the possibility for the receiver to say \"yes\" or \"no.\" The please makes it sound more polite in social venues, but the same questions can be made assertive and therapeutic by stating or asking for what one wants (\"I need to ask you a question\" or \"Please take out the trash\"). The general rule for making an open-ended question from a closed-ended question is to simply drop o the rst one or two words. This can also be accomplished by adding words like how and what to the beginning of the question. Closed: \"Can I help you?\" Open: \"How can I help you?\" or \"What can I do to help you?\" EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"Can you tell me Allows a \"yes\" or \"no\" how you feel?\" answer \"Do you smoke?\" Discourages further \"Can I ask you a exploitation of the few questions?\" topic Discourages patient from giving information 7.Providing the answer with the question. This is a technique that television inter- viewers use frequently. The interviewee may say, \"The interviewer put words into my mouth.\" For instance, a ques- tion that answers itself is, \"Didn't you know that the committee would reject the proposal?\" Occasionally, the body language of the interviewer or the sender may influence the answer. A better way to ask this question is, \"What were your thoughts about how the committee might react?\" EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"Are you afraid?\" Combines a closed- \"Didn't the food ended question with a taste good?\" solution \"Do you miss Discourages patient your mom from providing his or today?\" her own answers2993_Ch02_015-032 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 22patient to determine the best way to help the patient help himself or herself. If the nurse can look at the relationship with that attitude, there is no \"right\" or \"wrong,\" because each person is dierent. No two patients are the same, so what is helpful to each one is \"right\" for that patient. EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"That's the way Can sound judgmental to think about it! Can set the patient up Good for you!\" for failure if the approval \"That's not a or disapproval does not good idea.\" help; can lower the nurse's credibility Techniques of Therapeutic/ Helping Communication Hildegard Peplau envisioned the nurse as a \"tool\" for ensuring positive interpersonal relationships with patients. Nurses are with the patient for approximately 8-12 hours daily. Compare that with the amount of time a physician is able to spend with the patient, and it is easy to see how the nurse becomes the therapeutic tool that helps the patient help himself or herself. This observation was noted by Florence Nightingale in her book, Notes on Nursing (Nightingale, originally pub- lished in 1859). Patients develop a different kind of rap- port with nurses because they learn to trust them. Although nurses' technical skills are very important and must never be allowed to get rusty, it is the appropriate use of their verbal and nonverbal communication skills that cements the relationship with patients and that ultimately promotes their healing. The previous section pointed out some of the bad habits of conversation. It is now time to learn new effective methods of com- munication. These will feel awkward at first, but with practice and trust, they will help improve the quality of interactions not only with patients, but in most interpersonal communication as well. They are \"tricks of the trade\" that may be as small as a one-word change in the way a sentence or request is presented, but they get a lot of mileage in the way people respond.CHAPTER 2|Basics of Communication 23 8.Changing the Subject. Nurses sometimes do this inadvertently. When schedules are busy and several patients need a nurse's attention at the same time, the nurse's agenda takes over, and the nurse starts to see to personal needs. It is very easy for a nurse to give a quick answer to a patient's question and then proceed with one's own agenda. Unfortunately, that may send the message to the patient that the nurse does not care or that this problem is not worthy of a nurse's time. This patient may be reluctant to oer more information to that nurse in the future. Changing the subject may also reflect the nurse's comfort (or discomfort) level with the subject. If the nurse just experienced the death of a loved one from a heart attack, for example, it may be very uncomfortable to answer a patient's questions about recovery and prognosis following his or her bypass surgery. The nurse may answer quickly and move on to a more comfortable topic, such as, \"Well, your physician has advanced your diet; that's good news!\" EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT The patient is Discounts the asking a question importance of the about his/her patient's need to prognosis and explore personal the nurse thoughts and feelings responds with, May be a reflection \"Did the doctor of the nurse's own say anything discomfort level with about discharging this topic you today?\" 9.Approving or Disapproving. This is similar to minimizing or agreeing. The patient perceives a value system that puts the nurse in the position of the expert, and, in many ways, the nurse is. That puts a big responsibility on a nurse's shoulders, however, and that responsibility includes being supportive without being judg- mental or portraying a personal idea of what is right or wrong, good or bad. The nurse is in a partnership of sorts with the patient. The nurse collaborates with the2993_Ch02_015-032 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 231.Reflecting, repeating, parroting. This tech- nique seems to be the easiest to learn and therefore is used the most often. Parrots are often trained to repeat words or phrases, such as \"Polly want a cracker?\" Reflecting, repeating, and parroting refer to this technique because that is what the nurse does: He or she picks a word or phrase that seems to be a key word or idea in what the patient is trying to communicate. It some- times involves a degree of guessing on the part of the nurse to check out the perceived mes- sage. For instance, if the patient says, \"I want to get out of here; everyone is against me,\" the nurse has several options for checking the main concern of the patient. The nurse will repeat a word or phrase from the patient's statement to reflect, or parrot, whatever is perceived to be the main concern. The nurse could say \"Everyone?\" or \"Against you?\" to try to encourage the patient to expand on these ideas. Caution: Because this technique might seem obvious to the patient, use par- roting sparingly. It will not take the patient too many times of hearing his or her words repeated before perhaps suggesting that the nurse look into having a good audiometric examination! EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT Patient: \"I'm so Encourages exploring tired of all of this.\" the meaning of the Nurse: \"Tired?\" statement Caution: Use sparingly, can be irritating if overused. 2.Clarifying terms. People live and work in a global society. Nurses interact with many dierent people as patients and coworkers. Nurses sometimes use wordsin dierent ways. The American vocabu- lary pronounces many words the same but spells them dierently. English is a very complex language to learn. Some people use terms very literally. Nursing is a profession that is lled with inference and nuance; it is highly aective. Because of that, it is very important to clarify terms with patients and other workers. Nurses must be sure that the terms they choose are correct and mean the same thing to all parties involved in the interaction. The technique is easy to learn: Simply asking \"When you say 'I can't do that,' what do you mean?\" is one way of clarifying a statement. The patient may mean \"I am not physically able\" or \"I am not morally able\" or \"I do not know how to do that\" or any number of things that the word can't may mean. If the nurse does not try to clarify that simple word, she could incorrectly infer the patient's level of ability or cooperation. EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"When you say Encourages patient to 'tired,' do you restate the comment mean it in a Improves chances that physical way the message sent is the or an emotional message received way?\" 3.Open-ended questions. These are the essence of successful nurse-patient communication. They are also among the hardest techniques to learn, because people are constantly bombarded with incorrect usage in social interaction and in the world of talk shows and news reporters. One of the goals of helping communica- tion is to get the patient to participate, so it is important that the nurse present questions in a way that will encourage the patient to pro- vide information without the nurse's sounding persistent or intrusive. Such a perception by the patient will be a major interference in future attempts at communication. The nurse needs to be able to detect cues provided by the patient when they would like to discontinue communication.24 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing The listed communication methods will not all work for all people in all circumstances, but if you use them faithfully you will see improve- ments in the way you relate to your patients and in the way they respond to you.Neeb's Tip2993_Ch02_015-032 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 24In some instances, \"yes\" or \"no\" may be all the nurse needs to know or all that the patient is capable of responding at the time. In those instances, closed-ended questions may be used until the patient is able to provide more information. Otherwise, open-ended ques- tions will get more productive results. EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"How are you Discourages \"yes\" or feeling today?\" \"no\" answers \"What can Encourages patient to I do to help, express self in his or Mr. Jones?\" her own terms Using open-ended questions can be helpful in understanding the patient's pain level. Ask- ing the patient \"Are you in Pain?\" (closed- ended question) may not bring an accurate picture. Depending on the patient's culture or religious preference, or both, \"pain\" may or may not be acceptable. The patient may answer \"yes\" or \"no\" on the basis of those be- liefs. If Ms. Green has a chemical dependency that has not been shared with you, she may say \"yes\" to get the benet of the pain med- ication. Pain is a very individual experience and is subjective. What one person considers to be extreme pain, another might brush o as a minor irritation. The closed-ended nature of this question does not require the patient to provide useful, measurable information that allows the nurse to be helpful or thera- peutic. A more helpful form of this question would be in an open-ended format, such as, \"Ms. Green, on a scale of 0 to 10, how do you rate your pain?\" or \"Ms. Green, please tell me about your pain.\" 4.Asking for what you need or want. This relates to the discussion on assertive ver- sus aggressive communication. Nurses can ask for what is needed and wanted from patients and coworkers and still maintain a pleasant, professional tone of voice. This technique requires the user to start the sentence with the words \"I want\" or \"I need.\" Taking the direct approach with people is usually the safest way to be sure that the receiver gets the message the sender intended to send. These two examples show ways to be assertive, direct, and self-responsible while still maintaining politeness and allowing the patient to have some control over his or her care. EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"Mrs. Smith, States purpose for the I need to ask you interaction a few questions, Keeps speaker assertive please.\" and self-responsible \"I want to switch shifts with Mary next T uesday, please.\" 5.Identifying thoughts and feelings. This is another dicult technique to master. Because words, which convey thoughts and feelings, are used incorrectly more frequently than not, it is hard to rein- force proper usage. The rule is simple: A feeling is an emotion. A \"feeling state- ment\" must identify an emotion that one is experiencing or is trying to explore with a patient. For example, \"I feel proud that I earned this promotion\" or \"I feel frightened to walk alone at night.\" A thought is an opinion, idea, or fact that one wishes to express. \"I think I deserve this promotion\" and \"I think security needs to be improved in the parking area\" are examples of \"thinking statements.\" \"I feel security needs to be improved in the parking area\" and \"I feel the patient needs a dierent pain medication\" are incorrect uses of the word \"feel.\" There is no emotion iden- tied in these statements. \"Feeling\" is certainly implied, but implied thoughts and feelings need to be claried to avoid mistaken conclu- sions. In both of these statements \"feel\" should be replaced with \"think\" for correct usage. Using words pertaining to thought and feeling correctly will minimize the amount of time the nurse must spend clarifying and will maximize the quality of the interaction. In the mental health specialty, it becomes even more important for the nurse to use such terms appropriately to help the patient identify and label his or her emotions and thoughts to facilitate therapy.CHAPTER 2|Basics of Communication 252993_Ch02_015-032 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 2526 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"I feel angry Helps the patient to when you are identify and label not honest thoughts and emotions with me.\" May give insight to \"I think honesty underlying concerns is important in or complications of all relationships.\" healing 6.Using empathy. Empathy is also tied into feelings. There is a big dierence between sympathy and empathy. Sympathy is used socially when people wish to share emo- tional experiences. It is not a therapeutic technique because it involves experienc- ing the emotion. Empathy involves iden- tifying emotions without experiencing the emotion. Nurses need to use empathy with patients. They need to be able to identify the emotion and relate to it while keeping the focus on the patient's needs. Nurses must help patients deal with their feelings and still maintain professional control of the situation; the nurse needs to remain the helper. Sympathy often allows both persons to be- come emotionally invested in the moment. The focus is shared by both people. In thera- peutic relationships, the focus must remain on the patient. Consider the following situation: A nurse notices a patient crying in the lounge. The nurse wants to help, so he approaches the patient, sits down, and oers his assistance. The patient tells the nurse of the news that that she just found out that her pet died. The pet had been her \"family\" since her divorce. The pet had always \"been there for her,\" and the pet has died while she has been in the hospital and could not be there. The nurse's response options are: Sympathy: Remembering his own favorite pet who died, the nurse says, \"I understand your feelings; my pet died suddenly, too.\" OR Empathy: Remembering his own pet who died, the nurse allows himself to feel that pain and then says, \"I am so sorry. It must be very painful to lose something you feel so close to. I'd like to hear aboutyour pet when you think you'd like to talk about it.\" Socially, chances are that the nurse might take the \"sympathy\" option, which would be appropriate with people who are not patients. Patients need the nurse to be sensitive but still be the helper. The \"empathy\" option is more appropriate in most therapeutic situations. EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"It must feel Acknowledges patient's very demeaning feelings when others are Keeps nurse in position of dishonest.\" control and helpfulness \"I can only imagine how dicult this has been.\" 7.Silence. Silence serves many functions in communication, yet many people are very uncomfortable with it. American so- ciety seems to value conversation. People use vocabulary and the ability to talk about a variety of topics as a measure of intelligence and social grace. Watch what happens at a social gathering or in the break room when a short silence occurs. Often, people dget nervously or make \"small talk\" just to break the silence. Silence, as a therapeutic technique of com- munication, serves two main purposes: First, it allows the nurse and the patient a short time to collect their thoughts and, second, it shows patience and acceptance on the part of the nurse. Sitting quietly for a period of time, usually 2 to 3 minutes, and maintaining an open body posture sends the message that the nurse is willing to wait if the patient has more to say or that the nurse accepts the fact that the interaction may be over for the present. Silence can be just as powerful and eective as any verbal interaction. Caution: Do not allow the silence to go on too long. If nothing has been said by either party within 2 to 3 minutes, it is wise to sug- gest to the patient that it might be time for a rest. Then the nurse should take cues from the patient's response. Perhaps the conversation will begin again, or maybe the patient will be grateful for the suggestion to rest. Either way,2993_Ch02_015-032 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 26the nurse can let the patient know that he or she is there if the patient wants to talk again at another time. EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT Sit quietly near Shows the nurse is the patient comfortable with whatever the patient says and willing to hear more Allows both to collect their thoughtsUsing this combination of oering assis- tance and asking an open-ended question serves several purposes: The nurse has main- tained rapport and has gotten Mrs. Brown to divulge her level of prior knowledge, and the nurse has let Mrs. Brown know that the nurse presumes she has had a conversation with the physician. What if Mrs. Brown hesitates or tells the nurse outright that the physician has not been in yet? The nurse should use the techniques of stating his or her needs and using empathy, and tell the patient very hon- estly, \"Mrs. Brown, I can sense your frustra- tion, but I cannot legally (or ethically) give you that information until you and your physician have discussed it rst. I'll be happy to call your physician to let her know that you wish to see her as soon as possible. After you have talked, I'll be happy to answer any ques- tions you may have.\" EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"Mrs. Brown, Increases rapport I would be glad Eases patient's anxiety to explain this Honestly conrms that diagnosis to you. the physician has given Tell me what the prior information doctor has said, Suggests collaboration and I'll clarify it for you any way I can.\" 9.Using general leads. This is a method of encouraging the person to continue speaking. It lets the speaker know that one is listening and interested in hearing more. The technique is fairly simple: It involves verbal and usually nonverbal communication. Examples of general leads are saying \"Yes?\" while maybe rais- ing the eyes, \"Go on\" while maintaining eye contact and possibly nodding the head in an armative motion, or just saying \"and then?\" if the person pauses in the middle of a statement or concern. EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"Go on\" while Feels valued and nodding head listened to and maintaining eye contactCHAPTER 2|Basics of Communication 27 Silence demonstrates that the nurse is willing to hear more.Neeb's Tip 8.Giving information. This is very dierent from the communication block of giving advice. Giving information relates to the helping relationship because it involves a form of teaching. As mentioned earlier, physicians are usu- ally with their patients for very short periods of time, whereas nurses are usually with the same patients for an 8-12 hour shift. It is very natural for nurses and patients to have more quality time for talking. This is one reason patient teaching is becoming a bigger part of a nurse's responsibility in all levels of nursing. Nurses provide information in all phases of hospitalization, from preoperative teaching to discharge planning. It involves using pam- phlets, videos, resource manuals, or other resource persons. Most state nurse practice acts still place the stipulation that the nurse may not legally give information to the patient before the physician has given the initial information. This means that nurses may not give lab reports, read diagnostic information, talk about possible treatments, and so forth until these have rst been discussed between physician and patient. How do nurses know this has occurred? Nurses use therapeu- tic techniques that allow them to ask questions that get results.Neeb's Tip2993_Ch02_015-032 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 2710.Stating implied thoughts and feelings. This takes a combination of skills. It requires using some guessing (as in reflecting), using empathy, and making an observation about a behavior or condition the nurse sees in the patient. This technique is helpful in initiating conversation that might be dicult to start with other techniques. It is hard to deny that something is not right when someone identi- es a specic behavior or action that supports the suggestion that something is dierent about the patient. Nurses are assessing their patient's physical and emotional states all the time. When a patient is reluctant to share this situation, the nurse can preface the question with an observation and then follow with an educated guess at the emotion that is being experienced. EXAMPLE EFFECT ON PATIENT \"Ms. Johnson, Lets the patient know you're not smiling you are paying attention today like you to him or her usually do. I sense Identies a specic something is behavior or change in bothering you. behavior, which lowers How can I help?\" the chance of denying it Patient hears that the nurse cares and wishes to help Adaptive Communication Techniques Some populations of people, such as those mentioned in the previous section, require special considerations when nurses are com- municating with them. These are some ways of facilitating communication with people who live with certain disabilities or who have varied amounts of ability. People Who Are Hearing- Impaired When communicating with a patient who is hearing-impaired, it is important to know the extent of the impairment. Does the personspeech-read (also called lip-read)? Is he or she reliant on a hearing aid? What is the emo- tional attitude of the patient? Communicating can be very frustrating for hearing-impaired patients as well as for the nurse. Hearing-impaired patients often use sign language, but most \"hearing\" people do not know sign language. Sometimes writ- ing with pencil and paper is eective, but it is slow. Speech reading is helpful to some hearing-impaired people, but it is not always accurate. Because many words that look the same are in fact very dierent in meaning, and because not all speaking people say words the same way (because of dialect or dierent primary language from that of the hearing-impaired person), speech reading can be misleading at best.28 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Tool Box |This Web site can be used to access American Sign Language vocabulary: http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/ browser.htm People Who Are Visually Impaired Adaptive devices such as audio books, Braille- prepared computers, and seeing-eye dogs can be extremely helpful. The type of adaptive device depends on the type and severity of the impairment. Technology has provided some methods, such as the ability to change the font size on a computer up to 500%. Visually impaired people often have heightened senses of hearing, touch. Do not assume that visually impaired people may be hearing impaired, too. It usually is not necessary to talk slower or louder to a person with a visual impairment.Neeb's Tip People Who Have Laryngectomies Technology has developed several dierent aids that amplify the vibrations of speech. For some patients with laryngectomies, placing an amplier over the area of the larynx and2993_Ch02_015-032 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 28talking will produce a buzzing sound that replicates their former voice. It is a monotone sound, but it greatly improves the ability of these patients to communicate in a more natural manner. Not everyone can use these devices, however. Some people need to rely on communication boards and pictures to communicate. Some people make use of new computer-assisted devices. The patient will be in close contact with a speech therapist. Nurses need to be involved with the therapist as well, so that the patient has continuity of therapy and good evaluation of the ability to use the devices. The patient's plan of care needs to identify how the speech therapist treatment plan can continue when the patient is discharged from therapy. The goal is to re- store the person to his or her surgical maximal ability of speech. It can be a frightening and frustrating time for the patient and the health- care team, but the rewards are great when speech, at whatever level, begins to return. People With Language Differences Honesty is the best policy here. This discus- sion comes up in several sections of this text, but it is much better to apologize and admit when one is not receiving the sender's mes- sage. Serious mistakes can be made when one assumes the meaning of the message. It is also important to remember that communicating is often a highly cultural activity; people are not always comfortable asking for correction or clarication from someone of a dierent gender, age, or social or professional status. Using assertive, honest communication skills will usually get positive results. for each patient. The physician and speech pathologist or therapist are excellent resource people to help in deciding what type of adaptive technique will be the most effec- tive. The nurse's documentation of the responses of a patient to the various tech- niques will also help in these decisions. Techniques range from changing the rate or pitch of speech to using objects, pictures, spelling boards, or computerized equipment if the patient has access to them (Fig. 2-3). However, nurses should not answer for the patient. Finishing sentences or trying to play guessing games with people who have these types of disorders is usually not in the best in- terest of the patient. It may take a longer time for these patients to process the informationCHAPTER 2|Basics of Communication 29 As a caregiver, the nurse needs to practice active listening.

When the patient is getting frustrated or is truly unable to respond properly, it may be because the words the nurse used were unfamiliar or maybe too much time has passed and the pa- tient has forgotten the question. Gentle hints or rephrasing the question may be enough to help the patient. It may be just one word that makes the dierence between the patient's being successful or not. Communication in all forms is essential to the work of a nurse. Taking the time to learn and use these techniques can make relation- ships with patients and coworkers very pleas- ant and rewarding.REFERENCES Grinder, J., and Bandler, R.

Inter- personal communication is a complex process. 2.Therapeutic or helping communication is a language that is learned and shared by nurses. It is a purposeful skill that requires practice. 3.People communicate verbally and non- verbally. Nonverbal communication sends a stronger message than verbal communication. 4.Communication can be assertive or aggressive. Assertive statements are the more helpful of the two; they start with the word \"I.\" Aggressive statements are designed to place responsibility on another person. They start with the word \"you.\" 5.Nurses need to be aware of what blocks therapeutic communication. 6.Nurses need to be aware what techniques to use to encourage eective, helping communication with patients. 7.Special techniques are used when com- municating with populations who have special communication needs.2993_Ch02_015-032 14/01/14 5:16 PM Page 30CHAPTER 2|Basics of Communication 31 1.Which of the following is an example of a therapeutic, open-ended question? a.\"Why did you do that, Mrs. Jones?\" b.\"How can I help you, Mr. Thompson?\" c.\"Can I help you, Ms. Greene?\" d.\"Please, can I ask you a question, of \"therapeutic communica- tion\" is to: a.Develop a friendly, social relationship with the patient. b.Develop a parental, authoritarian relationship with the patient. c.Develop a helping, purposeful relation- ship with the patient. d.Develop a cool, businesslike relation- ship with the patient. 3.You observe a patient in the family lounge. She appears to be talking to her- self. You want to nd out what is wrong. Your best approach to her might be: a.\"Who are you talking to?\" b.\"Please stop talking. You are disturbing the other people.\" c.\"I saw your lips moving. Can you tell me what you are talking about?\" d.\"Why are you talking to yourself?\" 4.Your patient asks you the results of his blood tests.

Merriam-Webster Online denes professional as an adjective meaning \"charac- terized by or conforming to the technical or ethical standards of a profession.\" It may be a term that requires a nurse to rely on the ther- apeutic communication skill of clarifying. Nursing is a profession. Nurses care for patients and perform designated services for a salary. As a profession, however, the different levels of nursing disagree as to who is a \"professional nurse.\" All nurses re- ceive pay for their work, yet it is commonly accepted that only registered nurses (RNs)are considered professional nurses; the licensed practical nurse (LPN) or licensed vocational nurse (LVN) is considered a non- professional. In areas with union represen- tation in nursing, the two levels usually belong to separate organizations. Some nursing groups believe that only RNs who are baccalaureate-prepared and beyond are considered professional. Nevertheless, all nurses are expected to be- have in a professional manner; they are to per- form at the highest level of preparation they have achieved. Nurses are to abide by federal, state, and local guidelines. Another aspect of professionalism is the duty to stay in- formed in the nursing eld.

Professional behavior is maintained despite any personal problems a nurse is experienc- ing. A nurse's personal problems are to be handled outside of the work environment. Nurses are expected to be respectful of the be- liefs of their patients and coworkers and not to force their personal beliefs on others at work. Nurses are expected to perform hon- estly. They are expected to report any infrac- tions they notice in other nurses. In short, nurses are expected to behave and perform in a manner that promotes the pride and repu- tation of the nursing profession, and not as a detriment to that profession. Ethics Part of being a professional is to conduct oneself in an appropriate and ethical man- ner. Nurses deal with ethical issues on a daily basis, so it is important to consider one's own values and professional ethics. The Codes of Ethics of the American Nurses Association and the National Federation of Licensed Practical Nurses (Appendix D) have established guidelines for the nursing profession. These guidelines pr ovide a frame- work for action rather than give answers to questions. Standards of Care The National Federation of Licensed Practical Nurses (NFLPN) has adopted Standards of Nursing Practice for LPNs/LVNs (see Appendix D). These standards include a code of conduct. The American Nurses Association (ANA) has written a variety of standards of care covering topics important to the nursing profession. Some of these are relevant to LVNs/LPNs. The purpose of the ANA is fostering high standards of nursing practice, promoting the rights of nurses in the work- place, projecting a positive and realistic view of nursing, and lobbying Congress and regu- latory agencies on health-care issues aecting nurses and the public. A set of Standards of Psychiatric-Mental Health Clinical Nursing Practice, written by the American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA), is available at the APNA Web site as well as ANA Web site. The revised standards are to be published in 2014. Nurse Practice Act Nurses must be aware of their state's Nurse Practice Act and perform within its parame- ters. The Nurse Practice Act dictates the ac- ceptable scope of nursing practice for the dierent levels of nursing. When a nurse is questioning whether or not to perform a cer- tain skill or perhaps is accused of wrongdoing, the Nurse Practice Act typically is consulted to nd out if that nurse is performing at the accepted level of preparation. For example, if a state does not allow the LPN/LVN to supervise patient care yet an LPN or LVN is the only licensed sta on duty on the night shift, the Nurse Practice Act for that state may have been ignored, and that nurse could be held liable for damages in a court of law.34 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Critical Thinking Question You are an LPN or an LVN on the surgical unit of the county hospital. In shift report, you are told that you will be getting a new postoperative patient within the hour. When the patient arrives, a police ocer is in attendance. The ocer tells you that this patient is a suspect in a homicide. The ocer instructs you to report anything the patient says to you. When you begin your postoperative vital signs, the patient says, \"Nurse, I shot the guy and he deserved it. I'll do it again if I have to. I can tell you, because you can't tell anyone!\" How will you handle this situation? Tool Box |The Code of Ethics from the American Nurses Association can be reviewed at: www.nursingworld.org/codeofethicsTool Box |ANA materials can be accessed at: www.nursingworld.org Standards of Psychiatric-Mental Health Clinical Nursing Practice draft 34This can be an ethical dilemma as well. It may be the facility's interpretation that it is permissible to allow that LPN/LVN to func- tion as supervisor if an RN is on call. This may or may not be the interpretation of the particular state. The Board of Nursing in a particular state can give the answer. Any nurse has the right and responsibility to make that phone call. Accuracy The ultimate goal of the helping person in health care is to \"do no harm.\" Safety for their patients and themselves must be in nurses' thoughts at all times. Harm can be described as intentional or unintentional and falls under the category of a tort, which relates to civil law. Civil laws protect patients/persons and their property. A nurse's best defense is the quality of ver- bal and written communication. In her book, Legal, Ethical, and Political Issues in Nursing, Tonia Aiken indicates that spelling errors are crucial in liability cases, as they reflect on a nurse's general ability to care for patients. Legally, the general assumption is \"if it is not charted, it has not been done.\" Some situa- tions can impede nurses' eorts at accuracy in charting. First of all, nurses are busy. Patient care is the primary focus of a nurse's workday. Many times, it seems that the shift is over be- fore it starts. Charting may be scaled down to a minimum, especially if the employer does not pay for overtime. As accurate charting is part of nursing care, this became the rationale for developing dierent types of charting. Some facilities use a form of charting that may be called \"charting by exception.\" This type of documentation is based on flow-sheet charting. Normal values, the guidelines for which are established at the facility, are writ- ten on the chart form, and the nurse uses aseries of check marks and arrows to indicate assessments of all systems have been made. The nurse then initials the check marks and arrows and uses a full signature at the bottom of the page. Only situations outside of the es- tablished normal parameters are mentioned in some sort of nurse's note. Although this type of charting saves time, it is sometimes challenged legally because it is not always enough documentation. Yet flow sheet chart- ing is gaining popularity in documenting health care. Many facilities use flow-sheet charting, and an increasing number are using electronic programs designed for patient charting that are specic for a facility. \"Epic\" is one of the electronic programs used by many facilities. It is imperative that the nurse take (sub- junctive) as much time as necessary to carry out complete, accurate documentation on each patient. A nurse's competency to practice nursing can be questioned if for some reason the documentation is subpoenaed in a court case and spelling and grammar are of poor quality according to American standards. All agencies have an established method for verbal reporting. It may be a taped shift report, a grand rounds type of report, or a one-on-one report with the patient's careCHAPTER 3|Ethics and Law 35 Classroom Activity In Appendix E, review NFLPN Nursing Practice Standards Legal/Ethical Status. Write a paragraph on how each of these standards relates to a prac- tical/vocational nurse. The nurse needs to be procient in reading, writing, and spelling skills. Nursing programs use a system including testing to determine if nursing candidates are procient in reading, writing, and math prior to being admitted into a program (e.g., HESI's, TEAS V). Not only might gaps in reading, writing, and spell - ing be a source of extreme embar- rassment to the nurse, but they are also unacceptable as professional, safe nursing practice. It is important to note as well that this is a much more common problem in the United States than one might think and that it is not just people from other countries who experience this diculty. Basic computer skills are also increasingly required.Neeb's Tip2993_Ch03_033-050 14/01/14 5:17 PM Page 35plan. Again, it is important for the nurse to spend as much time as needed to get the mes- sage from his or her day's work to the receiver for the oncoming shift. Be thorough but as concise as possible. It is usually standard pro- cedure to discuss vital signs, physical assess- ments, any visits from physicians or visitors, new orders, responses to medications and treatments, and any change in condition. An area that is sometimes forgotten is the mental, emotional, and behavioral status of the patient, especially on a medical surgical unit. Usually, the patient's mental, emotional, and behavioral status is mentioned only if something seems inappropriate. Physical heal- ing is to a large extent a result of attitude and emotional condition; therefore, nurses should include the patient's psychological status in their verbal report. A nurse should always check with the incoming nurse to be sure that there are no further questions and inform that nurse of anything he may not have completed. Honesty It may seem insulting to discuss honesty and integrity with nursing students. After all, honesty, or \"veracity\" as it is also called, is one of the qualities of professionalism. The dis- cussion is necessary, though, because honesty means dierent things to dierent people. It may mean \"surviving\" or \"helping someone less able than myself\" or \"telling the physicianwhat he or she wants to hear.\" Honesty is a concept that can be highly cultural. The professional choice is always to tell the truth. It may be painful, frightening, or embar- rassing to admit personal conflicts or errors or omissions in patient care, but nurses will avoid further potential harm to their patient as well as to their professional reputation by admitting to mistakes and taking the appropriate corrective measures. Nurses are human. Despite their best eorts and multiple medication checks, nurses make mistakes. Recognizing them, ad- mitting them, and taking corrective measures to ensure the patient's safety are the signs of sound judgment and professional nursing behavior. Honesty can also mean the dierence between keeping and losing your nursing license. Impaired Nurses Inappropriate use and misuse of mind-altering chemicals such as alcohol or prescription and nonprescription drugs can render a nurse legally unsafe. Continuing to practice nursing while using these chemicals displays unpro- fessional behavior and poor judgment. A nurse in this situation who is fearful of losing his or her license or unable to seek help may consider inaccurate charting, omission of certain charting, or blatant lying about a sit- uation as a way to remain employed. The patient's safety is not the nurse's primary con- cern when this happens. Most states have developed programs to assist impaired nurses as a way to protect the public. According to the Recovery and Monitoring Program (RAMP) in New Jersey, if a health profes- sional is impaired and working with patients, an occupational hazard eventually will occur, possibly causing an injury or even a death.36 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Critical Thinking Question You are the nurse who is supervising care on the shift 2100 to 0700. Another nurse who works this shift routinely has poor-quality charting. Nothing is hidden or omitted from the chart, but it contains many misspelled words and many grammatical errors. You decide to \"keep the peace\" and say nothing because you get along well with this nurse and the patients like the individual. Patient X falls out of bed on your shift, and the family sues for negligence. The other nurse is found incompe- tent by virtue of written documentation that the lawyers cannot decipher. To your dismay, you are also implicated as the supervising nurse on that shift because you did nothing to improve the quality of this nurse's writing skills. What are your feelings? What might this mean for you? What will your defense be to the court? How will you handle this dierently in the future? Critical Thinking Question You are working on an Oncology unit, and a nurse who has been considered reliable and account- able by all of his/her coworkers in the past is now suspected of some type of impairment due to re- cent changes in behavior. This nurse frequently oers to give your patients pain medicines if you are busy. The nurse's coworkers have noted that immediately before or after giving a narcotic, the nurse usually has to use the bathroom. How would you approach this situation? 2993_Ch03_033-050 14/01/14 5:17 PM Page 36Culture of Nurses A commonly accepted denition of culture includes nonphysical traits, rituals, values, and traditions that are handed down from generation to generation. Nursing is an occu- pation that passes its professional values, rit- uals, and traditions from generation to generation (Fig. 3-1). The aective, or attitu- dinal, components of nursing are behaviors that nurses typically learn from role modeling other nurses. This concept spawned the term culture of nurses (Neeb, 1994). As mentioned earlier, nurses live and work in a global community. Nurses were born and raised in many different places. They have different ideas about politics and social issues. However, when nurses come together as a profession, they meld these ideas into consistent behaviors to provide their patients with the best possible care. Nurses may need to give up some personal ideas while working to make the whole of nursing greater than the sum of its parts. This means that skills such as spelling and grammar that may be \"correct\" or actually considered unimportant in personal situa- tions are not acceptable for practicing nursing in the United States (Aiken, 2004). This is not an issue of labeling a nurse's personal or cultural belief system as right, wrong, good, or bad. Rather, it means that nurses must remember the componentsof professionalism and basic tenets of communication. The field of study called proxemics is also cultural. Proxemics concerns space, time, and waiting, which are all influenced by one's culture. If you have ever traveled between the northern and southern tier of the United States, you may have noticed a cultural difference in time and waiting. People in the northern states tend to be much more rushed. They may watch the clock in restaurants, in classrooms, and while on hold on the telephone. In the southern states, life is a bit slower-paced. That hamburger does not have to be served in 2 minutes; people just wait and relax. This is not an issue of right or wrong, good or bad. It is an issue of differences in the way people are acculturated. For nurses from countries in which time- liness is not an issue, punching a time clock or serving a medication within the allotted time may not be a priority. As nurses know, however, this sort of timeliness is a very im- portant part of nursing culture. A patient who is in pain and asks for a pain medication expects the nurse to be prompt with it. If the nurse replies, \"I'll be there in a minute,\" the patient might hear the word \"minute\" and take it quite literally. After all, the patient is the one in need. It may actually have taken the nurse 15 minutes to return with the med- ication, and in that time he or she may have answered two more call signals, helped some- one to the bathroom, and taken a physician's order. However, that patient who is waiting for the medication knows only that the nurse did not return in a minute. Depending on that patient's culture, he may have used the call signal immediately after 1 minute passed or may feel it is grossly disrespectful to ask again and thus suer silently. Space and distance also constitute a big part of nursing culture. Nurses must touch patients in order to do their jobs. Nurses make full body assessments, catheterize, give suppositories, and perform prenatal and post- natal checks. Male and female nurses work on male and female patients. In a way, nurses become desensitized to these functions, as they become a routine part of their jobs.CHAPTER 3|Ethics and Law 37 Figure 3-1 The culture of nursing. Through role modeling, professional values, rituals, and traditions are passed from one generation of nurses to the next. (From Sorrell and Redmond (2007): Community-Based Nursing Practice: Learning Through Students' Stories. Philadelphia: F Davis Company, with permission.)2993_Ch03_033-050 14/01/14 5:17 PM Page 37Some patients are very timid and modest. In some cultures, strangers may not touch strangers in certain ways, and these individuals may prefer to have family members perform those tasks. Some nurses feel uncomfortable waking postoperative patients for their routine vital signs check because in their culture it is not proper to awaken sick people; it is proper to let them sleep and not disturb them. Nurses need to be aware of four types of spaces: public, social, personal, and intimate. Nurses are often in intimate space in their practice, especially when giving direct care. Proxemics is a very complex eld of study; this discussion has touched only on some basics. It is important for nurses to under- stand, however, that the concepts of space, time, and waiting are highly cultural in their interpretation.The doctrine of privileged information is a bond between patient and physician. Under this doctrine, the physician has the right to refuse to answer certain questions (e.g., in a court of law) and can cite \"privi- leged physician-patient information.\" Nurses are usually not included in this relationship. If information is requested of nurses in a legal situation, they must answer as truthfully as they can. How does one maintain honesty and condentiality at the same time? First and foremost, a nurse should communicate honestly to the patient that he or she cannot make promises. When the nurse senses that the patient is revealing information that is potentially legally sensitive, it is a good idea to tell the patient right away that nurses are not protected by the doctrine of privileged in- formation. The nurse should tell the patient that he or she can call the physician, but if the patient still chooses to share such informa- tion, a good technique is to tell the patient the information will have to be shared with a supervisor or others involved in the patient's treatment. The 1976 case of T araso vs. Regents of the University of California is the standard for the doctrine of privileged infor- mation. The doctrine also protects intended victims of patients who may be hospitalized or incarcerated. A nurse should inform the patient that only those parts of the conversa- tion that are directly related to his or her care will be shared, but that if information is requested by a legal representative, the nurse will be required to answer.38 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Nurses must work together for the better- ment of patient care. When in doubt, ask. Learn from each other. There is no better way for personal and professional enrichment. Confidentiality Condentiality is so important that it is singled out as one of the federal and state patient rights. Condential means (1): marked by intimacy or condences, and (4): containing information whose unauthorized disclosure could be prejudicial to the national interest (Merriam-Webster online). T rusting a friend with a secret only to hear that secret had been repeated to someone else is a break in condentiality. In a manner of speaking, a patient's diagnosis and plan of care are a secret to everyone but the patient and the health-care team; this information is very private and must be kept that way. But what happens when the patient shares some- thing that must be passed on?Tool Box |2011 A guide to cross-cultural etiquette and understanding can be found at www.culturecrossing.net/ When you sense that the patient is telling you information that is potentially legally sensitive, it is a good idea to tell the patient right away that you as a nurse are not protected by the Doctrine of Privi- leged Information.Neeb's Tip Temptations are common, especially for the student nurse. It is fun and exciting to learn new information and to see your skills making a dierence in someone's recovery. It is easy to start chatting about your experi- ences to another student or to a sta nurse,2993_Ch03_033-050 14/01/14 5:17 PM Page 38but be careful. The person nearby (e.g., in the elevator with you) may be a friend or family member. Unless specically indicated by the patient, these people do not ordinarily have rights to information about the patient. There are many horror stories about innocent conversations that were overheard by the \"wrong\" people, which resulted in negative consequences to the patient and/or the nurse involved. Whoever said hospitals were quiet places probably never worked in one. Nurses and physicians talk often, and usually not quietly. \"Dr. X is on the phone about Mrs. D's bowel surgery,\" calls the unit coordinator to the nurse across the hall. \"Is Mr. B's insulin up yet?\" asks the nursing assistant from the kitchenette. \"Nurse Y needs to know.\" This happens not only in the hospital, but also in physicians' oces. Consider a situation in a physician's oce where a nurse shouts from the front desk that she just received Mrs. A's urine specimen results. \"My goodness! Mrs. A has enough E. coli in her urine to kill a horse.\" Unfortunately for Mrs. A, she was the last person to enter the oce with the last name starting with an \"A\". The physician's of- ce was not equipped with a glass partition between the waiting room and the front desk. How many other patients or people pass- ing through the area might have heard those interchanges? How would the patient feel if he or she knew that personal information had been handled so thoughtlessly? Remem- ber that patients can interpret messages dif- ferently than a nurse. These breaches of condentiality happen all the time, but that does not make them acceptable. Nurses must take the extra steps required to give or receive information quietly to the appropri- ate people (Fig. 3-2). Charts, too, can put condentiality at risk. How many eyes may have seen a chart acci- dentally left open when the nurse went to answer a call signal? What about the report sheet? Some nurses call these sheets their \"brain's cheat sheet.\" Nurses should be sure to keep their reports with them at all times. Here is an example how a simple act of dropping a piece of paper led to a major event. The nurse's\"cheat sheet\" was found on the floor. The report sheet had fallen from a nurse's pocket and had been picked up by a patient's family member. This person could have brought the paper to the desk immediately and the story would have ended there, but that was not the case. At the end of the shift, the family mem- ber brought the piece of paper to the nurse in charge. None of the items on the list had been carried out, according to the family member who had been there the greater part of the day. Unfortunately for the nurse, the tasks had been charted as being completed. This display of unprofessional and irresponsible behavior was one thing; the family member main- tained, however, that anyone could have picked up that piece of paper and learned many personal things about the patient. It contained information not only about that patient but perhaps information about other patients assigned to that nurse. The family member sued for breach of condentiality and won the suit. Granted, this is a drastic example of what can happen, and laws regarding these situations vary from state to state. The story emphasizes that nurses must be careful with patient information of any kind and always maintain honesty in documentation. In these days of computerized, paperless doc- umentation, nurses are vulnerable to breeches of condentiality. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Joint Commission (JC) are intimately involved in documentation and privacy issues.CHAPTER 3|Ethics and Law 39 Figure 3-2 Maintaining privacy is a patient right and conveys caring to the patient. (Photograph by Wendy Hope.)2993_Ch03_033-050 14/01/14 5:17 PM Page 39Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) was developed by the Department of Health and Human Services to provide national standards pertaining to the electronic trans- mission and communication of medical information between patients, providers, employers, and insurers. HIPAA allows more control on the part of the patient as to what part of his or her information is disclosed. It addresses the security and pri- vacy involved with medical records and how that information is identified and passed between care providers. For example, Social Security numbers, which were routinely used as a patient identifier in the recent past, now are either not used or are used in some manner that is difficult to track, such as a partial number or a backward number. HIPAA was implemented in April of 2003. Some areas of health care, such as workers' compensation, are either exempt from HIPAA rules or are slightly less stringent in the passing of information.consent (discussed in the Crisis Intervention section in Chapter 8). Joint Commission The Joint Commission (JC) is the leading national accrediting body of health-care organizations. Earning accreditation by the Joint Commission indicates commitment to quality on a daily basis within the entire facility. T wo other goals of a JC accreditation are reducing the risk of undesirable patient outcomes and encouraging continuous improvement. Originally established to sur- vey hospitals, the accreditation can now be achieved by long-term care facilities, mental health agencies, home health, and hospices to provide quality care, including mental health and substance abuse treatment to children, adolescents, and adults. Accredited facilities and clinics have demonstrated compliance with the highest standards of clinical care and administrative quality. In 2004, the JC established the National Patient Safety Goals (NPSG). These goals are revised annually. Sentinel events, identifying the sources of hospital acquired infections (HAI), ensuring two-patient identiers, and a list of \"dangerous abbreviations\" are among these goals. 40 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Clinical Activity During your clinical rotation, observe the facility's Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) policy. Where is the policy located? Note during your clinical experience if the HIPAA policy is violated by whom and how many times. In June of 2004, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Center for Substance Abuse T reatment pub- lished a 25-page document entitled \"The Condentiality of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records Regulation and the HIPAA Privacy Rule: Implications for Alcohol and Substance Abuse Programs.\" The document is located at www.samhsa.gov.

You have been assigned a female patient called \"Ms. X.\" You are curious about the fact that Ms. X is not using her real name. While reading her chart, you learn she is in an abusive relationship. You see the warning that \"Ms. X's husband is not allowed in the unit at any time.\" When you go to meet the patient, you are shocked; Ms. X is your next-door neigh- bor. What do you do? What do you say to her husband? What do you say when your family asks you, \"What happened?\"2993_Ch03_033-050 14/01/14 5:17 PM Page 40 Responsibility Responsibility is a key concept at all levels of nursing practice; however, responsibility does not necessarily mean independence. Respon- sibility for the professional RN can mean dif- ferent things than it does for the LPN/LVN. Nurses are expected to know their scope of practice for their state. Responsibility means performing to the best of one's ability within the boundaries of that scope of practice. Sometimes this means knowing when to say \"No.\" Sometimes it means calling the state governing agency to ask specic questions. Responsible behavior for a nurse also means keeping his or her personal life in a manageable state. \"Nurse, heal thyself\" is not an unrealistic statement. Nurses need to be physically and emotionally prepared to be helpful to patients, and this cannot be done if one's personal health is neglected. Nobody wants to be tended by a nurse who is not sleeping well or is preoccupied with personal problems. A good rule for nurses is to follow the recommendations in their personal lives that they would give to their patients. It is the nurse's responsibility to commu- nicate with patients and coworkers. Nurses must be alert to changes in patients' condi- tions, both physical and psychological. The actions nurses perform, the observations they make, and the documentation they complete are the most eective ways to be helpful and to ensure continuity of care for patients. Nurses also have a responsibility to their coworkers. Agencies have dierent ways of or- ganizing the way nurses perform their jobs. Some agencies practice \"team\" nursing, and some assign primary-care patients for whom the nurse is responsible for managing care during the entire hospitalization. Some facil- ities use a \"buddy\" system to ensure help for lifting and to cover the patient load during breaks or meetings. Regardless of the system used, each nurse is in some way interdepen - dent on other sta members. Nurses also have a responsibility to com- municate eectively with coworkers. Being familiar with the techniques of communica- tion discussed in Chapter 2 will ensure that nurses are able to address these behaviorsmore assertively. The responsibility nurses have for each other professionally may be dierent from the kind they have for their patients, but it is every bit as important, for it ultimately aects the quality of care nurses are able to give. Accountability Accountability is part of working indepen - dently within his/her scope of practice. A nurse is accountable for his/her own actions. Being accountable is important in all settings, including hospital, long-term care, home care, oce setting, and psychiatric facilities. It means knowing when to ask for help, nding a reference to refresh the memory, or looking up a medication that is not familiar. It means doing everything the nurse possibly can to en- sure that he/she is providing the safest, most accurate care to patients. It means that when the nurse says he will follow through with an order or a request, he will do so.CHAPTER 3|Ethics and Law 41 Critical Thinking Question You depend on the other sta members to come to work. What happens when you must work one or two people short? Who really suers as a result? How do you feel when your \"buddy\" or helper overstays a break or mealtime? What is your response to that? How does that aect the amount of time your patients may have needed? What about your ability to perform safely when you are lling in for someone who is not there? Abiding by the Current Laws Good Samaritan Laws Good Samaritan laws oer immunity for citizens who stop to help someone in need of medical help. Nurses, physicians, and other medically trained personnel may not always be protected by Good Samaritan laws. The Good Samaritan law came out of tort law. A tort is a \"a wrongful act other than a breach of contract for which relief may be obtained in the form of damages or an injunction\" (Merriam-Webster Online). The Good Samaritan law varies from state to 2993_Ch03_033-050 14/01/14 5:17 PM Page 41state, so it is important to understand the implication of this law in your state. The basis for all Good Samaritan laws, however, is that a third party cannot be charged with negli- gence unless help is given recklessly or that person makes the situation signicantly worse, according to the guidelines for that particular state.embarrassing to be labeled \"mentally ill\"; this diagnosis can follow a person for life and aect his or her personal and professional relationships. Being diagnosed with a mental illness could possibly hinder a person from attaining life insurance. It is no wonder that sometimes people allow themselves to be hos- pitalized for a mental illness only as a last resort. Patients who agree to voluntary treat- ment are legally allowed to sign themselves out; this is often discouraged by the treatment sta except under certain situations, and it is possible for the sta to institute an invol- untary commitment for a patient if they consider him or her to be potentially danger- ous. Voluntary and involuntary commitment is discussed again in Chapter 8. Nurses must be aware of all laws and cir- cumstances aecting the commitment. They must maintain the physical and emotional safety of the patient during the time of hospitalization. Condentiality is crucial. Educating the public will be helpful in con- tinuing to eliminate the negative implications of issues surrounding mental illness. Patients' Rights In the 1960s, civil rights was at the forefront. Gaining rights for oppressed people of many backgrounds was actively sought by groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). It was largely due to the eorts of this group that civil rights were addressed for people in prisons and for those warehoused in institutions for the mentally ill. By the 1980s, the Patient Bill of Rights became a requirement for people receiving care in a facility, as well as for the health-care work- ers providing that care. These requirements vary from state to state but are based on federal guidelines and are supported in most states. Agencies in states subscribing to a Patient Bill of Rights are to have the rights listed and displayed in a prominent place in the facility. Patients are to be informed of the implications of their rights and are to be given a copy of the Bill of Rights upon admission to the health- care facility. This also is mandated when care is provided in the home. Table 3-1 lists fre- quently adopted patient rights.42 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Tool Box |Link to Good Samaritan laws in other states: www.heartsafeam.com/pages/faq _ good_ samaritan Involuntary Commitment Each state has its own regulations about people who need to be hospitalized against their will. This action is reserved for people exhibiting behavior that makes them poten- tially dangerous to themselves or to others. The average length of time for involuntary commitment is approximately 48 to 72 hours but could be more or less depending on state law. During this time, the person is observed and examined by the medical and nursing sta. The patient has full ability to exercise his or her rights under the Patient Bill of Rights in that state. At the end of the legal \"hold,\" the patient chooses either to leave or to stay for further treatment. Most of the time, the patient realizes a need for help and stays. Sometimes it is the professional opinion of the treatment team that the patient remains a threat to self or the community but that the patient cannot make the appropriate decision. This then becomes an issue of proving incom- petence and becomes part of the legal system. Voluntary Commitment Most patients who are hospitalized for some type of mental illness are there voluntarily; that is, at some point they realized they needed help. It does not mean they will be happy to be there, of course. There remains a stigma in the United States about being hos- pitalized for problems relating to a person's emotions or behavior. Many times, society assumes that these disorders are weaknesses in character rather than illnesses. It can be2993_Ch03_033-050 14/01/14 5:17 PM Page 42CHAPTER 3|Ethics and Law 43 lTable 3-1 Most Frequently Adopted Patient Rights Patient Right Description Nursing Considerations 1.Treatment in the least restrictive alternative 2.Freedom from restraints and seclusion (except in emergencies) 3.Give or refuse consent for medications/ treatments (including electroconvulsive therapy and psychosurgery) 4.Possess and have access to personal belongings 5.Daily exercise 6.VisitorsPatients are not to be held in any stricter conditions than their behavior or diagnosis warrants. Restraining can be with either physical or chemical restraints. Many areas require specic diagnosis- related restraint orders. All patients have the right to say yes or no to treatments that aect them. This must be informed consent, meaning the patient fully understands the treatment, potential outcomes, and potential eects of refusal. Anything of a per- sonal nature that the patient wishes to remain with him or her must be given to the patient. Patient needs some form of physical activity at least once daily. Patient can visit with anyone he or she chooses.Patients are not to be hospitalized if they can be treated as outpatients and are not to be kept in lockup if not dangerous, and so on. Check the agency protocol and physi- cian's orders for the individual patient. You must still maintain safety for the patient and others. Be aware of the individual's diagnosis and corre- lating orders. Make accurate observations and documenta- tion about the patient's physical and behav- ioral response to restraint. One guideline is to check circulatory func- tion every half hour and to exercise and reposition the patient in restraint at least every 2 hours. Nurses can reinforce the physician's explanation of treatment. Examine the patient's understand- ing; if there is little or no understanding of treat- ment, the nurse needs to have the physician return and explain again to the patient and signicant others. Carefully document any teaching about safety of personal items. If your local laws allow, have the patient sign a waiver of responsibility for personal items. Exercise is according to patient's ability and activity order. Exercise can range from passive range of motion (PROM) to the most strenuous activity the patient can safely perform. Determine at time of intake who will be visiting regularly. In cases of family concern over certain people the patient may wish to visit, safety must be a key issue. At times, nurses may need to monitor visits and visitors. Carefully document the patient's emotional and physical outcome of visits.

Employment compensation 11. Condentiality (records, treatment, and so on) 12. Be informed of these rightsPaper, pencils, pens, and so forth must be available to patients. Mail must not be opened before the patient receives it. Legal access remains intact for anyone who is hospitalized, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. Wages are not to be withheld during hospitalization. Information about the patient is to be kept secure and private. Patients must have full understanding of their civil rights while under facility care.Unless contraindicated for safety reasons, nurses can assist in ensuring that these items are avail- able at all times. If safety is an issue (e.g., stab- bing self or others with a sharp object), this condition needs to be noted in charting. If patient is unable to physically open the mail or if there is concern that cognitively the patient will lose a check, for example, the nurse or another agent of the facility may witness the opening of the mail. Arrangements can be made with a family member or guardian to sign checks or see to the patient's aairs if the patient is unable to do so. Patients can call an attorney at any time. Nurses and agency representatives may be asked to help them. In cases when this seems inappropri- ate, patient, sta, and family can discuss alterna- tives in a family conference. Any outcomes need to be incorporated into the care plan and documented. Under certain legal conditions, compensation may be withheld for reasons other than a stay in a health-care facility. This would be condential information but must be incorporated into the care plan and documentation. Discussion of the patient's condition must take place only in designated places and with desig- nated persons. Many states have cautioned nurses against giving any information regarding the patient over the telephone. In some states, a nurse can be in jeopardy of losing a license for releasing information over the phone. Be careful of the wording in your charting. Release information only to those people who are specically required or legally entitled to have it. The nurse or the facility representative will explain in detail the meaning of these rights for the patient. Depending on your local law and agency policy, the patient may be asked to sign a document stating that these rights have been explained. Usually, a copy is then kept with the patient record and the patient keeps a personal copy.2993_Ch03_033-050 14/01/14 5:17 PM Page 44In addition to these frequently adopted patient rights, some states have adopted a set of patient rights for psychiatric patients. These rights may include the patient's right to: Marry or divorce Sue or be sued Be actively involved in his or her care Be employed if possible Retain licenses (driver's license, license to practice one's profession)a moral, legal, and ethical responsibility to report known or suspected abuse of people who cannot care for themselves. Part of a nurse's scope of practice is to be a voice, or an advocate, for the patients under his or her care. This is the meaning of patient advocacy. Sometimes the nurse is just not sure if abuse is occurring. It is usually better to err on the side of safety for a patient and to report the concern to a supervisor. In most areas, it is acceptable to contact the investi- gating agency directly. Regardless of the pro- cedure a nurse chooses to report his or her concerns, always check the agency's policy and procedure for such reporting and for the documentation that is required. Community Resources According to the provisions of the Commu- nity Mental Health Centers Act, every com- munity oers some form of help to people in need. This help can be in the form of hospital emergency rooms, shelters, crisis centers, or social service oces. Most communities have a list available for the asking. Clinics and hos- pitals provide lists to people who are at risk or who ask for the resources. Depending on the facility's policies, the nurse may be able to help patients choose a community resource to access after discharge. Be sure to provide information on fees for the services provided by the individual agencies. They vary greatly in relation to oered services, fees, and ac- ceptable insurance. Some are free, whereas some provide assistance on a \"sliding scale\" or according to ability to pay. Many states have reduced resources for mental health care in the past two decades, which has contributed to many societal problems as well as frustra- tion for nurses. This situation needs to be addressed. It is important for nurses to iden- tify what resources are available through col- leagues within their agency. If a patient is unaware of community re- sources at the time of discharge, the nurse can suggest that, if the time comes, the patient can nd resources online or in the local phone book. The nurse can also inform the patient that it is always acceptable to call the local hospital to request a list. Shelters for victimsCHAPTER 3|Ethics and Law 45 Clinical Activity Ask one of the nurses on sta: Where are patient les kept? How do you maintain condentiality? Clinical Activity Compare the current year and the year when the Patient Bill of Rights became eective. Inter- view a nurse who was working in the eld prior to the bill's passage and a nurse working after the bill's passage. Determine how the Bill of Rights has aected or changed their interactions with patients.In 1990, the U.S. Congress passed the Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA), which all health-care agencies must follow. PSDA includes the following patient rights: 1.The right to facilitate their own health care decisions 2.The right to accept or refuse medical treatment 3.The right to make an advance health care directive Patient Advocacy With the emergence of the Patient Bill of Rights, patient advocates and patient om- budsmen began speaking out for patients' needs. These individuals are either volunteers within the community or paid workers from an agency whose job is to ensure that patients, especially those considered vulnerable, are being treated in a safe, legal manner. Everyone is responsible for reporting abuse and neglect of those who are considered vul- nerable. Nurses and health-care workers have2993_Ch03_033-050 14/01/14 5:17 PM 45of abuse usually are notadvertised; these are kept condential to maintain safety for the people who need them.46 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Key Concepts 1.It is the nurse's responsibility to know the Code of Ethics and standards of nursing practice for the state in which he or she is practicing. They will vary from state to state. 2.Collaborative practice means working together with all levels of nursing and all ancillary disciplines to provide the best possible care for the patient. 3.Honesty in nursing practice and excel- lence in verbal and written communica- tion are crucial to the care of the patient CASE STUDY 1.What could Nurse P have done to avoid this situation? 2.What are your thoughts about this situation? For the patient? For Nurse P? For the \"fairness\" of the situation? 3.What are your feelings about this situation? 4.What are Nurse P's chances of becoming licensed again? In her state? In another state? What would the situation be if this were your state?1. Nurse P , LPN, had worked for Agency X, a nursing home in a small Midwestern community, for 10 years. Over the years, Nurse P gained the trust and respect of everyone she worked with or cared for on the job. Nurse P's reputation was very good in the community as well. On one particular day, a patient asked Nurse P , \"Go to my purse and get my glasses, would you please?\" This apparently had happened many times before, so Nurse P sensed no reason for concern. Several hours later, afamily member noticed that the patient was missing an amount of cash and a wedding ring, which the patient kept in the purse \"for safe-keeping.\" The patient recalled asking Nurse P to retrieve the glasses from the purse. Other patients and sta had also seen Nurse P in the patient's purse. The case went to small claims court. Nurse P was found guilty and was made to pay restitution. In addition, Nurse P's license to practice nursing in that state was revoked. and to the credibility of the nurse. A nurse will be judged by correct spelling and grammar (American format) in a court case. A nurse's competency can be questioned if his or her spelling and grammar are poor. 4.Cultural considerations such as space, time, waiting, language, and touch (to name a few) are important parts of the nurse-patient relationship. They are also important in the culture of nursing. A nurse's personal beliefs may be dier- ent from the standards that are part of the culture of nurses. 5.The patient's well-being and wishes, the state Nurse Practice Act, and agency policy dictate how nurses can care for the patient in a safe and respectful manner.2993_Ch03_033-050 14/01/14 5:17 PM Page 46REFERENCES Aiken, T.

This chapter covers only the very basics of human development. A sample of the main theorists in the eld of child development is presented, along with others whose theories are applied more in the areas of adult personality develop- ment. For the separate developmental age groups, a chart is shown delineating the general physical and behavioral traits that are com- monly seen in these age groups (pages 64-68).The characteristics may cover beliefs from sev- eral of the individual theorists you will study. 51CHAPTER4 Developmental Psychology Throughout the Life Span Learning Objectives 1.Identify major theories of personality development from newborn through adult development. 2.Identify developmental tasks from prenatal development through death, according to the major theorists. 3.Identify possible outcomes of ineective development, according to the major theorists. 4.Identify the ve stages of grief/death according to K\u00fcbler-Ross.Key Terms Accommodation Assimilation Autonomy Behavior Behavioral theorist Ego Id Lunar month Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Menarche Operant conditioning Psychoanalytic Psychosexual Puberty Superego Unconscious Remember, these are only theories. Many scientic studies have been performed in the specic disci- plines; however, it has yet to be proven that any one is true for every- onein every instance. Each person is unique. Individuals are subjected to dierent factors such as genetics and environment, which may aect development.Neeb's Tip2993_Ch04_051-074 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 51Each person develops at his or her own pace. While reading and learning about these theories, compare them with your personal experiences and observations, as well as with the patient assessments you will be perform- ing. Some theorists may have more validity to you than others.Bear in mind that the life span of young Western Europeans during these years was much shorter than it is today, so that 12 years of age seemed much older than it does by today's standards. One of Freud's main tenets, or beliefs, is that behaviors resulting from ineective per- sonality development are unconscious. He be- lieved that ineective personality development was in some way related to the relationship of the child to the parent and that it was related to what he called psychosexual development. Freud's theories have validity for some people today, but others denounce them. Although the reader is not expected to \"con- vert\" to any of the theories discussed in this text, it is necessary to have a working knowl- edge of the main theories of personality de- velopment. Freud is of particular interest because, in addition to his highly debated ideas, he was the rst to also oer a reasonably organized method of treatment. Because he was the rst publicized theorist, all other the- ories have evolved as a result of his. Sigmund Freud's beliefs surface in almost every topic covered in this text. All other theorists com- pare their theories with Freud's, either in agreement or in opposition. Table 4-1 shows Freud's psychosexual or psychoanalytic stages of development. In- cluded in the table are some of the expected behaviors Freud thought one might witness as a child passes through these ages. The last column lists some behaviors that have been suggested as outcomes of failure to progress through his idea of proper personality devel- opment. Discussion of Freud and his theories continues later in this chapter. Erik Erikson (1902-1994) Erik Erikson (Fig. 4-2) was a psychoanalyst and a follower of Freud. Erikson took Freud's main concepts and expanded them to include nonphysical criteria. Erikson understood that people are individuals and that no matter how young the person, everyone is dierent. Erikson's observations indicated a variable that was dierent from the psychosexual and age- specic theory oered by Freud. That variable is called an emotional component. Table 4-2 shows Erikson's Eight Stages of Development.52 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Figure 4-1 Sigmund Freud.Critical Thinking Question Do other cultures use any of these developmental theories when observing human development? Developmental Theorists: Newborn to Adolescence Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) The theories of Sigmund Freud (Fig. 4-1) are considered controversial in today's world. Sig- mund Freud was an Austrian neurologist. He believed, after observing behaviors of chil- dren, that the personality was developed as early as age 5 years and fully developed by age 12 years. He said that the personality must develop in a certain way and at strictly de- ned ages and that failure to progress in this manner would certainly lead to dysfunction. 2993_Ch04_051-074 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 52CHAPTER 4|Developmental Psychology Throughout the Life Span 53 Frequently, his stages are identied by the words highlighted in the column headed Developmental Tasks. Note that the develop- mental tasks are always listed as contradictions (i.e., trust versus mistrust) of each other. This is one way that Erikson indicated his ideas about emotional fluctuation in people. lTable 4-1 Freud's Stages of Development (Psychoanalytic or Psychosexual Stages) Examples of Stage of Approximate Unsuccessful Development Ages Tasks/Characteristics Task Completion Oral Anal Phallic Latency GenitalBirth-18 months years 3-6 years 6-12 years 12 years- adulthoodUse mouth and tongue to deal with anxiety (e.g., sucking, feeding) Muscle control in bladder, rectum, anus provides sensual pleasure and parent pleasing; toilet training can be a crisis Learn sexual identity and awareness of genital area as source of pleasure; conflict ends as child represses urge and identies with parent Electra Complex: wants boys are dierent from her Oedipus Complex: Son wants mother to himself; father is a rival Quiet stage in sexual develop- ment; learns to socialize Sexual maturity and satisfac- tory relationships with the opposite sexSmoking, alcoholism, obesity, nail biting, drug addiction, diculty trusting Constipation, perfec- tionism, obsessive- compulsive disorder Homosexuality, transsexuality, sexual identity in general, diculty accepting authority Inability to conceptu- alize; lack of motiva- tion in school or job Frigidity, impotence, premature ejaculation, serial marriages, unsatisfactory relationships Classroom Activity Describe which of the following stages you have experienced according to Erik Erikson: Adolescence Young Adult Adulthood MaturityClinical Activity Select an adult patient during your clinical experi- ence, and compare his biological age with Erikson's developmental stages.

Piaget's theory is called2993_Ch04_051-074 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 53according to the expected ability for that organism. Piaget believed that intelligence consists of coping with the environment (Dennis & Hassol, 1983). He believed that a person must complete each stage of develop- ment before he or she can progress to the next stage.

Piaget believed that development was not as much a part of chronological age as of expe- riential age. Piaget was so sure of his ideas that he said they were applicable to any living or- ganism; the catch is to make the observations and comparisons about the cognitive processLawrence Kohlberg (1927-1987) Lawrence Kohlberg (Fig. 4-4) believed in Piaget's theories, but he perceived that very young people have the ability to understand and judge right and wrong. Kohlberg's theory is therefore called the Development of Moral Judgment.2993_Ch04_051-074 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 54CHAPTER 4|Developmental Psychology Throughout 55 Figure 4-3 Jean Piaget. lTable 4-2 Erikson's Eight Stages of Development\u2014cont'd Examples of Approximate Developmental Unsuccessful Task Stage Ages Tasks Examples Completion Adolescence Young Adult Adulthood Maturity12-20 years 18-25 years 21-45 years 45 years- deathIdentity vs. role confusion Intimacy vs. isolation Generativity vs. stagnation Integrity vs. despairRebellion, substance abuse, diculty keep- ing personal to child-play behaviors Emotional immatu- rity; may deny need for personal relationships Inability to show concern for anyone but self Has diculty deal- ing with issues of aging and death; may have feelings of hopelessness Individual integrates life experiences or becomes confused.

Individual accepts own life as fullling; if not, he or she becomes fearful of death. Caution: Morality, the ideas that people consider to be \"right\" and \"wrong,\" is highly cultural.Neeb's Tip Kohlberg was a professor at Harvard Uni- versity for many years. He developed and published his theory of moral development in 1958 as his doctoral thesis. It was based on some of the ideas of Jean Piaget. His true interest was in the mechanisms people use to justify their decisions. Although he was inter- ested in the morality of his subjects, he was especially interested in how people support their decisions. He studied only male subjects ranging in age from 10 to 16 years. Kohlberg's theory is expressed in three levels. Each level has two sections. Table 4-4 shows these stages. Kohlberg believed that these stages build on the learning achieved from the stage before it. Therefore, the stages must be experienced in the exact order, and one is not to back- track, or revert to a previous stage. Part of his belief was that moral development can be promoted via formal education. In fact, there is a mild resurgence of Kohlberg's theory emerging in some classroom environments today. Kohlberg's theory has been criticized2993_Ch04_051-074 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 55on the grounds that it is sexist and culturally biased. It indicates that some cultures and peoples never progress to the highest level and suggests that behaviors that are accept- able in some cultures are \"wrong.\" Kohlberg's theory also does not consider the emotionalresponses that daily problems and stressors can produce. Psychologist Carol Gilligan published a book in 1982 indicating that boys, girls, men, and women are all able to feel compassion and morality but that the genders process their morality from dierent perspectives, a variable that was not consid- ered in Kohlberg's study.56 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing lTable 4-3 Developmental Theory of Jean Piaget Stage Approximate Age Expected Ability Sensorimotor Preoperational Concrete Operational Formal Operations Uses senses to learn about self Schemata develop, which are plans or ways of learning to assimilate and accommodate.

Developmental Theorists: Adolescence to Adulthood Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) In addition to his ve psychosexual stages of development, Sigmund Freud had a model for the components of personality. He said2993_Ch04_051-074 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 56CHAPTER 4|Developmental Psychology Throughout the Life Span 57 lTable 4-4 Lawrence Kohlberg's Theory of Development of Moral Reasoning Why We Should What If We Do Stage \"Right\" Behaviors Do \"Right\" Not Do \"Right\" Level I: Preconventional 1.Punishment and obedience orientation 2.Concerned with having own needs met Level II: Conventional 3. \"Good boy, good girl\" orientation 4.\"Law and order\" Level III: Postconventional ( Principled Level) 5. Social Contact 6. Universal \"good\"I will be punished and I do not like that. I will lose recognition for the importance of \"others.\" Avoiding \"blame\" is more ethical than getting a \"reward.\" \"Law\" will have less importance than the will of \"society.\" May become aware that \"moral\" and \"legal\" may not be the same Few people reach this according to Kohlberg. Therefore, in his own manual, the latest revi- sions do not measure this stage.To avoid punishment and to see what one can \"get away with\" To help me get my needs and wants fullled Self and others think we are \"good.\" It maintains social structure. We blend together for the greatest good and the welfare of all. Live within the universal \"good\" according to own conscience.Do not do it if it will result in punishment. It is \"right\" if I (or if we) get something I want out of it. \"Good\" means living up to what is expected of us. \"Right\" means obeying the laws and rules. \"Right or good\" is behaving accord- ing to a general consensus. Universal rules of justice and equality for all prevail. This is the \"ideal\" accord- ing to Kohlberg. that the personality consists of three parts: the id, the ego, and the superego. Remember that Freud believed that all the components of human behavior are set in the unconscious. The behaviors may appear to be very purpose- ful and deliberate, but in Freud's theories, they are supposedly responses to situations of which people are not aware. Idis the part of the personality that is concerned with the gratication of self. The sayings \"pleasure principle\" or \"if it feels good, do it!\" are attitudes that arose from those who believe that all people have underdeveloped ids. These individuals promote the idea that people need to allow the id to take care of \"me, myself, and I.\" Ego, in Freud's world, had a dierent con- notation from the modern-day common use of the word. Ego, as Freud taught, is the balanceto id. Ego keeps id under control (in a mentally healthy individual) by responding in an unconscious form of a \"now, wait a minute\" attitude. For example, perhaps you had an exam that was in a subject you felt fairly con- dent about, so you chose to study less than you would for other exams. You went partying with friends for the weekend instead. Think about this as id behavior. As you entered the testing area, a gnawing feeling started to enter your consciousness. You sensed \"butterflies\" in the pit of your stomach. You saw the rst question on the exam and your mind went temporarily blank. That is the ego response. It's telling you there are two sides to every situa- tion. In this scenario, the ego is telling the id, \"Hmm. Maybe you aren't quite as condent as you thought you were!\" And the id says, \"This test was made just for me.\"2993_Ch04_051-074 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 57The third part of the personality theory of Sigmund Freud is the superego. The superego could be called the \"killjoy\" of the personality. It is the conscience. It is the part of the per- sonality that allows people to determine what is right, wrong, good, and bad. The values exhibited by the superego are not to be con- fused with the same terms used by Lawrence Kohlberg; according to Freud, having these values is not a matter of choice or of learning. A person who is well-adjusted, or mentally healthy, has all three components of the per- sonality, according to Freud. Freud would expect anyone in whom any of the compo- nents is absent or out of balance to display maladaptive behaviors. Defense mechanisms have been associated strongly with Freud's theories. Discussion of these defense mecha- nisms and maladaptive behaviors is found in later chapters of this book. Karen Horney (1885-1952) Karen Horney (Fig. 4-5) was a psychoanalyst and one of the very few early female theo- rists. Her ideas were very close to those of Freud; however, she believed that the causes of abnormal behaviors or mental illness were related to ineffective mother-child bonding. Karen Horney developed the psychoanalytic social theory where she strongly believed58 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing that a person's childhood contributed and influenced a child's personality in later life. Horney believed that safety and security are important factors in a child's life. Without it in their earlier years, difficult behaviors could be the results. Horney emphasized that it is the responsibility of the parents to provide that safe and secure environment (Dewey, 2007). Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936) and B. F. Skinner (1904-1990) Pavlov and Skinner worked on \"conditioning,\" or manipulating, behaviors. They are called behavioral theorists because they believed that working with dierent behaviors and dierent stimuli could obtain dierent re- sponses. Behavior modication is a direct result of their work. Pavlov (Fig. 4-6) worked on involuntary responses. His well-known study was carried out with dogs, steaks, and a bell. When the dogs saw a choice piece of meat, they salivated in preparation for eating it. Pavlov incorpo- rated the ringing of a bell when the meat was presented so that, in time, the researcher rang Figure 4-5 Karen Horney. Figure 4-6 Ivan Pavlov. 2993_Ch04_051-074 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 58around in and contained an apparatus for the animal to operate voluntarily in response to dierent stimuli. There are three main parts to Skinner's theory: response, stimulus, and reinforcer. Table 4-5 denes these parts. Skinner's theory led to the development of behavior modication. It is possible to \"mod- ify\" or change any behavior by using appro- priate stimuli and reinforcers to obtain the desired behavior. Both positive and negative behaviors can be changed. Today, it is generally believed that positive reinforcing is the most eective way of changing a behavior. Pointing out the pos- itive qualities in a person or patient or focus- ing on the abilities (positive) rather than the disabilities (negative) seems to yield the best results. For instance, pretend that the behav- ior a supervisor wants to operate on is getting a particular coworker to arrive to work on time. The supervisor has two possible paths to follow: One is positive reinforcing; the other, negative reinforcing. EXAMPLES Negative: \"Nurse M, you are routinely late for work. This is very dicult on your patients and on the rest of the sta. One more instance of being late, and you will be red.\" Positive: \"Nurse M, you are still occasionally late for work. I have noticed, however, that you have been late only three times this month. If you continue to improve your timeliness, I will be able to give you a raise at your next review.\"CHAPTER 4|Developmental Psychology Throughout the Life Span 59 the bell and the dogs' association of meat with the sound of the bell stimulated the salivation response. This was a great breakthrough in the study of causes of behavior and ways in which behavior can be manipulated. B. F . Skinner (Fig. 4-7) worked on operant conditioning, which is based on voluntary re- sponses. Operant conditioning, very simply stated, means taking a behavior and operating on it by changing the variables or conditions surrounding the behavior. Skinner is known for the \"Skinner boxes\" in which he kept the animals he studied. These so-called boxes were cages big enough for the animal to move Figure 4-7 B. F . Skinner. lTable 4-5 Operant Conditioning: B. F. Skinner Skinner's Theory Explanation Response Stimulus ReinforcerAny movement or observable behavior that is to be studied . The response is measured for frequency, duration, and intensity (e.g., chicken rings bell in cage). The event that immediately precedes or follows the operant behavior. The object is to nd the stimulus that gets the chicken to ring the bell (e.g., food, noise, boredom). A variable that will cause the operant behavior to repeat predictably or increase in frequency. Sometimes this is called a \"reward.\" The reinforcer has to be meaningful to the person whose behavior is being \"operated\" on (e.g., chicken pecks bell and food drops into tray; when chicken wants food, it knows that pecking the bell will produce food). 2993_Ch04_051-074 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 59The positive reinforcement method seems to give some dignity and positive self-regard to the employee. It allows the employee to understand the consequences and to make choices about being late. It will then be up to the supervisor to follow through with whichever consequences are earned by Nurse M. In the 1960s, positive reinforcement was used with chickens as a form of enter- tainment on New Jersey's Atlantic City boardwalk. Abraham Maslow (1908-1970) Abraham Maslow (Fig. 4-8) is one of a group of theorists described as person-centered, patient-centered, or humanist. Person-centered theories involve observing and treating the whole person. Nursing is highly centered in the person-centered and behaviorist theo- ries. One of the main ideals embraced by the nursing profession is Maslow's Hierar- chy of Needs. This hierarchy, or orderly progression of development, takes in the physical components of personality devel- opment as well as the emotional compo- nents. Self-esteem is a tenet of humanistic psychology. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs has ve lev- els. Maslow said that one must pass through these stages in order and that it is not possible for a person to move up to the next level until the previous level has been mastered. Manytimes this hierarchy is depicted as a large triangle or a staircase to help visualize the pro- gression from the \"basic\" needs to the \"higher\" needs of people (Fig. 4-9). The steps are as follows: 1.Physiological needs 2.Safety and security 3.Love and belonging 4.Self-esteem 5.Self-actualization Physiological Needs These are elements people need to survive: food, water, oxygen, clothing, absence of extremes in temperature, ability for body excretions, and sexual activity. These are con- sidered necessary for life to continue. Without food, clothing, and a shelter that is clean and of a comfortable temperature, an individual could die; without sexual activity, the species could die. The physiological needs can be con- sidered needs for survival. When preparing a plan of care for a patient, if the physiological needs are not categorized as a priority, he/she will not survive. Can the patient proceed to the next level of the hierarchy pyramid with- out water or fluids? Can the patient survive without oxygen? Can the patient survive with- out elimination? These are the questions that a nurse must ask when doing a patient assess- ment. Being able to identify what takes prior- ity can assist the nurse while taking the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) as well as providing patient care. Maslow's theory is an important component of the nursing discipline. Safety and Security It is important that people feel safe and free of fear. When individuals feel comfort- able that their physical needs are being met, they begin to feel a sense of safety that they can maintain their survival. Bear in mind that having these basic needs met does not necessarily mean living in wealth or with steady employment. People who live on the street for whatever reason learn to survive and are proud of their ability to survive in conditions that most people would consider deplorable. For some people, street life is a60 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Figure 4-8 Abraham Maslow. 2993_Ch04_051-074 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 60choice, and they meet the criteria of Maslow's hierarchy. Love and Belonging It is a popular belief within psychology that loneliness is a major cause of depression. Quotes such as \"Man does not live by bread alone\" and \"No man is an island\" have im- plied this for many years, and it is now being borne out scientically. People need to feel loved, appreciated, and part of a group. The opening song in the television comedy \"Cheers\" expresses the importance of every- one knowing each other's name and being happy that you are there. The focus of that sense of love and belonging may change over the life span. For babies and young children, the love needs to come from parents or other caregivers; in adolescence and adulthood, the focus may change to a signicant life partner or a peer group, or both. Regardless of the developmental stage of life, people need to feel loved. Self-Esteem The \"higher\" needs begin with the idea that \"If I am loved by someone, there must besomething special and good about me.\" Find- ing that \"something\" and learning to accept, appreciate, and acknowledge one's positive traits is the goal of the fourth need of Maslow's hierarchy: esteem or self-esteem. Self-esteem is the ability to be condent that one is a person with good qualities and that others know and appreciate these quali- ties. This sounds easier to achieve than it often is. When someone compliments a person on a new piece of clothing, a haircut, or a job well done, what is that person's usual re- sponse? \"Oh, this old thing? Do you really think so? I think it's way too short now\" or \"It was nothing, really\" are responses people often give. In addition to the eect it has on eective communication, responding in this manner does not show positive self-esteem. One of the most dicult things for people to do is to learn to say \"Thank you\" when given a compliment. \"Thank you\" not only ac- knowledges the other person's positive regard for a quality one possesses, but it reinforces to one's \"self\" that \"Yes, I did do that well and I do deserve the recognition.\" Unfortunately, people sometimes interpret this simple re- sponse as \"false pride\" and consider it to beCHAPTER 4|Developmental Psychology Throughout the Life Span 61 (The individual possesses a feeling of self- fulfillment and the realization of his or her highest potential.) (The individual seeks self-respect and respect from others, works to achieve success and recognition in work, and desires prestige from accomplishments.) (Needs are for giving and receiving of affection, companionship, satisfactory interpersonal relationships, and identification with a group.) (Needs at this level are for avoiding harm, maintaining comfort, order, structure, physical safety, freedom from fear, and protection.)SELF- ACTUALIZATION SELF-ESTEEM ESTEEM OF OTHERS LOVE AND BELONGING SAFETY AND SECURITY PHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDS (Basic fundamental needs include food, water, air, sleep, exercise, elimination, shelter, and sexual expression.)Figure 4-9 Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.

Women have been socialized this way for years, and although there has been some improvement over the past 20 years, there is much work yet to be done in this area. Self-Actualization The fth and nal rung on Maslow's hierar- chy ladder is called self-actualization. This means achievement, taking risks, and work- ing to one's individual potential. The self- actualized person is a problem solver. Situa- tions can be creatively dealt with when a person is condent enough to stretch the lim- its of ability. Taking the risk to stretch bound- aries by joining the nursing profession is an example of seeking out self-actualization. Even though it may not feel comfortable yet, it is a process for self-improvement. Gender dierences have been a subject of discussion since the beginning of time. Men and women have always said that they just do not understand each other. Proof of that exists now. Scientists can truthfully, condently, and nonjudgmentally say that \"Yes, there are dierences in the way men and women think, communicate, and process life.\" Psychologist Carol Gilligan studied this phenomenon (Gilligan, 1982). She hypothesized that one of these fundamental dierences appears to aect Maslow's hierarchy: women tend to value relationships as a basic need, and men tend to value achievement as a basic need. This is not an issue of right or wrong; no value statement is being made. It is impor- tant, however, that nurses who are observing and collecting data on their patients under- stand that dierences in patient attitudes and responses to treatment may be related to gender. Carl Rogers (1902-1987) Carl Rogers (Fig. 4-10) was also a person- centered or humanistic psychologist. Al though he believed that all people need to be \"prized and loved,\" his theory is a bit dierent from Maslow's. The phrase associated with Carl Rogers is \"unconditional positive regard.\" Rogers believed that each individual may have dierent ideas about life and the worldhe or she lives in. He did not think it was ap- propriate to put a value on another person's perception of the world, so he said that every person deserved to be treated with respect and \"unconditional positive regard\" just by virtue of being a human being. He also diered from Maslow in the area of self-actualization. Rogers believed that self- actualization is the basic motivator for people and that all people have a built-in desire to achieve their capabilities. Nursing practice is based very strongly in Rogers' theory. His eight steps to being a helping person are listed in Table 4-6. Carl Jung (1875-1961) Although he broke from some of Freud's ideas, Carl Jung (Fig. 4-11), a Swiss psychol- ogist, also believed in the eects of the uncon- scious mind. He included in his denition of \"unconscious\" both repressed personal experiences and representations of universal human experiences, those experiences all people have. He used dierent terminology to describe the various parts of human per- sonality, and he believed that healthy person- alities are a balance between the conscious and the unconscious. \"Self\" to Jung meant the deep, inner part of people. He believed that males and females are dierent organisms Figure 4-10 Carl Rogers. (Courtesy of Bonnie Drumwright, PhD, Gold River, CA.)2993_Ch04_051-074 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 62but that each contains part of the other. The human endocrine system shows that men have traces of female hormones and women have traces of male hormones. To Jung, it log- ically followed that this fact aects the way each person develops his or her personality. Therefore, he used the term \"anima\" to de- scribe the feminine tendencies in men and the term \"animus\" to describe the male character- istics in women. \"Mask\" is a word Jung used to dene the part of the personality that one presents socially. It hints at the idea that one's inner- most self may be dierent from his or her public self.Stages of Human Development Nurses are entrusted with caring for people of all ages. Many nursing program mission statements refer to the concept that nursing must cover a continuum of experiences throughout the life span. It becomes the nurse's responsibility to have a working knowledge of the main physical and behav- ioral changes that can be expected within cer- tain age groups. It is also important to have some idea of the complications that might occur if developmental tasks are not com- pleted successfully. This is called the study of developmental psychology. Table 4-7 identi- es the life stages, some of the expected major physical development, expected behav- ioral development, and possible outcomes of failure to meet certain developmental tasks. This chart incorporates traits from all the theorists identied in this text. It is not a sub- stitute for knowing the concepts of the indi- vidual theorists. Life is an accumulation of experiences. Some of those are positive and some are not. Each person has to deal with gains and losses as he or she travels through life. Patients may be in dierent stages of loss with their illness. Each age group has its own set of gains and losses. Learning to deal with these ups and downs early in life can make the more signicant experiences less dicult to copeCHAPTER 4|Developmental Psychology Throughout the Life Span 63 4-6 Rogers' Eight Steps Empathy \"Walk in another's shoes.\" Respect Care for patient as a person, not just a patient.

Overuse of defense mechanisms (see Chapter 7) can be curtailed with eective stress-management techniques, which can be learned very early in life. It is important for nurses to understand the developmental stages throughout life, and this includes the end of life. The process of death and dying is one that all people will face at some point. Classroom Activity As a class, develop a teaching plan that could be used with children who are experiencing the divorce of their parents. The checklist should be detailed enough to accommodate age-appropriate communication and informa- tion. The class might prefer to do a separate checklist for each developmental group.2993_Ch04_051-074 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 68Death and Dying Losing a loved one at any age or for any reason is a dicult experience. Separation, loss, and grief are human conditions that are unavoid- able. Today's world presents conflicting phe- nomena. People have a better quality of life and better health care than ever before. Because of this, the average life expectancy is 78.7 years (CDC-National Center for Health Statistics). On the other hand, people exist in a fast- paced and competitive society, which causes high levels of stress and encourages people to make unhealthy choices in their diets and lifestyles. This results in people dying of my- ocardial infarctions in their 30s and 40s. Au- tomobile accidents and recreational activities are taking the lives of children at higher num- bers than ever before. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), violence is a global cause of death. Even though people know intellectually that they will die, they often struggle with death as if it is unex- pected. We have been called a \"death-denying society.\" Psychologist Dr. Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross (Fig. 4-12), who died in 2004 at age 78, was a leader in the study of the process of death and dying. She made her reputation by learn- ing about the activities of the mind and body at and around the time of death. Her initial studies were based on only 200 subjects, all of whom had cancer; yet her theory has survived and has spanned more than 40 years.Her idea implies that the end result of expe- riencing the ve stages of grief or dying is the ability to die in peace and with dignity. These stages apply to the dying people and those they leave behind and to other major losses in life. These stages are listed in Table 4-8. Death, and the activities that accompany it for the dying person and those left behind, is not only physiological; it is also deeply rooted in cultural and spiritual tradition. Just as every person is unique in life, so will the rituals surrounding the activities of death be very personal and individual. Dr. K\u00fcbler-Ross emphasized the impor- tance of communicating throughout the dying process. People who are in comas or in the end stage of death may not be able to respond to verbal cues or participate in conversation, but it is widely believed that they continue to hearCHAPTER 4|Developmental Psychology Throughout the Life Span 69 Figure 4-12 Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross.

For this reason, nurses must be careful in talking to the patient and the family, even immediately after the patient's death. Again, people from some cultures and religions believe that the \"spirit\" or \"soul\" remains in the room for a period of time after death. Regardless of the belief sys- tem, it is a sign of respect to the patient and the signicant others to include the patient in the conversation and continue to speak in terms of the reality of the situation.state's recognition of an advance directive or \"living will\" (where the wishes of the dying person are placed on a legal document, signed by the person while competent, and witnessed), and the family's wishes. Advance directives also identify who the decision maker(s) will be if the person is unable to speak for him/herself. Euthanasia (sometimes called \"mercy killing\") is illegal in the United States, but \"physician-assisted suicide\" (also called aid in dying) is now legal in some states. These topics will continue to be debated. Competent adults have the right to decline any medical treatment even if it hastens death. All of these can bring out strong emotions for families and the nurse who is caring for people at the end of their lives. Nurses need to be educated about the ethical and legal considerations around providing end of life care. The nurse's responsibilities at the patient's death vary from state to state. For instance, in some states nurses are allowed to pro- nounce the death of a patient; in other states this must be done only by a physician. Death is dened dierently from state to state. Phys- ical signs such as vital signs, skin color and temperature, presence or absence of activity on electroencephalogram (EEG) and electro- cardiogram (ECG), and the ability to be viable, or to live without mechanical assis- tance, are criteria used by states to dene death. It is the nurse's responsibility to know the legal denition of death in the state in which he or she is working.70 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Dr. K\u00fcbler-Ross' theory also empha- sizes the fact that hearing is the last sense to leave a person before death.Neeb's Tip Children go through the same stages as adults; and as with adults, they may need special help to come to terms with losing a loved one. The help nurses give to younger patients must be age-appropriate. Infants and toddlers may not be able to understand what happened, but they do sense the change. Keep their routine as normal as possible. Pro- vide them with physical closeness and a safe environment. Children from 2 to 6 years of age may have the sense that death is reversible. How often do they see cartoon characters \"die\" and then immediately return to animated life? When the reality that grandmother or grandfather is not coming back to life is understood, it is important that the child understands that he or she did not cause the death of the loved one. Children ages 6 to 12 are at varying degrees of understanding. It is important to allow and encourage children to talk about their feelings. Recent incidents of violence involving this age group have provided the opportunity for grief counselors to intervene with children who have survived the ordeals. Teens are bridging the gap from childhood to adulthood and may respond to grief and loss as an adult at times and then as children. Provide structure, routine, and an environ- ment in which they may freely express their thoughts and feelings. When caring for dying patients, the nurse needs to be aware of the existence of andCritical Thinking Question Your patient is in a monogamous homosexual relationship and is in the final stage of life. Death is imminent, but the patient is still alert and oriented. Family and partner are in the room. The patient asks you to ask the physician to \"put me to sleep.\" The patient's partner weeps but sup- ports the request; the family members threaten to sue if the physician does \"any such thing.\" What are your thoughts and feelings about this request? What will you do to help the patient? The family? The partner? What if this were your parent or child who was about to die? What would you think and feel then?2993_Ch04_051-074 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 70CHAPTER 4|Developmental Psychology Throughout the Life Span 71 Key Concepts 1.There are many theories about personal- ity development in human beings. Although they are only theories, there are strong indications of validity in all of them. The licensed practical nurse (LPN) and the licensed vocational nurse (LVN) must have a working knowledge of some of the more com- monly accepted theories of human development throughout the life span. 2.Dr. Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross developed a theory of ve stages that people go through when they are grieving or dying. Although others have presented theories on this topic, hers remains the most commonly accepted theory in nursing. 3.Each person is an individual and will go through stages of development or grief at his or her own pace. These theories are guidelines to help nurses understand what patients may experience as they go through certain stages in their lives. CASE STUDY 1.What suggestions could a nurse have made to the family of this patient regarding patients who are comatose? 2.How can a nurse help the patient who has concerns about \"memories\" he or she acquired while in a coma (e.g., what is real and what is not, what things might have been said in condence, and so forth)?Mr. Y, a 24-year-old construction worker, suered a traumatic brain injury after falling from scaolding when his safety equipment failed. He was comatose for 8 days. During this time, family and friends kept a constant vigil. His wife was 6 months pregnant and fearful about having to raise the baby alone. Many conversations were held in his room while he was in the coma. When he awakened from the coma, he was able to tell most of what was said. He wondered why \"nobody answered me when I talked to you.\" He especially wanted to reassure his wife that \"Nothing would keep me from seeing that baby!\" REFERENCES Barry, P . D. (2002).

They believe that positive or neg- ative social and cultural experiences early in life result in similar positive or negative behavior and beliefs in adulthood. Culture Culture is a term that is often misused. Cul- ture is a shared way of life, the combination of traditions and beliefs that make a group of people bond together (also see Chapter 3). Culture is not based on one's color of skin or country of origin. For example, in the 1960s, a group of young people who were speaking out against the politics and morals of their parents began living in groups (Fig. 5-1). The area they chose to start this movement was the Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco. They called themselves \"hippies,\" and they shared a way of life that consisted of exper- imenting with drugs; living together with- out being married (or \"free love,\" as it was termed); dressing in ripped, dirty clothing; not cutting their hair; and doing just about everything else that was opposite to the values of the \"older generation.\" This group believed 75CHAPTER5 Sociocultural Influences on Mental Health Learning Objectives 1.Dene culture. 2.Identify factors to consider when assessing culture and ethnicity. 3.Dierentiate between religion and spirituality. 4.Dene ethnicity. 5.Identify parenting styles. 6.Dierentiate between abuse and neglect. 7.Dene stereotype. 8.Dene prejudice. 9.Dene homelessness. 10.

It is important to under- stand people's customs and beliefs to avoid unrealistic expectations of patients.Neeb's Tip Culture and ethnicity are among the topics that are said to have the greatest influence on people throughout their life span.2993_Ch05_075-088 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 75in loving everyone, regardless of race, creed, and color\u2014as long as the individual em- braced the beliefs of the group. The group's symbols were the daisy and the peace sign, and \"flower power\" and \"power to the people\" represented some of the ideals they followed. Much to the chagrin of the over-30 age group, these young people t the denition of a \"culture.\" It was called a \"subculture\" or \"counterculture\" at the time. Today, the \"goth\" statement many youth are making may be equated to the statements of their par- ents or grandparents in the 1960s.A psychoanalyst named Karen Horney (see Chapter 4) proposed the theory that some cultural traditions and beliefs cause disturbances in personal relationships and that this can lead to some forms of emotional disturbances. Today, one can look at other groups who have a shared belief system and a shared way of life. Madeleine Leninger, a nurse theorist, also realized the importance of transcultural nursing. Leninger established the Culture Care Theory. It was while caring for children that she found how their behav- ior needs were related to their culture; with- out understanding each of these cultures, functioning as a health-care provider was dicult (Leininger, 2006)76 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Nurses may discover that when it comes to being knowledgeable about other cultures, they have been living in a glass jar\u2014only seeing other cultures but unaware of how to interact with them.Neeb's Tip Bringing cultural competence to patient care is a primary responsibility of the nurse. Culturally diverse nursing care takes into account the following areas: communication, space, social organization, time, environmen- tal control and biological variation according to the T ranscultural Assessment Model devel- oped by Giger and Davidhizar (Giger, 2013). Culturally diverse care means the nurse is adapting care in a manner congruent with the patient's culture. Figure 5-1 The hippies of the 1960s repre- sented their own unique culture. Tool Box |Transcultural Nursing Assessment Tool www.culturediversity.org/assesmnt.htm Clinical Activity While preparing a care plan for an assigned patient, ask the patient about his or her culture. Determine if any of the patient's traditions or beliefs have been included in the plan of care. Clinical Activity As a class, formulate a list of 10 questions you can use during your clinical experience while doing assessments on someone of a dierent culture or alternative lifestyle. Questions are subject to the instructor's approval. Religious beliefs are often included in dis- cussions of culture; however, it is important to note that the religion is notusually the culture. For people who practice Judaism or Islam, the relationship between their religious beliefs and their cultural beliefs is so entwined that it is hard to separate those traits. However, the hip- pie group mentioned earlier contained people raised in many dierent religions. Religion is the belief in a higher power. This belief system can be very strong\u2014so strong that people have fought wars over religion and even now continue to wage war in the name of religion. Rituals or worship services are usually2993_Ch05_075-088 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 76CHAPTER 5|Sociocultural Influences on Mental Health 77 included in organized religions. Religion is often the subject of stereotype. A stereotype is a xed notion or conviction about a group of people or a situation. Native Americans into one large group; there are many nations and many tribes, each with its own set of beliefs. One belief is that certain numbers are sacred to some Native Americans, and they may attribute special qualities to the four directions of north, south, east, and west. Spirituality and religion are extremely important to some patients and unimportant or nonexistent to others, although both are dierent. Nurses must be comfortable talking to patients about their religious and spiritual needs without pushing personal values on patients. A patient's success at recuperating from an illness or a surgical procedure may be deeply tied to his or her spirituality. Nurses who are not comfortable in these situations should oer to call the chaplain in the facility or a spiritual leader of the patient's choice. Religions involve items considered sacred. Such items may include books (e.g., Bible, Koran), jewelry (brooch, pin, or cross), the person's dress (headwear, loose-tting cloth- ing), or other type of personal eects. It is generally believed that patients should be allowed to keep these items when possible. In situations in which a patient may be in poor mental health and possession of these items is of actual or potential danger to the patient or others in the area, it may be necessary to remove the items. If that becomes necessary, enlisting the assistance of a representative from the particular religion may be helpful. lBox 5-1 Cultural Assessment\u2014Questions to Ask Where was the patient born? If the patient is an immigrant, how long has he or she been in this country? What is the patient's ethnic aliation? How strong is the ethnic identity? Who are the patient's major support people? Does patient live in an ethnic community? Who in the family takes responsibility for health concerns and decisions? Are there any activities in which the patient may decline to participate because of culture or religious taboos? Does the patient have any special food preferences, or food refusals because of culture or religion? What are the patient's primary and secondary languages, and speaking and reading abilities? What is the patient's religion, what is its importance in daily life, and what are current practices? What is the patient's economic situation? Is income adequate for his or her needs? What are the patient's health beliefs and practices? What are the patient's perceptions of the health problems and expectations of health care? Source: Gorman and Sultan (2008). Psychosocial Nursing for General Patient Care, 3rd ed. Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company. Critical Thinking Question Your patient is from a dierent country and speaks only minimal English. Your translator has seen the patient and has gone over the hospital routines, rules, and patient's rights. The patient's mother insists on staying in the room 24 hours a day and refuses to let you perform assessments and care for the patient. The patient is in pain, but the mother will not allow pain medication to be given. The patient will not accept the food from the hospital. You smell food cooking and enter the room to nd the mother cooking on a hot plate, which is a re code violation. What can you do in this situation? Classroom Activity Interview a person whose religion is different from your own. You may use the interview format from Chapter 6. Present the interview results orally or in writing to the class. Discuss what you thought you knew about the religion prior to the interview. Discuss what you learned after the interview. Review literature on that specific religion and compare the information from the interview. Native Americans are an example of a group that worships dierent gods or spirits. Of course, it is improper to categorize all 2993_Ch05_075-088 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 77perfect position to teach and model inter- personal relationships and, it is hoped, to make great strides in eliminating prejudg- ment of others. Health care may not be completely free of guilt in the area of race. A study was con- ducted at Emory University School of Med- icine in Atlanta, Georgia (Todd et al., 2000). For 40 months, researchers studied 217 patients who sought treatment for long bone fractures. Of these patients, 127 were black and 90 were white. Patients with this type of fracture usually require some type of pain medication. The study showed that, even though the injuries and pain levels were similar, 43% of the black patients received no pain medication, compared to 26% of white patients. The study could not deter- mine the exact rationale for the outcome. Did some patients refuse medication? Did some not ask? Was it a cultural choice? Did medical staff make assumptions about drug misuse in some people? Nurses should be wary of statistics and be careful about silent stereotypes.78 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Ethnicity Ethnicity denes one's more personal traits and identies a person with his or her shared heritage. Language, country of origin, and skin color are parts of one's ethnicity. There can be dierent ethnic groups within a cul- ture. For example, a blonde, blue-eyed woman exhibits physical characteristics of her ethnic background. However, these characteristics say little about her culture; that would require speaking to her and obtaining some informa- tion. People are generally very proud of their culture and ethnicity. Many communities have festivals that celebrate their dierent cultures and ethnic groups. These festivals do much to educate the community about the various people living together in it. Some- times one can learn a lot about a group of people from the kind of food they eat, and these celebrations are usually overflowing with foods of the particular group.

Describe the following traditions for your religion or culture: Foods Music Weddings Death practices Myths Education can help eliminate prej- udice, which is judging a person or situation before all the facts are known. Prejudice is a destructive behavior; it is hurtful and it shuts the door on the enrichment of the society.Neeb's Tip Laws in the United States are intended to minimize displays of prejudice relating to race, creed, gender, age, and so on. Unfor- tunately, it is impossible to legislate the beliefs of individual people. Nurses are in aThe hurt of prejudice has led to an emer- gence of ethnocentrism, which is when people believe that their particular ethnic or religious group has rights and benets over and above those of others. Gangs, supremacist groups, and terrorist groups may have had their roots in hate and prejudice. Sadly, society is reminded of the plight of the Jewish people, who lived through the horror of concentration camps. The United States shows the scars of the inhumane treat- ment of the African and African American people, who have been ghting for their civil rights for over 200 years. And it remains a topic of debate today. The validity of arma- tive action is being questioned and, in fact, being called by some a form of discrimination against other people. In 2008 the citizens ofCritical Thinking Question Should a patient's identication bracelet specify if the patient has insurance coverage? If the patient does not have any coverage, will the care be the same as if the patient had coverage?2993_Ch05_075-088 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 78CHAPTER 5|Sociocultural Influences on Mental Health 79 the United States elected their rst African American president, which gave many hope that some social scars will heal. Religion, cul- ture, and ethnicity, as well as prejudice caused by any of those characteristics, are personal and deeply felt by members of the respective groups. It is important to keep the lines of communication open. People learn by sharing with each other, so it is much better to ask a person about something than to make an assumption about it. Making such an assump- tion is stereotyping, which can end a helping relationship between nurse and patient. Many mental health professionals believe that people raised in an atmosphere of preju- dice and stereotype tend to become angry, hateful, and aggressive adults. There is no proof that all people who are subjected to prejudice and stereotype develop into adults with such negative attitudes. This is one of the dangers in reading statistics on these topics: Statistics can be very misleading and can in fact support the negative stereotypes. Nontraditional Lifestyles The denition of \"family\" is changing (Fig. 5-2). Gay marriage and civil unions have opened very active debates. In June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Count knocked down the Defense of Marriage Act to pave the way for federal recognition of same sex marriages. Same-sex marriages are now legal in many states. It is becoming more common in schools and clinics for children to have \"two mommies\" or \"two daddies.\" People transgender (LGBT) lifestyles are \"out\" in the open and living life as normally as the more traditional father/ mother/children families of decades earlier. All age groups are aected. However, despite signs of increased acceptance, LGBT individuals as well as their families may still struggle with facing being \"dierent.\" People have been leading dierent lifestyles all along but were far less comfortable profess- ing it in years past. Aging happens to all, regardless of lifestyle preference. By the year 2030, according to the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, there will be approxi- mately four million gay elders requiring social services and living in long-term care facilities. How will that change the way nurses provide care? Overtly, probably very little; good nursing care will remain good nursing care. However, nurses may need to learn to alter their communication style to ask for and accept people's preferences for roommate, type of clothing to wear, or activities to attend. Activities may cross gender barriers in a dierent way than they do today. Who shares bathrooms may become a dierent pri- ority. Clearly, in the not too distant future, nurses practicing in clinics and long-term care or assisted living facilities can expect some changes in the clientele as well as the way in which those people will require assistance. Additionally, more individuals are choos- ing to start and raise families as single parents. Parents are adopting children from other countries, other ethnicities, and other races. One family may now include parents and sib- lings with assorted skin tones and languages. The global family is rapidly and constantly evolving. Classroom Activity Interview a person who is from a culture dier- ent from your own. You may use the interview format from Chapter 6. Present the results orally or in writing. This will reinforce the information presented in Chapter 6, as well as provide rst- hand information pertinent to this chapter. lBox 5-2 Enhancing Cultural Sensitivity Know your own attitudes, values, and beliefs. Be aware of your own ethnocentrism. Be aware of your own prejudices that may influence your assessment. Maintain an open mind and seek out more information about your patient's culture, beliefs, and values. Communicate your interest about the patient's beliefs and values. Approach the patient as an individual. Avoid assuming that all people from one cultural background hold the same beliefs. Source: Gorman and Sultan (2008).

It receives brief mention in this text because many of the people in the United States who are homeless also have some threat to their mental health. The picture of the homeless population is as varied as those who have homes. Some people are working full-time but are homeless. They might be victims of the economy, foreclosures, or other situations not related in any way to having a mental illness. Since 2008, tent cities have appeared across America (Fig. 5-4). A small number of people choose to live on the streets. Others have been forced to live on the street or in a shelter as a result of forces out of their control. Many more of the homeless are suering from a variety of mental illnesses. Some people are homeless as an indirect result of the health- care delivery system. Approximately one-third of the homeless population in the United States is mentally ill, with many more having substance abuse issues (Mental Health Asso - ciation of Colorado). The rise in homelessnessis linked to the rising cost of rental housing and poverty (National Coalition for the Homeless, 2009). Because of the diagnosis, the availability of benets for the mentally ill, and the nature of the illnesses, people with certain illnesses have a dicult time trying to live independ- ently with their illness. They end up out of work, out of money, and out of a home. They may be noncompliant with their medications, have no access to getting rells, lose the med- ication, or have it stolen on the streets. A large number of people who use community-based mental health services are the poor, especially the homeless poor (Barry, 2002). T ragically, many of the homeless are also veterans. Serv- ices are available through Veterans Aairs, but the person may have challenges in how to access them. Figure 5-4 Tent city for the homeless in Camden, New Jersey. (Courtesy of Robynn Anwar.)

How long can you survive with no income? How will you pay for insurance? Jobs are not plen- tiful; the outlook for comparable employment in the near future is bleak. How close are you to living on the street? What will be the plan of action for you and your family? In the 1950s, deinstitutionalization led to the discharging of people who were techni- cally able to be \"in the community\" but who were not always able to cope with the stresses of caring for themselves, caring for their families, and maintaining employment. For2993_Ch05_075-088 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 81some mentally ill people, this kind of pressure and competition is the factor that keeps them ill. The Urban Institute Study of 2000 estimates there are approximately 3.5 million people annually who are homeless. Approximately one-third of those are children (Box 5-3.) In 1987, the Health Resources and Ser - vices Administration-Health Care for the Homeless (HRSA-HCH) was formed to pro- vide information and help create plans to help the homeless. The problem is that funding of federal programs depends on statistics, and it is extremely dicult to get accurate numbers because they change markedly approximately every 2 months (Society Magazine, 1994). Patients may be brought to a facility through the emergency department or by a law enforce- ment agency. Sometimes medication is given to stabilize the patient, and he or she is returned to the community; other times the patient is admitted to a medical unit. Unfortunately, sometimes the mental health issue is overlooked because of the health-care provider's focus being on physical health.82 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Shelters of varying types exist in many cities. They are funded and staed in dierent ways. For example, some are church funded and some rely on grants and underwriting by large businesses. Some are completely oper- ated by volunteers and some have some paid sta. Depending on the resources available, shelters for homeless people provide anything from meals and overnight shelter to health care, dental care, and assistance with job placement. Often, however, behavioral conditions exist in such shelters. Homeless people may be required to stay drug- and alcohol-free and to show proof that they are compliant with med- ications or some other criteria to help them return to an improved lifestyle. What techniques do nurses need to help patients who may be homeless and physically or mentally compromised? 1.T reat the whole person, not the homelessness. 2.T reat the person as any other patient. 3.Maintain all patient rights. Economic Considerations A study by Eron and Peterson in 1982 found that the lower the socioeconomic status, the higher the incidence of abnormal behavior in U.S. society. That statement, however, is not completely accurate. The study showed that the statement applies more strongly to patients with schizophrenia than it does to those with mood disorders. The implication is that there are always other variables besides socioeconomic status. For example, people who live in poverty or underprivi- leged circumstances will very likely have greater stressors than will people of higher socioeconomic status. So, is it the lack of money or increased stress that leads to the disorder? Such questions make it very diffi- cult, if not impossible, to make absolute statements about the correlation between disease and any variable. Behaviorists em- phasize that people always have a choice. If the foregoing statements about poverty and illness were completely true, then it would follow that all people in that same circum- stance would be mentally ill. lBox 5-3 Homeless in America.

That means all the cultural and religious values that have been planted in one parent's belief systems are brought out in the open and blended with those values from the other parent's upbringing. Then, it is up to the parents to take one day at a time and learn from their mistakes. Sometimes parent- ing is learned from friends and neighbors. Sometimes schools, health-care facilities, and communities oer classes for parents.CHAPTER 5|Sociocultural Influences on Mental Health 83 However, this is simply not the case. What variable causes some people to be ill and others not to be ill? Is it choice? Is it genetic? Is it learned behavior? This is part of the intrigue of the study of the mind. Abuse Abuse is misuse of a person, substance, or situation. Sometimes people say that they cannot be abusing because they know what they are doing. This is not true. Anyone who misuses or overuses a person, a substance, or a situation (such as gambling or power) is displaying abusive behavior. Some individual forms of abuse are dis- cussed in Chapter 22. Abuse in general is a growing phenomenon in society. People de- bate about whether a higher incidence of abuse exists now or whether people are just talking about it more openly. Violence is a learned behavior. It is well documented that in the majority of physical abuse situations, the abuser was abused at some point. When it comes to substance abuse, the ndings are not quite as conclusive. Some studies indicate that this type of abuse may be genetic, learned, or possibly due to a chemical imbalance in the body. A phenom- enon called the \"addictive personality\" is dened as grouping abuse disorders together. It is important for nurses to understand that there may be more than one cause for a particular mental health problem. Good communication and data-collecting skills will help the nurse nd potential causes for each patient's mental health problem. Poor Parenting What is a \"good\" parent? Is it the parent who lets the child do anything the child wants? Is it the parent who buys all the newest fads for the child? Is it the parent who teaches strict values and ethics? Maybe it is the parent who is with the child at all times. Parenting is the method of raising children that is used by par- ents or other primary caregivers. Parenting is a learned behavior; it is not an innate skill. So, how do parents learn to be parents? Typically, one tends to parent based on the way he or sheCritical Thinking Question You are home one evening and you hear the 18-month-old child of your upstairs neighbors. The child has been crying for 3 hours. You have heard no footsteps in the apartment. The answer- ing machine picks up each time you attempt to call. You become concerned and call the building supervisor to open the apartment. When you get in, you nd unsanitary conditions, and the parents are not in the apartment. You look outside and see the parents several apartments down, party- ing with friends. What are your responsibilities? How will you respond to the parents? Whom will you notify? The parents tell you to mind your own business. What will you say to them? What will you do if it happens again? Reactions to altered parenting styles are varied. Again, there is no \"perfect\" situation or guarantee of being \"good\" parents. Parent- ing is stressful. No matter what patients are concerned about during their hospitalization, it is almost certain that their children will be a paramount focus of attention. Nurses can help parents not only through the stress of being hospitalized and apart from their chil- dren, but also with the stresses of parenting in general by helping parents choose healthy lifestyles. Good nutrition, moderate exercise, and \"adult time\" apart from the children can be eective stress relievers. Diana Baumrind (1971) has classied three dierent types of parents. They are described as follows: 1.Authoritarian parent: This parent sets up very strict rules. The child has little or no voice in family decisions. This style of parenting is evidenced by novelty clothing imprinted with the saying, \"Because I'm the Mommy/Daddy, that's why!\" This authoritarianism can lead 2993_Ch05_075-088 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 83to a rebellious, hostile child who may enter adulthood angry, violent, unwill- ing to obey laws, and unable to make consistent decisions. 2.Authoritative parent: This style of parenting has rm, consistent rules and limits, while allowing for discussion and occasional flex- ibility of those rules according to special circumstances. Children are allowed some freedom, within set limits, and some voice in decisions. Researchers think that this is the preferred style of parenting. It oers a balance between rules and responsibilities, which allows the child to learn to make appropriate choices and accept the out- comes of those choices. 3.Permissive parent: This is the type of parent many adolescents wish they had. This style of parenting provides little structure and few guidelines. The child is not sure of his or her boundaries. If one does not learn boundaries, it be- comes difficult to learn how to control oneself and how to behave in certain situations. Permissive parents can be in danger of being accused of neglect. The parent acts as the child's friend rather than the parent of the child.84 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Clinical Activity Choose someone you know who is a parent. This can be a family member, friend, neighbor, or anyone you feel comfortable with. Using the parenting definitions of Diana Baumrind, iden- tify what basic parenting style you think this parent uses. Key Concepts 1.Culture, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and religion are deeply rooted human experiences. They are not \"good\" or \"bad\"; they are different for each indi- vidual or group of individuals who claim membership in that culture, ethnic group, or religion. 2.People have many more similarities than they have dierences. It is important for nurses to concentrate on the similarities among people and to be comfortable asking questions about the background of their patients and coworkers. Role modeling cooperative relationships can be very helpful in teaching others about cultural sensitivity. CASE STUDY 1.Considering Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, how would you classify Harold? 2. What are the arguments both for and against his decision to leave the nursing home? 3.Do you consider Harold to be mentally healthy and competent? Why or why not?Harold is a 76-year-old nursing home resident. He has type 1 diabetes and gives himself his own insulin. He has the diagno- sis of paranoid schizophrenia but has been asymptomatic for 1 year. Harold is also a severe alcoholic, and he periodically leaves the nursing home against medical advice and is gone for 2 to 3 days. He has friends \"on the street\" because, before being insti- tutionalized, that is where he lived. Harold goes to the local shelter for meals and knows he can go to the hospital to get his insulin. He has no family in the vicinitywho can participate in his care. He no longer meets the criteria for skilled-care nursing. A decision must be made about his future, as he will no longer be eligible to remain in this nursing home. Harold wishes to be his own advocate and is found to be legally capable of making his own decisions. The outcome for this patient is that he chooses to \"take my chances\" and return to the streets. He has not been seen again by any of the nursing home sta. No further information is available about this patient.2993_Ch05_075-088 14/01/14 5:18 PM Page 84REFERENCES Barry, P .D. (2002).

The nursing process is a formula for nurses to provide individual patient care and learn how to organize and implement that care in a systematic, universal way. The nursing process also allows the nurse to determine if the plan and interventions produce a favorable outcome for the patient. In preparing to care for the patient with the use of the nursing process, the nurse will need to incorporate critical thinking to arrive at the planned outcome. It is part of the culture of nurses to be part of a positive outcome. Scope of practice, determines that the reg- istered nurse (RN) and the licensed practical 89CHAPTER6 Nursing Process in Mental Health Learning Objectives 1.Dene the role of the LPN/LVN in the ve steps of the nursing process. 2.Identify the components of a mental health status assessment. 3.State the need for the nursing process in mental health issues. 4.State the concepts of patient interviewing. 5.Prepare a patient interview. 6.Collaborate in creating a nursing process for a given, hypo- thetical patient. 7.State the concepts of patient teaching. 8.Prepare and implement a teaching exercise.Key Terms Aect Awareness Data collection Evaluation Formal teaching Implementation Informal teaching Judgment Memory Mood North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) Nursing diagnosis Nursing Interventions Classication (NIC) Nursing Outcomes Classication (NOC) Nursing process Orientation Patient interview Patient teaching Plan of care Scope of practice Subjective Thinking/cognition 2993_Ch06_089-104 14/01/14 5:19 PM Page 89Figure 6-1 Steps nursing process. nurse/licensed vocational nurse (LPN/LVN) play dierent roles in the nursing process. In the early 1950s, Hildegard Peplau (Chapter 1) hypothesized that nurses are a tool best utilized in relationship to the patient and the environment and in collaboration with other nurses and health-care professionals. She stressed the phases of a working relationship that included a termination phase where nurses prepare both themselves and their patients for termination of the relationship. Her model is still widely used in nursing process and nursing practice today.best choices concerning that person. Nurses collect data about the patient and his or her condition. In most cases, this is accomplished with the help of a form that is used by the facility. Nurses also use nonverbal communi- cation skills to assess the patient's attitude, tone of voice, facial expression, and so on. The problem with many of these generic forms is that they are written in closed-ended format. They are very impersonal and may not reflect the specic information needed about that patient. It is during the data collection/assessment part of the nursing process that the mental sta- tus exam is performed. The mental status exam is a series of questions and activities that check eight areas: the patient's (1) level of awareness andorientation, (2) appearance and behavior, (3) speech and communication, (4) mood and aect, (5) memory, (6) thinking/cognition, (7) perception, and (8) judgment. These examinations are of varying lengths and formats, but they all assess the patient's mental capabilities. Table 6-1 lists areas to be included in a mental status examination. It also suggests the type of assessment made and ideas for ques- tions or commands used by members of the health-care team to make the assessments, as well as some parameters for responses of a person with normal and abnormal mental functioning.90 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing AssessmentNursing diagnosisPlanning Intervention Evaluation LPNs/LVNs should know and under- stand their scope of practice in order to provide safe and eective health care.Neeb's Tip In the early 1970s, the American Nurses Association (ANA) developed Standards of Practice for RN and LPN/LVN prepared nurses. The association dierentiated between the RN's role and the LPN's role in the nursing process. Individual state Nurse Practice Acts and Boards of Nursing may also oer their own interpretation of the ANA guidelines relating to the role and scope of practice for the LPN/LVN prepared nurse in the nursing process. The following provides step-by-step implementation of the nursing process. Step 1: Assessing the Patient's Mental Health Assessment is the rst step in the nursing process. The role of the LPN/LVN in Step 1 is to assist with the assessment. The registered nurse is responsible for the initial assessment when the patient is admitted or transferred in a facility. Data collection is made during every contact a nurse has with a patient. It is essential to the well-being of the patient and in assisting the medical team in making theTool Box |Mental Health Status Examina- tions Components www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/N BK 320/ There are many ways to improve the quality of data collection.

There is usually a standard guide- line for helping with this assess- ment, but subjective observations can be documented as well, if the patient cannot stay awake for even short intervals or is overly active and has diculty staying in one place for any period of time. Orientation measures the person's ability to know who he or she is, where he or she is, and the day and time, usually within 1 or 2 days of the actual day and time. Measurement techniques are accomplished by asking the patient, \"What is your name?\" \"Where are you right now?\" and \"Tell me what the day and date are.\" Asking \"Who is the president of the United States?\" is used here as well. Nurses frequently document this as \"oriented \u00d7 3,\" but it is best to also write down the objective data on which this routine answer is based.Displays either unusual apathy or concern about appearance.

Objective and subjective as- sessment of as- pects of patient's use of verbal and nonverbal communication.Formal testing may be undertaken by the psychologist or psychiatrist to determine the patient's general thought content and pattern. Nurses may contribute to the assessment of thought by docu- menting statements the patient makes regarding daily cares and routines. Recent memory: Recall of events that are immediately past or up to within 2 weeks before the assess- ment. One measurement tech- nique is to verbally list ve items. After 1 minute, patient should be able to recall 4-5 of those items. Continue with assessment and at 5 minutes, patient should be able to recall 3-4 of the items. Remote memory: Recall of events of the past beyond 2 weeks prior to assessment. Patients are often asked questions pertaining to where they were born, where they went to grade school, and so on. Patient can coherently produce words appropriate to age and education. Rate of speech reflects other psychomotor activity (e.g., faster if patient is agitated). Volume is not too soft or too loud. Stuttering, repetition of words, and words that the patient \"makes up\" (neologisms) are also assessed.Behaviors including flight of ideas, loose associations, phobias, delusions, and obses- sions may become apparent. These alterations in \"normal\" thought processes are dened and discussed in future chapters that relate to specic illnesses. Inability to accurately perform recent or remote recall exer- cises within parame- ters; may indicate symptoms of delirium or dementia.

Aect measures the outward expression of those feelings. Subjective assessment of a patient's ability to make appro- priate decisions about his or her situation or to understand concepts. Assesses the way a person experi- ences reality. Assessment is based on the patient's state- ments about his or her environ- ment and the behaviors associ- ated with those statements. Nurses and health-team members must document this often-subjective information in objective terms.Mood is the stated emotional condition of the patient and should fluctuate to reflect situa- tions as they occur. Facial expression and body lan- guage (aect) should match (be congruent with) stated mood. Aect should change to fluctuate with the changes in mood. Give patient a \"proverb\" to inter- pret, such as \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks.\" Patient should be able to give some sort of acceptable interpretation such as \"old habits are hard to break\" or \"it is hard to learn something new.\" Orgive the patient a situation to solve (judgement). For example, ask the patient what he or she would do if a small child were lost in a store. An appropri- ate response might be \"to call the manager\" or \"to try to calm the child.\" All ve senses are monitored for interaction with the patient's reality. Patient's insight into his or her condition is also assessed.Mood and aect do not match (e.g., facial expression does not change when stating opposite feelings). Patient cannot inter- pret the sayings in an acceptable manner. Patient cannot complete problem- solving questions appropriately. The patient might answer very literally, \"Dogs can't learn anything when they get old\" or \"I would go through the child's pockets to see if there were any phone numbers in them.\" Presence of halluci- nations and illusions. These are discussed further in Chapter 15. Individuals who are not within normal boundaries of judg- ment or insight will not be able to state understanding of the origin of the illness and the behaviors associated with it.2993_Ch06_089-104 14/01/14 5:19 PM Page 9394 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing word interview pertains to any nurse-patient interaction that requires a nurse to obtain specific information from a patient. The patient interview is usually the primary method of data gathering. It is important to collect data about the whole person. Data related to thoughts and feelings are as im- portant to any nurse-patient interview as the physical data collected. profitable experience for both the nurse and the patient. 2. Helping Interview The helping interview is used to determine or isolate a particular concern of the patient and to help the patient learn to help herself or himself (Fig. 6-2). Patients may trust nurses because nurses have built a rapport with them and are usually more easily accessible than physicians. It is always important to remem- ber, though, not to help to the point of inter- fering with the patient's ability to help herself or himself. Consider a situation in which the patient is not progressing according to a \"normal\" post- operative course. The nurse notices the patient weeping and senses that a need is not being met. The nurse can use this opportunity and observation to begin obtaining information1. Intake/Admission Interview Most facilities have developed standard in- terview forms that suit their particular needs. The forms are written in a very matter-of-fact way and are usually in a closed-ended format (Chapter 2). Patients who are frightened, angry, or just too ill at the moment may easily refuse to answer those closed-ended questions. The patient may have heard the questions before and feel frustrated by what he or she perceives to be inefficiency or poor communication among the staff when the same questions are repeated. This can set up both the nurse and the patient for a difficult time. It is up to the nurse to rephrase the questions in an open-ended format that will seem more individualized to the patient. EXAMPLE Standard form: \"Do you smoke or NO.\" Nurse interviewer: \"I am required to provide you with information about the hospital's policies on the use of tobacco and alcohol.\" This statement might then be followed by the standard closed-ended question, \"Do you use any tobacco or alcohol?\" Questions can be changed from the closed-ended type to open-ended in most cases. Practice and patience on the part of the nurse interviewer will make this a more Classroom Activity Group activity: Discuss the normal parameters presented and your perception of what is normal in light of the mental health status examination.Critical Thinking Question Pick a student partner to interview. Select any topic and develop a 5-minute interview. Write it twice: once with only closed-ended questions and aggressive statements, and once with only open-ended questions and assertive statements. Compare the two versions. How was it dierent as the interviewer and how was it dierent for the interviewee?

Guidelines for Nurse-Patient Helping Interview 1.Be honest: Tell the patient the purpose of the interview. 2.Be assertive: If the interview is mandatory (e.g., intake, preoperative), the patient must understand that it is required. Contract for a mutually acceptable time to conduct the interview so that the pa- tient will be aware of the time involved. 3.Be sensitive: Sometimes the questions are very dicult or embarrassing for the pa- tient to answer. The nurse should assure the patient that he or she understands the patient's feelings and that the information shared by the patient is part of the pa- tient's medical record. Only the patient, the patient's designee, and people who are involved in his or her caregiving will have access to this information. 4.Use empathy: The nurse should let the patient know that he or she is interested in what is being said and that the nurse is there to be helpful. Acknowledge the patient's feelings but do not judge the patient. 5.Use open-ended questions: Personalize the questions as much as possible. Use this time to discuss and clarify as much infor- mation as you can to avoid having to repeat parts of the interview later. Step 2: Nursing Diagnosis: Defining Patient Problems Processing the collected data is a function of the registered nurse, according to the ANA. Once data is collected, nursing diagnoses are identied. Nursing diagnoses are a universal language on which the interventions are based. There are dierent models or theories of nursing diagnosis that may be used and recommended by your work setting. These include nursing diagnoses published by the North American Nursing Diagnosis Asso- ciation (NANDA).It is the registered nurse's responsibility to assimilate the data that has been collected and choose one or more potential nursing diagnoses for the patient. The LPN/LVN needs to understand the function of the nursing diagnosis. In collaborative nursing practice, LPN/LVNs can make suggestions and oer rationales to the RN that may be incorporated into the patient's plan of care. An emerging format for writing a diagnos- tic statement for a patient's plan of care is the P .E.S. Model. The components of this model are: P , the problem or need; E, the etiology or cause; and S, the signs, symptoms, or risk fac- tors. The nurse blends these components into a \"neutral\" statement that avoids value-laden or judgmental language. The nursing diagno- sis is not a medical diagnosis as used by physi- cians. Rather it is a common language among nurses to help clarify the patient's needs (see Appendix E, Assigning Nursing Diagnoses to Client Behaviors). Step 3: Planning (Short- and Long-Term Goals) The LPN/LVN role is again as a partner in care planning. The ANA believes that the RN has the primary responsibility for this step of the nursing process. Planning care involves setting short-term and long-term goals from the patient's perspective, not from the nurse's perspective. It is for this reason that the patient and signicant others must be in- volved in the plan of care. Recovery will hap- pen much more quickly if the patient plays an active role in decision making and does not have the impression that treatment is being done to or forhim or her but rather collaboratively with the person. Prioritizing the goals is the second part of planning care. This is one area in which the patient and the nurse might not see things the same way. Nurses and patients look at the same problem from two dierent perspec- tives, and the PM the nurse's priority. Whenever possible, the patient's priority should be considered. When there is a threat to life or health that is a direct response to the patient's priority, however, the nurse must intervene and explain the reason that the patient's wishes will have to wait a while. The aim of selecting goals that will im- prove mental health status is to keep the mind-body connection intact. It is estimated that about 95% of physical healing is related to a positive mental attitude (PMA). It will be of great help to the patient if the nurse is able to detect alterations in that mental attitude and set goals with the patient to maintain the best outlook and strongest pos- sible eective coping skills. In planning the patient's goals, there should be a short-term and long-term goal for the patient. Both goals should be realistic and measurable with a tar- get date for them to be completed. Step 4: Implementations/ Interventions The LPN's role is to assist with identifying and carrying out the specic steps that will help the patient reach the goals. Nurses are able to provide input about new interven- tions that may be helpful, and the LPN/LVN is often the person who begins to help adapt certain procedures to assist the patient. A nurse may use this opportunity to conduct some new patient teaching or to reinforce96 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing prior teaching. Relaying information about implementation (putting the care plan into action) and patient progress to the RN will provide the information the team needs to oer the best possible care for the patient. Nurses also need to understand and specify the rationale (reason) for the implementa- tions that are selected and be prepared to ex- plain them to patients and families provided the patient consents to their involvement. Table 6-2 provides information about the nursing process. States dier in the role the LPN plays in outcome statements or performing an evalu- ation of interventions. In much the same way NANDA developed problem or nursing diagnostic standards, work is being done to standardize outcome statements. Nursing Interventions Classication (NIC) is a com- prehensive standardized language. It provides a number of direct and indirect intervention labels with denitions and possible nursing actions. The interventions address general practice and specialty areas (Doenges and Moorhouse, 2003). Clinical Activity If your clinical aliates will allow, arrange to shadow a nurse from the mental health unit. Write a sum- mary of the following experience: Observations of the nurse-patient relationship Communication style Understanding Patient responses lTable 6-2 The Nursing Process Nursing Diagnosis Implementation/ Assessment (NANDA) Planning Intervention Evaluation Subjective/ ObjectiveRelates to the assess- ment data to deter- mine how the nurse will plan for the care needed.

Even with standardized teaching tools, nurses still need to be aware of some principles of teach- ing and learning. Nurses have an advantage in teaching because, with the exception of nursing diagnosis, the same format they learned for nursing process can be used for setting up a teaching plan. Teaching in any form is most eective when it is started as soon as possible after admission. Nurses teach patients in dierent ways. Teaching falls under the categories of either formal teaching or informal teaching. Formal teaching is any situation in which a class is scheduled or a specic objective must be met. The instructor is often a sta nurse who has worked in the specic area being taught. Formal teaching involves a nurse instructor and one or more patients. Usually a preset curriculum is used in these classes. The time to teach in the formal set- ting will most likely be limited by the facility according to stang needs, because the nurse instructor probably also has a patient assign- ment. Examples of formal teaching include diabetic teaching and back-care classes.CHAPTER 6|Nursing Process in Mental Health 97 Patient Teaching Many implementations or interventions that are helpful to the patient involve patient teaching. Frequently, facilities have special teams or departments to carry out certain teaching (e.g., diabetes education), but teaching is becoming a bigger part of a nurse's respon- sibility. This is true at all levels of nursing preparation. The doctor is still responsible for the initial information given, but the nurse does the \"ne-tuning\" required to send pa- tients home safely. Nurses teach about medica- tions, coping strategies, adaptive equipment, and anything else the patient requires, not only for the period of hospitalization, but also for the time when the patient leaves the facility. Individual states and facilities set the guidelines regarding teaching responsibilities for doctors and nurses. Everyone needs a little help to get started with teaching, regardless of what sort of teaching will be done. Like the forms used for the patient interviews, the facility may use standardized classes or teaching sheets. This practice helps ensure that continuity exists in teaching and that the critical information has been given to the patient. There are someTool Box |The nursing process is a system- atic approach Critical Thinking Question Your state Nurse Practice Act allows you, the LPN/ LVN, to oversee care and function as a charge nurse, as long as a registered nurse is on call. Your medical patient has gone out on a 3-hour pass with relatives and returns to your agency refusing to perform the guidelines as stated in the care plan. Your patient is argumentative but answers questions appropriately. Your data collection includes fruity odor on breath, mood swings, and hunger. You need to re-evaluate and revise the care plan but are unable to make contact with the RN on call. What would you consider to be appro- priate nursing diagnoses? What interventions can you perform and still remain within your state's scope of nursing practice? Classroom Activity Divide the class into groups of five. Each group should provide a presentation of the steps in the nursing process using different learning styles. Informal teaching, or adjunctive teaching, happens anytime, anywhere, whenever the patient needs information. The patient may see the nurse in the hall, or the nurse may no- tice that the patient is working with the colostomy bag in his room or reading the ex- ercise pamphlet. These are excellent times to reinforce what the patient has learned or to make gentle suggestions for improving his or her technique. Clinical Activity Review the medication chart of your assigned patient and provide an informal teaching about one of the medications. Write the outcome of the informal teaching.2993_Ch06_089-104 14/01/14 5:19 PM Page 97Principles of Learning Nurse-teachers need a basic understanding of the principles of learning and teaching. Some of these principles are listed here: 1.Each person learns differently. Some people process information visually, others by hearing, and still others by hands-on (tactile) learning. 2.Each person learns at his or her own pace. The larger the class, the more levels of ability the nurse will have to work with. Some patients catch on more quickly than others. 3.People learn best when the information is meaningful to them. Nurses should think of their own education: The things they are interested in are the things they work harder at. Subjects that they do not like seem to be hard or boring, yet they are required for graduation. Patients may not see the importance of the class that they may be required to attend as a crite- rion for discharge. 4.Learning is most eective when the in- formation is presented in small segments. This may be dictated by the facility, but when the nurse can be flexible, it is best to present only as much as the patient can absorb. 5.Success breeds success: Positive reinforce- ment will help the patient succeed at learning the required task. The stronger the positive reinforcement, the greater the learning. Once patients have been successful, they will want to continue to learn.98 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing nurse-teacher will need to adapt the care plan to meet a particular patient's need. A nurse-teacher who is not comfortable with the material will be less helpful to the patient than one who can individual- ize the curriculum to the various needs of the class. 3.Have a teaching plan: A good teaching plan will improve a nurse's condence and delivery of the material. A teaching plan is constructed in much the same way as the nursing process. A very simple format, such as APIE for the nursing process, may be easily transformed into a teaching format. An example of the APIE format follows. A = Assessment. What is the need for the teaching? Who are the patients? How much time is available? Assessing the need to teach can be as simple as one or two statements. For example, \"Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Sandy. This is the class about bipolar care, and it is open to anyone diagnosed with bipolar disease.\" Assessment can also be enhanced by the use of a pre-test or questions to the class to determine their past knowledge in this area. P = Plan. In true nursing process, this is often called the goal. Nurse- teachers need to ask themselves a few questions, such as: What do you plan to accomplish in the session? How do you think you will do it? Again, this can be accomplished in one or two statements. For example, \"This is the first in a series of three classes, and the task for today is to learn about the different types of appliances and equipment you have available to you.\" What is accom- plished in the first session is consid- ered as a short-term goal and the accomplishments in the third session will be the long-term goal. I = Implementation. This is the step- by-step method nurse-teachers use to accomplish the plan. It is similar to the implementation portion of the nursing process. The nurse-teacher will have as many or as few steps as Active listening enables the nurse to focus on the patient's strengths.Neeb's Tip Principles of Teaching 1.Know the patients: What are their abili- ties? What is their prior level of knowl- edge? What are the cultural or language dierences of the patients in the class? 2.Know the material: It is not as important to give a perfect lecture or demonstration as it is to be able to interpret the ques- tions patients may have. Sometimes the2993_Ch06_089-104 14/01/14 5:19 PM Page 98needed. In prepared curricula, the steps are written out, but it may or may not be necessary to perform each step. This will depend on the patient group. Chances are good that a class or skill will never be taught exactly the same way twice. There will, however, be critical items that nurses need to cover with all patients to meet legal and safety issues. E = Evaluation. In a teaching plan, nurses evaluate the patient's learning as well as the teaching performance. Some questions that nurse-teachers need to reflect on for this part of the teaching plan are: How do you know the patient has grasped the concepts and skills from the class? What do you look for? Do you need to ask for a return demonstration? Does it need to be perfect? How did you do? Did you achieve the plan? Did you have enough time? Too much time? What will you do dierently next time? How did your students evaluate the session? Evaluation criteria may change from time to time as well. 4.Be flexible: To the extent that the facility's program allows, be familiar enough with the material to be able to build in extra practice time for the tactile learn- ers, extra videos for the visual learners, or time to review verbally for the audi- tory learners. Be able to teach in several dierent styles. 5.Be able to evaluate the learning: In health teaching in the facility, evaluation can be in the form of a question-answer session, a short quiz, or a return demonstration. 6.Plan to allow a few minutes after the class for questions: Even though the nurse may ask for and welcome questions during the session, there are always people who are not comfortable asking questions in a group. These people will want your time in private, so allow some time to clarify their concerns at the time or to set up a time to help individuals later in the day. Once the plan has been developed, the nurse needs to think about how to implementthe teaching. This requires familiarity with some commonly used methods of teaching. Teachers tend to teach according to the method of learning they prefer. For instance, if nursing students prefer lecture classes, they probably feel most comfortable teaching in a lecture format. If a specic nursing instructor was particularly helpful to a nurse as a stu- dent, the nurse may prefer to role-model that teacher's methods when teaching patients. No teaching method is better or worse than any other method. What makes the dierence is the learning style of the patients and the rapport that nurses build with them. Because classes in facilities generally have more than one \"pupil,\" the nurse-teacher will need to be able to use dierent methods of presenting. Because people's personalities are dierent, each group will have a dierent dynamic and each class will be dierent. The typical methods used in health teach- ing are lecture and demonstration. 1.Lecture: This is a method designed for information giving. It is unilateral; the nurse talks, and the patients listen. It is interactive only when there is some form of question-answer period or brainstorm- ing. Lecturing is an excellent method of introducing a topic to patients and giving them some theory. It is a way to explain the signicance so the material becomes meaningful. In preset programs, the lectures are usually prepared in either text or outline form, so the nurse-teacher has to invest minimal time researching, writing, or setting up for the lectures. Lecture classes may include videos, slides, or charts. Learning from the lecture method is traditionally evaluated through quizzes or question-and-answer sessions. Be- cause not all patient participants are comfort- able answering in a group, it may be dicult to assess how much learning each individual achieves.CHAPTER 6|Nursing Process in Mental Health 99 Not everyone has the same learning style.Neeb's Tip 2.Demonstration: Demonstration is an excellent technique to follow in an 2993_Ch06_089-104 14/01/14 5:19 PM Page 99100 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing introductory lecture. For visual and tac- tile learners, it is a preferred method of learning. In prepared programs, the demonstration outline will be provided. The nurse-teacher is responsible for having the equipment ready for each patient. In diabetic teaching, for example, the nurse needs to have ready the syringes, sterile saline for injection, gloves, injection pad, and any other equipment that the agency uses. Demonstrations are eective because, after the initial demonstration, the nurse-teacher can have the individual perform a return demonstration. One-on-one help can be pro- vided if needed. This allows the nurse to make more objective assessments of the patient's learning and therefore predict the patient's ability to safely perform the technique after discharge. It also allows the nurse to individ- ualize the technique or provide options to the patient. Evaluation for this method of teaching is usually the return demonstration. The nurse watches each patient perform the technique at a level that is safe for the patient to perform when at home and not under the guidance of the health-care professional. If a home care nurse is assigned to the patient, patient teach- ing continues; the nurse also teaches the family or signicant others. Additional Patient Teaching Tips It is customary to assess eye contact and to equate eye contact with interest and attentiveness. It is important for the nurse-teacher to remember that this is a cultural behavior. Not all cultures believe that eye contact is a positive thing; in- deed, many cultures consider direct meet- ing of eyes a sign of blatant disrespect for people who are older or in a position of respect or authority. Nurses and teachers are respected in those cultural groups, and it would be a mistake on the part of the nurse to assume that the lack of direct eye contact is a sign of disinterest in or disrespect for the material. Be honest: Nobody said a nurse must have all the answers. If a nurse-teacher does notknow something, he or she should admit it. The nurse should look up the informa- tion and either bring it to the individual who asked or bring it to the next session of the class. Have fun! Teaching can be a very reward- ing part of nursing. There is no better way to reinforce nursing knowledge than to teach it to someone else. It is one way of being generative, and it is one way in which nurses can keep the nursing culture alive. Step 5: Evaluating Interventions In this nal step of the nursing process, the LPN/LVN plays an assisting role. The LPN/ LVN's observations and documentation about the effect of the interventions on the patient and progress in attaining the goal are of great importance. Accuracy in verbal and written reporting of the patient's progress will help determine whether the interventions are helpful or whether they need to be re-evaluated and changed. In some instances, some of the interventions can be terminated, depending on the patient's progress (DeWit, 2009) Nursing Outcomes Classication (NOC) is also a standardized language, which provides outcome statements; a set of indicators de- scribing specic patient, caregiver, family, or community states related to the outcome; and a ve-point measurement scale to facilitate tracking patients across care settings. It can help demonstrate patient progress even when outcomes are not fully met. NOC also is applicable in all care settings and specialties (Doenges and Moorhouse, 2003). Critical Thinking Question Select a topic to teach the class. This can be any topic with which you are comfortable. You have 10 minutes (classroom instructor may choose own time limit) to teach your topic. Develop a teaching plan. Teach your topic. Evaluate your teaching. What would you do dierently the next time?2993_Ch06_089-104 14/01/14 5:19 PM Page 100CHAPTER 6|Nursing Process in Mental Health 101 Key Concepts 1.Nursing process is an example of collabo- rative nursing practice. RNs are primarily responsible for the steps of the nursing process; LPN/LVN-prepared nurses assist in data collection, planning, imple- menting, and evaluating the nursing process. 2.The nursing process format can be used by other health-care disciplines to create a care plan. 3.Nurses are conducting more interviewing and teaching on a daily basis. Entry-level CASE STUDY 1.How would you start the nursing process for this patient? 2. Describe some questions you would ask as part of the mental status examMark is a 15-year-old student who has recently quit attending his high school classes. Mark has always been a straight-A student who participated in many social and athletic activities at his school. Today, Mark's friend Tony brings Mark to the clinic that is part of your commu- nity's hospital. Tony tells you, \"Mark got in with a bad group. He's been doing' the stuff real bad. He's been doing the needles and the smoking. He's been with me for two days, man, and he's real sick. Help him.\" You and the physician undertake an as- sessment of Mark and nd that he has yel- lowing of his sclera. He has a fruity odor on his breath and is vomiting copiously. Mark's level of consciousness is guarded; he is in and out of coherence and is not areliable source of information about himself at this time. The physician noties Mark's parents and explains that Mark may have several conditions, including but not limited to serum hepatitis. Meanwhile, you continue to admit Mark to the hospital for further testing and medical care. He is placed in enteric isolation as a precaution. An IV is started and you begin to explain the hospital routines to Mark. After you tell him that he must remain in his room for now and that his visitors will be limited during the time of the isolation precautions, he becomes angry. He conveys to you that this is \"an invasion of his privacy\" and that \"you nurses are all part of the conspiracy.\" nurses need a basic knowledge of both skills. Individual states and facilities set the guidelines for teaching within the scope of the nurse's practice. 4.Nursing process is a helpful tool for preparing a teaching plan. 5.The ANA has set guidelines that dic- tate the roles of the RN and the LPN/ LVN in collaborating in the nursing process. 6.New models for collaborative nursing and nursing outcome statements are being developed.2993_Ch06_089-104 14/01/14 5:19 PM Page 101REFERENCES DeWit, S.

But what do they mean? What is coping? Coping is the way one adapts to a stressor psychologically, physically, and behaviorally. It is the ability one develops to deal consciously with problems and stress. goals of a change in behavior emphasize demonstration of specic eective coping skills. Biology plays a role in coping in the presence of some psychiatric disorders. What is an eective coping skill, and how do nurses observe and measure it? 105CHAPTER7 Coping and Defense Mechanisms Learning Objectives 1.Dene coping. 2.Dierentiate between eective and ineective coping. 3.Dene defense (coping) mechanisms. 4.Identify main defense mechanisms.Key Terms Adaptation Coping Defense mechanisms Eective coping Ineective coping As a health-care provider, it important to realize that coping is individualized.Neeb's Tip Individuals have dierent methods of coping or dealing with their stressors. What makes some people very successful at han- dling stress and others not successful at all? What allows some people to have a drink or run to reduce their stress and causes others to become addicted to the same behavior? The answers to these questions are, of course, complex. Cultures, religions, and individual belief systems seem to be the lead factors in this mystery. Personal choices also play a support- ing role. It is not the value of a behavior that nurses observe; it is the desired outcome that is important. The short-term and long-termEective coping skills are those that are specically identied to oer healthy choices to the patient. For example, it is very com- mon to see patients use a variety of coping mechanisms to help deal with hospitalization. Hospitalization is a stressful experience for patients and families, with so many unknown and unfamiliar things, noises, and interrup- tions. The patient may not understand the illness or the implications of the treatment plan. Mealtimes may be dierent from the routine at home. The patient's plans are dis- rupted, nancial status is altered, and there is a possible temporary loss of independence. Eective coping can be more challenging to a one-income family. Allowing the patient and his or her family members to be activeTool Box |Managing Stress www.webmd.com/balance/stress- management/stress-management- topic-overview2993_Ch07_105-112 14/01/14 5:19 the treatment plan will in- crease the patient's ability to use eective cop- ing skills (Fig. 7-1). The patient should be included in the decision making as to which new behaviors are acceptable and which ones are not. Practicing these new behaviors in a safe place, such as a hospital or organized group setting, is the secret to success. This will probably require a lifestyle change for the pa- tient, and it will be hard work. As the saying goes, \"Old habits die hard,\" but old habits can die and healthy new ones can replace them. This process of eective coping is sometimes called adaptation. Allowing the patient to \"practice\" the new coping techniques will promote condence and decrease the stress that can accompany change. The patient will adapt to the stress by using the new tools. Chapters 8 & 9 will introduce the reader to other interventions that can be used for cop- ing eectively with stress. then provide information that will reinforce the patient's positive feelings. Providing hon- est, positive feedback about the patient's progress in a given lifestyle change will let the patient know that others are noticing the hard work that he or she has done.106 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Figure 7-1 Involving patients and their families in the treatment plan can go a long way toward reducing the stress of hospitalization. (From Williams and Hopper (2011). Understanding Medical-Surgical Nursing, 4th ed. Philadelphia: F .A. Davis Company, with permission.)Clinical Activity Assist in a group session and provide instructions and demonstrate a relaxation technique. Ask for feedback after the session. One of the most helpful actions a nurse can take is to actively listen to the patient's thoughts and feelings about the stressor and Think about when you are verbaliz- ing your thoughts and feelings and thinking, \"Just listen to me and vali- date what I am saying.\" This is no dif- ferent from what the patient expects when expressing his or her thoughts and feelings.Neeb's Tip Often, the dividing line between eective and ineective coping is in the degree of tension and the past experience with it. For instance, a little worry or anxiety can be a positive thing. A bride making preparations for her wedding is stressed, but the expecta- tion is that the outcome will be positive. Most of the time when there is a little tension, people are more alert and ready to respond. The \"ght or flight\" mechanism can actually help people adapt to a new situation. Too much worry begins to cloud the conscious- ness and interferes with a person's ability to make appropriate choices and recall the new adaptive tools he or she has learned (Fig. 7-2). For example, a bride can become paralyzed with all the decisions to be made and then become unable to proceed, demonstrating in- eective coping (see below). Ineective coping is when the techniques people try are not successful or are hazardous. People often allow themselves to fall into habits that give them the illusion of coping. For example, a person might have a drink every time an experience is frustrating. People usually have diculty understanding that they are using ineective methods of coping. Ineective coping is one's rationale for his or her behavior. These habits are called defense mechanisms. Critical Thinking Question Imagine that you are admitted into the hospital with an undetermined illness. Describe how it would aect you nancially, as a student, and as a parent, and the stress each situation would create.2993_Ch07_105-112 14/01/14 5:19 PM Page 106CHAPTER 7|Coping and Defense Mechanisms 107 Defense Mechanisms Defense mechanisms are mental pressure valves. Defense mechanisms give the illusion that they are helping to alleviate a person's stress level, when in reality they mask the stress and may actually end up increasing it. Defense mechanisms come out of the ego mechanism of Freud's theory of personality. Although they appear to be very purposeful, they exist, for the most part, on the uncon- scious level. The purpose of defense mechanisms is to reduce or eliminate anxiety. Surprisingly, when used in very small doses, they can be helpful. It is when they are overused that they become ineffective and can lead to a breakdown of the personality. Again, people are not born with these behaviors; they are learned as responses to stress. Many times, they are developed by the time people are 10 years old. Because the main purpose of defense mechanisms is to decrease anxiety, peopletend to have their own repertoire of them and to use them (unconsciously) over and over. Periods of high stress are not the times to try something new, so the psyche uses the old \"standbys\" to get over yet another hump in life. Some of the commonly used defense mechanisms are shown in Table 7-1. Figure 7-2 A little anxiety can be positive in some situations. Classroom Activity List three situations that were very uncomfort- able for you. What defense mechanisms did you use? How will you respond to each of these situations in a more eective manner? List three situations in which you observed someone else using defense mechanisms. How can you help him or her to cope in a more eec- tive manner? Critical Thinking Question Nurse D, LVN, has been routinely calling in \"sick\" on his weekends to work. This has created a hardship for the patients and the sta. On Monday, Nurse D reports for the assigned work shift but is called to the nurse manager's oce. The nurse manager informs Nurse D of the pattern that has devel- oped in his attendance and gives him a chance to explain the situation. Nurse D says, \"Well, I am a single parent and I need to take care of my chil- dren. You should assign single people without families to work the weekends. If you cared a little more about your employees, we wouldn't have to call in so often.\" Nurse D is quiet for a second and then says with a shaky voice, \"You make me so nervous that I've started needing a couple of drinks at night so I can sleep. I could quit drinking any time, if you'd just let me have my weekends o.\" What defense mechanisms do you hear Nurse D using? How many of them have you used? If you were the nurse manager, what would you say to Nurse D? Using three of the suggested nursing diagnoses listed in Appendix E, complete a nurs- ing process for Nurse D. Classroom Activity In a group, watch a television newscast as assigned by the instructor. Pick one topic. Each group should watch its assigned newscast at the assigned time. 1. Identify all of the defense mechanisms you can within that news interview. 2. In what ways do hearing defense mechanisms change the way you may listen to and process what you hear in the media?2993_Ch07_105-112 14/01/14 5:19 PM Page 107108 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing lTable 7-1 Commonly Used Defense Mechanisms Mechanism Description Examples Denial Repression Dissociation Rationalization Compensation Reaction Formation (Overcompensation) Regression Usually the rst defense learned and used. Unconscious refusal to see reality. An unconscious burying or \"forgetting\" mechanism. Excludes or withholds from people's consciousness events or situations that are unbearable. A step deeper than \"denial.\" Painful events or situations are separated or dissociated from the conscious mind. Could be described as an out-of-body experience. Substituting acceptable rea- sons for the true reasons for personal behavior because admitting true reasons is too threatening. Making up for something a person perceives as an inade- quacy by developing some other desirable trait. Similar to compensation, except the person usually develops the opposite trait. Emotionally returning to an earlier time in life when there was far less stress. Commonly seen in patients while hospitalized. Note: Everyone does not go back to the same developmental age. This is highly individualized. The alcoholic states, \"I can quit any time I want to.\" Is not consciously lying. Demonstrating emotions toward a person, but unable to identify the specic reason. Patient who had been sexually abused as a child describes the situation as if it happened to a friend or sibling. Police visit parent to inform parent of death of child in car accident. Parent tells police, \"That's impossible. My child is upstairs asleep. You must have the wrong house.\" \"I failed the test because the teacher wrote bad questions.\" \"The patient kept interrupting me so I got distracted and he caused me to make a mistake.\" A small boy who wants to be a basketball center; instead be- comes an honor roll student. The physically unattractive person who wants to model instead becomes a famous designer. The small boy who wants to be a basketball center becomes a political voice to decrease the emphasis of sports in the elementary grades. The physically unattractive per- son who wants to be a model speaks out for eliminating beauty pageants. Children who are toilet trained beginning to wet themselves. During serious illness, a patient exhibits behavior more appro- priate for a younger develop- mental age, such as excessive dependency.2993_Ch07_105-112 14/01/14 5:19 PM Page 108CHAPTER 7|Coping and Defense Mechanisms 109 lTable 7-1 Commonly Used Defense Mechanisms\u2014cont'd Mechanism Description Examples Sublimation Projection Displacement Restitution (Undoing) Isolation Conversion Reaction Avoidance ScapegoatingUnacceptable traits or characteristics are diverted into acceptable traits or characteristics.

The \"kick-the-dog syndrome.\" Transferring anger and hostility to another person or object that is perceived to be less powerful. Makes amends for a behavior one thinks is unacceptable. Makes an attempt at reducing guilt. Emotion that is separated from the original feeling. Anxiety is channeled into physi- cal symptoms. Note: Often, the symptoms disappear soon after the threat is over. Unconsciously staying away from events or situations that might open feelings of aggres- sion or anxiety. Blaming others Burglar teaches home safety classes. Person who is potentially physi- cally abusive becomes a profes- sional sports gure. People who choose to not have children run a day-care center.

Young soldier is fearful of up- coming deployment and says, \"Those other guys are a bunch of cowards.\" Parent loses job without notice; goes home and verbally abuses spouse, who unjustly punishes child, who slaps the dog. Giving a treat to a child who is being punished for a wrong-doing. The person who nds a lost wal- let with a large amount of cash, does not return the wallet, but puts extra in the collection plate at the next church service. \"I wasn't really angry; just a little upset.\" Nausea develops the night before a major exam, causing the person to miss the exam. Nausea may disappear soon after the scheduled test is nished. \"I can't go to the class reunion tonight. I'm just so tired, I have to sleep.\" \"I didn't get the promotion be- cause you don't like me.\"2993_Ch07_105-112 14/01/14 5:19 PM Page 109110 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing REFERENCES Gorman, L.M., and Sultan, D.F .

People are not stressed by the same things, nor do they deal with their stress in the same ways. 2.Defense mechanisms are believed to be part of the ego of Freud's description of personality. They are based in the unconscious, for the most part, but they can appear to be very deliberate. 3.Use of defense mechanisms for a short period can be helpful. The mechanisms act like a pressure valve and allow the psyche to put the stress into perspective.

When emotional health is threatened, many other daily activities can be altered as well. Cognitive ability (the ability to think rationally and to process those thoughts) can be decreased. Emotional responses can be decreased or even absent in some condi- tions. These alterations can be extremely frightening to a patient who may already feel unable to control his or her life; this can lead to a deepening of the mental dis- order or even the development of another disorder.Patients can develop a sense of helplessness and hopelessness about themselves and their conditions. Nurses can be the tools that help the patient regain control. A nurse may be ob- serving the patient's treatments and therapies or may be an active part of them. Either way, the nurse will be making observations about the patient's reactions and participating in the 113CHAPTER8 Mental Health Treatments Learning Objectives 1.Describe a therapeutic milieu. 2.Identify classications of psychotropic medications. 3.Identify uses, actions, side eects, and nursing considerations for selected of psychoanalysis. 7.Describe three types of counseling. 8.Describe electroconvulsive therapy and the nurse's role in it. 9.Identify the ve phases of crisis and the nurse's role in them. 10.

This chapter discusses some of the more frequently used methods for treating alterations in mental health. Psychopharmacology Since the introduction of the phenothiazines in the 1950s, the number of medications available for treating patients who have men- tal health disorders, comprising the eld of psychopharmacology, has increased greatly. The reasons for using medications ar e twofold: First, the medications control symptoms, thus helping the patient to feel more comfortable emotionally. Second, the medications are usually used in connection with some other type of therapy. The patient is generally more receptive and able to focus on therapy if med- ications are also used. Several classications of psychoactive drugs (also referred to as psychotropics) are discussed below; however, there are far too many drugs to discuss each one individually in this text. In most cases, only the most common information is pre- sented about a medication. Nurses should consult a pharmacology or drug reference book for more specic information before administering these medications or instruct- ing patients on their use.schizophrenia and other acute or chronic psychotic behavior including violent or po- tentially violent behavior. Antipsychotics are classied as typical or atypical. Typical an- tipsychotic agents treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations, delusions, and suspiciousness. Atypical an- tipsychotic agents reduce the negative symp- toms of schizophrenia, such as flat aect, social withdrawal, and diculty with abstract thinking. (See Chapter 15 for further discus- sion of these symptoms.) Side Eects: Antipsychotics have many un- pleasant side eects. Sometimes people are re- luctant to take these medications because they are afraid that the side eects will be worse than the illness. Some of these side eects are photosensitivity (especially with Thorazine), darkening of the skin from increased pigmen- tation, anticholinergic eects such as dry mouth, and a group of side eects called ex- trapyramidal symptoms (EPS). There is less risk of EPS with the atypical agents, but early observation and reporting of any possible EPS are crucial to minimizing these eects on the patient. The EPS include: 1.Drug-induced parkinsonism (pseudo- parkinsonism). Symptoms appear 1 to 8 weeks after the patient begins the med- ication. The major symptom is akinesia (muscle weakness), shuing gait, drool- ing, fatigue, mask-like facial expression, tremors, and muscle rigidity. 2.Akathisia. Symptoms appear 2 to 10 weeks after the patient starts taking the medica- tion. Symptoms are agitation and motor restlessness, and they seem to appear more frequently in women. There is no absolute reason for this, but it is suggested that it may be due to hormonal interaction with the medication. 3.Dystonia. Symptoms appear 1 to 8 weeks after the patient starts taking the medica- tion. Symptoms manifest as bizarre distortions or involuntary movements of any muscle group. Tongue, eyes, face, neck (torticollis), or any larger muscle mass can become tightened into an un- natural position or have irregular spastic movements. 114 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing act on the central nervous system (CNS). Their main ac- tion is to block the dopamine receptors. Dopamine is a neurochemical that the human body contains naturally. However, if it is over- produced or utilized incorrectly, it can cause someone to exhibit psychotic behavior. Atyp- ical antipsychotic agents block both serotonin (a neurochemical) Uses: Antipsychotics are used to treat psy- chotic behavior such as schizophrenia and other disorders. The antipsychotic will treat2993_Ch08_113-142 14/01/14 5:20 115 4.T ardive dyskinesia (TD). Symptoms appear within 1 to 8 weeks after the patient starts taking the medication. The frequently seen manifestations are rhyth- mic, involuntary movements that look like chewing, sucking, or licking motions. Frowning and blinking constantly are also common. TD is irreversible. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an uncommon but potentially fatal reaction to treatment with neuroleptic medications. Symptoms include muscle rigidity, hyper- pyrexia, fluctuations in blood pressure, and altered level of consciousness. Early recogni- tion and immediate medical care are impor- tant. Some antipsychotics, such as Clozaril, are known to cause serious blood dyscrasias and require regular monitoring of blood counts. Contraindications: Antipsychotics should be used carefully in patients who are hyper- sensitive to medications or who have brain damage or blood dyscrasias. Nursing Considerations: Careful teaching by doctors and nurses can help the patient to understand that these are very strong medications. The possibility of seizures increases in patients who require antipsychotic medications. Observe for any sign of EPS or NMS and carefully monitor blood work for abnormal results. Careful instruction to the patient and family regarding wearing a wide-brimmed hat, covering all exposed skin, and using a sunscreen when in the sun will help lessen chances of the patient's suering sunburn, especially if the patient is using Thorazine. Temperature extremes should be avoided. Patients should be taught to avoid alcohol. Over-the-counter (OTC) medication and other products should not be taken with- out doctor approval. It is important to instruct the patient not to alter the dose without rst discussing it with the doctor. Occasionally, the patient might experience some gastric distress with oral antipsy- chotics, so give them to the patient with food or milk.Antipsychotic medication should be dis- continued slowly. If medication is ordered once daily, teaching patients to take the medication 1 to 2 hours before going to bed works well and promotes sleep. Antacids de- crease the absorption of antipsychotics, so these types of medications should be taken 1 to 2 hours after oral administration of antipsychotics. Box 8-1 provides some of the most com- monly used antipsychotic agents. Also see Chapter 15, Table 15-6, Compar- ison of Side Eects ticholinergics) (Fig 8-1) inhibit the action of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine increases as dopamine decreases at its receptor sites (the cholinergic eect). When the amount of acetylcholine available to interact with dopamine is decreased, there is a better bal- ance between the two neurochemicals, and the symptoms of parkinsonism decrease. Uses: Antiparkinson agents help decrease the eects of drug-induced and non-drug- induced symptoms of parkinsonism that often occur with antipsychotics. Side Eects: Blurred vision, dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, tachycardia, urinary retention, constipation, and changes in blood pressure. Contraindications: Patients with known hy- persensitivity should not use these medications. lBox Health Nursing People with glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, pep- tic ulcers, prostatic hypertrophy, or urine re- tention should not take these medications. These agents should be avoided in children under the age of 12 years and used with cau- tion with the elderly.Antianxiety Agents (Anxiolytics/ Minor Tranquilizers) Action: the 8-2). Uses: Antianxiety agents decrease the ef- fects of stress, anxiety, and mild depression. They can be used preoperatively to help pro- mote sedation. Side Eects: The use of antianxiety agents can cause physical and psychological depend- ence. Other side eects include drowsiness, lethargy, fainting, postural hypotension, nau- sea, and vomiting. If discontinued abruptly, severe side eects, including nausea, hypoten- sion, and fatal grand mal seizures, can occur anywhere from 12 hours to 2 weeks after the drug is stopped. Contraindications: Patients with known hypersensitivity should not use these med - ications. People with a history of chemical dependency are not good candidates for this classication of drug because of the potential for addiction. Nursing Considerations: Nurses should monitor blood pressure before and after giving this medicationNursing Considerations: Monitor blood pressure carefully (at least every 4 hours when beginning treatment). Encourage using hard, sugarless candy or saliva substitute to combat the eects of dry mouth. Box 8-2 provides some of the most com- monly used antiparkinson agents. Assess if your patient has glaucoma. Neeb's TipANTIPARKINSON AGENTS Inhibits the action of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine increases as dopamine decreases at its receptor sites. When the amount of acetylcholine available to interact with dopamine is decreased, there is a better balance between the two neurochemicals, and the symptoms of parkinsonism decrease. USES Decrease the effects of drug-induced and non-drug-induced symptoms of parkinsonism.SIDE EFFECTS Blurred vision, dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, tachycardia, urinary retention, constipation, and changes in blood pressure.NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Should be avoided in children under 12 years of age. Use with caution with the elderly. Blood pressure should be monitored carefully.PATIENT TEACHING Use hard, sugarless candy to combat the effects of dry mouth. Increase dietary roughage to maintain bowel functioning. May cause drowsiness, so should not drive or operate equipment until the response to medication is established. Figure 8-1 Antiparkinson agents. Treatments 117 and monitor for signs of orthostatic hypotension, especially if taking tricyclics (Townsend, 2012). The patient should rise slowly from sitting or lying positions to prevent a sudden drop in blood pressure. When possible, these types of drugs should be given at bedtime to help promote sleep, minimize side effects, and allow a more normal daytime routine. Administer intramuscular (IM) dosages deeply and slowly into large muscle masses. The Z-track method of IM administration is preferred. It is important to teach the patient and family that it is not safe for the patient to drive or use alcohol while using this classication of medication. Box 8-3 provides some of the most com- monly used antianxiety agents.Antidepressants (Mood Elevators) Antidepressants have several subgroups and dierent drug references that subdivide the antidepressants dierently. There are similari- ties and dierences among the subgroups (Fig. 8-3). Antidepressants generally take several weeks to see a change in mood. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) (Bicyclic Antidepressants) Action: These drugs increase the availability of serotonin, which is decreased in the brains of depressed individuals. Uses: T reatment of depression, anxiety, ob- sessive disorders, impulse control disorders. Side Eects: Potential for increased suicidal tendencies, sedation, dry mouth, agitation, postural hypotension, headache, arthralgia, dizziness, insomnia, confusion, and tremors. Contraindications: Patients with known hy- persensitivity should not use these medica- tions. People using monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or who are within 14 days of discontinuing MAOIs should not use these medications. People using certain herbal prepa- rations including but not limited to St. John's wort, ginseng, brewer's yeast, vitamin B6, and ginkgo biloba should not use SSRIs without consulting their physician.ANTIANXIETY DRUGS Depress activities of the cerebral cortex. USES Decrease the effects of stress or mild depression without causing sedation.SIDE EFFECTS Can cause physical and psychological dependence, drowsiness, lethargy, fainting, postural hypotension, nausea, and vomitting.NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Administer intramuscular (IM) dosages deeply, slowly, and into large muscle masses. Z-track method of IM administration is preferred. Discontinue slowly.PATIENT TEACHING Teach the patient and family that it is not safe to drive or use alcohol while using this classification of medication. Instruct to change positions slowly. Figure 8-2 Antianxiety Health Nursing Tricyclic Antidepressants Action: These drugs increase the level of sero- tonin and norepinephrine, thereby increasing the ability of the nerve cells to pass informa- tion to each other. Patients with depressive disorders generally have decreased amounts of these two neurochemicals. Uses: T reatment of symptoms of depres- sion, including (but not limited to) sleep dis- turbances, sexual function disturbances, changes in appetite, and cognitive changes. Side Eects: Sedation, lethargy, dry mouth, constipation, tachycardia, postural hypoten- sion, urine retention, blurred vision, weight gain, and changes in blood glucose. Contraindications: Patients with known hypersensitivity should not use these med- ications. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and individuals with kidney disease, liver disease, or a recent myocardialNote: In October 2004, producers of SSRIs were required by the F .D.A. to place a boxed- in warning on the medication container cau- tioning about the danger of increased risk of suicidal tendencies in children, adolescents, and young adults while taking this medication. Nursing Considerations: Do not abruptly discontinue the medica- tion, except under the supervision of a health-care provider. Serotonin syndrome, which includes altered mental status, restlessness, tachycardia, and labile blood pressure, can occur with abrupt discontin- uation as well as when SSRIs are com- bined with some other medications. Caution should be used with driving or activities that require alertness. Alcohol and CNS depressants should be avoided. Hard, sugarless candy or saliva substitute can be used to treat dry mouth. The patient should change positions slowly to avoid a sudden drop in blood pressure. Monitor the patient for suicide ideation. Box 8-4 provides some of the most com- monly used SSRI agents.ANTIDEPRESSANTS Medications that acts to prevent, cure, or alleviate mental depression. USES Treatment of depression and some anxiety disorders.SIDE EFFECTS Drowsiness, dry mouth, agitation, postural hypotension, vertigo, constipation, urine retention, weight gain, blurred vision, photosensitivity, and suicidal tendencies.NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Encourage patients to continue taking the medication during this time, although they may not feel any change in their mood for up to 3 weeks after beginning the medication. Discontinue slowly. Observe for suicidal ideation.PATIENT TEACHING Instruct to protect from sunburn. Teach to change positions slowly. Teach diet restrictions with MAOIs. Use other medications only with physician approval. Figure 8-3 infarction should not take these medica- tions. Anyone who has asthma, seizure dis- orders, schizophrenia, benign prostatic hypertrophy, or alcoholism should use tri- cyclic antidepressants with extreme caution. Nursing Considerations: Patients should not stop using these med- ications abruptly. Medications (including over-the-counter medications such as cold preparations) that contain antihistamines, alcohol, sodium bicarbonate, benzodiazepines, and eect of the tricyclic antidepressant. Serotonin syndrome can occur if combined with St John's wort. Box 8-5 provides some of the most com- monly used tricyclic antidepressant agents. Tetracyclic Antidepressants (Heterocyclic Antidepressants) The actions, uses, side eects, and nursing considerations for the tetracyclic antidepressants are similar to those for SSRIs. Box 8-6 provides some of the most com- tetracyclic antidepressant agents.Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) drugs of serotonin and norepinephrine, which are de- creased in the brains of depressed individuals. The uses, contraindications, side eects, and nursing considerations for the SNRI an- tidepressants are similar to those for SSRIs. Box 8-7 provides some of the most com- enzyme, monoamine oxi- dase. Too much oxidase can lead to destructive, psychotic behaviors. Uses: MAOIs are generally used for patients with varied types of depression who have not been helped by other antidepressants. Side Eects: Postural hypotension, photosen- sitivity (sunburn potential), headache, dizziness, memory impairment, tremors, fatigue, insom- nia, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. Contraindications: Patients with known hy- persensitivity should not use these medica- tions. MAOI medications should be given carefully to patients who have asthma, con- gestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, glaucoma, blood pressure conditions, schizo- phrenia, alcoholism, liver or kidney disorders, or severe headaches, as well as to those who are over 60 years old or pregnant. There are many drug-drug interactions that may occur if MAOI agents are combined with other medications. Other prescriptions and over- the-counter products should be taken only after consulting a doctor or a pharmacist. Nursing Considerations: Teach patients to avoid foods containing the amino acid tyramine, a precursor of norepinephrine, while taking these lBox tyramine, resulting in increased norepinephrine. A hypertensive crisis may occur. Foods containing signicant amounts of tyramine include Aged cheese (cheddar, Swiss, provolone, blue cheese, parmesan) Avocados (guacamole) Yogurt, sour cream Chicken and beef livers, pickled herring, corned beef Bean pods Bananas, raisins, and gs Smoked and processed meat (salami, pepperoni, and bologna) Yeast supplements Chocolate Meat tenderizers (MSG), soy sauce Beer, red wines, and caeine Box 8-8 provides some of the most com- monly used MAOI agents. Alternative Treatments for Depression People are seeking alternatives to the prescrip- tion antidepressant drugs available through traditional western medicine. Some reasons they seek alternatives include cultural prefer- ences, cost of medications, insurance issues, and unpleasant side eects they may experi- ence with the medications they have used. One such alternative is a chemical called SAMe (\"sammy\"). SAMe is a combination of an amino acid (methionine) and ATP . It is used as an antidepressant and sold in the United States as a dietary supplement. Other alternative forms of therapy are explored in Chapter 9. The nurse's role is the same with these alternative choices as it is with prescription medications. Nurses must encourage their patients to discuss the use of supplements with their physicians and to provide as muchinformation as possible to allow the patient to make safe, informed choices. Box 8-9 provides nursing considerations for all antidepressants. Antimanic Agents (Mood Stabilizing Agents) Lithium carbonate was the drug of choice for treatment and management of bipolar mania for many years. In recent years, several other antimanic agents (Fig. 8-4) have become treatment options. Other medications being used as mood stabilizers include some anti- convulsants and calcium channel blockers. Lithium Carbonate Action: The exact action of lithium is not completely known at this time. It is not me- tabolized by the body. One hypothesis about the action of lithium is that there seems to be a connection between lithium and constancy of sodium concentration, which might help regulate and moderate information along the nerve cells, thus preventing mood swings. An- other possibility is that lithium increases the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, thereby decreasing hyperactivity. Uses: Lithium is used for the manic phase of bipolar disorder and sometimes for other depressive or schizoaective disorders. Side Eects: Side eects can be numerous. Some of the more common ones are thirst and dry mouth, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and fatigue.120 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Reinforce the teaching that these medica- tions take several weeks to become eec- tive. Encourage patients to continue taking the medication during this time, although they may not feel any change in their mood right away. All antidepressant medications should be ta- pered gradually rather than abruptly discon- tinued to prevent withdrawal symptoms. It is imperative that all patients receiving antidepressant medications be monitored for suicide potential throughout treatment.2993_Ch08_113-142 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 120Contraindications: Consistent with those of the other categories listed earlier. Nursing Considerations: Encourage patients to keep all appoint- ments for blood work and evaluation of drug eectiveness. Therapeutic serum lev- els are between 0.5 and 1.2 mEq/L for most patients (1.0 to 1.5 in acute mania). Symptoms of lithium toxicity begin to appear at blood levels greater than 1.5 mEq/L. Signs of toxicity include se- vere diarrhea, persistent nausea and vom- iting, muscle weakness, tremors, blurred vision, slurred speech, and seizures. Lithium crosses the placenta and milk barriers, so women of childbearing years may need to be counseled regarding the eects of this drug on their pregnancy and breastfeeding. Dehydration and fevers can cause increased danger of toxicity. Adequate fluid and sodium intake are es- sential. Patients should not decrease their dietary intake of salt (unless instructed to do so by the physician) and should betaught to inform the physician immedi- ately if they are ill. Hard, sugarless candy can be helpful to decrease dry mouth and thirst. Box 8-10 provides some of the most com- monly used forms of Lithium Anticonvulsants Action: The action of anticonvulsants in the treatment of bipolar disorder is not clear. Uses: These drugs stabilize the manic episodes in bipolar disorders. Side Eects: Nausea, vomiting, indigestion, drowsiness, dizziness, prolonged bleeding, headache, confusion. Contraindications: Patients with known hy- persensitivity or with bone marrow suppression should not use these medications. CautionCHAPTER 8|Mental Health Treatments 121 ANTIMANIC AGENTS USES To stabilize the manic phase in bipolar disorder.SIDE EFFECTS Thirst, dry mouth, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, tremors, headache, drowsiness, and confusion.NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Observe for signs of toxicity: severe diarrhea, muscle weakness, persistent nausea and vomiting, and seizures. Dehydration and fever can cause toxicity.PATIENT TEACHING Instruct patient to have periodic lab tests to monitor lithium blood levels. Teach patient to have adequate fluid and sodium intake. Teach patient the signs of toxicity and to notify the physician if any indication of toxicity. Hard, sugarless candy can be helpful for dry mouth and thirst. Instruct patient that pregnancy and breast- feeding are not recommended while taking these medications.

Caution should also be used with the elderly and children. Nursing Considerations: Do not stop the medication abruptly. The medication should be tapered when therapy is discontinued. Teach patients to avoid alcohol. Nonprescription medications should not be used without doctor approval. Patients should not drive or operate dan- gerous equipment until the eects of the medication are known. Box 8-11 provides some of the most com- monly used anticonvulsant agents. Calcium Channel Blockers The action, uses, side effects, contraindica- tions, and nursing considerations are similar to those for anticonvulsants. Postural hy- potension and bradycardia are additional side effects. The patient should rise slowly from sitting or lying positions to prevent a sudden drop in blood pressure. Commonlyused calcium channel blockers are Calan or Isoptin (verapamil). Stimulants Stimulants (Fig. 8-5) are readily available over the counter as well as by prescription. They are found over the counter in diet prepara- tions, pills to prevent sleep, cigarettes, and caeinated beverages such as coee, energy drinks, and soda. They are used medically to combat narcolepsy and attention-decit/ hyperactivity disorder in children. Amphetamines are one type of stimulant. Amphetamines can be abused, and they have many \"street names,\" including \"uppers,\" \"speed,\" and \"bennies.\" The ease with which they are available should not diminish the power and potential danger of the drug (see Chapter 17). Action: Stimulants provide direct stimula- tion of the central nervous system (CNS). Uses: These drugs promote alertness, dimin- ish appetite, and combat narcolepsy (sleep dis- order related to abnormal rapid eye movement sleep). They are used in the treatment of attention-decit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Side Eects: Increased or irregular heartbeat, hypertension, hyperactivity, dry mouth, hand tremor, rapid speech, diaphoresis, confusion, depression, seizures, suicidal ideation, and insomnia. Contraindications: Patients with known hy- persensitivity should not use these medications.122 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing substance that increases performance temporally.

Because these are chemicals that increase stimulation of the CNS and respiratory systems, they should not be given to people who are alcoholic, manic, or who display suicidal or homicidal ideations. People who have heart disease or glaucoma also should not use these drugs because of the potential eect of the medications. Elderly people and patients who have diabetes, hyper- tension, or other cardiovascular conditions should use these drugs cautiously and with careful monitoring. Nursing Considerations: Tolerance and physical and psychological dependence can occur with CNS stimu- lants, especially with long-term use. Do not discontinue medication abruptly. Monitor for suicide potential. Diabetic patients who take amphetamines should be informed that the ampheta- mines may cause changes in their insulin requirements. These medications can also cause changes in judgment; therefore, people should be counseled to use extreme caution when driving or operating equipment and should avoid these activities if possible. Encourage frequent rinsing of the mouth with water or use of hard, sugarless candy or saliva substitute to relieve dry mouth. Box 8-12 provides some of the most com- monly used stimulant agents. Milieu One of the areas that nurses have some control over is the therapeutic environment itself. In mental health terminology, this therapeutic en- vironment is called the milieu, or therapeutic milieu. It is believed that the environment has an eect on behavior. Think about a personwho goes to an event such as a concert or a ballgame that he does not feel excited about. That person might begin screaming or singing along and generally getting into the spirit of things shortly after arriving at the event. The milieu is the setting that will provide safety and help during the patient's stay. The milieu therapy is intended to combine the social and the therapeutic environments. In that way, every contact between nurse and patient gives the opportunity for a thera- peutic interaction. The milieu must be com- fortable and safe. Patients need to feel accepted as they learn new behaviors. It is best to have the milieu as appropriate to the situation as possible. Obviously, nurses can- not move walls and change decorating themes in the hospital, but they can allow the patient to choose the room for therapy or move to an area where the patient is more comfortable. If the patient is on a psychi- atric unit rather than a medical or surgical unit, he or she is usually allowed to walk from area to area on the unit. A nurse can keep the area calm and quiet and arrange for roommate changes if needed. There are many things a nurse can and must do to maintain a milieu that is conducive to a pa- tient's progress. As the patient progresses, the milieu will be changed to allow the pa- tient to take on more responsibility. Psychotherapies Psychotherapy (Fig. 8-6) is the term used to describe the form of treatment chosen by the psychologist or psychiatrist or other mental health therapist to treat an individual. The goals of psychotherapy are to: 1.Decrease the patient's emotional discomfort. 2.Increase 8|Mental Health Adderal (dextroamphetamine/amphetamine)Critical Thinking Question You are to go on an assigned unit in a mental health floor to monitor a group discussing anger. You are feeling apprehensive and fearful about being on the same unit as these patients. De- scribe how you might feel after hearing how the patients' home life relates to this anger. 2993_Ch08_113-142 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 1233.Increase the patient's ability to behave or perform in a manner appropriate to the situation. These goals are achieved in a variety of ways, including therapeutic relationships, open and honest venting of feelings and thoughts, allow- ing the patient to practice new coping skills, helping the patient to gain insight into the problem, and consistency in the team ap- proach to the patient's care and treatment. Pos- itive reinforcement of progress is encouraged. Some therapies may be focused on gaining in- sight into the reasons for current behavior and others are more focused on changing specic behaviors. Several types of therapy are typically used. Nurses may or may not be actively involved in the therapy, but to provide continuity in the care of the patient, they must understand the basic ideas of the types of therapy. Psychoanalysis Psychoanalysis is the form of therapy that originated from the theories of Sigmund Freud. In psychoanalysis, the focus is on the cause of the problem, which is buried some- where in the unconscious. The therapist tries to take the patient into the past in an effort to determine where the problem began. Chances are, according to Freud, that the problem is related to poor parent- child relationships and ineffective psycho- sexual development.It is typical for the psychoanalyst to be po- sitioned at the head of the patient and slightly behind, so that the patient cannot see the ther- apist. This decreases any kind of nonverbal communication between the two people. The patient is typically on the \"couch,\" relaxed and ready to focus on the therapist's instructions. Some of the techniques used in psycho- analysis are as follows. Free Association In free association, the patient is allowed to say whatever comes to mind in response to a word that is given by the therapist. For exam- ple, the therapist might say \"mother\" or \"blue,\" and the patient would give a response, also typically one word, to each of the words the therapist says. The therapist then looks for a theme or pattern to the patient's responses. So, if the patient responds \"evil\" to the word \"mother\" or \"dead\" to the word \"blue,\" the therapist might pick up one potential theme, but if the patient responds \"kind\" and \"true\" to the words \"mother\" and \"blue,\" the therapist might hear a completely dierent theme. The theme may give the therapist an idea of the cause of the patient's emotional disturbance. Dream Analysis Because Freudians believe that behavior is rooted in the unconscious and that dreams are a manifestation of the troubles people repress,124 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing PSYCHOTHERAPIES Therapies selected by a psychologist or psychiatrist. USES For treatment of various alterations to mental health.DESIRED OUTCOMES 1. Patient states improvement in emotional discomfort. 2. Patient returns to comfortable social functioning. 3.

Figure 8-6 Psychotherapies.2993_Ch08_113-142 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 124what better way to get an idea of the problem than to monitor and interpret dreams? The patient is asked to keep a \"dream log.\" He/she is asked to awaken immediately after a dream and to write down the dream details right away in a notebook kept next to the bed. This is easier said than done, as many people re- member only bits and pieces of a dream upon awakening. Psychoanalysts believe that dreams truly are the mirror to the unconscious and that it is possible to train the self to awaken long enough to record the dream. The dreams are then interpreted in much the same way as free association. Signicant people or situ- ations in the dreams are explored with the patient, and possible meanings are oered by the therapist. Hypnosis Many people are afraid of hypnosis. For many years, it was reputed to be quackery and pre- sented in stage shows in which people did things such as cluck like chickens, which served as entertainment. Granted, this sort of thing can happen. Fraternity and sorority members love to invite stage performers to hypnotize pledgees during rush. Certainly, people like the entertainer David Coppereld have made comfortable livings with hypnosis. Hypnotherapy, as professional therapists prefer to call it, is used for certain people in certain instances. It is not a magic solution to problems. It takes practice on the part of the patient. It can, however, be a very eective tool for unlocking the unconscious or for searching further into a technique called \"past life regression.\" Hypnosis is very deep relaxation. A person who has listened to a relaxation tape and felt the eects of it or who has driven a car and no- ticed that 20 minutes have passed that he or she cannot account for has been hypnotized. In hypnotherapy, the relaxation is guided by the therapist, who has been trained in techniques of trance formation and who then asks certain questions of the patient or uses guided imagery to help picture the sit- uation in an effort to find the cause of the problem (Fig. 8-7). At the end of the session, the therapist will leave some helpful hints for the patient. These are called posthypnoticsuggestions and typically include positive, affirming statements for the patient to think about as well as instructions to help the per- son accomplish self-hypnosis. Of course, just as there are unethical peo- ple in all walks of life, a small number of ther- apists may abuse this relationship, although it is very uncommon. People do not generally lose control when under hypnosis; they will, in most cases, still realize what is comfortable and acceptable to them personally, and they will not allow themselves to go deeper into hypnosis or to perform behaviors that they nd objectionable. Hypnosis and hypnotherapy are discussed in more depth in Chapter 9. Catharsis Catharsis is \"the act of purging\" or \"elimi- nation of a complex (problem) by bringing it to consciousness and affording it expres- sion\" (Merriam-Webster Online, 2013). In psychoanalysis, the therapist helps the pa- tient see the root of the problem and then, by talking or expressing feelings, allows CHAPTER 8|Mental Health Treatments 125 Figure 8-7 In hypnotherapy, a patient in a state of very deep relaxation is guided by the therapist. 2993_Ch08_113-142 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 125the patient to learn to evacuate this problem from the psyche. This can take place in con- junction with other forms of psychotherapy. Psychoanalysis is undertaken on a one- on-one basis between patient and therapist. The nurse can be helpful in the treatment process by allowing the patient to talk about the experiences in therapy and by carefully documenting the patient's responses. Behavior Modification The treatment method known as behavior modication is based on the theories of the behavioral theorists (Skinner, Pavlov, and others). It is a common treatment modality used in multiple treatment settings (Fig. 8-8). The purpose of behavior modication is to eliminate or greatly decrease the frequency of identied negative behaviors. One of the basic beliefs of behavior modication is that whenever a behavior is removed, it must be replaced by another behavior. Therefore, re- placing the negative behaviors with ones that are more desirable is a major function of this type of psychotherapy. As Skinner and Pavlov showed, behaviors can be learned and unlearned. The process of nding the appropriate stimuli and reinforcers determines the eectiveness of the change in behavior. According to some behaviorists, it takes approximately 20 repetitions of a behav- ior to make it a part of a person's lifestyle.However, anyone who has tried to lose weight or stop smoking might have a rebuttal to that theory. Behavior can be changed, according to be- havior modication theory, by either positive or negative reinforcement. Positive reinforce- ment is the act of rewarding the patient with something pleasant when the desired behav- ior has been performed. For instance, if Mrs. P has the habit of using foul language in an attempt to have a need met, it might be assumed that the desired behavior change would be for her to come to a sta member and ask quietly for what she needs. Mrs. P loves to be outside but is not allowed out except at supervised times. A suitable positive reinforcer might be to allow 15 additional minutes outdoors when she remembers to ask for her needs quietly. Generally, when the unacceptable behavior is exhibited by Mrs. P , the sta would either ignore it (because cor- recting it would in itself be a form of rein- forcing the behavior) or quietly tell her that is not acceptable behavior and then acknowl- edge her only when the desired change has been demonstrated.126 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION Variables are manipulated for behavioral changes.

Figure 8-8 Behavior modication. Classroom Activity Write out one behavior you personally would like to change. Include what a person could give you to create a change.2993_Ch08_113-142 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 126Negative reinforcement is interpreted by some as punishment. Great care must be taken when performing behavior modica- tion with certain populations of people. It can look like an infraction of the Patient Bill of Rights and could be reported by someone who does not understand the situation. Negative reinforcement is the act of re- sponding to the undesired behavior by taking away a privilege or adding an unwanted re- sponsibility. Critics of the legal system in this country sometimes cite imprisonment and capital punishment as forms of negative rein- forcement. Parents who \"ground\" a child after the child behaves unacceptably are using neg- ative reinforcement; requiring that child to perform extra household tasks for a stated pe- riod of time is reinforcing the fact that the negative behavior has consequences. The child may not repeat the negative behavior after either of these parental choices. Whatever option is chosen, it is important to have the behaviors and consequences clearly stated. In a facility, this will be incor- porated into the plan of care. At home, it can be stated in family meetings, agreed upon ver- bally by the family members, or made known by some other method of clear communica- tion. The patient must have the ability to un- derstand the ramications of the behavior to be changed and the purpose for the type of consequence that is chosen. If the person is not capable of understanding the situation or is not able to remember due to some other problem, behavior modication could beconsidered a questionable alternative to other kinds of treatment. Cognitive Therapies Rational-Emotive Therapy (RET) Dr. Albert Ellis, a \"reformed\" psychoanalyst, and other cognitive therapists have developed theories proposing that people teach them- selves to be ill because of the way they think about their situations. Cognitive means \"of, re- lating to, or being conscious of mental activity (as thinking, remembering, learning or using language)\" (Merriam-Webster Online, 2013). Cognitive therapy emphasizes ways of rethink- ing situations. The therapist confronts the pa- tient with certain behaviors and then works out ways of thinking about them dierently. Rational-emotive therapy (RET) is one of the best-known cognitive therapies (Fig. 8-9). Dr. Ellis's theory is based on an A-B-C format: A is the activating event, or the subject of the faulty thinking. B is the belief system a person has adopted about the activating event. C is the consequence to continuing the belief system. Dr. Ellis has made up terminology that he uses with his therapy, such as \"musturba- tion\" (the act of insisting that something must go a certain way), \"awfulizing\" (the be- lief that something is not just inconvenientCHAPTER 8|Mental Health Treatments 127 COGNITIVE THERAPY: RATIONAL-EMOTIVE THERAPY (RET) Dr. Albert Ellis USES For any mental health alteration that is consciously controlled.DESIRED OUTCOMES Patient will be able to remain \"undisturbed\" as a result of rethinking activating events, belief system, and consequences.NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Patients will probably not be inpatients.PATIENT TEACHING Perform \"homework.\" Avoid the words but the extreme of \"awful\"), and \"catastrophizing\" (at which point, one has lost control of the situation). In RET, there are no \"musts\" or \"shoulds.\" Feeling sad about an unpleasant experience (such as the death of a loved one) is acceptable and normal, but becoming depressed about the death is \"awfulizing\" and therefore consid- ered by him to be unhealthy. It is common for RET to be performed in groups. The patients are given homework to complete in the period between sessions. The expected outcome is that patients will no longer \"disturb ourselves by the way we think\" (Ellis, 1988). An oshoot of RET is known as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). CBT is behavioral therapy that focuses on examining the rela- tionships between thoughts, feelings, and be- haviors. By exploring patterns of thinking that lead to self-destructive actions and the beliefs that direct these thoughts, people with mental illness can modify their patterns of thinking to improve coping. CBT is a type of psy- chotherapy that is dierent from traditionalpsychodynamic psychotherapy in that the therapist and the patient will actively work to- gether to help the patient recover from the mental illness. People who seek CBT can ex- pect their therapist to be problem-focused and goal-directed in addressing the challenging symptoms of mental illnesses. Because CBT is an active intervention, one can also expect to do homework or practice outside of sessions. RET and other forms of cognitive therapies are gaining in popularity because usually they are signicantly more short-term than psycho- analysis and therefore less costly to the patient. Person-Centered/Humanistic Therapy Theorists Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers are most frequently credited with the concept of person-centered, or humanistic, therapy (Fig. 8-10). In this form of treatment, all caregivers are to focus on the whole person and to work in the \"present.\" It is not impor- tant in humanistic treatment to understand the cause of the problem or what happened in the person's past; what is important is the here and now. Unconditional Positive Regard This is the phrase used by therapists who fol- low Rogerian theory. Unconditional positive regard means full, nonjudgmental acceptance of the patient as a person. It also means that the patient must work at accepting himself or herself. Being self-aware and having feelings128 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Clinical Activity Throughout your clinical experience, observe pa- tients on the unit when they are instructed by the health-care provider that they \"must or should\" behave in a specic manner. During clinical post- conferences, discuss these episodes and whether the outcome was negative. PERSON-CENTERED/ HUMANISTIC THERAPY Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers USES All aspects of patient care. All forms of mental health alterations.DESIRED OUTCOMES Patient will feel accepted as a human, which will allow patient to be self-aware and self-accepting.NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Maintain the three basic qualities of Rogerian theory 1. Empathy 2. Unconditional positive regard 3. Genuineness.PATIENT TEACHING Remain centered in the present. Practice accepting self unconditionally. Figure 8-10 Person-centered/humanistic therapy.2993_Ch08_113-142 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 128that are congruent (equal) to that self-concept are some of the goals of humanistic therapy. Rogers believed that people who care for other people must have three qualities. These qualities are: Empathy (the ability to identify with the patient's feelings without actually experi- encing them with the patient) Unconditional positive regard Genuineness (honesty) Although nurses may not be active partic- ipants in the actual therapy sessions with their patients, it is important for nurses to main- tain these three qualities in all therapeutic re- lationships. When a patient feels betrayed, it usually results in deterioration of the nurse- patient relationship and loss of credibility for the nurse in that situation. Counseling Counseling is licensed and regulated dierently not only state by state, but also sometimes mu- nicipality by municipality (Fig. 8-11). Some states require that a person be prepared at a PhD level to practice therapy independently; in some areas, only certain types of therapy are licensed. Nurses prepared at an LPN/LVN level or at an RN level can, in some localities, practice forms of treatment. It is up to nurses to do the appro- priate research to determine their rights, respon- sibilities, and regulations in their locality, if counseling is a path they wish to pursue. Nurses may be asked or required to accompany their patients to counseling sessions at times. Theymay be asked to facilitate (lead) a group discus- sion sometimes. If nurses have the opportunity, they should take it. It is very interesting to see the dynamics of the group and the way the facilitator guides patients through issues. Pastoral or Cultural Counseling Some people prefer to obtain assistance or counseling from their church or spiritual lead- ers (Fig. 8-12). Sessions are often free, or on a \"free-will\" or \"ability to pay\" status. The person who provides therapy in this time or circum- stance may or may not be trained in traditional mental health theories and modalities. In some Christian faiths, nurses may have an opportunity to serve in ways they could not in a traditional setting. For example, \"parish nurses\" are licensed nurses who work through their church and perform tasks ranging from simply visiting a homebound church member to actu- ally performing care and counseling or referrals for that individual. Depending on the particular church organization, nurses who serve as parish nurses may serve in a volunteer capacity or in a paid position. T raining sessions are oered in some locales for nurses who wish to provide this service, although many churches do not yet re- quire formal training for all their nurses. Nurses may be in a position to counsel pa- tients of their cultural or religious groupsCHAPTER 8|Mental Health Treatments 129 COUNSELING USES All forms of mental health alterations.DESIRED OUTCOMES Patient will gain insight to situation and receive tools to make changes in his or her life.NURSING CONSIDERATIONS May be facilitator.

Here are some examples: Patients who profess Judaism, especially if those individuals observe kosher practices, may have concerns about dietary selections, may refuse to have certain procedures done between sundown Friday and sundown Saturday, and may insist on being admitted to a Jewish hospital if one is available. Patients of Islamic faith follow rituals that may conflict with schedules and routines within the hospital. Prayer times are pro- scribed by their faith and are strictly fol- lowed; therefore, medication times, treatment times, or attendance at therapy may meet with some conflict on the part of that patient. Prayers can be postponed in case of a conflict in schedules. Islamic belief follows holy times that are dierent from the traditional holidays or holy days celebrated in the social calendar in the United States or those traditionally cele- brated within Christianity or Judaism. Also, the patient may have some dietary concerns; those of Islamic faith observe halal practices, which is similar to the Judaism practice of kosher foods. Patients of both faiths may have some concerns with the contents of their medications, such as gel caps. Nurses need to be aware of the potential conflicts between hospital routines and the religious obligations of their patients. Nurses of Islamic faith may nd that one of their challenges working within their belief system is caring for patients of the opposite sex. Women of Islamic faith often wear a hijab (head cov- ering) that completely covers the hair. Some Native American patients may have healing traditions that conflict with tradi- tional Western medicine. Remember that it is not appropriate to label all Native Americans as one group; many tribes have their own unique beliefs and tradi- tions. Shamans, healers, and medicine men are examples of people who may be present in the room with the Native American patient. 130 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing PASTORAL COUNSELING OR CULTURAL COUNSELING USES All forms of mental health alterations.DESIRED OUTCOMES Patient gains tools from a religious/cultural background to be able to make changes in his or her life.NURSING CONSIDERATIONS May act as \"parish nurse\" (or similar title) representative of a specific religion or cultural group in home visits or health facility visits.

Group Therapy Group therapy is a very broad topic. Groups are formed for many reasons; they can be ongoing or short-term, depending on the needs of the patients or the type of disorder. Group therapy can include formal psy- chotherapy groups where patients meet with a therapist regularly as part of their treatment. Self-help programs are also a form of group therapy. For example, Alcoholics Anonymous(AA) and similar 12-step groups are well- established, ongoing groups. They are held not only in the treatment facility, but also in the community. Meeting times are established and published so that people know when and how to access them. As a rule, AA meet- ings are \"closed\" meetings; that is, only alco- holics are welcome. Sometimes, maybe once a month or once quarterly, a meeting is ad- vertised as \"open,\" so that other interested persons (and students) are welcome. Many people who have experienced alcoholism or other chemical dependencies have beneted from this 12-step approach to healing, and it is said that this type of peer group help is theCHAPTER 8|Mental Health Treatments 131 lTable 8-1 Concepts That May Affect Certain Cultural Groups' Seeking or Complying With Mental Health Treatment Caucasian African American Hispanic Native Americans Asian AmericansStigma remains attached to mental illness but is weakening somewhat. Generally have more access to health insurance and to mental health professionals. Tend to be more receptive to taking medications than other groups may be. More likely than whites to receive initial treatment for mental health in emergency rooms (it is thought this may be because this population delays treatment). Approximately 20% of African Americans do not have health insurance. More likely to receive treatment from primary health-care provider rather than a mental health specialist. If any treatment is rendered, it may be substandard. Statistics may be skewed to show overrepresentation of African Americans having mental illness. Mental illness among Hispanics is about equal to that of Caucasians. Currently the highest group not having health insurance. Language barriers. Young Hispanics tend to have higher rates of depression, anxiety disorders, and suicide. Hispanics born in the United States tend to be diagnosed with a mental illness more frequently than those born in Mexico.

Other types of support groups may have dierent formats. Group therapy also includes family ther- apy. Family counseling sessions are often set up with individual therapists with a specialty in the problem area for that family. It is ex- pected that the whole family attend, but there may be times when only certain members are asked to attend or when the individuals will \"break out\" with another therapist and then return to the family group later. Marriage counseling is set up either with an individual counselor or in a group with other couples. Many times, peer counselors are used. These are people who have experienced similar obstacles in their marriage and found creative, eective ways to manage their conflicts (Fig. 8-13). Sometimes, people choose to seek help from a spiritual leader. It is important for us to remember that the therapists and coun- selors are tools. They do not heal the patient; the patient heals himself or herself. Patients must take the suggestions given by the thera- pist, try them, and see what works for them. Nurses can help patients by reinforcing the good work they do in learning to keep them- selves healthy. Nurses can also help by remind- ing patients gently that they do their own healing. Sometimes, when the road to healing gets rocky, patients may use the therapist as a scapegoat. Rather than agree or disagree with the patient, the nurse needs to remember the therapeutic communication skills, empathize with the hard work that is being done by the patient, and encourage the patient to discuss the frustration with the therapist. Electroconvulsive Therapy Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or elec- troshock therapy, as it is sometimes still called, is a form of treatment that is frightening tosome patients. They envision the old movies in which the patient flopped relentlessly on the table. Fortunately, that is a no longer the case. Because of these misperceptions, it is im- portant for health-care providers to educate others (Fig. 8-14). Patients are generally given a sedative before the treatment. Nurses care- fully monitor blood pressure and pulse before and after treatment. The amount of electricity used is individualized to the patient. A treat- ment usually lasts only a few minutes, and if one is slow to look, he or she might miss seeing a patient's so-called convulsion. Often, only a toe or a nger may twitch slightly; there are no more uncontrolled seizures on the treatment table. ECT has a few side eects that can be fairly unpleasant. The patient may feel con- fused and forgetful immediately after the treatment. This can be from a combination of the ECT itself and the pretreatment medica- tion. If there has been a stronger seizure, the132 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Tool Box |Alcohol Anonymous (AA) www.aa.org Clinical Activity Attend an open AA meeting.

Because of the possibility of confusion and forgetfulness, it is common to restrict the pa- tient's activity for 24 hours after a treatment, and it is recommended that the nurse stay with the patient until the patient is oriented and able to care for himself or herself. ECT is not used indiscriminately as it once was. Today, it is used when other therapies have not been helpful, and it is usually reserved for severe or long-term depression and certain types of schizophrenia. The nurse's responsibilities include careful monitoring of vital signs and accurate docu- mentation relating to the patient's subjective and objective response to the treatment. The patient should have nothing by mouth (NPO) for at least 4 hours before a treatment.Reminding the patient to empty his or her bladder and to remove dentures, contact lenses, hairpins, and so on is also important. Ensuring that the patient is kept safe after therapy is also a major concern. Humor Therapy Many studies have been done over the years showing the eects of smiles, hugs, and laughter on mental health as well as physical conditions such as cancer (Fig. 8-15). The movie Patch Adams, based on a real-life doc- tor, portrayed the potential of humor therapy. Viewers saw breakthroughs take place in pa- tients previously thought untreatable. Humor therapy uses many modalities, from clowns to movies to just 10 good \"belly laughs\" daily. Whatever the medium, laughter alters outlooks and neurochemical produc- tion. Patients can show remarkable Figure 8-15 Humor therapy.Figure 8-14 Electroconvulsive therapy.ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY (ECT) USES Depression or schizophrenia that does not respond to other treatments.DESIRED OUTCOMES Patient will state and exhibit appropriate mood and affect or a measurable improvement in mood and affect.NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Monitor vitals before and after treatment. Maintain safety after the treatment. Premedicate if ordered.PATIENT TEACHING May be disoriented after treatment. May lose short-term memory. Side effects last about 24 hours. HUMOR THERAPY USES All forms of mental health alterations and physical conditions.DESIRED OUTCOMES Patients respond and react to the humor. Patients interact. Patients may show improvement in physical condition.NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Assist in determining appropriate patients. Assist in humor \"application.\"PATIENT TEACHING Patient identifies how humor improves situations. Patient helps in seeking out opportunities to apply humor in his or her life.2993_Ch08_113-142 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 133In fact, this kind of intervention has brought responses such as singing, hand clapping, and laughter from dementia patients who do not usually respond to other programming. Smiles are always appropriate. A brave nurse wearing a red rubber nose when walk- ing into the room of an appropriate patient might ease that person's pain\u2014either mental or physical\u2014even if only for a short while. Humor is important for nurses as well as for the patient, since caring for others on a daily basis can create unwarranted stresses. Pet Therapy Pet therapy has been found to reduce stress in patients. Unfortunately, not everyone can have a pet, due to nances, allergies, or living arrangements. The well-renowned Dr. Oz sees pet therapy as a stress reliever, especially for lack of social interaction, such as the loss of a signicant other. Pets are not judgmental. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), pet ther- apy can be used in several health-care settings,including mental health units and long-term care facilities. Pet therapy benets children, adolescents and adults with therapeutic eects.134 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing The danger in humor therapy is that what some people nd funny, others nd oensive. Be sensitive to varied reactions. Remember some people are fearful of clowns.Neeb's Tip lTable 8-2 The Five Phases of Crises Phase Behaviors Precrisis Impact Crisis Adaptive PostcrisisPerson feels \"ne.\" Will often deny stress level and, in fact, state a feeling of well-being. Person feels anxiety and confusion. May have trouble organizing personal life. High stress level. Person will acknowledge feeling stress but may minimize its severity. Person denies problem is out of control. Withdraws or rationalizes behaviors and stress. Uses defense mechanism of projection frequently. This may last varied amounts of time. Crisis is perceived in a positive way. Anxiety decreases. Person attempts to regain self-esteem and is able to start socializing again. Person is able to do some positive problem solving. Surprisingly, both positive and negative functioning may be seen. Person may have developed a more positive, eective way of coping with stress or may show ineective adaptation, such as being critical, hostile, depressed, or may use food or chemicals such as alcohol to deal with what has happened. Crisis Intervention PHASES OF CRISIS Although crisis is a highly individual situa- tion, most experts agree that people experi- encing a crisis pass through the ve phases described in Table 8-2. Crisis can happen at any time to anyone. It can involve one's child, next-door neighbor, or patient. Crisis is dened in several ways. In the health elds, a crisis is a sudden, unexpected event in a person's life that drastically changes his or her routine. Crisis has been dened as a state in which the body is out of homeostasis. It is thought of as a situation in which a person may \"lose control of feelings and thoughts, thus experiencing an extreme state of emo- tional turmoil\" (Shives and Isaacs, 2002). A person in crisis is at risk for physical and emotional harm inflicted by self or by others. After reviewing the various modali- ties for treating mental health disor- ders: if you were using one of the modalities, could you discuss it as easily as if you were talking about a vitamin?Neeb's Tip2993_Ch08_113-142 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 134Examples of people who may be experiencing a crisis are those who have lost a job suddenly or were divorced recently, are in an abusive relationship, have experienced the death of a loved one, or are contemplating or attempt- ing suicide. An important concept to remem- ber is that each person has a dierent set of stressors and a dierent way of dealing with stress. What is a crisis for one person may be simply a minor nuisance for another person. Many employers recognize the potential for crisis and oer some type of employee as- sistance program (EAP). The service is con- dential, and usually the initial call is free to the employee. EAPs vary in what they are able to provide and may act as a referral service for the employee. Nurses should ask the patient if his or her employer provides this benet. GOALS OF CRISIS INTERVENTION Nurses often have the unique opportunity of often being present for the rst three phases of the crisis and not for the outcome (Fig. 8-16). In many agencies, nurses are not involved with longer term treatment, but they may very easily be the ones who walk into the room during a suicide attempt or who may take the call at the nursing station from a distraught parent who is about to hurt his or her child. The goals of crisis intervention change ac- cording to the degree of treatment in which the nurse will be involved. Crisis intervention for the health-care provider is obviously providedat a dierent level than it would be from a law enforcement or emergency dispatch viewpoint. Since this text is meant to be an overview to prepare nurses at an entry level of practice, we will look at the goals of crisis intervention from a health-care perspective. 1.Ensure safety: Assess the situation. If the nurse or the patient is in physical danger, the nurse should signal for help. The nurse should not leave the patient unless danger to the nurse is imminent. It may sound harsh, but the nurse will be no good to anyone if he or she is hurt, or worse. The nurse must take care of his or her own safety, and then take care of the patient's safety. 2.Diuse the situation: Nurses should do this verbally, when at all possible. A person in crisis is most likely not in control of his or her thoughts, feelings, or actions. Physical attempts at restraining or calming are best left until all verbal attempts have been made, and only when there is enough help to do it safely for the patient and the sta. 3.Determine the problem: The nurse should attempt to find out from the patient's viewpoint the cause of the crisis. It is very important that the nurse not push the patient for any reason and remain calm during the intervention. The last thing a patient in crisis needs is a nurse in panic. There is time for nurses to talk about their feelings when the patient is safe.CHAPTER 8|Mental Health Treatments 135 CRISIS INTERVENTION USES For states of extreme emotional or physical turmoil in which patients feel out of control of self or situation.DESIRED OUTCOMES Patient returns to pre-crisis (or higher) level of functioning.NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Assess for the level of crisis patient is experiencing. Assess suicide potential. Use verbal and nonverbal communication skills to diffuse situation.PATIENT TEACHING Determine stressors. Work with new coping techniques. Access support system before stress reaches crisis. Figure 8-16 Crisis intervention.2993_Ch08_113-142 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 1354.Decrease the anxiety level: The nurse's adrenaline level will probably be at an all-time high, but it won't be even close to that of the person in crisis. The nurse should make every attempt to reassure the patient that he or she is in a safe place. The nurse should gently but rmly tell the patient that he or she is con- cerned, wants to help, and will do what- ever is possible to make the situation more comfortable but that the patient's help and cooperation are needed. Caution: Nurses must be very careful with physi- cal contact at this point. Touch as a non- verbal communication skill may be interpreted inaccurately as aggression or sexual innuendo by a patient whose thoughts and feelings are in turmoil. 5.Return the patient to pre-crisis (or better) level of functioning: A nurse may or may not be able to calm the patient to the point that he or she is able to under- stand what just happened. It might take a longer-term session of treatment to help the patient gain that kind of insight. No matter what level of inter- vention the patient requires, the ulti- mate goal is for him or her to learn the skills necessary to cope with stress in a more positive way than before the crisis. Much of that learning will come from the role modeling from the nurses. Quite often the most eective techniques are nonverbal where actions speak louder than words.Crisis, if treated in an appropriate and timely way, is usually temporary. Crisis inter- vention theories are changing to try to keep up with the current concepts of illness. Nevertheless, people will always be experienc- ing crisis. When crisis happens, it is impor- tant that the person who is there to help understand that this is a very frightening time for the person in turmoil. Nurses must understand that they are in a special position as they have some knowledge of crisis and communication skills and are able to help, yet they must always be aware of the legal ramications of intervention. Terrorism September 11, 2001, changed life in the United States. Citizens of the United States became aware of a way of life experienced rou- tinely by some of the country's global neigh- bors. Suicide bombers, anthrax, sarin gas, and tainted water and food sources\u2014American citizens suddenly had a new kind of connec- tion to those in other countries who have been falling victim to terror for generations. Reality was attached to what many Americans knew only from movies or the evening news. That way of life, that behavior, is called terrorism. Terror, according to Webster Online (2013), is \"1: a state of intense fear; 2a: one that in- spires fear, b: a frightening aspect, c: a cause of anxiety, d: an appalling person or thing; 3: violence (as bombing) committed by groups in order to intimidate a population or government into granting their demands.\" Some words, such as fear and anxiety, which are used to dene terrorism are also136 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Critical Thinking Question With a student partner, role-play one or more of the following potential crises (or think up your own). Think about your communication tech- niques. Do they change when dealing with crisis? If so, how? What about your nonverbal communi- cation techniques? Parent whose child has been abducted at the mall Man who calls the clinic, stating he has just killed his wife Woman who is frantically seeking shelter from an abusive relationship You nd a friend of your adolescent daughter slashing her wrists. Alcoholic, the main wage earner for the family, who has just been red from his job Classroom Activity Look in your city's telephone book for agencies that handle crisis intervention. Contact one in person. Inform the agency that this is a school project and you wish to ask them a few ques- tions, such as: Whom does the agency service? What are its hours of operation? How is the agency funded? What does the emergency care cost the patient? Who is its sta? Write a short re- port of your ndings. If possible, appoint some- one to compile all the information so that each student nurse has a \"starter set\" to be able to help others.2993_Ch08_113-142 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 136symptoms of many mental illnesses. Perhaps the most frightening part of this denition is that humans do not always know the source of the terror and thus are unable to defend themselves. They may feel a loss of personal control over their life and safety. It is dicult for adults to accept and deal with what has become an ever-present possibility in what Americans had always assumed was a safe place to live. How, then, do people help their children to process the potential dangers in the world at the same time they are moving through the normal stages of growth and de- velopment? How can people convey the mes- sage that while bad things happen, people are basically good and not to fear them? How do adults, parents, teachers, and health-care professionals prepare to help others who ex- perience crisis, post-traumatic stress, depres- sion, and other potential eects of terror? Suggestions will be oered in various chapters throughout this text; however, to borrow an idea from the sports world, the best defense is a good oense. Nurses need to be ready for the possibility of patients experiencing some eect of terrorism and must be willing to dis- cuss the situation with that patient. As with so many other areas of nursing, it means nurses must take stock of their own thoughts and feelings about the topic. Legal Considerations The Nurse's Perspective: Today's society is a litigious one. It is easy to be tempted to stay uninvolved when people call out for help. In some states, nurses, physicians, and anyone else in the health elds are required by law to help. Some localities require health-care pro- fessionals to post identifying insignia on their vehicles. Most states do not require this yet, but many are considering it. This puts nurses in a sensitive position. Nurses want to help, but nursing curriculum at the entry level pro- vides very little in the way of hands-on crisis intervention techniques. What if something goes wrong? Crisis intervention literature sug- gests that nurses risk a higher liability if they fail to try to help. In other words, it is safer legally for a nurse to do something to help than to do nothing.Exactly what a nurse is able to do depends greatly on his or her locale, level of prepara- tion, state's nurse practice act, and comfort level. Staying within the legal parameter of one's nursing licensure is of major impor- tance; nurses should do only what they know and what is legal. The truth is that anyone can sue anyone for anything. The good news is that most states will nd in favor of the med- ical professional who has, in good faith and in accordance with his or her licensure, made an eort to help a person in a crisis situation. The Good Samaritan law protects nurses as well. The Good Samaritan law does not gen- erally cover nurses within the connes of their employment, however; only when acting to assist in a crisis or emergency situation are nurses protected.CHAPTER 8|Mental Health Treatments 137 The Patient's Perspective: What happens to the patient experiencing the crisis? Because of the nature of crisis, the patient probably does not have a valid insight into the situation. The patient is very likely to be concerned about personal safety. On top of that, fear and in- ability to perceive the situation as it really is will interfere with communication. In most instances, the medical sta will encourage the patient to accept some form of treatment. The patient then has two choices: voluntary or in- voluntary commitment. Voluntary treatment happens when the pa- tient gives informed consent to be hospital- ized or accept some formal treatment program. Informed consent means that the patient has been made aware of his or her be- haviors, the implications of the behaviors, and expectations from the treatment. Informed Remember: Crisis intervention has something in common cardiopul- monary resuscitation (CPR): Once a nurse starts and makes that com- mitment to help, he/she cannot quit until physically unable to continue. Starting to provide help and then changing one's mind can be inter- preted as neglect or abandonment, and in such an instance, the nurse could be found at fault.Neeb's Tip2993_Ch08_113-142 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 137consent can be verbal, nonverbal, or written. Implied consent allows people who are uncon- scious to be treated in such a way as to pre- serve life. If the patient is an adult of legal age who is considered to be competent in the eyes of the law (or an adolescent who has acquired legal emancipation), this patient can also sign himself or herself out at any time. Involuntary commitment varies somewhat from state to state. Many states have the capability to place a \"hold\" on the patient, usually for 48 to 72 hours. During this time, the patient is conned to the treatment set- ting. Usually, a social worker is assigned to visit the patient and act as an advocate for him or her. The goal of the hold period is for the patient to see the need for help with his or her crisis and then consent to voluntary treatment. If, at the end of the hold period, the patient does not consent to treatment, he or she is free to leave the facility, as long as no other manifestation of crisis has sur- faced during the hold. In either instance, patients maintain all civil rights while in the treatment setting. The patient is covered under the Patient'sBill of Rights and most often the patient keeps a copy of the rights. The Community Mental Health Centers Act made provisions for community-based treatment. Communities develop centers and provide treatment according to the needs of the area; not all centers provide all types of treat- ment or 24-hour service. However, the com- munity is supposed to provide some method of emergency psychiatric treatment to help people in crisis as well as those who are chronically mentally ill. These centers can be in the form of freestanding crisis centers or walk-in clinics, and many are connected with the community hospital. In reality though, many communities may have minimal resources to provide these services, so nurses should know what is avail- able in their communities Summary Table 8-3 summarizes treatment modalities that may be used alone or in conjunction with medications to treat a wide variety of mental health issues. The common uses and desired outcomes are covered.138 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing lTable 8-3 Summary of Commonly Used Treatment Modalities Treatment Modality Uses Desired Outcomes Psychotherapy Behavior Modication Rational-Emotive Therapy (RET)/ Cognitive Behavior Therapy(CBT) Person-Centered/ Humanistic1.Patient states improvement in emotional discomfort. 2.

Milieu is the word used to describe the environ- ment of the treatment area. 2.Psychopharmacology is very important to the eective treatment of the patient. There are many classications of psychoac- tive medications and many individual medications within each classication. It is the nurse's responsibility to consult a drug reference regarding all the psychotropic medications they give their patients. It also is part of the nurse's role to reinforce teach- ing about the medications to the patient. 3.Psychotherapy, sometimes in conjunction with medications, is often used to treat patients. There are several methods of psy- chotherapy, including psychoanalysis, be- havior or person- centered, therapy. 4.Counseling is carried out in different ways, depending on the patient's needsand type of illness. Counselors may be licensed and the nurse's role in counsel- ing regulated differently from state to state and municipality to municipality. Counseling is given individually or in group settings, according to the situation. 5.ECT is used for specic situations. Pre- medication is usually ordered. It is the role of the nurse to monitor vital signs, maintain safety, and document post- treatment observations. 6.Crisis intervention is very individualized. Crisis has ve phases, and each person experiences them dierently. 7.Employee support systems are becoming more accessible through employers. They are condential and free or reasonably priced. 8.Pastoral or cultural counseling may be the treatment of choice for an individual. Nurses must do all they can to help the patient receive care that is personally meaningful.2993_Ch08_113-142 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 139140 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing CASE STUDY Andrea, an emergency room nurse from San Diego, is on vacation with her friend. Andrea selected a road trip to a major theme park. There are two adults and two children in the vehicle. They are about minutes from the gate, Andrea sees smoke on the horizon. The radio in the vehicle alerts Andrea and her friend that the theme park has just experienced an explosion. Details are sketchy, but there are numerous injuries. The park has been closed. As Andrea and her friends approach what was the entrance to the park, they witness many individuals running, injured, and crying. People are on re and rolling. There is a very unpleas- ant odor. Police, reghters, and rst responders are directing Andrea and her friend away from the site. Andrea tells them she is a nurse and oers to help. At this moment, her help is not wanted, but all are directed to a \"holding\" area. The children, whose ages are 4 and 13 (Olivia and T rinity), are crying and asking Andrea questions about the smoke. If you were Andrea, what would your emotional response be? How would you answer and calm the children? After a few minutes, the police accept Andrea's oer to help the wounded. The children become hysterical at Andrea's leav- ing the vehicle, yet Andrea feels responsible to help. What should Andrea do? What stages of crisis is she experiencing? REFERENCES CNN.com/Health.

For some patients, conven- tional Western medicine is not the only course. Many factors aect a patient's choice of treatment modalities; education, experi- ence, economic status, belief system, and culture are a few considerations. There are many other means of treating ill- ness and promoting good health in addition to traditional medicine. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) presents additional options. In general, alternative practices/medicines replace those of conven- tional medicine, and complementary methods are used together with traditional treatments. Many of these have been used for centuries. These present dierent choices to the phar- maceutical products dispensed at the local pharmacy. Often, these methods dier con- siderably from what is acceptable medical care in Western culture. Complementary or alter- native methods may lack extensive scientic research to prove their eectiveness or even their safety according to the standards of con- ventional medicine.

An alternative practice, for example, would be to use an herbal preparation to combat de- pression instead of physician-ordered prescrip- tion medication. A complementary treatment might consist of using biofeedback to reduce the symptoms of anxiety associated with men- tal illness while the patient continues to par- ticipate in psychotherapy and take antianxiety medications. Both approaches address a key concept in alternative and complementary medicine: the mind-body connection. Mind, Body, and Belief The ways in which people's minds and bodies are interconnected stretch beyond the obvious physical world in which people live. First, there is the brain, an organ directly connected to the body by tissue such as nerves and blood vessels. The brain is contained within the bony cavity of the skull, which constitutes its protection and support. The mind represents the cognitive, emotional, and logical re- sponses that make people individual human beings. The mind is clearly more than just the brain, the sum of its cells, chemicals, electrical activity, and connections. It may seem strange to think that there was ever a question about the interconnectedness of the mind and the body. It has long been known that disease aects the mind, but con- ventional medicine has only recently started to accept that the reverse is also true, that the mind aects the disease. People's thoughts and emotions aect the way their bodies function, even on a cellular level. This holistic view makes complementary and alternative medicine increasingly popular choices for the treatment of all types of illness, including mental disorders. Important to the eectiveness of any type of treatment are the patient's beliefs. Nursing requires respect for the beliefs and values of other people and cultures as fundamental to good practice. It is useful to remember that everyone has a dierent way of viewing the world. Everyone forms models of the worldbased on beliefs, values, education, and expe- rience. Models are pictures or ideas that peo- ple form in their minds to explain how things work. Models help people understand and interact with others and their environment, and they help people to formulate beliefs. To a large extent, a person's beliefs will de- termine the success of a given treatment. This can be plainly seen when a placebo medica- tion is given and is eective in relieving symp- toms like severe pain, even though the placebo is no more than a sugar pill. This illustrates that what the patient believes and expects the placebo to do can be more important than the actual composition of the tablet. Even though the nurse might not be directly involved in the application of a com- plementary or alternative treatment, support- ing the patient's cultural and belief systems is an important role in helping him or her move forward on a path to wellness. Each patient will have a dierent level of acceptance of various complementary and alternative approaches. How nonjudgmental, open, and accepting of dierent ideas for the success of the dierent methods is up to the patient. The nurse can ease that process by also remaining nonjudg- mental, open, and accepting and at the same time being aware of any safety concerns for the patient. As always, the boundaries of legal and acceptable nursing practice vary from state to state. Nurses need to check with their state's board of nursing or other regulating agencies to determine acceptable standards of practice in regard to using alternative, integrative, and complementary therapies. Common Complementary and Alternative Treatments Biofeedback Stress-related anxiety is the common element of disorders relating to mental illness. It is known that the direct eects of sustained stress can be devastating (see Chapter 7, Coping and Defense Mechanisms). In a critical moment or progressively over time, the biological response to stress can impair the cognitive function of144 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing2993_Ch09_143-156 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 144the mind and cloud a person's thinking. Pro- longed stress can lead to emotional anguish that is experienced as fear, anxiety, anger, and depression. Prolonged stress can also lead to exhaustion and possible death. Anxiety con- tributes to physical symptoms\u2014many of which can be reduced or controlled by biofeedback techniques. Biofeedback is a training program designed to develop one's ability to control the autonomic nervous system. While biofeedback only recently has become a complementary medical therapy, it has been widely accepted by traditionalists in the West because of its use of scientic measuring devices and proven techniques. The primary purpose of biofeedback train- ing is to teach patients to recognize tension within the body and to respond with relax- ation (Fig. 9-1). Typically, training for patients takes place in a series of one-hour ses- sions, sometimes spaced a week apart. The patient is taught to obtain a deep level of relaxation as a means to control a light, buzzer, image, or a video game, to which he or she is attached by electrodes and cables. The machine is then gradually adjusted to greater sensitivity, and the patient learns improved control. When training is com- pleted, all that is needed to obtain relaxation and symptom resolution at any time or place is recall of the particular thought and feeling that worked in the clinic.Biofeedback is being used with good results for conditions including insomnia, some types of seizures, functional nausea and vomiting, tinnitus, and phantom limb pain. As with other forms of therapy, biofeedback practitioners must be aware of functional or even psychological symptoms that are actually caused by organic problems and require dif- ferent treatment. It may not be appropriate to use biofeedback to treat extreme or acute states of mental illness, like severe depression, mania, agitation, schizophrenia, paranoia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), delir- ium, and identity or dissociative disorders. Critics have pointed out that the major eects from biofeedback can be more economical and easily obtained through relaxation training. Patients with strong faith they can influ- ence their own health are the most likely to be successful at mastering biofeedback. The experience of gaining control of one's physical reactions can have a tremendous eect on how the person will view stressful situations in the future. As an educational tool for more skeptical patients, learning biofeedback can demonstrate that they have a great deal more control over their responses and symptoms than they rst expected. Aromatherapy Aromatherapy may well be one of the oldest methods used to treat illness in human beings. Related to herbal therapy, aromather- apy provides treatment by both the direct pharmacological eects of aromatic plant sub- stances and the indirect eects of certain smells on mood and aect. Throughout human history and in many cultures, there are accounts of the use of aromatics to treat varying forms of illness. Applied in salves or ointments, used in incense, reduced to essential oils for topical application, or even ingested, these substances often appeal to patients who are seeking a \"natural\" approach to healing People's response to the sense of smell has strong signicance in their lives. People asso- ciate certain aromas with certain situations, conditions, and emotional states. Many indi- viduals are able to relive particularly strong memories when exposed to an aroma that was present when the remembered event occurred.CHAPTER 9|Complementary and Alternative Treatment Modalities 145 Figure 9-1 Biofeedback training teaches patients to recognize tension and respond with relaxation.

The ability for a particular smell to create positive alter- ations in mood makes aromatherapy attractive to many people and has created a large market in everyday products designed to evoke calm and well-being. Scented candles and personal care products like bath oils, shampoos, and body lotions are especially popular. T reatment for anxiety-based mental illness and depression using aromatics like lavender, thyme, gardenia, and other botanicals is be- coming a more acceptable adjunct to conven- tional methods. It is important to be aware that the oils and plant matter used in aro- matherapy can be toxic if improperly admin- istered and should be kept out of the reach of children and the cognitively impaired. Applied to skin, many plant oils are caustic or can trigger an allergic reaction. The nurse should observe and assess to determine if the products used are eective and if there are any side eects noted. As with all alternative treat- ment, it is advisable to nd a competent and knowledgeable practitioner to benet fully from the potential of aromatherapy.also perceived by the public to be better, or safer, because they can be purchased over the counter and do not require a trip to the doc- tor's oce. There are literally hundreds of products available to consumers seeking relief through herbal and nutritional means. 146 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Classroom Activity Bring several dierent aromatic herbs into class, pass them around, and have each student sni the plant or a form of the plant. Students should discuss their immediate feelings after inhaling the aromas. Herbal and Nutritional Therapy Growing steadily in the United States today is the use of herbal compounds and nutri- tional supplements to treat illness. The pop- ularity of self-treatment with herbs is in large part due to the desire of many people to return to a simpler lifestyle and as a means to avoid costly prescription medications. Most herbal products are considered nutritional supplements rather than medications, so these products avoid regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They are Belief plays a considerable role in the acceptance and use of these products.Neeb's Tip With rapid changes in society since World War II has come people's awareness that their lives are no longer as pastoral, calm, and idyl- lic as they would like to remember them to be. This awareness became more evident after the events of September 11, 2001. In a world full of processed food, the quality of modern nutrition has come into question, and there is growing conviction that articial additives lack the ability to provide the basics needed for good health. Daily, people are assured in the popular press and the news media that the solution to many of their problems can be found in nutritional and herbal supplements. Lack of cortisol has been blamed for weight gain, and taking compounds rich in HGH (human growth hormone) has been credited with reversing aging. Infomercials tout the benets of taking coral calcium and even improving sexual performance with herb-based prepara- tions. The Internet is flooded with supple- ments that promise to improve people's lives by making them healthier and stronger. Some herbs have been researched and proven in their eectiveness in treating disease conditions. This should not be surprising, for many modern medications were developed from herbal and other botanical origins. Native Americans knew the value of the inner bark of the willow tree, gathered and used for its ability to reduce fever and ease pain. They also used foxglove in their sweat lodges to energize the frail and restore vitality to the elderly. Little did they know that the salicylate in willow bark and digitalis in foxglove were the reasons for their eectiveness. There is a tradition in Europe of using herbal medications and nutritional supple- ments to treat disease. For example, people in2993_Ch09_143-156 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 146Germany routinely plant and harvest herbs in their garden plots to create remedies for com- mon ailments. Some herbal preparations are available there only by a doctor's prescription, and others can only be obtained through a licensed pharmacist. In the United States, the use of fresh or garden-grown herbs is discour- aged because of the diculty in determining the strength of the active compounds pro- duced by plants under dierent growing con- ditions. Europeans are guided by generations of experience and practice to safely use avail- able botanicals. Unfortunately, the belief in the relative safety of herbs is a misunderstanding that has caused much concern among health-care providers. Deciding on an appropriate dose is dicult, because herbal preparations do not have to conform to any specic guidelines regulating strength or purity. People tend to think that if a small amount of the product is eective, more is better still. Some herbs are very toxic, particularly in pure form. Many herbs interact negatively with prescription medications. This point demonstrates the need for the nurse to include direct questions to the patient about the use of any CAMs. Nurses need to be able to teach their patients the importance of consulting with a physician before beginning any sort of herbal therapy. Table 9-1 describes the ve most often used herbal medications and nutritional supple- ments in the treatment of mental illness in this country.Massage, Energy, and Touch Widespread among complementary and alternative treatment methods are modalities centered on manipulating the body's energy elds. Massage in one form or another has probably been known to man since before the dawn of history. Touch and movement are es- sential to life and well-being in both physical and psychological ways. Massage is the manipulation of the body using methodical pressure, friction, and kneading. People are shaped, almost literally, by their childhood experiences of touching. An infant has limited sensory discrimination but will react posi- tively to being cuddled and held, and even to the feel of a snugly wrapped blanket.CHAPTER 9|Complementary and Alternative Treatment Modalities 147 During the admission interview, ask the patient if he or she is taking any alternative or complementary products. Some of these may be contraindicated with medications ordered by the physician.Neeb's Tip Tool Box |The National Institutes of Health division called the National Center for Comple- mentary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) is an excellent resource for obtaining informa- tion on a specic CAM, including scientic data if available. This is available at www.nccam.nih.gov/Tool Box |Types of Massage Therapy www.massagetherapy.com/glossary/index .php Massage has evolved into many variations as a result of its success (Fig. 9-2). Use of touch is common to many dierent treatment approaches, but there can be great variation in philosophical, theoretical, and practical ideas about how touch is applied. Western variations of massage include Swedish, which was developed in the early nineteenth century and is the type most people are familiar with. It is characterized by long, smooth strokes that go toward the direction of the heart. The manipulation of specic body sites to relax muscle groups is known as trigger point massage. Conventional medical science has generated a similar trigger point therapy in which injections of steroids are applied at these key areas in place of massage to both relax the muscle group and reduce local in- flammation. Of course, there are also other means of massage available. Rolng is a therapy de- signed to realign the body with gravity through fascial manipulation, a vigorous form of bodywork that is nding increasing accept- ance. Eastern massage traditions have fol- lowed a dierent path. It is widely believed among Eastern practitioners that the body is governed by energy paths, called meridians. This energy is perceived as the life force, or2993_Ch09_143-156 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 147lTable 9-1 Common mg PO daily, depending on what is treated; divide into 2-3 equal doses 10-110 mg PO dried kava extract three times daily, or freshly prepared kava beverages, 400-900 g weeklyUses Short-term memory loss though research is conflicting as to benets Antidepressant, antianxiety, antipsychotic, to use as sleep aideSide Effect Bleeding, contact dermatitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache; rarely, subdural hematoma, seizures (especially in children) Drowsiness, changes in reflex and judgment, nausea, muscle weakness, blurred vision, decreased platelet counts, decreased urea and bilirubin levels, Contra- Indications Pregnant or breast- feeding, children; breastfeeding Skin yellow- ing from accumula- tion of plant pigment can occur in chronic use.

When the life force is obstructed, emotional and physical illnesses result. Various types of pressure, massage, and other techniques are employed along these meridians to release the flow of chi, restore balance, and improve health. Shiatsu is aJapanese form of acupressure that uses pres- sure from the ngers to free energy flow. Reflexology is also based upon the belief that energy pathways and zones cross the body, connecting vital organs and body parts (Fig. 9-3). Reflexologists use massage of the feet to act upon these pathways, unblocking and renewing the energy flow. Therapeutic touch also deserves mention. Reiki is representative of methods of touch healing that are often associated with mas- sage. Reiki is a term that means \"universal life energy\" and refers to the process whereby this energy is drawn along the body's meridians. Unlike methods that use physical movement, pressure, or massage to unblock these chan- nels, Reiki uses the flow of life energy itself to accomplish the task. Practitioners are \"attuned\" to the energy channels and can manipulate them hands-on, hands just above the body, or even at a distance. Reiki tech- niques can even be employed as part of a more traditional massage session to enhance the physical benets of the massage. Reiki has been demonstrated to increase warmth in the areas being treated and also to produce relax- ation in the subject.150 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing Figure 9-2 Massage can be an effective tool for relieving tension.

Hypnosis is a means for entering an altered state of consciousness, and in this state, using visualization and suggestion to bring about desired changes in behavior and thinking. Called trance, people enter this state of focused attention every day. The Eng- lish language even contains references to this common experience of \"zoning out.\" T rance is not sleep but rather describes a state of mind wherein a person is less aware of what is going on around him or her and instead is very focused on an internal experience, like a memory or an imagined event. Everyone responds to suggestion to some extent. A person who is watching television and wants a snack after seeing commercials for a favorite fast-food restaurant has responded to suggestion. Fortunately, people's minds l- ter out suggestions that are unacceptably dan- gerous so they are not persuaded to imitate some of the more unsafe things seen on TV. hypnosis. In some states a therapist must be certified or licensed, but in others no one but a psychologist, psychiatrist, medical doc- tor, or other professional may practice the techniques. Milton H. Erickson, M.D. (1901-1980), was one of the best-known gures in the development of hypnosis for modern therapeu- tic purposes. Dr. Erickson was a victim of polio, which left him partially paralyzed. He had little strength in his arms and upper body and was conned to a wheelchair. As if that were not enough, he was dyslexic, tone-deaf, color-blind, and had heart problems. Left alone during long periods of illness, Erickson became a master of observation and learned that subtle changes in facial expression, skin color, nuance of voice, and physical posture could tell him much about a person's inner state. Dr. Erickson structured his therapeutic approach to patients in a new way. He refused to allow his own past disabilities ruin his living of life to its fullest and therefore refused to let old problems get in the way of his patients' enjoyment of living. Erickson ignored the past history of presenting patients, preferring instead to focus on present and future out- comes. In one classic case, Erickson gave the task of tending violets to a woman with depres- sion. Combined with other therapeutic sugges- tions, she was kept too busy and involved in her community to remain depressed. T raditional hypnotherapy and psychother- apy center on diagnosing problems and treat- ing symptoms. Erickson promoted well-being, and study of his methods has challenged a whole new generation of hypnotherapists to do the same. Later, John Grinder and Richard Bandler would develop the eld of neurolin- guistic programming (NLP), based in large part upon their study of the extraordinary sensory acuity of Milton Erickson. Neurolinguistic Programming Investigating the techniques and methods of many successful therapists, Bandler and Grinder searched for ways to make psy- chotherapy more consistently eective. It was through these explorations that they realized that language cues could be used to under- stand how an individual experiences his or herCHAPTER 9|Complementary and Alternative Treatment Modalities 151 A hypnotherapist uses suggestion, both direct and indirect, to help the patient create change.Neeb's Tip The general public has been subjected to an enormous amount of misinformation about hypnosis by stage hypnotists, movies, and books. As a result, hypnotherapy is widely misunderstood and wrongly feared by many people. Watching a stage hypnotist appear to make a volunteer cluck like a chicken or dance on a table certainly does not inspire con- dence in hypnosis as a therapeutic tool. It is very hard for some people to overcome these fears, especially the stubborn belief in the myth that hypnosis is somehow \"mind con- trol\" exercised for evil (or entertainment) pur- poses by the therapist. Whereas some researchers and practition- ers contend that hypnosis cannot stand on its own as a treatment modality, others are equally convinced that even lay practitioners can deliver effective therapy with a mini- mum of training and practice. No doubt this controversy will continue, as there are at present few regulations governing the use of2993_Ch09_143-156 14/01/14 5:20 PM Page 151world. Using those cues, a practitioner can help patients change their experiences and re- spond to problems in a dierent way. Unlike traditional hypnosis, neurolinguistic pro- gramming (NLP) does not use lengthy trance sessions and instead depends upon patients to take an active part in their treatment. When John Grinder and Richard Bandler began de- veloping NLP , they based this extraordinary new type of therapy on a basic set of ideas, or presuppositions. Presuppositions are the assumptions peo- ple make when forming communication. They are most often not spoken or written, but understood within the context of what is being communicated. For example, if the statement \"I am so happy today!\" is made, the presupposition, or unspoken assumption, is that the speaker is not normally happy. Peo- ple's daily communications are lled with such assumptions, things that they take for granted. NLP diers from other therapies in that there is no presupposition that the pa- tient is somehow \"broken\" and requires \"x- ing.\" Instead, practitioners are taught that patients are whole individuals who already possess the internal resources they need to re- cover from their illness. All that is required is to direct the patient to those resources and enable their use.People observe their world through distinct channels of experience, tending to prefer one channel over another, but eventually using them all for important cues and sensory information about their environment and other people. Primary Sensory Representation The three primary methods of sensory repre- sentation are the visual, auditory, and kines- thetic channels (seeing, hearing, and touching). Of course, people also use taste and smell to gather information, but these paths are rarely the most important channel, and they are gen- erally ignored. Paying attention to speech patterns gives the practitioner a starting point for meaning- ful communication with the patient. The most obvious way to do this is to listen to the predicates a person uses while describing thoughts and ideas. The practitioner can then determine positive rapport if the person favors sight, hearing, or touch and match those predicates, using the same language pat- terns to create a starting point for meaningful communication. Recognizing these patterns can help improve a nurse's communication with patients. Table 9-2 illustrates types of word patterns people use.152 UNIT 1|Foundations for Mental Health Nursing lTable 9-2 Representational System Predicates Visual (Seeing) Auditory (Hearing) Kinesthetic (Touch) an eyeful clear as a bell all washed up appears to me clearly expressed boils down to beyond the shadow call on chip o the old block of a doubt bird's-eye view describe in detail come to grips with catch a glimpse of earful control yourself clear cut express yourself cool, calm, collected dim view give an account of rm foundations eye to eye give me your ear get a handle on get a perspective on grant an audience get in touch with scope out heard voices hand in hand hazy idea hidden message hang in there horse of a dierent color hold your tongue hold on2993_Ch09_143-156 14/01/14 5:20 PM Predicates\u2014cont'd Visual (Seeing) Auditory (Hearing) Kinesthetic (Touch) in light of idle talk hold it in view of inquire into keep your shirt on make a scene keynote speaker know how mental image loud and clear lightheaded mind's eye manner of speaking moment of panic naked eye pay attention to pain in the neck paint a picture power of speech pull some strings photographic memory outspoken sharp as a tack plainly seen rings a bell slipped my mind pretty as a picture to tell the truth start from scratch sight for sore eyes unheard of underhanded under pressure Of course, just about everyone uses all three forms of predicates at one time or another. The most important thing to remember is to match the dominant, or most used, form. EXAMPLES (Visual) Mary: \"I can't picture myself getting any better.\" Nurse: \"In light of your progress, see your- self going back to school. How does that look to you?\" (Auditory) James: \"I've heard that the doctor is tuned in to the newest treatments.\" Nurse: \"He can describe those in detail to you. I'll tell him you want to hear about them.\" (Kinesthetic) Diane: \"I couldn't come to grips with the situation. I was under too much pres- sure all the time.\" Nurse: \"It is hard to get in touch with what's important when you feel that way.\" These exchanges demonstrate communica- tion on more than one level. By using the same language used by the patient, the nurse can establish that she or he is listening closelyto the message that is being sent. This is a powerful tool in creating and maintaining rapport, the foundation to a therapeutic relationship. Clinical Activity Interact with a patient to determine if the person favors sight, hearing, or touch. Afterward, commu- nicate with patient on his or her level. In post- conference, share with fellow students if this enhanced your rapport with the patient. Summary Nursing practice is evolving and is incorpo- rating \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" ther- apies into traditional care delivery systems (Table 9-3). State boards of nursing can determine at what level and scope of practice nurses should provide the alternative therapy.

Alternative modali- ties are used instead of, and complemen- tary are used in addition to, conventional practices. 2.The mind-body connection is an impor- tant concept in all types of medical treat- ment. Disease and wellness aect the whole person. Holistic treatments ad- dress both the illness and the person. 3.An individual has beliefs, based upon his or her model of the world. These beliefs must be respected by the nurse. 4.Anxiety is common to disorders relating to mental illness. Prolonged stress and anxiety lead to physical as well as mental and emotional aictions. 5.Biofeedback is a technique that teaches the patient to recognize and control stress responses in the body. It is widely accepted because of its use of scientic measuring devices to demonstrate the eectiveness of the treatment. 6.Aromatherapy uses a person's emotional response to smell as well as the pharma- cological eects of various fragrant botan- ical and other substances to treat illness. 7.Herbal and nutritional therapies are be- coming more prevalent as the public em- braces \"natural\" healing. Many modern medications have evolved from unculti- vated botanical products. Relative safety and eectiveness is still in question, as the industry is largely unregulated, with no set standards for these products. 8.Other types of alternative and comple- mentary therapy focus on manipulation, strengthening, and removing blockage from the free flow of energy in the human body. Massage and therapeutic touch modalities are successful groups of both stand-alone and adjunctive treatment for disease. 9.Hypnotherapy and neurolinguistic programming are two prominent modalities that address mental and bod- ily illness by empowering change in the patient's thought patterns. Both tightly focus on communication patterns and the patient-therapist relationship. REFERENCES Complementary and alternative medicine. (2009). In D.

Stress is everywhere in today's society. Most often, stress is associated with negative situations, but the good things that happen to people, such as weddings and job promotions, also produce stress. This stress from positive experiences, such as becoming newly married, promoted at work, or some- thing similar, is called eustress. It can produce just as much anxiety as the negative stressors. A stressor is any person or situation that pro- duces anxiety responses. Stress and stressors are dierent for each person; therefore, it is impor- tant that the nurse ask what the stress produc- ers are for that patient. What is extremely stressful for one person (driving in rush hour trac, for example) might be relaxing to some- one else (go with the trac flow and relax after a busy day). Anxiety can be described as an uncomfort- able feeling of dread that is a response to ex- treme or prolonged periods of stress. According to Gorman and Sultan (2008), anxiety is an unpleasant feeling of tension, apprehension, and uneasiness or a diuse feeling of dread or unexplained discomfort. The four commonly accepted levels of anxiety are: Mild Moderate Severe Panic Hildegard Peplau teaches that a mild amount of anxiety is a normal part of being human and that it is necessary to change and develop new ways of coping with stress (Fig. 10-1). Anxiety may also be influenced by one's culture. It may be acceptable for some people to acknowledge and discuss stress, but others may believe that one should keep personal problems to oneself. This can be a challenge to the nurse during an assessment. Anxiety is usually referred to in one of two ways: free-floating anxiety and signal anxiety. Free-floating anxiety is described as a feeling of impending doom. The person might say some- thing like \"I just know something bad is going to happen if I go on vacation,\" without knowing when or where the event might occur. Signal anxiety, on the other hand, is an uncomfortableresponse to a known stressor (e.g., \"Finals are only a week away and I've got that nagging nau- sea again.\"). Both types of anxiety are involved in the various anxiety disorders. Nurses working with children and teenagers must be aware that they also experience anxiety and stress. They may not be able to verbalize their feelings, and they may display symptoms dierently than adults do. Some indicators of stress and anxiety in these age groups include decline in school performance, changes in eat- ing habits and sleeping patterns, and with- drawal from friends and usual activities. Nurses can be instrumental in screening children and adolescents for signs of anxiety. The Diagnostic & Statistical Manual, 5th edition (DSM-5, 2013) has made a number of revisions to anxiety disorders from the 4th edition known as DSM-IV-TR (2000). These will be noted in this chapter. In DSM-5, some disorders that were previously listed as anxiety disorders, including post- traumatic stress disorder and obsessive com- pulsive disorder, have now been listed under new categories. In this text these will be discussed in the section \"Types of Anxiety and Anxiety-Related Disorders\" in this chapter.160 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Figure 10-1 Anxiety ranges in severity from mild through panic. \"The Scream,\" a famous painting by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, depicts a person in a very high state of anxiety.2993_Ch10_157-180 14/01/14 5:21 PM Page 160Etiology of Anxiety and Stress Psychoanalytic theory says that there is a con- flict between the id and the superego, which causes anxiety. At some time in the individual's development, this conflict was repressed but emerged again in adulthood. When conflict emerges, patients realize they have \"failed,\" and the manifestations of anxiety are once again felt. Biologically the basic stress response is called the ght-or-flight response and contributes to feelings of anxiety. In this response to stress the blood vessels constrict because epinephrine and norepinephrine have been released. Blood pres- sure rises. If the body adapts to the stress, hor- mone levels adjust to compensate for the epinephrine-norepinephrine release, and the body functions return to homeostasis. If the body does not adapt to the stress, there are many long-term health problems that can be created including lowered immunity, heart dis- ease, and many other conditions (Fig. 10-2). Studies are continually being conducted try- ing to correlate the condition of stress to phys- ical illness. In 2002, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh (Cohen, 2003) studied 334 paid individuals. They introduced a rhinovirus into the participants' noses. Thenthey placed the participants into individual, private hotel rooms. Several days later, they tested the individuals for symptoms. People who had described themselves as happier, con- tented types of personalities demonstrated cold/flu symptoms only one third as often as the individuals who did not use those kinds of words to describe themselves and their stress level. This is one study. Experts do not know all of the variables, but it does make a fairly strong argument for a positive correlation between emotional stress and physical illness. The LPN/LVN will frequently encounter stress in medical-surgical patients. Physical and emotional symptoms can interrelate. It is im- portant for nurses to recognize the relationship between physical and emotional responses to stress. Nurses can be instrumental in gaining accurate planning and interventions for their patients by providing accurate assessment and documentation of the patient's symptoms as his or her body adapts to stress. Table 10-1 gives examples of medical conditions and the eects of the body's adaptation response to stress. Differential Diagnosis Dierentiating normal anxiety from an anxiety disorder can be challenging. Because so many symptoms are associated with anxiety disorders, it is important for people to have a complete physical workup before being checked for these disorders. The symptoms of anxiety disorders are listed with each of the specic disorders (see section \"Types of Anxiety Disorders\"). Symp- toms of anxiety disorders can mimic those seen in diabetes, cardiac problems, medication side eects, electrolyte imbalances, or physical trauma. The physician must rule out a systemic infection or an allergy that might be related to chills or swallowing diculty. Hot flashes, which can occur in some anxiety states, could be related to a fever or to menopause. The physician must always consider the possibility of drug or alcohol abuse as partial causes for the symptoms. Certainly, more than one condition can occur simultaneously. A psychiatric evalu- ation is often needed to conrm a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Common symptoms of anxiety can be present in many other conditions. It is easy to see how mistakes in diagnosing can happen.CHAPTER 10|Anxiety, Anxiety-Related, and Somatic Symptom Disorders Blood vessels constrict Norepinephrine and epinephrine released and blood pressure risesCRISIS Immune system becomes challenged Lymph nodes increase in size Potential for cardiac and renal failure Death may occurEXHAUSTION Hormone levels adjust Body functions return to homeostasisADAPTATION OR Figure 10-2 General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) model of stress.2993_Ch10_157-180 14/01/14 5:21 PM Page 161162 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health lTable 10-1 Adaptation Responses to Stress and the Outcome of Stress on the Body Stress-Related Body's Adaptation Outcome of Stress Medical Condition to the Stress on the Body Lowered Immunity Burnout Migraine, Cluster, and Tension Headaches Hypertension Coronary Artery Disease Cancer AsthmaInterferes with eectiveness of the body's antibodies; possibly related to interactions among the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, adrenal glands, and the immune system.

In this chapter, revisions from DSM-IV-TR will be mentioned periodically as a comparison. Types of Anxiety and Anxiety-Related Disorders Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) In generalized anxiety disorder , the anxiety (also referred to as \"excessive worry\" or \"severe stress\") itself is the expressed symptom. It is2993_Ch10_157-180 14/01/14 5:21 PM Page 162diagnosed when excessive worry is related to two or more things and lasts 6 months or longer. Patients who have GAD may display any number of symptoms. The DSM-IV-TR lists 18 symptoms of anxiety, and the patient must show six or more in order to be considered to have GAD. DSM-5 has reduced the symp- toms to include at least 3 of the following: Restlessness Easily fatigued Diculty concentrating or mind going blank Irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbances These symptoms become pervasive as the person is unable to control the worry and other symptoms. All aspects of life become in- volved. This disorder can be debilitating.CHAPTER 10|Anxiety, Anxiety-Related, and Somatic Symptom Disorders 163 Generalized anxiety disorder can be paralyzing and impact all areas of a person's life. Neeb's Tip Panic Disorder Panic disorder is a recurrent condition that is a state of extreme fear that cannot be controlled. It is an abrupt surge of intense fear or discom- fort that reaches a peak in a short period of time. It can lead to intense fear and worry about it happening again. It is also referred to as \"panic attack,\" and people may not consider it to be a serious disorder initially. In the past, panic disorder was linked to agoraphobia. DSM-5 now has them as two separate disorders. Some traits of panic disorder include: Fear (usually of dying, losing control of oneself, or of \"going crazy\") Dissociation (a feeling that it is happening to someone else or not happening at all) Nausea Diaphoresis Chest pain Increased pulse Shaking Unsteadiness Feelings of being suocated or unable to catch one's breath Panic symptoms can develop sud- denly and unexpectedly in the sus- ceptible person. People with history of panic disorder need to be pre- pared to identify early signs in the hope that they can gain some con- trol before the symptoms are out of control.Neeb's Tip Phobia This is the most common of the anxiety disor- ders. Phobia is dened as an \"irrational fear.\" The person is very aware of the fear and even of the fact that it is irrational, but the fear contin- ues. People develop phobias to many dierent things\u2014approximately 700 dierent things, in fact (Box 10-1). Snakes, spiders, enclosed spaces, and the number 13 are some of the more com- mon phobias (Fig. 10-3). People also develop phobias of things such as caring for their chil- dren (because they might hurt them) and eating in places other than their own home. The psychoanalytic view of phobias that the fear is not necessarily from the object itself but rather a displaced, unconscious fear that is displaced on the object/event such as a snake or height. Learning theory views pho- bias as learned responses. When the person avoids the phobic object, fears is escaped and that is a powerful reward. Most phobias start in childhood but people can develop them later in life. In older people it is common is see fear of falling or choking. lBox 10-1 Some Common Specific Phobias Acrophobia: Fear of height Ailurophobia: Fear of cats Carcinomatophobia: Fear of cancer Decidophobia: Fear of making decisions Nyctophobia: Fear of darkness Odontophobia: Fear of teeth or dental surgery Scoleciphobia: Fear of worms Thanatophobia: Fear of death Source: Adapted from Townsend (2012). Essentials of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing, 7th ed. Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company, with permission.2993_Ch10_157-180 14/01/14 5:21 PM Page 163It is not uncommon for more than one phobia to develop in a person. They most often begin in childhood, perhaps repeated into a traumatic event. Phobias have three subcategories: agora- phobia, social phobia, and specic phobias. Agoraphobia is the irrational fear of being in open spaces and being unable to leave or being very embarrassed if leaving is required. EXAMPLE Agoraphobia: People who fear shopping in large malls or who fear going to sporting events may actually fear the possibility of being unable to escape in the event of an accident.Social phobias are those in which people avoid social situations as a result of fear of humiliation or being judged negatively. This reaction is out of proportion to the situation. There are correlations between people with this type of phobia and self-medicating with alcohol and/or drugs. EXAMPLE Social phobias: The fear of speaking in pub- lic and the fear of using public facili- ties such as bathrooms or laundromats are examples of social phobias. Specic phobias include having an irra- tional fear of a specic object or situation. These are the classic phobias that most people are familiar with. EXAMPLE Specic phobias: Claustrophobia (fear of enclosed places), hematophobia (fear of blood), and acrophobia (fear of heights).164 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Figure 10-3 A, Fear of snakes (ophidiophobia), and B, fear of spiders (arachnophobia), are two of the most common phobias.

A BTool Box |For a comprehensive list of phobias go to http://phobialist.com/# A- Clinical Activity When your hospitalized patient has a phobia such as agoraphobia, anticipation of the patient's reaction to leaving his/her room for testing must be addressed with the patient to prevent distress. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is reoccurring thoughts, ideas, and actions that interfere with a person's daily ability to function. DSM-5 no longer categorizes OCD as an anxiety disorder but puts it in its own category. This disorder is now be- lieved to be a neurological short circuit that causes repetitive behaviors. A genetic link among families who display OCD has also been suggested. OCD is different than obsessive compulsive personality disorder. See Chapter 14.2993_Ch10_157-180 14/01/14 5:21 PM Page 164OCD has two components: the obses- sion (repetitive thought, urge, or emotion) and the compulsion (repetitive act that may appear purposeful). It is not uncom- mon for people to be double and triple checking that doors are locked before one is able to sleep or leave the house. When these obsessive thoughts and compulsive actions begin to prevent a person from sleeping or leaving the house, it becomes OCD. The person with this kind of disor- der is unable to stop the thought or the action. Behaviors become very ritualistic (Fig. 10-4). Behaviors in patients with OCD vary. Some people wash their hands unceasingly. Others have a strict ritual that, if interrupted, requires starting over from the beginning. Some people have to check something or clean something over and over. People with this disorder tend to be perfectionistic and very rule-oriented. Physical symptoms also vary. If the person is prevented from performing the obsession or compulsion, the anxiety converts itself into somatic (body-related) symptoms. A related disorder to OCD is hoarding dis- order. This is a new disorder in DSM-5. Hoarding disorder is severe distress caused by persistent diculties discarding or parting with possessions.Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is developed in response to an unexpected emotional or physical trauma that could not be controlled. A victim of PTSD will prob- ably have reoccurring, intrusive, disturbing memories of the incident that may last over a period of time. This disorder was once viewed as an anxiety problem in DSM-IV-TR, but the current view is that it belongs in a new category\u2014T rauma and Stress or Related Disorders (DSM-5, 2013). So now it is viewed less as an anxiety problem and more related to the physical and emotional re- sponses to a trauma. One reason for this change is the increasing recognition that people suffering from PTSD often are more troubled with pervasive sadness, aggressive behaviors, and dissociative symptoms such as flashbacks than anxiety symptoms. Young children can also suffer from PTSD. People who have fought in wars, who have been raped, or who have survived violentCHAPTER 10|Anxiety, Anxiety-Related, and Somatic Symptom Disorders 165 Figure 10-4 Compulsive behaviors include refusing to step on a crack in the sidewalk. The behavior is very ritualistic, and perform- ing the action reduces the person's anxiety. (Courtesy of the National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD.)Critical Thinking Question Tommy has come to your clinic with numerous cracks on his hands, which are bleeding and very sore. Tommy tells you that he just has to wash his hands all the time. His mother says he will wash for 2 to 3 hours at a time, and he will not stop when she tells him to. The physician has diag- nosed Tommy with OCD and has explained the illness to Tommy and his mother. When the physi- cian leaves the room, Tommy's mother begins to cry: \"What did he just say? What am I supposed to do? What did I do wrong that Tommy got this illness?\" What will you tell her? What areas will you explore with her? Classroom Activity See the movie As Good as It Gets for a depiction of OCD. Clinical Activity When caring for a patient with OCD, identify what the sta has been doing to accommodate the patient's obsessions and compulsions.2993_Ch10_157-180 14/01/14 5:21 PM Page 165storms or other actual or threatened traumatic events are examples of those who are suscep- tible to suering from this disorder. Police, re, and rescue personnel are at risk for PTSD when they see victims of violence and de- struction whom they cannot help. The assault on the United States during the attacks on the World T rade Center towers, the Pentagon, and the passengers and crew on the ill-fated flight in Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001, has brought new attention to the con- dition of post-traumatic stress disorder. The horror of witnessing tragedy such as this now reaches anyone with a television or Internet; such a person can also suer from PTSD. People in countries far away are able to expe- rience tragedy in \"real time.\" Certainly those citizens who were on the scene and attempt- ing to save lives, saw destruction the likes of which most of us, hopefully, will never expe- rience directly. They and their families will deal with the post-traumatic eects of that day for some time to come. PTSD symptoms may appear immediately or be repressed until years later. Symptoms of PTSD can include: \"Flashbacks,\" in which the person may relive and act out the traumatic event Social withdrawal Nightmares Insomnia Feelings of low self-esteem as a result of the event Changes in the relationship with a signi- cant other and diculty forming new relationships Irritability and outbursts of anger toward another person or situation, apparently for no obvious reason Depression Distress when thinking about the event Making eorts to avoid reminders of the event Self-medicating with alcohol and other substances to treat the discomfort is a concern with many patients. The evaluation process should include a substance abuse assessment and treatment if needed. T rust and communication and listening skills are very important tools for nurses who have patients with PTSD. Encouraging ex- pression of thoughts and feelings surrounding the experience and the survivor guilt is an im- portant rst step in the patient's ability to identify the source of the problem and begin the process of healing (Fig. 10-5). It is impor- tant to validate the patient's feelings regarding the situation. Honesty and genuineness in communicating with these patients will help to build a working rapport. Family members and signicant others such as spouses can suer from the eects of PTSD as well. Often, these people experience the same trauma, even though they were not present for the original event. The term \"vic- arious trauma\" may apply in this situation.166 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Critical Thinking Question Think for a moment where you and your family members were on September 11, 2001. Think about the things you felt and shared with each other at that time. Do you feel as though you might have experienced a mild, moderate, or severe PTSD from 911? Magnify that as you think, \"what if I were the one standing on that sidewalk watching people die or jump from those buildings, wanting to help and knowing I couldn't?\" Dramatic? Maybe. Realis- tic? Yes. And just a very slight taste of the intensity of the fears and flashbacks people with PTSD experience. A term associated with PTSD is \"survivor guilt.\" This is the feeling of guilt expressed by survivors of a traumatic event. A Vietnam vet- eran may say, \"Why me? Why did that lady and her kids get blown away and I lived? They didn't deserve that.\" Another concern associ- ated with PTSD is the suicide rate among military who served in the wars. Since the Afghanistan war began, there has been a rise in suicide among military, suggesting that PTSD is a factor. This population continues to be in need for more mental health services (Drummond, 2012). Classroom Activity Watch the movies \"Coming Home\" and \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" to get a perspective of the return to civilian life after war.

Psychotherapy includes individual treatment, group therapy, and systematic desensitizationCHAPTER 10|Anxiety, Anxiety-Related, and Somatic Symptom Disorders 167 Critical Thinking Question Jeanne is a 21-year-old single woman admitted for pneumonia. Her social history indicates that she survived a house fire when she was 10 years old and that her twin sister died in that fire. Today is the day for the monthly fire drill at the hospital. You note that Jeanne is not in her bed. You are unable to find her during the drill. After the drill, you search her room and find her sit- ting on the floor of the closet. She is wrapped in a blanket and is crying. She does not respond to your verbal cues. What do you think is happen- ing to her? What illness might she have? How will you get her out of the closet? What can you do to help her? Figure 10-5 Encouraging the patient's expres- sion of thoughts and feelings about the traumatic experience, as in this painting, is an important first step in identifying the problem and beginning the healing process. (Courtesy of the National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD.) Pharmacology Corner Medications are being used eectively to control chronic anxiety. The most common are anti-anxiety medications, which include benzodiazepines. See Table 10-2 for a list of common anti-anxiety medications. The benzodiazepines are commonly used and are eective in most cases. Use of the anti- anxiety drugs is short-term whenever possi- ble because of the strong potential for dependency. Individuals with anxiety disor- ders who are chemically dependent are man- aged with other medications having calming qualities but not the same high potential for addiction as the anti-anxiety drugs. Hydrox- yzine hydrochloride (Atarax) and clonidine (Catapres) class of selective sero- tonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is being used as primary treatment in many cases of GAD, panic disorders, social phobias, OCD, and PTSD. For example, the FDA has approved fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvox- amine for treatment of OCD. Sometimes higher doses of the drugs than are used with depression are needed, so close monitoring of side eects is important. For PTSD, paroxe- tine and sertraline have been approved by the FDA. Panic disorders have been successfully treated with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and ser- traline. Dosing increases must be done slowly as these patients are especially sensitive to overstimulation from these medications. More research in under way to identify more eective medications for these conditions. 2993_Ch10_157-180 14/01/14 5:21 PM Page 167techniques to help the patient experience the anxiety-producing situation in a controlled environment and integrate the painful feelings associated with the anxiety. Patients concentrate on esteem needs and reality. Alternative Interventions for People With Anxiety and Anxiety-Related Disorders Aromatherapy Essential oils, such as peppermint or eucalyp- tus, are popular aids in relaxation. Methods of application include using diusers (machines that turn the oil into droplets that diuse into the air), placing a drop on a piece of clothing, or applying directly to the skin, such as the temple area. Patients can purchase these essen- tial oils and equipment at specialty stores, some bath oil supply stores, or even in some pharmacies. There are online resources as well. Prescriptions are not needed, but patients should be cautioned to use essential oils in very small amounts (drops at a time) and that some in dividuals may experience allergic responses, especially if the oils are applied directly to the skin. Biofeedback Biofeedback is a form of behavior modica- tion. It is a system of progressive relaxation. There are many tapes and products on the market to assist patients in this \"do-it-yourself\"method of relaxation. Biofeedback done eectively alters the brain to a slower wave frequency and can actually increase the im- mune response for humans. The patient should discuss with the doctor if biofeedback is appropriate. The nurse may assist with pro- viding information and resources. Hypnotherapy Hypnosis, done by a qualied, licensed ther- apist, may be helpful. It will assist the patient in relaxation. Some people joke about \"going to my happy place,\" but there is validity in nding pleasure or a lighthearted memory. Patients need to continue to take time to do the relaxation as directed by the therapist. Hypnosis is not a \"one-time\" therapy. It, like biofeedback, needs to be done routinely to be eective. The nurse's role may be as simple as to remind the patient to nd quiet time for this, or if the patient is being seen as an out- patient, the nurse may ask the patient how frequently she or he has been able to do the self-hypnosis and what kind of results the patient has experienced thus far. Additional Alternative Interventions The following may provide additional relief: Stress and relaxation techniques Yoga Acupuncture Kava Nursing Care for People With Anxiety and Anxiety- Related Disorders Common nursing diagnoses for people with anxiety and anxiety-related disorders: Anxiety, coping, ineective Fear Thought process, disturbed Violence, risk for General Interventions 1.Maintain a calm milieu: Patients who have anxiety disorders need to have a calm and safe treatment area. Minimiz- ing the stimuli helps the patient to keep centered and focused.168 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Encour- age the patient to verbalize all thoughts and feelings. Honesty in dealing with patients helps them learn to trust others and increases their self-esteem. Patients will feel the value that nurses have in that relationship. Observe the patient's non- verbal communication. As previously stated, aect and body language often re- veal more about a patient's thoughts and feelings than the words that are spoken. 3.Observe for signs of suicidal thoughts: Pa- tients with anxiety disorders, especially those suering with PTSD, are at risk for suicide as a result of feelings of low self-esteem or decreased self-worth. Nurses must be alert to this possibility and should observe and confront the patient and document any suspicions or statements the patient expresses. 4.Document any changes in behavior: Any change, no matter how small, can be signicant to the patient's care. Positive or negative alterations in the way a patient responds to the nurse, to thetreatment plan, or to other people and situations should be documented. The data collected and documented will allow the nurse to provide accurate feedback. 5.Encourage activities: Activities that are enjoyable and nonstressful help the patient in several ways. Activities pro- vide a diversion, give the patient time to concentrate on something other than the anxiety-producing situation, and give an opportunity to provide positive feedback to the patient about the progress he or she is making. These activities should be purposeful, not just \"busy work.\" The patient should not be put in a situation of competition as a result of activities. Competition could increase the anxiety and be counterpro- ductive to treatment.

The new term so- matic symptom disorders (SSD) replaces the old term somatoform disorders in DSM-5. SSD is characterized by somatic symptoms that are either very distressing or result in signicant disruption of functioning, as well as excessive and disproportionate thoughts, feel- ings, and behaviors regarding those symptoms. To be diagnosed with SSD, the individual must be persistently symptomatic (typically at least for 6 months). It is a category of disorders in DSM-5 as well as a specic diagnosis. In the past the term somatoform disorders was more associated with physical symptoms with no organic cause. This still may be 2993_Ch10_157-180 14/01/14 5:21 PM Page 170CHAPTER 10|Anxiety, Anxiety-Related, and Somatic Symptom Disorders 171 Panic Disorder Generalized Anxiety Disorder Nsg.

Davis Company, with permission.)2993_Ch10_157-180 14/01/14 5:21 PM Page 171the case in SSD but is not required. A promi- nent feature is excessive focus on one's physical symptoms, that interferes with one's daily functioning. These symptoms may or may not be associated with an actual medical condition. For example, a patient with a small sore seeks multiple opinions out of fear of skin cancer. Despite negative biopsies, the patient keeps checking it, talking about it, and seeking other possible providers who might oer other tests despite great nancial burden. In SSD high levels of worry about one's health becomes the central focus in the person's life even to the point of becoming the person's identity. These patients are high users of the health-care sys- tem, often seeking out dierent specialists and testing. So nurses will encounter these patients more often in nonpsychiatric settings. There is a denite anxiety component to this disorder as the individual worries excessively. Although distress is normal with a new symptom, exag- gerated responses before a diagnosis would be a factor in considering SSD diagnosis. In the past the term hypochondriasis might be used to describe someone with SSD. A patient who focuses extensively on physical symptoms is sometimes referred as suering from somati- zation or somatizing. Etiology of Somatic Symptom Disorder Biologically, research has been conducted concerning the possibility of a genetic or biological predisposition to somatic dicul- ties. For example some individuals may have increased sensitivity to pain. Early childhood traumatic experiences are also associated with SSD. Psychological theories include physical symptoms rooted in unconscious mecha- nisms that develop to deny, repress, or displace anxiety.Differential Diagnosis People with somatic disorders present many challenges in obtaining an accurate diagnosis. Nurses must be alert to physical illness that may actually be causing the symptoms. Multiple sclerosis, for example, can present with many and varied symptoms that may be as yet undi- agnosed. Discuss with the patient's medical doctor all possibilities for physical illness rather than a somatoform disorder. These patients can end up being subjected to many tests, proce- dures, and even surgeries with no improvement in symptoms. It is important to avoid labeling a person with SSD just because a physical basis for symptoms cannot be found. Somatic Symptom Related Disorders In addition to SSD, several related disorders are covered in this text including conversion disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and factitious disorder. In DSM-IV-TR additional diagnoses included dysmorphophobia and somatoform pain disorder. Conversion Disorder Conversion reaction, as dened in the defense mechanisms (see Chapter 7), is converting anxiety into a physical symptom. Conversion disorder is the illness that emerges from over- use of this mechanism. In conversion disorder, there is a loss or decrease in physical function- ing that cannot be explained by any known medical disorder or pathophysiological mech- anism. Paralysis and blindness are two of the more common examples of this disorder. It is common for the dysfunction to somehow be deeply connected to denial and to a prior neg- atively perceived experience (e.g., someone who loses the sense of vision after watching a pornographic movie). Age of onset is usually adolescence and young adulthood, but it can occur later in life as well. Conversion disorder is also referred to as Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder. The rationale is that per- sons diagnosed with Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder will likely be seen by a neurologist. The symptoms, although not supportive of organic disease, are very real to the patient.172 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Cultural Considerations How an individual experiences a bodily sensation can be linked to one's cultural perspective. Some symptoms may be more or less acceptable to acknowledge in dif- ferent cultures.2993_Ch10_157-180 14/01/14 5:21 PM Page 172The nurse should not convey to a patient that he or she thinks the patient is \"faking\" the illness; it is real to the patient. The patient is truly experiencing the symptoms. Even though the patient is concerned enough about the symptoms to consult a physician, he or she may give the impression of really not caring about the problem. \"La belle in- dierence\" is the clinical term used to de- scribe this condition. The belief about this disorder is that the symptom, e.g., the paralysis or blindness, is al- lowing the patient to avoid a situation that is unacceptable to him or her. This unacceptable situation is the source of extreme anxiety, which is converted into the dysfunction. The dysfunction, then, is relieving the anxiety. This is called primary gain and is believed to be the function of the paralysis or blindness. Second- ary gain is the extra benets one may acquire as a result of staying ill. Secondary gain in- cludes extra emotional support such as sympa- thy and love or nancial benets. Much of this is occurring at the unconscious level. Malingering is a situation for achieving personal gain that diers from the others mentioned. Malingering is a conscious eort to avoid unpleasant situations. The patient \"fakes\" or pretends to have the symptoms.the symptoms of the illness, while the person with illness anxiety disorder is afraid he or she will get a serious disease. Factitious Disorder Falsication of medical or psychological signs and symptoms in oneself or others is called a factitious disorder. The diagnosis requires demonstrating that the individual is taking se- cretive actions to misrepresent, simulate or cause signs or symptoms of illness or injury in the absence of obvious external rewards. When the individual falsies information for another as in a child or pet, the diagnosis is factitious disorder imposed on another or by proxy. CHAPTER 10|Anxiety, Anxiety-Related, and Somatic Symptom Disorders 173 Critical Thinking Question Will the DSM-5 change reduce the social negativ- ity associated with the word hypochondriasis? Illness Anxiety Disorder In this disorder somatic symptoms are not present or if present, are only mild in intensity. The person's distress is not from the physical complaint itself but rather from his/her anxiety about the meaning, signicance, or cause of the complaint. Historically these patients are often referred to popularly as hypochondriacs. These people are sometimes referred to as \"pro- fessional patients.\" Hypochondriasis has been a recognized, ocial diagnosis according to DSM-IV-TR. In DSM-5 hypochondriasis was changed to Illness Anxiety Disorder. A major dierence between illness anxiety disorder and conversion disorder is that the person with conversion disorder focuses onCritical Thinking Question Penny is a 35-year-old married mother of three children, ages 2 years, 3 years, and 4 months. She works as a clerk in a large office. She has been visiting the clinic regularly since her last preg- nancy. She is experiencing severe, intermittent pain in her right arm and left foot. The pain does not interfere with her life as a wife and mother, and she is not able to detect any kind of pattern to the pain. She tells you that she is not espe- cially concerned about the pain. \"When it gets too bad for me, my husband cooks and cleans the kitchen.\" Penny says that she thinks the source of her pain is related to \"the day I banged my right hip real hard on the door of the copy machine.\" She also has begun expressing concern that things are going so well for her that she \"just has the feeling that something terrible is about to happen.\" What is your preliminary impression of Penny's illness? What other information might you want to obtain from Penny? Medical Treatment of Patients With Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders Patients with these disorders are usually admit- ted to a medical unit rather than a psychiatric unit. T reatment focuses on the symptoms, which more than likely are medical in nature. The patient does not generally display unusual or unmanageable behavior that indicates the need for mental health unit admission. T reatment is, of course, individualized for each patient. Once a somatic disorder is2993_Ch10_157-180 14/01/14 5:21 PM Page 173diagnosed, the ongoing involvement of a psychiatrist is helpful to give insight to managing this patient. Some approaches that may be used to treat these disorders in- clude individual and group psychotherapy, hypnosis and relaxation techniques. It is beneficial for the therapist to help the pa- tient express the underlying cause of the anxiety. Hypnosis can be very effective in making this determination. Behavior mod- ification can be effective if the patient is prone to secondary gains from the somatic symptoms. Methods of stress management are also taught as the person learns new ways to handle anxiety. Patients may resist accepting that their problem has a strong psychological or emotional component and therefore cannot understand how a para- lyzed limb or pain has anything to do with anxiety. People who have a somatic symp- tom disorder may feel insulted, become re- sistive to treatment, and search for other ways to explain the physical problem. Alternative Interventions for Patients With Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders Alternative treatment of choice is related to the particular condition or symptom set. Choices may include the following treatmentsin addition to biofeedback, hypnosis, relax- ation, and imagery. Massage Massage therapies are believed to not only re- lieve tensions and discomforts in the muscu- loskeletal system, but also may assist with blood and lymph flow. Massage may be eec- tive, especially with medication, to assist the patient to overcome physical symptoms. Caution should be used, however, not to actually emphasize the body complaint and reinforce the illness. Herbal/Nutritional Supplements It is possible that a patient is experiencing a nutritional deciency or possibly a condition such as arthritis along with the somatoform disorder. Herbs or supplements geared to the specic pain issue may help the patient to experience less pain, either physically or psychologically. Nursing Care of the Patient With Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders Common nursing diagnoses include the following: Anxiety Coping, ineective Sensory perception, disturbed Thought processes, disturbed174 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Pharmacology Corner Medications are used sparingly because these patients typically have a history of being overprescribed. When medications are ordered for a patient, the classications of choice are usually selective serotonin reup- take inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., fluoxetine); cyclics, drugs; or combinations of these medica- tions. At this time, if medications are con- sidered, SSRIs are greatly preferred over the other classes of antidepressants and probably should be rst-line agents. See Table 10-5 for medications commonly used to treat somatic symptom and related disorders. lTable 10-5 Commonly Used Medications for Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders Medications are ordered judiciously for these disorders. When a medication is used, it is generally an antidepressant or an anti- symptoms and nursing interventions for the somatic symptom disorders discussed previously. Figure 10-7 is a concept map of somatoform disorders. Communication Skills Honesty in dealing with the patient is very important. Gaining trust that will encourage the patient to verbalize thoughts and feelings about the physical and emotional aspects of this type of disorder is crucial. Do not dis- count the patient's disorder. An example of a way to be honest about the situation follows. EXAMPLE Nurse: \"Ms. P , your physician can nd no physical or life-threatening conditions at this time. We will continue to ob- serve and examine you. We will make every attempt to help you improve.\" In this way, the patient understands that nothing is showing up in the tests that have been made to this point. The person hearsthat nothing life-threatening is causing the symptoms. The nurse has said that the sta is attempting to help the patient but has stopped short of promising improvement or of \"curing\" the patient. Socialization and Group Activities Keeping the patient focused on other topics may help in the recovery. Nurses will involve the patient in the goal setting and interventions of the care plan. Aiding the patient in learning assertive communication skills can be helpful. Working with other health-care staff in occupational therapy, recreational therapy, and social activities can also act to divert the patient's focus from the dysfunction. Support It is important for the nurse caring for patients with somatoform disorders to remember to pay attention to the patient but not to CHAPTER 10|Anxiety, Anxiety-Related, and Somatic Symptom Disorders 175 lTable 10-6 Nursing Care for Patients With Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders Type Symptoms Nursing Interventions Somatic Symptom Disorder Conversion Disorder Illness Anxiety DisorderHigh level of anxiety about health Excessive time and energy devoted to symptoms May or may not have an or- ganic disorder Loss or decrease in physical functioning that seems to have a neurological connec- tion (paralysis, blindness) Indierence to the loss of function Primary and secondary gain \"Professional patient\" Intense fear of becoming seriously ill Preoccupation with the idea of being seriously ill and not being helped\u2014may be con- cerned about not being taken seriously or evaluated properlyListen to patient's concerns but then focus on other issues Promote trust Encourage patient to express self about other issues than the symptoms Use therapeutic communication skills.

Psychoanalytic theories propose that it is important to find the underlying cause of the anxiety. Biologi- cal theories postulate that the causes are not the primary concern, but rather the physical reasons may result in the anxiety. 2.Medications and therapies should be individualized for the patient. 3.T rust and communication techniques are important tools for the nurse caring for a patient with an anxiety disorder. Main- taining a calm milieu is also essential. 4.Somatic symptom disorder is character- ized by somatic symptoms that are either very distressing or result in signicant disruption of functioning, as well as ex- cessive and disproportionate thoughts, feelings, and behaviors regarding those symptoms. The symptoms may or may not have an organic cause. 5.T reatment and nursing care for patients with somatoform disorders may be dicult and long-term, as these are chronic disor- ders. Patients may use the defense mecha- nisms of denial and conversion reaction. 6.DSM-5 (2013) is the current major for psychiatry. CASE STUDY 1.How will you respond to the patient's request for medication? 2.What are your thoughts about the patient's expectation for receiving medications? How will you discuss that with him? 3.What alternatives (for example, dietary, herbal, etc.) can you discuss with him or ask the doctor to discuss with him?A patient comes for his scheduled appoint- ment with Dr. Sneeze. The patient is a well-known politician. He has been the subject of negative press in recent months. His main symptoms are general malaise, sneezing, chronic headache, and \"feeling like I have a constant cold.\" Dr. Sneeze or- ders blood work and a chest x-ray and does a complete physical exam of the patient. You have collected vital signs and the health history when you roomed the pa- tient. The patient does not have a young family at home but is on the road cam- paigning and meeting his constituents almost daily. He believes he has become infected with something serious, since his symptoms do not seem to subside. Dr. Sneeze delivers the news to the patient that he is \"healthy.\" His examination and lab work do not show any physical illness, and the doctor suggests perhaps the symptoms are \"most likely viral in nature and probably stress and anxiety related.\" Dr. Sneeze suggests the patient take over-the-counter medications for his symptoms and nd methods to reduce his stress. Dr. Sneeze leaves the room. The patient expresses his extreme disappointment at not being given \"something to take\" and asks you to explain to him how stress can give one a cold.reinforce the symptom. The nurse should al- ways make a thorough head-to-toe assessment. This shows the patient that the nurse is con- cerned for the patient's health but will not be focusing on the area of dysfunction or reinforcing the problem. Nurses should docu- ment all ndings in a matter-of-fact way. Patients need to know that they are being taken seriously, even though they may not agree with the medical ndings of their illness.2993_Ch10_157-180 14/01/14 5:21 PM Page 177REFERENCES American Psychiatric Association.

Periods of emo- tional highs and lows are normal. Depressive disorders are very dierent from a transient bout of the \"blues\" or depressed mood. Depression is a painful and debilitating illness that aects all areas of one's life. There are sev- eral types of depression that are collectively called depressive disorders . These can change or distort the way a person sees himself, his life, and those around him. People who suer from depression usually see everything with a more negative attitude. They cannot imagine that any problem or situation can be solved in a positive way. Depression can take a variety of forms and aect all age groups. Depressive disorders all have similar symptoms that vary by duration, timing and presumed etiology. It is more common in women, but men with depression may be underdiagnosed (Figure 11-1). See Box 11-1 for list of general facts about depressive disorders. Types of Depressive Disorders Major Depressive Disorder Major depressive disorder, or major depression, is characterized by a combination of symptoms that severely interfere with a person's ability to work, sleep, study, eat, and enjoy once- pleasurable activities. These symptoms must last at least 2 weeks and very often last much longer to receive this diagnosis. Major depres- sion is disabling and prevents a person from functioning normally. Some people may ex- perience only a single episode of depression within their lifetime, but more often a person has multiple episodes. Major depressive dis- order aects approximately 5% to 8% of the U.S. population age 18 and older annually. A person has a 16.6% chance of developing a major depressive disorder in one's lifetime (Kessler, 2005). 181CHAPTER11 Depressive Disorders Learning Objectives 1.Dene depressive disorders. 2.Identify three types of depressive disorders. 3.Describe common physical and behavioral symptoms of major depressive disorder. 4.Identify treatment modalities for depressive disorders. 5. Describe key nursing care interventions for depressive disorders.Key Terms Depression Dysthymic disorder Major depressive disorder Mood Cultural Considerations Depression crosses all cultures and socioeconomic groups. However, depres- sive disorders may be misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed in some cultures due to language barriers and lack of access to mental health services. This is particularly true in cultures that are more fearful of being \"labeled\" with a psychiatric diagno- sis. Some cultures may express depressive symptoms as physical symptoms, such as fatigue and headache, while others may be more prone to speak in psychological terms of sadness and guilt.2993_Ch11_181-192 14/01/14 5:22 PM Page 181Differentiating a grief response to a major life loss from major depressive disorder can be dicult as some of the symptoms, such as sadness, insomnia, and poor appetite, may resemble a depressive episode. See Table 11-1 for tips to dierentiate grief from depression.Major depressive disorder is characterized by a classic cluster of symptoms. Behavioral and physical symptoms include: Five or more of the following for at least a 2-week period that represent a change in functioning: Sad mood Sleep pattern disturbances Increased fatigue Increased agitation Feelings of guilt or worthlessness Weight loss or gain Decreased interest in pleasurable activi- ties (anhedonia) Decreased ability to think, remember, or concentrate Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide These symptoms are often the same behav- iors someone experiences in a low period of his or her life, but the duration and intensity are increased (Figures 11-2 and 11-3). 182 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Figure 11-1 Depression is less reported in the male population, but this may be caused by male tendency to mask emotional disorders with behaviors such as alcohol abuse. lBox 11-1 General Information About Depressive Disorders Common not only in the United States but also internationally. Most common reason for seeking out mental health professional. Nearly twice as many women as men are affected by a depressive disorder annually. However, men frequently suffer from depression that may be masked. The elderly are prone to depression often related to multiple losses and decline of health, among other variables. Depressive disorders are being diagnosed earlier in life than they were in previous generations, including in children and adolescents. Because symptoms can be hidden and vague, the primary physician is often the rst to identify depression. Symptoms often go unrecognized and can be a factor in poor work perform- ance, family conflict, and substance abuse. Once one is diagnosed with a depressive disorder, there is a high probability of recurrence. Source: Adapted from Kessler et al. (2005): \"Major Depressive Disorders Among Adults\u2014National Institute of Mental Health.\"Tool Box |Clinicians use a number of depression scales to follow the severity of the patient's symptoms over time. These include: 1.Beck Depression Scale, www.psy-world.com/online_ hamd.htm A period of depression following the death of a loved one is normal.

Figure 11-3 Insomnia is a common symptom of depression. The classic image of a depressed person does not t all patients. Some may have more of the physical signs, such as loss of appetite, insomnia, and early morning wakening, and not display the outward sadness that is usually associated with depression.Neeb's Tipdepressive disorder. It aects approximately 5% to 6% of the U.S. population age 18 and older at some point in their lifetimes (Kessler, 2005). It often begins in childhood, adoles- cence, or early adulthood. About 40% of adults with dysthymic disorder also meet criteria for major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. Dysthymic disorder is characterized by a depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, as indicated by either subjective account or observation by others, for at least 2 years and 1 year in children. These symptoms are less severe than those of major depressive disorder but have gone on for long periods. Symptoms often include: Poor appetite or overeating Insomnia or hypersomnia Low energy or fatigue Low self-esteem Poor concentration or diculty making decisions Feelings of hopelessness Dysthymic Disorder Dysthymic disorder is a less severe form of depression that is characterized by its chronic nature. It is sometimes called persistent Critical Thinking Question Describe the behaviors that would dierentiate dysthymic disorder from major depressive disorder. Postpartum Depression Postpartum \"blues\" is a common response a few days after giving birth and may be related to fatigue, hormone changes, and anxiety. It resolves in a short time with rest and support. Postpar- tum depression, also called postpartum onset de- pression, occurs up to 6 months after childbirth and is a much more serious condition. Postpar- tum onset depression is classied as a major de- pressive disorder with the same classic cluster of symptoms as above with the addition of lack of interest in the baby, which can progress to rejec- tion of the baby and lead to a psychotic state. A patient suering from this disorder needs inten- sive treatment with medications and psychother- apy. See Chapter 20 for more information. Major Depressive Disorder With Seasonal Pattern Previously called seasonal aective disorder (SAD), this is a depression associated with seasonal patterns. Symptoms generally are exacerbated during the winter months and2993_Ch11_181-192 14/01/14 5:22 PM Page 183and 11-3 for medical conditions associated with depression and medications that con- tribute to depression. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder This form of depressive disorder was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5th edition in 2013. The features include a con- sistent pattern of markedly depressed mood, excessive anxiety, and mood swings during the week prior to menses, which start to subside during the spring and summer. This type of depression is thought to be related to the hormone melatonin. During months of longer darkness, there is increased production of melatonin that seems to trigger depressive symptoms in some people. Substance-Induced Depressive Disorder Substance-induced depressive disorder is de- pressed mood from the physiological eects of withdrawal, intoxication, or after exposure to a substance. This can include drugs of abuse such as alcohol, opioids, sedatives, and anti-anxiety medications as well as exposure to toxins. Depressive Disorder Associated With Another Medical Condition This condition is characterized by a prominent and persistent depression that is judged to be the result of direct physiological eects of a general medical condition.

Etiology of Depressive Disorders Depressive disorders are complex and may have multiple etiologies. Biochemical theories have become more important with the identi- cation of insuciency of neurotransmitters, especially norepinephrine and serotonin. These insuciencies may be the result of inherited or environmental factors. The eectiveness of an- tidepressants seems to result from enhancingCHAPTER 11|Depressive Disorders 185 lBox 11-2 Medical Conditions Associated With Depression Stroke (especially frontal lesions) Myocardial infarction Adrenal disorders Dementia Diabetes Cancer Hypothyroidism Brain tumors Parkinson's disease Multiple sclerosis Chronic pain Chronic kidney disease Source: From Gorman and Sultan (2008): Psychosocial Nursing for General Patient Care, 3rd ed.

Family history re- mains an important risk factor indicating ge- netic links. Psychological theories have focused on personal history of deprivation, trauma, and signicant loss. Classic psychoanalytic the- ory views depression as the reaction to the loss of a signicant person who has been both hated and loved. An individual can also be prone to low self-esteem and a sense of help- lessness due to environmental factors and have a tendency toward depression. Physical illness and medications are also frequent contributors to depressive symptoms. Treatment of Depressive Disorders T reatment involves a combination of pharma- cological and psychotherapeutic approaches. This approach has the best outcomes. The ad- vent of so many new antidepressants has pro- vided many more opportunities for successful treatment (see Pharmacology Corner). Indi- vidual psychotherapy to address past losses and stressors, short-term cognitive behavioral therapy to develop new strategies to alter neg- ative thinking, and group therapy to address socialization and poor self-esteem can all be helpful. For the patient with severe depression who does not respond to drugs or psychother- apeutic approaches, electroconvulsive therapy is sometimes suggested. It can be used in con- junction with other modalities such as med- ication. People may have a therapeutic session of 6-10 treatments over 4-8 weeks. Patients are given sedation prior to the treatment. The side eect of memory loss is frequently seen. Alternative Treatments Light Therapy Light therapy is being prescribed and used suc- cessfully in the treatment of depression with sea- sonal pattern. It consists of special lights to be Classroom Activity Arrange for a psychiatrist to talk to the class about psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in depressive disorders. Arrange for a hospital social worker to discuss depression with physical illness.2993_Ch11_181-192 14/01/14 5:22 PM Page 185used for certain amounts of time during the day. Also, exposure to natural light has been shown to reduce depression and increase alertness. Herbal and Nutritional Therapy General dietary changes such as avoiding caeine, sugar, and alcohol or adding servings of whole grains and vegetables may help a person with mild depression. Herbs such as St. John's wort, kava, gingko, sh oil, and SAMe have been shown to provide antidepressant eects in some patients with mild depression. St. John's wort probably should not be used with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or monoamine oxide inhibitors (MAOIs) (Skidmore-Roth, 2010). Nursing Care of the Patient With Depressive Disorders Common nursing diagnoses with this popu- lation include the following: Hopelessness Self-care decit Self-esteem, disturbed, decit Social interaction, impaired General Nursing Interventions Identify small, achievable goals the patient can meet. Provide support and encourage- ment. Break down tasks into small parts for the severely depressed patient. For example, rather than encouraging the patient to get dressed, have the patient focus on putting on a t-shirt. Encourage the patient to speak about his or her concerns without judgment. Use open-ended questions, such as \"Tell me what concerns you today.\" Avoid blanket reassurance like \"you are doing ne\" or minimizing the patient's feelings as in \"you're lucky you have a job.\" This might alienate a patient who is not feeling ne. Help a patient who verbalizes hopeless- ness to focus on describing his feelings and concerns. Then discuss one concern at a time to prevent it from being over- whelming for the patient. Encourage independence. Avoid activities that might tax memory or concentration if the patient is struggling with these. Monitor patient compliance with antide- pressants. Include education about potential side eects and not to expect results for several weeks. Encourage participation in activities to re- duce time spent ruminating on negative thoughts. Promote a trusting relationship.186 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Pharmacology Corner Antidepressants are the medications of choice in treating depressive disorders. See Table 11-2 for the categories of antidepres- sants. They are also used to treat depression associated with bipolar disorders, schizophre- nia, and dementia. Selected agents may be used to treat anxiety disorders and bulimia as well. Some of the target symptoms that anti- depressants may treat include sadness, inabil- ity to experience pleasure, change in appetite, insomnia, restlessness, poor concentration, and negative thoughts. These medications work to increase concentration of neurotrans- mitters such as serotonin and norepineph- rine. The side-eect proles. The anticholinergic actions of tricyclics and the rigid dietary restrictions needed for MAOIs often limit the use of these medications, but they can still be eective for some patients who are resistant to the other categories. These medications all require several weeks of use before some im- provement in depression can be expected; they should not be stopped abruptly. These medications are all oral preparations. Some- times combinations of antidepressants may be prescribed. See Chapter 8 for more infor- mation on these medications. When severely depressed patients are started on antidepressants, they need close monitoring. As the drugs take eect, the person's mood begins to lift and he or she may have the increased energy to imple- ment a suicide plan.2993_Ch11_181-192 14/01/14 5:22 PM Page 186Encourage the patient to challenge nega- tive thoughts. For example, identify an alternative solution to one problem, and encourage one example such as why the patient is a good parent. Promote physical activity where possible, for example, ambulating in the hall twice a day. Focusing on physical activity can promote the patient's sense of well-being. Promote the patient's self-esteem by identi- fying improvements or recent successes. The depressed patient may tend to focus only on negatives. If a patient gives any clues of contemplating suicide, notify other team members and thephysician immediately. See Chapter 13 for more interventions for suicidal patients. Table 11-3 provides the nursing care plan for depressed patients.CHAPTER 11|Depressive Disorders 187 lTable 11-2 Antidepressants monitoring. Symptoms include: dry mouth, urinary retention, con- stipation, blurred vision, sedation. Use with extreme caution in the elderly. SSRI withdrawal syndrome can occur with sudden discontinuation; includes dizziness, nausea, cholinergic rebound (salivation, loose stool) Monitor for insomnia, restlessness Monitor for dizziness, headache, tachycardia Serious, potentially fatal hypertensive crisis may occur in presence of foods high in tyramine (aged cheeses, red wine, smoked and processed meats). Special diet must be followed. Source: Adapted from Townsend (2012), Gorman & Sultan (2008), and Pederson & Leahy (2010). Depressive disorders can contribute to confusion and social withdrawal in the elderly and can lead to misdi- agnosis of dementia (sometimes called pseudodementia). These pa- tients need multidisciplinary assess- ment to obtain the correct diagnosis and treatment.Neeb's TipClinical Activity Review eective interventions used by the nurs- ing team to approach the depressed patient. Identify small goals that the depressed patient has achieved. As antidepressant drugs take eect, the patient may initially feel more energized before the mood lifts. A sui- cidal patient can be at increased risk during this period because he or she has more energy to initiate a suicide plan while still feeling hopeless. Any patient who is suicidal should be closely monitored during the rst few weeks on antidepressants. All antide- pressants carry a black box warning from the FDA about increased risk of suicidality in children and adolescents.Neeb's Tip2993_Ch11_181-192 14/01/14 5:22 PM Page 187188 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Clinical Activity Review the side-eect prole of your patient's antidepressants and incorporate teaching as appropriate to promote patient compliance. Critical Thinking Question A patient is complaining of nausea and dizziness. In reviewing the medications from home, the patient has been taking paroxetine for 5 years. The patient is now NPO due to surgery. What do you need to know about this medication that could be a factor in the patient's postoperative recovery? Critical Thinking Question Identify some of the proles from tricyclic antidepressants and from SSRIs. lTable 11-3 Nursing Care Plan for the Depressed Patient Data Nursing Collection Diagnosis Plan/Goal Interventions Evaluation Withdrawn, refusing to leave his roomImpaired social interactionTrack frequency of patient talking with others.

Over the past few months she has had increasing diculty in sleeping, poor concentration, and an over- whelming sense of sadness. Her mother died 1 year earlier, and Marge attributed these changes to a grief reaction. However, as time has gone on, the symptoms have become more distressing. She has stopped exercising, has turned down social invita- tions, and spends most of her time alone at home. She has begun missing work because of oversleeping, and her supervisor has approached her with concern. Marge has agreed to see her physician for a checkup. Marge presents to the doctor with a de- pressed appearance. On specic question- ing she reports feeling that she no longer feels competent in her job despite ad- vanced degrees and certication and over 20 years' experience. These feelings have increased over the past 3 months and occur daily. The physician considers major depres- sive disorder as a diagnosis and prescribes paroxetine.2993_Ch11_181-192 14/01/14 5:22 PM Page 189190 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Test Questions Multiple Choice Questions 1.Ms. S is admitted to your medical unit with a diagnosis of dehydration and a history of depression.

The common forms of bipolar disorders in- clude bipolar I, bipolar II, and cyclothymic, as well as several others. These are listed in Table 12-1. Bipolar disorders are often hard to diagnose until the behavior becomes exagger- ated, such as grandiosity, high-risk behaviors, violence. During hypomania phases (less severe hyperactivity), a person may be highly productive, so this disorder might not get diagnosed. Some highly creative people, such as Ernest Hemingway and Jackson Pollock, had this disorder. Cyclothymic disorder is a chronic disorder marked by multiple episodes of hypomania and depression. Mania episodes (also known as manic) are characterized by a distinct period of abnor- mality and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. Extreme mania can include psychotic behaviors such as hallucinations and delusions. There is a high risk of suicidewith bipolar disorder. Patients may also abuse alcohol or other substances in an eort to self-medicate to feel better. Bipolar disorder can be confused with depression, personality disorders, schizophrenia, substance abuse, and anxiety disorders. Clues that the illness is bipolar disorder include early onset, family history of bipolar disorder, recurrent depres- sions, repeated loss of ecacy of antidepres- sants, and hyperactivity during depressive episodes (Akiskai, 2009). See Box 12-1 for general information about bipolar disorders. Manic Phase The manic phase may last from days to months and cause marked disruption of occupational and social functioning. It can include the following symptoms: Easily distracted Little need for sleep (may feel rested after 3 hours of sleep) Poor temper control, easily agitated and irritable Reckless behavior and lack of self-control, including: Drinking, and/or drug use, binge eating Poor judgment2993_Ch12_193-204 14/01/14 5:24 PM Page 193194 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health lTable 12-1 Forms of Bipolar Disorders Type Description Bipolar I Bipolar II Cyclothymic Bipolar disorder due to another medical condition Substance/medication - induced bipolar disorderThe classic image of bipolar disorder\u2014a full syndrome of manic symptoms and most likely depression episodes At least one bout of major depression with episodic occurrence of hypomania.

Aects males and females at approximately the same rate. Episodes may or may not be associated with periods of depression It is usually initially diagnosed between ages 15 and 24. After the rst episode, there is a high risk of recurrence. Some have periodic episodes separated by years, and others have much more frequent cycles. There is strong evidence for a genetic/ inherited link, but a specic genetic defect has not yet been identied. Occurs in children but is dicult to diag- nose.

As a manic phase accelerates, this in- dividual can become frenzied and out of con- trol, leading to impaired decision making and even altered appearance. For example, females experiencing a manic episode may apply their make-up in a distorted manner, especially lip- stick. The person may be more reckless in other areas such as business decisions and potentially hazardous actions. The individual in a manic phase may be prone to abuse substances such as tranquilizers and/or alcohol to sleep and control some aspects of this behavior. Sub- stance abuse may also trigger bipolar disorders. The presence of substance abuse with bipolar disorder increases the negative outcomes and can confuse the illness presentation. Eating problems Loss of appetite and weight loss Overeating and weight gain Fatigue or lack of energy Feeling worthless, hopeless, or guilty Loss of pleasure in activities once enjoyed Loss of self-esteem Thoughts of death and suicide T rouble getting to sleep or sleeping too much Pulling away from friends or activities that were once enjoyed The conversion to manic phase from the depressed phase may appear quickly. Some- times the two phases of manic and depres- sion overlap. They may occur together or quickly one after the other in what is called a mixed state. Etiology of Bipolar Disorders Biological theories predominate as the cause of bipolar disorder. Studies indicate this disorder is caused by an imbalance in neurotransmit- ters, particularly norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. Increased levels are believed to be present in manic episodes and decreased in depressive ones. A genetic link has also been demonstrated through family studies. ACHAPTER 12|Bipolar Disorders 195 Patients in a manic phase can go for days without sleep and not feel tired. Neeb's Tip Depressed Phase The depressed phase of bipolar disorder is similar to those described for major depressive disorders in Chapter 11. The following symp- toms may be seen: Low mood or sadness Diculty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions Classroom Activity Watch lms depicting people with bipolar disor- der, including Pollack and Lust for Life. Cultural Considerations Bipolar disorder is more common in higher socioeconomic groups. As with other psychiatric disorders, mis- diagnosis can occur due to misunder- stood practices and language barriers. Bipolar disorder can be misdiagnosed as schizophrenia when culturally accepted behaviors are misunderstood.

Medical conditions and medications can trigger an episode in sus- ceptible people. See Box 12-2 for drugs and medical conditions that can precipitate a manic state. Treatment of Bipolar Disorders T reatment for bipolar disorder often starts emergently when family members realize the patient is in a mania state. People are more likely to seek treatment for themselves during depressive phases than during manic phases. When someone is in a state of euphoria, he or she is less prone to accepting treatment and less likely to think there is a need for it(Hirschfeld, 2008). Medications, the most common being mood stabilizers, are the pri- mary treatment. These can be used during an exacerbation as well as for control of fre- quency and intensity of future episodes (see the Pharmacology Corner). T reatment should include psychotherapy in combination with medications to reduce the severity of relapse and promote medica- tion compliance. Early diagnosis is also con- sistent with improved outcomes. Patients are sometimes resistant to taking these medica- tions when they have stabilized due to poten- tial side eects. Therefore, education on medication compliance is an essential part of the treatment plan. After a manic phase, psychotherapy and family therapy may help patients and families cope with the shame and long-term eects of the manic phase. During a manic phase, the patient may have hurt loved ones emotionally with words and ac- tions. As life becomes flatter and less exciting without mania, the patient may need support to cope with life with less highs and more stability. It is common for patients to use al- cohol and sedative drugs to try to sleep during manic episodes as well as stimulants during196 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Critical Thinking Question Your new patient on the substance abuse unit has a diagnosis of bipolar disorder I as well as alcohol use disorder.

Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company, with permission. Pharmacology Corner Mood stabilizers are the cornerstone treat- ment of bipolar disorders. See Table 12-2 for a listing of mood stabilizer medications. These include lithium and a number of anticonvulsants including carbamazepine, valproic acid, and lamotrigine. These medica- tions often are a lifelong regimen. People with bipolar disorder may also continue on antide- pressants and may require anti-anxiety and/or antipsychotic drugs such as olanzapine during the acute manic phase. The antipsychotic aripiprazole is also used to treat bipolar disorder. Many patients will continue on more than one medication to remain in remission. Patients must be counseled to re- port side eects rather than stop medications abruptly. If side eects are too distressing, alternative medication combinations can be prescribed. See Chapter 8 for additional information on mood stabilizers.2993_Ch12_193-204 14/01/14 5:24 PM Page 196depressive phases, so substance abuse coun- seling may be part of the treatment plan. T reatment should also include monitoring adequate fluid and food intake, as these can become compromised during all phases of this disorder. In the early phases of a manic episode, al- ternative treatment that includes herbs such as chamomile and valerian can help with mild anxiety and insomnia. Lithium requires close monitoring, including regular blood levels. Therapeutic levels are be- tween 0.5 and 1.2 mEq/L for most patients (1.0 and 1.5 in acute mania). There is a narrow range between therapeutic and toxic levels, so close monitoring is needed. The blood levels can be- come elevated in dehydration, profuse sweating, and chronic diarrhea leading to toxicity. ToxicityCHAPTER 12|Bipolar Disorders 197 lTable 12-2 Mood Stabilizers Drug Category Drug Examples Important Considerations Lithium Carbonate AnticonvulsantsToxic symptoms can occur even at normal blood levels, so monitoring of adverse eects must be ongoing.

May take several weeks Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing: Concepts of Care in Evidence-Based Practice, 7th ed. P hiladelphia: F.A. Davis Company, with permission. Lithium toxicity can develop quickly, especially in dehydration. Patient education must be an ongoing process so patients are reminded to monitor themselves.Neeb's Tip lTable 12-3 Signs of Lithium Toxicity Serum 1.5-2.0 vision, ataxia, tinnitus, ing, diarrhea 2.0-3.5 mEq/L Excessive output of dilute urine, increased tremors, muscle confusion Source: Adapted from Townsend (2012), Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing: Concepts of Care in Evidence-Based Practice, 7th ed. Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company, with permission.can cause tremors, confusion, seizures, coma, and even death. Early warning signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, and sedation. See Table 12-3 for signs of lithium toxicity. Lithium takes about 7-10 days to reach the desired eect and is only available orally. A variety of anticonvulsants are used as mood stabilizers. Regular CBCs to monitor for anemia and blood dyscrasias are an important part of the follow-up and patient teaching. Each anti- convulsant has a specic side-eect prole, so this should be incorporated in patient teaching. Compliance with medication regimen is an ongoing issue with bipolar patients. If Lithium has a FDA black box warning that toxicity can occur at doses close to therapeutic levels. It should be pre- scribed when there are resources to provide ongoing blood tests.Neeb's Tip2993_Ch12_193-204 14/01/14 5:24 PM Page 197they are in a euphoric state, they may believe they don't need medications. When they are in remission, they may be more concerned about side eects and stop their medications. Patient teaching and follow-up counseling continue as part of the nursing care of these patients. See Table 12-4 for the side eects of mood stabilizers. Nursing Care of the Patient With Bipolar Disorders Common nursing diagnoses for patients with bipolar disorder include the following: Anxiety Coping, ineective Nutrition, imbalanced: less than body requirements Self-care decit Sleep pattern, disturbed Thought process, disturbed General Nursing Interventions Provide clear, rm limits. Clearly dene what is expected and what is not allowed. For example, if the patient needs to pace, set a specic area where that can be done; if he is talking too loudly, point198 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health lTable 12-4 Side Effects of Mood Stabilizing Agents Side Effects Medication Nursing Implications Drowsiness, dizziness, Dry mouth GI upset Fine hand tremors Polyuria, dehydration Weight gain Increased suicide riskEducate patient on safety, driving.

Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company, with permission. Bipolar patients on medications should be counseled to use birth control as many of these medications are not safe to use in pregnancy. Patients need to be counseled to speak with their physicians about associated risks.Neeb's Tip Anticonvulsant drugs have an ad- verse eect of increased risk of suici- dality. Patients taking such drugs must be monitored closely for worsening depression and suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Neeb's Tip Cultural Consideration Ethnically diverse populations may metab- olize medications dierently.Critical Thinking Question A 29-year-old patient with a history of bipolar I disorder is NPO for surgery. He is routinely taking lithium and lamotrigine. Since he is unable to take these medications, what concerns would you have and what would you monitor?2993_Ch12_193-204 14/01/14 5:24 PM Page 198this out and encourage the need to lower his voice. Focus on reality, especially when the patient describes grandiose ideas. Present reality without arguing with patient. Remove hazardous objects from the patient's room. Promote safety for all involved in the patient's care by identify- ing signs of increasing potential for violence. Reduce external stimulation such as extra- neous noise. Provide an outlet for excess energy by letting the patient pace or exercise. Encourage activities that don't require a lot of concentration Encourage patient compliance with medication regimens and lab testing. Take the time to establish a relationship with the patient to promote a sense of safety. Identify ways to ensure the patient is eating and drinking adequately; for exam- ple, provide food that is easy to eat on the move. Encourage the patient to complete thoughts or actions rather than jumping from item to item. If the patient is depressed, see the nursing interventions in Chapter 11.Table 12-5 provides the nursing care plan for patients with bipolar disorders.CHAPTER 12|Bipolar Disorders 199 Patients can move quickly from social, affable, highly energetic, fun behavior to angry, violent behavior.Neeb's Tip Patients in a manic phase exhibit poor insight and judgment, so this provides a challenge to nurses to manage inappropriate behavior.Neeb's Tip Clinical Activity Monitor lithium levels. Review potential medication side eects that can contribute to the patient's symptoms as well as compliance with mood stabilizers.Critical Thinking Question A 45-year-old patient with a long history of bipo- lar II disorder has been in remission for 5 years. She tells you she has stopped taking her valproic acid because she feels so good and the medica- tion prevented her from losing weight. How should you respond? Clinical Activity Identify the family support network for the bipolar patient and ensure that they are knowledgeable on monitoring signs of manic episodes. Classroom Activity Review the drug categories for treatment of bipolar disorder and develop patient teaching materials for each. Key Concepts 1.Bipolar disorders can include severe de- pressions with periods of extreme mania, as well as severe depressions with minor bouts of mania. 2.The manic phase can last for days, weeks, or months and cause severe disruption in all areas of functioning. 3.Lithium remains a recognized treatment for bipolar disorder and requires moni- toring of blood levels to ensure safety. 4.A number of new medications to treat bipolar disorder are now used as well, including many anticonvulsants. 5.Ongoing medication management is challenging as the euphoric patient will often deny the need for these medications. 6.Primary nursing interventions for a patient in mania include maintenance of safety, promotion of health, and medication compliance.2993_Ch12_193-204 14/01/14 5:24 PM Page 199200 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health lTable 12-5 Nursing Care Plan for Patients With Bipolar Disorders Nursing Data Collection Diagnosis Plan/Goal Interventions Evaluation Inappropriate behavior including loud conversation, swearing, domineeringIneective copingPatient is able to control one behavior for a set period of time.Calmly point out to patient what behavior is not appropriate, e.g., \"you're talking too loud again.\" Avoid sounding angry or judgmental.

He recently joined a prestigious law rm and is anxious to make a strong impression with the partners. He has a long history of success in life, in- cluding graduating from a top law school with excellent scores, making a large in- come, and having many friends and associ- ates. He is gregarious and always seems to be the center of attention wherever he is. His new position is more stressful than his previous jobs were. He has been sleeping only 2 to 3 hours a night and then coming in to the oce at 4 a.m. to keep up with the workload. He drinks heavily at night to try to sleep and uses stimulants in the morning to keep going. He has received alot of attention in the oce for a recent successful litigation. However, his assistant notes he is increasingly irritable and de- manding, often changing from charming to angry at the slightest frustration. A woman in the oce reports him to the superiors for inappropriate sexual advances. When he is brought into the oce to discuss the allega- tions, he explodes and storms out of the oce. Later that night he is arrested in a bar for ghting with a patron and tells the police he is friends with the chief of police and will get the ocer red. Jonathan is brought to the ER by the police and acknowledges he had been diag- nosed with bipolar disorder in college but stopped taking his lithium a year ago. 2993_Ch12_193-204 14/01/14 5:24 PM Page 200REFERENCES Akiskai, H.S.

Many people experience momentary self-destructive thoughts during a bout of depression or a set- back in life, but they do not take action on these thoughts. Thinking about suicide does not mean the individual will act on those thoughts; however, anyone who talks about, threatens, or makes a suicide attempt must be taken seriously. Because suicide is viewed as un- acceptable in Western culture, it generates anx- iety that has led to a number of myths. See Table 13-1 for a list of common myths. Here are some important facts about sui- cide in the United States: Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 1% of all deaths. More people die from suicide than from homicide. More years of life are lost to suicide than to any other single cause except heart dis- ease and cancer. 37,000 Americans died by suicide in 2010, which included four times as many men as women; an additional 500,000 Americans attempt suicide annually. 205CHAPTER13 Suicide Learning Objectives 1.Identify main populations at risk for suicide. 2.Identify myths and truths about suicide. 3.Identify warning signs of suicide. 4.Identify nursing care for people who are suicidal. 5.Describe the management of a suicidal patient in the acute hospital.Key Terms Lethality Suicide Suicide attempt Suicide contract Suicide ideation Suicide pact Survivor of suicide Suicide crosses all cultural, age, gender, race, and socioeconomic groups. The actual ratio of attempts to completed suicides is probably at least 10 to 1. A high percentage of people who complete suicide have made a previous attempt. The risk of completed suicide is more than 100 times greater than average in the rst year after an attempt\u201480 times greater for women, 200 times greater for men, 200 times greater for people over 45, and 300 times greater for white men over 65. Suicide rates are highest in the age group of 45-54 years, with the over-85 group close behind (Fig. 13-1). Veterans returning from war have a higher rate of suicide than civilians. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults. Suicide pacts or copycat suicides among some adolescent groups have been seen in some communities. Single auto crashes are generally investi- gated as possible suicides. 8.3% of adults have serious thoughts of suicide during any year. The most common methods of suicide include rearms, hanging, and overdose. The lethality of suicide methods is a factor in the assessment of the patient. Men more commonly use the highly lethal methods of2993_Ch13_205-216 14/01/14 5:24 PM Page 205rearms and hanging, accounting for their higher death rate. Those who overdose have a greater chance of surviving because they receive treatment if found in time.206 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health lTable 13-1 Clearing Up the Myths About Suicide Myth Truth Asking people about their suicidal thoughts will make them more likely to act on them. All people who attempt suicide have a psychiatric disorder. A person who talks about suicide will not do it. A person who attempts suicide will not try again. People who attempt suicide are always determined to die. People who attempt suicide just want attention. As the person becomes less depressed, the risk of suicide decreases. Source: From Gorman and Sultan (2008). Psychosocial Nursing for General Patient Care, 3rd ed. Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company, with permission.Most people are not afraid to talk about their thoughts of committing suicide and are usually grateful that someone is available and cares. Talking can reduce the sense of isolation. People can become overwhelmed with life circumstances without having a psychiatric disorder. Approximately 80% of individuals who attempt or complete suicide give some denite verbal or indirect clues. As many as 50% have seen their physician within the previous month, often with vague somatic complaints. Almost 75% of those individuals who complete suicide have attempted it at least once before. Many individuals are ambivalent and are using the suicide as a cry for help. Even if the suicide attempt is manipulative, the individual may go on to complete the suicide. As the depression begins to lift, the individual's energy level can increase before feelings of hopelessness are relieved. Once the individual makes the decision that suicide is an eective solution to the problems, his or her mood may even elevate. Figure 13-1 Older adults often have diculty coping with loss, loneliness, and depression, and they have very high rates of suicide. Classroom Activity Discuss factors that contribute to suicide in today's society. Discuss the impact on yourself of suicide of well-known people.For every person who commits suicide, six persons on average are left behind as survivors of suicide.

Suicide remains a major public health problem, and all nurses must be familiar with risk factors, warning signs, and interventions to provide support to individuals at risk. Suicide can be a long-planned action or an im- pulsive act when the person is overwhelmed . People with a variety of psychiatric disorders, including depression, bipolar disorder , anxiety2993_Ch13_205-216 14/01/14 5:24 PM Page 206disorders, personality disorders, and sub- stance abuse, may consider suicide. Drugs or alcohol can contribute to accidental overdoses when the individual's judgment is impaired or be part of the self-destructive cycle. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) has created a new cate- gory, named Suicidal Behavior Disorder, for an individual who has initiated a behavior with the expectation that it would lead to the individual's own death within the last 24 months. Psychotic individuals can also ex- perience hallucinations in which they believe they are being told to kill themselves by voices or powers outside of themselves. Being alert to signals that the patient is at risk for suicide re- quires good observation skills and communi- cation with the patient and health-care team.hopelessness, shame, and guilt; and humili- ation, have been linked to suicidal ideation. Suicide may be viewed by some as a relief from overwhelming suffering (physical or emotional); some see it as a way to reunite with a loved one who has died. A psychotic individual may view suicide as a way to stop hallucinations, or the hallucinations may be telling the patient to commit suicide. See Box 13-1 for a list of common risk fac- tors for suicide. Suicide crosses all age groups. See Chapter 19 for more information on suicidal behavior in children and adolescents. Older adults, espe- cially those facing health issues and multiple losses, may be at risk for suicide. It is common for suicidal older adults to have seen a health- care provider in the prior year, so identifying any risk factors in elderly patients is an important part of the care plan. White elderly men are known to have one of the highest suicide rates. The Warning Signs of Suicide One of these signs does not necessarily mean the person is considering suicide, but several of them may signal a call for help. Eight out of 10 people considering suicide give someCHAPTER 13|Suicide 207 Cultural Considerations White males constitute the largest group of suicides. Native American males are also at high risk. African American females tend to have a lower rate (Goldston, 2008). Some groups are less prone to suicide based on religion; for example, Roman Catholics. Some cultures, however, are more tolerant than others of suicide. Critical Thinking Question Your teenager tells you a friend swore her to secrecy that she was going to kill herself because her boyfriend rejected her. Your teen asks you not to tell anyone. What action should you take? Etiology of Suicide Research shows that the risk for suicide is as- sociated with changes in brain chemicals called neurotransmitters, including serotonin. Decreased levels of serotonin have been found in people with depression, impulsive disor- ders, a history of suicide attempts, and suicide victims (National Institute of Mental Health Statistics on Suicide, 2012). Psychological factors, such as anger turned on oneself; an overwhelming sense ofSource: From U.S. Public Health Service (1999) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2010). lBox 13-1 Risk Factors for Suicide Risk factors for suicide include the following: More than 90% of people who die by suicide have a mood disorder and/or a substance abuse disorder. Mood disorder can include depression or bipolar disorder. Suicide risk can increase at the beginning of treatment with antidepressants as the return of energy brings increased ability to act out self-destructive thoughts. Alcohol is involved in many suicides. Prior suicide attempt Family history of mental disorder, sub- stance abuse, family violence, sexual abuse, or suicide Exposure to the suicidal behavior of others, such as family members, peers, or media gures Poor support system Grief from recent loss Untreated symptoms in terminal illness2993_Ch13_205-216 14/01/14 5:24 PM Page 207sign of their intentions, so these warning signs can save lives if recognized in time. People who talk about suicide, threaten suicide, or call suicide crisis centers are 30 times more likely to kill themselves. Suicidal people often reach out for help and generally retain some ambivalence or contradictory feelings experi- enced simultaneously. Consequently, getting help to someone who is considering suicide can save a life. Most people who consider suicide have some level of ambivalence. The suicide warning signs from the National Center for Health Statistics on Suicide include the following: Verbal suicide threats, such as \"You'd be better o without me,\" \"Maybe I won't be around,\" or \"I won't be here when you come back to work\" Expressions of hopelessness and helpless- ness and the inability to see alternatives Previous suicide attempts Talking about suicide methods to which the person has access Saving pills Asking questions/researching about dier- ent methods of committing suicide Daring or risk-taking behavior Personality changes Depression Lack of interest in future plans (National Center for Health Statistics Suicide and Self-Inflicted Injury, 2012) Other warning signs may include the following: 1.Noticeable improvement in mood occurs: When this happens in a suicidal person, it is often a sign that the person has made the decision that has been causing per- sonal conflict. The pain that is being expe- rienced will soon be over for that person. The feelings of those who will be left be- hind may or may not be a consideration. It has been said that suicide is the ultimate controller. For some people, this may be the only situation they have felt they could control in their lives. Some people are not concerned about the survivors because their own pain overrides that of others. Some people, especially younger ones, may view death in a more romanticizedway. Television, movies, and computer games that show death often do so in a way that is glamorous or humorous. Young people may not make the connec- tion between the fantasy of the media and the reality of life, or they become so caught up in seeking revenge or making others suer that they do not consider the nality of what they are attempting. 2.Person starts giving away personal items: When someone has made the decision to terminate his or her own life, it becomes no longer necessary to keep certain things. Some people will even attempt to give away a beloved pet. However, these indi- viduals do want those items cared for. In an attempt to \"tie up loose ends,\" they decide who will get certain items. The items will be given away for reasons other than \"because I am going to kill myself,\" although people sometimes use that hon- est approach and are not taken seriously. Usually, these people will simply say that it is time to clean out a certain room or that they no longer need a certain item and they would like it to go to a special friend. Individuals may also write or change a will when contemplating suicide. 3.Person starts talking about death and sui- cide or becomes preoccupied with learning about these things: Curiosity about death is not unusual. People tend to be curious about what they do not know. When this curiosity becomes a preoccupation and a single thought for the patient, it signals that the patient has ideas of attempting suicide. Reporting this to the charge nurse and documenting the concerns are required.208 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Classroom Activity Movies with suicide themes include The Hours and Whose Life Is It Anyway? Treatment of Individuals at Risk for Suicide Suicide is a major public health concern. Pre- vention is focused on identifying people who display the warning signs and risk factors, and2993_Ch13_205-216 14/01/14 5:24 PM Page 208providing them with support and interven- tions. Anyone who talks about suicide must be taken seriously and interventions insti- tuted immediately to address her or his con- cerns and problems. Individual and group psychotherapy; emergency psychiatric care such as hotlines and on-call mental health professionals; pharmacological treatment for depression, psychosis, and anxiety; and inpa- tient hospitalization if the person is at high risk for suicide are some of the approaches. Patients who make multiple suicide attempts need ongoing psychotherapy to address their issues and impulses. Patients at low to mod- erate risk for suicide can be followed as out- patients with adequate support built in the treatment plan, such as family and friends, suicide contracts, medications, and regular mental health appointments. Family and friends of anyone who com- mits suicide need special support. These indi- viduals are referred to as survivors of suicide and are at risk for long-term emotional dis- tress, especially related to guilt and anger and their elusive search for \"why?\" The stigma of suicide adds to the complexity of a lifetime of trying to recover. Support groups are available in many communities for survivors of suicide. Anxiety Coping, ineective Self-concept, disturbed Spiritual distress Thought processes, altered Nursing responsibilities for patients who are suicidal are many. The goal, of course, is always to prevent the suicide. Because the nurse may not know when suicide potential exists, especially for a rst attempt, using ex- cellent observational skills and communication skills is mandatory. Nurses are bound (underCHAPTER 13|Suicide 209 Tool Box | Suicidology.org has many resources for suicidal patients, their families, and profes- sionals, including support programs for survivors: www.suicidology.org/suicide-survivors National Suicide Prevention Lifeline oers a 24/7 free condential, nationwide net- work of crisis centers: 1-800-273-TALK (8255) mandated suicide pre- vention hotline number: 1-888-SUICIDE (1-888-784-2433) Nursing Care of the Suicidal Patient Common nursing diagnoses in those at risk for suicide include the following: Hopelessness Violence to self, risk for Pharmacology Corner Suicidal patients may benet from taking anti-anxiety medication, such as lorazepam, to reduce feelings of intense anxiety or dis- tress. In addition, antipsychotic and anti- manic medications may be prescribed as needed for patients with bipolar or psy- chotic disorders. If antidepressants are being started, it is important to remember that it will take a number of weeks to lift depres- sion, so other interventions must be used in the interim to prevent suicide. Antidepres- sants could actually increase suicide risk if the patient gets a sudden burst of energy to act out the plan before the depression lifts. However, untreated depression puts the pa- tient at greater risk, so antidepressants are generally seen as protection against suicide. Patients at high risk for suicide may need to have medications administered in liquid or parenteral form to avoid \"cheeking\" and hoarding pills that could be collected to use for an overdose. Outpatients should be given only a few days' supply of any med- ication that could potentially be used in a suicide attempt. Overdosing on antidepres- sants is a highly lethal method of suicide, so caution must be taken with how these are dispensed for someone at high risk. Adequate symptom management for pain and other distressing symptoms must be provided to the patient with a serious or terminal illness. A patient's belief that his or her symptoms cannot be controlled could be a contributing factor in hopelessness and suicide.2993_Ch13_205-216 14/01/14 5:24 PM Page 209the Meier v. Ross General Hospital case) to report any reasons they have to suspect the patient may be suicidal. Nurses must report their observations to their team and document actions in the health-care record. A nurse should never take the responsibility of helping a suicidal person on his or her own. Once a nurse suspects suicidal ideation, informing all members of the health-care team is essential so appropriate treatment and patient safety can be ensured. If a patient is considered suicidal, the following interventions can be helpful. General Nursing Interventions 1.Monitoring frequently: Check on the suici- dal patient frequently but avoid a pre- dictable routine and ensure that the patient is checked during extra-busy times like shift change. If the patient is actively suicidal, a psychiatric consultation will be required and the patient may be placed on 1:1 precautions until the patient can be moved to an appropriate treatment set- ting. On 1:1 precautions the nurse will be required to accompany and remain with the patient in the bathroom. Nurses must follow their agency policies on providing safety for the suicidal patient. 2.Safety: Keep any potentially harmful items away from the patient, such as knives, scissors, glass, razor blades, belts, nail les, electrical cords, and even linens. Inform visitors of this so they do not bring items patient may request. Ensure that windows cannot be opened. The room may need to be searched periodically, and the patient may need a body search and close moni- toring in the bathroom. It is common for patients who are at very high risk for sui- cide to wear paper gowns and to have paper bedding. Large objects that can be used to break a window also need to be removed. Plastic trash bags should not be used in the patient's room.3.Communication: Ask outright if the patient is considering suicide and, if so, how and when. Asking a patient to talk about suici- dal thoughts does not enhance the chance of completing a suicide. Rather, it demon- strates caring and acknowledges his or her value as a person. Ask if the patient has at- tempted suicide in the past. In addition, be prepared to talk to the patient about his or her feelings, work to reframe hopelessness, and assist in problem solving to identify alternative solutions to problems the patient views as insurmountable. When talking to someone who is suicidal, avoid platitudes like \"think what this would do to your children.\" Often the suicidal person is so immersed in feelings of hopelessness and isolation that he is unable to identify with how others are feelings. In addition, the pa- tient may view that the family will be better o without him. When working on prob- lem solving, break down one problem into manageable steps rather than looking at the whole picture, which can be overwhelming. Most people who are suicidal have ambiva- lent or mixed feelings about taking action. Supporting the reasons the person does not want to commit suicide can help the per- son to reevaluate the situation.210 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Tool Box |American Association of Suicidol- ogy Guidelines for Inpatient and Residential Patients Known to Be at Elevated Risk for Suicide at: If your patient has been identied as suicidal, review the care plan for all the safety measures in place for this patient. Review policies from assigned hospitals on how to manage suicidal patients. If you suspect someone is suicidal, be direct in asking about his or her plans. Suicide is an emotional subject and great care must be taken with any- one who expresses suicidal ideation. Report any suicidal ideation or be- havior immediately. The hopelessness experienced by a suicidal patient can be draining and overwhelming for the nurse. Recognize that team members need extra support when working with anyone who is suicidal.Neeb's Tip2993_Ch13_205-216 14/01/14 5:24 PM Page 2104.Contract: The treating team may want to consider making a suicide contract with the patient. This is a written agreement between the patient and the treating team where the patient agrees to inform the team before taking any action to harm him- or herself. See the Toolbox to access a sample contract. A contract is helpful for some patients who are waver- ing on what to do. Table 13-2 provides the nursing care plan for suicidal patients.CHAPTER 13|Suicide 211 Clinical Activity If your patient has a history of suicide attempts, discuss any concerns with your instructor. Tool Box |Example of suicide contract at www.suicide.org/no-suicide-contracts.html 5.Discharge planning: Any patient with suicidal ideation needs close follow-up at time of discharge from the hospital. Mental health follow-up, hotline numbers, involving family/friends in the discharge plan, and ensuring that discharge prescrip- tions are dispensed in small amounts are some things to be incorporated in the plan. (Guptill, 2011; Puskar & Urda, 2011; Rittenmeyer, Box 13-2 for suggestions on talk- ing with a suicidal patient to evaluate lethality.Critical Thinking Question Your 85-year-old patient is a recent widower. He is in the hospital for recovery from a recent fall. He tells you he wants to go home so he can be with his wife. How would you respond to that statement? Critical Thinking Question Your patient with multiple chronic health prob- lems has been diagnosed by the psychiatrist as actively suicidal. She is too ill to be transferred to the psychiatric unit. Describe what actions the team should take to prevent a suicide attempt on your medical surgical unit. Classroom Activity Obtain information about local suicide prevention programs such as counseling centers and hotlines. Patients who are terminally ill may ver- balize vague suicidal thoughts such as \"I would kill myself if my pain gets too bad.\" Encourage your patient to talk about fears and discomforts. Patients with good symptom management are much less likely to think about suicide.Neeb's Tip Clinical Activity When administering medications to suicidal patients, consider having a colleague with you to double-check that the patient has swallowed the pills. lBox 13-2 Talking With a Suicidal Patient to Evaluate Lethality 1.Do you think about hurting or killing yourself? If yesfl 2.Do you have a plan? How have you considered doing it? If yes fl 3.Do you think you may or will do something to act on your thoughts? If yes, where and when? Do you feel you have control over your own behavior? 4.Do you have the means available (such as rope, rolled-up sheet, gun, saved-up pills [note lethality of plan])? 5.Have you ever tried to harm yourself in the past? If yes, how? Did you expect to survive? 6.Are you willing to contract or notify sta whenever you feel you may act on these thoughts? Our side of the contract is to be available and actively help you during these times. If the patient denies having a suicide plan, ask about other plans for the future and support systems. 1.What do you see yourself doing in a week, in a month, and in a year from now? 2.Do you feel optimistic or pessimistic about the future? 3.Do you have family members or friends with whom you can freely discuss your problems?

One friend calls Je's ex-wife to tell her that Je called him and was quite emotional, say- ing he feels guilty for the way he treated her and his children over the years. Je told the friend he feels like a failure in life and won- ders if his kids would be better o if he were not around.

It includes one's thoughts, feel- ings, and attitudes. Personality traits are enduring patterns of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and oneself that are exhibited in a wide range of social and personal contexts. Personality development occurs in response to a number of biological and psychological influences. Theorists include Erik Erikson. Personality disorders occur when these traits become in- flexible and maladaptive, and cause either sig- nicant functional impairment or subjective distress (Townsend, 2012). Most people dis- play some traits of these disorders from time to time, but only when they are consistent be- haviors that contribute to some dysfunctionin dierent areas of life do they become per- sonality disorders. Personality disorders are frequently seen in the general population and may coexist with other psychiatric disorders. It is common that more than one personality disorder exists in these patients. Patients with these disorders can present challenges for the nurse as maladaptive mechanisms includ- ing manipulation are used to cope with the stresses of their illnesses. Cultural Considerations Personality development is impacted by culture. Thoughts, feelings, and attitudes are influenced by the cultural values surrounding people.2993_Ch14_217-230 14/01/14 5:25 PM Page 217There are 10 personality disorders as de- scribed in DSM-5. These 10 disorders are grouped in 3 clusters based on their similarities. 1.Cluster A (Behaviors described as odd) Paranoid personality disorder Schizoid personality disorder Schizotypal personality disorder 2.Cluster B (Behaviors described as dramatic) Antisocial personality disorder Borderline personality disorder Histrionic personality disorder Narcissistic personality disorder 3.Cluster C (Behaviors described as anxious or fearful) Avoidant personality disorder Dependent personality disorder Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Generally, the personality disorders include one or more of the following traits: Negative aect: frequently experiences negative emotions Detachment: withdrawal from others Antagonism: dicult to get along with Disinhibition: impulsive Inflexible Personality disorders often have their roots in dicult relationships with parental gures. Though each disorder has its own dynamics, this relationship is the thread that runs through all of them. Genetics may be a factor in some of these disorders as well.of other people. The person displays consis- tent mistrust of others' motives. These indi- viduals may seem \"normal\" in their speech and activity, except for the fact that they feel people treat them unfairly. People with para- noid personality disorder are prone to ling lawsuits when they feel wronged in some way. They also seem to be hypersensitive to activity in their environment. They tend to be guarded and secretive since they can't trust others. They may have diculty maintaining focused eye contact, for example, because they are so alert to other activity around them. People with paranoid personality disorder are not easily able to laugh at them- selves; they take themselves very seriously. They may not show tender emotions and may seem cold and calculating in their relation- ships. They are reluctant to conde in others. They tend to take comments, events, and situations very personally. They have an excessive need to be self-sucient which can create challenges if they become ill. As a general rule this person would probably avoid the health-care system if possible. Patients with paranoid personality disorder are not psychotic and do not have hallucinations and delusions; they are, however, suspicious of other people and situations. The suspiciousness may cross into other areas of the person's life. For instance, it may be very challenging to enlist the cooperation of a person with this disorder when it comes to taking medications if the patient suspects ulterior motives. Paranoid personality seems to have a high incidence of occurrence within families with schizophrenia, which supports the theories of the geneticists. Dicult parental relationships where the child is used as a scapegoat for par- ents' aggression can be a contributor as well.218 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Classroom Activities Watch lms that include people with personality disorders and discuss characteristics: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (antisocial), Fatal Attraction (borderline), Wall Street (narcissistic). Share experiences of people you have known who exhibit various personality disorders. Types of Personality Disorders Cluster A Paranoid Personality Disorder Individuals with paranoid personality present with behaviors of suspiciousness and mistrust Cultural Considerations Members of minority groups or immi- grants may be prone to some paranoid traits due to their unfamiliarity with soci- ety's rules and expectations. This would not be considered a paranoid personality disorder unless it becomes pervasive and creates more problems for the person. 2993_Ch14_217-230 14/01/14 5:25 PM Page 218Schizoid Personality Disorder People with schizoid personality disorder have a pattern of detachment from social relation- ships and a restricted range of expression of emotions in interpersonal settings. They may appear shy and introverted. They have trouble developing friendships. They tend to respond in a very serious, factual manner that is pleas- ant but not warm or inviting. They may be described by others as cold. It is unusual to see patients hospitalized for this disorder because they are so quiet that the disorder often goes unnoticed. They often are described by others as \"loners.\" It is common to see people with this type of personality become very engrossed in books. The books may be a substitute for human companion- ship. Partly because of this aversion to social interaction, people with schizoid personalities tend to be very intellectual and can be very successful in life if they choose a career that ts their personality. They may appear indif- ferent to the approval or criticism of others. It is believed that ineective and unemo- tional parenting may contribute to this disorder. A family history of schizophrenia or schizotypal personality disorder supports a genetic link. Schizotypal Personality Disorder Behavior in this disorder is often odd and ec- centric but not to the level of schizophrenia (see Chapter 15). Although under stress, this person may decompensate with psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucina- tions. Aloof and isolated, these individuals often appear to be in their own world with lan- guage and gestures that only they understand and reduced capacity for close relationships. Often appearing blank and apathetic, their emotional responses may seem inappropriate. They also may display paranoia and social anxiety. Diagnosis is made by a mental health professional who looks at symptoms and life history. Origins of this disorder may include poor relationships with parental gures where there is discomfort with aection and closeness, leading to distrust in personal relationships. In addition, this disorder is more common among rst-degree relatives of people withschizophrenia, giving strength to genetic and biological factors.CHAPTER 14|Personality Disorders 219 Tool Box |Psych Central overview on schizotypal personality disorder: psychcentral.com/disorders/sx 33.htm Cluster B Antisocial Personality Disorder This group of people probably causes the great- est amount of trouble for society. Sometimes referred to as sociopathic, people with this dis- order have a disregard for the rights of others. It often leads them to a path of violating rules, lying, stealing, participating in a variety of illegal activities, and other infringements of the law. The disorder seems to aect males more frequently than females and aects about 1% of the U.S. population (Lenzenweger, M. F ., Lane, M. C., Loranger, A. W., & Kessler, R. C. [2007]). The serial killer Ted Bundy is one of the best-known sociopaths. As these individu- als end up in the court systems, they may be- come part of the health-care system to avoid legal consequences or due to court order. These individuals have diculty handling frustration and anger. They seldom feel aection, loyalty, guilt, or remorse and show very little concern for the rights or feelings of anyone else. It is rare that they display true remorse for their acts. People who have this disorder are also at high risk for substance abuse. In addition, a pattern of impulsiveness and irresponsibility are major features, with actions poorly planned. This type of person has diculty with close relationships and may move from jobs and relationships frequently. In spite of the inability to feel or show af- fection, patients with antisocial/sociopathic personality disorder are usually gregarious, in- telligent, and likable but can quickly move to aggression if frustrated. Most people with this disorder are able to control their behavior out of fear of punishment; only those with extreme cases are unable to do so. Because people with antisocial personality disorder are frequently highly intelligent, they learn the \"jargon\" of psychology and know how to manipulate it. Those with 2993_Ch14_217-230 14/01/14 5:25 PM Page 219antisocial personality disorder are dicult to treat as the individual often has little moti- vation to change. It is widely believed that the roots of this disorder stem from dysfunctional parenting and family life. This may be from a permissive or authoritarian parenting style that does not include guidelines for appropriate social be- havior and includes abuse. A chaotic family life is often found. This personality disorder may be displayed in childhood with signs of callousness and lack of empathy. Some evi- dence also exists that there may be brain ab- normalities in how the individual processes emotions. Childhood bullying and cruelty, animal abuse, as well as manipulative behav- iors are seen at an early age. Individuals may have been diagnosed with conduct disorder before age 15 (see Chapter 19). These behav- iors can run in families, so a genetic link is also suspected. 20% of psychiatric inpatients (BPD Resource Center, 2012). Borderline personality disor- der (also known as BPD) is much more common in females. \"Instability\" is often the rst word one thinks of when considering BPD. Individuals with this disorder often ex- hibit both clinging and distancing behavior as they struggle with fears of separation and abandonment. They are known for intense and chaotic relationships as well as self- destructive, impulsive, and dramatic coping. A chronic sense of emptiness, poor self-image, and excessive self-criticism are part of this disorder. These individuals operate using in- grained behavior patterns that involve manip- ulating others to achieve their goals to reduce anxiety. These patients may also utilize self- mutilating behaviors, including self-inflicted cuts (known as cutting), which usually are not performed with suicidal intent. The cutting can be a way to reduce tension, inflict pain to validate one's feelings and challenge a perva- sive sense of emptiness, or seek attention. Substance abuse is also often a factor as the person tries to control the anxiety. The origins of BPD can include coming from an abusive background and a childhood where one was dismissed by authority gures. Poor relationships with parental gures where the child grows up facing issues around aban- donment and dependency are often seen. De- fense mechanisms of denial, projection, and splitting (inability to integrate positive and negative feelings at the same time) are known to be commonly used. Splitting is manifested by a patient who needs to see others as all good or all bad. For example, a nurse who is caring during one shift may become to the patient the idealized \"perfect\" nurse, and then the nurse who sets limits on another shift is called \"mean.\"220 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Patients with antisocial personality can be challenging as they can use unscrupulous means to accomplish their goals without the sta realizing it. Rather than telling the patient, \"you shouldn't do that,\" reword to \"you are expected to ...\" to establish clear expectations that you are not negotiating.Neeb's Tip Critical Thinking Question You are working on a substance abuse unit. When you walk on the unit, you see a patient named Brad with a number of nursing sta. He is telling funny anecdotes about celebrities, and many of the nurses seem to be enjoying themselves. Brad is quite handsome and charming. After this occur- rence, Brad asks one of the nurses for a special privilege to take a walk o the unit. How would you advise this nurse to handle this request? When the nurse denies the patient's request, he quickly changes from charming to cruel as he insults the nurse and then knocks over a lamp. How should the sta respond? Borderline Personality Disorder This diagnosis is the most frequent personal- ity disorder seen in the clinical setting, mak- ing up 2%-6% of the general population and Recognizing sta splitting is essential for good care of the patient. If a pa- tient complains about other sta members, never encourage him or her. Rather, point out that the patient needs to address the concerns with the individual and not complain about sta members to others. Avoid taking sides or acting as intermediary.Neeb's Tip2993_Ch14_217-230 14/01/14 5:25 PM Page 220Histrionic Personality Disorder This disorder is characterized by dramatic, ex- cessive, extroverted behavior in someone who has a pattern of strong emotions. Excessive attention seeking, seductive and provocative behaviors are additionally seen. Some may de- scribe the person as theatrical. They are known to be highly distractible and even flighty. Delaying gratication is dicult. Diculty inmaintaining close, intimate relationships is common despite the gregarious and seductive behaviors. This disorder is more common in women. Childhood experience of needing to be dra- matic to get recognition or needs met, lack of feedback from parents about appropriate be- havior all contribute to the development of this disorder.CHAPTER 14|Personality Disorders 221 Tool Box |AHRQ National Guidelines Clearinghouse on borderline personality 14327 & search= borderline+ personality# Section420 Clinical Activity When you are informed that your patient has a borderline personality, get specic information on interventions that the team has been using to avoid getting in the middle of conflict between the patient and sta. Though cutting behaviors are more common in adolescents, they can occur in adults.Neeb's Tip Tool Box |Borderline Personality Disorder pamphlet for patients and families: www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/border- line-personality-disorder/index .shtml BPD Central with information for patients and families: www.bpdcentral.com/ Critical Thinking Question A 25-year-old woman is admitted from the ER to your unit with supercial cuts on both arms, a high blood alcohol level, and a complaint that she was attacked by her boyfriend. She is emotional and angry. As you sit with her to complete the ad- mission, she shares with you that she cut her arms to get her boyfriend to \"love\" her. You are called out of the room. When you return, the patient yells at you and says she wants another nurse. She does not trust you. This patient was diagnosed with borderline personality. Describe why she may have reacted so negatively to you when you returned to the room. Figure 14-1 Self-inflicted lacerations on teenage girl's arms. Histrionic traits do not mean the person has histrionic personality disorder. To have the disorder, the person would have consistent problems functioning in life as a result of these traits. Neeb's Tip Narcissistic Personality Disorder Those who have this disorder tend to display an exaggerated impression of self with an inflated sense of self-importance. They are preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited suc- cess. Another characteristic is limited ability to empathize with others' problems because they see everything through their own eyes. They also tend to be hypersensitive when they receive criticism. They have a tendency to overestimate their abilities, are attention Cultural Considerations Cultural background can dictate social be- havior. So this should be taken into con- sideration when a diagnosis of histrionic disorder is being made.2993_Ch14_217-230 14/01/14 5:25 PM Page 221seeking, and are surprised if they do not re- ceive admiration from others. While project- ing an image of invulnerability, their deep sense of emptiness is hidden from others. These individuals have diculty maintaining close relationships. People with this disorder will seem to take criticism lightly. In reality, deep feelings of anger, resentment, and poor self-esteem are being repressed. Friends will be chosen ac- cording to how good they make the person with the narcissistic personality feel. Often these people are children of narcis- sistic parental gures who were critical and de- manding of their children. The children then model their behavior. Narcissistic traits are particularly common in adolescents though they will not necessarily have the personality disorder. Dependent Personality Disorder Dependent personality is a pervasive and ex- cessive need to be taken care of that leads to submissive and clinging behaviors and fears of separation. These behaviors tend to elicit caregiving response in others including nurses. People with dependent personality disorder want others to make decisions for them and tend to feel inferior and sug- gestible, with a sense of self-doubt. These individuals tend to appear helpless and to avoid responsibility. On the other hand, in- dividuals with this disorder tend to take everything to heart and go out of their way to satisfy people they feel close to and try to change those personality traits that people criticize. There seems to be an inordinate amount of fear among people who experience dependent personality disorder. It may be the fear of crit- icism that brings about the inability to make decisions. Inability to make decisions can be severe enough as to limit a person's ability to have meaningful social interactions. In addi- tion recognition that overuse of dependency behaviors can lead to a disturbed nurse- patient relationship. Seriously overprotective parents who dis- courage independence and promote de- pendence in the child for the parents' needs can be a contributing factor. Chronic phys- ical illness in childhood can predispose to this disorder. 222 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Critical Thinking Question You are working on a psychiatric unit, and your patient with narcissistic disorder tells you that she plans to get the lead in a play once she leaves the hospital. She tells you she has always been success- ful in every audition she has had. What concerns would you have for this patient? How would you respond to her statements? Cluster C Avoidant Personality Disorder These individuals are extremely sensitive and may avoid social situations to protect themselves from possible rejection. However, these people also have a strong need to be accepted. Often labeled shy, these individuals are awkward in social situations. They often view others as crit- ical. They want a close relationship but avoid it because of fear of being rejected. Characteristics include low self-esteem, avoidance of close rela- tionships, anxiety, and anhedonia, or lack of pleasure in life. They are very hesitant to engage in new activities due to fear of failure. Highly critical parental gures are believed to be the origin. There also may be a hereditary link. The patient with avoidant personal- ity disorder desperately wants social contact but goes to lengths to dis- courage it out of fear of rejection.Neeb's Tip Cultural Considerations Nurses must be cautioned here because the behaviors that have been discussed as symptomatic of dependent personality disorder are behaviors and conditions that are expected in certain cultures, especially among females. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder These individuals are disciplined and rigid to an extreme. They are meticulous and de- mand accuracy and discipline in others. They are preoccupied with details, rules, and2993_Ch14_217-230 14/01/14 5:25 PM Page 222order. They display a stubborn streak in order to maintain control so things are done their way. They may appear polite and for- mal but can be autocratic and critical with others. They demonstrate persistence at tasks long after the behavior has ceased to be func- tional or effective and continuance of the same behavior despite repeated failures or obvious annoyance by others. The fear of making mistakes can lead to an inability to make any decisions. The origins include overcontrolling par- ents, and the disorder does run in families. This personality disorder diers from what is known as OCD (obsessive-compulsive disor- der). OCD is a disorder that is characterized by obsessions and compulsions in an eort to maintain control (Chapter 10). Psychiatric Treatment of Personality Disorders Because these personality disorders become engrained early in life, treatment is often difficult. People with personality disorders may not seek treatment as part of their disorder until the disorder drains their coping reserves. At times they will demon- strate resistance to treatment. T reatment may be pushed on them after a crisis or due to entrance into the legal system. Psy- chotherapy, cognitive behavior therapy, and group therapy may be useful in some situations. Maintaining a long-standing trusting relationship with a therapist can be advantageous. Medications to treat anx- iety, depression, and delusions are often used. Family members of people with personality disorders often benefit from family therapy and psycho-education around coping with them. Nursing Care of Patients With Personality Disorders Common nursing diagnoses with personality disorders include the following: Coping, defensive Personal identity, disturbed Self-esteem, disturbed Self-mutilation, risk for Social interactions, impaired Violence, self-directed, risk forCHAPTER 14|Personality Disorders 223 Though people with personality dis- orders may not seek mental health treatment, they often use the health-care system for other prob- lems. Patients with personality dis- orders present many challenges to nurses. These patients may display rigid behavior patterns and be so- cially inappropriate.Neeb's Tip Pharmacology Corner Many patients with these disorders experi- ence anxiety, so anti-anxiety medications are often prescribed. Borderline patients have been treated with SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) to manage impulsivity. Antipsychotics may be used with patients with psychotic features such as schizotypal disorders. For patients prone to violence, an- tipsychotics may also be needed. Because many of these patients are susceptible to substance abuse to self-medicate, close mon- itoring of drug abuse should be included in the treatment plan. Compliance with a prescribed med- ication regimen can be challenging. Some may have a tendency to avoid following instructions or act impulsively.Neeb's Tip Critical Thinking Question Your patient with a diagnosis of avoidant person- ality requests alprazolam before group therapy session. Describe what this medication accom- plishes for the patient and alternative approaches in place of medication.

CASE STUDY 1.Which behaviors in this case study are indicative of this diagnosis? 2.What treatment options are used to treat this disorder? 3.What medications would you expect her to have prescribed?Marsha is a 25-year-old woman who is brought to the emergency room by her girlfriend after threatening to take sleep- ing pills when her boyfriend broke off their relationship. On questioning Marsha, she acknowledges a long history of prob- lems. She has made multiple suicide attempts, which include cutting her arms and taking handfuls of sleeping pills. Each attempt occurred after a rejection by a boyfriend or in earlier years by her parents. Marsha describes falling in love easily and a history of intense relation- ships that often are discontinued by the man after Marsha becomes increasingly clinging and demanding. She describes a chaotic childhood in which her mother was away a lot and Marsha moved around to live with a variety of relatives. She barely nished high school and has struggled to nd unskilled jobs. On interviewing her you nd her cheer- ful and charming. She does not appear depressed. When you leave the room to at- tend to another patient, she cries out that she is being ignored. She calls multiple friends to visit in the ER so she will not be alone, thus creating a chaotic environment that must be monitored by security. Her long-term psychiatrist comes to see her and tells you she is treating Marsha for borderline personality disorder. REFERENCES American Psychiatric Association. (2013).

Schizophrenia is a serious, chronic, psychiatric disorder characterized by impaired reality testing, hallucinations, delu- sions, and limited socialization. It is a psy- chotic thought disorder where hallucinations and delusions dominate the patient's think- ing, leading to confusing and bizarre behav- iors. People with schizophrenia have a \"split\" between their thoughts and their feelings and between their reality and society's reality, which can lead to unusual and frightening be- haviors. Schizophrenia is a frequent cause for long psychiatric hospitalizations. The suer- ing for a schizophrenic patient and his/her family can last a lifetime as this crippling condition continues. As a chronic illness, schizophrenia is characterized by remissions and exacerbations throughout one's life. The rst psychotic break often responds well to treatment, but the relapse rate is high and the person may become increasingly disabled. Schizophrenic individuals are vulnerable to substance abuse as they self-medicate to control their symptoms, contributing to co-occurring disorder (see Chapter 17). These patients can also be at risk for suicide, which may be manifested as voices telling the person to kill her/himself or a means to end suffering. DSM-5 now categorizes schizophrenia under the global title of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (2013). In the past, schizophrenia was divided into ve subtypes of catatonic,2993_Ch15_231-244 14/01/14 5:25 PM Page 231delusional, disorganized, undierentiated, and residual, but in 2013 these were eliminated. The new term of schizophrenia spectrum dis- orders reflects a gradient of psychopathology that a patient can experience from least to most severe. Disorders such as schizophreniform and schizoaective would be the less severe forms. See Table 15-1 for other disorders with schiz- ophrenic features. In addition, psychoses can occur in bipolar disorder and major depression. Another psy- chotic disorder is brief psychotic disorder, which includes postpartum psychosis (see Chapter 20) as well as psychosis due to sub- stance abuse or medical conditions. Medical conditions that can contribute to psychoses include brain tumors, CNS infections, delir- ium, and endocrine disorders. All of these dis- orders, though not schizophrenia, have some of the same symptoms but dierent etiology and duration of disability.232 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Figure 15-1 Eugen Bleuler (1857-1940) was a Swiss psychiatrist who coined the term schizo- phrenia and contributed to the understanding of the disorder. Sudden onset of hallucinations and delusions requires quick action to identify the cause. Causes can in- clude medical conditions, metabolic changes, and drug reactions.Neeb's Tip Classroom Activities View and discuss movies that feature schizo- phrenic characters, including A Beautiful Mind and I Never Promised You a Rose Garden. Critical Thinking Question Your patient has a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder. How is this dierent from a diagnosis of schizophrenia? lTable 15-1 Other Disorders With Schizophrenic Features Type Characteristics Delusional Delusions without the Disorder other symptoms or dis- abilities of schizophrenia Schizoaffective Symptoms of schizophre- nia along with symptoms of major depression or manic episode that re- quires treatment of both disorders Schizophreniform Schizophrenia symp- toms without the level of impairment of function- ing usually seen in schiz- ophrenia and lasting more than 1 month and fewer than 6 months Schizotypal A personality disorder characterized by odd and eccentric behavior that does not decom- pensate to the level of schizophrenia (see Chapter 14) Source: Adapted from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (Copyright 2013). American Psychiatric Association, Townsend (2012), and Goldberg (2007).2993_Ch15_231-244 14/01/14 5:25 PM Page 232Frequently, schizophrenia is initially diag- nosed in adolescents and younger adults be- tween the ages of 16 and 35 with the occurrence of the rst psychotic break, though later onset does occur. A common scenario is a young person who has left home for college or the mil- itary and suddenly exhibits psychotic behavior (Fig. 15-2), though premorbid personality may indicate this individual was withdrawn, had problems with social relationships, and exhib- ited possible antisocial behavior. Schizophrenia is rare in young children. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) estimates that nearly 3 million Americans will develop schizophrenia during the course of their lives. That is about 1.1% of the U.S. population (National Institute of Mental Health, 2012). CHAPTER 15|Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 233 symptoms are those found among people who do not have the disorder but are missing or lacking among individuals with schizo- phrenia and reflect a lessening or loss of nor- mal functions. These may include avolition (a lack of desire or motivation to accomplish goals), lack of desire to form social relation- ships, inappropriate social behavior such as pacing or rocking, and blunted aect and emotion. These symptoms make holding a job, forming relationships, and other day-to-day functions especially dicult for people with schizophrenia. Positive symptoms are those that are found among people with schizophrenia but not present among those who do not have the dis- order. They reflect an excess or distortion of normal functions such as delusions, thought disorders, and hallucinations. People with schizophrenia may hear voices other people don't hear or believe other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts, or plotting to harm them. Other positive symp- toms can include magical thinking (belief that one's thoughts can control others), neologisms (invents new words that only have meaning to the individual), concrete thinking (literal in- terpretation of the environment), loose asso- ciations (ideas shift from unrelated one to another), echopraxia (repeating movements of Cultural Considerations Schizophrenia crosses all races and cultures. Figure 15-2 Schizophrenia can create extreme distress. Classroom Activities Contact a local NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) support group and attend a meeting if possible. Symptoms The presence of delusions, hallucinations, and/or disorganized speech for a signi- cant portion of time during a 1-month period. At least one of these must be present for the diagnosis. Grossly abnormal motor behavior and/ or negative symptoms (see below for explanation) One or more areas of functioning, such as work, school, personal relationships, or self-care, are impaired. Some disturbance needs to be evident for at least 6 months. Schizophrenia can also have features of catatonia, which include any of the fol- lowing: motor immobility to stupor, ex- cessive motor activity, peculiar voluntary movements, and echolalia or echopraxia. Schizophrenia's symptoms (parrot-like repeating words spoken by others). Most schizophrenics have a mixture of both positive and negative symptoms. See Tables 15-2 and 15-3 for lists of com- mon delusions and hallucinations.234 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Cultural Considerations One's culture often influences the content of hallucinations and delusions. Familiar- ity with the patient's culture can provide insight into the origin of some of these behaviors. Schizophrenia is a debilitating and painful lifelong disease for the pa- tient and family requiring long-term management and compassion.Neeb's Tip Etiology of Schizophrenia No single cause has been identied, but it is now known that schizophrenia is a brain dis- order. Disruption of neurotransmitters, in- cluding dopamine, has been identied. Some dysfunction in neuron functioning has also been found. Some cerebral changes in the brain have also been suggested in the limbic system and prefrontal cortex. These factors may contribute to the problems with atten- tion and information processing.

Psychosocial Nursing for General Patient Care, 3rd ed. Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company, with permission. Cultural Considerations Behaviors that may be normal in some cultures can be confused with psychotic behavior. For example, speaking in tongues and talking to spirits may be normal behavior in some cultures. If psychotic behavior is suspected, it is important to obtain information on what is normal behavior for the culture of your patient.2993_Ch15_231-244 14/01/14 5:25 PM Page 234CHAPTER 15|Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 235 is unable to lter stimuli, leading to disor- ganization of mental functioning. While family dysfunction may exist, it appears that psychological factors by themselves do not cause this condition. There is also evidence of genetic predisposition, and the most sig- nicant risk factor is having a close relative with this disorder. Psychiatric Treatment of Schizophrenia A comprehensive, multidisciplinary treat- ment plan including pharmacotherapy, so- cial support, social/life skills training, self-help groups, and family therapy can be helpful to maintain the patient effectively. Gaining life skills to deal with everyday challenges, occupational training, and fam- ily education have been helpful. Intensive individual psychotherapy is generally not as effective, but reality-based therapy to pro- mote trust can be incorporated into the plan. Ongoing support can promote com- pliance with antipsychotic medications. Management of antipsychotic medications is generally the primary treatment. See Pharmacology Corner.

Most people respond to one of the typical or atypical agents to a degree at the first psy- chotic episode. Typical antipsychotics have been around since the 1950s and work by blocking postsynaptic dopamine receptors. Pharmacology Corner Antipsychotic medications are key to a pa- tient's returning to a stable state. Once achieved, maintenance therapy is established to prevent exacerbations. Most schizophren- ics will relapse once o their medications, so incorporating a plan for medication compli- ance is essential. Once established on appro- priate medications, the patient is usually more open to counseling and supportive in- terventions. It can take time to establish the appropriate medication and dosages so the patient and family must be monitored closely. Some patients may require longer periods of trials for months or even years to nd the best available medication, the right dosage, and manageable side-eect prole. A trial of any one medication should last for a substantial period, usually 6 to 8 weeks, unless intolerable side eects occur early. These agents are generally used to treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotics have been available since the 1990s and are weaker dopamine receptor an- tagonists but more potent antagonists of serotonin receptors. New atypicals are added to the market regularly. These drugs treat both the positive and negative symptoms and generally have fewer side effects. Even though the atypical agents have a better side- effect profile for long-term treatment, the typical or older agents may be chosen for short-term management of psychosis or long-term management of symptoms that do not respond to the atypical agents. See Table 15-4 for a list of the common typical and atypical antipsychotics with their side- effect profile. Most of these agents are avail- able only in oral form. A few are available as a long-acting injection that is given every few weeks. These include haloperidol, fluphenazine, and risperidone. These can be effective if a patient refuses or is unable to take oral medications. Some medications come in liquid forms or quick dissolving tablets, which can also be useful if the pa- tient is not cooperative with taking oral medication. 2993_Ch15_231-244 14/01/14 5:25 PM Page 235236 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health lTable 15-4 Comparison of Side Effects Among Typical and Atypical Antipsychotic Agents Anti- Orthostatic Weight cholinergic Hypotension Gain Typicals Chlorpromazine 3 4 3 4 * (Thorazine) Fluphenazine 5 2 2 2 (Prolixin) Haloperidol 5 2 2 2 (Haldol) Loxapine 3 2 2 2 * (Loxitane) Perphenazine 4 2 2 2 * (Trilafon) Pimozide 4 2 3 2 * (Orap) Prochlorperazine 3 2 2 2 * (Compazine) Thioridazine 2 4 4 4 * (Mellaril) Thiothixene 4 2 2 2 * (Navane) Trifluoperazine 4 2 2 2 * (Stelazine) Atypicals Aripiprazole 1 2 1 3 2 (Abilify) Asenapine 1 3 1 3 4 (Saphris) Clozapine 1 5 5 4 5 (Clozaril) Iloperidone 1 3 2 3 3 (Fanapt) Lurasidone 1 3 1 3 3 (Latuda) Olanzapine 1 3 2 2 5 (Zyprexa) Palperidone 1 2 1 3 2 (Invega) Quetiapine 1 3 1 3 4 (Seroquel) Risperidone 1 2 1 3 4 (Risperdal) Ziprasidone 1 3=moderate, 4=high, incidence unknown. Source: From Townsend (2012): Psychiatric Mental 236Managing the side eects of antipsychotics can promote patient compliance. Typical an- tipsychotics are more prone to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) as well as anticholinergic eects, though the drugs can be particularly ef- fective in controlling psychotic symptoms. See Box 15-1 and Table 15-5 for lists of extrapyra- midal and anticholinergic side eects. Ex- trapyramidal symptoms are diphenhydramine. The atypicals are generally less associated with extrapyramidal symptoms than the typ- ical agents, but there is a wide range of other side eects, so close monitoring of the pre- scribed drug is essential. Some atypicals are prone to anticholinergic eects. Serious side eects in specic atypicals can include re- duced seizure threshold, blood dyscrasias, and cardiac arrhythmias. One of the most serious is agranulocytosis, which is a rare blood com- plication of clozapine requiring close moni- toring of the white blood cell count. The specic side eects of the atypicals must be reviewed and monitored whenever these drugs are ordered.CHAPTER 15|Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 237 Critical Thinking Question You realize your schizophrenic patient has been \"cheeking\" his risperidone (hiding the pill in his cheek). What might be some of the reasons the patient is doing this? Identify two alternatives for taking this medication. Compliance to antipsychotics re- mains a lifelong challenge for the schizophrenic patient and his/her family. It is important to regularly monitor medication compliance and the current side-eect prole. Education must be reinforced each time the patient is seen in any health-care setting.Neeb's Tip Extrapyramidal symptoms can be devastating to quality of life. Close monitoring to treat these and pre- vent long-term consequences must be part of the treatment plan.Neeb's Tip Tool Box |Abnormal Involuntary Move- ment Scale (AIMS): This tool is a rating scale developed by the National Institute of Mental Health to measure involuntary movements as- sociated with tardive dyskinesia (available at: www.atlantapsychiatry.com/forms/AIM S.pdf Clinical Activity Review chart for CBC results if the patient is on clozapine.

Critical Thinking Question Your patient with schizophrenia has been taking clozapine for 2 years. He is now in the hospital and is NPO awaiting an appendectomy.

Com- mon nursing diagnoses for the schizophrenic patient include: Self-care decit Sensory perception, disturbed Social isolation Thought processes, disturbed Violence, risk for General Nursing Interventions Watch for clues that patient is hallucinat- ing, e.g., darting eyes, mumbling to self, staring at a vacant wall for long periods. You can also ask the patient if he is hear- ing voices. If the patient is hallucinating, your response could be, \"I don't see the devil standing there, but I understand how upsetting this is for you.\" In this way you are acknowledg- ing what the patient is experiencing with- out reinforcing it as your reality. If your patient is delusional, reinforce re- ality, \"that man works for the hospital not the FBI,\" \"Yes, there was a man at the nurse's station, but I did not hear him talk about you.\" Remind the patient he hassome control to look at alternative ways to view reality. Work to slowly build trust in small ways. Avoid overreacting to patient's bizarre behavior or appearance Maintain a calm, consistent environment with a regular routine Even though he/she appears to be in an- other world, continue to include the patient in conversations and activities. Acknowledge his/her presence and importance. Focus on reality, e.g., rather than listen to a long monologue about a delusion, talk about the schedule for the day. Never argue with the patient about what he or she is experiencing. Incorporate Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) competencies to main- tain a safe environment for the psychotic patient (qsen.org), e.g., remove sharp objects, provide adequate supervision. Take action to provide medications before agitation escalates. Make sure there are orders for prn medications for agitation. Never reinforce hallucinations, delusions, or illusions. An example of an inappropri- ate response is, \"Jesus wants you to take these pills,\" That response reinforces the delusion about Jesus. Avoid whispering or laughing when the pa- tient cannot hear the whole conversation; such behavior can promote paranoia. Avoid putting the patient into situations that are competitive or embarrassing. Build trust by using therapeutic commu- nication skills. If the patient is catatonic, provide for basic physical needs and safety, and make brief supportive contacts with the patient with- out pressuring the patient to communicate. Table 15-6 provides the nursing care plan for patients with schizophrenia.238 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health lTable 15-5 Anticholinergic Effects Symptom Action Dry mouth Oer sugarless candy, good oral hygiene, saliva substitute Orthostatic Instruct patient to get out of hypotension bed slowly, monitor BP Constipation Promote high-ber diet, flu- ids, stool softeners, laxatives as needed Urinary Instruct patient to report retention symptoms promptly Dry eye Lubricant eye drops Source: Adapted from Gorman and Sultan (2008). Psychosocial Nursing for General Patient Care, 3rd ed. Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company, with permission. It is important for the nurse to avoid reinforcing psychotic thinking, as in delusions. For example, avoid asking the patient what \"they\" are telling the patient. Rather, let the patient know you are concerned but do not hear these voices.Neeb's Tip2993_Ch15_231-244 14/01/14 5:25 PM Page 238See Table 15-7 for interventions for patients with schizophrenia who are hallucinating.

His mother is in the room and is trying to comfort the patient. What approaches might be helpful for the patient and his mother?2993_Ch15_231-244 14/01/14 5:25 PM Page 239240 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health lTable 15-7 Suggested Interventions for Patients With Schizophrenia Who Are Hallucinating Suggested Action Rationale 1.\"Mr. R, I don't see any bugs. It is time for lunch. I will walk to the dining room with you.\" 2. \"I see a crack in the wall, Mr. R. It is harmless; you are safe. Susan is here to take you down to Occupational Therapy now.\" 3. \"I know that your thoughts seem very real to you, Ms. C, but they do not seem logical to me. I would like you to come to your room and get dressed now, please.\" 4. \"Ms. C, It appears to me that you are listening to someone. Are you hearing voices other than mine?\" 5. \"Thank you, Ms. C. I want to help you focus away from the other voices. I am real; they are not. Please come with me to the reading room.\"1.This lets the patient know you heard him but brings him immediately into the reality of time of day and the need to go to the dining room. 2. This is in response to a probable illusion. It lets the patient know that you see some- thing. It validates his fear but tells him what you see and then moves him into the here and now. 3. Again, you are validating the patient's con- cern without exploring and focusing on the delusion. 4. This is a method of validating your impres- sion of what you see. This is as far as you will go into exploring what she may be hearing. 5. In this statement, you respond to her in the present and reinforce her response to you. This response attempts to redirect her thinking. Source: Adapted from Gorman and Sultan (2008). Psychosocial Nursing for General Patient Care, 3rd ed. Philadelphia: F.A.

Key Concepts 1.Schizophrenia is a chronic, serious, often debilitating psychiatric disorder that im- pacts all aspects of the patient's life and his/her loved ones. 2.Schizophrenia is now known to be a brain disorder. 3.Not all psychoses are schizophrenia. Other psychotic disorders can include brief psychotic disorder, psychosis in bipolar disorder, substance abuse, and major depression. 4.Schizophrenia is now viewed as a spec- trum disorder, which means there is a gradient of less to more severe conditions. Schizophrenia is usually diagnosed in a person's late teens and young adulthood but often continues for the rest of the patient's life. 5.Hallucinations and delusions are exam- ples of positive symptoms that present challenges to all health-care professionals. 6.The main treatment for schizophrenia re- mains antipsychotic medications. Be- cause of the side-eect prole of these medications, close monitoring is needed to achieve the best outcomes and patient compliance. 2993_Ch15_231-244 14/01/14 5:25 PM Page 240CHAPTER 15|Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 241 CASE STUDY 1.How should you respond to Ralph when rst meeting him? 2.How would you respond to the parents' fears? 3.What medications might be useful for this patient?Ralph is a 20-year-old college student who is admitted to your psychiatric facility by his parents. Ralph is in his second year at an out-of-state college. Over the past 6 months, he has been exhibiting increasingly bizarre behavior, such as walking the halls of his dorm at night knocking on doors, asking strange questions, mumbling to himself, and sleeping on the floor during the day. He has also been exhibiting disruptive behaviors in class. Students report being afraid of him and he has become increasingly isolated. Most recently he became violent in the school cafeteria. Then the school counselorreported to his parents that he needed immediate hospitalization. The parents report that Ralph had a normal childhood and never displayed any unusual behavior until the last year. The parents tell you they feel guilty that they did not monitor his behavior more closely in the last few months. On meeting Ralph he avoids eye contact and appears to be talking to someone he sees in the corner of the room. When his parents walk into the room, he begins hit- ting his head repeatedly against the wall. REFERENCES American Psychiatric Association. (2000).

In the past these were re- ferred to as organic mental syndromes and disorders by the American Psychiatric Associ- ation. The disorders in this category all in- clude decits in cognitive function. Delirium Delirium is an acute reaction to underlying physiological (e.g., toxins, drug reactions, illness) or psychological stress (e.g., sensory overload). It is a temporary condition that is characterized by a disturbance in attention (i.e., reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention) and orientation to the environment. For example, the patient may need questions repeated due to inattention, is easily distracted, or needs repeated orientation to the situation. It can also includememory decit, language disturbance, and/or perceptual disturbance. Delirium may in- clude alterations in sleep-wake cycle, including hypervigilant state to stupor. The patient may exhibit nocturnal delirium, known as sundown- ing, when confusion and agitation increase at dusk. See Table 16-1 for types of delirium with common symptoms. Delirium usually develops quickly and often fluctuates throughout the day. The condition often resolves once the cause is identied and treated. Delirium should be con- sidered when the person exhibits sudden onset of confusion, memory impairment, incoherence, fluctuating levels of consciousness, sleep-wake cycle disruption, hallucinations, and/or delusions. Delirium is an extremely common condi- tion seen in the acute hospital, nursing home, and home settings, particularly in the elderly. DSM-5 reports that delirium occurs in 15%- 53% of older individuals postoperatively and 70%-87% of those in ICU. The condition also2993_Ch16_245-260 14/01/14 5:26 PM Page 245contributes to mortality. DSM-IV-TR reports that 15% of elderly people die within one month of an episode of delirium. Common causes can include electrolyte imbalance, poor oxygenation, medication side eects or misuse, urinary tract infections, and dehydration. See Table 16-2 for a more comprehensive list of causes. Identifying the cause can be challenging in people with complex medical conditions, as multiple factors may contribute to the delirium. Substance-induced delirium is a separate cate- gory when delirium developed during or within a month after severe intoxication or withdrawal from a substance capable of producing delirium. Treatment of Delirium T reatment of delirium must be focused on nding and treating the cause. Often symp- toms of delirium can resolve quickly once the appropriate treatment for the cause is begun. Supportive interventions to maintain patient safety, control agitation, prevent further com- plications, and reorient can be very helpful.246 UNIT 2|Threats Hypoactive- Hyperactive- Assessments Hypoalert Hyperalert Mixed Level of alertness Motor activity Ability to follow commands Thinking abilityAlternates between hyper- alert and hypoalert states within hours or days Alternates within one episode of delirium Alternates between hypoac- tive and hyperactive states, may be unpredictable Alternates between hypoac- tive and hyperactive states in an unpredictable mannerOverly attentive to cues Moves quickly May be combat- ive, pulls at tubes, tries to climb out of bed Easily distracted, Rambles May mumble, swear, or yellLethargic, falls asleep between questions, dicult to arouse Decreased activity Follows a simple command, e.g., lift your foot Is passively cooperative Diculty in focusing attention, disorganized Source: Adapted from Forrest et al. (2007) and Gorman & Sultan (2008). Pharmacology Corner Prescribing medications to control delirium symptoms is risky because these medications can mask or compound the confusion and agitation. However, at times low-dose an- tipsychotic medications such as haloperidol, risperdal, and olanzapine may be needed to address agitation. The benets of the med- ications must be weighed against the possible side eects. Generally, anti-anxiety medica- tions like lorazepam should be avoided as they further confuse the picture of alterations in consciousness. Clinical Activity If your patient has a delirium diagnosis or exhibits a sudden change in consciousness and/or behav- ior, review his or her medical record for possible causes, including medication side eects, recent lab results, and recent infections. Your patient with delirium needs to be monitored closely. He can appear normal at times and then suddenly become agitated and try to get out of bed unsupervised.Neeb's Tip Critical Thinking Question An 81-year-old woman is admitted from the ER with a diagnosis of delirium manifested by acute confusion, rambling speech, and new onset of incontinence. Her husband reports this all started 24 hours ago after several episodes of diarrhea. She had recently been in the hospital for compli- cations from diabetes. List the possible causes of delirium that should be evaluated.2993_Ch16_245-260 14/01/14 5:26 PM Page 246Dementia Dementia is dened as a gradual loss of pre- vious levels of cognitive functioning, which can include memory, language, executive functions (includes organizing), and attention in a state of being fully alert. In DSM-5 it is classied as a major neurocognitive disorder. In contrast to delirium, dementia is a slowly progressive condition that eventually impacts all aspects of mental and social functioning. Primary dementias, including Alzheimer's disease, are those where the dementia itself is the major cause. Secondary dementia, includ- ing vascular and HIV-related, is caused by another disease or condition. Depression is a common disorder in the elderly. Sometimes depression can mimic dementia; in that case, it is referred to as pseudodementia. Depression in the elderly can be confused with dementia with the following symptoms: Forgetfulness Little eort to complete responsibilities Limited communication One dierentiation is that the depressed patient generally remains oriented to time and place, unlike the dementia patient. Alzheimer's Disease This most common form of dementia was initially recognized by Dr. Alois Alzheimer in1906 as a form of impairment of brain func- tion (Fig. 16-1). Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60%-80% of dementias. It is estimated that 13% of Americans over 65 years old have this diagnosis and incidence increases with age. The impact on society is a major one as people are living longer. It is not rev ersible. Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The cause of death is often aspiration pneumonias, infections, and com- plications from falls, which are all outcomes CHAPTER 16|Neurocognitive Disorders: Delirium and Dementia 247 lTable 16-2 Causes of Delirium Biological Factors Other Factors Hypoxia Nutritional deciencies, e.g., iron, B12 Electrolyte imbalances, e.g., calcium Hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia Renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy Sepsis and other infections including UTI Metabolic disorders, e.g., acid-base imbalance Medication or anesthesia reaction Hypothyroidism Cardiac insuciency Primary brain disorders, e.g., brain tumors, Parkinson's disease PainMedication side eect Anesthesia reaction abuse/withdrawal, e.g., alcohol, cannabis, opioids, anxiolytics, sedatives Sensory overload and deprivation Head trauma Source: Gorman & Sultan (2008) and Townsend (2012).

See Box 16-1 for the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and Box 16-2 for warning signs. In addition to symptom assessment, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is made by MRI or PET scan, which can detect physical and chemical changes in the brain. The changes seen in the brain include development of plaque (chemical deposits made of degen- erating nerve cells and proteins called beta amyloid) and tangles (malformed nerve cells). These plaques and tangles are greatly increased in someone with this form of dementia. As they increase, they create a toxic environment for normal brain cells. It is known that an enzyme used to produce the neurochemicalacetylcholine is reduced as well. Some of the medications that are being used to slow the progression of this disease increase the level of acetylcholine. There are genetic markers for some forms of this disease. Research is ongoing as to the causes of these brain changes (Fig. 16-2). A rare form of the disease is ge- netic and accounts for less than 5% of cases. Other specic causes are still unclear. The presence of the diagnosis of mild neu- rocognitive disorder (previously called mild cognitive impairment) is a risk factor. Mild neurocognitive disorder is a condition in which a person has mild decits with mem- ory, language, or another essential cognitive ability. The person begins making changes in his/her life to compensate for these, and it begins to aect daily living. Mild cognitive disorder is not normal aging. Many people fear that forgetfulness is a sign of developing Alzheimer's disease. See Table 16-3 for the differences between Alzheimer's disease and normal aging. The Stages of Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's disease has been divided into stages. STAGE 1: N OIMPAIRMENT (NORMAL FUNCTION ) The person does not experience any mem- ory problems.

At this stage, those with Alzheimer's may: Be unable to recall their own address or telephone number, or the high school or college from which they graduated Become confused about where they are or what day it is Have trouble with less challenging mental arithmetic; e.g., counting backward from 40 by subtracting 4s or from 20 by 2s Need help choosing proper clothing for the season or the occasion Still remember signicant details about themselves and their family Still require no assistance with eating or using the toilet STAGE 6: S EVERE COGNITIVE DECLINE (MODERATELY SEVERE OR MID -STAGE ALZHEIMER 'SDISEASE ) Memory continues to worsen, personality changes may take place, and individuals need extensive help with daily activities. At this stage, individuals may: Lose awareness of recent experiences as well as of their surroundings Remember their own name but have diculty with their personal history Distinguish familiar and unfamiliar faces but have trouble remembering the name of a spouse or caregiver Need help dressing properly and may, without supervision, make mistakes such as putting pajamas over daytime clothes or shoes on the wrong feet Experience major changes in sleep patterns\u2014sleeping during the day and becoming restless at night Need help handling details of toileting (for example, flushing the toilet, wiping or disposing of tissue properly) Have increasingly frequent trouble controlling their bladder or bowels Experience major personality and behav- ioral changes, including suspiciousness and delusions (such as believing that their caregiver is an impostor) or compulsive, repetitive behavior like hand-wringing or tissue shredding Tend to wander or become lost STAGE 7: V ERYSEVERE COGNITIVE DECLINE (SEVERE OR LATE -STAGE ALZHEIMER 'SDISEASE ) In the nal stage of this disease, individuals lose the ability to respond to their environ- ment, to carry on a conversation, and, even- tually, to control movement. They may still say words or phrases. At this stage, individuals need help with much of their daily personal care, including eating or using the toilet. They may also lose the ability to smile, to sit with- out support, and to hold their head up. Re- flexes become abnormal. Muscles grow rigid. Swallowing is impaired.

Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease No treatment is available to stop the deteri- oration of brain cells in Alzheimer's disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has currently approved ve drugs that temporarily slow worsening of symptoms for about 6 to 12 months (see the Pharmacology Corner). However, researchers around the world are studying numerous treatment strategies that may have the potential to change the course of the disease. Approxi- mately 75 to 100 experimental therapies aimed at slowing or stopping the progres- sion of Alzheimer's are in clinical testing in human volunteers (Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's Disease 2013 Facts and Figures, 2013). In addition to the medications, supportive care, maintaining safety, prevention of infec- tions, and caregiver support are the major interventions. Once diagnosed, the patient and his/her family need to develop a plan to provide care as the disease progresses. This is important in the early stages so the patient can participate in decisions about future care while he/she still can. For example, identify- ing options for home caregivers or facilities in the area based on the patient's wishes can be documented early on. Family members of Alzheimer's patients need to be prepared for what to expect as it progresses (Fig. 16-3).CHAPTER 16|Neurocognitive Disorders: Delirium and Dementia 251 Classroom Activity View and discuss recent movies that address dementia, including Iron Lady, The Savages, and The Notebook. Clinical Activity If your patient has dementia, talk with patient's family about how they are coping. Figure 16-3 Alzheimer's disease makes a tremen- dous impact on the family. People with early-stage Alzheimer's disease should be encouraged to complete an advance directive so they can document their wishes for care and treatment as the disease progresses.Neeb's Tip Pharmacology Corner Cholinesterase inhibitors are the class of medications used in treatment of early to moderate Alzheimer's disease. They are ef- fective for only about half of the individuals who take them. These drugs act by inhibit- ing acetylcholinesterase, which increases the concentrations of acetylcholine in the brain. They have been found to slow the process of dementia in some people but not control it. Another medication, memantine, is used in moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. It works as a receptor antagonist of N -methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) and has been shown to slow down progression of cognitive de- cline and daily functioning in some patients with more advanced disease. The two types of drugs may be given together in some cases. See Table 16-4 for the cholinesterase inhibitors used to treat Alzheimer's demen- tia. Early treatment with these medications with mild neurocognitive disorder may be helpful. When extreme agitation requires the use of antipsychotic medications in dementia Continued2993_Ch16_245-260 14/01/14 5:26 PM Page 251Other Forms of Dementia The second most common form of dementia is vascular and is caused by small strokes which over time result in interruption of blood flow to the brain. Vascular dementia is sometimes referred to as multi-infarct de- mentia. Progression of this form of dementia can vary from Alzheimer's disease depending on the occurrence of vascular events, i.e., progression of dementia occurs with each new stroke. So an individual with vascular dementia can remain stable for longer peri- ods if there are no new strokes. There are a number of other forms of dementia includ- ing dementia associated with Parkinson's disease, Lewy bodies, substance abuse, HIV, and traumatic brain injury among others. These dementias can also exist in the mild neurocognitive disorder forms as in mild252 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Pharmacology Corner\u2014 cont'd patients, it must be recognized that the FDA has ordered black-box warnings on atypical antipsychotics due to increased risk of death in the elderly with psychotic be- haviors associated with dementia. These deaths were cardiovascular related. In 2008 all typical antipsychotics were added to this warning. Therefore close monitoring is required when any of these medications are used. This presents a dilemma to the clinician. These medications can control behavior and promote safety, but there is a risk for untoward eects. Generally, the adage \"start low and go slow\" when using any medications in this population is particularly true. Other medications to treat depression, anxiety, and insomnia may be utilized. Be- cause depression and anxiety are especially common if the person is aware of the de- cline, these medications can be very helpful. Be aware that paradoxical reactions (drug has opposite eect than what it is intended for) sometimes occur in the elderly with anti-anxiety medications. Managing anxiety with these medications can be useful to reduce the patient's suering and disruptive behaviors. headache, GI upset Donepezil (Aricept) Insomnia, dizziness, headache, GI upset Rivastigmine Dizziness, headache, (Excelon) fatigue Galantamine Dizziness, headache, (Razadyne) GI upset Source: Adapted from Townsend (2012): Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing: Concepts of Care in Evidence-Based Practice, 7th ed.

An eective strategy is to crush the pills and put them in sweet foods like pudding.Neeb's Tip Close monitoring of side effects of all medications can be challeng- ing as the patient may not be able to tell you what he/she is experi- encing e.g., dry mouth, itching, constipation.Neeb's Tip Critical Thinking Question Your 72-year-old patient with advanced dementia has been screaming all night, calling for her mother. All attempts to console her are ineective. Every time someone walks by her room, her screaming increases. You have orders for several medications to control agitation, including haloperidol and lorazepam. Before administering one of these, what should you consider? Clinical Activity Monitor side eects of any medications your patient is taking. Your observation is most impor- tant as your patient may not be able to verbalize about symptoms.2993_Ch16_245-260 14/01/14 5:26 PM Page 252neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infec- tion as an example. Each of these forms of dementia has its own unique components in addition to core diagnostic features of dementia. Differential Diagnosis of Delirium and Dementia A new patient presenting with confusion and agitation can sometimes be misdiagnosed. Symptoms of delirium and dementia can seem similar, especially on rst meeting a patient. See Table 16-5 and Box 16-3 to dif- ferentiate between delirium and dementia and common factors leading to misdiagnosis.Nursing Care of Patients With Delirium and Dementia Common nursing diagnoses in patients with delirium and dementia include the following: Anxiety Injury, risk for Memory, impaired Self-care decit Sensory perception, disturbed Sleep pattern, disturbed Thought processes, disturbedCHAPTER 16|Neurocognitive Disorders: Delirium and Dementia 253 lTable 16-5 Characteristics of Delirium and Dementia Delirium Dementia Fluctuating levels of awareness and symptoms Sudden onset Clouding of consciousness Perceptual disturbances (hallucinations, illusions) Memory disturbance, more often for recent events Highly distractible Reversibility possible with treatmentSlow, insidious onset with less fluctuation of symptoms Deterioration of cognitive abilities Impaired long- and short-term memory (memory impairment always present) Personality changes May focus on one thing for a long time Often irreversible Source: Adapted from Gorman and Sultan (2008).

Several causes may occur simultaneously to bring about dementia. Delirium occurring in a patient with a dementia can exacerbate already existing symptoms. Health-care personnel may harbor unfounded beliefs that serious memory decits, confusion, and other progressive intellectual decits are a normal part of the aging process. Health-care personnel may harbor unfounded beliefs that confusion always indicates Alzheimer's disease in an older patient. Confusion and behavioral changes may be the rst signs of medical illness in the elderly. Head injuries and other conditions causing brain tissue trauma may present with symptoms similar to those of dementia. Confusion is an adverse reaction to many medications.

Table 8.1, page 131.2993_Ch16_245-260 14/01/14 5:26 PM Page 253General Nursing Interventions The nursing interventions for patients with either or both of these diagnoses are based on the patient's symptoms. 1.Collect data: Collect information on vital signs, medications used by the patient, circumstances immediately preceding symptoms, and any other information the patient or person who may be ac- companying the individual can provide. Note anything that is considered to be a change in the patient's condition. Ques- tion family/caregivers on interventions that have been useful in the past. 2.Stay calm: Be ready for anything. Patients with symptoms of delirium and/or dementia can be very changeable. No matter what the situation, nurses must diuse the situation calmly and return the situation to safety. It is very impor- tant to make every attempt to maintain the patient's dignity during periods of ex- citability. Due to memory decits, these patients can exhibit impulsive behaviors and labile emotions as they forget the context of the situation. The nurse re- maining calm will reinforce maintaining a calm environment.4.Use clear, simple verbal communication: Sensory overload is a common experi- ence for patients experiencing delirium and dementia. To avoid a behavioral \"short circuit,\" it is a good idea to use simple communication and activity in the room. Keep the area quiet. Keep curtains drawn or partially open; keep televisions and radios o or at a very low volume. The stimulation can be adjusted according to the patient's tolerance. Focus on one task at a time. Do not give the patient two to three instructions at the same time. 5.Allow time for patient to respond: The ability to function cognitively and physically is diminished when a person is in delirium or dementia. Nurses and other health-care workers must remem- ber to plan to allow more time for per- forming care. Patience is an important intervention. This can be frustrating for caregivers, but by following this plan the patient will have more oppor- tunities to remain independent and reduce his/her anxiety. This will make the nurse's job easier with better outcomes. 6.Use touch when appropriate: It is im - possible not to touch this group of patients. There is a danger for misinter- pretation of that touch, however. Peo- ple who have a threat to their ability to process and understand information may not remember the situation as it actually happened. They may have for- gotten the episode of incontinence and not understand why \"that nurse had to touch me there!\" Having a second person\u2014another nurse or a family member\u2014in the room can be a helpful protection for both the nurse and the patient. Documenting all actions and patient responses very carefully is also necessary. 7.Wandering: Patients in a state of delir- ium or dementia may wander. This is a major safety risk that frequently encourages nurses to request restraint orders from the physician. Restraints should only be used as last resort when alternative interventions are 254 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health A patient with early to moderate dementia may suer intense anxiety due to confusion and awareness of losing his/her memory. This can be the cause of agitation and paranoia.Neeb's Tip 3.Do not argue: Patients with dementia and/or delirium have cognitive impair- ment. They do not have the capacity to make rational decisions during the agi- tated episode. Attempting to model the desired behavior or simply waiting a few minutes and attempting the verbal in- struction again may prove to be successful techniques. These patients may no longer have the lters to control their behavior or act in a socially acceptable manner. Distraction can be helpful in some cases. Be aware that patients may use disruptive behaviors such as swearing, insulting others as a way to express frustration.2993_Ch16_245-260 14/01/14 5:26 PM Page 254unsuccessful. Interventions to use ear- lier include: Providing a safe environment where the patient can walk or pace Distracting patient to other activities Putting up large signs in the area re- minding patient of his room or areas o limits Using alarms on the patient or to o- limit areas (e.g., exit door to stairwell) Engaging family and volunteers to closely watch the patient's movements When the physician has ordered re- straints, the nursing responsibilities include careful observation and documentation of alternative interventions that have been tried. Physical restraints are dened as any physical method of restricting an individ- ual's freedom of movement, activity, or nor- mal access to his/her body and cannot be easily removed. For physical restraints, each state has guidelines for how often to check, release, and reposition or exercise the pa- tient. Assessing for signs of dermal ulcers and stiness of muscles helps to maintain skin integrity and full range of motion. Chemical restraints are dened as the use of a medication as a restriction to manage the patient's behavior or restrict the patient's freedom of movement, and are not a stan- dard treatment or dosage for the patient's condition. Again, each state may have guidelines on the use of chemical restraints. For chemical restraints, the nurse must doc- ument the eect of the medication and any possible side eects. Many medications have side eects, such as confusion, restless- ness, and forgetfulness, and may be coun- terproductive for people with delirium and dementia. Medications should not be used as a substitute for appropriate activities, programming, and personal interaction. 8.Assist with ADLs as appropriate to the situ- ation: The nurse will be doing as much for the patient physically as the individ- ual condition requires. For temporary delirium and early stages of dementia, the nurse may only have to use some ver- bal cues as to what the patient needs to do. For deeper delirium and later stages of dementia, performing total care for the patient may be necessary. Always maintain the patient's dignity and allow him or her to do as much independ- ently as able. 9.Provide adequate stimulation: It is as detrimental to understimulate people with cognitive disorders as it is to over- load them. The brain needs some en- couragement to activate. This will be a \"trial-and-error\" situation between the nurse and the patient, and it will be dierent for every patient. Some success has been made with music, pets, art, and physical therapies. 10.Maintain appropriate milieu: People liv- ing with irreversible, progressive demen- tia require special attention to the milieu. Acceptance is mandatory. In dementia, nurses should not emphasize \"reality orientation\" such as repeated attempts to ask or remind patient of his name, the year, and current location\u2014especially in later stages of the disease. Changes in the brain will not allow the memory to func- tion successfully and may, in fact, cause the patient to experience frustration, feel agitation, and increase acting-out behav- iors if \"reality orientation\" is emphasized. Reality orientation may be helpful in delirium and early stages of dementia where the patient gains a sense of com- fort from being reoriented, but with short-term memory gaps this may be helpful only for a brief time. Having old photos of the patient or familiar smells such as perfume or favorite foods in the environment can have a reassuring eect. Many dementia facilities ask families to bring in special personal items such as photos or memen- tos that can be housed in a \"memory box\" in the patient's room to provide a calming influence from familiar items. 11.Emotional support: The patient often ex- periences anxiety as he/she realizes loss of mental abilities. The person can become panicky when disoriented. A consistent, calm environment is important. Patients can also suer from depression, especially in early stages when the full impact of the progressive disease is made. Family caregivers also need much support as caring for this patient is exhausting. TheyCHAPTER 16|Neurocognitive Disorders: Delirium and Dementia 2552993_Ch16_245-260 14/01/14 5:26 PM Page 255often need assistance in identifying support groups and resources for addi- tional caregivers and facilities. See Table 16-6 for the nursing care plan of confused patients.256 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health lTable 16-6 Nursing Care Plan of the Confused Patient Nursing Data Collection Diagnosis Goal Interventions Evaluation Confused as to time, place Becomes agitated when eorts made to reorient patientPatients will have periods of calmness.Encourage family to provide familiar items in patient's room, e.g., old photos, mementos. Place a large sign on door to identify patient's room, bathroom. Spend time with patient to reminisce about an important event in the past. Play music or TV shows that are meaningful from patient's past. Judge whether reorient- ing patient regularly is eective. If it increases agitation, then avoid this. Distract the patient with concrete activities like sorting papers of the same color.Reduced episodes of agitationDisturbance in sensory perception Cultural Considerations The type of care the family wants for the dementia patient will be influenced by culture. In some cultures the family will maintain the patient in the home no mat- ter how dicult the care. Incorporating important cultural values in the discharge plan is essential. Language barriers can also add to com- plications in understanding the dementia patient's needs, especially if the patient is in a facility. It is important for these patients to have access to people who speak the same language and have similar cultural ex- periences to enhance reality orientation and correctly assess cognitive function. Family members must be provided information on being a caregiver and how to cope with the long- term emotional strain.Neeb's Tip Review agency policies on use of restraints. Be aware of alternatives to restraints that are useful with the patient.Neeb's TipTool Box |The 36-Hour Day: A Family Guide to Caring for Persons With Alzheimer Disease, Related Dementing Illnesses, and Memory Loss in Later Life (3rd Edition) by Mace and Rabin is a must read for family caregivers.

In the morning you nd him sound asleep at 10 a.m. What should be your plan for the day shift? The next day, this patient is very agitated and repeatedly insists on walking out the unit door. The MD leaves an order for soft restraints to prevent wandering. Before applying these, what interven- tions should you try? Key Concepts 1.Delirium is a frequent diagnosis in the acute hospital setting due to complex medical conditions, medication side eects, and sensory overload. 2.Delirium is usually reversible once the cause is identied; dementia is usually irreversible. 3.Alzheimer's disease is by far the most common form of dementia. 4.Alzheimer's disease is a terminal illness which has a tremendous impact on the patient's family and society. 5.Other causes of dementia include vascular insuciency, substance abuse, and Parkinson's disease. 6.Medications such as anti-anxiety and an- tipsychotics often have a side eect of confusion and should be chosen carefully in people with dementia. Medications are chosen to treat specic behaviors; they are not a substitute for more direct interventions. 7.Care of the dementia patient should focus on maintenance of safety, preven- tion of infection, and family support. CASE STUDY 1.What actions would you suggest the patient and her son institute at this time? 2.How would you dierentiate between dementia and depression? 3.What safety measures need to be implemented?Mrs. G is 84-year-old widow who lives alone. She has episodes of anxiety and paranoia in her apartment. She calls her son at odd hours, telling him that a neigh- bor is spying on her. Despite these episodes she seems to function normally and is able to care for herself. Her son reports that her memory seems to be getting poorer, and he notices that she leaves notes to herself around the apartment reminding her to lock the door, brush her teeth, or water the plants. He also notices that she looks as though she has lost weight recently, though she tells him she is eating well. He looks inher refrigerator and sees very little food. He asks her what she eats, and she says \"yogurt.\" She cannot think of anything else. She re- ports fear of using the stove so she only eats cold foods. He looks at her mail and notices a past due notice on her water bill. She says she is sure she paid that. He is get- ting concerned and takes her to a geriatric physician for an evaluation. Mrs. G has been a widow for 2 years. The physician does a complete assessment in the oce and orders an MRI. A diagnosis of early to moderate stage Alzheimer's disease is made. 2993_Ch16_245-260 14/01/14 5:26 PM Page 257REFERENCES Alzheimer's Association. (2013). Alzheimer's Dis- ease 2013 Facts (Vol. 2).

Today these include alco- hol, sedatives/hypnotics, narcotic analgesics, stimulants, hallucinogens, and cannabis as well as psychoactive drugs. Most of these categories of substances can be and are used legally and therapeutically. They all have the strong potential to be abused and to become addictive. These substances taken in excess activate the brain's reward system and can lead to neglecting normal activities in favor of seeking out this substance again and again. People use these substances for a variety of reasons: to relieve physical and emotional pain, relax, elevate mood, enhance socializa- tion, improve alertness, and alter perceptions of reality. Alcohol and caeine are probably the most used socially acceptable substances. Tobacco was also part of that group, but in 261CHAPTER17 Substance Use and Addictive Disorders Learning Objectives 1.Describe substance use disorder and how it impacts society. 2.Dene co-dependency. 3.

Identify nursing interventions for patients with addictive disorders.Key Terms Addiction Alcohol abuse Alcohol dependence Alcoholism Binge drinking Co-dependency Co-occurring disorder Detoxication Dysfunctional Psychoactive drugs Substance abuse Substance dependence Tolerance Withdrawal recent years its use has become much less ac- ceptable in U.S. society (Fig. 17-1). Substance abuse is a major health problem in the United States. Overall 14.6% of the population has had a substance abuse dis- order at some time in their lives (Kessler, Berglund et al., 2005). Substance abuse con- tributes to higher health-care costs, signicant disability, and suicide attempts (Cook & Alegr\u00eda, 2011). The National Survey on Drug Abuse and Health conducts an annual survey of Americans' use of alcohol and other sub- stances and provides the following data from 2011. 8.7% of Americans age 12 or older were current (past month) illicit drug users, meaning they had used an illicit drug during the month prior to the survey in- terview. Illicit drugs include marijuana/ hashish, cocaine (including crack), remains the most widely used illegal drug. An estimated 20.6 million persons (8% of the population age 12 or older) were classied with substance dependence or abuse in the past year based on criteria specied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV-TR). Of these, 2.6 million were classied with dependence or abuse of both alcohol and illicit drugs, 3.9 million had dependence or abuse of illicit drugs but not alcohol, and 14.1 million had dependence or abuse of alcohol but not illicit drugs. Generally, substance use becomes a prob- lem when it: 1.Interferes with normal functioning 2.Continues despite negative consequences 3.Hurts others Substance abuse and substance depen - dence have been traditionally separated as two distinct diagnoses. Because these two desig- nations are sometimes confusing and dicult to dierentiate, the DSM-5 (2013) has com- bined abuse and dependence into substance use disorder with a graded clinical severity of mild, moderate, and severe. In addition to substance use disorder, there are diagnostic categories for substance-induced intoxication and withdrawal. Each category has specic criteria to be met to be given the diagnosis for each substance. At least two criteria are re- quired to make a diagnosis for a particular substance use disorder. However because the terms \"abuse\" and \"dependence\" are so com- mon in today's culture, they will still be used throughout this chapter along with substance use disorder. People with psychiatric disorders com- monly abuse many drugs and alcohol as a way to self-medicate to reduce feelings of anxiety, in- somnia, depression, loneliness, rapid thoughts, frightening hallucinations, and other distressing symptoms. Commonly referred to as a co- occurring disorder (also called dual diagnosis), this form of substance use disorder adds additional complications to the psychiatric diagnosis in terms of daily management, treat- ment, and recovery. Co-occurring disorders are the rule rather than exception when working with a patient with a psychiatric disorder. Co-occurring disorders can start with self- medicating to treat symptoms of a psychiatric diagnosis, or substance abuse can be the initial diagnosis that leads to other psychiatric disor- ders as a complication. See Figures 17-2 and 17-3 on pages 263 and 264. Outcomes for treatment are more eective when the sub- stance use treatment is integrated into the treat- ment for the psychiatric disorder (Clark, 2012). Health-care professionals are not immune to problems with alcohol and drugs. In fact, they tend to abuse alcohol or prescribed drugs. Since they do not t the image of a262 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Figure 17-1 As this poster says, nicotine is an addiction, and it can be the most dicult one to overcome.

Many states have developed drug diversion pro- grams to provide condential treatment and rehabilitation. CHAPTER 17|Substance Use and Addictive Disorders 263 Critical Thinking Question You are working in an outpatient mental health clinic. A new patient with a long history of schizo- phrenia tells you he needs to leave the clinic for an hour to meet someone who gives him \"special medicines\" that he calls herbs to help him sleep. What concerns would you have? What action would you take? All psychiatric patients should be screened for substance abuse disorders.Neeb's Tip Classroom Activity Movies that address substance abuse include Days of Wine and Roses, Lost Weekend, I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can, 28 Days, and Flight. Obtain information on how your state addresses substance abuse in nurses. Mental disorder such as psychosis, depressionFurther declineSubstance abuse disorderSubstance in co-occurring disorders.Some of the characteristics of progressive substance use disorder include (American Psychiatric Association, 2000, 2013): A need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication or desired eect (tolerance) Markedly diminished eect with contin- ued use of the same amount of the sub- stance (tolerance) There is a characteristic withdrawal syn- drome for the substance The same (or a closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms (e.g., alcohol and tranquilizers to sleep) The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended (analgesics originally used for pain relief then continued when source of pain resolved) There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful eort to cut down or control substance use A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance (e.g., vis- iting multiple doctors or driving long dis- tances to a source), in use of the substance, or to recover from its eects Important social, occupational, or recre- ational activities are given up or reduced because of substance use (e.g., quitting school, giving up a favorite sport) Cultural Considerations Substance abuse crosses all cultures and ethnic groups. Some groups are known to have a higher incidence that may reflect genetic risk and/or cultural patterns. For example, Native Americans have a high rate of alcoholism. Genetic factors that predispose them to poor metabolism of alcohol as well as other factors such as unemployment and poverty are contribu- tors. Asians have a lower rate of substance abuse. Genetic intolerance for alcohol creating an unpleasant sensation may be a factor in the lower incidence of alcoholism (Townsend, 2012).2993_Ch17_261-286 14/01/14 5:26 PM Page 263The substance use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recur- rent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exac- erbated by the substance (e.g., current cocaine use despite recognition of cocaine- induced depression, or continued drink- ing despite recognition that an ulcer was made worse by alcohol consumption) Failure to fulll major role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences or poor work performance re- lated to substance use; substance-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions from school; neglect of children or household) Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by substance use) Recurrent substance-related legal prob- lems (e.g., arrests for substance-related disorderly conduct) Continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interper- sonal problems caused or exacerbated by the eects of the substance (e.g., argu- ments with spouse about consequences of intoxication, physical ghts) Alcohol As the most commonly abused substance worldwide, alcohol is readily available in most cultures and is often included in importantoccasions and religious ceremonies. Eight per- cent of Americans are dependent on alcohol at any one time (Kessler, Berglund et al., 2005). It is quickly absorbed in the body with initial eects of intoxication producing relaxation, euphoria, and loss of inhibition. The legal blood level of intoxication is 0.08- 0.10 g/dL in most states (known as blood alcohol level). Higher levels of alcohol pro- duce the central nervous system depressant qualities that lead to staggering gait, labile emotions, incoherent speech, poor judgment, and belligerent/aggressiv e behavior, and even- tually can lead to coma and respiratory depres- sion in extremely high levels (greater than 0.4 g/dL). Alcohol content varies with the type of beverage. The same amount of alcohol is present in: 12 ounces of most beers 5 ounces of wine 1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits such as whiskey or vodka 264 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health For most adults, low risk alcohol use \u2014up to fourteen drinks per week for men and seven drinks per week for women and older people\u2014causes few, if any, problems (National Insti- tute of Alcohol Abuse and Alco- holism \"Rethinking Drinking\").Neeb's Tip Alcoholism is dened as a chronic illness characterized by compulsive and uncontrolled consumption of alcoholic beverages usually to the detriment of the drinker's health, personal relationships, and social standing. Addiction to alcohol has been referred to as alcohol de- pendence, alcohol abuse, and now alcohol use disorder. Given the same amount of alcohol, women have higher blood alcohol concentrations than men, even with size taken into consideration. Dierences in fat and body water content lead to women being more prone to long-term ef- fects of heavy alcohol use (Fig. 17-4) (National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism). Early signs of serious problems with alco- hol use in men and women can include: Drinking in secret Drinking rst thing after waking upSelf- medication to function Increasing alcohol to sleepWorsening depressionWorsening depressionAlcoholism Figure 17-3 An example of the cycle of decline in co-occurring disorders.2993_Ch17_261-286 14/01/14 5:26 PM Page 264Gulping the rst drink Preoccupation with alcohol Onset of blackouts (lapses in memory re- sulting from persistent heavy drinking) In 2011, nearly one-quarter (23.1%) of persons aged 12 or older participated in binge drinking (National Survey on Drug Use and Health by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2011). Binge drinking is dened as having ve or more drinks (four drinks for women) on the same occasion on at least one day. Binge drinking can lead to serious health consequences from alcohol poisoning when alcohol reaches toxic levels, as well as risky behaviors when under its influence.Impact on the Family Family members and friends often develop protective behaviors, sometimes called co- dependency or enabling to control, hide, or deny the alcoholic's behavior to maintain a sense of normalcy for the family. These can include nding excuses for the drinker's alco- hol use, covering up the drinker's unacceptable behavior, and self-blame for the drinking. Co- dependency may be seen with use of other substances besides alcohol. Alcoholism is a family disease. More than half of all adults have a family history of alcoholism or problem drinking, and one in four children grow up in a home where some- one drinks too much (National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism).CHAPTER 17|Substance Use and Addictive Disorders 265 Figure 17-4 The use\u2014and abuse\u2014of alcohol occurs in person of all ages, races, and cultural backgrounds, and in women as well as men. (Courtesy of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.) Binge drinking in college age adults may be seen as a rite of passage for many, but it can lead to serious damage and even death. Students and parents need to be advised of the eects of toxic levels of alcohol. Many colleges now provide specic information to students about the risk of alcohol poisoning from binge drinking.Neeb's Tip Any alcohol use in children and teens is a cause for concern. They may access alcohol from their homes or homes of acquaintances, at parties, or by buying it with fake identification or from older friends. Seeing their parents drink- ing may give a double message to children or teens who are eager to be grown up. Experimenting with alcohol by adolescents is common, and it is difficult to know which ones will move to a lifetime of struggles with alcohol. A high per- centage of adult alcoholics started drinking as teenagers, so any sign of alcohol use by a child or teen must be addressed and needs parental intervention.Neeb's Tip Critical Thinking Question Your patient is a 16-year-old girl admitted from the ER with moderate injuries from a car accident. She was the driver. The other teens in the car were also injured. The patient is awake and tells you that her parents cannot know that she had had a \"couple of drinks\" at a party just prior to driving her friends home. How would you respond? Should the parents be told? Does that make you an enabler if you choose not to share this?2993_Ch17_261-286 14/01/14 5:26 PM Page 265Alcohol's Impact on Health Alcoholism is the third leading cause of preventable death in the United States (Kessler, Berglund et al., 2005; Kessler, Demler et al., 2005). It can become a chronic medical illness. Heavy drinking contributes to heart disease, some cancers, liver failure, and stroke as it aects most organs in the body. It leads to more complications in the presence of di- abetes. It also contributes to countless trac accidents, falls, domestic violence, suicides, participating in risky activities, industrial accidents, and other unsafe activities as judg- ment is impaired. Alcohol abuse is often unrecognized and undertreated in the over 65 age group. Whether a lifelong pattern or a new coping mechanism in facing problems, heavy drinking can be confused with demen- tia, mask depression, and contribute to falls or res in the home. Alcohol can also contribute to adverse reactions to many medications. Fetal alcohol syndrome includes physical, mental, and/or learning disabilities in a child exposed to alcohol in utero. Etiology of Alcohol Abuse Alcoholism runs in families. Biological o- spring of alcoholic parents have a signicantly greater incidence of alcoholism than ospring of non-alcoholic parents. This supports the genetic theories. The genes a person inherits partially explain this pattern, but lifestyle is also a factor. Currently, researchers are working to discover the actual genes that put people at risk for alcoholism. The link be- tween depression and alcoholism also suggests biological factors. These facts support the view of alcoholism as a disease. Recent devel- opments in medications to treat alcoholism demonstrate the role of biological cravings to induce a sense of well-being (see Pharmacol- ogy Corner for Alcohol Abuse). Disturbance in neural pathways that establish a biological craving to induce well-being is one of the the- ories. Social factors, stress, and how readily available alcohol is also are factors that may increase the risk for alcoholism. Growing up in a home where alcohol is used as a major coping mechanism for stress also puts a per- son at risk. But, just because alcoholism tends to run in families does not mean that a child of an alcoholic parent will automatically be- come an alcoholic too. Some people develop alcoholism even though no one in their fam- ily has a drinking problem. Alcohol Withdrawal It is estimated that about 25% of admissions to the acute hospital are alcohol related (National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism). Nurses will see patients who are known alcoholics and those where the diag- nosis is not known. Awareness of the signs of alcohol withdrawal is essential for all nurses. Signs include: Autonomic hyperactivity (high blood pressure, tachycardia, fever) Hand tremor Insomnia Nausea and/or vomiting Anxiety T ransient visual, tactile, or auditory hallu- cinations or illusions Early signs of delirium Grand mal seizures266 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Tool Box |Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACOA) has support groups for people who grew up in a dysfunctional family related to alcoholism: www.adultchildren.org/ Tool Box |The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has information on re- search and the current picture of alcohol use in the United States. http://niaaa.nih.gov/ Long-term alcohol abuse can con- tribute to a form of dementia in later life.Neeb's Tip Tool Box |Use the CAGE questionnaire as a four-question tool to identify problems with alcohol use.

Analgesics and recovery from anes- thesia can precipitate a withdrawal reaction. It may look like a classic delirium. Screening patients about alcohol use is increasingly common as part of the routine admission assessment in the general hospital. Treatment of Alcoholism Perhaps the single most eective treatment for alcoholism is Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). AA is a nationwide organization begun in 1935 by two alcoholic men who bonded and vowed to support each other through recov- ery. AA has groups in most communities and internationally. It is run by alcoholics, but there is no leader in the group. One of the main tenets of AA is anonymity. People identify themselves by rst names only. Someone usually starts the topic or introduc- tions or asks an opening question, but the group runs itself. It is based on twelve steps, and frequently one step is discussed each CHAPTER 17|Substance Use and Addictive Disorders 267 The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (2012) recommends that pri- mary care providers screen for alco- hol abuse in all adults and pregnant women to identify problem drinkers earlier.Neeb's Tip Questions that can be asked routinely on admission to identify patients at risk for with- drawal include: How often do you drink alcohol? How much do you usually drink? When was the last time you used alcohol or any drug? Have you had any problems because of drinking or drug use? The routine admission questions noted above can also be used to screen for use of other substances.Neeb's Tip Withdrawal symptoms are generally most intense on the second day of abstinence. The physician can order a detoxication regimen that will prevent or reduce the alcohol- induced delirium. Withdrawal from alcohol is very uncomfortable but generally not life threatening. Generally, withdrawal is managed with longer acting CNS depressants such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which have anticonvulsant actions and are relatively safe. These are administered routinely and tapered down over several days. Fluids, vitamins, and electrolyte replacement are also part of the treatment plan. Withdrawal can induce an extreme form of delirium sometimes referred to as delirium tremens or \"DTs,\" evidenced by impaired consciousness and memory as well as halluci- nations and severe tremors. Classroom Activity Role-play with classmates how to ask patients about their alcohol and drug use. Clinical Activity Any patient who indicates a history of problems with alcohol should be monitored for withdrawal. Tool Box |The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, known popularly at CIWA-Ar, is a useful tool used by many hospitals to monitor patients at risk for with- drawal syndrome. Available at Sullivan, J. T., et al. (1989). Assessment of alcohol withdrawal: The revised Clinical Institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol scale.

Until now, her recovery has been routine. She calls you to her bedside and looks anxious and tremulous. She tells you that a glass of wine would help make her more comfortable. What would you do? An individual desperate for alcohol may take alcohol-based medications like cough syrup to control withdrawal.Neeb's Tip2993_Ch17_261-286 14/01/14 5:26 PM Page 267week or on a designated week per month. AA meetings are closed\u2014that is, nobody except the alcoholics themselves are allowed to attend. There is usually a group that has an open meet- ing monthly or quarterly. If the meeting is listed as open, any interested person may attend. There are corresponding groups for families of the alcoholic (Al-Anon) and a special group for teenagers (Alateen). Adult Children of Al- coholics (ACoA) is a branch of AA formed for people who are now adults but grew up in an alcoholic home and were not able to get help at the time. These groups all follow a similar model. Table 17-1 lists the twelve steps of AA (Alcoholics Anonymous, 1981). Other twelve- step groups serving other dependency needs, including narcotics, cocaine, and gambling, have modeled themselves after the AA model.One of the slogans of AA is \"One Day at a Time.\" Members of AA believe that they are always in a state of recovery, not that they have recovered. Recovery from alcoholism is a process. With very few exceptions, an alcoholic who is recovering cannot ever have another drink, or he or she risks returning to the abusive patterns. Other forms of treatment often include family therapy, short-term hospitalization for detoxication, and individual and group ther- apy to learn new coping mechanisms. Life without alcohol presents many challenges to268 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health lTable 17-1 The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous The Twelve Steps of Alcoholics The Twelve Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous Anonymous 1.We admitted we were powerless over alcohol\u2014that our lives had become unmanageable. 2.Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. 3.Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we under- stood Him. 4.Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. 5.Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. 6.Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character. 7.Humbly asked Him to remove our short- comings. 8.Made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all.1.Our common welfare should come rst; per- sonal recovery depends upon A.A. unity. 2.For our group purpose, there is but one ultimate authority\u2014a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience.

See Pharmacology Corner under Alcohol. Critical Thinking Question Your friend stopped drinking about one year ago after she was in a car accident in which she was driving impaired with her three-year-old in the car. She has been attending AA regularly. She is now going through a divorce and tells you she is so stressed and depressed that she has no more energy to get to the AA meetings. What would be your concerns? How can you help her? Critical Thinking Question Your 35-year-old patient is being treated for alcohol- related liver disease. He tells you he stopped drinking last month but is worried about his relationship with his anc\u00e9e, who is a heavy drinker. What would be your concerns? What suggestions can you make? Pharmacology Corner Three drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat alcoholism. Many other approaches ar e being researched. 1. Disulram (Antabuse) was the rst medicine approved for the treatment of alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. It works by causing a severe adverse re- action when someone taking the med- ication consumes alcohol. This reaction includes palpitations, nausea and vom- iting, severe headache, and shortness of breath with exposure to any alcohol. 2.Naltrexone is sold under the brand names Revia and Depade. An extended- release form of naltrexone is marketed under the trade name Vivitrol. These drugs works by blocking the \"high\" that people experience when they drink alcohol or take opioids like Continued2993_Ch17_261-286 14/01/14 5:27 PM Page 269270 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Pharmacology Corner\u2014 cont'd heroin and cocaine so it blocks the \"reward\" when taking a drink or the opioid. 3.Acamprosate (Campral) works by reduc- ing the cravings for alcohol for some- one who is in recovery. See Table 17-2 for medications com- monly used to manage withdrawal. Critical Thinking Question Your 50-year-old patient on Antabuse tells you he is thinking of having a drink to test his response when he goes out on pass. What would you ad- vise this patient? What actions should you take after hearing this information? Any patient on Antabuse must be advised to avoid taking any sub- stance with an alcohol base, includ- ing cough syrups and mouthwashes. The patient should carry information so emergency personnel know this information.Neeb's Tip lTable 17-2 Commonly Used Medications for Withdrawal Management of Alcohol and Other Substances Alcohol Withdrawal Chlordiazepoxide (Librium) Diazepam (Valium) Oxazepam as (Librium) Haloperidol (Haldol) Other Substances There are a wide variety of substances that are abused. See Table 17-3 for a summary of the eects of commonly abused substances. Signs and symptoms of substance use disorders vary as to the type of drug. Poly-drug use is com- mon and can create a confusing clinical pic- ture. The individual may use one drug to counteract or enhance the eects of the rst drug. Drugs are often combined with alcohol. For example, cocaine users commonly use alcohol to get to sleep or calm down. Many drug and alcohol combinations have a syner- gistic eect that can be life threatening. Pat- terns of drug use vary as new substances are discovered. Nurses should be aware of newer drugs that may be used by their patient pop- ulation. For example, in some communitiesmethamphetamines has been a problem as are \"club drugs,\" including ecstasy, ketamine, and rohypnol (Fig. 17-5). Club drugs are short-acting benzodiazepines that are slipped into an alcoholic drink, causing the unsus- pecting victim to become incapacitated and unable to resist a sexual assault. The form of methamphetamine known as crystal meth is produced illegally from ephedrine and creates a highly addictive stimulant that is usually smoked. A new drug referred to as \"bath salt\" has recently been receiving national at- tention. This stimulant can produce a para- noia reaction. DSM-5 now categorizes each substance by substance-induced intoxication and with- drawal disorders. Each disorder has its own criteria for diagnosing based on the specic substance used.

Use of opioid drugs for nonmedical use is a growing problem. This can include the use of pain medication to achieve a high or to relax rather than for physical pain relief. Desperate actions such as stealing drugs from family/ friends, forging prescriptions, and doctor shop- ping are signs that the person needs help. Peo- ple with chronic pain who regularly take analgesics may be at increased risk to misuse prescribed analgesic at times of stress, new onset of more medical problems, and mental health issues. They need to be educated on the appropriate use of these medications and monitored closely (Pergolizzi et al., 2012). Older adults are more likely to abuse prescrip- tion tranquilizers, sedatives, and analgesics. Substance Use in Children and Teens Children and teens can also be at risk for substance disorders. The use of inhalants, including household items such as hair spray and aerosol whipped cream, is most common in children. These easily obtained substances can contribute to sudden changes in behavior. Cough syrups and prescription drugs from parents are other sources for children and teens. Signs of substance use in children and teens can include: Change in functioning at school Loss of interest in sportsChange in sleep patterns Increased isolation Irritability Mood swings Lifelong struggles with substance use often begin in childhood and adolescence. Younger brains are thought to be more vulnerable to the addiction cycle. Therefore, intervention with young people is essential to prevent ad- diction. Children and teens are still develop- ing judgment and decision-making skills, so they may be swayed to try things as part of peer pressure or to self-medicate. 276 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Figure 17-5 \"Homemade\" methamphetamine tablets. ( Courtesy of Drug Enforcement Agency, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.) Critical Thinking Question Your 15-year-old nephew has been arrested for pos- session of a prescription analgesic that he stole from a friend's parent's medicine cabinet. You had noticed that recently he had more mood swings than usual, had been doing poorly in school, and was increas- ingly irritable. What other signs would you look for that he is using these drugs? What concerns would you have for his future? Tool Box |The Drug Abuse Screening Tool, known as DAST, is used in some settings. The 20-question self-screening tool is available at www.integration.samhsa.gov/clinical- practice/screening-tools Etiology of Substance Use Disorders The causes of substance use disorders are sim- ilar to those of alcohol abuse, but with the wide variety of drugs abused, there are some dierences. Biological theories look at the role of specic brain dysfunction and view addic- tion as a brain disease. A drug will stimulate a specic brain pathway that includes an altered state and brain changes leading to craving this drug again. Cocaine has been studied the most, and it is believed that cocaine abusers have a deciency of dopamine and norepinephrine that creates more craving. Other mind-altering drugs may be influenced by dierent pathways.2993_Ch17_261-286 14/01/14 5:27 PM Page 276Psychological factors include use of drugs to relieve feelings of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Sociocultural theories look at the impact of peer group and culture on the use of specic drugs. Treatment of Substance Use Disorders As with alcoholism, the twelve-step program provides an important treatment and support for the individual with substance abuse. The same philosophy of acknowledging one's powerlessness over a substance and the im- portance of group support are the foundation of these programs. In addition, some people benet from in- patient drug rehabilitation programs, which can include detoxication depending on the drug. Family therapy, individual psychother- apy, peer counseling with former addicts, and group therapy can also be helpful in many cases. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) can also be useful. This approach is a short-term therapy that emphasizes learning the connec- tion between stressors and symptoms, teach- ing new coping skills, and challenging distorted thinking. Most substance abuse pro- grams involve the family in the treatment plan. Heroin addiction may be treated with methadone maintenance when a long-acting opioid is taken daily to avoid the withdrawal symptoms without the high from taking other opioids. See the Pharmacology Corner for other medications used to treat addictions and withdrawal. It is now commonplace for employers to re- quest a drug screening of a urine or hair sam- ple as a condition of employment or as a routine test while employed. Many companies have struggled with drug abuse with their em- ployees and have found this to be a deterrent. In the hospital setting, awareness of a pa- tient's past substance abuse history is important information to prevent/control withdrawal syn- dromes. In addition, a recovering substance abuser may be hesitant to take analgesics or tranquilizers for fear of returning to a past lifestyle. It is important to work with the patient to address these fears and identify alternative interventions if possible. People who take drugs intravenously are at risk of HIV, sexually transmitted diseases, and hepatitis from infected needles. T reatment for substance abuse should include a medical work-up for these potential problems as well as education on prevention.CHAPTER 17|Substance Use and Addictive Disorders 277 Cultural Considerations Disparities in availability of treatment for substance-related disorders for some eth- nic groups and those of lower socioeco- nomic status have led to greater problems in some communities (Cook & Alegr\u00eda, 2011). Clinical Activity Review the medical record for what substances your patient was abusing, the last time they were used, and the potential complications. Your patient who is an IV drug abuser should be screened for HIV, sexually transmitted diseases, and hepatitis. Education may need to be provided on prevention of these diseases. Classroom Activity Identify resources for drug abusers in your community, such as methadone maintenance programs and halfway houses for recovering addicts. Critical Thinking Question You work at a methadone clinic and see the same patients daily for their medication dose. You notice that one patient arrives disheveled with slurred speech. What actions should you take? Critical Thinking Question You are asked to submit a urine test as a condition of employment for a new job at a local hospital. What is your response to this request? What are the pros and cons of this for employer and employee?2993_Ch17_261-286 14/01/14 5:27 PM Page 277Nursing Care of Patients With Substance Use Disorders (Including Alcohol) Common nursing diagnoses in patients with substance-related disorders include the following: Coping, ineective Denial, ineective278 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Pharmacology Corner A variety of medications are used in the treatment of substance use disorders. Phar- macology can be used in some cases to re- place the illicit substance, as in methadone (see below), or to reduce the drug cravings by interacting with the receptor system in the brain aected by the substance. Exam- ples include buprenorphine and naloxone for opioid addiction. These substances also reduce the physical signs of withdrawal. Medications are used in detoxication programs for many drugs, including opioids, barbiturates, sedatives, and tranquilizers. They are used to control withdrawal symptoms and discourage continued use of the abused sub- stance. Most are used for only short periods until withdrawal is complete; however, in some cases, they may be used for longer peri- ods to control cravings for the drug. Methadone, a synthetic narcotic that resem- bles morphine and heroin but does not pro- duce the euphoric eects, is used daily on a long-term basis to treat heroin addiction. Both physical and psychological dependence are maintained on methadone, but the euphoric eects of heroin are blocked. Patients usually make daily trips to a methadone clinic to ob- tain the drug. Buprenorphine, an opioid with agonist and antagonist action, has been used as an alternative to methadone. Naltrexone also reduces the euphoric sensation from narcotics, and clonidine decreases discomfort during narcotic withdrawal. The newest treatment uses phine and naloxone). Addiction specialists must be certied to prescribe this regimen. Patients on this medication must be monitored closely if they have conditions that require use of analgesics. Administering analgesics could precipitate a withdrawal syndrome. Benzodiazepines and sedative withdrawal is more risky because of the risk for seizures and delirium. Tapering the dose of the iden- tied or similar drug, along with anticon- vulsants and antidepressants, is usually used. Withdrawal from stimulants may require use of tranquilizers and antidepressants. Bupropion and varenicline (Chantix) work in combination with behavioral treatmentsto help with nicotine withdrawal in addition to nicotine replacement in the form of lozenges or patches. Herb and plant products to treat distress- ing symptoms may be helpful and include chamomile, valerian, kava kava, and St. John's wort. The last is contraindicated if the pa- tient is taking antidepressants, narcotics, or amphetamines. Commonly used medications to treat withdrawal are covered in Table 17-2. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, known popularly at CIWA-AR, is also a use- ful tool used by many hospitals to monitor patients at risk for with- drawal syndromes from opioids and benzodiazepines.Neeb's Tip Clinical Activity Review agency policy on the management of drug withdrawal regimens. Identify coping mechanisms your substance abusing patient uses to cope with stress now that he/she is not using. Monitor for potential complications during detoxication. Critical Thinking Question Your 19-year-old patient is admitted for surgery after he broke his ankle in a car accident. His sister condes in you that he has been taking frequent doses of the tranquilizer lorazepam that he was taking from his mother's prescription. He has asked her to bring these to the hospital. The patient's sis- ter has them but now wonders if that is the right thing to do. What concerns would you have about this drug? What action should you take?2993_Ch17_261-286 14/01/14 5:27 PM Page 278Family coping: compromised Injury, risk for Sleep pattern, disturbed Thought processes, disturbed Violence, risk for People who abuse drugs, alcohol, and other substances often use similar coping mechanisms to deal with their problems.

Blames others for his or her drinking and substance abuse. Justies intolerable behavior by giving plausible excuses. Avoids conflict by reducing the impact of the behavior. Plays one person against another in order to get one's way or cover up or avoid a problem. Maintains a sense of superi- ority and irresponsibility particularly evident when intoxicated.\"I only have two drinks a day; I could stop any time.\" Refuses to admit drug problems that are obvious to others. Family may participate in denial by covering up the problems created by the abuser. Avoids taking responsibility for own unacceptable behavior. \"My brother is the one with the problem. He drinks more than I do.\" \"I'd stop if everyone would leave me alone.\" Excuses reinforce denial. \"My kids are always in trouble. They make me take these pills\" \"I only drink beer.\" Places less value on the behavior and the impact of the problem. \"You worry too much.\" \"I'm not hurting anyone.\" Convinces one or two people that he or she will improve if they will help. If he or she fails, it is the fault of the helper. Lacks concern for others' feelings.General Nursing Interventions Caring for patients with a variety of substance use disorders requires patience, knowledge, teamwork, and compassion. These patients present many challenges as there can be many complications related to the substance itself and/or the withdrawal process. In addition, the same coping mechanisms the patient has used for years to hide the addiction and problems it created are often still in use. These can include denial, manipulative behavior, and rationaliza- tion. The nurse may be in a role of limit setter and rule enforcer, which can be challenging.2993_Ch17_261-286 14/01/14 5:27 PM Page 279280 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health lTable 17-5 Problems With Substance Abuse: Symptoms and Nursing Interventions Types Symptoms Nursing Interventions Alcohol Abuse Inability to cut down or stop using Daily use common Binges that last 2 days or more Blackouts, which increase Impaired social function May use drugs in addition to alcohol to manage symptoms Increase in alcohol tolerance Drinking in \"secret\" Preoccupation with alcohol Gulping rst drink Inability to discuss problems Loss of control Rationalization of drinking Failure in eorts to control drinking Grandiose and aggressive behavior Trouble with family, employer Self-pity Loss of outside interests Unreasonable resentment Neglecting food Tremors (hands) Morning drinking Prolonged intoxication Physical and moral deterioration Impaired thinkingCommunicate honestly Assist patient in identifying thoughts and feelings Convey acceptance of individual Challenge rationalizations or denial with reality Encourage participation in support groups and maintain consistency with new behaviors learned in group Confront use of maladaptive defense mechanism Support any acknowledgement of the abuse Support and give positive reinforcement of progress Set rm limits as needed Provide information about substance abuse, causes, and treatment Monitor for withdrawal syndromes and complications from substance abuse Support of drug/alcohol-free lifestyle Recognize that patient may have setbacks with drinking but encourage to restart treatment Avoid any enabling of patient's bad behavior Patients with a substance abuse history often refuse analgesics for fear this will lead to abusing the substance again. Working with the patient to try alter- nate methods of pain control as well as appropriate ordering of analgesics by the physician (e.g., use of long-acting opioids rather than injectable to re- duce the high) can be helpful.Neeb's Tip Recognize that maintaining sobriety or abstinence from drugs or alcohol is a lifelong process. During periods of stress or illness, the urge to use these substances can increase. The patient needs added supports at these timesNeeb's Tip People with a drug abuse past may have learned to use charm and ma- nipulation to get the drugs they are seeking. Family, friends, and health- care providers may have diculty trusting them in recovery because of being taken advantage of in the past.Neeb's TipThe nurse may also be faced with patients who are intoxicated on the substance. This can mean dealing with oensive, abusive behaviors that require maintenance of safety for all in- volved as well as limit setting. See Table 17-5 for specic interventions related to alcohol and drug abuse disorders.2993_Ch17_261-286 14/01/14 5:27 PM Page 280CHAPTER 17|Substance Use and Addictive Disorders 281 lTable 17-5 Problems With Substance Abuse: Symptoms and Nursing Interventions\u2014cont'd Types Symptoms Nursing Interventions Substance Use Co-dependenceFree-floating anxiety Obsession with drinking Constant use of alibis Similar to alcohol abuse with addition of: Red, watery eyes Runny nose Hostility Paranoia Needle tracks on arms or legs Erratic, unpredictable behavior Risky behaviors including stealing, lying to obtain drug May use alcohol too to self-medicate for symptoms Other symptoms depending on drug being used Signicant others beginning to lose their own sense of identity and purpose, existing solely for the abuser Actions of signicant others taking away opportunity for user to take responsibility for his or her own actions Lowered self-esteem Taking part in actions that are self-destructive and reinforce drug seeker's/drinker's problemsSee \"Alcohol Abuse\" Encourage patient to be tested for HIV if drug use included use of needles Monitor drug testing if ordered Be aware of attempts to manipu- late you Encourage participation in assertiveness classes Promote self-care and problem solving Encourage attendance at support groups Challenge rationalizations/denial about substance abuser Help person identify self- destructive patterns Encourage activities to promote self-esteem and individuality Denial is a powerful coping mech- anism common in alcohol and substance use disorders that gets reinforced by the eects of the sub- stance. Patients may minimize the eects of the substance abuse even when presented with objective data like a blood alcohol level or toxicol- ogy screen. Look for slightest indica- tion of insight and emphasize that rather than support the denial.Neeb's Tip Critical Thinking Question Your 45-year-old patient is admitted to the hospital with multiple injuries that she states she sustained in a fall at home. When the husband of the patient arrives, he smells of alcohol, is belligerent, and de- mands his wife be released. After security asks him to leave, the wife tells you that he has never acted like this before and she is sorry she upset him by telling him their son acted out in school. She de- nies he hurt her and says that she tripped down the stairs because she left some of the younger son's toys there. You wonder if the wife is covering up her husband's drinking problem as an enabler. What would you consider as possible nursing diag- noses for this patient? If the husband comes back, what actions should you consider?The nursing care plan for a patient abusing alcohol is provided in Table 17-6.2993_Ch17_261-286 14/01/14 5:27 PM Page 281282 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health lTable 17-6 Nursing Care Plan for Patients Abusing Alcohol Assessment/ Nursing Interventions/ Evaluation Data Collection Diagnosis Plan/Goal Nursing Actions Criteria History of heavy drinking Minimizes negative eects of drinking Denies concern about recent erratic behavior Blames his spouse for recent argumentIneective denialPatient acknowledges need for help Patient attends AA meeting Patient shares one emotionDemonstrate acceptance by avoiding criticism or judgment of his behavior Identify recent inconsistencies in his behavior Help patient identify feelings/events that lead to recent binge Foster problem solving to identify new ways to cope with stress Provide information about Alcoholics Anonymous Set limits on manipulative behavior Promote taking responsibility for hurting spouse's feelingsAcknowledges drinking is out of control Asks for help Key Concepts 1.Substance abuse and dependence are growing disorders in the United States with wide ranging impacts on health, safety, and family life. 2.Poly-drug use is common as the person tries to self-medicate to decrease discom- forts from another drug. This contributes to more complications and possible syner- gistic eects that can be life-threatening. 3.Dependency on a substance occurs when one is unable to control its use, even while knowing that it interferes with normal functioning and more of the substance is required to produce the desired eects. 4.The presence of substance abuse with a psychiatric disorder is called a co-occurring disorder or dual diagnosis. It is commonly seen in the psychiatric population and needs to be included in the screening. 5.Co-dependency is often seen in family and friends of substance abusers as they try to help the person by covering up or enabling addictive behaviors. 6.Longer-acting tranquilizers are used as the initial treatment to detoxify from alcohol. 7.Serious complications from alcohol abuse include heart disease, liver failure, and some cancers. 8.Acute withdrawal is commonly seen in the acute hospital setting when the patient is without the abusing substance for hours or days. 9.Nursing management of patients with substance use disorders requires keen observation, setting limits, involvement of the family, and compassion.2993_Ch17_261-286 14/01/14 5:27 PM Page 282CHAPTER 17|Substance Use and Addictive Disorders 283 CASE STUDY 1.Upon entering your drug treatment facility, what information would you want to know in the admission prole about Jim's drug use? 2.In reviewing Jim's case study, at what point did the Vicodin use turn from therapeutic to substance abuse? 3.Identify two interventions you would use initially to support Jim.Jim is a 26-year-old rst-year resident in medicine at a large university hospital. His father and mother are both physicians, and he felt pressure to graduate from medical school with high honors. He struggled throughout medical school to maintain passing grades but achieved more success in his last year as he realized how much he wanted to be a doctor when he was work- ing with patients. After graduation, he ranked high enough to be selected for a residency at a prestigious hospital. During medical school, he was in a car accident that left him with residual back pain, which he managed with yoga and occa- sional ibuprofen. Once his residency began, he was work- ing long hours. Often on his feet for long hours, his back pain increased. He no longer had time for yoga and ibuprofen was no longer helping. He had an old pre- scription for Vicodin, which he took at night when he was not on call. It helped him sleep and be more rested to function well at the hospital. He obtained a pre- scription for more Vicodin from a doctorfriend based on his back pain. As time went on, he needed more pain medication to sleep and then started taking a pill during his shift when he felt jumpy. Colleagues reported Jim was irritable and at other times almost euphoric. He was called in by his supervisor when he made a prescribing error. Jim felt he needed more Vicodin to function and then he would not make errors. Then Jim's friend said he could not write any more prescriptions for him. This friend suggested he pursue pain man- agement referral. Jim was not interested and pursued other routes to get pain med- ication, including writing his own prescrip- tions to a fake patient. He had a minor car accident when he fell asleep at the wheel. When he returned home from work one day, the police arrived with a warrant for unlawful prescription writing. A local pharmacist had become suspicious and reported it to the police. Jim is now in police custody. Jim's father and his hospital supervisor arrived and proposed a drug treatment program. Jim agreed. REFERENCES American Psychiatric Association. (2000).

What symptom would you be most likely to see? a.Weight loss a national obsession, espe- cially with women. Numerous t- ness clubs are lled with individuals trying to attain the idealized thin, muscular body. The Barbie doll became the idealized female body shape for several generations. Extreme thinness is increasingly common in models and celebrities. It seems that it has become accepted behavior to be obsessed with body weight and shape and to view food as a source of stress. Self-esteem and happi- ness in young girls are often linked to weight and body shape. When this social influence is combined with certain biological, psycho- logical, and family dynamic factors, it could be the beginning of an eating disorder, in- cluding anorexia nervosa and bulimia ner- vosa (Yager & Andersen, 2005). Obesity and morbid obesity are not considered eating disorders, but their eects often lead to emotional distress. Eating disorders have little to do with simply not eating enough 287CHAPTER18 Eating Disorders Learning Objectives 1.Dene anorexia. 2.Describe the similarities and dierences between anorexia 3.Dene morbid obesity. 4.Discuss bariatric or \"weight loss\" surgery. 5.

Rather, they are psychiatric disorders with substantial emotional and physical consequences. Anorexia Nervosa The term anorexia (as used in anorexia ner- vosa) is really a misnomer because this condi- tion has very little to do with reduced appetite. It has more to do with the person's morbid fear of obesity causing anxiety and obsessive fear of losing control of food intake. In fact, the person is often hungry and views the discom- fort of hunger as a reminder of the deprivation he or she needs to inflict on himself or herself. Only in the late stages is appetite actually lost. The distorted body image causes the patient to have a personal view as fat even though appearing emaciated (Fig. 18-1). No amount of weight loss relieves the anxiety, causing this deadly cycle to continue. Complications can continue for years, even after successful treatment. Tool Box |The National Eating Disorders Association Information and Referral hotline is 800-931-2237 and web site at: www.nationaleatingdisorders.org Classroom Activity Discuss with classmates their experiences with eating disorders in themselves or friends.2993_Ch18_287-300 14/01/14 5:27 PM Page 287Women have a 0.3%-1.0% lifetime risk of suering from anorexia nervosa. Men have a prevalence of 1/10th of that risk (Hoek & van Hoeken, 2003; Yager & Andersen, 2005). Anorexia nervosa is viewed by many experts as representing struggles with autonomy and sex- uality. Onset generally peaks in the early to late teens (Anderson & Yager, 2009). Poorer prog- nosis is associated with an older age of onset, a lower minimum weight, and vomiting. Anorexic patients will go to great extremes to deprive themselves of food and use meth- ods such as excess exercise to burn up calories and purging. Purging, which causes elec- trolyte imbalance and arrhythmias through inducing vomiting or overuse of laxatives, is usually combined with compulsive exercise to accelerate weight loss, making a lethal 288 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Body image is a very personal per- spective. When working with pa- tients with eating disorders, take the time to learn about how they view their bodies. Avoid stereotyping and reacting emotionally to their ap- pearance. The fact that they look thin to you does not mean that is how they see themselves.Neeb's Tip Cultural Considerations Anorexia nervosa is most common in higher socioeconomic classes. Figure 18-1 In anorexia nervosa, patients view their bodies in a distorted way. (Photograph by Stockbyte.)Tool Box |Four questions to help screen for eating disorders by Cotton, Ball, & Robinson are available at: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/P M C 149 48 02/. lBox 18-1 Behaviors, Signs, and Symptoms of Anorexia Nervosa Excessive weight loss, usually more than 25% of body weight prior to dieting Refusal to maintain normal weight Intense fear of being fat Restricting food intake often to only 200-300 calories per day Excessive exercise Obsessive thoughts Perfectionist Absence of menstrual cycle Distorted body image Physical signs can include slow pulse rate, electrolyte imbalances, fatigue, dry skin and lanugo (ne body hair) Source: Adapted from Gorman & Sultan (2008), Townsend (2012), and Anderson & Yager (2009).combination. Successful treatment is mea - sured by weight gain, return of menstruation (usually absent in anorexic women), and re- duced number of compulsive behaviors. Full recovery of weight, growth and development, menstruation, and normal eating behavior occurs in at least 50%-70% of treated adoles- cents (Yager & Anderson, 2005). The increased awareness of this disorder is leading many to receive earlier treatment, which improves the prognosis. Symptoms of Anorexia Nervosa Some of the behaviors, signs, and symptoms associated with anorexia nervosa are listed in Box 18-1.2993_Ch18_287-300 14/01/14 5:27 PM Page 288Extreme weight loss is usually hidden to avoid exposure of the illness. Some ways the individual achieves this are by wearing baggy clothes, moving food around on the plate to give the impression of eating, exercising in secret, not eating unless certain demands about food combinations are met, or giving excuses for not eating, such as snacking before dinner. Once weight loss is exposed, the in- dividual often objects to treatment and denies the seriousness of the condition in an eort to continue to control the illness. Etiology of Anorexia Nervosa Causes of anorexia nervosa include genetic and biological factors along with psychological ones. Dopamine regulation and dysfunction of the hypothalamus are viewed as important contributors. Psychological theory suggests that the core of anorexia is the child's fear of maturing and unconscious avoidance of developmental tasks. By not eating, the person forestalls sexual development and remains a child in the family. Other dynamics include overly demanding parents and profound dis- turbance in the mother/child relationship. Anorexia can represent a way to maintain con- trol over parental gures. Anorexia requires a strong need to control one's intake, which counteracts feelings of loss of control and avoidance of conflict. Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa T reatment generally focuses on a collabora- tive approach between the following: internal medicine; behavioral approaches; nutrition counseling; individual, group, and family therapy; and pharmacological management. Specialized inpatient treatment programs are available in some areas. Mortality rate for anorexia can be high, with serious complications including bone loss, heart failure, serious arrhythmias, and electrolyte imbalances. Close medical moni- toring is essential for the patient with this dis- order. A patient with severe anorexia may require long-term hospitalization with some form of articial nutrition if severely malnour- ished. Some anorexics do better with this CHAPTER 18|Eating Disorders 289 approach as they are relieved they no longer have to make decisions about food; however, the team must consider the ethics of involun- tary re-feeding. Every eort must be made for the patient to eat voluntarily (American Psy- chiatric Association, 2006). Others become more anxious and resentful with forced re- feeding and need to try to take more drastic measures to take control of their intake by, for example, hiding weights in clothes to feign weight gain or changing drip rates on tube feedings. Total parenteral nutrition can be associated with many complications, so is usually avoided if possible. Behavior programs often include building in rewards for weight gain and restrictions for weight loss as well as keeping a food diary. Therapeutic approaches should focus on in- creasing socialization and self-esteem. Suc- cessful treatment has focused on the goals of returning to normal weight, stopping abnor- mal eating behaviors, dismantling unhealthy thoughts, treating comorbidities, and plan- ning for relapse prevention (Anderson & Yager, 2009). The dietary regimen generally promotes slow, steady weight gain of no more than 3 pounds per week ( Yager & Anderson, 2005). Patients with anorexia often have a strong need to control their environ- ment, leading to power struggles with the nurses. Neeb's Tip It is very stressful to care for a patient who refuses to eat. Nurses caring for these patients may experience frustration and anxiety as no matter what they do, the patient will not eat. Collaborating with the interdis- ciplinary team is essential.Neeb's Tip Classroom Activity Obtain information about local eating disorders treatment programs and review and discuss with classmates.2993_Ch18_287-300 14/01/14 5:28 PM Page 289Bulimia Bulimia (also called bulimia nervosa) is binge eating followed by purging in an eort to control weight. Binging is eating large quan- tities of food at one sitting. The binge eating is followed by purging, usually in the form of self-induced vomiting, though laxatives and diuretics can also be used. The purging is often a result of the shame and guilt of the binge. Bulimia was ocially designated as a psychiatric disorder in 1980 and is harder to diagnose than anorexia. Many of the behav- iors are in private, and the person may appear to be a normal weight to others (Fig. 18-2).It is common that these behaviors are hidden for years. It aects a larger cross section of the population than anorexia does. Those with bulimia rapidly consume huge amounts of food\u2014as much as 8,000 calories in a 2-hour period several times daily. Bulimia, like anorexia, tends to be manifested during adolescence. The binge may be triggered by a stressful event, feelings about weight and appearance, hunger from dieting, or negative self-image. Many celebrities have acknowl- edged a history of bulimia which has given this disorder more public attention. This dis- order is much more common in females though does exist in males. 290 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Clinical Activity Monitor electrolytes of your patient with anorexia nervosa. Critical Thinking Question Parents bring in their 14-year-old daughter, Amanda, to your primary care oce to seek help. Amanda appears pale and thin despite being dressed in a long, baggy dress. As you prepare her for her physical exam by the nurse practitioner, you are shocked by her thin body. Her spine and ribs are most prominent, she has no breasts, and her skin is dry with a ne layer of hair over her body. Amanda asks you if you think she is fat. How would you respond? Pharmacology Corner: Anorexia There are no medications to specically treat anorexia, but medications can be use- ful to help manage some of the behaviors, for example, anxiety and depression as well as obsessive-compulsive behaviors, which can be seen in some anorexics. Fluoxetine (Prozac) as well as other SSRIs have been used in some cases; however, side-eect proles can be high due to the patient being underweight. Anti-anxiety medica- tions given prior to meals have been useful for some. Figure 18-2 Bulimic woman vomiting after eating a large meal. Cultural Considerations Bulimia tends to occur in cultures where thinness is highly valued and where there is an abundance of food.2993_Ch18_287-300 14/01/14 5:28 PM Page 290Binge eating disorder is recognized by psychiatry as a disorder on its own. Individu- als with this disorder are more often obese or exhibit fluctuations in weight. This diagnosis is believed to be more common than anorexia or bulimia. Binge eating disorder is character- ized by eating large amounts of food rapidly when not hungry, eating alone, and experi- encing feelings of disgust and guilt after overeating. The person with binge eating dis- order generally does not purge. To receive this diagnosis the binging must occur at least once per week for 3 months.on dieting and how to control their weight. Their self-concept is closely tied to their appearance. Etiology of Bulimia Because bulimia has close ties to depression, bulimics may have abnormalities in levels of serotonin. An impaired satiety mechanism also could be a factor as the person may not recognize when he/she has had enough to eat. Psychological theories include low self- esteem, presence of conflict in parental rela- tionships, and family history of alcoholism and abuse. These individuals are more likely to have comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as borderline personality disorder, panic dis- order, substance use disorder, and major depression. Childhood obesity may be a con- tributing factor. Treatment of Bulimia The patient must acknowledge the disorder. Bulimics may suffer in silence for years be- fore acknowledging the need for treatment. Individual, group, and family therapy are important components of treatment to gain insight into feelings that lead up to the need to binge as well as to treat depression or other disorders. Keeping a food diary with associated feelings is a common behavioral approach. Complications of bulimia include electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, and tears in the gastric or esophageal mucosa that re- quire involvement of internal medicine and dentistry. The support group Overeaters Anonymous has been helpful for bulimics.CHAPTER 18|Eating Disorders 291 People with bulimia often keep their disorder secret and are only found out when a friend or relative nds evidence of purging behaviors such as vomiting or laxatives.Neeb's Tip Symptoms of Bulimia Box 18-2 lists the most common symptoms of bulimia. Bulimic individuals often are very self-conscious about their weight and appearance, and may focus a lot of their time Critical Thinking Question Your friend Carole constantly talks about her weight. She needs frequent reassurance that she is attractive, but then criticizes herself for being fat. She is not overweight in your opinion. She is part of group that meets monthly at a restaurant for drinks and dinner. You notice that she eats a very large, high-calorie meal each time but visits the restroom two to three times during the evening. You are wondering if she has bulimia. What else would you look for to consider bulimia?

See Table 18-1 for a summary of the differences between them.292 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Pharmacology Corner: Bulimia Because of the high correlation with de- pression, patients with bulimia are often on antidepres- sants, including fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine, are particularly helpful if there are obsessive-compulsive features with the bulimia. Other medications to treat additional psychiatric disorders such as anxiety disorder, substance abuse, and bipolar disorder may be used as well. lTable 18-1 Comparison of Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Anorexia Nervosa Bulimia Epidemiology More than 95% female 90% female Younger adolescent onset Young adult onset more likely fairly rare 2-3 times more frequent than anorexia Appearance Emaciated Normal or overweight Below normal weight Weight fluctuations Family Rigid, perfectionistic More overt conflict Overprotection Behavior Introverted Impulsive Socially isolated More histrionic, acting out High achiever Depressed Excessive exercise Signs Cachexia Dehydration Hair loss Chronic hoarseness Prognosis 5%-18% mortality rate Death is rarer Frequent lifelong problems Lifelong problems with food with food Bulimia Depression Source: Gorman and Sultan (2008). Psychosocial Nursing for General Patient Care, 3rd ed. Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company, with permission.Morbid Obesity Morbid obesity often leads to a lifetime of emotional, social, and physical problems. Potential health problems include a wide range of chronic conditions, including hyper- tension, cardiac problems, diabetes, respiratory insuciency, and joint and back disorders. Risk of death increases with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30. (See Box 18-3 to determine BMI.) Nutritional deciencies are also extremely common because the obese person may lack a well-balanced diet or experience protein deciencies related to crash dieting. Obesity is not classied as a psychiatric disorder, but it may include features of binge eating disorder and depression. Society often views morbidly obese individ- uals as undesirable. They may be abused by strangers and treated with contempt by family members. Even health-care professionals may view them as emotionally disturbed, though there is no increased incidence of psychopathol- ogy in morbidly obese people. Others may 2993_Ch18_287-300 14/01/14 5:28 PM Page 292view these individuals as lazy, unkempt, and lacking in self-control. Many experts promote viewing these individuals as having a chronic illness rather than a cosmetic problem. Morbidly obese people face discrimination particularly in the workplace because they are viewed as less healthy, less diligent, and less in- telligent than their thinner peers. Certainly, with this kind of reaction, it is no wonder that these people often experience poor self-esteem, feelings of isolation and helplessness, and loss of control. Morbidly obese individuals often have subjected themselves to many weight-loss strategies only to regain the weight, which in- creases the stress on the body. Some educators have noted that fewer than 50% of health-care professionals advise obese patients to lose weight (Goldsmith, 2000). Reasons for this low percentage include dis- comfort about addressing the subject, lack oftime to talk with the client, and a belief that this recommendation will not make any dif- ference. Yet it has been found that a client is more likely to try to lose weight if he or she is advised to do so by a health-care profes- sional. However, extremely obese people may avoid regular medical care because of shame about their weight. The U.S. Preventive Serv- ices Task Force has recommended that health- care providers identify people with a BMI greater than 30 and refer them for weight loss counseling (2012). Obesity in children and teens is a serious health concern in the United States and glob- ally. Long-term emotional eects include de- pression, social isolation, poor self-esteem, and poor academic performance. These can lead to lifelong problems (Cornette, 2008). All nurses will encounter morbidly obese patients in their practices. Sensitivity to the patient's fears, embarrassment, and coping mechanisms should be incorporated in the treatment plan. Having properly sized equip- ment like wheelchairs and beds and scales can avoid embarrassment. Etiology of Morbid Obesity Causes of morbid obesity are complex. Genetic factors are considered a predisposing factor. Abnormalities in the brain related to satiety, abnormalities of the thyroid gland, and de- creased insulin production are some of the many factors that may contribute to morbid obesity. Psychological theories include ten- dency toward depression and use of food to comfort oneself related to past traumas such as sexual abuse. Overeating as a learned response to stress, tension, and boredom, along with a sedentary lifestyle and poor nutrition, must be incorporated into the complex picture. Treatment of Morbid Obesity Obesity is a complex issue, and any weight- loss program needs to include a multidisci- plinary approach. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (2012) developed federal guidelines for clinicians to help their patients lose weight. It recommends that successful weight-loss programs need to include: Behavioral management activities such as setting weight-loss goalsCHAPTER 18|Eating Disorders 293 Cultural Considerations Morbid obesity aects all ages and races, although it is much more common in lower socioeconomic groups. Obesity is equally distributed between men and women. Childhood obesity is also consid- ered a national health problem that can lead to a lifetime of problems.Tool Box |BMI Calculator: www.bmi-calculator.net/ (also see Box 18 -3) lBox 18-3 Example of Body Mass Index Calculation BMI = Weight (in kilograms) \u00f7 Height in meters squared Example: What is the BMI of a 180-pound woman who is 5 feet tall (60 inches)?

When these measures have been unsuc- cessful, some people pursue surgical inter- ventions, called bariatric surgery. The most common surgeries are the lap band and the gastric bypass. The lap band creates restric- tion of the stomach using a silicone band, which can be adjusted by addition or re- moval of saline through a port placed just under the skin. This operation can be per- formed laparoscopically. In gastric bypass, a small stomach pouch is created with a stapler device and connected to the distal small intestine. Generally, bariatric surgery is considered only for people with a BMI greater than 40 or for those with a BMI greater than 35 with serious medical compli- cations related to the excess weight, such as diabetes. After weight loss surgury, patients need support and education to adjust to their new bodies. Behavioral approaches to address triggers for overeating can be part of counseling. Self-help groups like Overeaters Anonymous or Weight Watchers can be a major source of support. Web-based support programs to manage weight are increasingly popular. These support programs can be helpful even after bariatric surgery.Nursing Care of Patients With Eating Disorders Common nursing diagnoses in patients with eating disorders include the following: Body image, disturbed Coping, ineective Nutrition, imbalanced: less than body requirements Powerlessness Self-esteem, disturbed294 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health Cultural Considerations Some cultures are more accepting of obe- sity than others. Knowing the patient's cultural group can give some insight into whether obesity is considered a problem to the patient.Clinical Activity Attend an Overeater's Anonymous meeting in your community.Critical Thinking Question Your 35-year-old patient is in the hospital for complications from a recent abdominal surgery. This man weighs more than 400 pounds. He is withdrawn and appears depressed. When you bring in his dinner tray, he tells you to take it away as he does not want to eat because the doctor told him he has to lose 100 pounds quickly. How should you respond? What options can be given to this patient? Pharmacology Corner: Morbid Obesity In 2012 the FDA approved two weight loss drugs\u2014the rst new drugs in more than 12 years. Qsymia (formerly called Qnexa) combines the appetite suppressant phenter- mine and the anti-seizure/migraine drug topiramate. Phentermine was once widely prescribed as the \"phen\" part of the fen- phen weight loss drug that was popular in the 1990s. This combination was with- drawn from the market after its use was linked to high blood pressure in the lungs and heart valve disease. The problems were related to the \"fen\" or fenfluramine part of the combination, not the phentermine. The other drug approved for weight loss is Belviq (lorcaserin), which promotes a small amount of weight loss with fewer side eects by activating serotonin receptors that aect appetite. Both of these new drugs should not be used in pregnancy. Xenical is the only other FDA-approved weight loss drug and is sold over the counter as Alli.2993_Ch18_287-300 14/01/14 5:28 PM Page 294Nutrition, imbalanced: more than body requirements General Nursing Interventions 1.Promote positive self-concept: Gaining the patient's trust and giving positive rein- forcement for the progress the patient makes will help the patient learn to change his or her lifestyle. 2.Promote healthy coping skills: Nurses who understand that developing healthy coping skills is time consuming and dicult for anyone with an eating disorder are able to demonstrate condence that the patient can change. Empathy for the depth of these disorders will help gain the patient's trust and cooperation. The nurse must be careful not to be manipulated into nega- tive behaviors by the patient with anorexia. Setting limits on behavior is part of the plan of care. Having the patient consis- tently stay within those limits is part of teaching new lifestyle behaviors. 3.Promote adequate nutrition: The physi- cian and dietitian or nutritionist will meet with the patient to discuss calorie and nutrient requirements. Most of these patients will have nutritional deciencies\u2014 even those who are overweight. Nurses are responsible for monitoring the patient's ability and willingness to con- sume the specied amount of food. Usually, smaller and more frequent meals are tolerated better than the traditional three larger meals. For a person with an aversion to food, presenting a large tray of food can be overwhelming and discouraging. Positive reinforcement for complying with caloric intake can be helpful. Note: When implementing this type of behavior modication, the nurse would be better served to praisethe caloric intake or the healthy food choices, not the weight change. How nurses word the reinforcement can be crucial to the patient's willingness to continue the plan of care (Berkman et 2006; Crisafulli, Von 2011). 4.Promote self-acceptance: Anxiety over one's body image is a frequent contrib- utor to distress in these patients. Pro- moting self-acceptance, feedback, and realistic expectations are all important. Encourage the patient to think about accomplishments unrelated to body weight. See Table 18-2 for specic interventions for each eating disorder.CHAPTER 18|Eating Disorders 295 Critical Thinking Question You are caring for a 21-year-old woman with anorexia nervosa. She is in the hospital receiving enteral feedings due to extreme weight loss. She just started eating small amounts of food as well. When you walk in the room, you see the patient staring at her tray and looking very anxious. She tells you, \"Take this away.\" How should you respond? What factors might have triggered this reaction? Classroom Activity If caring for an anorexic patient, review the care plan so consistent behavioral approaches are followed. Review recommendations from the nutritionist. For the morbidly obese patient, identify ahead of time what resources are available to assist in patient care, for example, scale, bed, proper size wheelchair, and proper size patient gown.The nursing care plan for patients with eat- ing disorders is provided in Table 18-3.2993_Ch18_287-300 14/01/14 5:28 PM Page 295296 UNIT 2|Threats to Mental Health lTable 18-3 Nursing Care Plan for Patients With Anorexia Nursing Assessment Diagnosis Goal Interventions Evaluation Emaciated patient describes self as fat; Wears baggy clothesBody image disturbanceRefers to her body in a more positive wayAvoid overreacting or insincere response to self-deprecating comments.

Establish appropriate behaviors in terms of exercise and food preparation. Avoid focusing on food all the time. Encourage other interests. Bulimia Nervosa Approach with positive, realistic expectations of food intake. Help patient identify feelings when he or she gets the urge to binge or purge. Encourage eating in public. Monitor for eating in secret. Provide support during meals and discourage use of bathroom after eating. Promote a realistic body image by discussing how patient views self. Help patient identify feelings associated with eating. Incorporate ways to promote improved self-concept. Morbid Obesity Work with patient, family, physician, and dietitian to formulate healthy meal plans. Encourage patient to participate in groups to promote acceptance of self and development of self-esteem. Make eorts to promote improved self-concept. Respect privacy. Work with patient to identify small, achievable goals in weight loss plan. Encourage keeping a diary of food intake. Discuss feelings associated with eating. Work with team to develop a realistic exercise regimen. Help patient look at weight loss in small increments rather than total weight loss goal. Promote dignity by being sensitive to patient's appearance in public. Plan ahead to right-size equipment available, such as wheelchairs. Promote positive self-image and acceptance of body by emphasizing personal traits other than weight. Continue to provide support and education after weight loss surgery.2993_Ch18_287-300 14/01/14 5:28 PM Page 296CHAPTER 18|Eating Disorders 297 Key Concepts 1.Eating disorders of one type or another aect large numbers of people in the United States. 2.Though most common in women, anorexia and bulimia are increasingly common in men. 3.Bariatric surgery is becoming far more common than in years past. There are many physical and emotional considera- tions required when caring for patients undergoing this surgery. 4.Eating disorders are serious and can be fatal as a result of malnutrition and electrolyte disturbances. 5.Eating disorders may be related to emo- tional or physical causes. Obesity may have genetic and emotional causes. 6.Nursing interventions for eating disorder center on promoting self-esteem and trust. CASE STUDY 1.What disorder is Penny most likely suering from? 2. How could Penny get help for her eating disorder? 3.If Penny came to your mental health clinic, what nursing interventions should be considered?Penny is a 22-year-old woman who has recently graduated from college. She has struggled with her weight all her life. She frequently refers to herself as fat and unat- tractive though her weight appears normal for her height. Friends frequently encour- age her to be more accepting of herself. She is currently job hunting and spends most days at a coee shop searching for jobs on her computer. She rarely eats during the day, but while alone in her apartment atnight she becomes increasing anxious. Penny has kept bags of cookies and potato chips hidden and often eats entire packages of these items. While she is eating these items, she reports feeling relaxed, but shortly after, her stomach aches and she feels anxious and guilty. She often reduces her anxiety by sticking her nger down her throat to induce vomiting. After vomiting, she collapses in bed and often cries herself to sleep.

Many factors contribute to this, including greater access to mental health information by parents and teachers. However, stresses on children today are much different than in previous generations and are contributing as well. The fast pace of life, the Internet, social media, continuous exposure to news, instant access to information, and exposure to vio- lence at a young age all lead to children growing up more quickly and having to deal with many issues that previous generations never addressed until they were much older. The growing trend toward bullying and especially cyberbullying, where the Internet is used to embarrass or shame peers, has added another stressor that young peoplemay encounter. The frequency of divorce, less traditional family roles, and parents working outside of the home has led to a generation that must cope with stresses ear- lier in life. Many children are dealing with anxieties that were unknown in previous generations, which contributes to a variety of disorders. Children and adolescents are at risk for developing many of the same mental health disorders as adults. Family history of sub- stance abuse, schizophrenia, and bipolar dis- order will impact the development of mental health problems in children and adolescents. Family dynamics will influence the develop- ment of many disorders as well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data show that approximately 13% of children ages 8 to 15 had a diagnosable mental disorder2993_Ch19_301-322 14/01/14 5:28 PM Page 303304 UNIT 3|Special Populations within the previous year (CDC, 2013). The most common disorder among this age group is attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which affects 8.5% of this popu- lation. This is followed by mood disorders broadly at 3.7% and major depressive dis - order specifically at 2.7%. Other less com- mon disorders include conduct, anxiety, and eating disorders. Mental disorders in children can lead to a lifetime of problems including poor peer relationships, problems in school, substance use and risk-taking behaviors as well as being more likely to develop a chronic psychiatric illness. Forty percent of children with mental disorders will develop a second one (CDC, 2013). Of concern is that many children do not get ad- equate early treatment, perhaps due to de- nial on the part of parents and teachers; lack of mental health services, especially in the schools; lack of funding; and stigma. This chapter will discuss depression, bipolar dis- order, suicide, ADHD, autism spectrum dis- order, and conduct disorder. Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and Suicide in Children and Adolescents Depression Children and adolescents do exhibit symp- toms of major depressive and dysthymic dis- orders. The symptoms are the same as in the adult illness (see Chapter 11). In addition to the classic general symptoms of depression, children may exhibit a change in their school routines, such as truancy or dropping sports/ clubs, changes in sleep habits, and extreme irritability. They may become inattentive, experience a drop in grades, lose interest, or become anxious about being at school. Ado- lescents who become depressed may show all of the classic symptoms of depression and those connected with childhood but may also be trying to deal with changes happening in their bodies, hormones adjusting, and social role and peer group changes. Adolescent symptoms of depression may include rebel- lion, intense ambivalence, anger, rage, pes- simism, and low self-esteem (Figs. 19-1 and 19-2). Estimates are that 8.2% of youths between ages 12 and 17 suer from major depression in the past year, with girls at twice the risk (SAMHSA National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2008). In children, it is be- lieved that the major factor in development of depression is family influence. If parents are depressed, the children are three times more likely to be depressed than their age- mates. Environment and biochemical imbal- ances in the brain are also possible causes. The parents of children with any mental health disorder are under tremendous stress. This stress may be expressed as frustration, irritabil- ity, extreme fatigue, depression, and increased use of alcohol/drugs. Neeb's Tip Other siblings in the home are also at high risk for acting out, as they often feel ignored with all the at- tention on their sibling with the mental health disorder.Neeb's Tip Classroom Activity Participate/volunteer in a pediatric camp for children and teens with emotional problems. Clinical Activity Review the patient's medical chart for family his- tory and social worker's notes on family dynamics and coping when caring for a child with mental health issues.Tool Box |National Institute of Mental Health Information on Childhood and Ado- lescent Depression: www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression/ depression-in-children-and-adolescents.shtml Depression in children and teens may be masked as withdrawn, anti- social behavior; avoiding school; or loss of condence.Neeb's Tip2993_Ch19_301-322 14/01/14 5:28 PM Page 304improved treatment. Interestingly, in the past, children who were diagnosed with bipolar disorder (perhaps inaccurately) had a greater tendency toward anxiety and de- pression as adults rather than bipolar symp- toms. DSM-5 has a new diagnostic category under Depressive Disorders named Disrup- tive Mood Dysregulation Disorder. This disorder is characterized by severe temper outbursts with irritable or angry mood in at least two settings in children but no clear manic episodes. This new diagnostic cate- gory may include some children that were previously diagnosed as bipolar. Substance use could also contribute to symptoms of this disorder. Children and teens with any of the follow- ing need a thorough evaluation by a child psychiatrist to obtain an accurate diagnosis: extreme mood swings of depression and hy- peractivity, delusions of grandeur, pressured speech, euphoria, and decreased need for sleep. Accurate diagnosis is essential so the appropriate medications and other treatments can be started. As with adults, the major contributor to this disorder is family history. CHAPTER 19|Childhood and Adolescent Mental Health Issues 305 Figure 19-1 Adolescent symptoms of depres- sion may include rebellion, intense ambiva- lence, anger, rage, pessimism, and low self-esteem. Figure 19-2 Children who are depressed may seem bored and unusually irritable. Bipolar Disorder Bipolar disorder is more dicult to diagnose in childhood and may be confused with con- duct disorder or attention-decit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Some experts think bipolar disorder has been overdiagnosed in children and teens. DSM-5 requires bipolar disorder to include distinct episodes of mania that dier from baseline personality with or without de- pression episodes. (See Chapter 12 for more information on bipolar disorder.) Children with bipolar disorder generally do not have the typical cycling of mania to depression as seen in adults. Some behaviors associated with childhood mania include episodes of: Hyperactivity Grandiose delusions Irritability Rapid speech/racing thoughts Reduced need and desire for sleep Hopefully, more accurate diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children will lead to 2993_Ch19_301-322 14/01/14 5:28 PM Page 305306 UNIT 3|Special Populations Suicide Suicide is the second leading cause of death in teenagers (Fig. 19-3). The frequency of suicide attempts in adolescents has taken an alarming increase in recent years. Eleven and a half percent of females and 5.4% of males of high school age have attempted suicide (National Institute of Mental Health Statistics on Suicide, 2012). Peer pressures with the increased use of social media and the presence of bullying have left some vul- nerable teens viewing their lives as hopeless. In addition, young people may view suicide in a more romanticized way and be desensi- tized to death, which may be a contributor in suicide pacts. Depression and bipolar disorders are major contributors to suicide risk, but others, including substance abuse and ADHD, can also be factors. Younger children can also attempt suicide and may think of it as a magical way to get back at parents or others. Lesbian, gay, bisexual,and transgender youths are at especially high risk as they struggle with fitting in with their peers. Gender dysphoria, also known as gender identity disorder, where the child or teen is struggling with his/her sexual identity, can increase the risk for depression and suicide. Signs of suicide risk can include: Talking a lot about death Asking questions about death Giving away possessions Artwork or play with death themes Loss of interest in friends/sports Evidence of substance abuse Poor sleeping habits Expression of hopelessness, self-hate Previous suicide attempts Young people's methods of suicide may be similar to those of adults, for example, using firearms or hanging, but also include impulsive acts (especially common in young children) such as jumping out of a window or running in front of cars. As with adults, talking about suicide and previous attempts are common warnings that must be taken seriously.Tool Box |NIH brochure for children and teens and their parents on bipolar disorder: www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/ bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-teens-easy- to-read/who-develops-bipolar-disorder.shtml Figure 19-3 Suicides among teenagers are growing alarmingly. Many of the teens who attempt suicide state feelings of anger and frustration about not being listened to or not being taken seriously as the reason for their action. (Courtesy of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Atlanta, GA.) Children can be very sensitive to re- jection, which can lead to suicidal thoughts and impulsive acts. Any time a child mentions any thought about suicide, investigate fully. Never minimize his/her concerns.Neeb's Tip Clinical Activity Be aware of your patient's changes in behavior that can signal exacerbation of depression, bipolar disorder, or suicidal intent. Cultural Considerations These conditions cross all ethnic groups. In the past, these disorders were less fre- quently diagnosed in non-Caucasian soci- ety, but now parents and the education system are more informed to improve earlier identication across all groups.2993_Ch19_301-322 14/01/14 5:28 PM Page 306Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and Suicide T reatment of depression and bipolar disorder in these age groups is challenging. Group ther- apy, family therapy, individual psychotherapy, and partial or day-hospital programs have been shown to be helpful for many in this age group. T reatment should focus on strengthen- ing coping skills and support. Parental in- volvement is essential for recovery. Psycho- education focuses on teaching patients and parents life skills, communication, problem solving, and early signs of relapse to cope with these disorders. Any sign of suicide risk in a child/teen requires immediate intervention including psychiatric evaluation. See Chapter 13 for specic interventions. CHAPTER 19|Childhood and Adolescent Mental Health Issues 307 Critical Thinking Question Your new patient is a 10-year-old boy who has just been admitted to the pediatric unit after being hit by a car. His injuries are not life threatening. A neighbor told the paramedics she saw the boy run into the street right at the car. She thought he did it on purpose in a suicide attempt. The boy's parents report he has been bullied by two older boys lately and has been very upset, but they refuse to consider this a suicide attempt. What other information would you want to know about the patient and family? What interventions should the sta consider for this boy? Denial of a child's suicide risk can lead to tragedy when the call for help is not recognized out of a belief that a child would not attempt suicide.Neeb's Tip Pharmacology Corner: Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and Suicide Antidepressants are not always helpful and can be dangerous in the younger age group with depression. In September 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States recommended that a strong caution be placed on antidepressant medications for children and teenagers due to increased risk of suicide. The caution that suicide can be a side eect of antidepressants led to the black box warning that is now on all antidepressants. Doctors and parents need to weigh the benets against potential risks of using these medications. SSRIs including fluoxetine and escitalopram have been approved for treatment in adolescents. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are not often used because of the food con- traindications associated with them. Some tricyclic antidepressants can cause cardiac arrest and death in children and adolescents. Still, medications may be needed and should be used cautiously and monitored carefully. Bipolar disorder is treated with mood sta- bilizers as in adults as well as with antipsy- chotics if needed. See Chapter12. Children and adolescents may need to remain on medications for years, so accurate diagnosis and long-term management of side eects is essential. Suicidal behavior is treated with antide- pressants and anti-anxiety medications. See Chapter 13. When children are diagnosed with a serious psychiatric disorder early in life, the long-term side eects of eective medica- tions are a major concern and must be weighed with the potential benets. Parents may be faced with dicult choices and will need counseling and support as these deci- sions are needed.

Information on Surviving Care of Children and Adolescents With Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and Suicidal Behavior Common nursing diagnoses for children and adolescents with depression include the following: Anxiety Coping, ineective Hopelessness Injury, risk for Self-esteem, low General Nursing Interventions 1.Communicate honestly and eectively and at an age-appropriate level. 2.Identify limits and boundaries. Explain what is appropriate behavior and what is not acceptable. Be clear and concise. Place the emphasis in the \"positive.\" For example, to an angry individual a nurse might say, \"You may hit the punching bag in the gym, but not another person.\" 3.Focus on child/adolescent's strengths. They should be structured but able to flex fre- quently with the child/adolescent's needs. 4.Support the individual; encourage verbal- ization of feelings and thoughts. Do not minimize the child's fears and concerns. Young children especially can benet from art therapy to express their feelings.5.Encourage the completion of simple tasks. Give the child honest feedback on all successes. 6.Provide a safe environment where the child feels comfortable to share fears and concerns and has an outlet for pent-up energy and frustration. 7.Respond to any self-destructive behavior with concern and action to maintain safety. Encourage the child who has self- destructive thoughts to talk with an adult. Children should be taught to never keep secret another's suicidal plan. See Chapters 11, 12, and 13 for more in- terventions for depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, and suicide. See Nursing Care Plan in Table 19-1.308 UNIT 3|Special Populations Ensure that parents are familiar with all potential side eects and required monitoring for their child.Neeb's Tip lTable 19-1 Nursing Care Plan for the Depressed Child Nursing Data Collection Diagnosis Plan/Goal Intervention Evaluation Low self- esteemChild will demonstrate increased feelings of self-worthEncourage the child to talk about his fears and insecurities in a supportive setting without judgment; Plan activities that provide opportunities for success; Avoid minimizing his fears; Give immediate feedback on any successesChild returns to one activity he previously enjoyed; Able to ver- balize his strengths and successesChild is increas- ingly isolated, refusing to go to school, drops out of sports, is irrita- ble, reports feeling unable to meet teachers' and par- ents' expectationsCritical Thinking Question The mother of your 14-year-old patient who has been admitted after a suicide attempt asks to talk to you. She is understandably quite distressed and asks you to make sure the doctor starts her son on an antidepressant. What teaching needs to be given to the family about antidepressants and teens who have suicidal thoughts? Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder Attention-decit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a pattern of behavior involving inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity. For this di- agnosis the child must display symptoms in more than one setting for example at home,2993_Ch19_301-322 14/01/14 5:28 PM Page 308in church, at school, or while in the shopping mall. This disorder leads to problems in so- cial, education, and/or work performance. It is grouped under Neurodevelopmental Dis- orders in DSM-5. The diagnosis is generally made by the age of 12. ADHD can continue into adulthood, and generally adults with ADHD remember having behavior problems by the age of 12. About half of children with ADHD continue to have troublesome symp- toms of inattention or impulsivity as adults. However, adults are often more capable of controlling behavior and masking diculties. ADHD in children younger than age seven is a bit more challenging to diagnose, since the younger child is prone to shorter attention as a result of the child's developmental stage. ADHD is more common in males and does seem to have a pattern of running in families. The troublesome behaviors must be present for at least 6 months to a degree that is mal- adaptive and inconsistent with developmental level to conrm this diagnosis. The symptoms of ADHD are divided into inattentive and hyperactivity/impulsivity (Box 19-1). Children can have one or both categories of symptoms to receive this diagnosis. ADHD can be confused with depression, lack of sleep, learning disabilities, bipolar dis- order, tic disorders, and general behavior problems. Every child suspected of having ADHD should be carefully examined by a doctor to rule out other possible conditions or reasons for the behavior before pursuing a diagnosis with other professionals such as teachers, psychologists, and other therapists. Because children with ADHD put great demands on family life, they may be at higher risk for punitive responses from par- ents and teachers, which can increase their distress. The presence of ADHD puts the child at risk for a lifetime of maladaptive behaviors and impaired social relationships, so early identification and treatment are im- portant. In addition, children with ADHD are prone to substance abuse, depression, anxiety, conduct disorders, and learning dis- abilities. Children with this disorder are gen- erally of average or above-average intelligenceCHAPTER 19|Childhood and Adolescent Mental Health Issues 309 Cultural Considerations In the past, ADHD was diagnosed mainly in Caucasians and under recognized in other ethnic groups. Now with improved diagnostic tools and more awareness, this disorder is recognized in many ethnic groups. Cultural norms also need to be taken into consideration when determin- ing what is considered \"normal\" behavior for children within a particular group. Children need to be assessed in their na- tive language to avoid confusion about their concerns. lBox 19-1 Symptoms of ADHD Inattentive symptoms: 1.Fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork 2.Has diculty keeping attention during tasks or play 3.Does not seem to listen when spoken to directly 4.Does not follow through on instructions and fails to nish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace 5.Has diculty organizing tasks and activities 6.Avoids or dislikes tasks that require sus- tained mental eort (such as schoolwork) 7.Often loses toys, assignments, pencils, books, or tools needed for tasks or activities 8.Is easily distracted 9.Is forgetful Hyperactivity/Impulsivity symptoms: 1.Fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat 2.Leaves seat when remaining seated is expected 3.Runs about or climbs in inappropriate situations 4.Has diculty playing quietly 5.Is often \"on the go,\" if \"driven by a motor\" 6.Talks excessively 7.Blurts out answers before questions have been completed 8.Has diculty waiting for his/her turn 9.Interrupts others Source: Adapted from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (Copyright 2013).

See Box 19-2 for list of potential causes. Combinations of organic, genetic, and environmental factors may put a person at higher risk. It is common that parents of the ADHD child showed signs of hyperactivity in their childhoods, indicating a strong genetic component. Abnormal levels of neurotransmit- ters are associated with many of the symptoms of ADHD, as is abnormal brain function. Chaotic family life is also a factor. Some children have benetted from diet modications such as eliminating foods like milk products or sugar.school and home life can make a dierence. This can include a system of rewards and con- sequences to help guide their child's behavior and handle disruptive behaviors. Support groups can help parents connect with others who have similar problems. Parents need on- going support programs.310 UNIT 3|Special Populations lBox 19-2 Possible Causes of ADHD Genetics\u2014family history is a strong predictor Altered secretion of neurotransmitters like dopamine Altered brain anatomy Prenatal exposure to alcohol Exposure to lead Reaction to food dyes, additives, sugar Chaotic family life Source: Adapted from National Institutes of Mental Health (2012) and Townsend (2012).Clinical Activity Identify triggers in the environment that lead to your ADHD patient's disruptive behavior. Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Attention- Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Though medications are commonly used to treat ADHD, they should be used in com- bination with other therapies. Psychotherapy for the child and family is often helpful, along with cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on learning new coping mechanisms. The child needs to learn the consequences of impulsive behavior and identify alterna- tives, and learn how to improve social skills. Close involvement of the child's teachers can help with learning and behavior. Parents need to develop skills to address their child's disruptive behaviors. A structuredTool Box |National ADHD Children and and parents: www.Chadd.org Pharmacology Corner: Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder Medications are the most common treatment approach. As with other illnesses aecting young people, use of medication is contro- versial. Physicians must consider the physical maturity of a child's brain, liver, and kidneys as well as the child's ability to handle other eects of medication before prescribing. Psychostimulants (also known as stimu- lants) are the most commonly used ADHD drugs. Although these drugs are called stimu- lants, they actually have a calming eect on people with ADHD by increasing the levels of neurotransmitters. These medications can increase the child's ability to concentrate and reduce hyperactivity and impulsiveness. New long-acting formulations, liquids, powders that can be sprinkled on food, and transder- mal patches are available for some of these medications to help with compliance. The major side eects of these agents include over- stimulation, restlessness, insomnia, anorexia, weight loss, headache, and irritability (Roman, 2011). See Table 19-2 for the com- mon pharmacological treatment of ADHD. Nursing considerations for children on stimulant medications include: Administer after eating or with meals to reduce eect on appetite.2993_Ch19_301-322 14/01/14 5:28 PM Page 310Injury, risk for Self-concept, alteration in Self-esteem Social interaction, impaired General Nursing Interventions 1.Eective communication: Therapeutic communication with the child/adolescent and the involved family members is always indicated. Teaching/modeling skills to assist with interpersonal family communication is helpful. 2.Assist with behavior modification tools: Limit setting, reward systems, and positive reinforcement may be helpful. Facilitate agreement between the par- ents and child/adolescent regarding what will be used as the reward, what is fair, and what the consequence to inappropriate behavior will be. Consis- tency among all parties is crucial in this modality. 3.Promote self-esteem: Help the child com- plete a task and reward with praise or other rewards. Give positive feedback for all appropriate behavior. Teach alter- native behaviors. It can be helpful to break down tasks into small steps to reduce frustration from poor attention span. Reinforce socially acceptable be- havior rather than giving a lot of atten- tion to negative behaviors. 4.Low stimulation environment: Identify the signs when behavior is beginning to escalate and intervene to reduce stim- ulation. Physical activity can be a good outlet for pent-up energy, followed by a quieter environment.CHAPTER 19|Childhood and Adolescent Mental Health Issues 311 lTable 19-2 Common Pharmacological Treatment Mental Health Nursing: Concepts of Care in Evidence-Based Practice, 7th ed.

It is called a spectrum disorder because it can be present in a mild form with some peculiar behaviors and mild social isolation but otherwise normal behavior; or to the other extreme it can be severe, with profound disability in all aspects of life. Asperger's syndrome is a mild form of ASD. Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder in DSM-5. It must be present from infancy or early childhood but may not be detected until later because of minimal social demands and support from parents or care- givers in early years. 312 UNIT 3|Special Populations Critical Thinking Question Your 6-year-old patient has recently been diag- nosed with ADHD.

Autism Spectrum Disorder Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a gen- eral term that includes classic autism and Asperger's syndrome. These disorders are now classified as ASD rather than treated as separate disorders (DSM-5). ASD is a com- plex developmental disorder of brain function accompanied by intellectual and behavioral decits characterized by persistent diculties Classroom Activity View the movie Rainman about an adult with autism. DSM-5 now views autism spectrum disorder to include what was previ- ously known as Asperger's syndrome, though this is a term that is still com- monly used. These individuals have less problems with language and cognition than more severe forms of ASD. This syndrome was originally named after an Austrian pediatrician who rst described it. Sometimes these people are referred to as hav- ing high functioning autism.Neeb's Tip Tool Box |Pediatric screening tools for autism at the CDC Autism Spectrum Disor- ders Web site: www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-screening. html The single most common symptom or manifestation of ASD is impaired social interaction. Learning disabilities, avoiding making eye contact, and inability to make friends or respond to other people's emotions are other symptoms. Children with this dis- order may twirl their hair and/or perform self-injuring or self-mutilating behaviors, such as biting themselves or hitting their2993_Ch19_301-322 14/01/14 5:28 PM Page 312head on objects. Repetitive patterns can in- clude excessive adherence to routines, ritual- istic behavior, and repetitive speech or motor patterns such as rocking or spinning. Children with ASD commonly exhibit the following symptoms: No response to their name by 12 months Not pointing at objects to show interest (e.g., not pointing at an airplane flying over) by 14 months Not playing \"pretend\" games (e.g., pre- tending to \"feed\" a doll) by 18 months Avoiding eye contact and wanting to be alone Having trouble understanding other people's feelings or talking about their own feelings Delayed speech and language skills Repeating words or phrases over and over (echolalia) Giving unrelated answers to questions Getting upset by minor changes Obsessive interests Flapping their hands, rocking their body, or spinning in circles Unusual reactions to the way things sound, smell, taste, look, or feel Appearing to be in their own world (Adapted from CDC Facts about ASD, 2012) To make the diagnosis, doctors may also look at failure to meet certain developmental tasks, such as a baby not babbling or per- forming gestures (pointing, grasping, etc.) by age 12 months, or, at any age, losing any language or social skills that had been acquired. Sometimes the child may appear to have normal development and then stop gaining new skills. There are several inven- tories that the physician, psychologist, or psychiatrist might administer to help with diagnosing. Parents often notice the signs by age 2 when the child is not developing language skills and/or showing difficulty with social interaction as in not making eye contact or makes repetitive nonpurposeful movements. The incidence of ASD is on the rise. The CDC reports that 1 in 88 U.S. children have autism spectrum disorder (Centers forDisease Control and Prevention, \"Autism Spectrum Disorders,\" 2012). This is a 78% increase from 2002, reflecting the increased awareness of parents and doctors to the early signs. ASD affects males three to four times more frequently than it affects females. Sadly, at this point in time, it is not curable and most individuals will require lifelong treatment. Children with severe autism are considered disabled for life. Autism should not be confused with or misdiagnosed as schizophrenia, although some behaviors may be similar. Causes of autism are not conrmed. Ge- netics, viral infections, and chemicals found in the environment are suspected causes or contributors to development of autism. For parents with one autistic child, there is about a 5% chance of having a second child with autism. Serotonin levels have been shown to be diminished in the left frontal lobe of many with autism. Fragile X syndrome, con- genital rubella, exposure to some medications in utero, and tuberous sclerosis have been suggested as possible causes of ASD. The increased incidence of ASD has led to more emphasis on research.CHAPTER 19|Childhood and Adolescent Mental Health Issues 313 Some people continue to believe that autism is caused by childhood vaccines. This has led some parents to refuse vaccines for their infants, which can expose them to nor- mally preventable illnesses and contribute to endangerment of others. If parents are concerned about vaccines, encourage them to discuss their concerns with the physician before making any decisions.Neeb's Tip Tool Box |National Institute of Health Fact Sheet on Autism: www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/autism/detail_ autism.htm Services for people with autism and Asperger's syndrome provide resources and support: aspergersyndrome.org CDC Fact Sheet about ASD www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/facts.html2993_Ch19_301-322 14/01/14 5:28 PM Page 313314 UNIT 3|Special Populations Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder Although there is no cure for autism at this time, early identication is important. Early intervention services help children from birth to 3 years old learn important skills and en- hance development by taking advantage of the brain's ability to adapt. Services can include therapy to help the child talk, walk, and interact with others. Many new treatment programs that incorporate intensive speech, occupational, and physical therapies as well as behavioral training and management may be appropriate for some. These are home- and school-based intensive programs that have shown some success. Therapies may incorporate a structured reward system for responding to people. Each child must be evaluated individu- ally for the best treatment. There are also many unproven treatments that parents will pursue in a desperate eort to treat their child. Nursing Care of Children and Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder Common nursing diagnoses for children and adolescents with autism include the following: Injury, risk for Self-care decit Social interaction, impaired Verbal communication, impaired General Nursing Interventions 1.Maintain safety: Therapists may prescribe special equipment or even special cloth- ing, such as helmets and arm covers, to help maintain safety. The goal of this in- tervention is to discourage and prevent self-destructive behavior. Assisting par- ents to identify situations that may trig- ger the unwanted behavior is also helpful in preventing or de-escalating the behav- ior. Monitor the child closely and remove any items in the environment that may cause injury. 2.Reinforce medical and counselor teaching: Work with the parents and child on social skills. Provide praise and positive reinforcement for both the parents and Cultural Considerations ASD has been underdiagnosed in the Latino and black populations due to lack of awareness by parents and health-care professionals. This has led to later diag - nosis and treatment in these populations. Previously viewed as a disorder mainly in Caucasian children, more resources are now available to identify and treat this disorder in other races. Having a child with ASD creates tremendous physical, emotional, and nancial stress on the family. These families need information on all re- sources available in the community.Neeb's Tip Parents may be desperate for alter- native treatments and may share approaches that you nd question- able. It is important to maintain their trust and encourage them to be open to standard medical treat- ment and investigate thoroughly any alternative approach.Neeb's Tip Pharmacology Corner: Autism Spectrum Disorder Research trials for drugs to treat autism are ongoing, but so far there is no denitive pharmacological treatment. Doctors may prescribe medication for dicult symptoms such as deliberate self-injury, aggression, and uncontrollable temper tantrums. The FDA has approved the use of risperidone (Risperdal) and aripiprazole (Abilify) for children with these symptoms. Patients on these medications require close monitoring. The dosage is based on the weight of the child and clinical response. Clinical Activity Review possible side eects of any medications your ASD patient is taking. Reinforce education on medications to parents and the patient.2993_Ch19_301-322 14/01/14 5:28 PM Page 314CHAPTER 19|Childhood and Adolescent Mental Health Issues 315 child. Technology is assisting with inter- ventions for some patients. Virtual real- ity equipment and tablet computers are being used in some settings and with some success to help with teaching and behavioral training. The child may be able to relate more to these images than through interaction with others. Pet therapy, where a child can interact with a dog, cat, or through horseback riding, has shown success. 3.Maintain eective communication with all parties: Speak to the child or adoles- cent in simple, direct, age-appropriate language. Acceptance of behavior is important. Ensure that the family and others involved in the day-to-day care of the patient feel comfortable discussing concerns. 4.Maintain consistency of caregivers: The child may do better with familiar people. T ry to reduce the amount of stimulation from strangers. Keep expectations realis- tic, and recognize that progress is slow and regression to previous behaviors may occur, especially under stress. Support independence where possible. 5.Avoid overstimulating the child: Deter- mine if the child becomes more stressed with physical contact. The child may be uncomfortable with being touched. Check with the family on what the child will accept. 6.Establish a routine schedule with the child that all staff follows as much as possible.7.Parental support: Having an autistic child affects the entire family on a daily basis. They need support and resources.

These children exhibit a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated. Conduct disorder is now categorized under Disruptive, Impulse Control and Conduct Disorders in DSM-5. The diagnosis of conduct disorder is based on the presence of a pattern of aggres- sive behavior to people and/or animals, de- struction of property, deceitfulness, or theft and/or serious violation of rules. The diagno- sis is much more common among boys. The onset can be in childhood or adolescence. For an accurate diagnosis, the behavior must be far more extreme than simple adolescent re- bellion or boyish enthusiasm. It is a pattern of behavior; a one-time incident does not diagnose the condition. Some behavior pat- terns might be bullying, displaying or using a weapon, arson, lying, ghting, animal abuse, truancy from school, chronic rule breaking, and running away from home (Fig. 19-4). Careful screening and medical testing are important, as much change is happening developmentally in this age group. Conduct disorder has been known to be a precursor of bipolar disorder and/or antisocial personality in adulthood for some. Conduct disorder can occur with or be confused with ADHD, mood disorders, and learning disabilities. DSM-5 has noted several specic patternsthat are sometimes seen in conduct disorder including callousness and lack of remorse. When a person with conduct disorder has these traits, he/she is harder to treat. Conduct disorder may be preceded by oppositional deant disorder (ODD) in some children, which is a pattern of negativistic and hostile behavior toward authority gures. Causes/contributing factors to conduct disorder include a variety of factors: Victim of child abuse/neglect Drug addiction or alcoholism in the parents Family conflicts Genetic defects Poverty Exposure to toxins Head trauma, brain disorder Prenatal exposure to cocaine History of attention-decit/hyperactivity disorder Substance abuse Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Conduct Disorder Medical treatment for conduct disorder rst in- cludes a thorough assessment. Sometimes, there is an underlying medical condition in conduct disorder, such as closed head injury or a seizure disorder. The physician will need to assess and treat the underlying disorder as well as the be- haviors associated with the conduct disorder. Once the diagnosis is made, treatment in- cludes counseling for the parents and family as well as the aected child. A child psychiatrist can work with the patient to address past trau- mas and anger issues. Parenting skills, consis- tency in limit setting, and progressing maturity of the child may, over time, often lessen or eliminate the behaviors of conduct disorder, es- pecially as the child moves out of adolescence. Parent Management T raining is an approach that teaches skills to parents about more eec- tive ways to respond to episodes of aggression. Teachers need to have skills to address these issues. Residential treatment is sometimes pre- scribed for children with this disorder. Group therapy of some form can help the child relate more appropriately to his/her peer group.316 UNIT 3|Special Populations Figure 19-4 Recurrent bullying is a behavior that may indicate a conduct disorder, and it can be found among both boys and girls.

Communicate the eect that inappro- priate behavior has on others around the child. Communicate the consequences of inappropriate behavior and, most importantly, be consistent with enforc- ing those consequences. Recognize that the child may have poor skills in social situations and may need coaching or positive reinforcement. 3.Assist with behavior modication tools: Limit setting, reward systems, and positive reinforcement may be helpful. Set realistic expectations according to the child's age and ability level. Consis- tency among all parties is crucial. 4.Model and educate the family with respect to appropriate roles: In other words, par- ents need to be parents. The child needs to be the child. The parent should be in \"control\" of the situation.

Family members may have further questions for nurses. Be prepared to assist with clarication about medications. 318 UNIT 3|Special Populations Key Concepts 1.Children and adolescents do experience threats to their mental health. They have the same illnesses as adults but may manifest them in dierent ways. Some illnesses continue into adulthood. 2.Medications and therapy are eective for a great many people in these age groups. Recently, black box warnings have been applied to certain antidepressants when used with children and adolescents; some antidepressants may actually increase the chance for suicide. 3.Incidence of autism spectrum disorder has shown a dramatic increase in the last few years. It is a serious disorder that has lifelong eects. 4.Parents, family members, and other primary caregivers need to be involved in the treatment of children and adoles- cents. Consistency of care is crucial. Parents may need counseling in order to become more eective in their role as parents. 5.ADHD and conduct disorders present challenges to nurses working with chil- dren and teens. CASE STUDY 1.Given this information, what suggestions could be made to help this mother cope with the teen's behavior? How would you approach Sharon on rst meeting her? 2. What possible diagnoses do you think would be considered?Sharon, a 15-year-old girl, was brought to your family practice clinic by her mother. Her mother explained that Sharon was sus- pended from school for assaulting a teacher and needed a \"doctor's evaluation\" before she could return to class. The history reveals that this is Sharon's tenth school suspension during the past 3 years. She has previously been suspended for ghting, carrying a knife to school, smoking marijuana, andstealing money from other students' lock- ers. When asked about her behavior at home, Sharon reports that her mother fre- quently \"gets on my nerves\" and, at those times, Sharon leaves the house for several days. The family history indicates that Sharon's father was incarcerated for auto theft and assault. Sharon's mother fre- quently leaves Sharon and her 8-year-old brother unsupervised overnight.

On the other extreme are major psychiatric disorders of postpartum depres- sionand postpartum psychosis that are much rarer and much more serious. Other issues can include grief response after fetal demise and birth of a sick/imperfect baby. An example is giving birth to an infant that does not meet the mother's expectations, including an infant of the wrong sex or one who is physically chal- lenged. All of these can contribute to poor bonding with the infant that can aect the health of the whole family (Pillitteri, 2007).Postpartum Blues Postpartum blues (sometimes called tran- sient depressive symptoms) is an extremely common response to the sudden changes immediately after childbirth. It occurs in about 70% of new mothers (Pillitteri, 2007). The major cause is believed to be the plum- meting levels of estrogen and progesterone right after birth. The greater the hormone shift, the greater chance of developing post- partum blues (Elder, 2004). Other factors include fatigue and stress of delivery along with the immediate postpartum responsibil- ities. Symptoms include tears, rapid mood shifts, anxiety, and feeling overwhelmed. The symptoms typically peak at the fourth or fifth day after birth and resolve by day 10 (Ricci, 2007). The disorder is generally self- limiting and does not reflect psychopathol- ogy or the care the mother is able to provide to the new baby. The presence of postpartum blues does increase the risk for postpartum major depression. Cultural Considerations Postpartum mental disorders cross all cul- tures. Each culture has expected behaviors of new mothers, and knowledge of these can make for more accurate screening of possible psychiatric disorders.2993_Ch20_323-334 14/01/14 5:29 PM Page 323Treatment of Postpartum Blues Postpartum blues requires no psychiatric treatment. Families should be educated dur- ing the prenatal period of the frequency of this transient condition. Emotional support, compassion, and rest generally help resolve this problem in a matter of days. If the blues go on for a longer period of time (as in more than 2 weeks), there is evidence of intense anxiety about the infant, agitation, feelings of inadequacy, and being overwhelmed most of the time. More intervention is needed. This could signal that postpartum blues has moved into postpartum depression. Postpartum Depression Postpartum depression is a serious disorder that occurs in about 10% of births (Pillitteri, 2007). Some feel this condition is underdiag- nosed and undertreated particularly becausedepression in women in the general popula- tion peaks in the 25-44 age group. The symptoms are the ones typically seen in de- pression (see Chapter 11) with the addition of impaired ability to care for the baby. The majority of sufferers of postpartum depres- sion have had some type of mental health disorder earlier in life, such as a depression. The new mother may hide the symptoms for fear of being viewed as a bad mother. It is not uncommon for the depression to begin during pregnancy so this disorder is some- times referred to as depression with peripar- tum onset. The symptoms must occur within 6 months of delivery and be noticeable for at least 2 weeks to be given this diagnosis. This depression can lead to denial of the infant, inability to care for the infant, and even thoughts of hurting the infant, as well as suicidal thoughts or acts in rare, extreme cases. The strongest risk factor is depression in a previous pregnancy or postpartum depres- sion. See Box 20-1 for symptoms of postpar- tum depression and Box 20-2 for factors that contribute to postpartum depression.324 UNIT 3|Special Populations Critical Thinking Question Your postpartum patient is ready to be discharged home. Her family is surrounding her, and they are all thrilled that she had a healthy baby boy. The new mother keeps crying and asks her family to leave her alone. They are shocked and wonder why she is not happy. What would you tell the family? How would you help the patient? New mothers and their families need to be prepared for postpartum blues and reassured that the mother's re- sponse is not abnormal. New moth- ers may not verbalize their feelings out of fear of appearing to be a bad mother.Neeb's Tip Clinical Activity Incorporate support, reassurance, and rest in the care of the new mother. Provide education and resources, such as a lacta- tion consultant, if needed, to this patient. Classroom Activity Promote discussion with classmates who are mothers about their feelings during the post- partum self-assessment tool can be used by the new mother to monitor her symptoms of depression. Cultural Considerations The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is also on Mental Ill- ness Fact Sheets on Pregnancy and D epression: Depression Postpartum depression is a serious disorder that requires treatment. Early intervention is associated with a good prognosis. When the diagnosis of postpartum depression is made, the mother is usually placed on antidepressants and begins some form of psychotherapy. If the new mother is breast- feeding, she may be reluctant to take med- ications. See the Pharmacology Corner for more information on the risks associated with antidepressants. Discussion with the physician and pharmacist can be helpful to determine the risk to the baby. Some women may continue psychotherapy only, pursue alternative treatments such as light therapy, or choose to stop breastfeeding. The woman should be followed closely for at least 6 months after successful treat- ment. During treatment the family must be involved to provide support and ensure safety of the baby and mother. T reatment will help with establishing a healthy bond between the mother and baby. If left untreated, this depression can continue for months or even years. The mother should be aware that once she is diagnosed with postpartum depression, she is at high risk for recurrence of it with subsequent pregnancies. A new mother who has any symptoms of or is at risk for postpartum depression should take steps right away to get help. Some help- ful tips if a mother is experiencing early signs of postpartum depression include (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2010; P earlstein et al., 2009): Ask for help in caring for the baby Talk about these concerns with the patient's doctor and nurses Talk about one's feelings Avoid making major life changes during pregnancy or right after delivery Encourage realistic expectations of herself Take time to get out of the house without the baby, visit with friends, spend time alone with partner, participate in exercise programCHAPTER 20|Postpartum Issues in Mental Health 325 lBox 20-1 Symptoms of Postpartum Depression Anxiety Irritability Loss of interest in new baby Views infant as demanding Withdrawn Irrational guilt Sleep disturbances Loss of appetite Inability to concentrate Feels inept at caring for baby Does not feel bond or love of new baby Excessive anxiety over baby's health Feelings of worthlessness Poor concentration Loss of appetite Note: For a postpartum depression diagnosis, the symptoms must persist for at least 2 weeks. lBox 20-2 Contributing Factors to Postpartum Depression Hormone fluctuations Personal and/or family history of depression or any mood disorder History of premenstrual dysphoric disorder Stressful relationship with partner Lack of social support Major life stressors around the pregnancy Ambivalence about the pregnancy Sleep disturbance Medical problems during the pregnancy or just after birth History of a troubled childhood Pregnancy under age 20 Abuse of alcohol, illegal substancesSource: Adapted from (Berga, S.

It is sometimes called puerperal psy- chosis. It is rare as it occurs in about 0.1-0.2% of pregnancies (Berga, Parry, & Moses-Kolka, 2009). The majority of women with this disor- der have had symptoms of mental illness before pregnancy. It is most common in rst pregnan- cies and is generally evident within a few weeks of delivery. This disorder occurs most frequently in women with a history of bipolar disorder pre-pregnancy. Postpartum psychosis can actu- ally be an episode of bipolar illness. See Chapter 12 for detailed information on bipolar disorder. In fact, postpartum recovery time is considered a high-risk period for bipolar disorder recur- rence in at-risk women (Sharma & Pope, 2012). Any woman with a history of bipolar disorder should be monitored closely during pregnancy as recurrence of mania symptoms may occur. Women with a history of bipolar disorder are usually advised to discontinue lithium and some other bipolar medications due to possible adverse eects on the fetus. This puts the woman at high risk for recurrence. See the Pharmacology Corner for more informa tion. The earliest signs of postpartum psychosis are: Restlessness Irritability Insomnia These can progress quickly to: Rapidly shifting moods Erratic or disorganized behavior Delusions of grandeur or persecution Extreme impulsivity Disorganized speech and behavior Hallucinations Disorientation/confusion Delusional beliefs are common and often center on the infant, as in the infant is evil or the infant can read the mother's mind. Audi- tory hallucinations that instruct the mother to harm herself or her infant may also occur. The mother may deny the existence of the child, leading to not caring for the infant. Risk for infanticide, as well as suicide, is signicant in this population (Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Women's Mental Health, 2010). In addition to bipolar disorder, postpartum psychosis can also be categorized as Brief Psy- chotic Disorder with postpartum onset in someone without a psychiatric history (DSM -5, 2013). Postpartum depression can also move to a psychosis with paralyzing depression with hallucinations and delusions in rare cases. Postpartum psychosis right after delivery needs to be dierentiated from delirium. Delir- ium could be a reaction to many factors during delivery such as anesthesia dehydration.326 UNIT 3|Special Populations Critical Thinking Question You are working in a postpartum clinic. Your new patient is 4 weeks post-delivery. Her husband ap- proaches you with concerns about why is his wife so tired and irritable. On further questioning, he tells you she is in bed most of the day and family members are caring for the baby. What would you ask the patient when you see her for the initial screening? Clinical Activity Be aware of your postpartum patient's history and family history for psychiatric disorders. Review current and past psychiatric medications. Tool Box |National Alliance on Mental Illness has information on bipolar disorder and pregnancy of Postpartum Psychosis Immediate medical and psychiatric treatment must be instituted when postpartum psychosis is diagnosed (Fig. 20-1). Severe overactivity2993_Ch20_323-334 14/01/14 5:29 PM Page 326and delusions ization by antipsychotic drugs. Mood stabi- lizing drugs such as lithium are also useful in treatment and possibly for prevention of episodes in women at high risk (i.e., women who have already experienced manic or psy- chotic episodes). Immediate safety of the in- fant must be determined. In some cases electroconvulsive (electroshock) treatment is used. If the woman exhibits signs of psychosis during pregnancy, antipsychotic medications may need to be started. The family needs to consult with experts about the possible risks to the fetus from these medications. The location of treatment is an issue; hospitalization is disruptive to the family. It is possible to treat moderately severe cases at home, where the sufferer can maintain her role as a mother and build up her rela- tionship with the newborn. This requires the presence, around the clock, of compe- tent adults (such as father or grandparent) and frequent visits by professional staff. If hospital admission is necessary, there are advantages in conjoint mother and baby admission; however, multiple factors must be considered in the subsequent discharge plan to ensure the safety and healthy devel- opment of both the baby and mother. This plan often involves a multidisciplinary team structure to follow up on the mother, the baby, their relationship, and the entire family. Family therapy is essential in the treatment process as family members may be traumatized by the patient's bizarre behavior. CHAPTER 20|Postpartum Issues in Mental Health 327 Figure 20-1 New mother with postpartum psychosis is hearing distressing voices.Critical Thinking Question You are doing a home health 6-week follow-up visit for a postpartum patient with a history of bipolar disorder. When you walk in the house, the patient is agitated and tells you the baby is driving her crazy and she wants to get rid of him. What would you do? Pharmacology Corner T reatment of postpartum depression and psychosis usually requires psychoactive medications. Concern about the safety of these medications to the infant during pregnancy and during breastfeeding is a major issue in treatment. Informed deci- sions by the new mother as to the burden and benefit of medications require thor- ough patient education. In other words, if the medications prevent serious disorders are they worth the risk to the baby. Some concerns include: Antidepressants are excreted in breast milk. The infant could be subject to the drug's side eects. The antidepressants that have been identied as safest to the infant include paroxetine, sertraline, and nortriptyline (ACOG Committee Practice Bulletin, 2008). These have been found to have minimal side eects to the infant. The woman should be on the lowest dose possible and time breastfeeding so that it does not occur when concentration of the antidepres- sants is high. The infant should be monitored closely for side eects and normal growth. Some studies report the fetus is at in- creased risk for complications when exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. So starting antidepressants during pregnancy or during subsequent pregnancies, must be discussed in detail with the physician. Since the risk for postpartum depres- sion and psychosis in women with a history of bipolar disorder is high, considerations about continuing mood Continued2993_Ch20_323-334 14/01/14 5:29 PM Page 327Nursing Care of Women With Postpartum Mental Disorders Nursing diagnoses for women with postpar- tum mental disorders include the following: Anxiety Coping, ineective Injury, risk for Sleep pattern disturbance Thought processes, disturbed Violence to self/others, risk for General Nursing Interventions 1.Safety: Maintain safety of the patient and her infant. Any risk factors for this disorder need to be identied early in the pregnancy as a routine part of prenatal care. Anyone at risk should be monitored closely and the patient and family educated on what to look for. If the patient or infant is at any risk, immediate action must be taken to protect them. Safety also involves educat- ing the new mother about risks associated with psychiatric medications. 2.Compassion and support: Adequate sup- port for the new family must be in place. Helping the family with options for the mother to get enough rest, resources for infant care, and support groups should be in place. 3.Ongoing monitoring for high-risk pa- tients: Be aware that patients with any history of mental disorders, substance abuse, and family conflict are at higher risk for postpartum mental disorders. This information should be identied during pregnancy so adequate support and prevention strategies can be imple- mented. Listen to family members who may observe the mother's behavior. Home health visits should be arranged for any mother at high risk for postpar- tum psychiatric disorders. The patient's psychiatrist needs to be involved in the treatment plan. 4.Education: The new family needs educa- tion about the stresses of pregnancy and328 UNIT 3|Special Populations Pharmacology Corner\u2014 cont'd stabilizers during pregnancy must be discussed and the risks and benefits weighed. Risks to the fetus may in- clude a number of congenital malfor- mations, especially with lithium. In addition, the pregnant woman on lithium is more vulnerable to lithium toxicity due to fluid shifts. The psychi- atrist should be consulted for alterna- tive medications if the woman wishes to become pregnant. For women with bipolar disorder, breastfeeding may be problematic. First is the concern that on-demand breastfeeding may significantly disrupt the mother's sleep and thus may in- crease her vulnerability to relapse during the acute postpartum period. Second, there have been reports of toxicity in nursing infants related to exposure to various mood stabilizers, including lithium and carbamazepine, in breast milk. Lithium is excreted at high levels in the mother's milk. Exposure to carbamazepine and val- proic acid in the breast milk has been associated with hepatotoxicity in the nursing infant (Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Women's Mental Health, 2010). Antipsychotic and anti-anxiety medica- tions are often needed to treat psychosis as well as depression. The psychiatrist will identify those with less risk to the mother and infant. Antipsychotics are generally viewed as having less risk to mother and infant (Berga, Parry, & Moses-Kolka, 2009).

Education of the new family about postpartum blues and its transient nature should be included in childbirth classes and doctor visits. Also, education on infant care and breastfeeding can reas- sure the mother of her skills. 5.Medication management: Because the use of psychiatric medications in this popu- lation involves some risks, providing support and education is essential. 6.Further Interventions: See Chapters 10,11,12, and 15 for specic interven- tions for anxiety, depression, mania, and psychosis.

These blues generally do not require any psychiatric treatment. 2.Women with postpartum blues that go on for more than 2 weeks should be evaluated for postpartum depression. 3.Postpartum depression is often associated with a previous history of mood disorders. CASE STUDY 1.Given this information, what would be your primary concern for Janice? 2.What would you ask Janice when you go in to see her? 3.What support options should be recommended for the boyfriend/father?Janice is a 21-year-old experiencing her rst pregnancy. She lives with the father of the baby and has additional support from her mother and grandmother. Janice has a his- tory of substance abuse, including cocaine and opioids, as well as depression, but she denies any drug use during the pregnancy. She is in her 8th month of pregnancy. Upon arrival at the clinic, she appears tear- ful, unkempt, and sad. Her boyfriend tells you she has been sleeping for days and does not talk to him. He noticed a big change inher behavior 4 weeks ago when she became more withdrawn and tearful. The boyfriend said she told him she does not want to think about the baby and does not want to participate in preparations. She says she is too tired to think about it. The boyfriend works long hours to make ends meet and condes in you that he does not know what they will do when the baby comes, if she remains in this condition. He is considering having Janice's mother take the baby if this continues. 4.Postpartum psychosis is a rare disorder and often associated with a history of bipolar disorder. 5.Pharmacological treatment of these dis- orders may be associated with risks dur- ing pregnancy and breastfeeding. 6.Any pregnant woman with a history of psychiatric disorders should have psychiatric follow-up.2993_Ch20_323-334 14/01/14 5:29 PM Page 330U.S. National Library of Medicine.

Geriatrics is the branch of medicine caring for older adults. The study of older adults is a specialty in nursing. With more and more North Americans reach- ing age 65 within the next 10 to 15 years, learn- ing the complications, abilities, and best ways to assist that population is a very timely study. According to the Administration on Aging of the Department of Health and Human Services, \"The population of 65+ will increase from 35 million in 2000 to 55 million in 2020.\"When children are 10 years old, they cannot wait to be 16 so they can drive a car. Sixteen-year-olds want to be 18 so they can be out on their own. When they turn 30, the idea of time passing begins to take on a dier- ent tone for some people. In a society that promotes the image of youth, many people of this age see youth vanishing. They might feel they are not as fast or as thin or as healthy as they were in their 20s. Still, they see healthy, happy people over age 65 working, recreating, and socializing. Life expectancy in the United States is in the 76 for men and the early 81for women (World Health Organization, 2011). So, what is this process of aging? Aging begins at the moment of birth. Neeb's Tip Aging happens to everyone, and nobody has control over it. It is a condition of time passing. It is also a condition that researchers are beginning to redene: What is \"old age\"? Critical Thinking Question How do you dene your current perception of age-young, young-old, old, or old-old, and what are you using to measure age? What is your view when you meet people in each of these groups? Classroom Activity Develop three age range groups in your class and describe what you have in common with the people in your age group. The majority of people over 65 are intel- lectually intact and able to care for themselves (Fig. 21-1). Only about 0.4% of people over age 65 live in institutional setting such as2993_Ch21_335-352 14/01/14 5:29 PM Page 335nursing homes (Administration on Aging, 2011). These numbers are slowly on the rise as children of the 1950s and 1960s (often re- ferred to as \"baby boomers\") enter advanced age. Older people are usually basically men- tally healthy; that is, they are able to accept and deal with the changes and losses they are experiencing. Of course, many challenges are involved with aging. People aging normally may expe- rience a loss in visual and hearing acuity. Many of these individuals live on xed in- comes that are not adequate to meet their needs for housing, food, and health care. Safety is also an issue. Criminals are nding that older adults are easy targets and are rob- bing and mugging them in higher numbers than in generations past. For aging adults, the need to face death becomes more of a reality. Certain illnesses become more prevalent as one ages. Alzheimer's disease (see Chapter 16) may become more prominently manifested in an older person, rendering the individual in- capable of caring for himself or herself and possibly requiring a major lifestyle changes. This can include the individual's move to anursing home or to a family member's home. Coronary disease such as arteriosclerosis and respiratory disorders such as pneumonia occur more frequently in this age group, and pa- tients are less responsive to the treatments than younger people are. Older people are sicker longer. Nutrition is challenged. Elderly people may not be able to aord to buy nutritious foods, and the food they do prepare does not taste as it once did because their taste buds are less sensitive. It is essential that this aging group have all of their survival needs met. A phenomenon called ageism, which is oc- curring in the United States, is discrimination against a group of people on the basis of their age. It assumes that most older people are inca- pable of functioning in and contributing to so- ciety. What thoughts arise as one sees that the car ahead of him is being driven by an older per- son who can barely see over the steering wheel?336 UNIT 3|Special Populations Figure 21-1 Most older adults are indepen - dent and fully able to care for themselves. (Courtesy of Robin Anwar.) Classroom Activity Answer the following questions and share your responses to the questions with your classmates: How I will look at 75 years of age? Will I be independent? What will I be doing at 75? The retirement age has changed drasti- cally as a result of the economy and Social Security benefits. The expected age for re- tirement is currently 67 for people currently in the workforce to attain full retirement benefits. Those who have retired from their careers can live a comfortable life provided their retirement funds are adequate (U.S. Social Security Administration, Retirement Planner: Full Retirement Age, 2012). Whereas people now may conceivably change careers at least ve times during their working years, the elderly people of today most likely had one or two jobs over their life- time and worked 20-30 years at each job. That job probably represented a large part of the person's identity, and retirement may lead to feelings of low self-esteem and depression when the person has to redene who he or she is. Self-esteem is viewed as a need according to Maslow, and something that was sought after in youth and provides, prestige, and power (Green, 2000).2993_Ch21_335-352 14/01/14 5:29 PM Page 336Retirement also means a decrease in in- come, which can have a negative impact on a person's lifestyle. Today many elderly people have to make a choice whether to buy groceries or purchase their prescribed medication. The need for intimacy never leaves us. As human beings, the need to love and be loved is one of the primary needs for survival of the individual and the species (Fig. 21-2). As peo- ple age and spouses and friends die, who is there to love older people? Prospects for mar- riage are slim. Children and grandchildren may live on the opposite side of the country. In ad- dition, older adults may be forced to live with their adult children, which is not always the ideal situation. Older individuals are at risk for elder abuse (physical and emotional abuse of older people) by their children or caregivers. Elder abuse is discussed further in Chapter 22. Aging has many challenges, yet most indi- viduals are able to cope with the changes brought about by aging and progress through this life stage with dignity. They are proud of their families and their personal accomplish- ments. They can see the contributions that they have passed on to others. People who have learned to adapt to change throughout life have the best chances of progressing through old age with the same kind of resilience. Older adults with mental illness whether these were diagnosed earlier in life or are a new diagnosis face many challenges on top of the aging process. For example an elderly per- son with schizophrenia, generalized anxiety disorder, or a personality disorder will need added support as the person declines. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) is a federal act that provides standards of care for older adults. One of the provisions of OBRA is ensuring proper assess- ment of elderly people.CHAPTER 21|Aging Population 337 Figure 21-2 Pets can fulll the need for com- panionship and intimacy in an older person's life. (Courtesy of Robin Anwar.)Tool Box |Information About Elders and Mental Health Services http://www.asaging.org/blog/aca-could- bene t-elders-mental-health-problems- will-it It is for this reason that only registered nurses (RNs) may conduct or coordinate initial assessments of elderly individuals. The LPN/LVN role is to assist the registered nurse through active listening and competent ob - servation. This responsibility is especially im- portant in long-term care facilities since the role of the LPN/LVN is to administer routine and prn medications. Other health-care team members assist with the registered nurse's as- sessment by providing input as to the resi- dent's ability and responses to the treatment plan. OBRA also set the standards for provid- ing education for the majority of nurse's aides who are employed by long-term care facilities; the Department of Health and Senior Services regulates the curriculum. Nurses are caring for the older individual not only in the health-care facility but also in- creasingly in the privacy of the person's own home (Fig. 21-3). Multidisciplinary teams are Figure 21-3 Increasingly, nurses are caring for older adults in their own homes.

Because it is believed that people will stay healthier and maintain more control of their lives if they can stay in their own homes, the home health industry is growing. One of the primary con- cerns for nurses and others caring for older adults is to help them maintain a good quality of life. Nurses caring for patients in their homes need to be aware of some of the major mental and emotional disturbances they may encounter, as well as the physical diagnoses of the patient. The elderly are prone to a number of major disorders that impact their emo- tional well-being. These are covered in the next sections (Box 21-1). Alzheimer's Disease and Other Cognitive Alterations As stated in Chapter 16, when a person has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, it has most likely been taking its toll on the in- dividual for many years. It is in the later stages that the debilitating eects are most observ- able. This disease may necessitate the person's leaving the home she has lived in all of her adult life. It may mean living apart from a spouse whom she may not appear to remem- ber. Socializing will be curtailed because of the inability to relate to others easily. Alzheimer's disease has an impact not only on the patient but also on all the people in that person's life, which may include the health-care provider. Further information on Alzheimer's disease and the care of patients with this disorder is included in Chapter 16.Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke) A cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or stroke, is a medical disorder that has implications for mental health workers. A CVA is a devastating and frightening experience for the patient and family. The probability of a CVA in the elderly is higher. Depending on the location and size of the brain and blood vessel involvement, many physical and cognitive functions may be tem- porarily or permanently aected (Fig. 21-4). Some of the mental health issues associated with CVA are depression and aphasia. Depression Associated With CVA Patients realize the losses associated with their stroke. They may not be able to express them verbally or physically, but they do realize that they cannot do things independently. Self- esteem decreases as they realize they may be338 UNIT 3|Special Populations lBox 21-1 Some Concerns of Aging Adults Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive impairments Cerebrovascular (stroke) Depression Medication concerns Paranoid thinking Insomnia End of Life issuesLeft-side infarct Right-side infarct Right-sided weakness or paralysis Aphasia (in left-brain- dominant clients) Depression related to disability commonLeft-sided weakness or paralysis Impaired judgement/safety risk Unilateral neglect more common Indifferent to disability Figure 21-4 The location of a stroke is a key factor in the physical and cognitive functions that may be aected. A stroke on the left side of the brain aects the right side of the body; a stroke on the right side of the brain aects the left side of the body. (From Williams and Hopper (2011). Understanding Medical-Surgical Nursing, 4th ed. Philadelphia: F .A. Davis Company, with permission.)2993_Ch21_335-352 14/01/14 5:29 PM Page 338incontinent, unable to eat independently, or unable to communicate with their families. Depression may develop. They worry about the eect of their stroke not only on them- selves but also on their spouses and other fam- ily members. Will this be permanent or only temporary? Will it happen again? How long will I be this way? As these worries become more pronounced, the patient may become more depressed. The physicians, nurses, and therapists will try to explain these concerns to the patient and fam- ily, but the patient may still feel out of control of his or her destiny. Nurses may see the pa- tient crying and refusing to perform tasks that he or she could do after the stroke. The patient may avoid eye contact with the nurse or refuse to interact with family members. All these behaviors may indicate depression in the pa- tient who has had a CVA. By recognizing and confronting these behaviors, the nurse can help the patient understand that the nurse is really there to help and is concerned with the patient's thoughts and feelings. Being honest and generous with positive reinforcement for attempts to overcome the feelings of depression will also be helpful in building the patient's confidence and self- esteem. Aphasia Aphasia, a speech disorder that may be found in patients who have had a CVA, is classied as expressive, receptive, and/or global (see Chapter 2). A patient with aphasia may need to learn to talk all over again. Communication is such a basic need that the nurse and the pa- tient must work at any threat to this ability very diligently. The nurse should give the per- son time to speak, write, or show what is needed, and praise him or her for all eorts to communicate. One communication technique that is eective, especially in expressive aphasia, is to associate the object with the word. The more senses a person can engage, the better the reinforcement for the learning.The physician and speech therapist will de- termine the proper plan of speech therapy. Nurses need to closely follow this plan and document the patient's progress and emotional responses to speech therapy.CHAPTER 21|Aging Population 339 Patience is mandatory. The goal of communicating with a person who has aphasia is to keep him/her in- volved in the recovery.Neeb's TipCritical Thinking Question You are celebrating your retirement when the room goes dark. You wake up in a busy room with lights and noise and many people. You think you recognize some of them and you try to call out to them, but they just stand there and look at you. Someone you do not know is trying to say some- thing to you and keeps shining a flashlight in your eye. Your life partner is crying. What happened to you? Why is nobody answering you? What are you feeling now? What do you wish someone would do to help you? Depression in the Elderly It is not \"normal\" to feel depressed all the time despite the fact the person is getting older. Major depression in the elderly popu- lation can show itself dierently than in other age groups. In addition to the information discussed in Chapter 11, nurses observing and assisting elderly people should collect subjective and objective data for physical symptoms that can mask depression, e.g., confusion, constipation, headaches, and other body aches. Often these patients will discuss these physical symptoms rather than admit to being depressed. These symptoms are similar to other aic- tions common in the elderly population, such as drug side eects (Box 21-2), electrolyte imbalances, and dementia. Nurses must get accurate information, document it, and be certain that appropriate medical care is obtained to rule out other ailments. Clinical Activity During clinical preconference at a nursing home, determine how many residents have been diag- nosed as depressed. Develop a care plan that will address depression.2993_Ch21_335-352 14/01/14 5:29 PM Page 339Medication Concerns The process of pharmacokinetics is slower and less complete in older people. Because circu- latory, hepatic, and renal function start to de- crease normally with age, it is easier for these persons to become toxic. Adverse eects of many medications are more likely to develop in the elderly. Nurses who work in facilities that care for older adults must be very alert to the eects of the medications they give their patients as well as to the possible signs of side eects and toxicity. The nurse needs to report any concerns to his or her charge nurse imme- diately and document observations accurately. If the state allows a licensed practical nurse/ licensed vocational nurse (LPN/LVN) to con- tact the physician by telephone, the LPN or LVN will also take that responsibility. Patients who live at home may lose track of their medication routine. They may forget to take medications or forget they have taken them and take another dose. Many pills look alike. When visual acuity is lessened and lighting inadequate, patients may mistake one pill for another\u2014for example, they may take two lanoxin tablets instead of one lanoxin and one furosemide, especially if they put all of their medications in one container. These types of mistakes can be lethal. To help with this situation, nurses have systems available for teaching patients and families. Containers are available for planning which medications are taken at what time, enabling the nurse and patient to set up the patient's medications for a week or longer and for dierent times of day. If the patient is re- liable, this will serve as a reminder to take a particular dose. If the patient still needs some reassurance, the nurse can instruct the patientto immediately mark on a calendar the appro- priate date and time a dose is taken. In this way, the patient can double-check that the medications are taken correctly and will be less anxious about it. Also, new technology is available to create reminder alarms. Nurses also must be aware of the patient's weight, nutrition, and activity levels. It is very easy for older people to become toxic from their medications, regardless of whether they are at home or in a facility. Patients with drug toxicity or overdose can present with symp- toms similar to those of a mental illness or other physical illness. It is not uncommon for a proper dose of a medication for an older adult to be as little as 25% of the \"usual\" rec- ommended adult dose. It is the nurse's respon- sibility to ask specic questions of the doctor regarding medication doses. Similarly, side eects to medications can look like other symptoms. Nurses can teach patients and families about this possibility. Table 21-1 shows some of the common side eects of drugs on older people, disorders that may have similar symptoms, and some nurs- ing actions that can be taken and taught to the patient. Paranoid Thinking Paranoid thinking may be a result of fear about the social environment. As stated earlier, cer- tain people see elderly persons as \"easy marks.\" What was once a situation that was not threat- ening (such as a walk around the block) can become very frightening for the person who has slowed reaction time and diminished physical capacity for self-protection. Paranoid, fearful thinking can be a defense mechanism against these kinds of disabilities, making the fear the reason to avoid leaving the house. This self-imposed isolation can bloom into feelings of loneliness, which can lead to illness that is more serious. Validate what the person is expressing, even when it has taken the form of being paranoid. Investigate the person's fearful thinking. Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) and vision loss as well as early onset of demen- tia can all contribute to paranoid thinking. Paranoid thinking can also occur when a pa- tient is entering a long-term care facility and is exposed to new caregivers and a roommate.340 UNIT 3|Special Populations lBox 21-2 Common Drug Side Effects for Elderly Patients Dry Mouth Constipation Orthostatic hypotension Urinary complications Population 341 lTable 21-1 Common Drug Side Effects and Nursing Actions for Elderly Patients* Side Effect Other Possibilities Nursing Actions Dry Mouth Constipation Orthostatic Hypotension Urinary Irritability *Always report these side eects to the charge nurse, document carefully, and notify the physician if that is allowed for LPN/LVN practice in your state.Stress response; electrolyte imbalance Vitamin B deciency Fluid and nutritional deciency, hemorrhoids, or rectal pain Hypothyroidism Heart disorders Dehydration Prostate problems Bladder problems Uterus problems Urinary tract infections Cancers Hypoglycemia Head injury (e.g., fall) Infection/fever Depression Vitamin deciency Transient ischemic attack (TIA) Brain tumor Dehydration Alcohol and/or tranquilizer use Infectious process Anemia Hypothyroidism Stress Narrowing of coronary arteries Psychological disorders Electrolyte imbalances1.Oer sips of water or ice chips. 2.

Insomnia Insomnia, or inability to sleep, is seen fre- quently in the older adult. It can be a result of many conditions, including depression, fear,pain, urinary incontinence, napping during the day, or sometimes a condition nicknamed \"sundowner syndrome,\" in which the person turns around daytime and nighttime hours. These people sleep much of the day and are2993_Ch21_335-352 14/01/14 5:29 PM Page 341wide awake and active during the night. This syndrome is sometimes seen in patients who have Alzheimer's disease. Lack of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep from insomnia can have negative eects on anyone, even con- tributing to psychotic behavior. To someone with Alzheimer's disease or other cognitive problems, the eects of insomnia can intensify the symptoms of the cognitive disorder. The nurse needs to concentrate on keeping communication open with these patients. Nurses will need to be sure that they and their patients are using words in the same way. For instance, if the patient says, \"I do not sleep at night because I am worried,\" the word wor- riedshould be explored. What is the patient worried about? What can be done to elimi- nate the worry? How severe is the worry? Using a 1 to 5 rating scale, the nurse can more objectively document the impact of the \"worry\" on the patient. In addition, the nurse should ask the patient about his or her de- nition of not sleeping all night; perhaps the patient had taken naps throughout the night. End-of-Life Issues Life can end at any age; however, death is more common among the older population. Nurses who work in areas such as long-term care, home care, or hospice have a great opportunity to learn about and assist people with end-of-life issues. These opportunities also exist when working in acute hospitals and clinics. It may not be feasible for professional counselors to meet the needs of older adults dealing with these profound issues. Many people in this population will prefer the services of their own spiritual leader, but since the duties of many such leaders are overwhelm- ing, the appropriate clergy may not be available at the moment of immediate need. However, nurses are there, and they have all the tools needed to be the helpers. means to them. It is the nurse's responsibility and privilege to be able to help someone through this stage of life according to that individual's needs and wants. One issue a patient may experience is wid- owhood. The surviving spouse must learn to live independently or face an alternative form of housing. Finances and household chores may have been \"gender-specic\" in that relationship, and now the surviving person is forced to as- sume responsibilities formerly done by the de- ceased. The subjects of dating and working may become delicate issues for the survivor: Families may have strong opinions about what the newly widowed person \"should\" do. Nurses can play an advocacy role with widowed persons. Active listening skills, validating the person's thoughts and feelings, and oering information about various services available to widowed per- sons are skills that can be very helpful. Nurses can be eective in helping people through the dying process. Death of the body as everyone knows it is inevitable. People need to know it is \"OK\" to die. Elisabeth K\u00fcbler- Ross and others who teach about death and dying tell us that helping people to resolve life issues can help them to die with peace and dig- nity. Again, nurses who choose to work in hos- pice, home care, and long-term care settings have a special opportunity to be there for peo- ple at this very important stage of life. Using humor and laughter appropriately, maintain- ing the hope patients may still have, and reas- suring them that they will not be forgotten after death are some good techniques nurses can learn to use to help people prepare to die. Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross's ve stages of grieving continue to be taught and used in nursing pro- grams. Not everyone experiences each step nor in the order listed (K\u00fcbler-Ross,1969): 1.Denial 2.Anger 3.Bargaining 4.Depression 5.Acceptance Nurses must not ignore the incidence of suicide among the aging populations. This chapter has alluded to many losses that peo- ple are likely to face as they age. Compound the sadness of losing jobs, friends, and other 342 UNIT 3|Special Populations Nurses must take self-inventory of their beliefs surrounding the sub- jects of death and dying.Neeb's Tip It is also very important for nurses to dis- cuss and understand their patients' religious and cultural beliefs about what the end of life2993_Ch21_335-352 14/01/14 5:29 PM Page 342aspects of earlier life with physical illness and altered physical ability, and it may be- come clearer why some elders feel helpless or hopeless and opt for suicide. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, per- sons age 65 and older rate of suicide is higher than the national average for all age groups. They account for approximately 13% of the U.S. population, yet they accounted for 14.3% of all suicide deaths in the United States in the year 2007. The highest rates were found in white men age 85 and older. Follow the screening suggestions provided in Chapter 13 when considering the possi- bility that an older person may be at risk for suicide. Social Concerns Older adults, like younger adults, in today's world may nd themselves in nancial trou- ble. Many are facing nancial challenges liv- ing on xed incomes. Many exist only on Social Security benets. Retirement age has increased over the years, and politicians are discussing raising it yet again, potentially re- quiring people to continue working longer before they become eligible to receive the Medicare and/or Social Security benets they have earned. This will impact future genera- tions. Perhaps today's seniors have inadequate personal and supplemental insurance, so they will not seek medical help when they need it. They may nd their heat and power cut o due to inability to pay utilities on their xed income. Most municipalities are enacting laws and emergency funds to help avoid this life-threatening situation. Nurses can help provide the necessary information to help el - ders who are opting to remain at home or in assisted living. As baby boomers age, nurses will see a sig- nicant increase in this demographic they are caring for. The average age of patients will be older, and the concerns nurses face will relate more frequently to issues pertaining to people in the nal stages of life. It is worth mentioning again at this time that the family unit of the older population may have a dierent look as well. People are opting to have children later in life. Nurses maysee much younger family members than they might anticipate. The upcoming older genera- tion is very diverse. Those of varied ethnic and cultural backgrounds will be seeking assistance in long-term care facilities (Fig. 21-5). Nurses must be prepared to learn about older patients' customs, ask the proper questions upon intake data collecting, and be ready to oer care ac- cording to customs that may be dierent from their own and dierent from those they were trained in.CHAPTER 21|Aging Population 343 Figure 21-5 The demographic changes in the American population mean that a more ethnically and culturally diverse group will be seeking assistance in long-term care facilities. Nurses must be ready to oer culturally sensitive care. Classroom Activity Divide the class into ve groups. Each group represents a decade from the past 50 years. Each group should list the music, television shows, and fads popular during their assigned decade and add to a chart. Clinical Activity Using the chart developed in the classroom activity, ask your patients to provide more information about music, television shows, and fads they believed were popular during those times. One of the cultural demographics to con- sider is the group of elders who have lived a gay or bisexual lifestyle. Nurses need to antic- ipate issues surrounding grooming, room- mates, bathroom-sharing, family preferences, and potentially even a dierent denition of \"appropriate behavior\" for those with a 2993_Ch21_335-352 PM Page 343dierent lifestyle. Individuals may be reluc- tant to share this type of information unless nurses communicate acceptance. The nurse's role will need to become even more flexible. Nurses will need to be very open with their communication and with the type of ques- tions they must learn to ask in order to pro- vide the best care to all entrusted to their care. Nursing Skills for Working With Older Adults The following are some general skills a nurse should learn to use to more eectively work with the elderly population. 1.Respect: In the United States, a hand- shake is a sign of respect and coopera- tion. It is usually given at the beginning and ending of business meetings, and it is customary to shake hands at more formal social functions or when being introduced to someone new. Shaking the hand of an elderly patient will convey re- spect and cooperation and is an eective way to begin the nurse-patient partner- ship. There are citizens and residents of the United States whose culture does not participate in hand shaking, but this does not mean they lack respect for others. If you sense that shaking hands is not acceptable to that patient, then communicate to others that this action should not be used. Using the proper name of the patient also shows respect for that person. \"Mr. Washington\" or \"Mrs. Jones\" is the best way to address the patient. If the patient prefers, the nurse may call him or her by the rst name or the namethat the person is called socially. Nurses should not do this until invited to do so, however. Also, it is not acceptable to assign nicknames such as granny or honey arbitrarily to patients. In home care and long-term care, there is a danger of becoming too familiar. The facility becomes the residents' home, and they become friendly with each other. This informal atmos- phere sometimes spreads among the sta. This is a time when nurses must remember their professional role. They can be pleasant and friendly while still being professional.344 UNIT 3|Special Populations lBox 21-3 Skills for Working With Older Adults Respect Goal setting Patience and understanding Humor Safety Independence AcceptanceCritical Thinking Question You refer to an 87-year-old resident as \"grandmom,\" yet the resident does not have any children as a result of several miscarriages. Describe the emo- tional eect this title might have on the patient. It is important to remember that the elderly is a population of people who have been and still are produc- tive members of society.Neeb's TipUnder no circumstances should an older adult be treated as a child. As abilities dimin- ish and the older adult begins to become in- continent and loses the ability to feed and dress himself or herself, some caregivers take on a parental role. It can be easy to deal with an elderly person as one would deal with a child. Elderly patients have had careers and raised families. They are now adults who have special needs in order to help them maintain their adult dignity. 2.Goal setting: When preparing the plan of care with an older patient, nurses must remember to discuss goals that are measurable and attainable. Self-esteem and pride in one's accomplishments are as important when one is 80 as they were when one was 20. Success breeds success, and meeting small goals is an encourage- ment to the older person to attempt bigger goals. The patient will see that the nurse was there to help reach that goal and, again, the relationship will strengthen.2993_Ch21_335-352 14/01/14 5:29 PM Page 3443.Patience and understanding: Older patients who have some challenge to their physical or cognitive functioning may be slower to respond to verbal cues and may not be able to sprint down the halls at the pace that nurses generally travel. Be patient and recognize the care may take longer than expected. Plan for this. Nurses should convey the message that they have plenty of time (even though they may not). The patient who feels burdensome will be less likely to attempt activities or collaborate in the plan of care. He or she will be very sen- sitive to any nonverbal communication expressed by the nurses. It is important during these times that the nurse's ver- bal and nonverbal responses are congru- ent. It is therefore important to focus entirely on that person at that time. Acknowledge any accomplishment, however small. The focus should be on the residents' strengths and not their weaknesses. 6.Independence: The older adult should be allowed to perform without assistance as much as possible. Do not assume that the older person is unable to do things independently. Follow the guidelines on the patient's care plan. If the level of care is complete, then provide complete care. If the level of care indicates the patient needs partial or complete care, then honor those directions. This is one of the fallacies in long-term care: Too much focus is placed on the sta to provide care by a specic time and not on pro- moting independence. On the other hand, nurses should oer assistance as necessary. Nurses should let the patient know that they would like to help in whatever way they can. Because of the loss in hearing and visual acuity that often accompanies aging, nurses may need to arrange for adaptive equipment that can help the patient to maintain as much independence as possible with daily activities. 7.Acceptance: In rapidly increasing num- bers, people of diverse backgrounds and lifestyles are approaching the time of life that may require living in long-term care centers or assisted living communities. Those who will be caring for this diverse population must be in touch with their own thoughts and feelings about work- ing with groups of people and must be prepared to flex care to meet their needs. CHAPTER 21|Aging Population 345 Not everyone appreciates humor, and not everyone nds humor in the same things.Neeb's Tip 4.Humor: Humor that is appropriate to the age and condition of the patient will help smooth over some of the harder times for the nurse and the patient. Nurses should take their cues about humor from the patient. If the patient jokes about a situation, it is probably acceptable to go along with the humor. Never embarrass or make fun of the patient. Taking a situation in stride at the patient's suggestion, however, can be a very healthy mechanism for dealing with some of the hardships associated with aging. 5.Safety: Ensuring safety in the care facility and teaching safety to the patient who remains at home are very important. With vision, hearing, and other senses losing accuracy, it is easier for the older person to misjudge space, sound, and temperature. This could lead to falls, burns, and inability to hear the doorbell or the telephone ringing. Remember that humans are much more alike than they are different.Neeb's Tip Basic human needs as dened by Maslow and others are important for all groups of people. Table 21-2 summarizes some of the concerns of aging adults and techniques nurses can use to more eectively help this population. Restorative Nursing Restorative nursing is part of rehabilitation and focuses on maintaining dignity and achieving optimal function for patients and2993_Ch21_335-352 14/01/14 5:29 PM Page 345346 UNIT 3|Special Populations lTable 21-2 Concerns of Aging Adults and Helping Techniques Factors Associated With This Concern Concern Helping Techniques Alzheimer's Disease and Other Cognitive Impairments Cerebrovascular Accident (stroke) Depression Medication Concerns Paranoid Thinking InsomniaDebilitating eects are observable. Patients may need to leave the home they have lived in all of their adult lives; living apart from a spouse. Socializing will be curtailed. Physical and cognitive functions may be temporarily or permanently aected. Depression is evident. Aphasia may be present. Symptoms may be dierent from those in other age groups. Constipation; headaches, other pains, and fatigue may be indicators. Diculty breathing for which there is no diagnosis may occur. Pharmacokinetics is slower and less complete. Circulatory and renal function is decreased. It becomes easier for elderly people to experience side eects or become toxic. Patients who live at home may forget to take medications or forget they have taken them and take another dose. Visual acuity is lessened; patients may mistake one pill for another. Nurse should advise patient to maintain weight, nutrition, and activity levels. Fear about the environment Slowed reaction time and diminished physical capacity Feelings of loneliness and isolation Depression, fear, pain, urinary incontinence, napping during the day are common. Decreased REM sleep can contribute to psychotic behavior; insomnia can intensify the symptoms of cognitive disorders.Respect for the individual Realistic goal setting Maintaining patience and understanding Eective communication; allowing time for the patient to respond Appropriate use of humor Teaching and promoting safety Promoting independence See \"Alzheimer's Disease\" Allowing venting of emotions Assisting with communication techniques Allowing patient to verbalize; not automatically answering for patient See \"Alzheimer's Disease\" Allowing venting of thoughts and feelings Teaching about patient's medications Encouraging involvement in group activities as able Focus on positives Providing patient with information about medication Instructing patient to notify physician immediately if signs of side eects occur Allowing venting of feelings Not reinforcing the paranoid thoughts Speaking in terms of the \"here and now\" Provide aids for hearing and vision loss Discussing underlying feelings Teaching relaxation methods Encouraging patient to seek medical evaluation Discourage daytime napping Keep sleep diary2993_Ch21_335-352 14/01/14 5:29 PM Page 346residents (Fig. Some to restorative nursing as \"good, old-fashioned nursing care\"\u2014arguably a subjective state- ment, and likely related to the professional age of the writer. Goals include indepen - dence, promoting self-esteem for the patient, and allowing the patient to maintain as much control over his or her life and daily living activities as possible. Most skilled nursing facilities are required to provide at least one designated nursing as- sistant and nurse who are specially trained and part of the \"restorative\" team. They work in conjunction with physical therapy and re- habilitation departments to provide individ- ualized restorative exercise and training to assist residents to achieve their maximum ability. Restorative nursing is also part of a long- term care facility's documentation and reim- bursement requirements. State and federal surveys grade the facility on its restorative pro- gram. OBRA long-term care laws require that residents either maintain or improve their condition at the time of admission. Declinesin residents' condition that cannot be proven to be medically unavoidable are not allowed. Including restorative nursing care in a patient's care plan can prevent declines in condition that occur gradually, over time, such as loss of mobility, contractures, and loss of self-care ability. Restorative nursing is to be provided to any resident, regardless of his or her cogni- tive ability: The resident with dementia and the transitional care resident recuperating from knee surgery are equally in need of restorative nursing services. Palliative Care Palliative care is specialized care for people with serious illness that focuses on address- ing management of uncomfortable symp- toms and the stress of advanced illness. It is about keeping patients and families comfort- able and promoting the best quality of life that one can provide to someone facing an advanced illness. It is often associated with the last phase of life but it can begin earlier in the course of serious illness. Hospice is a specialized aspect of palliative care. Hospice care is specialized services for a patient with a terminal illness with less than 6 months to live. In addition to working with grief and bereavement with the patient and significant persons in that patient's life, nurses choosing to work in a palliative setting will need to be comfortable with issues such as pain, symptom management, sedation and opioid medication, artificial nutrition and hydra- tion, assisted suicide, and coordinating or providing complementary therapies. In ad- dition, nurses will need to sharpen their communication skills and be very cognizant of religious, cultural, ethical, and legal issues, especially surrounding an individual's wishes and advance care planning as the end of life approaches. It is widely documented that the preferred place of death of a patient is in his or her own home. Sometimes that is not possible. Because of that, many long-term care facilities are designing special units dedicated for pallia- tive care. Organizations such as The Center to Advance Palliative Care are attempting to show the need for hospital-based and out-patientCHAPTER 21|Aging Population 347 Figure 21-6 Restorative nursing is concerned with providing individualized restorative ex- ercise to help patients achieve maximum function and maintain their dignity. 2993_Ch21_335-352 14/01/14 5:29 PM Page 347palliative care, as well. Palliative care can be provided in the acute hospital, long-term care facilities, and in the home. Nurses are receiving special training and certification in this new specialty area. The good news is that LPN/LVN nurses are more than welcome into the fold. To en- courage LPN/LVN nurses to participate in palliative nursing, the Hospice and Pallia- tive Nurses Association (HPNA) has devel- oped a set of competencies that can be purchased online (see the Web sites list at end of this chapter). Certification as a hos- pice and palliative nurse (CHPLN) is also available.348 Tool |Information on certication for and palliative nursing is available at: www.nbchpn.org HPNA has a position statement on the value of the LVN/LPN in hospice and palliative nursing, which is available at http://hpna.org/D isplayP age.aspx ? Title= P osition Statements Key Concepts 1.The concept of old age is changing. People are living longer and better after age 65. Older patients are being cared for in facilities and in their homes. Diversity among aging persons is on the rise. Nurses must be prepared to flex the care required to provide the best care possible to many dierent groups of elders. Nurses have an active part in helping the patient maintain a good quality of life. 2.Normal conditions of aging include diminished hearing, vision, and other sensory acuity. Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive disorders are not consid- ered a part of normal aging. 3.Aictions aecting the older adult can be mental or physical, or a combination of these. Medication side eects and drug toxicity can share the same symp- toms as disorders that aect the elderly population. Accuracy of observation, documentation, and prompt reporting are crucial to a nurse's responsibility in caring for elderly people. Excellent communication skills are necessary. 4.Palliative care and hospice provide spe- cialized care for people facing advanced and terminal illnesses. CASE STUDY Mr. Jacobs is admitted as a new resident in your nursing home. He is 76 years old and has a diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF). He has fallen at home several times recently, and his adult children are con- cerned that he will become seriously in- jured. They have told him he needs to \"go there for a while until you get stronger.\" They tell the sta, condentially, that they plan this to be a permanent placement and will be selling Mr. Jacobs's home to pay for his care. Mr. Jacobs will be started on digoxin, furosemide, and potassium for theCHF and has an order for acetaminophen with hydrocodone for pain. Five days later, Mr. Jacobs has had a change in mood. His family comes to visit and nds that he is combative and forget- ful. One of his children is crying. She looks at you and says, \"What have you done to him? He's never been like this before.\" What thoughts cross your mind? How do you respond to the personal attack? How will you attempt to resolve this situation? How would you like to be treated if you were the family member?Tool Box |Palliative T raining Tools http://www.capc.org/2993_Ch21_335-352 14/01/14 5:29 PM Page 348REFERENCES Administration on Aging (2011).

The news, television dramas, and movies expose people to more violence than they did in the past. Violence in the workplace, road rage, and school violence are commonplace. Violence in the home is on the increase. Child abuse, domestic violence, and elder abuse are examples of family violence that take a terrible toll on society. All of these have tremendous negative eects. More than 50% of Americans have experienced violence in the family (Carson & Smith DiJulio, 2006). Abuse can take the form of physical, emotional, sexual, and economic abuse, as well as neglect.Physical abuse includes any action that causes physical harm to another person. Hit- ting; burning; withholding food, water, and other basic needs; and other activities that go beyond accidental contact are all considered physical abuse. A rule of thumb for dening the line between an accident and physical abuse is when the recipient says, \"Stop. You're hurting me,\" or something similar. If the ac- tivity stops and does not repeat itself, that be- havior may well have been just an accident. If the behavior persists, if the request to stop is ignored or mocked by the perpetrator, or if the activity is repeated in future situations, there is a strong chance that the perpetrator2993_Ch22_353-369 14/01/14 5:30 PM Page 353is guilty of abuse. Neglect can include failure to provide for the basic needs of someone who is dependent on the caregiver, e.g. a child, elderly parent. Emotional abuse can include verbal abuse, humiliation, excessive criticism, and lack of emotional support. Sexual abuse can include rape as well as any inappropriate sexual contact without consent. Victims are often too fearful or ashamed to report abuse, become adept at hiding the signs, and/or use massive denial to convince themselves that the abuse is not that bad. This contributes to the abuse cycle, which can go unnoticed by outsiders. Health-care professionals must be vigilant to recognize the overt and covert signs of abuse. Every state mandates that suspected child abuse be reported, and many states are enacting similar laws for domestic violence and elder abuse. The Joint Commission expects the accredited institutions to provide assessment of potential victims of abuse. Nurses are in a key position to identify and offer help to a potential victim. The Abuser The abuser is usually in a position of domi- nance or power over a potential victim. The following may cause a person to abuse another: History of being a victim: \"Violence begets violence. People\u2014especially to imitate what they see\" (Rubin, Peplau, and Salovey, 1993). That statement remains the belief of researchers today. It is accepted that (except in rare situations with a genetic or biological con- nection) violence, aggression, and abuseare learned behaviors. Children who grow up witnessing violence in the home and perhaps their community are sensi- tized to believe that this is the right be- havior, and they will very likely continue such actions into adulthood. Abusers retreat to these childhood memories and resort to abuse when they are stressed. They may never have developed skills to solve problems or deal with conflict. Rather, they learned that violence is the way to achieve a goal. Low self-esteem/need for power: Abusers often have a poor self-image. They feel frustrated and minimized as persons. They have poor interpersonal relationships and may not have had their ideas and accom- plishments validated by people important to them. Close relationships are dicult because others become afraid of the abuser. Therefore, they resort to physical, verbal, or emotional abuse of others in an attempt to bring a personal sense of power and importance to themselves. Sexual abuse is almost always not about sex; it is about conquering and winning. It is about demeaning another human being in order to feel a sense of strength. It is a short-term \"x\" for the abuser and a lifelong scar for the abused. The abuser may also be isolated and lack a support system in dealing with stress. Impairment from alcohol/substance use: Committing abusive acts while under the influence of a substance is a major contributor to violence. When a person's judgment is impaired and his/her ability to control impulses is altered, a person who is prone to these acts may abuse others. Easy access to weapons while impaired adds to the risk associated with substance abuse. Biological theories: Brain disorders, alteration in brain function, and genetic influences may also be factors in indi- viduals with a greater tendency toward violence. Other factors: The abuser may also be under stress (e.g., poverty) and have limited access to support resources to deal with problems, limited coping354 UNIT 3|Special Populations Cultural Considerations Abuse crosses all cultures, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. At times some be- haviors may appear abusive to us but are culturally appropriate. For example, there can be man's expectation of a wife's sub- servience in some cultures. This needs to be taken into consideration before assum- ing she is being abused.2993_Ch22_353-369 14/01/14 5:30 PM Page 354mechanisms to deal with conflict, and difficulty trusting others. How can an abuser be identied? Abusers may present with some of the following traits in connection with a victim: Inconsistent explanation of injuries of the victim Failure to show empathy for the victim Demand to take victim home and refusal of hospitalization for the injured victim Speaks for the victim Criticizes the victim Abuses family petsthey think and feel, or to speak out for what they need and want, may not be able to call up the strength they need to ward o an attack. They may be easily manipulated by the abuser into believing either that they deserved the attack or that the abuser is truly repentant and will not abuse again. They will begin to make up reasons to excuse the abuser's behav- ior and may accept the responsibility for the abuser's actions. 2.Reliance on the abuser: People who are re- liant on the abuser for nancial support as well as emotional and physical support are vulnerable to attacks from the abuser. This holds true for all age groups of peo- ple who are abused. See Table 22-1 for characteristics of vic- tims of child abuse, domestic violence, and elder abuse. Health-care professionals often see victims of abuse without realizing it. Patients who are abused may be fearful of sharing this information but may leave clues. Box 22-1 lists common warning signs of abuse. CHAPTER 22|Victims of Abuse and Violence 355 Because abuse in a family is often hidden, recognize that it can be dicult to identify an abuser.Neeb's Tip The Victim Though victims of abuse have a broad range of traits, the two most common include: 1.Low self-esteem: People who have not learned to be assertive and to say what lTable 22-1 Characteristics of Victims of Abuse Type of Victim Child; all ages, with greatest risk under age 4 (including infants) and for fatalities under 2 years of age Domestic/spouse/intimate partner ElderCharacteristics Self-blame for family conflict Low self-esteem Fear of parent or caretaker Cheating, lying, low achievement in school Signs of depression, helplessness One child sometimes singled out in family due to being labeled as \"dicult,\" product of unwanted pregnancy, reminds the parents of someone they dislike or even themselves, prematurity (inhibited parent-child bonding), chronic illness Low self-esteem Self-blame for partner's actions Sense of helplessness to escape abuse Isolation from family and friends Views self as subservient to partner Economic dependence on abuser Older than 75 years of age Mentally or physically impaired Isolated from others Female Source: From Gorman and Sultan (2008).

Davis Company, with permission.2993_Ch22_353-369 14/01/14 5:30 PM Page 355Categories of Abuse The most common categories of abuse include child abuse, sexual abuse, domestic violence (spousal abuse), and elder abuse. Child Abuse Child abuse includes physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, as well as neglect. It occurs at all socioeconomic levels. The U.S. Children's Bureau tracks reports of child abuse nation- wide and reported that 9.1 per 1000 children were reported as abused or neglected in 2011. Abuse includes neglect (75% reported cases), physical abuse (15% of reported cases), and sexual abuse (10% of reported cases). The youngest children (birth to 1 year) have the highest rates of victimization and those frombirth to 2 years have the highest death rate. Re- ported cases of child abuse have steadily in- creased over the last few years, but many cases are not reported. Children are a most vulnera- ble segment of the population because they de- pend on others for all their needs. Parents are the most common abusers (80% of reported cases). See Box 22-2 for signs of child abuse. Parents who abuse a child may have unre- alistic expectations of a child, such as being able to control crying or following instructions perfectly. Shaken baby syndrome is a form of child abuse that occurs when a caregiver shakes a baby in an eort to stop crying, which con- tributes to infant deaths each year (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010). Some- times a child with special needs or emotional problems is singled out for abuse as the parents' frustration tolerance is more severely tested.356 UNIT 3|Special Populations lBox 22-1 Common Warning Signs of Abuse Delay in seeking treatment for injuries, minimizing injuries History of being accident prone Pattern of injuries not accidental looking; for example, identical burns on bottom of feet, identi- cal injuries on both sides of head Multiple injuries in varying stages of healing Conflicting stories from victim and abuser about cause of injury Inconsistency between history and injury Unusual, even bizarre explanation for injuries Repeated visits to emergency rooms or clinics Previous report of abuse Patient reporting abuse Patient fearful of caregiver or partner Visits variety of doctors, emergency rooms for treatment to avoid a record of treatment Source: From Gorman and Sultan (2008).

Many states have passed laws for safe surrender sites of newborns if a mother is unable to keep her child. Rather than abandoning an infant through neglect, mothers can leave the infant at community locations that often include hospitals and fire stations. Many at-risk teenagers who might be pregnant are often not aware of this law, so community education that reaches teens in their com- munities must be provided to prevent ne - glect, abandonment, and often death of these infants. though the child may hate the abusive situa- tion, he or she never gets an opportunity to observe healthy parenting or to learn adaptive coping mechanisms to deal with frustration without violence. Other long-term eects of being a victim of child abuse include low self-esteem, high risk for substance abuse, ten- dency toward depression, diculty trusting in close relationships, and violent lifestyle in- cluding crime. Incarcerated youths frequently have a history of being abused and neglected.CHAPTER 22|Victims of Abuse and Violence 357 Figure 22-1 Maybe it's not your child who needs a time out. It is important to know the law in your state regarding safe surrender sites. This information must be dis- seminated to pregnant teens and other women. Neeb's Tip An early sign of child abuse in the victim can be changes in behavior and school per- formance. Another sign can be abuse of fam- ily pets by the child. Children may try to deal with the situation by controlling another being or seeking an outlet for their anger through a more vulnerable victim. Victims of child abuse are at an increased risk of becoming abusers as adults. EvenCritical Thinking Question A 4-year-old child with autism is admitted to your unit from the ER with burns on both hands and bruises on one arm. The child's parents are at the bedside and very concerned. They have told the doctors that the child reached up and put her hands in a pot of hot water on the stove. How would you react to these parents? Describe factors that might indicate this could be child abuse. Tool Box |National Child Abuse Hotline: 800 4 A Child Sexual Abuse Sexual abuse is violent or nonviolent sexual contact or sexual activity that is not wanted by the receiver. It is generally inflicted on someone the abuser considers less powerful physically or emotionally. The abuser is usu- ally a close, signicant gure in the abused person's life and knows how to manipulate the potential victim into submission. It can involve unwanted advances, inappropriate sexual contact, sexual harassment, and rape. Girls are the most frequent victims of childhood sexual abuse. Eighty percent of sex- ually abused children know their abuser, and about 50% of cases involve a parent or care- giver (Mulryan, Cathers, & Fagin, 2000). Long-term eects of sexual abuse include fear of intimacy, sexual problems, eating disorders, and an overwhelming sense of powerlessness. Children may feel threatened, be confused about their feelings, and question if this ac- tivity is right. The abuser is usually a trusted person initially to the child, which adds to the confusion. Children do not always have the2993_Ch22_353-369 14/01/14 5:30 PM Page 357words to express what is happening to them. They may also be so fearful that they say nothing. They may fear other family members will be hurt if they speak up. Victims may block out the memory of these incidents until later in life, when a major event or trauma triggers memory recall. Exploiting children in pornography has been increasing with access to the Internet and is another facet of sexual abuse. Signs of sexual abuse in children could include frequent urinary tract infections; torn, bloody underclothing; and sudden onset of sexually related behavior in addition to other signs of child abuse as listed above. Incest is dened as sexual activity between persons so closely related that they are forbid- den by law to marry. The most frequent occur- rence of incest is in girls under 18, although it can happen to persons of any age group (National Center for Victims of Violent Crimes, 2012). Rape is forcible, degrading, nonconsensual sexual intercourse accompanied by violence and intimidation. It often goes unreported. When a victim does seek medical care, most hospital emergency rooms and urgent care centers have rape kits to assist in proper col- lection of evidence such as sperm, hair, and other bers that may be compared with others to identify a suspect. It is important that the person who was raped not clean up before going to the emergency department. Although evidence must be kept intact, one of the victim's rst instincts is to \"wash away\" the incident both physically and psychologically by showering. Nurses should discourage that activity until evidence and DNA sources can be collected. Date rape (also known as acquaintance rape) most frequently occurs among teens and young adults. An alarming reality in the United States is that rape happens to elderly people. That population is often assaulted in their private residences and in long-term care and assisted living facilities. Domestic Violence Domestic violence takes many forms, in- cluding physical, emotional, sexual, and economic abuse. Domestic violence is also called spousal or intimate partner abuse or violence. One in every four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime (CDC, 2010). Domestic violence can in- volve physical injury, use of intimidation, denigration, and control, which can include restricting access to family finances. Though most often domestic abuse in- volves women, men can also be victims. They may be less prone to report it out of embarrassment, so the frequency of this is less known. This type of abuse often incorporates the children. For example, an abusive domestic partner might say, \"If you go out with your friends tonight, I'll see to it that your kids are taken away; you're unt to be their mother (father) if you go out at night and leave them. You do not deserve them!\" Or \"Leave, and when you get back the kids and I will be gone and you won't see them again!\" The children are used as a way to control and in- timidate. This type of button pushing is very eective at negatively controlling someone's behavior out of fear of the consequences. Abusers also use the family pet as a means to control; for example, \"I will kill the dog if you leave me.\" Pediatricians and veterinarians receive training on identifying signs of domestic violence since they may observe clues of a troubled family. In a 2001 study of women visiting a pediatric clinic, researchers found that more than 16%, or 553 mothers, had been physically abused at some point in their lifetime. The researchers strongly encourage screening for domestic violence as part of the oce intake protocol (Parkinson, Adams, & Emerling, 2001).358 UNIT 3|Special Populations Clinical Activity Ensure that appropriate tests are completed as part of the workup for victim of sexual abuse (e.g., screening for STIs or sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy test, HIV test).Critical Thinking Question The nurse from the local grammar school calls your clinic asking for help. She tells you a parent of a 6-year-old has accused the teacher of sexually molesting her child. The nurse does not know what to do. What would be your rst action?2993_Ch22_353-369 14/01/14 5:30 PM Page 358The abuse cycle in domestic violence has been shown to follow a pattern that was originally identified by Walker in 1979. 1.T ension-building: The recipient of the abuse is compliant, believing that in some way he or she is at fault and deserves the abuse. These individuals remain accepting and continue to be supportive even though they know the behavior is inappropriate. The victim is probably using denial as a defense mechanism. The perpetrator is using verbal abuse and minor beating, and also is aware that the behavior is not appropriate. 2.Acute battering incident: The victim senses that the beating is coming and may even provoke it to get it over with. Some triggering event occurs, which may be something minor like a miscom- munication or dropping a dish. The vic- tim may try to hide and will probably not seek help until the next day, if at all. The police may be called, but by the time they arrive, the victim may have already forgiven the perpetrator. This kind of physical abuse usually happens in private. 3.Honeymoon: The perpetrator is contrite, loving, and very sad about the incident of abuse that has occurred. He or she may well try to make amends with gifts. The abuser promises to get help but only after discussing how the abuse has taught the other a lesson, such as \"Don't make me mad!\" The victim wants desperately to believe this, will forgive the perpetra- tor, and will begin to think that the rela- tionship will return to \"normal.\" The victim is still very much in love with the perpetrator and believes this love will conquer all and the abuse will stop. This cycle of domestic violence leads to the often-asked question: Why does a victim of domestic violence stay in the relationship? Some of the most common reasons for stay- ing include: Fear of retaliation for self or children Fear of loss of custody of children Dependent nancially on the abuserLack of support; does not know where to go if he/she left abuser Religious beliefs; will not consider divorce Denial; thinks of the good times and hopes that things can improve so there can be good times againCHAPTER 22|Victims of Abuse and Violence 359 Critical Thinking Question Your pregnant patient has been admitted with a broken ankle from a fall. When you walk into the room, the woman is crying on the phone telling someone she is sorry and it will not happen again. What would be your rst action in response to hearing this? Because it is common that a woman may return to a domestic violence situation, sta need to understand they cannot push a patient to leave the abuser. It has to come from the victim. It may take multiple episodes before the patient is able to leave.Neeb's Tip In assessing for domestic violence, some signs that a patient might be a victim include: injuries while pregnant when there is resent- ment of a pregnancy, wearing clothes and makeup to cover up injuries, lack of care for own chronic illnesses, social isolation, use of alcohol or drugs to cover hurt, acting guilty for seeking medical treatment, and history of rape. Sutherland, Fantasia, Fontenot, and Harris (2012) recommend the following questions be incorporated in screening for intimate partner violence. 1.Have you ever been abused or threatened by your partner? 2.In the past year, have you been physically hurt by someone? 3.Have you ever been forced to have sex? Tool Box |National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1_800_799_SAFE(7233) Elder Abuse Elder abuse includes neglect as well as physi- cal, sexual, and emotional abuse. Exploitation of the person's nancial reserves by family, hired help, or strangers is economic abuse2993_Ch22_353-369 14/01/14 5:30 PM Page 359(sometimes called duciary abuse) . Elder abuse can occur in the home or in residential facilities. Elder abuse aects 10% of the geri- atric population. (National Center on Elder Abuse, 2013; Gray-Vickrey, 2000). This prob- lem is greatly underreported and will continue to increase as the population grows older. One problem in reporting it is the incon- sistency of laws dening elder abuse. Some states do not include neglect, psychological abuse in their denition, so it is essential for nurses to be aware of how elder abuse is dened in the state where they are working or reside. Because the abuser is often the victim's caregiver, even including the elderly spouse, victims rarely report the abuse. They fear reprisals or abandonment because they are dependent on the caregiver. Society's lack of interest in elderly people may add to the underreporting. Caring for a loved one with a cognitive impairment increases a caregiver's risk for engaging in abusive behaviors (VandeWeerd, Paveza, & Fulmer, 2005). Caregivers with no history of being an abuser can reach a point of frustration and fatigue that leads to behav- iors they would normally nd unacceptable, such as slapping or degrading their loved one. Elder abuse can also be dicult to detect by professionals because common signs such as bruising and skin tears may be common in older populations. The patient with dementia is particularly vulnerable because he or she is unable to speak up or will not be believed be- cause of his or her intermittent confusion.Caregivers of dementia patients should be counseled about dealing with the stress of this role. They need to be given resources for support and respite care. Local programs such as through the Alzheimer's Association or local senior centers may offer support groups and caregiver resources to help pre- vent elder abuse. Specific examples of elder abuse can include: Hitting Shoving Social isolation Leaving in soiled linens Withholding food/water Inappropriate restraints Threats Being forced to sign over nancial aairs, change a will Sexual molestation Insulting See Box 22-3 for the characteristics of victims and abusers in elder abuse.360 UNIT 3|Special Populations Economic or duciary abuse can be evidenced when a patient gives hired caregivers liberal access to personal nancial information. It is important to determine that the patient is doing this voluntarily and is competent to make reasonable decisions.

The immediate crisis intervention may include getting out of the abusive situation. Some strategies for crisis intervention that your agency may arrange include: help in providing a domestic violence shelter, ar- ranging respite care for an overwhelmed caregiver of a child or elderly parent, imme- diate social work referral for options if patient cannot return home, and contacting law enforcement. Domestic violence shelters or safe houses are available in major cities where women can bring children and even pets and be protected from the abuser. The locations of these shelters are confidential so the victim can feel safe.

You visit your 90-year-old patient in her home. The daughter, who is the caregiver, is not home. The door to the house is unlocked and the patient is tied in bed with a restraint. You call your super- visor, and the daughter walks in as you are on the phone. The daughter is frantic and tells you she had to leave for a while to buy groceries. She had no one to watch her mother. What ac- tions should you take? Should this be reported as elder abuse? Classroom Activity Research the elder abuse laws in your state. Identify resources for caregivers of dementia patients in your community.

For example, victims may have their computers and cell phones tracked by a suspicious abuser. Anyone who is sexually abused may need testing for sexually transmitted infec- tions, HIV, and pregnancy. Children and teens also need evaluation for substance abuse if they were exposed to drugs as part of the abuse. Children exposed to sexual abuse need access to specialists in the field. Repression of trauma can lead to a lifetime of emotional problems, so therapy is very important. Play and art therapy can be im- portant tools for children to communicate their feelings. Abusers and victims need specialized coun- seling programs as well as access to support resources such as local and national hotlines. Ongoing individual and group psychotherapy is often part of the treatment plan for both as well. Mandated therapy for abusers who are convicted of crimes may be part of their rehabilitation. T reatment for abusers can in- clude resources for parenting skills and anger management. Nursing Care of Victims of Abuse Common nursing diagnoses for the victims of abuse include the following: Anxiety Caregiver role strain Family coping, disabling Parenting, impaired Post-trauma response Powerlessness Violence, risk for General Nursing Interventions 1.Ensure safety: The survivor of abuse will be confused and fearful. The nurse needs to reassure the patient that every- thing possible is being done to ensure his/her safety. Social work involvement is essential. The nurse should obtain a list of people who are considered \"safe\" by the patient, and ask if the patient would like those people to be called. If the patient wishes to press charges, offer assistance with making the appro- priate phone calls. Call for assistance from a physician and counselor if none is in the immediate area. Alert security staff members according to agency protocol to prevent the alleged abuser from causing more harm. Maintain a calm milieu. If the abuse victim is a young child or frail elder who cannot speak for himself or herself, immediate involvement of the interdisciplinary team is essential to determine the next steps. Providing a safe, calm, secure en- vironment will reassure the patient. 2.Know your own thoughts and feelings about abuse: The nurse is responsible for helping the patient through this initial362 UNIT 3|Special Populations Tool Box |Parents Anonymous is a national organization for parents with issues around child abuse.

Pharmacology Corner Victims of abuse may need medications for anxiety and depression. Both victims and abusers may have issues around substance abuse. Abusers may need medications to manage substance abuse, control angry im- pulses, and manage anxiety. Victims of abuse may seek out drugs or alcohol to self-medicate feelings of fear, anxiety, and shame. Sub- stance use may be the initial symp- tom that brings the victim to a health-care provider. Neeb's Tip2993_Ch22_353-369 14/01/14 5:30 PM Page 362horrifying experience. A nurse who has been abused or who has been an abuser may nd it dicult to be therapeutic for the patient. Nurses should remember that they may be treating the survivor as well as the abuser. Nurses are responsible to help all patients. Abusers are in need of help as much as the person who is abused. It is worthwhile to mention that nurses face stressful situations daily. Nurses must also be aware of their own safety and avoid putting themselves in a risky situation if a potential abuser threatens violence to someone reporting the abuse.with abuse and violence. Familiarity with these policies and procedures will help save time and convey condence. The patient may be confused and embar- rassed about the situation. It may well have taken every bit of courage the per- son had just to get to the facility. The nurse's smooth handling of the situation may provide the extra bit of condence the victim needs to actually go through with the examination. Collection of physical evidence, observations, and screening questions may be part of the nurse's role in potential abuse cases. In most jurisdictions, with the exception of persons legally classied as \"vulnerable,\" notication of police, taking of pictures, etc., may only be done with the patient's consent. Many hospitals and trauma centers have some sort of abuse-advocacy program. A rep- resentative should be contacted immediately to visit the victim. The abuse program repre- sentative will be able to oer support and provide information on safe houses and other services that may be available to the victim and his or her children. Nurses who are caring for a survivor of abuse need to be aware of their state's law regarding children who may have witnessed the abuse. In some states, a child who sees or hears abuse is also considered to have been abused. Nurses and other health-care providers are most likely mandated reporters and, as such, find themselves in an ethical bind: They want to help and support the patient/survivor; however, they must tell that individual that if a child saw or heard the abuse, the nurse must, as a mandated reporter, report this fact to the child protec- tion agency. The patient/survivor may be forced, in a sense, not to divulge the whole situation to the nurse. The physician or counselor will discuss treatment options with the survivor and the abuser. Legal counsel may be requested as well. A law enforcement agency may be present also. Nurses now can take a more advocacy-oriented role for the patient. Be supportive.CHAPTER 22|Victims of Abuse and Violence 363 Suspecting someone of abuse can lead to stress for the health-care team. It is important to have a team plan of care when working with a potential abuser. One nurse should not carry all the burden of this di- cult situation. Seek out support from coworkers.Neeb's Tip 3.Remain nonjudgmental/show empathy: This is a crisis situation in many ways. Recalling communication skills and helping the patient to verbalize any concerns, thoughts, and feelings are crucial. Remaining technically correct in performing any procedures or sample collections is imperative to avoid con- tamination. Maintaining professional- ism and confidentiality for both the survivor and the abuser is mandatory. Calling for help from counselors, advocates, or people chosen by the pa- tients will help maintain a calm milieu. Nurses are not expected to condone or accept the action but to respect and help the person, regardless of the situa- tion. If a patient who may be a victim wishes to return home with a possible abuser, the nurse can offer support, education, and resources but cannot force a patient into different actions. 4.Know your agency policy and use your resources: Every health-care agency has its own policies and procedures for dealing2993_Ch22_353-369 14/01/14 5:30 PM Page 363See Table 22-2 for a nursing care plan for a child who may be the victim of abuse.

Key Concepts 1.Abuse takes many forms and is being re- ported in higher numbers annually. 2.Victims of abuse are often in a vulnerable position to their abusers, who may have the need to exert power and control. 3.Abuse happens in all age and socioeco- nomic groups. Men can also be victims, though this is believed to be underre- ported. The youngest children are the most vulnerable to abuse. 4.Nurses must be sensitive to the needs of the abused person as well as those of the abuser. Careful attention to physical assessment, communication, and emotional support are components of nursing care for people who are suf- fering the effects of abuse. 5.The nurse has a responsibility to know state laws regarding one's obligation to report evidence of child abuse, domestic violence, and elder abuse.2993_Ch22_353-369 14/01/14 5:30 PM Page 366CHAPTER 22|Victims of Abuse and Violence 367 CASE STUDY 1.What are your responsibilities according to your facility?

Test Questions cont.2993_Ch22_353-369 14/01/14 5:30 PM Page 369370APPENDIXA Answers and Rationales CHAPTER 1 History of Mental Health Nursing 1. b. The main goal of deinstitutionalization was to allow as many people as possi- ble to return to the community and lead as normal a life as they could. Not all mentally ill people would be able to do that because of the severity of their illnesses. On the other hand, not all mentally ill people had to be kept in locked units, nor do they today. Com- munity hospitals were to be kept open, but many state hospitals closed be- cause of the decline in census. 2. c. The development of psychotropic (psychoactive) medications in the 1950s was a keystone to allowing people to return to their homes. The Commu- nity Mental Health Centers Act came about 10 years later. The Nurse Prac- tice Act dictates the scope of practice for nurses; and electroshock therapy, now called electroconvulsant therapy, took place in hospitals. 3. d. The Nurse Practice Act, which is writ- ten specically for each state, is the set of regulations that dictates the scope of nursing practice. The NLN and the ANA are national nursing associa- tions that set recommendations for the practice, education, and well-being of nurses. The Patient Bill of Rights is a document to protect the patient. Nurses must know the parameters of this document for ethical practice, but it does not dictate the scope of nursing practice.4. d. Deinstitutionalization and changes in the health-care delivery system en- courage people with mental health is- sues to be treated in a variety of health-care settings. Nurses will care for patients with mental illnesses in all of the settings listed. 5. d. Dorothea Dix is the only one on this list who is not a nurse. 6. b, d, e. AAPINA represents Asian American and Pacic Islander nurses; PNAA represents Philippine nurses; NANAINA represents Alaska Native American Indian nurses. 7. b. Asylums were originally described as places of refuge. The meaning is much dierent today. 8. d. The National Institute of Mental Health was established in 1946. 9. c. Florence Nightingale recognized the relationship between sanitary condi- tions and healing. 10. a. Phenothiazines were the rst psy- chotropics drugs introduced in the 1950s. CHAPTER 2 Basics of Communication 1. b. This option oers assistance in a way that encourages the patient to say what he or she needs. Option A used the word \"why,\" which has negative conno- tations. C is closed-ended and allows a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. D is also closed- ended. Adding the \"please\" does not make it a correctly formatted question.2993_App-A_370-386 14/01/14 5:14 PM Page 370APPENDIX Nurse-patient communication is pur- poseful and helpful. Option A would change the focus of the nurse-patient relationship and lower the chances for a successful therapeutic relationship. Sometimes nurses and patients do become friends, but this cannot get in the way of the professional relation- ship of the nurse to the patient. B sug- gests that the nurse is somehow \"the boss.\" Patients sometimes have that perception, but the nurse is really a \"partner\" in collaboration with the patient. D suggests a distance that would place the nurse too far from the patient emotionally. It would be dicult to discuss some of the inti- mate details the patient needs to dis- cuss if the relationship is too distant and formal. 3. c. This option combines an observation with a closed-ended question. In this instance, it can be eective. Even with the closed-ended question, it is the best of the four choices. Option A im- plies playing into a hallucination and assumes that the patient intends to be talking to someone else. B is intended to quiet the patient by using guilt. Asking the patient to be quiet will dis- courage the patient from wanting to conde in you. D uses the word \"why\" without prefacing it with an observa- tion, thus opening up the possibility of the patient's feeling defensive. 4. d. This option honestly tells the patient that you cannot give that information. The physician must explain the results rst. Option A oversteps the bound- aries of the nurse. B uses the \"why\" word. C gives advice, by using the word \"should.\" 5. c. This puts the conversation back to the patient and allows venting of concerns. Options A and B give advice; D gives false reassurance and also belittles the patient's concerns. 6. a. This is correct because it tells the patient the nurse is concerned yet leaves the patient responsible for stating what he or she needs at the moment. B uses the word \"why,\" and C has a very authoritarian tone. D is a command that is very authori- tarian and even threatening. 7. a. Here, the nurse tells the patient that he or she understands the special con- cerns of the religion and culture of Judaism but does not make a promise that the dietitian will come, which would build false hope. Option B is incorrect because it does make that promise. C does not give any indica- tion that compromise is possible or that the nurse is \"hearing\" the true concern. D is agreeing and is a block to therapeutic communication. 8. d. This is stating an implied thought or feeling. The nurse is checking out the fact that the patient is feeling ignored. Option A makes light of the patient's concern to see the physician. B is not helpful for the patient and shows no sensitivity for the patient's desire to see the physician. C is a block because it shows disapproval for the patient's concern and sides with the physician rather than the patient. 9. a. This option is more correct than B because it oers an observation be- fore using a closed-ended question. B and C are simply closed-ended questions. D is an observation, but it uses \"why,\" which tends to leave people feeling defensive. 10. b. \"I feel like\" is not a \"feeling\" state- ment at all, but rather a thought statement. There is no emotion identified. Option B encourages the nurse and patient to explore what emotional response is being experienced by the patient in a safe environment. Options A and C are nontherapeutic techniques. Option D is nontherapeutic in many ways: changes the subject, does not reflect what the patient has said, and im- plies the nurse is not interested in pursuing the patient's feelings.2993_App-A_370-386 14/01/14 5:14 PM Page 371372 APPENDIX A|Answers and Rationales CHAPTER 3 Ethics and Law 1. b. Ethics is a code of professional expec- tations that does not have legal force behind it. The issues border on legal implications, but ethics comes more out of expectations that patients have of nurses than out of actual legal bounds. 2. c. Each state has a Nurse Practice Act that denes the scope of practice for RNs, LPNs, and LVNs in that state. 3. d. The Patient Bill of Rights is designed to dene the rights of all patients in health-care facilities. These will change somewhat from state to state. People who are institutionalized for some reason may be termed \"vulnerable\" because they may be unable to speak for themselves or provide for their own safety. All who care for people in these facilities must treat them in accordance with the Patient Bill of Rights. 4. b. This is an honest, assertive technique that shows one nurse voicing a con- cern to another nurse. Options A, C, and D are all forms of blocks to thera- peutic communication. 5. d. Most Nurse Practice Acts require that LPNs follow the chain of command. In this situation, speaking with the nurse in charge is the best choice. Option A is a block to therapeutic communication because it is argumen- tative and voices disagreement with the patient. B is not safe: Even though it is always important to listen to pa- tients, a nurse must never assume the patient is right. C is inappropriate at this time; it must rst be determined that an error has occurred. Once this is established, the RN or the LPN, if allowed by state and/or agency policy, should inform the physician. 6. c. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act allows patients to have a greater say in how their records are shared and with whom. It also has regulation relating to other areas of condentiality and how les are shared among providers. It does not force anyone to treat in a particular facility, but it would raise questions about transporting records in per- sonal vehicles, etc. 7. b. Oer another pain relief technique. Mr. Ouch does have the right to re- fuse medication. He also has the right to privacy, but the option pro- vided borders on punitive and may be a threat to patient safety. It is also appropriate to discuss acceptable be- havior and the eect he is having on the other residents\u2014just not now. Wait for a time when he is reasonably comfortable and willing to negotiate treatment. Bringing in more sta and performing an invasive technique is not only threatening, but it violates many of the Patient Bill of Rights. 8. c. The LPN/LVN works under the direction of the registered nurse or physician and cannot order medica- tion independently. It is not accept- able practice for the LPN/LVN by the Nurse Practice Act. 9. c. It is the LPN/LVN's responsibility to contact his/her supervisor. 10. c. Mr. B should have received a copy of the Bill of Rights. The nurse can re- view to which right the patient is re- ferring and discuss why he felt his rights have been violated. CHAPTER 4 Developmental Psychology Throughout the Life Span 1. d. This patient is demonstrating the Electra complex, which is part of the phallic stage of Freud's developmental stages. 2. c. Unsuccessful completion of the anal stage would lead to these behaviors and to more serious disorders, ac- cording to psychoanalytic theory. These people would be termed \"anal2993_App-A_370-386 5:14 PM Page 372APPENDIX some social and profes- sional circles today. 3. d. This option states that Y's behavior is not appropriate and lets Y tell you that the consequences have been discussed. Y is able to make a choice. Options A and B sound harsh and threatening and are not helpful forms of commu- nicating. C is very close to letting the nurse \"care-take\" for Y. In behavior modication, Y would most likely be responsible for his or her own actions and choices. 4. a. Cell dierentiation, the process whereby cells \"specialize\" into their particular type, is generally complete by the end of the rst trimester (third lunar month). 5. d. Women are successfully having chil- dren at young ages; however, it is generally believed that a woman's body is not completely mature until the age of 18 years. Because the young woman's body is not completely ma- ture, it is dicult to sustain her health and the life of the fetus. Therefore, in- fant mortality as well as danger to the mother's health is greatest before this age. Older women are next in line as a risk group for infant mortality be- cause of changing hormones that can jeopardize the woman's ability to sup- port a fetus and carry it to term. Cer- tainly, there are exceptions in both of these age groups regarding preg- nancy and successful delivery. These are broad, general beliefs that are held among many in the medical and nurs- ing community. 6. b. Option A describes \"animus,\" the balance to the female, according to Jung. 7. d. According to Erikson, the stage or task for children in the 3- to 6-year-old group is the stage or task of \"initia- tive.\" The stage or task of \"industry\" (the stage at which integration of life experiences or the confusion of those experiences develops) covers ages 16-20 years. \"Intimacy\" (the stage at which the main concern is developing intimate relationships with others) begins at approximately age 18 and continues through approximately age 25. 8. c. It is believed that infants develop in a very similar rate and pattern (physi- cally, behaviorally, and cognitively) until the age of 10 months. Again, this is based on generalizations; there are always exceptions (e.g., a child who is longer than most of his or her particular age group because of the gene pool from parents who are taller than the average). 9. b. Assimilation is the process of taking in and processing information. It is generally learned by experiencing through the senses. \"Accommoda- tion\" is the process of working with the information that has been assimi- lated and making that information a working part of the toddler's daily life. \"Autonomy\" is the stage or task Erikson believes a toddler should be achieving. \"Adjustment\" is a general term related to change. It is not always a healthy response to change. 10. d. According to Jean Piaget, the 2-year-old child is in the preoperational stage, where the child is demonstrating interest in something other than parents. CHAPTER 5 Sociocultural Influences on Mental Health 1. b. Proxemics, or spatial distances vary among the cultures. What is comfort- able and appropriate for some is not appropriate for others. 2. c. Prejudice means to \"pre-judge.\" It is making a decision about a person, situ- ation, etc., prior to having all necessary information. 3. b. Homelessness is not a mental illness but may be a condition of mental 2993_App-A_370-386 14/01/14 5:14 PM Page 373374 APPENDIX is dicult for this popula- tion of people to access the health-care and community services available. 4. b. Approximately one-third of the home- less in the United States are mentally ill. 5. d. Enlist the assistance of a religious rep- resentative to negotiate removal of the item(s) in question. Other safety ac- tions may also be required, but right now, relating to this individual at his or her spiritual level is necessary not only for the patient's religious freedom of expression, but also to get him or her to be able to cooperate with addi- tional nursing actions. 6. d. Actually, all of the responses are cor- rect. Nurses are mandatory reporters for suspected abuse/neglect/endan- germent of children. Certainly, the child could ultimately die from un- controlled diabetes. It is appropriate to call the RN and MD to the exam room, but a stat call would not be necessary. You are there: The best choice is to sit with the family for a time, gain their trust, and collect more information that could be used to modify the care plan or as- sist the MD in appropriate referrals for the best care of this child and family. 7. b, c, d. Many homeless fall into the \"work- ing poor\" category and are actually working full-time jobs. Approxi- mately one-third of the homeless also have a mental illness, quite often schizophrenia. 8. a, c, e. Though mental illness is a com- mon cause of homelessness, the economy and loss of assets from health-care expenses has been contributing factors for some. 9. d. Ethnicity is dened by a personal trait or common characteristics relat- ing to a specic group of people. 10. d. Authoritative parenting focuses on the setting of rules and limits setting by the child.CHAPTER 6 Nursing Process in Mental Health 1. a. Nursing process is a systematic way of collecting data to have consistency in patient care. Options B and C are incorrect, even though nurses do document patient needs and RN and LPN/LVN roles are dierent in the nursing process. Patient needs are not usually documented as part of the nursing process per se. D is incorrect because the nurse needs to know the dierence between medical and nurs- ing care prior to writing the nursing process. Only nursing care is incorpo- rated into the nursing process. 2. c. This is the best choice of those listed. It asks what you need to know, but it asks from the patient's perspective. It is less judgmental than the other choices. 3. b. Return demonstration (redemonstra- tion) is the best method for evaluating the patient's learning. Option A is a method of teaching. C and D are steps in the nursing process and steps in developing a teaching plan. 4. a. Mental status examinations are made as part of the assessment or data col- lection part of the nursing process. 5. a, b. Planning is the third component in the Nursing Process. In the planning process the nurse plans measurable and realistic goals, both for long and short term. 6. a. The registered nurse initiates the nurs- ing diagnosis from the patient's data collection or assessment. The LPN/ LVN can assist in this step. 7. a, b, d. The principle of teaching enhances the patient's understanding of the nurses' rationale for the specic interventions in their care. 8. a, b, d, e. Tone is not part of the mental status exam. 9. d. The North American Nursing Diagno- sis Association (NANDA) is a universal 2993_App-A_370-386 14/01/14 5:14 PM Page 374APPENDIX A|Answers and Rationales 375 and systematic approach in dening a person's needs according to his/her assessment using nursing diagnosis. 10. d. Formal teaching occurs when the patient is ready. The nurse can then prepare a teaching plan. The nurse will also schedule a specic time for teaching and feedback of the learned information. CHAPTER 7 Coping and Defense Mechanisms 1. c. Rationalization is the defense mecha- nism that sounds like \"excuses.\" 2. a. Denial is the refusal to accept situa- tions for what they really are. This is a classic example of denial. 3. d. This child is using compensation, which is nding some other strength that will make up for a real or imag- ined inadequacy. 4. d. He is \"blaming\" his wife for his actions rather than taking responsibility for his thoughts, feelings, and actions. 5. a. Rationalization. Certainly, eating a meal of burgers and fries does not depict mental illness. Even though the person may be joking, and there is an element of truth, this statement depicts an \"excuse\" for one's behavior and choice of menu selection. 6. b. Undoing. This is a tricky one. Many may have chosen C, Symbolization. The reason this would be more likely an example of \"undoing\" is because Tara is trying to make up for a nega- tive behavior that aected her daugh- ter. While words have not been spoken, there is not really an \"emo- tion\" that is being represented, as would be the case in symbolization. Rather, Tara seems to be oering the tickets to \"undo\" the embarrassment she caused her daughter by her drunk and inappropriate public behavior. 7. a, c, d. Shirley is returning to a time when her stress level was minimal.Posing as an adolescent reminded her of being young and innocent. Shirley knew when she pouted at an earlier age that she got her way and was considered cute. 8. c. John blamed the search committee, who are all right handed, for denying him the job instead of the possibility of not being qualied. 9. a. For healthy outcomes, a person has to have eective coping to engage in selecting appropriate choices. 10. a, b, c. The personality is made up of these three components accord- ing to Freud's theory. CHAPTER 8 Mental Health Treatments 1. b. Options A, C, and D are commonly seen in the crisis (or third) phase of crisis; feeling of well-being is observed in the pre-crisis phase of crisis, when the patient thinks and states that everything is \"ne.\" 2. d. The patient needs to know that he or she is away from the stress, even if it is only temporary. The person may not be able to think rationally, and to hear that safety and help are being oered can be the start of stress reduction and intervention. The following explain why the other options are not correct. A: \"Why\" needs to be avoided when possible to decrease the chance of the statement sounding judgmental and allowing the patient to feel defensive. B: Besides the fact that this is a closed- ended question, the person may not know the answer to this. It may, in fact, be one of the major causes of the stress that led to the crisis. C: This is an open-ended statement and will be valid to ask\u2014later. As one of the rst questions a person in crisis hears, it can lead to increased confusion and guilt. He or she might not have a clue as to what led to the attack or may be blaming himself or herself needlessly.2993_App-A_370-386 14/01/14 5:14 PM Page 375376 APPENDIX A|Answers and Rationales Because nobody deserves to be abused, asking the question of the person ex- periencing crisis can sound as though the nurse thinks the perpetrator had just cause to abuse. 3. c. Milieu is the therapeutic environment. It should be stress-free, or at least min- imally stress-producing, and should make the patients feel comfortable to practice new, healthy behaviors. It might be locked, depending on the patients, but it is not required to be. The patients will not usually be hospi- talized \"for life\" (however, some might be); a 72-hour-hold situation should have a milieu that corresponds to the needs of the patient being held. 4. b. ECT is not used to treat convulsive disorders. That is a mistake people make because of the name \"electrocon- vulsive therapy.\" The treatment causes a light seizure but does not treat seizure disorders. Options A, C, and D are all true about ECT. 5. d. The use of psychoactive medications can change the person's ability to think and process information and help him or her to feel dierent about the situation, which may allow other therapies to work in adjunct to the medication, to help the person toward wellness. These medications do not cure mental illness. They are used for more than just violent behavior, and although they may have an eect on pain receptors, that is a side eect rather than a primary use for this group of medications. 6. c. Patients treated with the MAOI group of medications should avoid certain foods and beverages that contain tyra- mine to avoid hypertensive crisis. 7. b. One of the goals of crisis intervention is to decrease anxiety. The person may feel a temporary increase in anxiety (e.g., at the time of being arrested or taken to the \"detox\" center), but that should resolve fairly quickly with eec- tive intervention.8. a. Repression is a defense mechanism and is therefore counterproductive in therapy. All other choices are correct. 9. b. The antianxiety drugs are potentially addictive. Patients with addictive ten- dencies may become addicted to these medications more easily than they would to drugs from other categories. 10. c. Antidepressants all carry a FDA black box warning that these medications may increase suicide risk in children and adolescents. CHAPTER 9 Alternative and Complementary Treatment Modalities 1. c. The denition of an alternative therapy is one that is used in place of conven- tional medicine. Option A suggests that such therapy has no value, which is very dependent upon the patient's beliefs. Option B is the denition of complementary therapies. Option D is incorrect; many cultures and people use alternative modalities as rst-line treatment for all types of illness. 2. d. Complementary therapies are used with conventional medicine. Option A is vague; medical treatment is not defined simply by Western standards. Option B is incorrect because a model refers to a picture an idea. Option C infers that conventional medicine is holistic, when in fact it is disease-oriented. 3. a. Integrative refers to the use of conven- tional and less traditional methods in harmony. Option B is incorrect because such combinations are not exclusive to any one belief system. Option C would leave the decision making to a physician without patient input, which is not holistic. Biofeed- back, option D, is a complementary therapy. 4. d. The mind-body connection correctly describes why belief and expectation have an eect on health and disease.2993_App-A_370-386 14/01/14 5:14 PM Page 376APPENDIX A|Answers and Rationales 377 Option A is an incorrect denition; complementary therapies are used with conventional medicine. Option B is an opinion based on the notion that the mind and body operate independently of one another. Option C describes a treatment modality rather than a mechanism. 5. b. Regardless of the nurse's own feelings, remaining open and supportive en- courages communication and rapport. Option A would have the eect of de- stroying rapport by making Mrs. Lucas wrong for her beliefs. Option C might be an observation better reported to the physician for his decision. Option D would have the LPN/LVN perform- ing well outside of his or her scope of practice in most states. 6. d. Aromatherapy, biofeedback, and mas- sage are either alternative or comple- mentary. In options A, B, and C, ECT (electroconvulsive therapy), antianxiety medications, and psychotherapy are considered conventional. 7. a. Reiki is a therapy involving energy manipulation and unblocking energy flow. Options B, C, and D are all forms of massage therapy. 8. a. T rance isan altered state of con - sciousness, but it is assuredly not sleep. Much of the therapeutic value of the work done in trance is lost if the client falls asleep. Options B, C, and D are all correct statements about trance. 9. c. This statement uses \"see\" and \"clearly\" to communicate that the speaker prefers a visual channel. Through the predicates \"feels good\" and \"gut feel- ing\" in option A, the speaker reveals a kinesthetic channel preference. In option B, the speaker demonstrates an auditory preference through the predicates \"sounds good\" and \"paying attention to.\" Option D reflects the rarely used olfactory preference; many practitioners treat these predicates as kinesthetic for therapeutic purposes.10. b. Presupposing, or assuming, that the patient will not improve will directly and indirectly negatively aect the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the nurse as well as the patient. Often mentally ill patients are more sensitive to unspoken assumption, especially when it is communicated nonverbally. Options A, C, and D will positively impact unspoken communication and improve chances for better rapport. CHAPTER 10 Anxiety, Anxiety-Related Disorders, and Somatic Symptom Disorders 1. b. The vividness of the description suggests that the person is having a flashback. Auditory hallucinations would most likely involve \"voices\" or \"hearing\" the guns. Delusions of grandeur might cause the person to go after the people with guns, while being unarmed himself or herself. Free-floating anxiety would be less descriptive. The person would not know the cause of the anxiety. 2. d. Repetitive behavior that interferes with daily functioning is indicative of OCD. 3. d. This is the best of the four choices be- cause you are simply stating for the patient to relax. You are helping him reoxygenate and refocus and you are calming him by oering to stay with him. It also buys you some time to make a visual assessment. Option A would be appropriate nursing actions, but not as the rst priority. Your rst action needs to be calming the patient and continuing to assess. B and C are nontherapeutic responses. 4. c, d. Multiple personality disorder (also known as dissociative identity disor- der) is considered to be a dissocia- tive disorder rather than an anxiety disorder. Some theorists believe that the dissociative disorders are also anxiety disorders, but most are now dierentiating the two types of dis- orders. Obsessive compulsive disor- der has Page 377378 APPENDIX A|Answers and Rationales as an anxiety disorder but that has changed in DSM-5 since it is now known to be neurologically based. 5. d. Rigid and inflexible behaviors are characteristic of OCD. These persons would like to be able to control those behaviors, but without treatment it is very dicult for them. They are not usually hostile, unless they are pre- vented from performing the obses- sion or compulsion, because that decreases the anxiety. 6. d. Phobia is an irrational fear that cannot be changed by reason or logic. The patient usually under- stands it is irrational, but the fear remains. 7. b. A compulsion is a repetitive act; an obsession is a repetitive thought. 8. a, b, c. Luvox (fluvoxemine), Prozac (fluoxetine), and Paxil (paroxe- drugs of choice for OCD. Venlafaxine is also used in treating many men- tal disorders. So be careful! All sound similar and are spelled similarly. 9. c. Acrophobia is a form of specic phobia since it is fear of a specic situation (heights). 10. a, e, and fare NOT appropriate nursing interventions. Stimuli should be diminished to decrease the stressors present. All changes in behavior and responses to treatment should be docu- mented. Activities should be encouraged, but only those that are enjoyable and do not produce additional stress. People need to acknowledge the stressors and deal with them. Avoiding or creating \"diversion\" is not the best nursing care. Creating an en- vironment where individuals feel comfortable and want to participate in activities is more therapeutic.CHAPTER 11 Depressive Disorders 1. a. This is selective reflecting. You have repeated the patient's exact words in a way that encourages her to either ex- plain herself or rephrase her response in some way. Options B, C, and D are all blocks to therapeutic communica- tion. B is challenging her, C uses the word \"why,\" and D is giving advice. 2. b. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like Zoloft typically take anywhere from 2-6 weeks to impact target symp- toms like sadness, low energy, loss of appetite, and negative thoughts. 3. c. Communicating in a judgmental manner is always a block to therapeu- tic, helping relationships. 4. c. Major depression usually manifests itself with symptoms of extreme sad- ness that is the prevalent mood for a period of at least 2 weeks. Euphoria would be more indicative of bipolar depression. 5. d. This is false reassurance, which is never appropriate in therapeutic rela- tionships. The other choices are all appropriate nursing interventions for a person who is depressed. 6. b. Patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) must avoid processed foods to avoid a hyperten- sive crisis. 7. d. Rather than pressure the patient to socialize, sitting with the patient shows acceptance and readiness to listen when patient talks. 8. c. Though symptoms of depression are quite normal, using an open-ended sentence demonstrates concern about the changes in behavior. 9. b. You want to know more about the patient's changes in behavior before jumping into a plan of action. 10. a. Though men frequently suer from depression, it is more common in women.2993_App-A_370-386 14/01/14 5:14 PM Page 378APPENDIX A|Answers and Rationales 379 CHAPTER 12 Bipolar Disorders 1. b. Dehydration can precipitate serious side eects from lithium, including tremors, seizures, and coma. 2. d. One of the main side eects of lithium is dehydration and fluid and elec- trolyte imbalance. Her dry lips, stag- gering gait, and feeling confused could all be symptoms dehydration and sodium depletion. We don't have enough information about this situa- tion to know if other factors are in- volved, such as taking incorrect dose. 3. a. Delusions of grandeur are evidenced by the patient believing that the mayor is seeking out her opinion. This is un- likely and demonstrates an unrealistic sense of self importance. 4. a. 1.0-1.5 mEq/L is the therapeutic serum concentration for acute mania. For maintenance the level is usually lower. 5. b. Olanzapine is an antipsychotic. It may be used in the treatment of psychotic behavior in bipolar disorder but may be used in combination with a mood stabilizer. 6. b. By encouraging the patient to reflect on past disappointments, you are en- couraging focus on what the person has been through. At the same time you are not negating the positive feel- ing he/she has now. Neither are you reinforcing unrealistic thinking. 7. d. The manic patient needs foods that are easy to eat while pacing or moving around. The other foods require the patient to sit down for a meal, and the patient may not be able to do that. 8. c. Given these choices, this patient would benet from medication to help pre- vent injury from hyperactivity. 9. d. To be given the diagnosis of Bipolar II the individual must have recurrent depression with bouts of hypomania. The other choices contain incorrect information. 10. a. Stimulants could easily precipitate a manic episode or intensity a current one. All the others may be utilized eectively. 11. a. Cyclothymic disorder is a chronic mood disturbance of at least a 2-year duration involving numerous episodes of hypomania and depressed mood but of less intensity. CHAPTER 13 Suicide 1. d. Teaching skills to help the patient deal with the problems of day-to-day life will be helpful in the long run. Option B is a mistake made by people who be- lieve the myth that some suicide at- tempts are not serious. C is a block to therapeutic communication (disagree- ing) and may give false hope. The patient does not see that there is much to live for, or the suicide would proba- bly not have been attempted. A is also incorrect because reporting the patient to the police is not required in most communities and could be a threat to the patient. 2. b. People are more likely to carry out the suicide when they appear to feel better. This is when they have the energy to create a plan and carry it out. When they are deeply depressed or confused, they often are not able to think clearly enough to do these things. When peo- ple feel loved and appreciated, they are less likely to think about suicide. This may be a temporary feeling on their part, however. 3. c. If a person is talking about suicide, the possibility for carrying it out is very real and must be taken seriously. In very few situations is suicidal ideation a manipulative or attention-seeking behavior. Suicide may be an impulsive act but the person is usually thinking about it for some time.2993_App-A_370-386 14/01/14 5:14 PM Page 379380 APPENDIX A|Answers and d. This man has denite potential for self-harm. He is not attempting to manipulate his wife's feelings, although she may feel that he is. 5. b. Your rst action is to place the patient on one-on-one observation. Some facilities accomplish this by having sta perform rounds at a minimum of every 15 minutes; most facilities assign a sta person to stay with the patient. There is no need to place the patient in a locked unit at this time, nor is it appropriate to publicize the precautions to the whole facility. It would not be appro- priate to give him his razor, as this could be an implement he could use to perform the suicide. 6. c. Document the discussion but explain that the precautions remain in eect. It is for his safety and the safety of others that the precautions are policy, generally. You may thank him for sharing his beliefs, and depending on where he is in his treatment, it may become appropriate for him to share his belief system with others. 7. b. Older men who live alone with a his- tory of alcohol abuse are at one of the highest risks for suicide. Though any of the other examples could be suici- dal they do not represent the most frequent statistically. 8. d. This response is supportive and em- pathetic. Responses A and B reflect insensitivity to the patient's distress. Asking the question of response C has nothing to do with the depth of distress this patient must have felt, so it inappropriate. 9. b. By asking the patient directly what she plans to do you are gaining im- portant information and communi- cating your concern to the patient. Since she told you her plan, you know she is reaching out for help. 10. a. By reaching out to you, she is commu- nicating her mixed feelings about sui- cide and is indirectly asking for help.CHAPTER 14 Personality Disorders 1. d. Consequences should always be stated at the time the limits are set, to in- crease consistency. The problems with options A through C are as follows. A: When the behavior occurs, the patient may be testing, but if the conse- quences are not known, the patient has not been given enough informa- tion to make an appropriate choice. B: Anticipating a behavior is presuming, and you may be presuming incor- rectly. This sets up negative expecta- tions from the patient. C: The limits should not be set for the convenience of the sta or family or anyone but the patient. Family should be involved in the care plan if the patient is agreeable. 2. c. David is most likely displaying signs of antisocial personality disorder evi- denced by information that he tends to lie, has committed a crime, and his patterns with job and personal rela- tionships. He is not exhibiting signs of suspiciousness or paranoia, nor is he behaving in a dependent manner. 3. a. Manipulation is used frequently by patients with personality disorders. This mechanism can be used with other disorders but it is a primary mechanism in personality disorders. 4. d. Interpersonal relationships are among the most dicult activities for a per- son with a personality disorder to de- velop. They can participate in group activities because they can excel and bring attention and gratication to themselves, but developing a close per- sonal relationship is very dicult. 5. c. Antisocial (sociopathic) personality is usually the type of disorder in which a person would be in trouble with the law. 6. b. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by bizarre and unusual behaviors\u2014some of which may be also seen in schizophrenia.2993_App-A_370-386 14/01/14 5:14 PM Page 380APPENDIX A|Answers and Rationales 381 7. c. The nurse needs to understand how he/she reacts to the challenging behaviors exhibited by people with personality disorders. Medications, long-term therapy, and in-patient hospitalization are rarely eective. 8. c. Characteristics of narcissistic person- ality include exaggerated sense of self- importance and lack of concern for the nurse's time. 9. d. Vague communication is not accept- able. Honesty and clarity in commu- nication are always necessary. The patient may feel inferior, which may be part of the manipulation. The nurse needs to confront the feelings of inferiority or any others that the patient might state. 10. b. Borderline personality. This group tends to engage in self-mutilating behaviors. CHAPTER 15 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 1. d. Inviting the patient to the party brings him into the present and allows him to make the choice for himself. This will help increase self-esteem and di- minish other symptoms. Option A begins to reinforce the hallucinations, which is never appropriate for nurses. B and C are forms of demands, which may cause the patient to revert to neg- ative and possibly aggressive behaviors. 2. a. Shawna's symptoms are consistent with patients who have catatonic schizo- phrenia. Option D, schizotypal, is a type of personality disorder but not actually a form of schizophrenia. 3. a. This is an example of a hallucination. The patient is seeing something that is not there. There is nothing actually visible that could be misinterpreted as a snake; if there were, this would be an illusion. 4. c. This is the honest response, and it focuses on returning the patient to reality. The other responses play into the hallucination or border on belit- tling the patient. 5. c. Patients with schizophrenia do not function well in society without treat- ment. Even with treatment, some patients have a dicult time. The \"reality\" of schizophrenic people is their own reality and not the reality of the rest of society. 6. b. It is important always to deal with reality and the present when dealing with people with schizophrenia. Never reinforcing hallucinations and directing people away from situations that are stressful or competitive are also impor- tant. ECT is not a nursing function. 7. b. This time you are dealing with an illusion. There is something on the ceiling, and the patient is misinter- preting what is there. 8. c. Once again, maintaining honesty and reality is the best response. 9. a. Echolalia is the behavior or symptom of catatonic schizophrenia involving the patient repeating a word or part of a word or phrase over and over. Ecopraxia is repetitive movement or actions. 10. a. Delusions of grandeur include believ- ing one is not subject to the laws of nature. 11. a. Muscle rigidity and protruding tongue are classic symptoms of EPS in addi- tion to restlessness and tremors. 12. c. Decreasing anxiety and promoting trust are both realistic goals. Both of these are a process that can be helped over time. 13. a. We now know that schizophrenia is a brain abnormality. CHAPTER 16 Neurocognitive Disorders: Delirium and Dementia 1. b. Delirium is probably the best choice, since the patient presented as alert and oriented before surgery. Nothing2993_App-A_370-386 14/01/14 5:14 PM Page 381382 APPENDIX A|Answers and Rationales indicates dementia at this point. She is not delusional; she is having a halluci- nation. The dilemma may be in what the nurse chooses to do next. 2. a. Your best action is to call your charge nurse and/or physician immediately. Your state Nurse Practice Act will dic- tate whom you should call rst. T urn- ing on the light may be helpful, but asking about the spiders plays into the hallucination, which is not therapeu- tic. Stopping the patient's pain med- ications is not an independent nursing function; you need to make that call to the physician rst. Checking her medical record should have been done earlier, and it will not be helpful to her right now. 3. c. By reflecting back to Mrs. H your ob- servation, you are promoting good communication and emotional support. The other choices are all blocks to ther- apeutic or helping communication. 4. b. Aricept can cause insomnia. It can also cause bradycardia not tachycardia. 5. d. Although Alzheimer's type dementia is not a result of aging or arteriosclerosis, these conditions may be present in addition to the dementia. 6. c. You would expect to see memory and other cognitive processes impaired in someone with an organic mental disor- der. The person will probably not be oriented to at least one of the three spheres of person, place, or time. 7. b. These symptoms are consistent with a person's having delirium. The admis- sion of alcohol use adds to this conclu- sion. Time or decompensation of memory and behavior might change this initial diagnosis to a form of de- mentia. Alcohol-related dementia can develop in someone with a long his- tory of alcoholism. 8. cThis is the best option. You are showing concern for the patient, the family, and their situation. You have stated the im- plied message and oered to get the physician, who must be the one to give the initial information. You have maintained dignity for all, while behaving professionally. 9. d. Vascular or multi-infarct dementia is usually the result of several smaller strokes. The patient has usually had conditions such as high blood pres- sure for quite some time. The condi- tion displays many of the same behaviors as other types of dementia but is also usually irreversible. 10. d. The patient with delirium receives the greatest benet from reorientation techniques. In advanced dementia, repeated attempts at orientation can contribute to anxiety. CHAPTER 17 Substance Use and Addictive Disorders 1. c. Denial is the most common defense mechanism used by people who are chemically dependent. Rationalization is also used by some patients. 2. a. Alcohol is a CNS depressant that can lead to impaired judgment, confusion, lethargy, and coma in large amounts, The \"high\" that people feel is tempo- rary and very misleading. 3. d. T remors, confusion, and hallucinations are the classic symptoms of delirium tremens. 4. d. Sally may very well be codependent in her sister's alcohol abuse. Sally is tak- ing responsibility for Susie's behavior instead of having Susie take care of herself. 5. b. This response addresses both sisters and tells them they both need help. It is honest and caring, and puts the responsibility on them to help them- selves through this situation. 6. a. Susie should be encouraged to attend weekly AA meetings and Sally to at- tend weekly Al-Anon meetings. We do not know from the information if they 2993_App-A_370-386 14/01/14 5:14 PM Page 382APPENDIX A|Answers and Rationales 383 are adult children of alcoholics. There is no need to check into the unit weekly, but they can be told that it is acceptable to call or check in if they choose to do so. The psychologist will tell them the meeting schedule; this would not be a nursing function for discharge planning. 7. c. These behaviors are the classic ones that indicate an addiction. 8. a. Honest communication is necessary for the person and family to heal. 9. b. Codependent. In an eort to be caring, you are inadvertently making excuses and encouraging the drinking behavior. 10. b. Chlordiazepoxide is often used to safely detoxify a person from heavy alcohol use. It is relatively safe and reduces the risk for complications from alcohol such as seizures. 11. d. Alcoholics Anonymous is a lifelong commitment as one admits power- lessness over alcohol and remains in need of this support. 12. a. Methamphetamine abuse often includes appetite suppression and weight loss. CHAPTER 18 Eating Disorders 1. c. Anorexia nervosa is the fear of food. Bulimia nervosa is termed \"binge eat- ing.\" Pica is an eating disorder seen in young children. 2. b. This response is therapeutic\u2014 demonstrating your eorts to help the patient identify the feelings she ex- periences when trying to eat. Reponses A and D are threats, and appetite stimu- lants are not useful since the disorder is unrelated to appetite. 3. b. Patients who have anorexia have an intense fear of being fat. They have an inaccurate sense of their size and body image and will not develop normal eating patterns without much help and behavior modication.4. a. A nutritional deficit, and probably a fluid imbalance, exists in patients who are anorectic. The fluid imbal- ance is caused by the lack of intake and perhaps vomiting. There is also a body image disturbance, but it is a negative self-perception rather than a positive one. 5. d. Unlocking the feelings surrounding an eating disorder can be very helpful to the patient and treatment team. Focusing on the food and the destruc- tive behaviors associated with the food puts the emphasis on the wrong area. 6. c. Patients with bulimia nervosa cannot control their eating. They binge and purge, and they are overly concerned and preoccupied with body shape and size. 7. d. This statement conveys your desire to help with ANY concern this patient may have postoperatively. The other options do show a concern and inter- est in this patient, but focusing on food and weight may limit the pa- tient's willingness to oer other needs. The patient may also not be ready to talk about weight yet. This is a hope- ful yet traumatic step for many. 8. b. This response is a combination of the therapeutic techniques of parroting and open-ended question. It uses the patient's words and leaves the question open for Donald to elaborate. The other choices are nontherapeutic and do not allow for patient expression. 9. c. These are the classic symptoms of bulimia. 10. c. After binging, the person seeks a re- lease of tension related to shame and guilt by purging. CHAPTER 19 Childhood and Adolescent Mental Health Issues 1. b. Safety for children with conduct disor- der is primary in importance. Chances are that the child will not settle2993_App-A_370-386 14/01/14 5:14 PM Page 383384 APPENDIX A|Answers and Rationales quickly, and asking the parent to leave with the child is not a supportive ac- tion for either the parent or child. 2. c. Exposing the child to one new person rather than several will help the child develop a relationship. More than one person and touching the child may increase anxiety. Isolating the child at the same time will reinforce fears. 3. d. Children often act out or draw pictures about what is troubling them. Oering toys or drawing materials and observ- ing the child discreetly can tell you much about what he or she has experi- enced. It may also serve as a diversion, but oering toys or drawing materials is meant to encourage self-expression rather than serve as a diversion from the situation. 4. d. Physical activity is a good outlet for the ADHD child. Checkers and video games are too sedentary, and pool requires concentration that may be dicult for the child. 5. b. CNS stimulants are eective with ADHD to increase levels of neuro- transmitters to elicit a calming eect. 6. d. All of these choices apply to ADHD. 7. b. The most common symptom of autism is impaired social functioning. The pa- tient does not make strong friendships. Emotions may be completely opposite of what would be appropriate, and the patient may achieve an appropriate developmental task and then regress, or may not achieve appropriate devel- opmental tasks at all. 8. c. This is the best choice of the options listed, because it implies the nurse heard the parents' concerns and recog- nized the need to get them appropriate help right away. The other options are either nontherapeutic or provide false hope to the parents. They may sound polite but are not helpful for the par- ents, who are concerned they did something wrong and want to know how they can help their child.9. c. Chaotic home life is a common thread in children with conduct disorder. 10. c. The FDA has issued a black box warning on all antidepressants to monitor children and teens for sui- cide when taking these medications. CHAPTER 20 Postpartum Issues in Mental Health 1. b. Projecting evilness onto the infant is a sign of postpartum psychosis. The other responses are all normal reflec- tions of anxiety about the baby or the mother. 2. d. Highly labile emotions related to the baby are a common sign of postpar- tum blues. Response B and C are signs of more serious disorders that could impact the infant's care. Response A is a normal concern of a new mother. 3. b. Postpartum blues usually start a few days after birth. These blues are com- mon and not a psychiatric diagnosis nor reflect problems in bonding. 4. a. Postpartum depression is closely related to depression in a previous pregnancy. The other choices may be factors that could contribute to depression but are not the most important cause. The other responses are not appropriate. Antidepressants are not needed for postpartum blues. 5. b. Giving the new mother information on this being a normal response is an important intervention. 6. c. This response demonstrates sensitivity for the need to grieve this loss. The other responses demonstrate insensitiv- ity to the depth of the loss. 7. b. This statement is concerning that this new mother may be progressing to depression or some other disorder. More follow-up and support is needed. Response C could be an indicator of a postpartum psychosis. A and D are more likely to associated with postpar- tum blues.2993_App-A_370-386 14/01/14 5:14 PM Page 384APPENDIX A|Answers and Rationales 385 8. b. Mood stabilizers have been linked to malformations in neonates. 9. c. Antidepressants are an eective treat- ment of postpartum depression. The other responses are inaccurate. Diet and exercise may be helpful in depres- sion but would not be the major treat- ment for this psychiatric disorder. 10. d. All of these choices must be addressed in postpartum psychosis. This is an emergency for safety of the newborn. CHAPTER 21 Aging Population 1. b. Reinforce the word by showing or han- dling the object. T rying to guess the word or nishing the patient's sentence can be frustrating and insulting and can discourage the patient from at- tempting to communicate. Asking the patient to think about the word while you do something else is distracting. 2. d. Federal regulations require that the assessment be conducted by an RN for purposes of consistency. All other people on the health-care team supply input and documentation to assist with the assessment. 3. c. Medication side eect would be the most obvious possibility, as the medica- tion is a recent change in routine, and normal vital signs should help rule out the possibility of a recent stroke. De- pression is a more distant possibility. 4. c. You have been assertive and told the patient what you wanted in a way that encouraged the patient to participate in a specic activity. This also supports the person's self-esteem. 5. b. The losses experienced as people age are frequent causes of depression. 6. d. Dementia is not a part of normal aging. Other possibilities for unusual behavior should be ruled out before diagnosing a person with dementia. 7. b. Aphasia is the speech complication that often results from stroke. Aect can also change after a stroke, but that is not a speech diculty. 8. b. Drugs are metabolized more slowly in older people, which results in a cu- mulative eect that leads to toxicity. 9. c. These could be symptoms of elder abuse. The location of the bruises is consistent with shaking or beating. The lack of eye contact or verbal re- sponse indicates that the patient may fear. More investigation is needed that the beatings might get worse. 10. d. OBRA stands for Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. It establishes stan- dards for the care of the older adult. 11. b. Progressive memory loss is not a nor- mal part of aging. When memory loss is apparent, more evaluation of the causes and nursing interventions to deal with it are important. 12. a. Providing support to a coworker is most important. The other choices are more clinical questions. CHAPTER 22 Victims of Abuse and Violence 1. d. Showing empathy for the patient, oering to provide further assistance, and reassuring safety will help the patient to trust you and probably to be more comfortable and compliant with examinations. 2. b. Getting a statement in the patient's own words and documenting it in the medical record are required. Option A is information that the patient may not know. The word \"why\" is counter- productive in therapeutic communica- tion. C is not recommended for reasons of liability for both the nurse and the patient. It is most likely a violation of your agency policy as well as a violation of professional ethics. Option D is in- appropriate as it has nothing to do with the rape. 3. c. You need to be helpful to both people. You will need to take care of the physical2993_App-A_370-386 14/01/14 5:14 PM Page 385386 APPENDIX A|Answers and Rationales and emotional health of both patients, and you will do it according to the de- gree of immediacy called for. A physi- cian must be called if one is not in the area, but until he or she arrives, your nursing care, observation, and docu- mentation will help ensure the best possible care for the patients. 4. c. You let Mrs. X know that you hear her concern and need for help. You are oering the best help you can at the moment, while allowing her to make the decision about speaking to the social worker. 5. c. While some patients may express displeasure at someone going ahead, most will realize something is terribly wrong. Apologize for their inconven- ience and have someone assist them as soon as possible. Attending to this woman, her immediate needs, and those of her children is the best nurs- ing choice. You may also let her know that someone will be in who can help her with safety issues, but it is impor- tant to get her in a quiet, safe room. After all, the perpetrator may be right behind her. She knows that. 6. a. You are showing empathy, being non- judgmental, and oering the patient assistance. Oering to her that she needs to leave sounds helpful and may be true, but she has to make that de- cision on her own. The organization you oered her in option A may assist with that as well. \"Why\" is a nonther- apeutic response. Asking if he's done that before does make an attempt at gathering information and showing concern, but the more immediate need now is to support her and oer her some options for assistance. 7. c. There is evidence to indicate the pos- sibility of the abuse cycle. All the other responses may be accurate, but there is not enough information to determine this. This woman may believe she must return to the home where abuse is probably occurring. 8. c. Physical and emotional support is the most important initial intervention. The other interventions may be needed later in the visit. 9. b. Rape is an act of violence and not related to sexual desire. 10. b. The son may need to see the will to obtain information for nancial plan- ning of patient's resources. Responses A and C indicate the caregiver is over- stepping his/her boundaries. Would need more information to determine if response D is appropriate.2993_App-A_370-386 14/01/14 5:14 PM Page 386387APPENDIXB Agencies That Help People Who Have Threats to Their Mental Health 1.National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) 6001 Executive Boulevard, 443-4279 www.nimh.nih.gov 2.Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance 730 Franklin Street, Suite 501 Chicago, IL 60610-7224 (800) 826-3632; Fax: (312) 642-7243 www.dbsalliance.org 3.National Alliance Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Widowed Persons Services Social Outreach and Support 1909 K Street NW Washington, DC 20049 (202) 728-4370 www.aarp.org 7.National Hospice & 837-1233 www.nhpco.org 8.Child (816) 252-8388; Fax (816) 252-1337 www.childabuseprevention.org 9.National Council of Alcohol and Drug Dependence 217 Broadway, Suite 712 New York, NY 10007 Hope Line: (800) Mailing Address: A.A.
