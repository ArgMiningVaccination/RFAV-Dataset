Everything is natural, and users just have to use one tablet a day to get the powerful effects. What is Power Bite? Having a friendly and fresh smile is one of the easiest ways to make a great impression on someone else. For some people, dental hygiene is one of their biggest priorities, which is why they have such beautiful teeth and healthy gums. Unfortunately, some people are more prone to dental issues, even if they religiously brush and floss every day. Finding a supplement that can provide the missing nutrients helps consumers to rectify this imbalance. That's why the support offered with Power Bite is so important. Made within an FDA registered facility, Power Bite is balanced perfectly to support the teeth and gums with an assortment of helpful minerals and botanicals. Prepared by helpful researchers, consumers will gradually change the saliva to ensure that the gums and teeth are properly supported. This formula is not a replacement for proper dental hygiene, but it can complement a healthy routine. Dental care can be quite expensive. The cost of not taking care of the teeth and gums is too high to ignore, leading to major health problems down the line. With enough damage, these health problems can extend down the rest of the throat, digestive system, and the other organs in the body. Handling dental health issues as they arise can prevent potentially life-threatening conditions down the line. While it can be expensive to go to a dentist, using a dental candy like Power Bite can make a huge difference, saving consumers thousands of dollars in dental costs down the line.

To get all of the support that Power Bite offers, consumers will have the support of: - Calcium carbonate - Myrrh - Wild mint - Xylitol - Lysozyme - Mediterranean Sea salt - Clove oil Everything found in this formula is completely natural, and it is why easy to use. This formula is notably absent of stimulants, and there's no risk of forming habits. To learn more about each of the ingredients, read on below. Calcium Carbonate Calcium carbonates are included and a diet when the amount of calcium that the individual consumes isn't enough for their body. The human body requires calcium to help them build up healthy bones, muscles, and nervous system. This particular type of calcium can be used in a medicinal way to alleviate heartburn, indigestion, and upset stomach when used on its own. While calcium carbonate is typically safe for consistent use, some of the known side effects in some cases include swelling, gaining weight quickly, or increased levels of calcium in the bloodstream. Some people with a greater sensitivity might experience Constipation, weakness, vomiting, or even bone pain if they exceed the daily recommended amount of calcium carbonate. However, this formula only includes what consumers need, rather than exceeding the recommended daily amount. Though calcium carbonate may seem like a rather scientific name for such an essential mineral, it is actually one of the two different forms of baking soda. The other form of baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. Some of the current research shows that including enough calcium in the diet can reduce the risk of heart disease, which is particularly seen in women after they have gone through menopause. Maintaining bone health is essential to healthy teeth and gums, as well as the prevention of bone disease.

It is typically prepared with a steam distillation process, which is the reason that it is amber to brown with an earthy scent. It is a major essential oil in Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine, though researchers are only just starting to understand how many ways it can be used for the human body. The main reason consumers include myrrh in their diet to help with their teeth and gums is because of the effect that it has on harmful bacteria. Since much of the issue in tooth decay and gum disease has to do with an improper level of bacteria in the saliva, correcting this imbalance is essential. According to initial studies on animals, this essential oil is able to directly kill the bacteria and support the healthy immune system to further protect the body. More directly, myrrh can help users to reduce the risk of oral infections, soothing inflammation when included in toothpaste and natural mouthwashes. In one study on the effects of myrrh on people with Bechet's disease, using myrrh Four times a day on mouth sores helps to heal them and reduce pain. Wild Mint No dental care remedy is truly complete without including mint, which is primarily used to help with freshness. However, it comes with its own set of helpful benefits. Mint is high in nutrients that support healthy brain function, but it also has a powerful effect on the digestive system. According to current research, mint can improve irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, but it also can alleviate indigestion and substantially improve symptoms of the common cold. The antioxidants in mint can reduce the effects of free radical damage has had in the body, and anyone with gum disease is most likely to have endured some of the wrath of this damage. Mint is incredibly supportive to the immune system, which means that consumers increase their protection against many illnesses. Using mint is often associated with improved brain function because it can promote better alertness and attention. It is also beneficial for anyone experiencing mental fatigue. However, these brain health benefits are typically seen when inhaling the essential oils of the mint plants, rather than directly consuming it. According to some studies on the use of mint, it helps to reduce fatigue, anxiety, and even frustration. Researchers have found that the simple aroma of this essential oil is enough to make the mind and body calmer, though this benefit is also seen in the use of mint as a food. This soothing effect extends to blood pressure as well, bringing down levels to reduce the risk of hypertension.

The Power Bite formula doesn't have any sugar to reduce the risk of damage to the teeth, which is why diethyl is used in place of sugar to prepare this candy. However, xylitol is one of the leading ingredients in sugar free products, including toothpaste and mouthwash. It is a sugar alcohol, which can be naturally sourced from some fruits, oats, mushrooms, lettuce, plums, berries, and trees. However, the majority of xylitol that is currently used in American products comes from corn fiber or birch trees. Despite being primarily used for flavor, xylitol also helps with several health benefits. The glycemic index of xylitol is very low, which means that diabetic or pre diabetic individuals will not have to worry about raising their blood sugar. It does not have any influence on insulin production, which is the reason it doesn't have any of the dangerous effects that sugar does. Using gum with xylitol is highly recommended by dentists around the world because it supports dental health and reduces the risk of tooth decay. Streptococcus mutans is the bacteria primarily responsible for accumulating plaque on the teeth, and it directly feeds on sugar. By replacing sugar with xylitol in any candy or oral health products, this strain of bacteria is starved, making it incapable of damaging the teeth with toxic plaque. Mediterranean Sea Salt Many people are familiar with table salt, but Mediterranean Sea salt is a much different story. This type of salt comes from the Mediterranean Sea, and researchers believe that it is healthier than using table salt because of the reduced sodium levels and the high amount of important minerals. It is available as a course or fine salt, and it can be used in cooking. The flavor is much more delicate than table salts, which might be the reason it is included in a dental candy. Unlike table salt, it has not been stripped of all of its natural health benefits, making it a welcome ingredient for this type of product. According to current research, Mediterranean Sea salt can help consumers to lose weight. When the human body ingests sea salt, it improves the production of the juices associated with digestion. The body is able to digest food at a rapid pace, which means that consumers do not have to worry about weight gain. It also means that they can reduce the risk of constipation or other gastrointestinal issues. When used topically, Mediterranean Sea salt can help with skin conditions. It soothes inflammation associated with eczema, psoriasis, back acne, and related issues, though these changes are often seen when Mediterranean Sea salt is used in a bath. Consumers also use a little Mediterranean Sea salt on their tongue as a way to reduce the risk of asthma. Anecdotal evidence suggests that putting sea salt on the tongue and drinking water after can help individuals during an asthma attack, though it is not widely accepted as a natural treatment method. The idea is that the anti-inflammatory benefits would make breathing easier.

Naturally found in Indonesia and Madagascar, a clove is a flower found on a tropical Evergreen tree with pink flower buds. It blooms in the late summer and in winter, and the locals harvest the dried, brown leaves to create either essential oils with steam distillation or a powder that is prepared when it is ground. For centuries, traditional Chinese medicine has used cloves as homeopathic remedies for the mouth. Clothes can even be used to help with dry sockets after dental surgery, reducing the pain and discomfort that consumers feel during the healing process. According to a study in the Journal of Dentistry, the essential oils extracted from cloves offered such a powerful numbing effect that it was compared to benzocaine. Clothes naturally contain a compound called eugenol, which is why it is included in mouthwashes, perfumes, and vanilla extract. Eugenol is the reason that it is included in oral health formulas like Power Bite, helping to get rid of the pain that comes from issues in the oral cavity. When clove oil is used in the mouth, it can numb the nerves to stop tooth pain for up to three hours. Unfortunately, it is not used to solve issues like cavities and gum disease.
