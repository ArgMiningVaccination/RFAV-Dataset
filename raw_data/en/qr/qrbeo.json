Renew Wellness & Aesthetics is proud to now offer IV Vitamin Therapy to promote a healthy immune system! IV Vitamin Therapy is a proven treatment which allows patients to take a proactive and long-term approach to wellness while accelerating healing and boosting immunity. This intravenous infusion of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and amino acids has been utilized for decades to help boost the immune system to fight off infection and treat a variety of conditions such as respiratory infections and the common cold. What is IV Therapy used for? IV Vitamin Therapy is a practical approach to deliver nutrients straight to the cells, giving them an extra boost of energy. It can be used to boost immunity, fight off cold, flu, and other viral infections, provide detoxification, improve leaky gut, enhance athletic performance, and more! Why is IV Therapy used? During therapy, you receive an iv infusion of nutrients individually prescribed to you to address your wellness needs and goals. The slow intravenous infusion allows you to receive increased concentrations of nutrients into the bloodstream, which aren't attainable with oral or intramuscular administration. Some of these immune-boosting vitamins and nutrients include Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid), B complex vitamins, Magnesium, and Glutathione. The key ingredient in boosting your immune system against viral infections is Vitamin C, also known as Ascorbic Acid. It is important during these times to understand that a preventative treatment strategy can be a great defense for your immune system. Many hospitals around the country are utilizing IV Vitamin C as an adjunct to treatment in COVID-19 patients. The following suggestions to boost your body's defense mechanisms have been shown in recent studies to be very promising against viral exposure: How does IV Therapy work? Prevention includes: - Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid): 2-4 grams (2000-4000 mg) per day - Vitamin C in the form of Ascorbic Acid has been shown to do two very important things as it relates to the coronavirus: - It increases T-lymphocytes production. T-lymphocytes are our immune fighting warriors! - It prevents \"furin cleaving\" of the virus into the host cell. This means that it can help prevent the virus from attaching to the human lung cells (where it replicates), thereby slowing the progression of the illness to respiratory distress. How long does IV Therapy last? The treatments themselves will typically last around an hour, but the benefits of the treatments can last up to several weeks. It is very common and SAFE for patients to get IV Nutrient therapy as often as every week. We have patients who travel a lot or who may be sick who will get treatment as frequently as every week, and we also have patients who get benefit from the treatment by having an infusion every 2-4 weeks.
