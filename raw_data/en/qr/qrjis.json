An effective way to develop this skill is participation in the Three-Minute Thesis, or 3MT, which is very different than other academic exercises in research distillation, such as pitches and lightening talks. Developed in 2008 by the University of Queensland in Australia and now practiced at universities around the globe, the 3MT challenges researchers to tell an appealing story to a non-specialist audience in three minutes or less. Accompanying the narration is a single static graphic to enhance the audience's understanding. [Timeline] GradResearch Live! is held toward the end of every fall semester so that the first and second place winners of the 3MT Track (see Tracks & Prizes below) can go on to compete in regional 3MT competitions in the spring semesters. [Tracks & Prizes] - Early-Research or pre-3MT (master's and doctoral; students in proposal stage or with preliminary findings) - 1st place: $500 - 2nd with results/conclusions) - 1st place: $750 (and advancement to regional competition) - 2nd as a postdoctoral fellow/scholar) - 1st place: $500 & Submission] Click here for tips and tricks on how to begin planning your GradResearch Live! presentation: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PW8ACzcPSPbdGHQhRLVQfWIXrcG12wGT/copy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PW8ACzcPSPbdGHQhRLVQfWIXrcG12wGT/copy) Below are the official rules of the competition. Please read and follow all rules before submitting your video. - The competition is limited to currently enrolled masters and doctoral students, or postdocs, at the University of Kentucky who have not previously won a campus-wide 3MT competition. (Postdocs are only eligible to compete in the postdoc track.) - Finalists must present live in the Esports Theater on Thursday, November 10th, 2022, without the aid of notecards or cheat-sheets - No additional sound or video is permitted in the presentation. - No additional props (e.g. costumes, musical instruments, laboratory equipment, etc.) are permitted. - Presentations are limited to 3 minutes maximum; competitors exceeding 3 minutes are disqualified. (A timer will be displayed at the finals.) - Presentations are to be spoken-word prose (e.g. no poetry, raps, or songs). - Presentations are considered to have commenced when a presenter starts their presentation through either movement or speech. - The decision of the judges is final. [About 3MT] UK GradResearch Live! was born out of the The University of Queensland's 3-Minute Thesis (3MT) competition, a research presentation initiative that challenges graduate students to effectively communicate their research to a general audience, with a single slide, in three minutes or less. [Click here to learn more about the history of 3MT](https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/about). The Graduate School and Graduate Student Congress have hosted 3MT competitions at The University of Kentucky since 2013, and our participants have found them an excellent way to practice their communication and presentation skills while sharing their research with their peers. This year we're rebranding and expanding the competition to reach a larger audience across campus and throughout the local community with a public showcase, numerous prizes, and a reception.
