Our department has more than doubled in size of the faculty over the last seven years, with 46 faculty in civil and environmental engineering, and has more than doubled in size of the graduate program over the last seven years, with over 230 graduate students. Building out the research infrastructure of the university, this past spring the university opened the new 220,000 square foot Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex that provides state-of-the art laboratories in engineering and science. This year the department launches a new BS in Environmental Engineering, with plans for it to be ABET accredited for our first graduates. This degree program reflects our significant growth and expansion of scope in environmental engineering and water resources engineering and includes several new courses. Last year we also launched two new graduate degrees, including an MS in Environmental Engineering (MSEnvE) and an MS in Engineering and Public Policy (MSEPP) with two concentrations, including Energy and Environment, and Infrastructure Resilience. These degrees focus on topics of significant national need, with the MSEnvE integrating environmental engineering and science with public health, water sustainability, and water-energy-nexus, and the MSEPP degree providing students with the core skills needed to address engineering solutions while recognizing the impact of public policy and societal constraints on these solutions. The department continues to expand its research presence across all fields, and is currently leading the PROTECT Center, funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) of the National Institutes of Health, and the CRECE Center, funded by NIEHS and the Environmental Protection Agency, to study the relationship between environmental contamination and preterm birth. Our scholars strive to use today's discovery and research to make tomorrow happen. You can see some highlights of our civil and environmental engineering faculty members at northeastern.edu/tomorrow. We hope you enjoy this report, and we look forward to sharing our future accomplishments in our annual scholarship reports. Sincerely, Jerome F. Hajjar, Ph.D., P .E.

The work includes large scale testing to assess flexural local buckling strength and performance, including experimental assessment of residual stress fields, detailed measurements of the initial imperfect geometry of the tube, measurements of local deformation during and after the completion of each test to enable analysis of the onset and evolution of local buckling, and an experimental investigation into the fatigue behavior of the weld intersection detail. These experimental results are intended to inform existing codified design methodologies and to enable non-existing, but more sophisticated design procedures.

Alshawabkeh MODELING GROUNDWATER FLOW AND CONTAMINANT TRANSPORT IN THE NORTH COAST LIMESTONE KARST AQUIFER SYSTEM OF PUERTO RICO Our first study applies an Equivalent Porous Media (EPM) approach to simulate groundwater hydraulics and contaminant transport in NPR karst aquifers. The water-table fluctuation results indicate that the model can practically reflect the steady-state groundwater hydraulics (normalized RMSE of 12.4%) and long-term variability (normalized RMSE of 3.0%) at regional and intermediate scales. Additionally, the EPM approach is capable to reproduce the spreading of a TCE plume at intermediate scales with sufficient accuracy (normalized RMSE of 8.45%). While the field data sparsity often limits the ability to locate and characterize the conduit system, a method is introduced in our second study for modeling the karst conduits. Connecting sinkholes and springs, implemented drain cells improve the developed regional model by simulating the drainage effects of conduit networks on local groundwater table.

Wang MOBILE ACOUSTIC SENSING OF SURFACE WAVES FOR ROAD SUBSURFACE ASSESSMENT Efficient and economical solutions for monitoring the conditions of transportation infrastructure are in urgent and critical demand in United States. The current state of road and bridge network health of United States has fallen into disturbing circumstances according to recent report cards administered by the American Society of Civil Engineering (ASCE). In 2013, road conditions scored a D and bridges received a grade of C +. The national transportation infrastructure conditions affect not only the lives of average people utilizing roadways, but also the economic efficiency and security of the country. Efforts to monitor the health of transportation infrastructure include examinations of both surface and subsurface levels. Diagnosing problems at the subsurface level is equally as vital for transportation infrastructure as identifying surface level issues. One major technique used to study the state of subsurface infrastructure is the surface wave method which uses mechanical vibration measurements nondestructively. The subsurface profile information, such as stiffness and layer thickness, is measured from the dispersion characteristics of the ground by exciting surface waves and then picking up their vibration responses. See full dissertation at coe.neu.edu/17/YifengLuAnshuman Kunwar PhD 2017, Civil Engineering ; Advisor, Dionisio Bernal SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION FREE DAMAGE LOCALIZATION One of the most widely used frameworks for vibration based structural damage identification involves characterizing damage as changes in the modal parameters of the structure between reference and damaged states respectively. Modal parameters are derived from the responses measured from the structure by implementing system identification. The sensitivity of the identified modal parameters to noise and lack thereof to the damage lead to inaccurate identification of parameters and incorrect damage characterization. As an obvious approach to circumvent problems associated with system identification, system identification free damage localization seems a worthwhile venture. Steady State Shift Damage Localization (S3DL) is the major damage localization technique developed in this thesis. S3DL operate with two different frequency domain vector spaces. One of the vector spaces are derived from the Fourier transform of the measured responses in undamaged and damaged states and regarded as experimental subspace and the other one is called model subspace, formed by using the model of the undamaged structure and the postulated damage. The method operates under the premise that the spatial distribution of loads is invariant in undamaged and damaged state. The method does not require the time histories of the loads.

Hybrid simulation is a method which combines physical test specimens with an analytical model to capture the response of an entire system. In each simulation, multiple full-scale RC columns were tested at the Multi-Axial Full Scale Sub-Structured Testing & Simulation (MUST-SIM) lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. The remainder of the full three-dimensional structural system was modeled analytically in the computer program OpenSees. Shear-axial failures occurred in the physical specimens as a result of the ground motion, and the hybrid nature of the test allowed for study of the system-level response of the surrounding structural system.

Eckelman GEOSPATIAL MODELING OF URBAN BUILDINGS AND LAND USE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS AND RESOURCE PRODUCTIVITY Urbanization is expected to continue, with more than two- thirds of the world's population likely to live in urban areas by 2050, leading to a net urban influx of approximately 2.5 billion people. Existing infrastructure must be equipped to address this dramatic urban growth while also adapting to potential adverse impacts of climate change and other natural hazards. To be sustainable, cities must themselves, become efficient users of materials and energy as well as respond to future climatic conditions. Two main urban engineering strategies are to map how current stocks may respond to climate change and to identify resources that could be used to improve local productive capacity and reduce dependencies on distant resources. The dissertation herein addresses these two overarching strategies through a series of specific case studies for the Boston area using GIS based urban stock assessment as a framework.

Oxygen isotopes may be used in conjunction with selenium isotopes to provide a more complete picture of selenium cycling. The immobilization of selenate via reduction by the layered double hydroxide (LDH) chloride green rust was found to cause a fractionation in the oxygen isotope of selenate, resulting in enrichment of the heavier isotope (22.7%0) much larger than the one identified for selenium isotopes for reduction by green rust. The biotic reduction of selenate by the bacterium Sulfurospirillum barnesii resulted in enrichment of the heavy oxygen isotope (1.5-5.8%0) that was distinct from the value found for reduction by green rust, indicating that these isotopes may be useful for distinguishing between the two dominant methods of selenate reduction in natural systems. These experiments also suggest that mass transfer prior to reduction may have a muting effect on fractionation of the oxygen isotope. Kinetic questions raised by the isotope work with chloride green rust were addressed through sorption experiments of selenate and selenite by the non-reducing LDH pyroaurite.
