Attached for convenient reference is a copy of the CPRA (Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 6250-6276.48).2 Also attached is a copy of the Richard McKee Transparency Act (Educ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 72690-72701, 89913-89919, 92950-92961),3 as well as the following communication relating to the study: Exhibit p. Robert E. Griffin, San Luis Obispo (1/22/17) ....................... 1 TIMING In its resolution containing the Commission's current Calendar of Topics, the Legislature authorizes and requests that the California Law Revision Commission study, report on, and prepare recommended legislation as soon as possible, considering the commission's preexisting duties and workload demands, concerning the revision of the portions of the California Public Records Act and related provisions ....4 1. See 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (ACR 148 (Chau)). Any California Law Revision Commission document referred to in this memorandum can be obtained from the Commission. Recent materials can be downloaded from the Commission's website (www.clrc.ca.gov). Other materials can be obtained by contacting the Commission's staff, through the website or otherwise. The Commission welcomes written comments at any time during its study process. Any comments received will be a part of the public record and may be considered at a public meeting. However, comments that are received less than five business days prior to a Commission meeting may be presented without staff analysis. 2. Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the Government Code. 3. The Richard McKee Transparency Act was enacted in 2011. Aside from technical amendments of Education Code Sections 72699 and 89918 (made by 2012 Cal. Stat. ch. 162, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 43), it has not been revised since its enactment. 4. See 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (ACR 148 (Chau)) (emphasis added). - 2 - From the italicized language, it is clear that the Legislature wants the Commission to treat the CPRA study as a high priority matter. Thus, in the Commission's recent review of new topics and priorities, it decided to begin working on the CPRA study right away.5 The Commission should continue to give this study high priority, and move forward on the topic as promptly as its resources permit. OBJECTIVES The Legislature asked the Commission to achieve a number of objectives in crafting proposed legislation in this study. Specifically, that legislation must accomplish all of the following: (1) Reduce the length and complexity of current sections. (2) Avoid unnecessary cross-references. (3) Neither expand nor contract the scope of existing exemptions to the general rule that records are open to the public pursuant to the current provisions of the Public Records Act. (4) To the extent compatible with (3), use terms with common definitions. (5) Organize the existing provisions in such a way that similar provisions are located in close proximity to one another. (6) Eliminate duplicative provisions. (7) Clearly express legislative intent without any change in the substantive provisions ....6 Need For This Type of Clean-Up If one takes the time to carefully review the current statutory scheme, it becomes readily apparent that the CPRA is due for the type of attention requested by the Legislature. For example, Section 6254 is a classic overlong statute. It spans ten pages in the attached copy of the CPRA, with subdivisions numbered from (a) to (z) followed by (aa) to (ad), most of which are split into numerous paragraphs, subparagraphs, and even some unnumbered provisions.7 Overlong statutes are problematic for a number of different reasons,8 but Section 5. See Draft Minutes (Dec. 2016), pp. 3-4; see also Memorandum 2016-53, pp. 3-4, 43-44, 45. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. (ACR 148 (Chau)). 7. See CPRA Attachment pp. 11-20. 8. See Nonsubtantive Reorganization of Deadly Weapon Statutes, 38 Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports 217, 238-40 (2009). - 3 - 6254 suffers from an additional flaw: It conglomerates many substantively different exemptions and disclosure requirements (and various qualifications of, and limitations on, those requirements), while omitting some material that relates to key substantive provisions.9 Stanford Law School professor Michael Asimow (a Commission consultant on several studies of administrative law) probably had provisions like Section 6254 in mind when he recently welcomed the staff to the CPRA world and said: \"Definitely, this is a great subject for the CLRC as the present statute is a patchwork mess.\"10 Nonsubstantive Nature of the Project In assigning this study, the Legislature made abundantly clear that the Commission's work is to be entirely nonsubstantive in nature. It specifically directed the Commission to \"[n]either expand nor contract the scope of existing exemptions to the general rule that records are open to the public pursuant to the current provisions of the Public Records Act.\"11 The Legislature also asked the Commission to \"use terms with common definitions,\" but only \"[t]o the extent compatible\" with the requirement to \"[n]either expand nor contract the scope of existing exemptions ....\"12 It further instructed the Commission to \"[c]learly express legislative intent without any change in the substantive provisions.\"13 Analyses of the legislative resolution assigning the study, prepared while it was pending, underscore the nonsubstantive nature of the assignment. For example, the Assembly Floor analysis explains: Given the CLRC's experience in clarifying the law without affecting its substance, a request to reduce the complexity of the California Public Records Act seems appropriate.... The CPRA, signed into law in 1968 as a general record keeping law, allows the public to monitor government activity. Since the enactment of the CPRA, it has been amended multiple times to exempt certain records.... Due to the multiple changes to the statute, the CPRA has become difficult for the public to understand. In the past, the CLRC has provided hundreds of recommendations, ranging from the creation of entire codes to the repeal of a single section. Given the CLRC's experience and 9.

(emphasis added). - 4 - expertise in clarifying the law while maintaining the Legislature's intent, it appears reasonable and consistent with the CLRC work that the Legislature asks the CLRC to also review the CPRA to determine whether it should be revised in a non-substantive manner to reduce its length and complexity, avoid unnecessary cross-references, and eliminate duplicative provisions.14 A purely nonsubstantive approach is critical in this area, because there are many contentious issues relating to the CPRA. To give just a few examples, There are ongoing discussions about de-unification of the State Bar, prompted in part by concerns over whether CPRA requirements should apply to State Bar Sections.15 There have been recent bills about applying the CPRA to charter schools.16 A recent California Supreme Court decision addressed whether litigation invoices sent to a county by an outside law firm are subject to disclosure under the CPRA.17 A case pending before the California Supreme Court concerns whether a written communication sent or received by a public official or employee using a private electronic device is subject to the CPRA if the communication pertains to city business.18 A 2010 speech by Sarah Palin at CSU Stanislaus prompted debates and legislation about invoking the CPRA to obtain speaking contracts (and other contracts) from CSU auxiliaries and certain other quasi-public entities.19 To avoid creating concerns over its proposed legislation, the Commission will need to (1) stick closely to the existing language of the CPRA and (2) use the 14.

Sess.). - 5 - other techniques it has developed over the years to ensure that a recodification effects no substantive change.20 Additional Guiding Principles for Preparing the Commission's Recommendation In addition to complying with the legislative directive to make no substantive change, the Commission may wish to follow a few other guiding principles in conducting this study. In particular, in its study on recodifying the Fish and Game Code, the Commission recently determined that a proposed change should only be considered for inclusion in the proposed law if it meets all three of the following criteria: (1) It is plainly beneficial. (2) It does not present a significant risk of unintended consequences (i.e., its effects seem straightforward and circumscribed). (3) It is not likely to be controversial.21 These three criteria \"are grounded in pragmatic concerns about the difficulty of achieving enactment\" of a bulky recodification bill.22 \"With a proposal of this type and size, the Legislature needs to receive a noncontroversial bill, so that it can focus its analytical resources on the primary purpose of the bill: to make the [statutory material] easier to use and understand.\"23 When it adopted the above criteria for use in the Fish and Game study, the Commission indicated that they \"should probably be used in any future technical clean-up project.\"24 Would the Commission like to apply the three criteria shown above in its study of the CPRA? SCOPE OF STUDY The legislative resolution instructs the Commission to \"study, report on, and prepare recommended legislation ... concerning the revision of the portions of the 20.

Those issues are discussed in order below. Which Statutory Provisions to Include in the Study As originally introduced, the legislative resolution instructed the Commission to \"study, report on, and prepare recommended legislation ... concerning the revision of the portions of the Government Code relating to public records ....\"26 The Commission raised questions about that language and asked the staff to \"investigate whether the scope of the study is limited to the four corners of the Public Records Act or would also include closely-related law located elsewhere in the codes ....\"27 For example, the Commission was interested in whether the study would encompass the Education Code provisions added in 2011 governing access to records of CSU auxiliaries and certain other quasi-public entities (known as \"The Richard McKee Transparency Act of 2011\").28 It was also unclear whether the study was supposed to relate solely to public records inspection law, or should also encompass other aspects of public records law, such as records management.29 After the staff raised those questions with legislative staff, the resolution was amended to include the current language, which directs the Commission to \"study, report on, and prepare recommended legislation ... concerning the revision of the portions of the California Public Records Act and related provisions ....\" Thus, the study does not appear to be limited to provisions in the Government Code, but does appear to be limited to public records inspection law, not other aspects of public records law. The bill analyses seem to be consistent with that 25. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (ACR 148 (Chau)) (emphasis added). 26. ACR 148 (Chau), as introduced on March 3, 2016. 27.

Consistent with that approach, the Commission will need to specifically resolve whether to include the Richard McKee Transparency Act within the scope of this study. That Act incorporates some CPRA provisions by reference31 and also contains other provisions relating to record inspection. A copy of the Act is attached for the Commission to consider.32 The Commission has received a message from Robert E. Griffin encouraging it to include the Richard McKee Transparency Act within the scope of the Commission's study.33 He says that the Act \"has represented an awkward and largely unnecessarily detailed overlay of the CPRA\" and auxiliary organizations \"struggle to reconcile its requirements with those under the CPRA used by the CSU and its campuses.\"34 He urges the Commission to \"give the McKee Act a close read and ... consider its relationship to the CPRA.\"35 He believes that it \"represents precisely\" the type of issues associated with the objectives of the Commission's study.36 The staff is still gaining familiarity with the Richard McKee Transparency Act, but tentatively recommends including it within the Commission's study. Does the Commission want to take that approach? The staff is also beginning to review the codes to determine which other provisions warrant attention in this study. We welcome advice on that matter. How to Handle Article 2 of the CPRA (Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 6275-6276.48) Article 1 \u00a7\u00a7 6250-6270.5) is entitled \"General Provisions.\" This article consists of substantive provisions governing access to public records. 30. See Senate Committee on Judiciary Analysis of ACR 148 (Chau) (June 13, 2016); Senate Floor Analysis of ACR 148 (Chau) (Aug. 15, 2016); Assembly Floor Analysis of ACR 148 (Chau) (Aug. 18, 2016). 31. See Educ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 72695, 89915.5, 92955. 32. The Richard McKee Transparency Act was enacted in 2011. Aside from technical amendments of Education Code Sections 72699 and 89918 (made by 2012 Cal. Stat. ch. 162, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 43), it has not been revised since its enactment. 33. See Exhibit. 34. Id. 35. Id. 36. Id. - 8 - Article 2 of the CPRA (Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 6275-6276.48) is entitled \"Other Exemptions from Disclosure.\" This article is quite unusual. It begins with the following statement of legislative intent: It is the intent of the Legislature to assist members of the public and state and local agencies in identifying exemptions to the California Public Records Act. It is the intent of the Legislature that, after January 1, 1999, each addition or amendment to a statute that exempts any information contained in a public record from disclosure pursuant to subdivision (k) of Section 625437 shall be listed and described in this article pursuant to a bill authorized by a standing committee of the Legislature to be introduced during the first year of each session of the Legislature. The statutes and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions thereof, from disclosure. The statutes and constitutional provisions listed and described may not be inclusive of all exemptions. The listing of a statute or constitutional provision in this article does not itself create an exemption. Requesters of public records and public agencies are cautioned to review the applicable statute or constitutional provision to determine the extent to which it, in light of the circumstances surrounding the request, exempts public records from disclosure.38 The article is thus intended to be a tool to assist persons in locating CPRA exemptions. It lists exemptions created in other code provisions (mostly located outside the CPRA), rather than creating any exemptions itself. The next provision in Article 2 makes clear that the article's list of exemptions is not necessarily complete. It states that \"[r]ecords or information not required to be disclosed pursuant to subdivision (k) of Section 6254 may include, but shall not be limited to, records or information identified in statutes listed in this article.\"39 The remainder of the article consists of the list of CPRA exemptions. It starts with a code section that refers to an exemption located in the California Constitution.40 The article then lists numerous statutory exemptions. That list 37. Section 6254(k) provides as follows: 6254. Except as provided in Sections 6254.7 and 6254.13, this chapter does not require the disclosure of any of the following records: .... (k) Records, the disclosure of which is exempted or prohibited pursuant to federal or state law, including, but not limited to, provisions of the Evidence Code relating to privilege. 38.

The staff does not know how well the list in Article 2 (hereafter, the \"CPRA Index\") is serving its intended purpose. Input on that point would be extremely helpful. In the course of studying the CPRA, the Commission will need to decide what to do with Article 2. Should it recommend that the Legislature retain and continue to update the article each legislative session? Should the provisions currently listed in Article 2 but located outside the CPRA be moved into the CPRA, thus separating them from the substantive material that currently surrounds them? Should Article 2 be repealed and replaced with another statutory tool that serves a similar function? Should Article 2 simply be repealed, without replacing it? The Commission does not have to resolve these questions yet, but it will need to do so soon. We much encourage comments on this matter. METHODOLOGY The Legislature did not prescribe any special methodology for the Commission to use in its study of the CPRA. Presumably, the Legislature intended for the Commission to use its normal study process, which is careful, deliberative, and time-tested. Several aspects of that process are discussed below. - 11 - General Description of Study Process The Commission's study process is described in detail in its Annual Report.41 Sometimes the Commission hires a consultant (usually a law professor) to prepare a background study before the Commission begins considering a topic. Because this particular study will be purely technical in nature and the Legislature has expressed some urgency, the background research will be done by the staff, not by a consultant. Interested persons are invited to bring relevant materials to the staff's attention. In conducting a study, the Commission holds a series of public meetings, at which it makes decisions about how to proceed (what issues to investigate, what reforms to propose, how those reforms should be drafted, and the like). Before each meeting, the staff prepares and distributes a memorandum that serves as the basis for discussion at the meeting. These memoranda are posted on the Commission's website at <www.clrc.ca.gov>. By following the instructions at <http://www.clrc.ca.gov/G400.html>, interested persons can subscribe to receive the memoranda for this study electronically as they are generated; persons can also request to be on the Commission's traditional mailing list. After becoming familiar with a topic and making preliminary decisions, preparation of a tentative recommendation begins. A tentative recommendation has three main components: (1) proposed legislation, (2) a Commission Comment to each section of the proposed legislation, and (3) a narrative explanation of the reform (the \"preliminary part\"). The tentative recommendation is widely circulated to interested persons for comment. The comment period is usually about three months. During the comment period, it is just as important for an interested person to express support for the proposal as it is to express disapproval. The Commission then considers the comments at one or more public meetings and determines what, if any, recommendation it will make to the Legislature. The Commission will often substantially revise a proposal in response to comment it receives. After the Commission approves a final recommendation, the proposal must go through the same legislative process as any other legislative proposal. The 41. The Commission's 2014-2015 Annual Report is available in preprint format at http://www.clrc.ca.gov/pub/Printed-Reports/Pub239-AR14.pdf. See in particular pages 14-22. For further information on the Commission's study process, see http://www.clrc.ca.gov/Menu5_about/process.html; see also Barbara Gaal, Evidence Legislation in California, 36 Sw. Univ. L. Rev. 561, 563-69 (2008). - 12 - staff provides the Commission's final recommendation (including the proposed legislation, Commission Comments, and preliminary part) to the policy committees and the Governor. It is properly regarded as legislative history, indicative of legislative intent.42 The process of preparing a final recommendation, even on a narrow, simple, and straightforward topic, takes a minimum of a year, often several years. Then it generally takes at least another year before the proposal is enacted. Legislation generally becomes operative on January 1st of the year following its enactment.43 Participation By Interested Persons The Commission's longstanding practice is to welcome participation by any interested individual or organization in its study process. All Commission meetings are open to the public and members of the public are given opportunities to participate in the discussion. Written comments can be submitted at any time, by mail, email, or other method of delivery. Comments relating to this study should be directed to Barbara Gaal or Steve Cohen. Their contact information is as follows: Barbara Gaal Steve Cohen California Law Revision Comm'n California Law Revision Comm'n 4000 Middlefield Road, Room D-2 c/o UC Davis School of Law Palo Alto, CA 94303 Davis, CA 95616 Email: <bgaal@clrc.ca.gov> Email: <scohen@clrc.ca.gov> Comments received shortly before a Commission meeting may not be analyzed and considered as thoroughly as comments received well in advance. Comments are especially encouraged and solicited during the comment period on a tentative recommendation. Persons or organizations with limited resources may want to focus on providing comments at this stage of the Commission's study. Efforts to Build the Mailing List for This Study The staff is still in the process of building its electronic and traditional mailing lists for this study. The Commission has not previously worked on the CPRA, so it does not already have a suitable mailing list in place. 42. See 2014-2015 Annual Report, supra note 41, at 16-22 & cases cited therein. 43. See Cal. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 8(c)(1); Gov't Code \u00a7 9600(a). - 13 - Suggestions about persons and organizations to include on the mailing list would be helpful. In a future memorandum, we will update the Commission on our progress and efforts to reach out to stakeholders. Code Organization and Statutory Numbering Scheme In conducting this study, the Commission will need to consider the best means of reorganizing the CPRA and related material. That almost certainly will entail renumbering and relocating some provisions, because Article 1 of the CPRA is currently a jumble of substantive material. It might also be advisable to add more articles to the chapter that contains the CPRA, or make other revisions to the hierarchy within the Government Code. It is too early for the Commission to make any decisions about precisely how to reorganize the CPRA and related material. Stakeholders may be interested to know, however, that when the Commission proposes to relocate statutory material, it routinely also proposes a provision designed to ease the transition to the new numbering scheme. For example, the following Penal Code provision was enacted into law in conjunction with the Commission's recent recodification of the deadly weapons statutes: 16010. (a) A provision of this part or of Title 2 (commencing with Section 12001) of Part 4, or any other provision of the Deadly Weapons Recodification Act of 2010, insofar as it is substantially the same as a previously existing provision relating to the same subject matter, shall be considered as a restatement and continuation thereof and not as a new enactment. (b) A reference in a statute to a previously existing provision that is restated and continued in this part or in Title 2 (commencing with Section 12001) of Part 4, or in any other provision of the Deadly Weapons Recodification Act of 2010, shall, unless a contrary intent appears, be deemed a reference to the restatement and continuation. (c) A reference in a statute to a provision of this part or of Title 2 (commencing with Section 12001) of Part 4, or any other provision of the Deadly Weapons Recodification Act of 2010, which is substantially the same as a previously existing provision, shall, unless a contrary intent appears, be deemed to include a reference to the previously existing provision. The Commission could include a similar provision in its recodification of the CPRA and related provisions. Is the staff correct in assuming that the Commission would like to include such a provision? - 14 - Reference Materials The staff is still coming up to speed on this new topic. We would appreciate suggestions regarding any treatises, reference works, or other background materials that might be useful in conducting the study. PENDING BILLS Some pending bills would make revisions relating to the CPRA.44 The Commission's study will not interfere with those bills; it should not have any impact on their fate or the fate of any future bills. The role of the Commission is simply to make recommendations to the Legislature on topics assigned to it for study. The Commission does not take positions on legislation proposed by others. If CPRA-related legislation is enacted while the Commission is conducting this study, the Commission will take the new legislation into account in developing its proposal. If CPRA-related legislation is pending at the same time that the Commission's proposal is pending, any bill conflict could be resolved through bill coordination amendments. NEXT STEPS Unless the Commission otherwise instructs, the staff's next step will be to work on a proposed outline for reorganization of the CPRA and related provisions. This outline will be very tentative and preliminary in nature, because it will still be necessary for the Commission to address and resolve some fundamental issues (e.g., identifying all of the statutory provisions to include and determining how to handle Article 2 of the CPRA). Respectfully submitted, Steve Cohen Staff Counsel Barbara Gaal Chief Deputy Counsel 44. For example, SB 29 (Lara) (as introduced on Dec. 5, 2016) would specify that any facility that detains an immigrant pursuant to a contract with a city, county, city and county, or a local law enforcement agency is subject to the CPRA. Similarly, AB 73 (Chiu & Cabellero) (as introduced on Dec. 16, 2016) would specify that certain monthly reports are public records under the CPRA and shall be open to public inspection. - i- CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT (GOV'T CODE \u00a7\u00a7 6250-6276.48) TABLE OF CONTENTS TITLE 1.

EMAIL FROM ROBERT E. GRIFFIN (1/22/17) Re: California Public Records Act Clean-Up \u2014 CLRC Study G-400 Barbara & Steve: In 2011, the State Legislature enacted The Richard McKee Transparency Act of 2011 -- SB 8 (Stats, 2011, c. 247, Sec 2.), adding Education Code Sections 89913 to 89919. This law has represented an awkward and largely unnecessarily detailed overlay of the CPRA. The auxiliary organizations under McKee struggle to reconcile its requirements with those under the CPRA used by the CSU and its campuses. I urge you to give the McKee Act a close read and and consider its relationship to the CPRA. The McKee Act represents precisely the Chapter 150, Statutes of 2016 issues associated with the objectives of Study G-400. It is respectfully requested that staff urge the Commission to consider the McKee Act (as \"related provisions\") requiring evaluation as part of Study G-400. Please let me know if I can provide any additional background or supplemental information. Your reply to this email-request would be appreciated. Robert E. Griffin Post Office Box 345 San Luis "}
