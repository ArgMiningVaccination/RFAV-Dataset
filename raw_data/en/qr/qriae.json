Evidence is accruing that shows aging impairs normal immune responses, and there is intense interest in how this impacts on systemic disease, such as cancer. Immunosenescence in aging also directly underpins an impaired response to common infections, and this may be compounded further by onset of systemic disease, especially disease of a hematological nature. This thesis focuses on monoclonal gammopathy of undermined significance (MGUS), a non-malignant lymphoproliferative plasma cell condition and how it impacts on immunity in aging, using responses to influenza vaccination as a read-out. In MGUS, plasma cells accrue to <10% of the bone marrow, the primary disease niche and is characterized by the presence of a serum monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein) (<30g/L). IgG is the predominant M protein isotype with more than 60% of cases being IgG, 19% IgM, 17% IgA, biclonal [1]. a subtype of MGUS in which the secreted M protein lacks IgH has been defined as light-chain MGUS, occurs in approximately 0.8 % of the population aged over 50 years [1, 2]. Overall, MGUS is associated with advancing age and has a prevalence of >5% in people over 70 with less than 2% of MGUS patients falling under the age of 40 [3]. It has always been recognized that some cases of MGUS will progress to malignant symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM), but recent and seminal studies have shown that MM is consistently preceded by MGUS [4,5]. Thus, MGUS and MM are two different phases of the same disease, but with profoundly differing outcomes and impact on immune status, and response to infection and vaccination. FROM PR ECURSOR DIS EASE TO MULTIPLE MYELOMA MGUS pathogenesis The aetiology of MGUS is as yet unknown. However, several observations point towards the role of environmental factors and genetic predisposition in the development of MGUS. The rate of MGUS varies strikingly with race. MGUS is more prevalent in African Americans and Africans (Ghananians) with a risk ratio of 2 to 3 compared to whites [6,7].The cumulative risk of MM is similar in these MGUS populations, indicating an increased risk of MGUS in blacks that may partly explain the higher incidence rate of MM in African Americans. The lowest incidences of MGUS are found in the Japanese population [8,9]. Possibly, the higher risk of MGUS in blacks also reflects unidentified environmental influences, which may interact CHAPTER 112 with genetic factors. There is also evidence for familial aggregation for MGUS and MM. Healthy relatives of MM patients have been reported to have an elevated incidence of immunoglobulin abnormalities, without any other signs of plasma cell lymphoproliferative disorders [10]. In a study of 304 MGUS and 407 MM patients, first degree family members of MGUS or MM patients were found to have at least a 2-fold greater risk of MGUS compared to the general population [11]. The prevalence of MGUS in first degree relatives increased with age and in relatives over 80 was higher (13%) than in the general population (7%). A larger Swedish population based study of 4,458 MGUS patients and their relatives (n=14,621) as well as 17 505 healthy control subjects and their relatives (n= 58,387) assessed the risk of MGUS and lymphoproliferative malignancies among first degree relatives. MGUS relatives had a 3-fold increased risk of developing MGUS and MM compared to the relatives of healthy controls [12]. The precise role of environmental and genetic factors in the development of MGUS and MM however needs to be fully defined. Despite its apparent 'benign' manifestation, there are marked primary cytogenic changes in MGUS that are shared with MM. In both, disease forms two broad subsets, hyperdiploid and non-hyperdiploid disease. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has identified IgH translocations in approximately 50% of MGUS and 50-70% of MM [13]. Approximately 50% of MGUS is associated with IgH translocations, the remaining 50% is associated with hyperdiploid or IgH non-translocated MGUS [13]. Translocations involving the IgH on chromosome 14q32 result in the juxtapositioning and aberrant expression of the oncogene translocated to the IgH locus under the influence of strong transcriptional enhancers (ref - cite Bergasgel review). Chromosomal translocations usually occur near or within IgH switch regions, and may be mediated primarily by errors in IgH switch recombination or by errors in somatic hypermutation, resulting in the dysregulation of oncogenes on the derivative chromosomes [15]. These aberrations are considered to be a critical step in the development of the MGUS clone, and it has been suggested that they immortalize the MGUS clone but do not promote progression to clinical symptomatic disease. In progression to malignancy, the premalignant clone in some cases escapes the regulatory mechanisms that restrict its size and progression to MM or other plasma cell disorder occurs. The progression occurs at a constant rate of 1% per year but the sequences of genomic and cellular events associated with progression are not fully defined as yet The bone marrow microenvironment also undergoes marked changes with progression from MGUS to MM, and plays a defining role in transformation [16]. Indeed, bone marrow angiogenesis increases significantly in the advanced stages of the disease due to loss of angiogenesis inhibitory activity [17]. Furthermore, INTRODUCT ION 113 various cytokines including IL-6 and TNF- D have been implicated in progression to MM [18]. IL-1 E produced by the myeloma cells induces IL-6 secretion by bone marrow stromal cells, which in turn supports the growth and survival of the myeloma cells, but also contributes to development of skeletal disease, diagnostic for MM disease [20]. The development of bone lesions is mediated by the imbalanced activity of osteoblasts (bone forming) and osteoclasts (bone resorping) in MM. Increased expression of RANKL A multi-step process from stable MGUS clone to progressive malignant myeloma tumor. In the asymptomatic phase of monoclonal gammopathy, MGUS, patients have elevated levels of monoclonal protein and may remain stable for many years. Smoldering multiple myeloma is the disease transition phase between MGUS and MM. However, some MGUS patients may skip this stage and progress straight to malignant multiple myeloma. The dotted line represents healthy individuals who are diagnosed with multiple myeloma after showing symptoms and with no previous serum protein electrophoresis carried out to check for M-protein. BM; bone marrow, , FLC; free 114 by osteoblasts is accompanied by a reduction in the level of its decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin (OPG) [21]. As a result RANKL/OPG ratio is increased leading to osteoclast activation, increased bone resorption and turnover. Furthermore, osteoclast overactivity is also mediated by increased levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-1 D (MIP-1 D) and IL-6 [22]. Predictors of progression from precursor MGUS disease to MM It is imperative to identify MGUS patients who will progress to clinical malignant MM disease. However, at present it is difficult to predict which MGUS patients will progress to MM at the time of diagnosis and reliable biologic markers that allow us to predict progression are lacking. Several clinical markers are associated with higher risk of progression. Serum levels of monoclonal protein are a prognostic factor with levels >15g/L associated with higher risk [23,24]. The evolving pattern of monoclonal protein at the first 3 years of follow-up is also an important prognostic factor with increasing levels in MGUS being associated with higher risk of progression [24]. However, stable monoclonal protein does not exclude the development of MM [3]. The immunoglobulin isotype is a further independent predictor of progression with IgA and IgM MGUS being at a higher risk of progression that IgG MGUS [23,24]. Abnormal free light chain (FLC) ratio is also an independent prognostic factor [25,26]. Using the FLC assay, free kappa ( N) and lambda ( O) light chains can be quantified. Increased concentrations of one free light chain result in kappa/ lambda ratios higher or lower than normal range (0.26-1.65mg/L) depending on the excess FLC secreted by plasma cells in addition to intact immunoglobulin In a risk stratification model; a non-IgG isotype, concentration more than 15 g/L, and an abnormal FLC ratio are considered adverse prognostic factors with the number of risk factors correlating with the progression risk. Indeed, the absolute risk of progression in MGUS patients with 0, 1, 2, and 3 risk factors is 5%, 21%, 37%, and 58%, respectively, at 20 years [26]. Of high clinical relavence in the transition of asymptomatic MGUS to activeMM, key monoclonal gammopathy stages can also be defined, as asymptomatic smoldering MM (SMM), plateau phase disease and active disease. SMM is distinguished from MGUS by higher cutoff values with serum M-protein 30 g/l and/or bone marrow clonal plasma cells 10% while maintaining a lack of end-organ damage. Despite MGUS and SMM being both asymptomatic precursors of MM, they differ from each other as the risk of progression to MM is much higher in SMM (10% per year) as compared to MGUS (1% per year)[27, 28] . This 10-fold increased risk alone suggests that SMM differs biologically to MGUS. Although recent therapies and better supportive care have improved the survival of MM, it as yet remains incurable in most cases [median survival 4-5 years] providing further impetus to define the pathogenesis and progression of disease, to inform therapy including immunotherapy [29, 30]. INTRODUCT ION 115 CLINICAL MANA GEMENT AND TREATMENT INTERVENTION IN MGUS Currently no treatment is recommended for patients with MGUS; rather patients are monitored and observed at 6 months to 2 yearly intervals for changes in their clinical and immunochemical status until they progress to MM before treatment is started. The International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) guidelines suggest monitoring of MGUS patients based on risk category [31]. Low-risk L, normal FLC ratio followed at 6 months with serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), calcium and creatinine measurements as well as complete blood count. If they remain stable, they are monitored every 2-3 years thereafter. However check-up should be carried out if symptoms of MM arise [31]. In patients with intermediate or high-risk MGUS, that is with any 2 or 3 risk factors respectively, a bone marrow examination by conventional cytogenics and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) should be carried out so as to rule out underlying malignancy. Patients are then followed in 6 months and then monitored annually. Preventative studies for MGUS need to consider the risk of progression to malignancy and should be aimed at patients who are at the highest risk of progression. Amongst the first preventative studies directly in MGUS is the report by Golombick et al in which curcumin was administered derived from turmeric ( Curcuma longa ), a tropical herb that belongs to the ginger family and is native to southern and south eastern tropical Asia [33]. Curcumin inhibits the proliferation of MM cells by downregulating IL-6, an important growth factor for myeloma cells, and inhibits osteoclastogenesis by the suppression of RANKL signaling [22,34]. In the study by Golombick et al, 4g daily curcumin reduced M-protein levels by 12 to 30% in 50% of patients with M-protein levels 20g/L and a decrease in bone resorption was also indicated in some patients [35]. The same group further conducted a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled crossover 4g study, followed by an open-label extension 8 g study to investigate the effects of curcumin on paraproteinemia, serum-free light chains, and bone turnover in MGUS and SMM patients [36]. Curcumin administration decreased and urinary deoxypyridinoline (uDPYD), a marker of bone resorption in comparison to the placebo group [36]. However, the effect on progression to symptomatic disease was not reported. Clinical trials with curcumin remain as preliminary studies. Other placebo controlled clinical trials with dehydroepiandiosterone (DHEA), an adrenal sex hormone, that has anti-inflammatory properties such as suppression of inflammatory cytokine production as well as with Clarithromycin, an antibiotic, were carried out at Mayo clinic in patients with MGUS [37]. Other agents like anakinra, a targeted IL-1 receptor antagonist, green tea catechin extract (Polyphenon E) and celecoxib are subjects of investigation (clinicaltrial.gov).CHAPTER 116 The development of novel therapies with less cytoxicity has renewed the interest in early treatment at the SMM disease stage. Thalidomide, an anti- inflammatory, antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory drug has been trialed in SMM and prewviously untreated MM and achieved partial response in 38% of 16 patients [38]. Furthermore, a phase 3 trial with lenalidomide-dexamethasone in SMM reported a longer till till progression as well as higher survival rates in the treated group versus observational group. Response was achieved in 79% after induction therapy [39]. Therapeutic clinical trials in asymptomatic individuals with MGUS/SMM pose a challenge to researchers. However, identifying the right target group at highest risk for progression may prove to be of great benefit in preventing onset of MM. IMMU NE STATUS IN MGUS The outcome of progression in MGUS not only depends on the pre-malignant clone but also on its interaction with other cells and the microenvironment. In this, the host immune response to the lymphoproliferative clone thwarts progression, but eventually is overcome as generally observed in the equilibrium-escape phases in cancer. However, MGUS-MM also directly influences immune capacity, as apparent in response to infection. These aspects are central to this thesis, and are discussed further below. Excess mortality due to bacterial infections has been reported in MGUS [40]. Other than an increased risk of a broad range of bacterial infections that include pneumonia, osteomyelitis, septicemia, pyelonephritis, endocarditis and meningitis, MGUS also has increased risk of developing viral infections herpes zoster and influenza [41]. The increased risk of developing infections may have clinical importance for vaccination as well as for monitoring of MGUS patients. Specifically for influenza where the changing nature of the major influenza antigen means that yearly revaccination with a new circulating strain is required, and vaccination in high risk groups is of considerable importance [42]. However, data concerning the safety and efficacy of influenza vaccination is lacking in MGUS. Because of the increased susceptibility of MGUS patients to influenza infections, it has been questioned whether these patients can mount sufficient immunological response to benefit from vaccination. We investigate this question directly in this thesis, and assess its implications. NORMAL IMMU NE RESPONSE TO INFLUENZA INFECT ION Influenza virus entrance is through the respiratory tract, which is also the site of replication. The mucosal system is therefore the first immunological barrier against influenza infection. The nasopharyx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) that consists of the Waldeyer's ring, an organized mucosal inductive site, is important in INTRODUCT ION 117 the induction of the mucosal immune response together with the regional draining lymph nodes [43,44]. Upon infection with influenza virus, several components of the innate immune system are triggered and mediate viral clearance [45]. Macrophage viral clearance is through apoptosis-dependent phagocytosis [46]. In addition, macrophages secrete IL-2 which induces natural killer (NK) cell IFN- J production. These NK cells are detected 2 hours after infection in pulmonary lymphocytes [47]. Type-1 IFNs secreted by NK cells enhance NK cell mediated cytoxicity important for inhibiting viral replication. Importantly, the NK cell receptor, NKp46 binds to hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus to activate the lysis of virus-infected cells [48]. Following escape of the innate immune clearance, the influenza virus is detected by the adaptive immune system. Dendritic cells (DC) also migrate into or converge under the epithelia of nose and airways where they capture antigen [49]. DCs migrate to draining lymph nodes so as to present antigen to T cells [44] leading to T cell activation. Myeloid DCs are crucial in antigen presentation but have limited type1 IFN production [50]. However, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are a major source of type 1 IFN and are important for influenza response [51] as they can activate influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [52]. Importantly, pDCs play a role in normal B cell maturation into plasmablasts as well as regulating their differentiation to antibody secreting plasma cells through type 1 IFNs and IL-6 [53,54]. NK cells also interact with DCs to activate innate immunity and promote adaptive immune responses to influenza [55,56]. NKG2D and NKp46 contribute to increased IFN- J influenza- specific DC-activated NK cells [55]. Furthermore, IFN- J production by NK cells is also T-cell dependent, with IL-2 produced by virus-specific T cells influencing IFN- J\u0003 production [57]. Follicular T helper cells are the predominant specialized CD4+ T cells responsible for the generation of isotype switched antibodies. Upon antigen encounter via follicular dendritic cells and interaction with helper T cells, na\u00efve B cells that recirculate through secondary lymphoid tissues migrate to follicules where they proliferate and seed germinal centers or migrate to extrafollicular sites [58,59]. TGF- E1 and IL-21 derived from germinal center follicular T helper cells promote the differentiation of antigen activated B cells into IgA plasmablasts with mucosal homing properties [60]. Downregulation of lead to the extravasation of plasma cells from GC to local mucosa [55] while primed B cells leave as memory B cells [61]. Importantly, secretory IgA plays a vital role in response to natural infection as secretory IgA can neutralize influenza viruses before passing the mucosal barrier and clear infection in infected epithelia [62,63]. Nonetheless, induction of local and systemic anti-viral IgG antibody responses is necessary in order to neutralize the virus. Most neutralizing antibodies bind to the exposed loop surrounding the receptor-binding site so as to interfere with attachment [64,65] and peak in the serum 3-4 weeks at primary infection. However, CHAPTER 118 reinfection induces more rapid response. Hemaglutinin (HA) specific antibodies not only prevent HA binding to cell surface sialic acid or prevent viral fusion but also mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytoxicity (ADCC). These ADCC antibodies have been shown to be isotype subtype specific, and broadly reactive antibodies within a subtype persist up to a year after live attenuated influenza vaccination. Interestingly, in sero-positive adults, cross-reactive influenza specific ADCC antibodies trigger NK activation in the absence of neutralizing antibodies [66]. Recovery from viral infection with the antibody response therefore relies on interaction with other immune cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) play a role in recovery from influenza infection by killing of infected host cells, with granzyme E mediated apoptosis [67]. The role of CD8+ T cells in the recovery from infection discerned from studies showing delayed clearance in CD8+ T cell-deficient mice [68,69] as well as studies in B cell deficient mice where CD8+ T cells promote resistance and recovery [70]. CD4+ T cells alone cannot clear the virus efficiently in the absence of B cells but have an indirect role in sustaining the response [71]. A Th1 response due to the production of IFN- J, leads to the recruitment of the CTL response and also provide help for antibody production [67]. NORMAL HUM ORAL RESPONSE TO INFLUENZA VACCINATION The main strategy effective in preventing influenza infection is vaccination with its effectiveness depending on antigenic match to the circulating virus strains. Intranasal vaccination results in increased mucosal as well as serum antibody levels. The induction of mucosal IgA antibodies is important in viral neutralization and preventing infection with IgA antibodies providing heterosubtypic cross- protection [72-74]. In addition to the systemic response on which seasonal vaccination protection is based, parenteral vaccination induces a local immune response in the tonsils [75]. This may result from activated antibody presenting cells migrating from draining lymph nodes and homing to tonsils [76]. The currently used influenza vaccines predominantly activate the systemic immune system and only negligible mucosal IgA. As a result, although vaccination predominantly induces IgG antibody secretion lower levels of IgA and IgM are also detected in the serum [77-79]. The secretion of influenza-specific antibodies by plasmablasts leads to a rise in serum antibodies and in a week following vaccination, a rise in titers of all 3 antibody classes (IgA, IgG and IgM) is detected with IgA and IgM levels peaking after 2 weeks [77,80]. IgG levels on the other hand increase till they reach a peak 4 weeks post vaccination [75,78]. Importantly, the neutralizing IgG antibodies elicited by seasonal influenza vaccination have been shown to be heterosubtypic [81,82]. INTRODUCT ION 119 AIMS OF THIS THESIS While it is clear that pre-malignant conditions occur with high frequency in the aging population, the extent to which MGUS specifically impacts on protective immunity in humans is largely unknown. This thesis therefore examines immune function in MGUS, focusing on impact of disease on humoral responses and on response to inflenza vaccination to model immune capacity against infection, as well as in relation to disease progression to malignant plasma cell disease MM. In Chapter 2 we first review the known immune defects in the literature associated with humoral immunity and risk of infections as well as response to vaccination in MGUS and MM. This provides a back-drop to design and conduct experimental studies to evaluate immune response to influenza vaccination in MGUS. As MGUS is more prevalent with increasing age, a substantial number of the patients fall under the high-risk group of elderly individuals, so they receive seasonal influenza vaccination. Whether this vaccination is effective has not been investigated in MGUS before. In Chapter 3 , we therefore evaluated the immunogenicity of 2010-2011 seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in MGUS patients. 19 MGUS patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria as well as age-matched healthy controls were recruited in this clinical study. The data defines the humoral and Th-1 response to influenza vaccination in relationship to M protein levels in MGUS. In Chapter 4, we investigate the antigen-specific memory B cell responses to influenza vaccination. Memory B cells are of importance in influenza vaccination response as the protective efficacy of the vaccine is largely determined by its ability to elicit a humoral response. Furthermore, we elucidate changes in B-cell subpopulations in blood. We hoped to shed light on whether possible B cell dysregulation in MGUS influences B-cell memory. Since MGUS patients have an enlarged clonal B cell population, which puts them at risk for malignant B cell expansion, we characterized the B cell repertoire in MGUS and matched aged individuals to investigate the impact of MGUS on the B cell repertoire diversity and how it affects response to vaccination (chapter 5) . Using the method of B cell spectratyping, we amplified the CDR3 region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) region genes and modeled data to assess diversity in MGUS patients before and after influenza vaccination. In chapter 6 , we further investigate B cell repertoire usage; we exploited the technology of Next Generation Sequencing to investigate the IgG immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene repertoire in high M protein MGUS. We compared the peripheral B cell repertoire of MGUS with those of HC to investigate if MGUS is associated with a biased immunoglobulin heavy chain gene usage. Furthermore, we investigated the clonal diversity of the repertore and how it affected the response to influenza vaccination.CHAPTER 120 1.

Evidence is revealing that the B-cell compartment and the associated immune synapse in the aging immune response underlie an increased susceptibility to infections and decreased response to vaccination [1]. In age-related immunosenescence, onset of hematological disease may further ameliorate immune capacity, and a combination of these factors has as yet received little attention. To address this, we focus on a non- malignant B-cell clonal expansion in late age, on monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) where plasma cells accrue to <10% of the bone marrow. This condition provides a unique model to understand how immune susceptibility is impaired in aging by disease. The model extends and acquires a further urgency when it is recognized that MGUS almost invariably precedes transformation to malignant multiple myeloma (MM) [2], in which humoral immune capacity deteriorates further. Currently however, how the efficacy of B-cell response to generate protective humoral immunity diminishes in these disease states is largely undefined. Understanding this will be crucial for successful intervention with vaccination to counter infections in MGUS and MM, and reduce the associated morbidity and mortality. Consequently, this review examines B-cell dysfunction in monoclonal disease spanning MGUS to MM. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance incidence increases with advancing age. It is usually diagnosed by chance and is characterized by the presence of a serum monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-protein) (<30 g/L). MGUS is present in of people over 50 years and up to 5% over 70 years [3, 4]. A newly described subtype of MGUS in which the secreted M-protein lacks IgH to skew the free light-chain-(FLC)-ratio, defined as light-chain MGUS, occurs in approximately 0.8% of the population aged over 50 years to establish an overall prevalence of MGUS to 4.2% in persons aged 50 years and older [5, 6]. MGUS requires clinical vigilance, to establish onset of MM. Seminal observations by Landgren and co- workers established that MM patients invariably had a previously recognized M-protein as MGUS during a nationwide population-based cohort screen [2]. These paradigm shifting findings were substantiated by Weiss et al. by detection of a monoclonal gammopathy in prediagnostic sera in 90% of 30 myeloma patients [7]. As yet, it is difficult to accurately predict the subset that will progress in MGUS after initial diagnosed and this remains an important area of investigation [3, 8]. Interestingly, light-chain MGUS is also a precursor of light-chain MM, which comprises 20% of all MM cases; this association has important implications for understanding the nature of the \"feeder\" cell for plasma cell malignancy [9-11]. Furthermore, progression rates differ, as IgH MGUS transforms at the rate of 1% per year but light-chain MGUS has a progression rate of 0.3% per year, which is CHAPTER 230 significantly lower [4, 6, 12]. Of particular relevance to the need to understand immune capacity in disease, it has been established that loss of immune control, among other factors is implicated in malignant transformation from asymptomatic disease to MM [13-16]. The immune status in MGUS and MM therefore needs to be fully understood, for therapeutic intervention to prevent progression and to counter susceptibility to infection. In clinical diagnosis, MGUS lack the overt clinical CRAB symptoms that define MM: hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and bone lesions [11]. In the MGUS-MM transition, key stages of high clinical relevance can also be defined, as asymptomatic smoldering MM (SMM), plateau phase disease, and active disease. SMM fulfills the diagnostic criteria for MM, with serum M-protein 30 g/L and/or bone marrow clonal plasma cells 10% however without clinical CRAB symptoms or end organ damage that dictate therapeutic intervention. Although SMM is an asymptomatic precursor of symptomatic MM, it differs from MGUS as the risk of progression to MM is much higher (10% per year) as compared to MGUS (1% per year) [11, 17]. This 10-fold increased risk alone suggests that SMM differs biologically to MGUS. The SMM-MM transition is at present a focal area of research, driven by the need to understand the molecular and cellular basis of full blown clonal transformation. Although recent therapies and better supportive care have improved the survival of MM, it remains largely incurable (median survival 4-5 years) [18, 19]. THE RISK AN D SPECTRUM OF INFECT IONS IN MGUS AN D MM It is important when assessing susceptibility to infection in MGUS and MM that healthy controls are age-matched, to obviate an aging immunosenescence and this has generally been the case in reported studies. The risk of bacteremia in MGUS is increased ~2-fold as compared to healthy controls, with an increased susceptibility to a broad range of bacterial infections that include pneumonia, osteomyelitis, septicemia, pyelonephritis, endocarditis, and meningitis [20]. In viral infections, MGUS patients have an increased risk of developing influenza and herpes zoster infections at a risk comparable to that for bacterial infections [20]. High monoclonal protein at diagnosis associates with higher risks of infection: MGUS patients with monoclonal protein >25 g/L at diagnosis have the highest risk of infections, and the risk is still significantly increased in MGUS patients with monoclonal protein <5 g/L as compared to healthy controls [20]. M-protein levels are most likely a surrogate for clonal expansion and concomitant immunosuppression. MGUS patients have an increased mortality due to bacterial infections, with a hazard ratio of 3:4 [21]. Depressed antibody titers to a number of common infectious pathogens have been found in several conditions associated with presence of an M-protein. Serum IMMUNE DEFECTS IN THE R ISK OF INFECT ION AND RESPONSE TO VACC INATION... 231 IgG antibody levels directed to 24 different microorganisms were evaluated in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, a lymphoma subtype MGUS and MM [22]. Significantly depressed antibody levels to of antigens, and Aspergillus were observed in MGUS [22]. However, a significant decrease in antibody titers was also observed in WM and MM, revealing that humoral immune response to most of these pathogens is suppressed. There appears to be an increased susceptibility to infections in MGUS that worsens as disease progresses to MM, as indicated by antibody titers. The duration of antibody response and their protective value however varies between different pathogens, with some specific antibody levels that remain stable over a long time. The variability in humoral response to different pathogens indicates a requirement to carefully dissect responses to individual infectious agents in MGUS and MM. There is clear evidence of immune dysfunction in MM that leads to vulnerability to infection, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Lymphocytopenia [23], hypogammaglobulinemia [24], and granulocytopenia secondary to bone marrow infiltration and therapy [25] are factors that are consistently found to increase the susceptibility of MM patients to infections. In a study of 3107 newly diagnosed MM patients in the UK Medical Research Council Trial from 1980 to 2002, infections caused 135 deaths [45%) of all deaths, occurring within 60 days of diagnosis and with two-thirds of these being attributed to pneumonia [26]. The risk of infection is highest in the first 3 months and decreases with response to treatment, revealing a direct causative links as tumor burden is reduced. The most frequent infections are bacteremia and pneumonia caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli [27-29]. These microorganisms predominate in the early stages of disease and in plateau phase, but in the terminal phase of the disease the spectrum of causative microorganisms widens [29, 30]. Recurrent bacterial infections at presentation meet the diagnostic criteria for symptomatic MM [11]. In addition to intrinsic disease-derived factors, the type of therapy used in symptomatic MM also plays a role in susceptibility to infection. Chemotherapy can disrupt the mucosal barriers thereby increasing the risk of infections [31]. Induction therapy for MM has changed recently and the traditional oral melphalan and prednisone (MP) as well as vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone (VAD) combinations better-tolerated, the use of novel therapies results in an increased risk of opportunistic infections as well as the shift in the spectrum of infections in MM. Novel therapeutic agents increase the risk of viral infections; bortezomib therapy for instance, increases the risks of herpes zoster reactivation in the first few months of treatment due to the CHAPTER 232 immunosuppressive effects on T cells [34, 35]. Dexamethasone use is associated with a greater risk of infections, and associates with depressed cell-mediated immunity against cytomegalovirus and varicella-zoster virus [36, 37]. Notably, high-dose dexamethasone is associated with higher rate of infections (18%) in comparison to low-dose dexamethasone (9%), as shown in a randomized controlled trial of newly diagnosed MM [38]. The lack of immune reconstitution due to poor disease response to therapy leaves patients with an on-going immune deficiency that perpetuates their risk of infections. It is also conceivable that infections may have a potential role in enhancing the survival of myeloma cells but this has as yet not been fully addressed. Infections are frequent in MM and microorganisms are known to induce B-cell activation through Toll-like receptors (TLR). MM cells express TLR and TLR-specific ligands have been shown to induce cell proliferation and prevent apoptosis of human myeloma cell lines [39, 40]. This further exemplifies an unwanted tumor adaptation to exploit local niche characteristics. NORMAL AGE-ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN HUMORAL RE SPONSE The immune status of patients with MGUS or MM has to be seen in the light of the aging immune system. Qualitative as well as quantitative changes in the humoral immune response occur with late age. The B-cell repertoire and maturation response are critical in mediating protection against infection [41]. Antigen response in B cells may occur with T-cell help for T-cell-dependent (TD) maturation, or can result in T-cell-independent (TI) antibody formation. Both can generate B-cell memory, although the TD pathway is largely responsible for long-term memory by generating plasma cells that home to and reside in the bone marrow; both pathways are a pre-requisite in vaccination aimed at inducing protective antibody titers [42]. A number of studies have shown a decline in total CD19+ B cells frequencies with age, and shifts in specific B-cell subset populations [43-45]. A decrease in na\u00efve B cells together with memory and plasma cells has been reported [46]. In B-cell memory, the IgM component (CD19+ IgM+ IgD+ CD27+) plays an important role in response to bacterial infections and declines with age [47]. There are also age-related decreases in the IgD CD27+ switched memory B-cell pool [43, 47, 48]. Furthermore, a decrease in the number and percentage of circulating plasma cells is seen with age [49]. Newly arising subpopulations termed \"age-associated B cells,\" defined as CD21low, CD23low, CD11c+ that seem to be more responsive to TLR7 and TLR9 ligands than direct B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation have been described [50] Antigen-specific B cells populations are altered with the changes evident as decreased antibody responses to influenza and pneumococcal vaccination [47, 51]. In mechanistic insights, key observations suggests an intrinsic defect in deletional class switch recombination (CSR) due to decreased expression of activation-IMMUNE DEFECTS IN THE R ISK OF INFECT ION AND RESPONSE TO VACC INATION... 233 induced cytidine deaminase (AID) with age [43, 52]. AID is a pre-requisite for both TD and TI B-cell responses. As a result, weak and low affinity antibody responses are elicited. Induction of sustainable B-cell responses is therefore a challenge in the elderly. Changes in B-cell subpopulations impact on the available repertoire in aging and this has been mapped by spectratyping and gene sequencing studies looking at immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) use. These studies reveal a collapse in BCR diversity due to B-cell oligoclonal expansions that occur with age [53]. Oligoclonality is also associated with poor health status (frailty) [54]. This loss of diversity will clearly impair the B-cell response to new antigenic challenge. Senescence of humoral immunity impairs immunogenicity and efficacy of vaccination with a number of studies providing evidence that age impacts on response [55-57]. Immune response to influenza vaccination declines with age. In young adults, vaccination is 70-90% effective against influenza (protective titers against two or three of the influenza viral strains) especially when the vaccine matches the circulating strains [58, 59]. However, in the elderly population, influenza vaccination is only 60% effective, although it may be up to 80% effective in the prevention of serious influenza complications [60, 61]. Other than the inferior antibody response generated in the elderly in comparison to that of young adults [56, 62], a decreased anti-viral cell-mediated response is also apparent [56]. Infections caused by encapsulated extracellular bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) are an important health issue in aging. The bacterial polysaccharide capsule per se provides a challenge for vaccine design to counter invasive disease. Capsular polysaccharides as antigens do not generate a memory response [63] and the antibody response to polysaccharide vaccine is short-lived [64]. However, polysaccharide vaccines are more immunogenic when conjugated to a carrier protein [65, 66], as a result of the switch from a TI to a TD response. A 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is currently licensed for use in the elderly since they become infected with a broad range of serotypes. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in the elderly remains controversial. In a study by Rubins and colleagues, only 20% of the elderly (>65 years) had a twofold increase in specific antibody following vaccination. Moreover, they did not respond to the most prevalent serotypes causing invasive disease [67]. An earlier study of elderly males showed a response to all seven measured serotypes that was comparable to that of young adults [68]. Other studies have shown that vaccination reduces the incidence of hospitalization and mortality in the elderly [69-71] and is effective in 45% vaccinated individuals in preventing Streptococcus pneumonia infection [70]. Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumonia has the highest prevalence in infants and naturally induced anti-polysaccharide IgG prevents carriage in the CHAPTER 234 adult [72]. However, in the elderly naturally acquired anti-polysaccharide IgG and IgM decrease with age [73], and additional protection is not conferred by simultaneously administering pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations in the elderly [74, 75]. Of the six serotypes of encapsulated Haemophilus influenza , type b is the most virulent, causing invasive diseases such as meningitis, septicemia, and pneumonia. A number of Hib-conjugate vaccines are licensed for use and the estimate of protective anti-Hib polysaccharide antibodies, 0.15-1 g/mL [76, 77], are based on the assumption that protection from invasive disease is solely mediated by antibodies, with negligible contributions of cell-mediated immunity. In the elderly, Hib polysaccharide conjugate vaccine-induced specific IgG antibodies are of comparable affinity as those generated in young adults [78], and Hib polysaccharide conjugate vaccination elicits a strong and rapid response in the elderly that results in protective titers [79]. In addition to diminution of antibody responses, an increase in reactivity toward autologous antigens that leads to autoantibody production in the elderly is indicative of a wider malaise in humoral responses, suggesting loss of tolerogenic control and check-points [80-82]. Alterations in T-cell immunity that can contribute to the development of infections also occur with aging; these thymic atrophy-related changes in T-cell proportions as well as function changes have been reviewed elsewhere [83-85]. IMMU NE DEFECT S IN MGUS AN D MM B-Cell Function B-cell dysfunction is less profound in MGUS than in MM. This can be tracked by studies on uninvolved polyclonal serum immunoglobulins as hypogammaglobulinemia, which reflects the influence of the tumor clone on the spectrum of immunoglobulin production. Hypogammaglobulinemia occurs at a lower frequency in MGUS (25-28%) [3, 86, 87], is more frequent in SMM (45-83%) [17, 88, 89] and is often associated with MM [25, 90]. The frequency of hypogammaglobulinemia associates with disease progression and the reciprocal depression of uninvolved immunoglobulins is a prognostic factor for progression to MM [17, 88, 89, 91, 92]. These findings support the concept that progressive immunodeficiency is a feature of disease progression in MM. B-cell enumeration Circulating CD19+ B cells in MGUS are numerically normal or decreased in comparison to age-matched HCs [93-95]. In MM, the significant depression of circulating CD19+ B-cell frequencies correlates inversely with stage of disease, and coupled with defective cell-mediated immunity in late stage disease contributes to the increased risk of infection [25].IMMUNE DEFECTS IN THE R ISK OF INFECT ION AND RESPONSE TO VACC INATION... 235 Plasma cells are the long-term depots of antibody generating cells in the normal BM. MGUS plasma cells display phenotypic heterogeneity as compared to their normal counterparts. Based on the expression of CD19 and CD56, two distinct subpopulations of plasma cells can be seen. The first population of plasma cells is polyclonal and has an identical phenotype to normal BM plasma cells, observed as CD19+ CD56 CD38+ CD138+. A second population of abnormal plasma cells is characterized by restricted intracytoplasmic light-chain expression and lack of expression of CD19 and/or CD56 [96] These abnormal plasma cells can be detected at low frequencies (limit of detection 0.01% of leukocytes) by using combined immunophenotyping and clonality assessment [97, 98]. Abnormal MGUS clonal plasma cells have the same phenotype as MM clonal plasma cells [99]. There is a progressive replacement of normal BM polyclonal plasma cells by clonal (tumor) plasma cells as disease advances from MGUS to MM [100, 101]. Normal plasma cells have been found to make up to 86% of total BM plasma cells in MGUS and 0-32% in MM [96]. The number of residual polyclonal plasma cells in BM can therefore distinguish between MGUS and MM with 98% MGUS patients having >3% normal plasma cells and only 1.5% MM having >3% normal plasma cells. From these observations alone, it is apparent that normal (polyclonal) long-lived plasma cell memory deteriorates markedly in MM. Not only is the increase in aberrant clonal plasma cell populations likely to impact on normal plasma cell compartment, but also associates with egress into the circulation. The circulating abnormal plasma cells have been found to be a significant predictor of progression in MGUS [91, 100, 102, 103], and clonal plasma cells can also be detected in the peripheral blood of SMM as well as MM [104-106]. Circulating abnormal plasma cells can be detected in up to 20% of MGUS patients [102, 103] and up to 80% MM [107, 108]. The increase in circulating plasma cells parallels their increase in bone marrow [101]. T-Cell Function Several studies have sought to evaluate defects in T-cell frequencies and function broadly in MGUS and myeloma. At present, there is limited evidence for both decreased antigen-specific T-cell responses and less so for T-dependent B-cell antigen-specific responses. Significant aberrations in T-cell count and function have been described in MGUS and MM. A decrease in CD4+/CD8+ ratio due to increased CD8+ T cells in the bone marrow and circulation has been reported in both conditions [95], or due to lower CD4+ T-cell numbers [102], whereas others have shown that the MGUS CD4+/CD8+ ratio and absolute numbers do not differ significantly from healthy controls [109]. Within the CD4+ T-cell compartment in MM, selective loss of the CD45R+ subset has been reported [110]. Th1/Th2 cytokine balance regulates the immune response. Th1/Th2 polarization depends on the local cytokine concentrations that induce differentiation of CHAPTER 236 na\u00efve T lymphocytes to either Th1 cells, which promote cell-mediated immunity, or Th2 cells, which promote antibody-mediated immunity [111, 112]. In many hematological malignancies, however, the balance is changed [113, 114]. In MGUS, the balance seems comparable to healthy individuals [115], whereas in MM, there is an imbalanced Th1/Th2 ratio that results in a defective Th1 response [115]. This defective Th1 response correlates with disease stage and is related to elevated levels of IL-6 and increased numbers of IL-6+CD3+ T cells. Local concentrations of IL-12 that induce differentiation of na\u00efve T lymphocytes to a Th1 phenotype, however, are compromised by IL-10 and fail to induce polarization of activated T lymphocytes in vivo in MM [115]. To examine T-cell response to infectious agent antigens, Maecker et al. characterized the in vitro CD8+ T-cell response in HLA-A*0201+ MM patients and healthy individuals to influenza A and Epstein-Barr virus-derived immunodominant epitopes using major Following in vitro stimulation, 67% healthy individuals showed an increased frequency of antigen-specific T cells for both antigens while in myeloma the magnitude of the response was reduced, with <30% reacting to both viral antigens [116]. These findings need to be expanded to examine antigen-specific T-cell capacity in vivo to vaccination to a wider spectrum of infection-related antigens. Chemotherapy aggravates the immunodeficient state of myeloma patients, resulting in significant reductions in CD4+ as well as specific reductions in CD4+ CD45RO+ cells as compared to untreated myeloma; this decrease is strongly associated with opportunistic infections [25]. The induction of effector T-cells in response to active vaccination (e.g., to counter infection) will be influenced by functional regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Treg cells play an important role in modulating immune response, maintaining immune homeostasis, and suppressing excessive immune responses where any imbalances lead to impaired immune functions. Several subsets of Tregs have been identified; naturally occurring CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs generated in the thymus, and peripherally inducible Tregs that include type IL-10 and Th3 CD4+ Tregs that produce TGF- E [ 1 1 7-1 1 9). Furthermore, CD8+ as well as double-negative Treg Treg) cells have can regulate the effector Th1 and Th2 responses by production of soluble cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor- E (TGF- E) and/or contact dependent mechanisms [122, 123]. There is significant discrepancy in the literature regarding the frequency of Treg cells and their function in MGUS and MM that is probably related to the differences in techniques and markers used to identify these cells. A report by Prabhala et al. showed that the frequency of CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs in MGUS and MM is reduced and they were functionally impaired as the Tregs had significantly reduced ability to suppress T-cell proliferation [124]. In contrast, Beyer et al. found a significantly IMMUNE DEFECTS IN THE R ISK OF INFECT ION AND RESPONSE TO VACC INATION... 237 increased frequency of CD4+CD25hiFoxP3+ Tregs in MGUS as well as treated and untreated myeloma. Using allogenic T cell stimulation, they showed that these cells also maintained their functionality as they inhibited proliferation and IFN- J production [125]. Other studies confirmed that CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells were increased and this increase correlated with disease activity in MM [126, 127]. A marked decrease in DN Tregs has also been reported in MM [126]. A reduced frequency or compromised Treg activity on the other hand may be deleterious to the host, as this results in dysfunctional T cell responses and increased risk of infections [128]. DC Function Dendritic cells (DCs) as professional antigen presenting cells play a central role in recruiting host adaptive immunity. Using blood dendritic cell antigen (BDCA) were found to be suppressed in MGUS and further reduced as the disease progressed in MM [94]. The reduced number of circulating mDCs and pDCs in MM are characterized by a lower expression of HLA-DR, CD40, and CD80, in addition to an impaired induction of T cell proliferation and cytokine stimulation [129, 130]. The functional defects result from IL-6 inhibiting the growth of CD34+ DC progenitors and switching development and maturation of CD34+ cells from DC toward monocytic cells with phagocytic activity but with no antigen-presentation Enumeration of high potency CMRF44+ CD14 CD19 DCs in MM in peripheral blood approached relatively normal numbers, expressing expected levels of CD80 and CD86. They did however exhibit functional defects with reduced capacity to up-regulate CD80 and CD86 expression after CD40L and IL-2 defect and and IL-10 antibodies. IL-12 and IFN- J can also neutralize the failure to stimulate CD80 upregulation [132]. As in other immune compartments, specific therapeutic agents can impact on DC function: bortezomib, a major drug in MM, significantly impairs the immunostimulatory capacity of mDCs [133, 134]. An additional consideration is that pDCs have been strikingly shown to interact with MM cells to induce tumor cell growth and survival [135]. Nonetheless, DCs remain a major target for immunotherapeutic intervention in MM [136]. While DC considerations in MGUS and MM have relevance to understanding many aspects of immune response to vaccination against infection, in relation to T-dependent B-cell responses in germinal canters, it is the follicular DC specialized subset that is important in generating B-cell memory, coupled with TFH cells [137]. As yet, disease impact on these secondary lymphoid organ immune cell interactions has not been investigated in MGUS or MM.CHAPTER 238 NK Cell Function Natural killer cells have a role in immune response to viral infection [138, 139], and interface with adaptive immunity. They also play an important role in initial immune response to tumor cells, but as yet there is no concrete evidence for a surveillance and anti-tumor role for NK cells in response to the premalignant clone in MGUS. Increased numbers of NK cells have been described in MGUS, in newly diagnosed MM and in low tumor burden MM [140-142]. NK cell function is intact in the setting of MGUS and newly diagnosed MM. However, NK cytotoxicity against MM decreases as disease progresses [140, 141, 143]. The downregulation of NK cell activating receptors NKG2D, NKp30, and CD244 in MGUS and MM in the bone marrow niche but not in the circulation suggests a possible mechanism of immune escape of the tumor clone [144]. MHC I molecules are critical determinants of NK cell activity. The expression levels of MHC class I polypeptide-related chain A (MICA), a soluble ligand of NKG2D is increased on plasma cells in MGUS and is strongly expressed in advancing disease in MM [145]. However, the soluble NKG2D ligand, MICA, shed by MM cells as disease progresses, as a result of the upregulation of ERp5 [146] down-regulates NKG2D on effector levels are diminished in MM with MICA shedding, which contributes to immune suppression [146, 147]. Normal to increased lytic activity of peripheral blood, NK cells have been described in MGUS but in MM with MICA shedding NK activity is decreased [146]. The immunomodulatory agents thalidomide and lenalidomide have been reported to enhance NK cell cytotoxicity against MM cells [148], highlighting an aspect of current therapy that appears to potentiate immune capacity in disease, and increased NK cells are also seen in the peripheral blood of patients that respond to therapy [149]. The Immunosuppressive Microenvironment of MM A number of factors induce the immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes tumor survival in MM and simultaneously induces immune dysfunction. Immunosuppressive factors include increased levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, and TGF- E [150]. They suppressing NK cell cytotoxicity, and IL-10 and IL-6 have been implicated in DC dysfunction, as discussed above [115, 129]. TGF- E also has a central role in inhibiting IL-2-induced T cell proliferation [151]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important cytokine in the MM microenvironment as it not only promotes the secretion of IL-6 but also the growth and migration of MM cells [152]. Specific tumor adaptations in MM cells mediate immunosuppression. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) overexpression by MM cells, which correlates with poor outcome, is also implicated in suppressing macrophage- mediated or T-cell-mediated tumor killing [153]. For effective therapy against infection, a combinational approach is required: tailored vaccination together with strategies to combat the immunosuppressive MM microenvironment.IMMUNE DEFECTS IN THE R ISK OF INFECT ION AND RESPONSE TO VACC INATION... 239 HUMORAL IMMU NE AN D HIB VACC INATION IN MM Vaccination Following Chemotherapy Patients with MM undergoing chemotherapy are at an increased risk of contracting influenza, but it remains uncertain as to whether these patients are able to mount sufficient immune response to benefit from vaccination. Previous studies have shown heterogeneous responses to influenza vaccination in myeloma (discussed below). A comparison of studies of immune response to influenza vaccination is limited by differences in read-outs used to interpret response to vaccination. Most studies measure antibody levels by the hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) test, and responses are defined as 2.5-fold rise HI after vaccination. Seroconversion is defined as a 4-fold rise in titer and seroprotection as a titer of at least 1:40 [154, 155]. Vaccination against influenza in MM is still a matter of clinical uncertainty, in part as knowledge about the protective efficacy against clinical disease (influenza) itself is limited, especially in aging. Controlled studies in MM evaluating influenza vaccination with clinical endpoints (contracting influenza and severity of infection) are lacking. Despite this clinical uncertainty, influenza vaccination is recommended in MM patients. In a study of MM patients the results of influenza vaccination were disappointing as only 10% achieved protection against two viral strains and 19% developed protective antibody titers to all three strains in the vaccine [156]. Comparable observations were noted in another study of 70 patients with hematological malignancies of which 16 were MM cases, and of the 70 only 4 responded, but none were MM, to achieve seroprotection to all 3 viral strains [157]. Moreover, two doses of influenza vaccine failed to improve antibody response to influenza vaccination in patients with hematological malignancy undergoing therapy or with recently discontinued therapy as the response rate did not increase following a second booster dose of the vaccine [158, 159]. Overall, the booster influenza vaccination strategy failed to increase the antibody response in immunocompromised patients. Notwithstanding these observations, patients with hematological malignancies, even under treatment, can mount protective immune responses against influenza vaccination. Indeed, in a study of 34 patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders and MM, some receiving therapy, response rates were comparable to healthy controls [160]. More than 60% achieved seroprotective responses to all three viral strains, and of the six patients with MM, three developed seroprotection to all three viral strains. However, these studies were limited by the low number of subjects and by patients on diverse therapy with varying dosage intensity. This precluded detection of a relation between response to vaccination and disease state and stage and also the relation between vaccination response and treatment.CHAPTER 240 Initial studies in the early 80s that utilized the 14-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine showed that MM patients responded poorly to immunization. The antibody concentrations to 12 of the 14 polysaccharides in the vaccine were simultaneously measured by radioimmunoassay. Radiolabeled polysaccharides were incubated with sera and the resulting antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated and quantified with a scintillation counter as nanograms of antibody protein nitrogen/milliliter [161]. The interpretation of an adequate response to the 14-valent pneumococcal vaccine was variable since the antibody concentrations needed for protection were difficult to define [162]. Low levels of antibody were reported to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides before and after vaccination in MM patients, significantly lower than those in healthy controls [163-165]. Lazarus et al. showed that in MM patients before vaccination, the grand geometric mean antibody concentrations for all serotypes combined was 91 ng/mL, which is less than their presumed protective level of 215 ng antibody nitrogen/mL [165]. Following vaccination, the grand geometric mean antibody concentration remained significantly lower in MM than in healthy controls (91 versus 820 ng antibody nitrogen/mL). Thirty percent of the patients had an antibody response that might be protective for half of the vaccine serotypes. Geometric mean titers >215 ng antibody nitrogen/mL serotypes 3, Similarly, et al. observed titers >200 ng antibody nitrogen/ mL only for 18C, and 23F in myeloma patients [163]. A study of 42 MM patients reported immunization responses that were inferior to those of HCs and the low anti-pneumococcal titers correlated with risk of serious infection [166]. MM patients with IgG M-protein were shown to have lower antibody titers compared to those with IgA or Bence Jones MM. In line with these observations, Schmid et al. also showed that patients with IgA MM consistently responded with higher antibody titers than IgG MM and had higher increases in levels of antibodies after pneumococcal vaccination [163]. These studies indicate that generation of antibodies to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccination is impaired. This may be because pneumococcal polysaccharides are particularly weakly immunogenic in the immune suppressed state of these patients. Polysaccharide vaccines are more immunogenic when conjugated to a carrier protein (discussed above). However, MM patients elicit sub-protective to protective antibody responses to Hib polysaccharide conjugate vaccination: Nix and colleagues reported that 45% of MM had protective in comparison to 97% HC while 75% of MM patients had protective titers in a study by Robertson and colleagues [156, 167]. A more recent study utilizing the currently used 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine reported that the response to pneumococcal vaccination was again disappointing, with 56% having a fourfold rise in titer and 39% achieving protective antibody titers 4-6 weeks after vaccination [156]. These responses to adjuvant in conjugated vaccine flag up deficiencies in pre-requisite Th responses in MM.IMMUNE DEFECTS IN THE R ISK OF INFECT ION AND RESPONSE TO VACC INATION... 241 Transplantation Ablative chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation generally results in an acute immunosuppression in both arms of innate and adaptive immune system that lasts for several months, resulting in a protracted functional recovery. B-cell reconstitution after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is slow, with B cells reaching normal levels 4-8 months post-transplant [168, 169]. Re-population of T cells is also prolonged (170], appearing as abnormal subpopulations that show an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio [171, 172]. The prolonged and severe immune suppression following autologous and allogenic stem cell transplantation not only compromises immunity and pose a risk for infection but also results in poor responses to vaccination [173-175]. Impaired antibody responses to influenza have been demonstrated in this setting [159, 176], however, a longer transplant to vaccination interval is associated with better serological responses. Similarly, poor responses to pneumococcal vaccination prior to transplant [177] as well as vaccination after transplant have been reported [173, 178, 179]. In a randomized Phase 1/2 study in advanced MM undergoing high-dose mephalan and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), post-transplant conjugate pneumococcal vaccination resulted in no or low antibody responses and did not increase after booster vaccination [180]. However, vaccination before transplant together with the adoptive transfer of T-cells early after transplant followed by booster vaccination resulted in robust and sustained antibody response as well as accelerated T-cell recovery [180]. This achieved protective titers against four serotypes (6B, 14, 19F, and 23F) in 60% of cohort as compared to 18% when there was no vaccination. In another study of MM, autologous T cell transfer resulted in poor or no influenza vaccine responses unless the patient had received influenza vaccination prior to autologous T-cell collection [181]. Clearly, the priming of the autologous T cells by pre-transplant vaccination most likely enhances antigen-specific antibody induction following transfer. These studies demonstrate that a T-cell adoptive transfer can accelerates the numerical and functional recovery of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells that may provide help in restoring humoral immunity in MM. Strategies to enhance lymphocyte recovery and function (both B- and T-cell) in a transplant-associated therapeutic intervention could further improve outcome in achieving protective serological and cellular immunity to infectious agents in MM. A detailed summary of the many strategies that have been assessed to date in vaccination against infection in MM is compiled in Table 1. Conclusion and Future Directions Immunosenescence in aging compounds immune function in MGUS and MM, which incrementally deteriorates as disease progresses to symptomatic phase.

Increased risk of invasive disease is a rationale for immunizationCLPD, Chronic lymphoproliferative disorders; HC, Lymphoma; VAD, vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone settings, it is evident that a complex array of factors underlies a diminution of immune capacity. This is manifest as both numerical imbalances in B-cell and T-cell populations, and in impaired lymphocyte functionality; the immunological synapse and cross-talk between these two key immune players is not fully defined yet in MGUS or MM, and remains a key area for further investigation. Clonal expansions in MGUS and MM directly compete with niche space for long-term memory of infection, affecting polyclonal normal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Direct immunosuppression by tumor cells, including via cytokine imbalance and other mechanisms such as aberrant ligand expression to block NK cell activity, further affect the capacity of the immune system to mount effective challenge to infection, or to vaccination aimed at enhancing immunity to both viral and bacterial agents. Because of the morbidity and mortality that follow infection in MM, clinical therapy still aims at vaccinating against specific bacterial threats. Mounting effective immunity to capsular polysaccharide infection-related antigens for instance, has as yet not been optimized although linking antigen to T-cell recruiting adjuvant is a notable advance. The complications generated directly by therapeutic drugs that weaken the immune response must be understood further, to select the best strategy to restore anti-infection immunity in MM. Conversely, use of immunomodulatory drugs in MM will need further investigation in how to best harness their pro-immune function during vaccination against infection. Exploiting transplantation in therapy by prior vaccination to educate T-cells to enhance humoral response to vaccination is indicative of the types of strategy that can be utilized to counter infection. It is also highly likely that current advances in understanding how aging in the normal healthy population affects immune responses will be exploited in developing the best strategies to institute immunity against infection in MGUS and MM.IMMUNE DEFECTS IN THE R ISK OF INFECT ION AND RESPONSE TO VACC INATION... 245Table 1.

The immune response to influenza vaccination has not been examined in MGUS, a benign plasma cell monoclonal expansion in the bone marrow that secretes elevated levels of monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-protein). Pre- existing antibody titers to infectious agents can be depressed, but the degree of immunosuppression in response to active vaccination remains unclear. Furthermore, the association of M-protein levels with impaired antigen specific response has not been examined to date in MGUS. Methods We investigated antibody as well as T cell responses in 19 MGUS patients and age-matched healthy controls following influenza vaccination. H1N1 and H3N2 influenza-specific IgG antibodies were measured by ELISA. The frequencies of H1N1 and H3N2 specific IFN- J secreting cells were measured by ELISpot. Results Polyclonal isotype-switched immunoglobulin levels were significantly reduced in the MGUS cohort (p<0.05). At the cohort level, HIN1 and IgG titers were comparable in MGUS and HCs. However, a key distinction emerged in relation to M-protein levels. MGUS patients with high M-protein had decreased influenza specific IgG titers which they failed to expand post-vaccination. Low M-protein MGUS H1N1-specific IFN- J responses were high and comparable with HCs but showed no discernible increase post-vaccination, while cellular responses to H1N1 in high M-protein MGUS were markedly reduced. Conclusions Overall, MGUS showed depressed immune responses to influenza vaccination that varied strikingly with M-protein levels.IgG AND TH1 RESPONSES Gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a pre-malignant condition that mainly affects the elderly. It is characterized by the clonal proliferation of plasma cells resulting in the observed monoclonal protein (M-protein). It is diagnosed by presence of M-protein in the serum at levels <30g/L, bone marrow plasma cell infiltration of <10% and no clinical manifestations of organ damage or the presence of a B cell malignancy. MGUS is associated with a lifelong risk of progression to multiple myeloma or other related malignancy at a rate of 1% per year [1].Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell proliferative disorder which features a reduction in polyclonal immunoglobulin levels and more profound B cell dysfunction than MGUS. Infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and their spectrum has been reported to change subsequently relative to disease activity and immunosuppressive treatment that leaves the patients immunocompromised [2]. Recent studies have shown that myeloma is almost always preceded by MGUS therefore establishing a key role for MGUS in the pathway to myeloma [3, 4]. The increased susceptibility of myeloma patients to infections has been assessed extensively [5-7], however the risk of infections in MGUS has been less well studied. An increased risk of bacterial as well as viral infections has been described in a small number of studies [8-10]. MGUS also has variable consequences on the immune system. Polyclonal immunoglobulin levels are normal or reduced in MGUS but the degree of immunosuppression, if present at all, is unknown and therefore it is unclear whether patients with MGUS have compromised humoral or cellular immunity. Whether the low polyclonal immunoglobulin levels and or high monoclonal protein concentration are associated with impaired antigen specific response has not yet been established in MGUS. Both B and T cells are important in the immune response. Little is known of the B cell function in MGUS, yet B cell function dysregulation in myeloma is more profound and has a consequence on the immune response as the humoral response to vaccination is hampered. Disturbances in the T cell compartment may also result in impaired immune response, however these have been studied in less detail in MGUS. Absolute numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were shown to be comparable to healthy controls in MGUS [11]. Significantly increased frequencies of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T reg cells in MGUS as well as treated and untreated myeloma have been reported. These cells were shown to maintain their functionality as they inhibited proliferation and IFN- J production [12, 13]. Influenza has a high incidence and vaccination reduces the morbidity and mortality caused by influenza virus infection. Influenza vaccination is recommended for individuals in high-risk groups including the elderly and immunocompromised [14]. As MGUS is more prevalent with increasing age, a substantial number of the patients fall under the high-risk group of elderly CHAPTER 360 individuals, so they receive seasonal influenza vaccination. Whether this vaccination is effective is unknown. Therefore, we devised a prospective study to investigate the impact of monoclonal protein on the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in MGUS patients following vaccination with a trivalent subunit influenza vaccine in order to analyze whether MGUS monoclonal protein burden is associated with functional deficits of the immune system. MGUS patients show suboptimal response to vaccination with M-protein concentration impacting their response. MET HODS Patients and controls Patients that were known with MGUS at the University Medical Centre Groningen hematology department were included in the study when they fulfilled the standard diagnostic criteria for MGUS: serum M protein levels <30g/L, clonal plasma cells in bone marrow <10% and no myeloma related dysfunction or other B-cell proliferative diseases [15]. Patients were excluded if they had current infection, defined as fever in combination with clinical focal signs of infection and the need for therapeutic antibiotic treatment, influenza vaccination within the 6 months prior to the study, pregnancy or malignancy. The duration of MGUS varied between patients from 1 till 19 years since diagnosis. Persistent monoclonal proteins were detected in all MGUS patients. For control purposes, sex and age matched healthy individuals who had no co-morbidities or malignancy, condition associated with immune dysfunction or use of immune modulating drugs were included parallel to the MGUS patients. The healthy controls were recruited from the populations visiting general physician practice for yearly vaccination. Healthy controls with monoclonal protein in their serum were excluded. All participants included gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The institutional medical ethics committee of University Medical Centre Groningen approved the study. All MGUS patients and controls were vaccinated between October 2010 and January 2011. They received an intramuscular injection of the influenza vaccine (Influvac\u00d2, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Netherlands). The vaccine, a subunit preparation A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008. Information on influenza vaccination in the previous years was obtained. Local and systemic adverse reactions for up to 7 days post vaccination were recorded by participants using a standard questionnaire which included the reporting of pain, itching, induration at site of injection, fever, myalgia and flu-like symptoms. No serious adverse reactions were observed.IgG AND TH1 RESPONSES CORRELA TE WITH M-PRO TEIN BURDEN 361 Evaluations At study entry, baseline standard laboratory parameters were measured; complete blood counts including leukocyte differentiation, lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, IgG immunoglobulin levels. Normal ranges of serum immunoglobulins g/L a monoclonal immunoglobulin was determined by immunofixation. Further venous blood samples were obtained at the day of vaccination (day 0), 7 days and 28 days post-vaccination. Serum was separated by centrifugation and stored at -20\u00b0C until further analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation of CPT vacutainer tubes (BD) drawn venous blood 10% dimethylsulfoxide(Merck, Germany). PBMCs were stored in liquid nitrogen until further use. Measurement of anti-influenza IgG antibodies by ELISA The levels of anti-influenza specific IgG antibodies to A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 were determined by an in-house ELISA. In short, ELISA plates (Coaster) were coated with 1 \u00b5g/ml subunit of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 and subsequently incubated with serum samples collected at day 0, day 7 and day 28 following vaccination. The detection of influenza-specific antibodies was done with mouse anti-human IgG-HRP (Southern Biotech, USA), followed by incubation with TMB substrate (Sigma). Absorbance at 450nm was read with an Emax microplate reader and antibody concentrations calculated by SOFTmax PRO software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA). For a standard curve, a dilution series of human IgG standard, N protein (Siemens) was used on every plate and the antibody contents of the samples were read from the linear part of the sigmoid curve. IFN- J ELISpot Pre and post vaccination PBMC samples from MGUS patients and matched healthy controls were simultaneously thawed and further analysed. Viability was evaluated by trypan blue staining and then the thawed PBMCs were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C before proceeding with the ELISpot assay. Before plating, the cells were counted using an automated cell counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). 96 well filtration plates (MAISPWU10, Millipore, Ireland) were coated overnight at anti-human IFN- J (Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden). Plates were subsequently washed and blocked for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C with culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% serum and 50 \u00b5g/mL gentamycin). 200, 000 PBMCs were added per well in duplicates and in combination CHAPTER 362 with different stimuli to make up a volume of 200\u00b5L/well and incubated at (H3N2) at a final concentration of 2 \u00b5g/mL was used to stimulate the PBMCs. Concanavalin A at 2.5 \u00b5g/mL was used as a positive control while PBMCs in culture medium alone were used as a negative control. Following 48 hour incubation and washing the plates once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), secreted cytokine was \u00b5g/mL biotinylated anti-human IFN-J (Mabtech). After incubating the plates at room temperature for 3 hours, the plates were washed again and 100\u00b5L/well of 1:1 000 diluted streptavidin- alkaline phosphatase (Mabtech) was added and incubated for 1.5 hours at room temperature. Plates were then subsequently washed and developed with 100 \u00b5L/ well BCIP/NBT plus substrate (Mabtech) for 15 minutes before washing the plate under tape water and analysing on an ELISpot reader (automated-video-analysis system, Sanquin, Amsterdam, Netherlands) Statistical analysis Data were analysed with Graphpad Prism 4 (Graphpad software Inc.). Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test and Fisher's exact test for categorical data were used as appropriate. For correlations, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS A total of 19 MGUS patients gave informed consent and were included; their median age (range) was 66 (49-81) and 63% were male. They also had a similar vaccination history to healthy controls, with the majority of the participants having been vaccinated in the preceding influenza season. Ninety percent of the patients were vaccinated against influenza the previous year compared to 79% of healthy controls. The study demographics are shown in Table 1. The concentration of M-protein varied from unquantifiable levels to 24.8g/L. M-protein was detected by immunofixation but was unquantifiable in 8 patients by serum protein electrophoresis because the concentration of the M-protein was small or the M-protein migrated in the E fraction. It has been recently shown that MGUS patients with unquantifiable M-protein are qualitatively similar to MGUS with quantifiable M-protein as they have persistent M-protein and also progress to plasma cell malignancies at a similar rate [16]. Significantly reduced relative numbers of CD19+ B cells were observed in the MGUS cohort compared to the healthy controls (p=0.05). Significantly reduced serum levels of non-involved polyclonal IgA (p=0.027) but not IgM (p=0.08) immunoglobulin were also observed for the MGUS cohort compared to the healthy controls. A proportion of MGUS patients (8/19; 42%) exhibited CORRELA TE WITH M-PRO TEIN Monoclonal protein load correlates with influenza-specific H1N1 IgG responses To determine vaccine-specific antibodies, we assayed serum concentration of IgG antibodies to H1N1 and H3N2 using ELISA. Before vaccination, influenza- specific IgG titers to H1N1 and H3N2 strains were comparable and did not differ significantly in both the healthy controls and MGUS. A significant response to both the H1N1 and H3N2 strain was observed both in healthy controls and MGUS at day 7 and this response was also sustained at day 28 (Figure 1). We examined whether the magnitude of the influenza specific IgG antibody response after vaccination was associated with the monoclonal protein size. A negative relationship was found between the level of M-protein and influenza-specific IgG titers whereby high levels of M-protein associated with depressed influenza H1N1 specific IgG titers post-vaccination. An inverse correlation between M-protein levels and H1N1-Table 1.

To further assess how high M-protein concentration affects the kinetics of the influenza specific response, subjects were further stratified into two groups according to their concentration of M-protein; low M-protein and high M-protein. We used a cut-off concentration for low M-protein MGUS of <15g/L, as monoclonal protein concentrations of 15g/L have been described as a risk factor for progression to myeloma [15, 17]. The levels of prevaccination influenza specific IgG titers were significantly lower in the high M-protein group and the antibody levels post-vaccination remained depressed in high M-protein MGUS. As a group, the low M-protein MGUS patients showed significantly increased influenza specific IgG levels to H1N1 at day 7 (p=0.002) and day 28 (p=0.002) but high M-protein MGUS did not show a significant difference in titers pre and post-vaccination (Figure 1B). Similar responses were observed for H3N2 where low serum M-protein was associated with significantly increased H3N2 specific IgG response at day 7 (p=0.0007) and day 28 (p=0.0002). On the other hand, in patients with high M-protein levels no discernible increase in H3N2 specific IgG levels at both day 7 and day 28 occurred. (Figure 2B). Next, we assessed whether having an IgG MGUS was associated with lower responses compared to other isotypes. Patients were further stratified according to whether they had IgG M-protein or non-IgG (IgA and IgM). Patients with an IgG MGUS had similar levels of H1N1 specific IgG compared to those with other MGUS isotypes. However, for the H3N2 strain, IgG MGUS patients had significantly lower titers prevaccination (p=0.0435). Even though they had a significant rise in titers at day 28 their response was lower than that in non-IgG MGUS individuals (p=0.04) (data not shown). Figure 1.

Their frequencies did not differ between the healthy controls and MGUS patients for both the H1N1 and H3N2 influenza strains. A significant rise in H1N1-specific IFN- J secreting cells was observed at day 28 in the healthy control group (Figure 3A). A significantly higher fold increase in IFN- J secreting cells was shown for healthy controls compared to the MGUS group who failed to expand the numbers of H1N1-specific IFN- J secreting cells (p=0.035) (Figure 3B). Comparison of H3N2-specific IFN- J secreting cells did not reveal any significant expansions in numbers after vaccination within and between the healthy control and MGUS groups (data not shown). In order to assess whether monoclonal protein concentration has an influence on influenza specific cell mediated responses, we computed correlations between the concentration of M-protein and the number of influenza specific IFN- J secreting cells. High levels of M-protein were associated with lower IFN- J responses than that those in the MGUS cohort with low M-protein. The number of H1N1-specific IFN- J secreting cells at day 28 was inversely correlated with monoclonal protein levels (p=0.0182) with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.5812 (Figure 4A). No correlations were observed for the H3N2 strain. In an analysis stratified by M-protein concentration, levels 15 g/L were associated with significantly lower Figure2. High monoclonal protein concentration is associated with lower influenza- specific IgG response.

The number of IFN- J secreting cells in high M-protein MGUS was significantly lower at day 0 (p=0.0235) and at day 28 (p=0.0092) compared to the MGUS cohort with low M-protein (< 15g/L) even though low M-protein levels were not associated with a significant increase in IFN- J secreting cells (Figure 4B) DISCUSSI ON This study shows that high M-protein levels in MGUS are associated with impaired humoral and cell-mediated response to vaccination. The immune response to influenza vaccination is influenced by factors such as age, host immune defects as well as the type of vaccine administered [18-20]. The presence of M-protein in the serum of MGUS patients is a consequence of the monoclonal expansion of plasma cells and this could possibly affect humoral and/or cellular immune response. Hypogammaglobulinaemia which is often associated with myeloma, [21] is also associated with decreased immune responses. However hypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported at a lower frequency in MGUS [22-24]. The depressed humoral response seen in MGUS is partly reflected by a diminished production of polyclonal immunoglobulins as displayed by a large fraction of the patients. Our data demonstrated a decrease in polyclonal immunoglobulin levels in MGUS and hypogammaglobulinaemia in 42% of the patients. Whether such factors, together with the detected monoclonal protein load, lead to a decrease in specific antibody production has not been investigated Figure 3.

Also of importance is the fact that MGUS predominantly affects the elderly in whom further age-associated changes and decline in functioning of the immune system have been described. These changes include a decrease in na\u00efve B cell generation, decrease in class switch recombination resulting in decreased IgG production, altered balance of CD4+ T cell memory cells and decreased T cell proliferative responses [25-28]. These age-associated changes result in the consequentially observed increased risk of infection and reduced response to vaccination [29, 30]. This should not bias our results as we specifically included age-matched controls. IFN-J production described in our study following vaccination is presumably a result of CD4+ T-cells and limited CD8+ T-cell help. Vaccination with subunit trivalent inactivated vaccine leads to Th-cell help for antibody production but no CTL responses [31]. The data from our study indicates that pre-existing influenza specific IFN- J secreting cells can be detected before vaccination in healthy individuals as well as in MGUS. This could be because of previous encounter with the virus and also previous vaccinations. Vaccination elicited a substantial T cell response in healthy controls as a significant increase in IFN- J secreting cells was demonstrated whereas MGUS patients failed to expand the response. This suggests that the protective role exerted by IFN- J during secondary response to influenza virus could be affected in MGUS, and this has consequences on induction of antibody responses as well as delayed resolution of the immune Figure 4. The influence of M-protein on H1 N1-specific I FN-J response in MGUS. (A) Monoclonal protein size is shown to correlate with the frequency of H1N1-specific IFN- J secreting cells at day 28 post-vaccination in MGUS patients (n=16).

It remains to be investigated whether the observed poor response could also be partially due to quantitative and functional defects in T-cells. Defects in the T-cell compartment, if present, may also contribute to the less favourable vaccination responses, as T cell dependent B cell responses were poor. Following influenza vaccination, secretion of influenza-specific antibodies leads to a rise in serum antigen-specific antibodies. [32, 33] IgG antibodies are the predominant antibody class induced after vaccination and increase till they reach a peak 4 weeks post vaccination [34] [32, 35, 36]. Our results show that the amount and, to a lesser extent, the type of M protein have a significant influence in the development of influenza specific IgG antibodies after vaccination. High M-protein MGUS patients had lower pre-vaccination influenza-specific IgG titers, which they failed to increase post-vaccination. Furthermore, increasing M-protein concentration was associated with decreased H1N1-specific IgG response in MGUS. Therefore, poor post-vaccination influenza specific IgG antibody levels observed in MGUS patients with high M-protein may predict response to influenza vaccination. This suggests that these patients are likely to be less protected by vaccination. Patients with IgG MGUS showed significantly lower H3N2-specific IgG titers both pre and post vaccination compared to healthy controls. IgG M-protein is associated with decreased polyclonal IgG production possibly due to suppression of normal B cell differentiation. This then leads to attrition of the plasma cell compartment therefore limiting the number of plasma cells specific for some antigens. In vaccination studies with myeloma patients, IgG myeloma patients had lower serological responses compared to those with IgA paraprotein or Bence Jones [37]. In line with these observations, another study showed that patients with IgA myeloma consistently responded with higher antibody titres and had higher increases in levels of antibodies after pneumococcal vaccination compared to IgG and IgM myeloma.[38]. A large population-based study in MGUS by Kristinsson et al describing an increased risk of bacterial and viral infections that included influenza also showed that higher M-protein concentrations at diagnosis were associated with higher risks of infection [8]. Our results indicate that M-protein load has a great influence on the response to vaccination. The reduced response observed in MGUS may be a consequence B cell dysregulation that results in the M-protein with high M protein being a probable marker of more profound underlying B cell dysfunction. The high M-protein levels together with the consistently observed accompanying hypogammaglobulinaemia are important factors that influence the immune responses to influenza vaccination. We postulate that the clonal expansion of plasma cells lead to decreased B cell repertoire diversity. This alteration in repertoire consequently limits the number of cells available to respond to antigenic challenge and therefore may contribute to decreased humoral response. However no repertoire analysis has been carried out in MGUS, IgG AND TH1 RESPONSES CORRELA TE WITH M-PRO TEIN BURDEN 369 but data in the elderly suggests that B cell diversity decreases with age and the immunoglobulin repertoire diversity correlated with antibody response and health status [39, 40]. Although there were similar absolute numbers of circulating CD19+ B cells in healthy controls and MGUS patients, a decrease in the relative number of B cells was observed in MGUS and this might have contributed to the hampered responses. Other B cell subsets important in immune response and aging that include na\u00efve and memory B cells have not been studied [41-44]. There is evidence suggesting that B cells not only function as antibody producers but also as antigen presenting cells and are required for primary T-cell expansion and differentiation [45]. This change in MGUS B cell frequencies observed in our study could also result in insufficient help for T-cells therefore being consequential of the impaired T-cell responses. Our study had some limitations in that the sample size was small and the numbers of subjects in subgroups were low when stratified for M-protein concentration as well as the type of M-protein. On the other hand, showing such significant results in the relative low number of patients studied suggest a strong effect for the high M-protein group. Larger studies are required to confirm our findings. Our MGUS cohort is a heterogeneous group, ranging from individuals with steady and low M-protein levels to those with increasing and high M-protein levels inclined towards transformation to myeloma and other B cell proliferative disorders therefore their degree of immunosuppression is likely to vary. In summary, MGUS patients displayed subnormal polyclonal immunoglobulin levels. The presence of this hypogammaglobulinaemia together with M-protein load has an influence on the humoral and cellular mediated immune response to vaccination. Moreover, our results suggest that the level of M-protein may be a predictor of poor vaccination response. REFE RENCE S 1.

The degree of this immune deficiency increases with progression of disease. As a result, patients with monoclonal gammopathies are prone to infections that include influenza virus. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) patients with high monoclonal protein elicit poor IgG responses to influenza vaccination. Methods We therefore investigated whether the poor influenza-specific IgG response observed in MGUS translated to poor seroprotection rates in this cohort. Furthermore, we analysed the memory B cell subsets in MGUS as well as quantifying the influenza-specific memory B cells after administration of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. Peripheral memory B cell subsets were measured by flow cytometry and stimulated total and influenza-specific memory B cells were detected using an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay at day 0 as well as at day7- and day 28 post-vaccination. Results MGUS show low seroprotection rates (37%) with the response correlating the lower H1N1-specific IgG titers. The frequency of IgG+ cells in the IgD-CD27+ fraction at day 0 correlated with the fold increase in HI titers as well as the H1N1-specific IgG titers at day 28 post-vaccination in HC suggesting a recall memory response. In contrast, the frequency of the IgG+ cells in the IgD-CD27+ fraction is decreased at baseline in MGUS. Furthermore, the frequency of influenza-specific IgG memory B cells is significantly lower post-vaccination in MGUS in comparison to HC, as measured by ELISpot. Despite the poor IgG response, MGUS elicit significant IgM and IgA antibody responses to influenza vaccination. However, the protective capacity of these two antibodies is questionable in MGUS. Conclusion MGUS is associated with poor IgG memory response that is likely to impair the long maintenance of serologic response. HAMPERED INFLUENZA-SPECIFIC IgG B CELL RESPONSES 477 INTRODUCTION As a precursor condition to multiple myeloma (MM), MGUS does not present with clinical features of MM or other lymphoproliferative malignancies [1]. However, it is characterized by monoclonal immunoglobulin <30g/L, normal to decreased levels of IgG as well as by B lymphocyte percentages ranging from low to normal [2-4]. Additionally, there is increased susceptibility to infections in MGUS [5]. Furthermore, immune responses to influenza vaccination vary with M-protein levels as MGUS with high M-protein (>15g/L) has lower IgG they fail to expand post-vaccination [6]. Influenza vaccination-induced immunity is primarily antibody based, relying on the activation of na\u00efve B cells as well as the recall of memory B cells (MBCs) to rapidly respond upon re-encounter with antigen. Clonally expanded B cells can differentiate into MBCs or plasma cells that secrete antibodies at an increased rate as well as with higher affinity for antigen [7]. Several subsets of MBCs have been identified based of the expression of IgD and CD27: IgD-CD27+ classical memory switched (IgG+ or IgA+) cells, CD27+ unswitched memory cells that predominantly express IgD and IgM, but also IgM-only cells. Furthermore, IgD-CD27- (double negative (DN)) memory B cells have been described. Although a definite origin of the different memory B cell subsets remains to be established , it is proposed that isotype switched cells originate from germinal center (GC) reactions while IgM memory may be early emigrants from the GC which began participating in the GC reaction but exited before isotype switching [8]. Alternatively, IgM memory may develop through GC-independent pathways [9]. On the other hand, CD27+IgD+IgM+ cells may represent a recirculating fraction of marginal zone B cells [10][9]. Mutated, isotype switched DN B cells contain fewer somatic hypermutations in their immunoglobulin genes and have increased IgG3 use, further distinguishing them from their CD27+ counterparts [11]. Characteristics of the B cell response, and predominantly the nature of long-term B cell memory, are key determining factors of the protective capacity of many vaccines. These MBCs are of importance when the protective efficacy of a vaccine is largely determined by its ability to elicit a humoral response as in influenza vaccination. Indeed, parenteral vaccination with the seasonal trivalent inactivated vaccine induces systemic immune response on which protection is based. The influenza-specific circulating antibodies induced by vaccination decline within 6 months while longer-lasting MBCs pool remains to respond upon antigen re-encounter, in so doing heightening resistance to infection [12][13]. There is limited data concerning the B cell response to influenza vaccination in MGUS. We evaluated the peak effector responses by measuring antigen- specific titers by both ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition test. Furthermore, we investigated whether the inferior response to influenza vaccination in high monoclonal protein MGUS was associated with alteration in total as well as antigen- specific MBC responses to influenza. CHAPTER 478 MET HODS Study population Patients were included in the study when they fulfilled the standard diagnostic criteria for MGUS[14]. For control purposes, sex and age matched healthy individuals were included parallel to the MGUS patients. Healthy controls with monoclonal protein in their serum were excluded. The patient characteristics have been previously described [6]. All participants included gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The institutional medical ethics committee of University Medical Centre Groningen approved the study. All MGUS patients and controls received an intramuscular injection of the influenza vaccine (Influvac, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Netherlands) between October 2010 and January 2011. The vaccine, a subunit preparation of licensed 2010-2011 and serum isolation Venous blood samples were obtained at the day of vaccination (day 0), 7 days and 28 days post-vaccination. PBMCs were isolated using CPT vacutainer tubes according to manufacturer's instructions. The PBMCs were frozen in RPMI 1640 (Roswell Memorial Institute Lonza, UK) and 10% dimethylsulfoxide (Merck, Germany) and then stored in liquid nitrogen until further analysis. Serum was separated by centrifugation and stored at -20\u00b0C until further analysis Influenza-specific IgA and IgM antibodies by ELISA The level of anti-influenza specific serum IgA and IgM antibodies against A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 were determined by an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA plates (Costar) were coated with 1 \u00b5g/mL of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2. The plates were incubated overnight on a shaker. Subsequently, serum samples collected at day 0, day 7 and day 28 following vaccination were added to the plates and then serially diluted (1:4) in PBS /0.05% Tween-20 Biotech) or 1\u00b5g/ml mouse anti-human IgM-HRP (Southern Biotech) conjugate antibodies were used followed by incubation with 3,3',5,5'- tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate. The substrate reaction was stopped by adding H2SO4 (UMCG pharmacy). Absorbance at 450nm was read with an Emax microplate reader and antibody concentrations calculated by SOFTmax PRO software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA). For a standard curve, a dilution series of human IgG standard, N protein (Siemens) was used on every plate and the antibody contents of the samples were read from the linear part of the sigmoid curve.HAMPERED INFLUENZA-SPECIFIC Inhibition (HI) test to A/California7/2009/H1N1 was performed according to standard techniques as previously described [15]. The HI assay was performed using guinea pig erythrocytes and egg-grown influenza viruses as antigens. Memory B cell assay PBMCs were plated in 24-well plates at a cell concentration of 0.5x106 and 3.2\u00b5g/ml CpG-ODN- 2006 (InvivoGen). For PBMCs were (RPMI 1640, supplemented with 50 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin and 10% FCS) alone. Cells were subsequently incubated for 6 days at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. The samples were run in duplicates for detection of cells secreting total IgG antibodies as well as cells secreting filtration plates (Millipore, USA) were pre-wetted with 70% ethanol for 2 min and washed 3 times with 150 \u00b5L/well PBS (phosphate buffered saline; UMCG pharmacy). For coating, TIV (Influvac, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, The Netherlands) was diluted to 1\u00b5g/ml in PBS. To detect total Ig secreting cells, wells were coated with 2.5g/ml goat anti-human IgG (Bethyl Laboratories, USA). Wells with PBS only were used as uncoated controls. The plates were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing the plates 3 times with 150 \u00b5L/well 0,01% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), plates were blocked with 2% BSA and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours. The cultured PBMC were washed thoroughly before counting. The cells were subsequently resuspended in RPMI 1640 (+ 50 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin)/10% FCS and added to the plates in duplicates with 200l cell suspension/well. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18 hours. After the incubation, cells were discarded and the plates were washed with PBS /0,01% Tween-20 (6 \u00d7 150l/well). Subsequently, 100 \u00b5L/well Laboratories, USA) was added and plates incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Unbound conjugate antibody was then washed away with PBS (3x 150\u00b5l/ well) and then developed using TMB substrate (Sanquin, NL) in the dark, at room temperature. To stop the reaction, the plates were washed extensively under the tap and dried in a light-shielded place. Finally, the number of spots per well were quantified with an ELISpot plate reader (A.EL.VIS, Germany). Immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometric analysis of B cell subsets PBMCs were counted by the Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, USA) and a cell suspension of 2x106cells/mL was made. The following monoclonal antibodies were used Santa Biotechnology, IgD (V450) and IgM (APC) were from BD Biosciences. Cells were incubated with directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies for 60 minutes at 4\u00b0C. CHAPTER 480 After staining, cells were washed with 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Nine color flow cytometric analysis was carried out on the BD LSR II (BD Biosciences, USA) with BD FACSDiva Software. Cells were gated on SSC versus FSC to collect lymphocytes and then on CD19 cells versus SSC to gate B cells. Between 0.5 x105 and 1x 106 cells were collected. Further analysis for B cell subsets was done by Kaluza (Beckman Coulter, USA). We measured the frequency of CD19+: IgM memory (IgD+/ IgM+/ CD27+), switched memory B (IgD-/ CD27+/CD38 was done by Graphpad Prism 5 (Graphpad software). Data are presented as median (range) if not otherwise stated. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare groups. The Spearman rank test was used to test correlations between variables. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. RESULTS Reduced Hemagglutination Inhibition response in MGUS We analysed the serum Hemagglutination Inhibition titers before and 28 days after vaccination to evaluate whether the antibody production to one of the seasonal vaccine strains mirrors the responses observed by ELISA analysis. H1N1-specific IgG responses were established in the same MGUS cohort as for this study and were recently reported separately [6]. Hemagglutination inhibition titers were recorded according to criteria used to assess the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines [16]: i.e. seroprotection rates (percentage of vaccinees who achieved titers of 1:40 post-vaccination), seroconversion (the proportion of subjects with a 4 fold or greater rise in antibody titer from the prevaccination titer), Geometric mean titers (GMT) of HIN1 before and post-vaccination and mean fold increase (MFI) in GMT. The inferior response of MGUS patients observed by ELISA was also paralleled by HI antibody titer response. Correlations between the HI titer and serum IgG levels were observed at day 28 post-vaccination for healthy controls (Spearman's r= (Figure 1A). No titers between controls (n=19) and MGUS (n=19) were detected before vaccination. In both groups, titers of influenza specific antibodies increased after vaccination, but responses were dampened in MGUS (p=0.07). The fold increase in GMT was lower in MGUS (1.3) compared to healthy controls (2.6) (Figure 1B). The poor increase in antibody titers therefore resulted in lower seroconversion rates, with only 3 (16%) MGUS patients seroconverting compared to 42% of healthy controls. The seroprotection rates achieved in healthy controls (58%) were higher than those achieved in MGUS (42%), however without reaching significance (p=0.06). responses of H C and MGU S to H 1 N1 component of 2010 TIV.

The frequency of TIV-specific IgG memory B cells does not increase following vaccination in MGUS We have analysed the composition of the peripheral B cell pool in 5 HC and 6 MGUS patients in which additional PBMCs were available. To further explore influenza vaccination-induced alterations in the B cell compartment, we compared circulating B cell subsets at baseline to those obtained post-vaccination (day 7 and day 28). No statistically significant difference in the relative frequencies of CD27+ memory B cells and plasmablasts was observed between HC and MGUS at baseline (data not shown). Following vaccination, the frequencies of the B cell subsets remained relatively constant in HC except for plasmablasts; which showed a trend to an increase (but not statistically significant) at day 7 post-vaccination (data not shown). CHAPTER 482 Additionally, to investigate immunoglobulin expression on B cells, we evaluated the expression of IgG on IgD-CD27+ B cells. At baseline, the majority of the cells were of IgG isotype for both HC and MGUS. However, the frequency of these IgG+ cells was significantly lower in MGUS compared with HCs (p=0.05) (Figure 2A). The lower frequency of IgG+ cells in the IgD-CD27+ fraction in MGUS at baseline was due to a concomitant increase in IgM+ cells in the IgD-CD27+ fraction (p=0.0037). Furthermore, The frequency of these IgG+ c e l l s i n t h e C D 2 7+ B fraction demonstrated positive associations with the H1N1-specific serum IgG at (spearman's r=0.7494, p=0.002). Following vaccination (day 7), there was a significant decrease in the frequency of IgG+ IgD- CD27+cells in HC (p=0.04), however the decrease was not significant in MGUS. Additionally, the frequency of IgG+ in the isotype-switched CD27+ fraction at day 0 was positively correlated with the fold increase in hemagglutination inhibition titers at vaccination-induced changes in IgG responses.

The number of TIV-specific memory B cells was calculated as a % of total IgG secreting MBCs. *p<0.05HAMPERED INFLUENZA-SPECIFIC IgG B the increase in influenza-specific IgG titers is associated with higher numbers of total IgG+CD27+ cells. Influenza-specific memory B cell levels are expressed as the frequency of total IgG-switched memory B cells (total IgG secreting cells) to normalize the data for differences in cell recovery as well as for changes in the overall memory B cell population. In order to detect the effect of influenza vaccination, we assayed the number of influenza-specific IgG MBCs at day 7- and day 28 post-vaccination. There were detectable TIV-specific IgG memory B cells at baseline for both HC (range 12 to 74 per 105PBMCs) and MGUS (range 0 to 106 per 105PBMCs). However, TIV-specific IgG memory B cells were absent in 1 MGUS patient at baseline. The TIV-specific IgG memory B cells averaged 4.1% (1.6- 7.2) of total IgG memory B cells in HC and 2.6% (0- 5.6) in MGUS. Vaccination resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of TIV-specific IgG memory B cells in HC (p=0.03) but not in MGUS at day 7 post-vaccination. This resulted in HC having significantly higher percentages of TIV-specific IgG memory B cells (p=0.03) that averaged 17% of total IgG memory B cells in comparison to 4.3% in MGUS where the frequencies of the TIV-specific IgG memory B cells did not show a significant increase (Figure2C). Of note is that the number of total IgG memory B cells at day 28 post-vaccination negatively correlate with monoclonal protein concentration (Spearman's r =-0.87, p=0.03) (data not shown). MGUS patients mount significant IgA and IgM response to influenza vaccination Baseline frequencies of DN (IgD-CD27-) memory B cells as well as IgM+IgD+CD27+ memory B cells were comparable between HC and MGUS. However, vaccination resulted in an increase in the frequency of DN memory B cells at day 7 in MGUS (p=0.01) (Figure3A). Furthermore, IgM+ IgD+ CD27+ memory B cells were decreased in MGUS in response to vaccination at day 7 (p=0.01) (Figure 3B). This decrease at day 7 post-vaccination may indicate a difference in responding cells in comparison to HCs as the frequency of these cells is lower than those in HC at the same time-point (p=0.009). We further examined humoral immune responses in 19 HC and 19 MGUS patients. We determined the H1N1 influenza-specific IgM and IgA antibody responses before vaccination (day 0) as well as after vaccination (day 7 and day 28 post-vaccination). Influenza-specific IgM and IgA were detected at baseline in both HCs and MGUS. Vaccination resulted in a significant increase in both IgM (p=0.0009) and IgA (p=0.005) levels at day 7 post-vaccination in HCs with the levels being maintained at day 28 post-vaccination. Similarly, MGUS showed an increase in H1N1 influenza-specific IgM (p=0.002) (Figure 3C) and IgA (p=0.0003) (Figure 3D) antibody titers at day 7. However, MGUS had a trend to higher day 7 IgM titers in comparison to HCs, though not statistically significant (p=0.07) CHAPTER 484 DISCUSSI ON Serum titers of hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies are an universally established correlate of protection for influenza with seroprotection rate accepted as a proxy end point [17, 18]. The HI results in our study confirmed hampered vaccine-specific antibody responses as observed by IgG ELISA as we showed that MGUS had reduced HI response. Moreover, H1N1 specific IgG antibody levels correlate with the HI response[6]. The poor post-vaccination influenza specific IgG antibody levels observed in MGUS may therefore predict or mirror response to influenza vaccination. The seroprotection rate was lower in MGUS (37%) in comparison to age matched HCs (58%) suggesting that these MGUS patients are likely to be less protected by vaccination.

In this study, we see a non-significant increase in total plasmablasts at day 7 post-vaccination in both HC and MGUS. However, we did not selectively look at influenza-specific antibody secreting cells to determine the association between the serum response and effector cells. We observed TIV specific MBCs in both HC and MGUS before vaccination. This is in agreement with other studies where pre-existing influenza specific MBCs are present in the circulation [20]and reflect prior vaccination or natural infection. Previous reports have shown that following polyclonal stimulation and ELISpot, antigen-specific IgG MBCs account for up IgG memory at day30 post-vaccination [19, 20]. The responses we observed in this study were higher with TIV-specific MBCs making up to 29% of total IgG MBCs at day 7 and up to 14% at day 28 post- vaccination in HCs. The differences in the immune responses observed could be due to the differences in the composition of the TIV vaccines in the various years. Furthermore, all the HC and MGUS patients in this study were vaccinated the previous year with A/California/2009 that was present in the current TIV. Therefore, a recall response was likely to be elicited. Another difference is that the previous studies used Staphylococcus aureus Cowan, CpG and Pokeweed mitogen [19, 21] as polyclonal stimuli while we used IL-21, BAFF and CpG. There may therefore be differences in the MBC activation efficiency between the assays. However this discrepancy was accounted for by measuring the frequencies of TIV-specific MBC in the activated total MBC population rather than as numbers of TIV-specific MBC per stimulated PBMCs. The expansion of MBCs following vaccination is enriched for antigen-specific cells in HC. However, vaccination did not result in a significant increase in antigen- specific MBCs in MGUS. This poor antigen-specific memory response is likely to impair the maintenance of serologic response [22]. Notably, MGUS had lower frequencies of CD27+ cells at baseline and influenza-specific IgG secreting cells are significantly lower in response to vaccination. Moreover, the higher levels of IgG+IgD-CD27+ cells in HC at baseline were associated with higher fold-increase in the HI titers but not for MGUS implying that higher frequency of IgG+IgD-CD27+ cells are advantageous for antibody responses. Interestingly, we noted that in a subset of MGUS assayed by ELISpot, high monoclonal protein concentration is associated with lower (total) IgG MBCs following vaccination. This implies that, at least in this small subset of MGUS, high monoclonal protein concentration is associated with a limited humoral immunologic memory that will potentially limit the response to influenza vaccination. In the IgD- CD27+ fraction, there is a decrease in the frequency of IgG+ cells that is compensated by an increase in IgM+ cells in MGUS at day 0 before vaccination. This may then limit the repertoire of IgG+ cells that is available to respond to vaccination. While, there is evidence of hampered IgG responses in MGUS, the IgM response is not negatively affected. Indeed, serum H1N1-specific IgM titers CHAPTER 486 in MGUS were comparable to HC as they also increased following vaccination. Furthermore, the change in frequencies in IgM+ (IgD+CD27+) memory B cells frequencies at day 7 may reflect differences in responding cells between HCs and MGUS. Some IgM memory B cells may differentiate into cross-reactive IgM antibody secreting cells leading to the increase in H1N1-specific IgM as observed. The rest of the IgM memory may be recruited into the secondary response to compensate for the hampered IgG response. Interestingly, DN memory B cells are also substantially expanded in the peripheral blood of MGUS at day 7, suggesting their participation in the early phase of memory responses although their antigen specificity was not determined. Whether distinct pathways are responsible for the induction of CD27 and CD27+ memory B cells after antigen challenge remain debatable. However, these CD27- memory B cells may result from incomplete germinal center reactions therefore explaining their failure to acquire CD27 [23, 24]. This also explains their lower somatic hypermutation rates in comparison to CD27+ counterparts [25, 26]. A study by Moir and colleagues showed that influenza-specific IgG MBCs can be found in the CD27- compartment albeit at frequencies 10 times lower than in the CD27+ compartment of HC [25]. This would suggest that the influenza-specific response within the CD27IgG+ B-cell subset would not be as effective as from its CD27+ counterpart. We analyzed the relationship between memory response to influenza vaccination as well as the peripheral blood B cell subsets as they are easily accessible. However, by measuring peripheral blood B-cell subsets instead of antigen-specific B cells we indirectly assess the cells involved in the response to vaccination. Another limitation was the small group sizes of the HC and MGUS included in the different analyses. Nevertheless, we found several differences between the HC and MGUS but larger sample sizes are needed to confirm our results. In conclusion, we have shown that MGUS elicit a significant IgM and IgA antibody responses to influenza vaccination despite the restricted IgG B cell response. Poor antigen-specific memory response in MGUS is likely to impair the maintenance of serologic response. The poor IgG memory response is related to high monoclonal protein in MGUS suggesting defect in B cell immunity. REFE RENCE S 1.

MGUS is associated with increased susceptibility to infections, which may reflect altered B-cell repertoire. Methods To investigate this, we examined the IgM, IgG and IgA B-cell repertoire diversity in MGUS at baseline and after influenza vaccination (n=16) in comparison to healthy controls (HCs) (n=16). The CDR3 region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable ( IGHV ) region gene electrophoresis. Spectratype Gaussian distribution, kurtosis and skewness were quantified to measure repertoire shifts. Results Both HC and MGUS baseline spectratypes show inter-individual variability that is more pronounced in the IGHG and IGHA repertoire. Overall, baseline B cell repertoire is more altered in MGUS, with oligoclonality observed in 50% (p=0.01). Post-vaccination, significant differences emerged in MGUS in relation to M-protein levels. High M-protein concentration is associated with a more oligoclonal IgG and IgA response at day 7 post-vaccination, and in contrast to HCs vaccination also induced significant perturbations in the MGUS IgM repertoire at day 7 (p=0.005). Conclusion Monoclonal expansion in MGUS has an effect on the baseline B cell repertoire and influences the recruited repertoire upon vaccination.MONOCLONAL PARAPROTEIN INFLUENCES BASELINE B CELL REPERTOIRE DIVERSITY... 593 INTRODUCTION Aging is associated with changes in the functioning of the immune system that is manifest as poor responses to infections and vaccination [1-3]. As antibody responses are the mainstay of protection against many infectious agents, recent investigations have focused on amelioration of the humoral responses in aging, including underlying B-cell repertoire shifts [4-6]. During aging, the emergence of a non-malignant condition like Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) in the elderly may further alter this susceptibility to infection or response to vaccination. MGUS is a condition that is generally identified surreptitiously, and arises from monoclonal expansion of plasma cells in the bone marrow, with potential to transform to full malignancy such as multiple myeloma [7, 8]. In MGUS, the expansion of plasma cells results in the secretion of elevated levels of monoclonal protein (M-protein), which can increase to reflect a further expansion [9, 10]. MGUS is associated with hypogammaglobulinaemia in20-28% of cases [11-13] possibly reflecting an impact of the monoclonal clone on normal plasma cells in the BM niche. Accordingly, these changes in humoral capacity are likely to play a part in the increase in susceptibility to infection and decreased response to vaccination. A two-fold increased risk of bacteremia as well as a broad range of bacterial and viral infections has been described in MGUS patients compared to the general population [14]. These include pneumonia, influenza and herpes zoster infections [15, 16]. Furthermore, high monoclonal protein at diagnosis of MGUS has also been shown to be associated with higher risks of developing infections. [15] Besides the increased risk of infections, significantly depressed background antibody levels to a number of common infectious antigens have been reported, notably to pneumococcal, [16]. Responses to vaccination in MGUS remain poorly understood. Of infectious agents, influenza is a significant morbidity factor in aging and influenza vaccination is recommended in this high-risk group [17]. Influenza vaccination has an efficacy of 70% in healthy young adults [18], but the efficacy is decreased in the normal elderly population [19, 20]. In MGUS specifically, we have recently shown that the humoral immune response to influenza vaccination negatively correlates with the size of the M-protein [21]. MGUS patients with high M-protein levels elicited poor responses compared to age matched controls and this implies that high M-protein is a marker of underlying B cell dysregulation resulting in the poor immune response [21]. There is therefore a clear need to understand the nature of this immune dysregulation in MGUS patients, in order to develop strategies to counter their elevated susceptibility to infections and decreased response to vaccination.CHAPTER 594 B cell dysregulation impacts on the B cell repertoire and diversity can be mapped by analyzing the immunoglobulin variable region ( IGV) gene repertoire [22]. The Complementary Determining Region 3 (CDR3) covers the junctional region where the 3 segments ( IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ ) are joined[23]forming the core antigen-binding site in an antibody molecule [22]. CDR3 diversity is therefore a critical measure of functional diversity of any B cell repertoire. In a normal diverse B cell population a large number of clones derived from random V(D)J rearrangements result in a Gaussian distribution of CDR3 sizes. Where repertoire is perturbed, as with biases in repertoire usage or clonal expansions, the CDR3 distribution is altered and can be assayed by spectratyping [24, 25]. Spectratyping has been used to show that the B cell repertoire is compromised in the elderly. Aging is associated with oligoclonal expansions of cells and a collapse in the diversity of the B cell repertoire [4]that correlates with a general phenotype of frailty [26]. Vaccination has also been shown to induce changes in the B-cell repertoire. However, these changes are attenuated in aging and resolution of the response differs. Importantly, the IgM and IgA responses were impaired in the elderly and challenge resulted in smaller CDR3 sizes [4]. The onset of a monoclonal expansion in the elderly may further alter repertoire diversity, and thus far this has not been evaluated. To address this, we sought to delineate the baseline B cell repertoire in MGUS and humoral response to vaccination against influenza. We hypothesized that monoclonal plasma cell expansions in MGUS located in the BM may further alter the aging humoral response. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the B cell repertoire using spectratype resolution of the CDR3 region of IGHV genes and modeled data to assess diversity in MGUS patients before and after influenza vaccination. MET HODS Volunteers and sample collection MGUS patients from the University Medical Centre Groningen hematology department and age-matched healthy controls were recruited during the 2010-2011 influenza vaccination season. The MGUS patients fulfilled the standard diagnostic criteria for MGUS: serum M protein levels <30g/L, clonal plasma cells in bone marrow <10% and no myeloma related dysfunction or other B-cell proliferative diseases. All participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The institutional medical ethics committee of University Medical Centre Groningen approved the study. All participants received influenza vaccination (Influvac 2010/2011, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Netherlands) and blood samples were collected prior to the vaccination, as well as 7 days and 28 days post-vaccination. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the blood by density gradient centrifugation of CPT Vacutainer tubes (BD). PBMCs were then MONOCLONAL PARAPROTEIN INFLUENCES BASELINE B CELL DIVERSITY... 595 frozen RPMI 1640 (Cambrex Bioscience, 10% dimethylsulfoxide(Merck, Germany). PBMCs were stored in liquid nitrogen until further use. Nucleic acid extraction and cDNA synthesis Total DNA and RNA were extracted using the Qiagen Allprep DNA/RNA mini kit according to the manufacturers' specifications. First strand cDNA was synthesized from RNA following standard protocols using Superscript-III (Invitrogen) in a reverse transcriptase system (Promega). Spectratypes cDNA was used for the amplification of the IGH gene CDR3 region using a PCR with primers specific for the constant regions C D (GGAAGAAGCCCTGGACCAGGC), C\u00b5 (CAGGAGACGAGGGGGAA) or C J (CACCGTCACCGGTTCGG) in combination with Fw3Fam (ACACGGCTGTGTATTACTGT). The cDNA was amplified in 25 cycles of 98\u00b0c (45s), 45s annealing temperature of 61\u00b0c/55\u00b0c/55\u00b0c for alpha, gamma and mu respectively, 45s at 72\u00b0c and 1 final cycle of 5min at 72\u00b0c. This was done in a 25\u00b5l reaction mixture containing 20mM each of dNTP, 10\u00b5M of each primer (Fw3Fam plus one of the isotype specific primers), 0.2 Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB, Hitchin, UK) in a 5X reaction buffer containing 1.5mM MgCl2. 5\u00b5l of each reaction sample was added to 1.5\u00b5l Tamra 350 size standard in formamide and run on the ABI 3730 xl capillary sequencer. Multiple different methods and software tools for high CDR3 spectratyping analysis have been utilized; mainly on T cell repertoires [27-29]. However, in this study, raw spectratype data (fragment sizes) was analyzed and peak profiles visualized using Genescan software (Applied Biosystems) where the fluorescence intensity of each band was depicted as a peak. Data was then exported to Excel and frequency distributions of the CDR3 lengths were obtained. For further analysis, the Excel files were then imported into the R statistical programming environment (R Development Core Team, 2011) and the raw peak data was normalized so that the relative proportion of DNA fragments per CDR3 size was determined before spectratype curves were generated. A reference Gaussian distribution was generated using the mean and SD from each sample and B cell repertoire diversity was assessed by comparing the mean CDR3 size and correlating the spectratype to the reference Gaussian distribution (CGD). The divergence from the reference Gaussian distribution is therefore a direct measure of the corresponding repertoire diversity. To take account the shape of the spectratype distribution; the variability of the data, kurtosis and skewness were measured for each spectratype distribution. Kurtosis measures the distribution of the peaks, how much data is located at the tails as opposed to a distinct peak near the mean. Normally distributed data is given a value of zero while data that is CHAPTER 596 mainly centrally located near the mean and decline rapidly with a slim tail is given a positive value (leptokurtosis, k> 0). A negative value is given to a distribution when there is more data in the tails and the peak is flatter (platykurtosis, k< 0). Skewness is a measure of symmetry of the distribution. For a symmetric distribution a value of zero is given as the mean and median values coincide. A left/ negatively skewed distribution has a left tail that is long relative to the right tail and the mean of the data is less than the median; values are less than zero. A right skewed distribution has positive a value for skewness and the right tail is longer. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad prism 5.0 (Graphpad Inc, USA). Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test and Chi squared test for categorical data were used as appropriate. For correlations between different measurements, Pearson's correlation analysis was used. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS A total of 16 MGUS patients and 16 age-matched HCs were included in this study (Table 1). Our MGUS cohort exhibited considerable heterogeneity in terms of the type and size of M protein as well as duration of the condition. The concentration of M-protein varied from unquantifiable levels to 24.8g/L. M-protein was detected by immunofixation but was unquantifiable in 7 patients by serum protein electrophoresis because the concentration was very low or the M-protein migrated in the E fraction. A concentration of 0.01g/L was therefore assigned to this subset of MGUS patients. The study demographics are shown in Table 1. Table 1.

There are various alterations in the spectratype profiles that can be seen in a deviant repertoire. These alterations affect the shape and distribution of the spectratypes and can be modeled by CGD, kurtosis and skewness. Fig 1A shows representative spectratypes and the metrics measured from 4 healthy controls at day 0 and a comparative analysis of samples from 4 MGUS patients is shown in Fig 1B. In healthy controls, a polyclonal distribution of the CDR3 spectratypes was observed, although inter-individual variability occurred, as shown by the variations in CGD, kurtosis and skewness. The B cell repertoire was variable in MGUS with some showing polyclonal distribution of the CDR3 spectratypes similar to the healthy controls. Nonetheless, loss in diversity indicated by a few dominant expansions in the CDR3 sizes was observed in a subset of MGUS patients. These oligoclonal specratypes (CGD<0.6) were observed in the MGUS baseline repertoire at higher frequency than in healthy controls. 50% of the MGUS patients had oligoclonal spectratype profiles for at least one of the three IGHV immunoglobulin gene repertoire sin comparison to only one (6%) healthy control (data not shown, p=0.01). A spectratype distribution was considered to be normal (approximately symmetric) if the skewness was between -0.5 and 0.5. However, a moderately skewed distribution had skewness between -1 and -0.5 or between 0.5 and 1 while a highly skewed distribution had skewness values less than -1 or greater than 1 [30]. Based on this interpretation, 3 MGUS IGHM spectratypes showed moderate skewness compared to 2 HC samples while 5 MGUS IGHA spectratypes were moderately skewed in comparison to 3 in HC. IGHG spectratypes showed increased skewness in MGUS, with 3 MGUS IGHG samples moderately skewed and 2 were highly skewed in comparison to none in HC, in which all spectratypes were approximately symmetric. Inter-individual variability in the HCs B cell repertoire was more pronounced in the IGHG (p=0.001) and IGHA (p=0.036) spectratypes than healthy controls, 69% had IGHM CGD values of 0.9 or higher, indicating repertoire complexity as depicted by the large number of different sized CDR3 (Table 2). We subsequently investigated whether age was associated with a less diverse repertoire in HC and MGUS. No age-related changes were observed in the IGHM, IGHG or IGHA spectratypes of the healthy controls. However, age was associated with a decrease in MGUS baseline IGHG CGD index, regardless of the monoclonal protein and IGH A s p e c t r a t y p e s s h o w i n t e r - i n d i v i d u a l v a r i a b i l i t y . (A) Spectratypes from 4 example MGUS patients at day 0 show inter-individual variability that is more pronounced in IgG and IgA. The x-axis represents the CDR3 sizes in base pair and the y-axis is the frequency of occurrence of the CDR3 sizes. The table shows how the spectratypes differ between individuals as measured by the mean CDR3 size, how close the individual spectratypes match a Gaussian distribution (CGD) and the difference representative HCs show the CDR3 sizes and their distributions. Some spectratypes with a prominent (oligoclonal) CDR3 size have a high peak signal that results in lower match to CGD such as in donor 140 (IgM and IgG). (C) Age was associated with a significant decrease in IGHG CGD in MGUS patients.MONOCLONAL PARAPROTEIN INFLUENCES BASELINE B CELL REPERTOIRE DIVERSITY... 599 Vaccination induces change in the MGUS B-cell repertoire that correlates with M-protein load Following encounter with antigen, specific B cells expand and this leads to the change in baseline repertoire distribution (Fig 2A,B). There was a pronounced shift in the shapes of the spectratypes at day 7 that then return to the baseline shape at day 28. Some profiles in the MGUS patients indicated a diverse repertoire at day 0. However, in response to vaccination, there are marked differences in the spectratypes between patients (Fig 2B). Perturbations in the repertoire evidenced by oligoclonal CDR3 profiles and lower CGD were seen in some patients at day 7 that do not return to baseline values at day 28 but remain oligoclonal. In 3 MGUS patients, a perturbed repertoire with a dominant CDR3 length was seen at day 7 in response to vaccination. However, on day 28, the spectratypes remained oligoclonal but with a different pattern as a different sized dominant peak was seen (data not shown). Interestingly, distortions in some of the MGUS spectratype profiles that could be related to the monoclonal expansion of B cells in MGUS were observed in 3 of the patients. In these patients, the spectratype profiles had a major CDR3 length that is dominant in the repertoire, demonstrated as a peak expansion. The major CDR3 length dominated the profiles at all 3 time-points, before and after vaccination (Fig 2C). Of note, the dominant CDR3 length was seen in the isotype of the spectratype profile that matched the isotype of the M-protein from the MGUS patient, for example: the peak expansion was observed on IGHG spectratypes for an IgG MGUS patient. Influenza vaccination resulted in change in CGD index of the spectratypes that were mostly in the IGHG and IGHA isotypes but not in IGHM in the healthy controls. MGUS patients show a trend towards having a lower baseline IGHG repertoire diversity (p=0.07) in comparison to healthy controls (Fig 2D). Nonetheless, a significant change in the CGD similar to that of healthy controls was observed for IGHG (p=0.05) and IGHA (p=0.03) spectratypes day 7 post-vaccination. In contrast to healthy controls, there is significant repertoire perturbation in the MGUS IGHM spectratypes at day 7 (p=0.005) with the CGD returning to baseline values at day 28. This resulted in significantly lower IGHM CGD values for MGUS at day 7 in comparison to healthy controls (p=0.006). Table 2.

No change in the CDR3 size was observed in healthy controls following MONOCLONAL PARAPROTEIN INFLUENCES BASELINE B CELL REPERTOIRE DIVERSITY... 5101 vaccination for both IgM and IgG. However, there was a significant increase in the mean CDR3 length at day 7 in the IgA repertoire (p=0.05) that then returned to smaller length at day 28 as seen at baseline. There is evidence of repertoire bias towards use of longer CDR3 length in the IgG and IgA repertoire but not in IgM for MGUS patients in response to vaccination (Fig 2E). The mean CDR3 length at day 7 in MGUS was significantly higher than in healthy controls (p=0.008) for IgG. M-protein levels significantly correlated with CGD at day 7 in the IgG and IgA repertoire (Fig 2F). Higher M-protein concentration was associated with more oligoclonal response at day 7 in the MGUS IGHA repertoire, with CGD as low as 0.1, indicating expansions in a few distinct CDR3 sizes (r2= -0.51, p= 0.04). This notion that a few CDR3 sizes expand in response to vaccination is supported by the observation that leptokurtosis was significantly correlated with M-protein at day IGHA spectratypes (r2= 0.66, p=0.005). Additionally, CGD at day 7 M-protein concentration for the IGHG for IGHM. Further stratification of the MGUS patients into 2 groups based on M-protein concentration showed that M-protein >10g/L (n=7) was associated with a significantly lower CGD at day 7 post-vaccination for both IGHA (p= to MGUS with M-protein concentration <10g/L. Furthermore, we investigated whether a less diverse repertoire could predict a worse response to vaccination. H1N1-specific IgG responses were established in the same MGUS cohort as for this study and were recently reported separately [21]. We therefore looked for correlation between the spectratypes metrics and H1N1 influenza-specific IgG responses. No correlations were observed for the healthy controls. However, lower CGD at day 7 in the IGHM repertoire was associated with lower H1N1 influenza-specific IgG responses at day 28 Those with higher serum IgG response showed less perturbation in the IGHM repertoire \u0001 with IGHM spectratypes at day 7. CHAPTER 5102 DISCUSSI ON In this study we have investigated the B cell repertoire in MGUS by looking at CDR3 spectratypes at baseline and examined the effect of vaccination IGHM, IGHG and of CDR3 length diversity reflecting polyclonality of the B cells. Deviation from Gaussian distribution is considered to be a sign of oligoclonal expansions. There were inter-individual variations in the spectratype metrics in all 3 isotypes that were more prominent in the IGHG and IGHA spectratypes for both healthy controls and MGUS patients. The IGHG and IGHA samples contain isotype switched B cell populations and reflect an individual's prior antigen exposure so inter-individual variation was expected in these repertoires. Oligoclonality of the baseline spectratypes indicating lack of repertoire complexity was observed in 50% MGUS patients. It is unclear at present what underlies the increased frequency of perturbations in the MGUS peripheral B cell repertoire. The host immune system is capable of responding to pre-malignant cells [31-33], and it is plausible that the immune response against specific antigens in MGUS [34] may also lead to an alteration in the baseline repertoire that will play a role in shaping the repertoire available to respond to vaccination. This chronic immune activation has a potential in suppressing the neoplastic growth [32] but may also result in a restricted (memory) B-cell repertoire with an exhausted ability to generate expansion responses to vaccination, possibly related to the decrease in baseline IGHG CGD in MGUS, with IGHG highly relevant to B-cell response to infectious agents. The relationship between the MGUS clone and its microenvironment is important for the maintenance of the clone in the bone marrow but could also induce immune dysfunction. The observation of dendritic cells suppression in MGUS may be related to increased immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-6 [35] that interfere with dendritic cell maturation and antigen presenting capacity. Increased regulatory T cells in MGUS may also play a role in modulating the immune response [36]. Furthermore, we reported a decrease in the relative numbers of CD19+ B cells in this cohort of MGUS patients as well as a decrease in total serum IgG and IgA [21]. Hypogammaglobulinaemia is reported in ~25% of MGUS, and this may reflect the impact of the monoclonal plasma cells on pan-antibody production [13] as clonal plasma cells compete with diverse normal plasma cells for bone marrow niche space [37, 38].When we linked B-cell repertoire diversity to age in a healthy elderly cohort and contrasted these with aged individuals with MGUS, no age related differences in repertoire diversity were observed in the healthy controls. However, increased age was associated with a less diverse IGHG repertoire in MGUS indicating that other than the aging-related alterations in peripheral B cell compartment, there are also defects intrinsic to MGUS that may contribute to the repertoire alteration seen with age. The potential immunosuppression in MGUS could then make this MONOCLONAL PARAPROTEIN INFLUENCES BASELINE B CELL REPERTOIRE DIVERSITY... 5103 repertoire alteration more pronounced with advancing age. These alterations that occur in the immune system of MGUS are likely to contribute to increased risk of infections and poor vaccination response. The majority of the HCs and all the MGUS patients were vaccinated the previous year with the same H1N1 influenza strain that was included in the TIV vaccine. Therefore it is likely that the switched isotypes contain influenza specific memory B cells that will rapidly proliferate and differentiate in response to the second vaccination generating plasma cells and a discernible rise in serum antibodies with IgG being the most relevant for protection [39, 40]. There is less perturbation in the healthy controls B cell IGHM repertoire at day 7 post-vaccination presumably because a recall response is elicited to influenza vaccination. Influenza specific antibody secreting cells (ASCs) are also detected in the peripheral blood and peak 1 week after vaccination that are predominantly IgG and IgA [39] consistent with the timing of the repertoire perturbations 7 days post-vaccination. As we used RNA for analyzing immunoglobulin sequences of total peripheral B cells, and ASCs are known to produce >100-fold more mRNA than resting B cells, the change in the spectratype shapes at day 7 may also reflect the greater proportion of ASC expansion more than mature B cells. In contrast to healthy controls, vaccination induces significant perturbations in MGUS IGHM repertoire at day 7 that returns to baseline pattern at day 28. Of note is that the IGHM spectratypes reflect a repertoire that largely consists of na\u00efve B cells [41] therefore the change at day 7 suggests a perturbation of the antigen-inexperienced repertoire in MGUS. However, clonal expansions within the IgM memory population cannot be excluded in these MGUS patients. Moreover, the perturbations in the MGUS IGHM repertoire observed 7 days post-vaccination are shown to correlate to vaccine response with a perturbation in the repertoire being associated with a worse H1N1 influenza- specific IgG response. A striking observation is that high monoclonal protein is associated with more oligoclonal response at day 7 in both the IGHG and IGHA spectratypes in MGUS. Multiple myeloma monoclonal protein reflects the monoclonal plasma cell burden and it is highly likely that the relationship is the same in MGUS in which high monoclonal protein is associated with higher risk of progression [12]. This implies that high monoclonal protein is a marker of increased underlying B cell dysfunction, limiting the pool of B cells available to respond to antigenic challenge. As a consequence, a limited B cell repertoire responds to the vaccine challenge in MGUS. The observation that some spectratypes remain perturbed at day 28, but with a different sized dominant peak, suggests that many different factors may play a role in shaping the responding repertoire. It may relate also to the slow resolution of infection or another kinetic aspect of the humoral immune response altered by MGUS cells. Whether the different sized dominant peaks observed are due to an independent effect such as a secondary infection subsequent to vaccination CHAPTER 5104 remains uncertain. Spectratype distributions with a major CDR3 length of the same size dominated the profiles at all 3 time-points before and after vaccination in 19% of MGUS patients, of the same isotype as secreted M protein secreted and are most likely to reflect circulating MGUS monoclonal cells. Circulating aberrant monoclonal plasma cells have previously been detected by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry in up to 20% of MGUS [15-17]. Our results are in contrast to Ademokun et al's observation that pneumococcal vaccination resulted in expansion of clones with smaller CDR3 sizes in healthy controls [4]. MGUS spectratypes assessed in our study show that there is a preferential expansion of longer CDR3 in the IGHG and IGHA repertoire at day 7 post-vaccination. The significance of this finding is however unclear but the differences could be due to the differences in antigens and immune pathways of response as pneumococcal vaccination results in a TI-2 response and no memory while influenza vaccination results in a T-dependent response. It may also indicate differences in expression of IGHV and IGHJ genes. Long CDR3 lengths have been associated with self-reactive or polyreactive B-cells [42, 43]. Furthermore, antibodies with long CDR3 are shown to be enriched in pre-B cells and immature cells [44]; however CDR3 lengths are discerningly decreased as B cells progress through development. Memory B cells that have shorter, more hydrophilic CDR3 regions are usually more selected while na\u00efve B cells generally have the longest CDR3 regions and less mutations [41, 43, 45]. Our results are consistent with these findings in that the IGHM repertoire consists of the longest CDR3s. In summary, these results define the impact of MGUS cells on humoral immunity, and the impact of monoclonal protein burden on perturbations of the B cell repertoire induced by vaccination. We have shown that B cell repertoire diversity is altered in MGUS with oligoclonal expansions being seen in a subset of the patients. It remains to be investigated how MGUS results in the disturbance of B cell subsets composition and memory maintenance, and these studies are currently in progress in our laboratory. REFE RENCE S 1.

However, the diversification B cell repertoire in MGUS remains poorly understood but can have important implications with respect to infections and vaccination responses. Methods We therefore investigated the peripheral IgG repertoire diversity in MGUS and how vaccination affects the repertoire diversification. We carried out high throughput IGHV gene analysis in 3 high-monoclonal protein MGUS and 3 healthy controls before and 7 days after influenza vaccination. Results IGHV gene usage in MGUS was derived from all the 7 IGHV gene families and was comparable to healthy controls. IGHV1-69, IGHV1-18 and IGHV2-5 where the most dominantly used genes. When we analysed the somatic hypermutation frequencies, the MGUS baseline repertoire had increased number of reads with high mutations (>8%) indicating more frequent immune activation. Following vaccination, mutational frequencies were comparable to healthy controls. In terms of clonality, MGUS presented with a more restricted B cell repertoire at day 7 post-vaccination. In MGUS, there was an increase in average clone size that was related to the accumulation of greater numbers of larger clone sizes. Conclusion MGUS show a decrease in diversity of clones expanding in response to vaccination and it is likely that exhaustion of memory results in a B cell response made up of more antigen-inexperienced cells.B CELL REPERTOIRE DIVERSIFICATION IN MONOCLONAL GAMMOPATHY... 6111 INTRODUCTION Aging is associated with the alterations the B cell repertoire that affect the response to challenge with vaccines such as influenza where the antibody response is an established correlate of protection. Aging features oligoclonal expansion of B cells as well as the emergence of pre-malignant conditions such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) [1]. The diversification B cell repertoire in MGUS remains poorly understood but can have important implications with respect to infections and vaccination responses. Not only is the risk of infections high in MGUS, but also high monoclonal protein MGUS with elicit poor response to influenza vaccination [2,3]. By using the method of complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) spectratyping, we have shown that B cell repertoire diversity is altered in MGUS with oligoclonal expansions being seen in a subset of the patients. Furthermore, spectratyping revealed that influenza vaccination results in an oligoclonal repertoire perturbation in high monoclonal protein MGUS. Even though it is quantitative, spectratyping is not sufficient to make unbiased clonality assessment of the immunoglobulin gene repertoire as the sequence itself is not known. However, additional investigations into more detailed immunoglobulin gene repertoire usage by next generation sequencing need to be carried out in MGUS as it will provide high coverage and eliminate the bias of high mRNA in plasma cells. B cell receptor (BCR) diversity is generated from the random rearrangement of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments to provide a variety of BCRs necessary for binding diverse antigens. Additional BCR diversification is by introduction of point mutations through somatic hypermutation (SHM), a recombination process in the germinal centers through the action of activation- induced cytosine deaminase [4]. During clonal expansions, mutations can accumulate that improve antigen binding affinity. The size of the B cell repertoire in humans makes sequencing by the Sanger method challenging. Only a small pool of sequences is sampled and rare sequences in the repertoire are more likely to be lost. We therefore designed a study focused on the IgG repertoire analysis using Illumina sequencing by synthesis with 4-color cyclic reversible termination. Illumina sequencing has a greater sequencing depth [5] with an output with 25 million sequencing reads [6] and 2x250 bp paired read lengths. Paired-end sequencing can permit the identification of the immunoglobulin IGHV and IGHJ gene segments as well as characterization of IGHD gene segments. Analysis of the B cell receptor diversity will therefore give insights into B cell clonality in healthy and pre-malignant populations as well as give insight into the effect of influenza vaccination on the antibody repertoire.CHAPTER 6112 MET HODS Patient selection MGUS patients who fulfilled the standard diagnostic criteria for MGUS [7] were enrolled in this study after informed consent. The inclusion criteria were serum monoclonal protein (<30g/L), clonal plasma cells in bone marrow <10%, no myeloma related dysfunction or other B-cell proliferative diseases. Additionally, 3 HC with no malignancy, conditions associated with immune dysfunction or use of immune modulating drugs were included. All participants were vaccinated with the 2010/2011 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) virus and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus. PBMCs were isolated from day 0 before vaccination and day 7 after vaccination samples as previously described and frozen 2. After thawing, total DNA and RNA were extracted using the Qiagen Allprep DNA/RNA mini kit according to the manufacturers' specifications. Library preparation First strand cDNA was synthesized from RNA following standard protocols using Superscript-III (Invitrogen) in a reverse transcriptase system (Promega). PCR amplification of cDNA was done using Phusion high fidelity polymerase with C J forward primer containing 15 nucleotide multiplexing identifiers (MID) and illumina adapters primer sets. Amplified PCR products were visualized on electrophoresis gel and gel extracted. High throughput 250base paired-end sequencing was performed using Illumina MiSeq platform. Low sequences with quality score <Q=30 were filtered out; Q=30 corresponds to the probability P=0.001 that a base has been called incorrectly. Raw reads were then split into MID groups and Fast Length Alignment of Short reads (FLASH) [8] was used to match consensus reads from the same cluster. V-D-J assignment We used VDJFasta [9], a bioinformatics Perl extension, to explore the V-D-J recombinations from the sequences and to align the V-D-J segments. The percentage match of each IGHV sequence to germline gene with the highest homology was measured and, accordingly, somatic hypermutation was calculated to be the percentage difference from the corresponding germline gene. Clonality assessment For clonality assessment, nucleotide sequences were based on CDR3 similarity. Sequences with immunoglobulin genes CDR3 region similarity (identical or related) and using the same V and J gene segments represented clonal clusters.B CELL REPERTOIRE DIVERSIFICATION IN MONOCLONAL GAMMOPATHY... 6113 Immunodiversity Clonal clusters (clonotypes) were ordered from the largest to the smallest thereby creating a cumulative frequency distribution. Diversity index, D10, was calculated as the highest copy number clonotypes that make up 10% of the total sequences. D10=C/S x 100 Where C is the minimum number of distinct largest clones that make up 10% of total sequences and S is the total number of distinct clones. RESULTS Three MGUS and 3 HC were included in this study. The MGUS patients had an average age of 60 (range 53-66) and HC had an average age of 58 (range 53-61). The MGUS patients had monoclonal protein concentration averaging 17.1g/L (range 12.9- 22.8g/L). The duration of MGUS follow-up is shown in figure 1A. All MGUS cases had poor response to vaccination as they had low H1N1-specific IgG titers that remained low after vaccination (Figure 1B). Recognizing that we have evaluated merely three samples, our results should be considered as descriptive, as a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn. IGHV and IGHJ classification After filtering for quality, alignment of sequences to IGH germline genes and translational rescue, samples yielded an average of 420 744 sequences. The number of reads per HC samples ranged from 203 724 to 558 151 while for MGUS they ranged from 420 580 to 491 382 sequences. We compared the IGH repertoire in 3 MGUS with that in 3 HC. For each individual, the IGHV and IGHJ gene usage was calculated. The diversity of the IGHV gene usage and IGHJ gene usage in MGUS was comparable to HC at baseline. VH genes used by these MGUS cases were derived from all 7 human IGHV gene families. The most dominant IGHV gene family of the repertoire respectively with IGHV7 usage being the least frequent in HC. When we considered the individual IGHV genes the most frequent (Figure 2A). However, in HC the most frequently used IGHV genes 16.4%, 9.2% and 7.7% respectively, of all the potentially functional VH genes identified. At day 7 post-influenza vaccination, there was a slight shift in the IGHV gene usage. CHAPTER 6114 The most frequently used IGHV genes at day the most frequently day followed by IGHV3-30 (13.8%), the IGHJ gene usage, The IGHJ repertoire was similar between MGUS and HC. IGHJ4 was used in both MGUS (57.4%) IgG repertoire. IGHJ6, IGHJ3, IGHJ2 and IGHJ1 (Figure 2C). However, a slight increase in the IGHJ6 usage was noted for MGUS, with IGHJ4 representing 41% of the repertoire while IGHJ6 usage increased to 35%. IGH gene hypermutation We next performed comparative analysis of somatic hypermutation patterns between HC and MGUS. However, Illumina sequencing may introduce errors in sequences, with substitution error rate per nucleotide of 0.001% [10]. However, this is lower than the patients included in the study had high monoclonal protein B) as well as poor H1 N1-specific IgG responses at day 0, day7- and day 28 post-vaccinationB CELL REPERTOIRE DIVERSIFICATION IN MONOCLONAL GAMMOPATHY... 6115 Because all the samples were sequenced at the same time, we therefore assume that the error rate is constant in all sequences. By aligning the sequences to the reference germline genes, the frequency of mutations in the IgG repertoire was quantified. At baseline, HC show average mutational frequency of 6.6% when mutations were measured relative to the reference germline sequence. The IgG repertoire in MGUS showed mutational frequency averaging 7.4% at baseline (Figure 3A). Furthermore, MGUS baseline repertoire has a higher number of reads with >8% mutations (39%) in comparison to HC (27%). An increase in mutational frequencies in MGUS is likely to indicate more frequent immune activation as somatic hypermutation is highest in IgG memory B cells and allows for the generation of high-affinity antibodies. However, our sample size is not big enough to draw definitive conclusions. Vaccination did not result in an overall change in mutational frequencies in the HC IgG repertoire at day 7 post-vaccination (Figure 3A, 3B). The overall mutational frequency in MGUS was comparable to HC at day 7 post-vaccination. While the overall distribution seemed to be largely comparable between HC and MGUS, we found differences for reads with a lower number of mutations. There was an increase in day 7 sequences (52.1% of sequences) with lower mutational frequencies of 2-6% in comparison to baseline repertoire (37%) (Figure 3C). Silent v non-silent mutations were investigated in HC and MGUS. Silent (synonymous) mutations do not result in the replacement of amino acids, as opposed to non-synonymous mutations. However, the frequency of both silent and non-silent mutations was comparable between HC and MGUS at both time points (data not shown). Clonality We quantified the effect of sequence diversification by analyzing the number of clones and also clone size. At baseline, the average clone size was comparable between HC and MGUS; with the HC averaging 36 sequences per clone and MGUS also averaging 36. Vaccination was associated with a decrease in the average clone size in the HC IgG repertoire at day 7 post-vaccination; average 21.4. This is related to an increase in the proportion of smaller clone sizes at day 7. However, in 2 of the 3 MGUS cases, an increase in the average clone size was observed at day 7 post-vaccination (Figure 4A). This indicates accumulation of greater numbers of larger clones. Clone sizes of 100- 1 000 show an increased accumulation in MGUS in comparison to HC. At day 7 post-vaccination, clones of sizes 100- 1 000 averaged 7.7% of all clones in MGUS which is an increase from an average of 4.2% at baseline (Figure 4B, 4C). In HC clones of sizes 100- 1 000 averaged 3% at day 7; which is a decrease from 4.1% at baseline. In the remaining MGUS case, a decrease in the average clone size was seen which was comparable to HC. We further investigated the clonality of the IgG repertoire by quantifying the fraction of sequences represented by the biggest clone at baseline and at gene usage. The relative frequencies of individual IGHV gene usage were calculated for each individual A) at day 0 and B) at day 7 post-vaccination were identified from the immunoglobulin gene sequences using VDJ Fasta. C) IGHJ family gene usage in HC (dark columns, day 0 followed by day 7) were compared to MGUS (grey columns, day 0 then day 7). One sequence per clone was chosen to represent each clonotype.

At baseline, the biggest clones were of comparable size between HC (average 3.7%) and MGUS (average 3.5%). Following vaccination, the biggest clone in the HC IgG repertoire decreased and accounted for an average of 1.8% of the sequences. However, in MGUS an increase in the clone size was observed with the biggest clone representing an average of 10.5% of the repertoire (Figure 4D). To investigate whether there is decreased diversity (increased clonality) of the repertoire, we further looked at the minimal number of clones that make up at least 10% of the IgG repertoire. We assumed that the most abundant clones at day 7 post-vaccination are the clones that expand in response to vaccination. There was CHAPTER 6118 Figure 4. Differences in clonality of the H C and MGUS IgG IGHV repertoire in response to vaccination. A) The average clone size was calculated for HC and MGUS at day 0 and day 7 post- vaccination.

However, a trend to an increase in diversity of the IgG repertoire was observed in HC at day 7 post-vaccination with increased number of clones accounted for at least 10% of the repertoire (Figure 4E). This implies that vaccination resulted in expansion of more but smaller sized clones in HC. In contrast to HC, MGUS showed a decrease B CELL REPERTOIRE DIVERSIFICATION IN MONOCLONAL GAMMOPATHY... 6119 in the diversity of clones that made up at least 10% of the repertoire. In MGUS, there is a decrease in repertoire diversity day 7 post-vaccination in comparison to baseline as well as in comparison to HC. This small pool of diversity is due to expansion of a few distinct large clones in MGUS in response to vaccination. This implies that the IgG B cell diversity of cells that respond to vaccination is limited. DISCUSSI ON In this study, we evaluated the B cell response in MGUS using illumina paired-end sequencing. We investigated the IgG IGHV repertoire from PBMCs using RNA from 3 MGUS and 3 HCs. We utilized the 2010/2011 TIV as antigen challenge in order to investigate the IgG B cell responses following vaccination. To analyze the vaccine- induced changes in repertoire we used samples from day 7 post-vaccination since plasmablast response peaks around day 7 [12]. Of interest is whether the reduced IgG response to influenza vaccination in MGUS is due to a decrease in repertoire diversity; whether immune suppression and the repeated immune stimulation by unrelated antigens limits the repertoire available to respond to vaccine challenge. We observed variations between the IgG B cell repertoire of MGUS and HC in response to influenza vaccination. We showed that HC responded with diverse B cell populations, whereas MGUS presented with a more restricted B cell repertoire at day 7 post-vaccination. In MGUS, the increase in average clone size was related to the accumulation of greater numbers of larger clone sizes. The distribution of clones in MGUS was different from that observed in HC as fewer but larger clones encompassed up to 10% of the of the total sequence reads. In agreement with this, the largest clone sizes in MGUS were at least 2 times the size of HC. The most abundant clones at day 7 after TIV vaccination likely resemble memory-derived IgG plasmablasts that are increased in the circulation at that time [12]. The decreased diversity of clones in response to influenza vaccination may therefore restrict the antibody response in MGUS. Furthermore, higher mutational frequencies in the baseline repertoire of MGUS may limit optimal affinity maturation of the antibodies in the face of antigenic challenge. The higher mutational frequencies are likely due to longer or more frequent exposures to antigen in MGUS. Because we analysed the peripheral B cell compartment, we expect that the IgG repertoire contains recirculating memory B cells that have encountered a variety of antigens and are likely to contain high mutations in comparison to a more na\u00efve/ less antigen experienced repertoire. We analysed IGHV gene usage in order to determine whether usage of particular gene families or individual genes is associated with skewing of the MGUS IgG antibody repertoire. Comparison of peripheral B cells of MGUS with those of HC did not reveal significant bias in IGHV and IGHJ family usage. This is not surprising considering that the MGUS-specific clone makes up a minor part of the peripheral repertoire in a subset of MGUS unlike in MM where there is increased CHAPTER 6120 detection of monoclonal MM cells in blood. The most dominant clones in the MGUS peripheral repertoire accounted for 3.5% of all the reads therefore they cannot cause a significant gene usage bias. Because we used RNA for analyzing the immunoglobulin sequences, and plasma cells are known to produce up to a 1000 fold more RNA than resting B cells, bias towards picking up the same plasma cells several times over may be expected. However, since the HC and MGUS samples did not show a difference in their total IgG positive cells as well as plasmablasts before and after vaccination and the samples were all analysed at the same time under the same conditions, we do not expect the bias to affect one group more than the other. More samples need to be included in order to explore the variations in clonality as well as the clonal diversification between MGUS and HC in response to vaccination. In summary, our study demonstrates normal IGHV gene usage in MGUS. However, a decrease in the diversity of expanded clones in response to TIV was observed in MGUS. REFE RENCE S 1.

CHAPTER Summary and discussion Sarah M. Tete7SUMMARY AND DI SCUSSION 7125 IMMU NE ALTE RATIONS IN MONOCLONAL OF UNDETERMINED SIGNIFICANCE Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is known to be associated with aging where immunosenescence advances as a common feature. Indeed, MGUS predominantly affects the elderly, with a median age of diagnosis of 70 [1]. However, it has been recently established that MM almost invariably arises from preceding MGUS [2,3]. Even so, not all cases of MGUS progress to MM or related plasma cell proliferative disorders. In the MGUS-MM transition, a number of changes in the bone marrow microenvironment where the non-malignant MGUS clone is maintained most likely occur. Among these, there is evidence that loss of immune control is implicated in malignant transition [4]. It is still a challenge to predict which MGUS cases will progress to a malignant gammopathy following diagnosis, when a 'watch and wait' clinical decision is implemented. However, there are several clinical markers that are used as guidelines for monitoring MGUS progression, as treatment is not currently an option. Based on the levels of monoclonal protein, excess free light chains and monoclonal protein isotype, the risk of progression is stratified [5]. Identifying the MGUS patients who will progress will clearly benefit from early preventative therapeutic intervention, and this is currently a major goal in disease management. Understanding the immune system and microenvironment in MGUS therefore has a great clinical relevance. How the MGUS clone influences the immune system, in both progressive and non-progressive MGUS, is largely unknown. In Chapter 2 we review the status of immune alterations in MGUS as well as MM. There is immune dysfunction in MGUS that increases as the monoclonal gammopathy progresses to active MM. The intrinsic defect in the production of immunoglobulins presents as hypogammaglobulinaemia that accelerates with disease progression [6]. Significant decrease in circulating CD19+ B cells is a prominent finding with this depression correlating with disease stage [7,8]. Furthermore, increased monoclonal protein is associated with the increased accumulation of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow and elevated production [9]. The clonal plasma cells progressively replace the normal bone marrow plasma cells and are also found in the circulation as disease progresses. There are also aberrations in dendritic cell (DC) and T cell counts as well as function that will impact on the B cell response [7,8,10]. As a result of immune dysfunction, infections are a frequent occurrence in MGUS and MM [11-13]. Also of consideration is that MGUS and MM typically affect an older population who are affected by age-related immunosenescence, so a combination of therapy, age and disease-related alterations in the immune system contribute to the increased risk of infections in these patients. In patients with hematological malignancies, the degree of immunosuppression and exposure to immunosuppressive therapy is variable and also data concerning CHAPTER 7126 efficacy of vaccination in these patients varies. With respect to the underlying disease and the immunosuppressive treatment, safety and efficacy of vaccines is of considerable importance. Protective efficacy of conventional vaccination is questionable in patients with acquired immunodeficiency as in MM as they display an array of immune dysfunctions, which may influence their response to conventional vaccination. The loss of immune capacity in MM is evident in studies that investigated the response to influenza, pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenza type b ( Hib) vaccination [14-16]. The goal of vaccination is to decrease the risk of infections as well as the associated morbidity and mortality. The available evidence on the efficacy of vaccination in both MGUS and MM is as yet inadequate. Thus far, no vaccination studies have been carried out systematically in the early stage of monoclonal gammopathy, in MGUS. In Chapter 3 , we therefore investigated the impact of MGUS on the humoral and cell-mediated response to vaccination with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). MGUS patients present with immune response with striking variability. However, this is not surprising considering that MGUS patients are a heterogeneous group with variations in the duration of the condition and also covering a spectrum from healthy persons with stable and low monoclonal protein concentrations to patients that border transformation to MM. Indeed, some have influenza H1N1- specific IgG titers as well as H1N1-specific IFN- J-secreting cell frequencies that are comparable to healthy controls. Remarkably, MGUS with high monoclonal protein had lower influenza H1N1-specific IgG titers, which they failed to expand post- vaccination. Contrary to HCs, MGUS patients revealed impaired T-cell responses, as the number of IFN- J-secreting cells did not increase post-vaccination. Further expanding on the IgG response, MGUS achieved seroprotection rates (37%) that were low compared to healthy age-matched adults (58%) for H1N1 ( Chapter 4 ). This response parallels the overall IgG response with correlations being observed between the HI titer and serum IgG levels at day 28 post-vaccination. In chapter 4, we went further to investigate whether the inferior response to influenza vaccination in high monoclonal protein MGUS was associated with an alteration in memory B cell response. Notably, high monoclonal protein in MGUS is associated with lower numbers of IgG secreting memory B cells. MGUS reveal a restricted influenza-specific memory B cell response that may impair the maintenance of serologic memory. The decrease in the frequency of IgG+ cells within the IgD- CD27+ compartment may explain the poor serum antibody response and also the restricted memory B cell response to influenza vaccination in high monoclonal protein MGUS. A decrease in na\u00efve, IgD- CD27+ switched memory B cells as well as a decrease in plasma cells has been reported with age. Consequently, vaccination has limited success with poor antibody responses to vaccination being elicited. Influenza vaccination is of limited efficacy in aging as there is a decrease in influenza-specific antibody generation [17-19]. Seroprotection against influenza is SUMMARY AND DI SCUSSION 7127 reduced in the aging population. Indeed, in adults aged 60-74 years seroprotection is 41- 58%, and 29-46% in those aged over 75 years. This is low in comparison to young adults were seroprotection rates are >70% [20]. Since the seroprotection rates are lower in MGUS in comparison to age matched healthy controls, MGUS is an important factor influencing the outcome of vaccination and not the age of the vaccinees. There was a degree of compensation for the poor IgG response in MGUS, with an increased involvement of IgM memory and perturbations in the IgM repertoire, as judged in response to vaccination at day 7. Nonetheless, the IgM response in MGUS was not sufficient to achieve seroprotective antibody titers (hemagglutination inhibition titers >40). IgM+IgD+CD27+ B been considered responsible for the secretion of low-affinity natural antibodies in healthy adults [21, 22]. Therefore, this possibly explains the poor seroprotective antibody titers in MGUS despite the high IgM levels. Our studies suggest dysfunction of long-term serologic memory and indicate the importance of functional B cell response for protection against infection. Studies that investigated the status of serologic antibody responses to staphylococcal, moraxella, pneumococcal and varicella zoster antigens showed depressed background antibody levels in MGUS and MM [23]. B CELL REPERTOIRE IN MGUS AN D VACCINATION INDUCED REPERTOIRE PERTURBATION Because B cell dysregulation is associated to the B cell repertoire, we analysed B cell diversity in response to influenza vaccination in MGUS contrasting them to age-matched HCs. In Chapter 5 , we assessed the B cell repertoire by amplifying the CDR3 region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) region gene and assayed the CDR3 size distribution by spectratyping. HCs typically have a diverse IGHV repertoire at day 0, and in response to vaccination clonal expansions are evident at day 7 with the repertoire resolving by day28 post-vaccination. It has been previously demonstrated by spectratyping that the B cell repertoire is compromised in the elderly. The changes associated with aging involve the oligoclonal expansions of cells and a collapse in the diversity of the B cell repertoire. This loss in B cell repertoire diversity correlates with a general phenotype of frailty [24]. A study of combined influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in the elderly (>70 years) showed that the a decreased B cell repertoire diversity, as measured by spectratyping, correlated with impaired IgA and IgM anti-pneumococcal antibody responses [25]. The MGUS B cell repertoire in our study showed inter-individual variability with up to 50% showing oligoclonality in at least one of the three immunoglobulin isotypes studied. Indeed, these cases presented with oligoclonal spectratype profiles. The clonal expansions in the periphery contribute to the limited repertoire CHAPTER 7128 and poor antibody response in MGUS. Furthermore, circulating MGUS clonal plasma cells can be detected by spectratyping in a small subset of patients. Circulating clonal ('tumor') plasma cells are present in up to 20% of MGUS patients [26,27] and spectratyping can detect these clonal cells in this subset of MGUS. Circulating clonal plasma cells have been previously detected in both MGUS and MM and they could be part of the malignant plasma cell compartment which has the potential to re-circulate to new location and spread disease. This could explain the increased frequency of circulating myeloma plasma cells in progressive disease and the dissemination throughout the bone marrow [28]. Not only was high monoclonal concentration in MGUS associated with poor influenza-specific IgG responses, but also with a more oligoclonal IgG and IgA response at day 7 post-vaccination that suggests that the clonal response in MGUS is limited to restricted antigen-responding B cell clones. In Chapter 6 , we expanded our B cell repertoire analysis by massive parallel sequencing of the IgG IGHV repertoire using next generation sequencing and specifically focusing the analysis on MGUS with high monoclonal protein. In agreement with the spectratyping data, there was an oligoclonal accumulation of larger clones in the MGUS repertoire that also relates to the increase in average clone size. Furthermore, there was a decrease in the IGHV diversity of the clones that expanded in response to vaccination. The higher mutational frequencies seen in the baseline MGUS repertoire are likely due to longer or more frequent exposures to antigen. We expect that the IgG repertoire contains recirculating memory B cells that have encountered a variety of antigens and are likely to contain high mutations in comparison to a more na\u00efve/ less antigen experienced repertoire. Prospective studies are necessary to investigate the memory B cell response and memory maintenance in MGUS. These studies need to be able to identify influenza-specific memory B cells after a first round of vaccination as well as after a second round of vaccination with the same influenza antigen a year later. A recent study has shown that haemagglutinin specific B cells can be sorted by flow cytometry thus allowing further repertoire IGHV gene analysis [29]. MONOCLONAL PROTEIN: THE MGUS CLONE PROMOTING IMMU NE DYSFUNCTION With seminal findings establishing that MGUS precedes MM and that MGUS patients will develop malignant monoclonal gammopathy at the rate of 1% per year, the influence of the MGUS clone on the immune host function is of importance. Clonal MGUS plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow and may affect normal plasma cells at this site. The concentration of monoclonal protein most likely reflects clonal plasma cell accumulation levels in the bone marrow. The decrease in serum IgG levels and appearance of hypogammaglobulinaemia in MGUS may be related SUMMARY AND DI SCUSSION 7129 to this competitive replacement of long lived bone marrow plasma cells from their bone marrow niche by the expanded MGUS clone [9]. Mature bone marrow plasma cells contribute significantly to serum immunoglobulin levels [30] and their displacement from niches may therefore explain the lower IgG levels in some MGUS subjects. The proportion of normal bone marrow plasma cells has been shown to be predictive for the progression of MGUS as well as disease outcome in MM [31]. During normal B cell activation or plasma cell differentiation, antigen, activation strength and co-stimulatory factors may regulate the entrance into pool of long-lived plasma cells. Theses bone marrow plasma cells have higher affinity than corresponding memory B cells [32]. However, the number of bone marrow niches is limited and have been shown to be functionally impaired with age [33,34]. The MGUS clone can impact on immune function specifically, for instance with the autocrine synthesis of IL-6 [35]. In comparison to HCs, IL-6 levels have been reported to be increased in MGUS. IL-6 is immunosuppressive to DCs [36] by interfering with their maturation and antigen presenting capacity. DCs have a central role in the initiation and coordination of the immune response to influenza, inducing T cell proliferation. Increased IL-6 may therefore inhibit Th1 responses. This may explain the poor Th1 response in high monoclonal protein MGUS. Immunosurveillance has a role in controlling the stepwise progression of the MGUS clone [4]. It is also conceivable that the immune response against specific antigens in MGUS play a role in limiting the repertoire available to respond to vaccination and explain the oligoclonality seen in the is altered in MGUS. The MGUS IgG repertoire is more clonal at baseline (circle size represents clonal size). Oligoclonality of the repertoire is evident in MGUS and (day 7) following influenza vaccination, the recruited repertoire is significantly perturbed in with a few expanded clones dominating the response. CHAPTER 7130 in our observations. Chronic immune activation leads to formation of new plasma cells hence more competition for survival niches [32]. This may however shorten the longetivity of resident bone marrow plasma cells. Chronic immune activation may also exhaust the ability of the memory B-cell repertoire to generate expansion responses to vaccination [37,38]. A consequence of the limited B cell diversity available to respond to viral challenge is that few clones dominate the response to influenza vaccination (chapter 6). We therefore speculate that monoclonal protein concentration in MGUS reflects the level of underlying immune suppression, with the increase in monoclonal protein being associated with the gradation of immune suppression. As a result, immune responses are poor and vaccination is less effective. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES: IMPR OVING INFLUENZA VACCINE EFFICACY IN MGUS The goal of vaccination is to decrease the risk of infections and associated morbidity and mortality. Influenza specific IgG responses are decreased in high monoclonal protein MGUS: in the light of poor influenza-specific responses in MGUS, as shown in this thesis, more effective vaccinations are required to provide protection from influenza, and other infectious agents that compromise disease management. For favorable clinical outcomes, it is important to introduce vaccination at the right time to the appropriate patient group. MGUS are a heterogeneous group with the duration of condition as well as the monoclonal protein concentration varying considerably between individuals. Therefore, influenza vaccination should be recommended early in MGUS as it may be beneficial; especially to the low monoclonal protein MGUS cohort. Other than the low number of participants in our study that may limit definitive conclusions, another limitation was that we studied only the immune response to vaccination but not the vaccine clinical efficacy in preventing laboratory confirmed influenza illness. Boosting vaccination can be promising for improving protection at early stages of monoclonal gammopathies where priming is inadequately immunogenic. Therefore, re-vaccination may provide protection as immune dysfunction is less severe compared to the more advanced stages of active disease. Furthermore, adjuvants may benefit the activation of the innate immune system so as to enhance humoral and cellular immune responses. There is a defect in both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system in monoclonal gammopathies that affect vaccine efficacy. Adjuvants increase the level of inflammatory mediators at the site of injection and can stimulate DCs and CD4+ T cell priming [39-41]. TLR agonists as adjuvants could reverse the seen in high monoclonal protein MGUS. TLR agonists such as GLA-SE can promoting cytokines E, emulsion-based AS03A is highly immunogenic, enhancing the antibody and CD4+ T cell mediated responses to vaccination [44] and inducing long term protection [45]. In light of the poor immune response in MGUS and MM, it is fundamental to understand the underlying immune defects before effective vaccination strategies to optimize immunogenicity can be developed. Other than the conventional split and subunit influenza vaccines, new vaccines are under development that promising opportunities to modify vaccine design in order to activate specific immune pathways to counter influenza infection. Similar strategies may enhance immunity in MGUS and MM to other infectious agents important in disease. For these interventions, it will be crucial to fully understand the relationship between the tumor clone (pre-malignant and malignant) and immune microenvironment. The studies presented in this thesis are a step in this direction. REFE RENCE S 1. Reyes E, Prieto A, Carrion F, Garcia- Suarez J, Esquivel F, Guillen C, et al.

Ex Vivo Analysis of Human Memory B Lymphocytes Specific for A and B Influenza Hemagglutinin by DGEMENTS After a long 4 years adventure that brought me here to Groningen, the journey is over. As great as it feels to see all the chapters finished, it feels even better for me to look back at the journey and realize how many great individuals inspired me and gave me encouragement throughout my PhD. I express my gratitude to all the people who helped me through and I will not forget how important you were to my professional up build but also to my personal life. To my promoter, Prof Nicolaas Bos, I am grateful that you gave me this opportunity to work with you. I have learnt a great deal from you: You fed my scientific curiosity, and allowed me to develop as an independent researcher. Thank you for your unlimited support and enthusiasm. Your enthusiasm overflows that you sometimes can get sucked up in it as you light up to share your ideas. I began to understand that being enthusiastic is believing in what you are working on, meeting challenges and willing to work hard to achieve your goals. I would also like to thank my co-promoter, Dr Surinder Sahota. You saw potential in me and you took the risk of supervising me as well recommending me to Prof Nico Bos considering that I was coming straight from my Bachelor studies in Pharmacology and jumping right into the deep end of PhD research. I have learnt and developed a lot while working in your lab. You provided me with a vibrant and a success oriented research environment. I will always be grateful for your generous support and guidance. Dear Dr Marc Bijl, I am extremely grateful for the guidance and constant support you gave me in setting up my project.
