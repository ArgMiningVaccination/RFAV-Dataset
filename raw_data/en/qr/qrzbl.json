Prior to your surgery, you will have to prepare yourself and your home. After your surgery, there is also a lot you must do as you return to a healthy and active lifestyle. This guidebook provides you with the information and tools needed to prepare for and recover from your total joint replacement surgery. It is divided into sections to provide information at each stage of the process. Remember, this is a guide. Your clinical team may add to or change recommendations. Surgical Approaches There are several different surgical approaches for total hip replacement. Your surgeon will discuss which is best for you. The most common approaches include a posterior (back) approach, a lateral (side) approach, a combination of the two, or an anterior (front) approach. II. SELF MANAGEMENT PLAN Preoperative Overview During the next couple of weeks, there are a number of items to coordinate and complete to ensure you have the optimal experience and outcomes for your joint replacement procedure. It is critical that you engage with our team to familiarize yourself with the process and commit to a plan to manage your care journey. The following section outlines some of the critical components. Obtain Medical and/or Specialist Approval for Surgery You will receive instructions from your surgeon's office regarding receiving a medical and/or specialty physician exam and approval to proceed with surgery. This may also include a dental exam. These evaluations and approvals are required prior to undergoing anesthesia. Register/Attend Preoperative Education Class The preoperative class provides you with the opportunity to learn about what to expect over the next few weeks along with key points to a successful recovery. The class is free and is taught by members from your professional orthopedic team. To register for the class, please call the orthopedic program phone number (located in the resource section of this guidebook) for the hospital where you are scheduled for surgery. Preparations Prior to Surgery Most patients can return safely directly to their homes after joint replacement surgery. You will be most comfortable and able to maneuver easily at home. To help make your recovery as smooth as possible, planning should begin well before your surgery. You and your family can prepare your home prior to surgery in order to make your transition home easier and prevent injury to your new joint. It is recommended that you have a safety network of friends, family or neighbors to provide a daily check-in, either by phone or in-person, arranged for once you reach home. (A checklist to prepare your home is at the back of this guidebook.) Pre-Admission Testing Prior to surgery, in addition to your medical and/or specialist appointments, you may need to come to the hospital for additional tests and screenings. If required, you will be contacted to schedule the visit. This appointment takes approximately 60 minutes and can be arranged to coincide with your visit to the hospital for the preoperative education class. (Please see the resource section at the back of this guide for Preadmission Testing location phone numbers.) Identify a Coach We encourage you to designate a family member or close friend as your coach. Your coach will work with you during each step of your surgical process, beginning with the preoperative education class, to inpatient recovery, and then discharge home. Your coach's role is to: K Provide motivation and encouragement K Assist with preparing your home for safe return K Understand discharge instructions and medications K Recognize signs and symptoms of complications 3 4Anatomy of the Hip One of the body's largest joints, the hip is made up of the top of the thigh bone (a ball) and it fits into a socket in the pelvis (acetabulum). It is surrounded by ligaments, tendons, and muscles to give the hip a combination of stablility and movement. There is also a smooth, durable covering (articluar cartilage) that is a cushion between the joint. All the parts normally work together to allow easy pain-free movement. The Total Hip Replacement There are many different materials and designs used for hip replacement. Prior to your replacement, your orthopedic surgeon will choose the type that is best for you. During your surgery, the damaged parts of your joint will be replaced by a new ball and socket that fit together to maximize your motion and function. After your surgery is complete, an x-ray will be performed to make sure the alignment of the implants is appropriate. Then the incision is closed with staples or stitches, and you are taken to the recovery room. Normal Hip Rounded Socket (acetbulum) Articular Cartilage Femoral Head Thighbone (femur) PRE-SURGERY EXERCISE PLAN Perform each exercise 20 times. A. Arm Push-Ups K Sit in an armchair. Place your hands on the armrests. K Straighten your arms, raising your bottom up off the chair, if possible. K Feet should be flat on floor. B. Gluteal Sets (Butt squeezes) K Lie down or recline. K Squeeze your buttocks muscles together. Hold for a count of five. C. Quad Sets (Knee push-downs) K Tighten the muscles on the front of your thigh. K Try to fully straighten your knee and touch the back of your knee to the bed. K Hold fully straight and count to five. D. Hamstring Sets K Lie on your back with leg bent slightly at knee. K Push heel into bed by tightening the muscles of your hamstring. K Hold fully straight and count to five. A B C D K It can also be stressful to rely on others to help while you are healing. However, having support from friends and family is of great benefit. At Hackensack Meridian Health, resources are available (social workers, counselors, spiritual care, etc.) if you need additional support. Remember to ask for help when you need it. K Have realistic goals and keep a positive outlook. Celebrate small achievements. Preparing for Enhanced Surgical Recovery A healthy body promotes good healing. Prior to your surgery, focus on the following: K Nutrition: Eat healthy foods such as vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains and lean protein. K Smoking Cessation: Quit smoking. Smoking impairs oxygen circulation to your healing joint. Oxygen circulation is vital to the healing process. If you need assistance with quitting smoking, please notify your primary care physician. K Pre-op Exercise: Start your preoperative exercise (see the exercise section). Exercise as much as your body can tolerate to improve and/or maintain muscle strength. (A preoperative exercise video is available online at HackensackMeridianHealth.org in the Orthopedic Services section.) SOCIAL SUPPORT 5 6Medication Management: Two (2) Weeks Prior to Your Surgery Stop Medications that Increase Bleeding Anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen (Motrin\u00ae, Advil\u00ae), naproxen (Aleve\u00ae, Naprosyn\u00ae), vitamin E, etc. may cause increased bleeding. Speak with your surgeon for instructions on what you can take for discomfort. If you are taking a blood thinner such any other blood thinning medication, speak with your surgeon and medical physician for instructions on stopping the medication. Stop Taking Herbal Medicines Herbal medicines can interfere with other medicines. Please stop taking any of your herbal medicines before surgery. Herbal medicines include, but are not limited to: echinacea, ginkgo, ginseng, ginger, licorice, feverfew, saw palmetto and kava-kava. Discuss all medicines that you are taking, whether prescribed, herbal or over-the-counter, with your surgeon. Take Medications as Instructed by Your Clinical Team You will be notified whether or not you should take any of your medications on the morning of surgery. It is common for heart, blood pressure, and thyroid medications to be taken leading up to, including and after the day of surgery. Preparing for Your Hospital Arrival What to Bring to the Hospital K Bring a list of your current medications (both prescribed and over-the-counter) and your prescription card. K Do not bring medications from home unless directed by your physician. Any medications brought to the hospital must be in their original prescription containers. K Bring 1 - 2 sets of loose-fitting, comfortable clothes such as sweatpants, shorts and t-shirts for therapy. K Bring comfortable, flat shoes that have an enclosed heel and toe, such as walking shoes or sneakers. Non-skid or rubber-soled shoes are preferred. K Bring personal hygiene toiletries and incontinence products. The hospital will provide basic toiletries. You may bring specific products from home if preferred. K Bring any special devices that you use at home, such as wrist splints, orthopedic shoes or devices, CPAP machine and settings. Do not bring any equipment such as a walker, as you will use the facility's equipment. K Bring your cellphone and charger. When to Arrive at the Hospital You will be contacted on the day prior to your surgery (or Friday evening for Monday surgery cases). You will be instructed regarding the time to report to the hospital prior to your surgery. When to Stop Eating and Drinking K Follow instructions given to you regarding when to stop eating or drinking before your surgery time. This includes gum, hard candy, water, soda, coffee, tea, beer, wine or other alcoholic beverages. K Brush your teeth, being careful not to swallow any water or toothpaste. E F G HE.

Long Arc Quad (Knee kicks) K Sit with your back against a chair, slowly extend your leg and straighten your knee. 7 8What to Expect in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU)/Recovery Room After surgery, you will be in the PACU, monitored by a certified registered nurse. K You may feel groggy. If you had spinal or epidural anesthesia, the numbness in both of your legs will slowly wear off. K The nurse will ask you to pump your feet up and down to make sure you have feeling in your legs and feet and to help with circulation. K You will begin your postoperative pain management regimen. K Once you are fully awake and stabilized, you will transition to the post-operative unit. You May Have the Following After Surgery K A drain that the surgeon places near your operative site to collect blood. K Oxygen may be used overnight. K A breathing exerciser (incentive spirometer) is used 10 times an hour, every hour you are awake. K Elastic/anti-embolism stockings may be worn daily to help prevent blood clots from forming in your legs. K Sequential compression devices (SCD) will be on your legs to help prevent blood clots (must always be worn at all times while in bed or recliner). K Cold therapy/ice will be applied to help prevent swelling and help reduce your pain. What Your Coach, Family Member or Friend Can Expect the Day of Your Surgery K Once you are brought into the operating room, our staff will guide family members and friends to the surgical lounge. K The surgeon will speak with family members or friends who are waiting at the completion of the operation. K If your family member or friend will not be waiting at the hospital, please provide the nursing staff with the name and phone number of the person whom your surgeon should call at the completion of the operation. K Family members and friends should take care of themselves while you are having surgery. They should be sure to get something to eat and drink. K Your belongings can be kept in the car until you have a room assignment. You will need those personal items before your family or friend departs for the day. Insurance Benefits Health care benefits change constantly. Therefore, it is important for you to review your insurance benefits and/or any alternative plans for payment before you come to the hospital. Find Out About Your Health Insurance Coverage No individual insurance program or combination - federal, state or private - covers all types of care and expenses. Prior to surgery, understand the limits of both your inpatient and post-hospital medical insurance and rehabilitation coverage. This will allow you to make informed decisions about your care, both while in the hospital and during recovery. Read the written information you have at home regarding your insurance coverage. If you have any questions, call the number on the back of your insurance card. Let the insurance representative know that you will be having surgery. The service representative will speak in general terms and will not know all the details about your surgery. (A list of questions you may want to ask your insurance representative is included in the back of this guidebook.) Qualifying for Benefits There is a difference between having a benefit and qualifying for a benefit. Qualifying for an insurance benefit is not a surgeon or primary care physician's decision. Your insurance company will determine your qualification for benefits based on its standards and policies. III. YOUR SURGICAL EXPERIENCE Our team is always available to answer any of your questions. Throughout your hospitalization, please inform the staff if we can do anything to help you have an outstanding hospital experience. Day of Your Surgery What to Expect in our Surgical Admitting Suite K You will change into a hospital gown. K Your health history and medication history will be reviewed by our nursing staff. K An intravenous (IV) line will be started to provide you with fluids and medications. K Your surgeon will visit you to identify your operative leg(s) and obtain surgical consent. K A member of our anesthesia team will visit you to discuss the anesthesia plan and treatment. What to Expect in the Operating Room Decisions regarding your anesthesia depend on your medical and surgical condition, and on your overall health. Regional and general are the types of anesthesia most often used for hip replacement surgery. There are two types of anesthesia: K Regional anesthesia involves the injection of a local anesthetic to provide numbness, loss of pain, or loss of sensation to a large region of the body. Regional anesthetic techniques include spinal blocks, epidural blocks and leg blocks. Medications are also given to make you drowsy and blur your memory. K General anesthesia provides loss of consciousness. Anesthesia will be administered by your anesthesiologist or a certified registered nurse anesthetist, who is responsible for your comfort and well-being during and immediately after your surgical procedure. WHAT TO EXPECT 9 10Pain Management and Integrative Health & Medicine Pain that is poorly controlled can interfere with recovery, sleep, appetite, activity, relationships and your emotional outlook. Your physicians, nurses and therapists have developed a multi-modal plan for you. Our pain management approach uses medications and non-narcotic treatments to help in your recovery. Pain is expected following joint replacement surgery, but together, we will be able to successfully manage the pain for active participation in your recovery. Ways You Can Help Us Manage Your Pain K Your therapists and nurses will ask you to rate your pain after activity, therapy and at rest. K Describe the type of pain, such as throbbing, shooting, aching, burning, or pressure. This will assist the clinical team in getting you the right type of pain control. K We will ask you to rate your pain on a scale of 0 to 10. A rating of 10 reflects the worst pain you could ever imagine, a rating of 5 means you feel a moderate amount of pain, and a 0 rating reflects no pain. Pain Medications (Pharmacological Use) There are many forms and types of medications used to treat pain. You may be on a combination with some taken orally (by mouth) and some through your intravenous (IV) line. Common side effects include nausea, itching, constipation, sedation and confusion. If you experience these side effects or any others, tell your health care professional right away. Integrative Health & Medicine Interventions (Non-narcotic Interventions) Integrative health and medicine focuses on the health and wellness of the whole person \u2014 mind, body and spirit. It addresses the impact of lifestyle, environment, and genetics on an individual's health and well-being, and understands that the provider/patient relationship is a vital component in the healing process. The goal is to empower the person to be an active participant in their health and to assist them with the tools they need to optimize their life. During your stay, a variety of integrative health modalities are available such as guided imagery, music channel, aromatherapy, acupressure, breathing and relaxation exercises. Please speak to your nurse to learn which integrative health modalities are offered at the hospital. Further information can be found in the resource section in the back of this guidebook. Patients who prefer opioid-free options to reduced use of narcotics for pain management may try the following: Post-Operative Unit Our nursing staff will monitor you regularly. During this time, we will check on your pain, comfort, bathroom, and personal needs. We will not wake you if you are sleeping, unless you or your physician has asked us to do so.0 No Pain Mild Pain Moderate Pain Severe Pain Worst Pain 1234567 8910 K Cold therapy/ice application K Deep breathing and guided imageryK Aromatherapy K Repositioning K Music channel K Hand massagesK Acupressure K Bring an iPod, book, magazine or hobby item to help you relax Immediately Following Your Surgery Early Mobilization Program K Early physical therapy and movement is as important as the operation itself for regaining function. The success of your rehabilitation depends on your participation. K Your physical therapist will evaluate you on the day of surgery, help you to stand and take a few steps. K Do not attempt to get up without assistance. PLEASE CALL our staff for assistance. You should review your total hip directions. Please see the postoperative section in this guidebook. Your Discharge Day K Prior to leaving the hospital, our team will review your discharge instructions including medications, physical therapy, home equipment, post-op surgeon appointment and home health services, if needed. Be sure to ask questions if you do not have a complete understanding of the instructions. GOING HOME 11 12Postoperative Care Post-Surgical Do's and Don'ts You may or may not have post-operative hip precautions. Your surgeon may have addressed this with you prior to surgery, but if not, you will receive specific instructions on any precautions post-operative by your physical therapist before discharge. Post-Operative Appointments with Your Surgeon You will require a post-operative appointment with your surgeon. Your care team will discuss this with you at the time of discharge. Caring for Yourself at Home When you go home, there are a variety of things you need to know for your safety, speedy recovery and comfort. Incision Care/Dressing Changes K Your incision should remain dry until seen at your post-operative visit (surgeon will give specific instructions on bathing). Do not put any creams on your incision unless otherwise directed by your physician. K Notify your physician if you experience an increase in redness, warmth, odor or excessive drainage at the incision site. Call your surgeon's office if you notice these changes. K Avoid touching your incision. K Wash your hands before and after changing your dressing. Elastic/Anti-Embolism Stockings K You may be required to wear special white stockings on both legs. These stockings are used to help compress the veins in your legs. This helps to keep swelling down and may reduce the occurrence of blood clots. K If swelling in the operative leg is bothersome, elevate the leg for short periods throughout the day. It is best to lie down and raise the leg above heart level. K Wear the stockings as instructed. K Do not roll your elastic stockings down to your knees. K Notify your physician if you notice increased pain or swelling in either leg. Pain Management K It is important to take pain medication with food and as prescribed by your surgeon. It may be helpful to take your pain medication about 30 minutes before your planned therapy/exercise session. K Don't wait until discomfort becomes severe to take medication. K Do not drink alcohol or drive while taking pain medication. As you have less discomfort, start to decrease how many pain pills you are taking and how often you are taking them. Eventually, you will no longer need pain medication. Applying an ice pack to your hip for 20 minutes several times per day can help the discomfort.IV. CARE TRANSITIONS Expectations of Discharge Your clinical team will identify the most appropriate setting and services to help with your recovery. Most of our patients get discharged directly to their home and start the next phase of recovery with either outpatient rehabilitation or home care. Our discharge planner (Care Management) will help you arrange for any necessary assistive equipment you may need. You will be expected to coordinate appropriate transportation as you will be unable to drive. Prior to surgery, it is important for you to make plans for support at home. Should you have more complex needs at the time of discharge, your surgeon, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, physical therapist and your insurance company will evaluate your progress and discuss with you whether or not a rehabilitation facility is recommended. Hackensack Meridian Health offers a full continuum of care and resources to help with your recovery. Physical Therapy and exercise are critical to your recovery. A physical therapist will continue to focus on improving your motion, strength and mobility. To avoid any gaps in rehabilitation, be sure to contact outpatient physical therapy to schedule your appointments. Outpatient Rehabilitation Our outpatient rehabilitation network offers a full array of rehabilitative and wellness therapies, treatments, and programs. Our goal is to restore your movement and function, relieve pain, and prevent further injury so you can lead an active and independent life. Your clinical team can provide a list of rehabilitation providers. Information is also available on HackensackMeridianHealth.org. Home Medical Equipment There is nothing like being in your own home when you are recovering from an illness or injury, but sometimes your recovery may be made easier with the assistance of medical or safety equipment like walkers, canes, crutches, commodes, and bath benches. Check with your insurance carrier to understand coverage available for this equipment. To learn about the many services offered by Hackensack Meridian At Home, call 1-800-655-2555.

To avoid this drink plenty of fluids and eat high-fiber foods (e.g. whole wheat grains or bread, high fiber cereals like Raisin Bran, vegetables, beans, prunes/prune juice, and dried fruit). Your doctor might recommend taking an over the counter stool softener or laxative if needed. If you do not have a bowel movement within 24 to 48 hours after discharge, contact your primary care physician. Activity K It is important to progress your activity as recommended by your physician and/or physical therapist. K RETURN TO DRIVING based on your surgeon's instruction. Resuming Intimacy K Resuming sexual relations after surgery may take several weeks. You must allow enough time for the incision and the muscles around the hip to heal. Discuss with your physician when you can resume these activities. K You may discuss when to resume sexual activity with your surgeon at your follow-up visit. You may also discuss the safe positions for sex without causing any injury to the hip. Sleeping Positions Finding a position that is both comfortable and safe is important during the early weeks following surgery for hip replacement. K Sleeping in a supine or back-lying position is recommended during the early postoperative period. K Sleeping on your stomach is not recommended. K Check with your surgeon for alternative sleeping positions. Call Your Surgeon Monitor and call your doctor if you experience the following: K Increased redness, heat, or swelling around incision. K Foul smelling drainage from incision. K Increased fluid draining from incision. K Increased pain in the hip. K Persistent fever greater than 101.5\u00b0 F, or chills, body aches. K Unusual pain or swelling in your calf muscle. K Chest pain or palpitations, or a new onset of heart burn. K Blood in urine, burning, or inability to urinate. K Sudden onset of severe pain, new pain, or limited movement in your joint. K Excessive bruising or bleeding of gums, nose, or after a bowel movement. This includes black tarry stools which could indicate coagulated blood. K If you have fallen, even if you feel the injury is minimal. K Slight confusion, excessive fatigue, severe headache, or lack of coordination. Contact your primary care doctor if you think you may have an infection elsewhere. This includes bladder, sinus, tooth, etc.Prevention of Complications Medication Compare your home list of medication with your discharge list of medication and be sure to ask any questions that you may have. Check to see if the dose or frequency has changed or if the medication has been discontinued. Avoiding Infection Hand washing (or an alcohol-based hand cleanser) is the most important step for preventing infection. You and your caregiver need to wash your hands prior to changing the dressing over your incision. Eating a healthy diet and drinking plenty of fluids can also help prevent infection. Anticoagulant Therapy Anticoagulant medication (e.g., aspirin) prevents blood clots from forming. The medication may be in pill or injection form (a tiny needle that goes into the abdomen). You may also need lab work done to make sure your medication is working properly. Take this medication for as long as directed by your doctor. Signs of Adverse Effects of Blood Thinners Blood thinners can cause bleeding if your blood becomes too thin. Call your doctor right away if any of these signs and symptoms is present. K Excessive bleeding from your surgical wound K Excessive bleeding from your gums while brushing your teeth K Frequent or severe bruising K Nosebleed for more than a few minutes or it does not stop with pressure K Dark or bloody urine K Bowel movements that look black, tarry or are bright red K Unusual bleeding Call your doctor if you sustain any falls or injuries while taking blood thinners. Signs of Blood Clots K A blood clot in the leg can travel to the lung. This can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing up blood, or unexplained anxiety, especially with breathing. K Call 911 for this medical emergency. To Help Prevent Blood Clots K Perform your exercises; don't forget your ankle pumps. K Walk several times a day. K Wear your compression stockings if ordered. K Take your anticoagulants (blood thinners) as directed. 15 16You will regain your strength and endurance as you begin to do your normal daily routine. The more you are active and exercise, the more mobile you will become. Feeling tired and becoming easily fatigued is very normal after joint replacement surgery. Whether you have reached all the recommended goals in three months or not, you need to have a regular exercise program to maintain the fitness and the health of the muscles around the joints. With both your orthopedic and primary care physician's permission, you should be on a regular exercise program three to four times per week lasting 20 to 30 minutes. An ideal body weight puts the least amount of stress on your new hip. A dietitian can make suggestions for a healthy weight loss meal plan. Talk to your primary nurse if you would like to see a dietician during your inpatient hospital stay or review your wellness resource list provided at discharge.

RESOURCES Advance Directives Put Your Health Care Decisions in Writing The State of New Jersey, the hospitals within the Hackensack Meridian Health network, and the professionals who provide your care consider health care planning very important. For that reason, every patient is asked about and encouraged to prepare an advance directive. This allows a patient to place their wishes and individual considerations at the forefront of their care so the medical team can respect and uphold those wishes. Under New Jersey Law, there are three kinds of advance directives. K Proxy Directive: appoints a person (health care representative) and an alternate representative to make health care decisions when you are not able to do so. This is sometimes called a health care proxy or a health care power of attorney; K Instruction Directive: states your treatment wishes and/or instructions. This is sometimes called a living will. K Combined Directive: appoints a health care representative and states your treatment instructions. An advance directive goes into effect when you are temporarily or permanently unable to make health care decisions. If and/or when you regain decision-making ability, you will resume making your own health care decisions. In the absence of an advance directive, your next-of-kin has the legal authority to make health care decisions for you (spouse, oldest adult child, etc.). There is no specific form that must be followed in New Jersey and you do not need a lawyer to prepare an advance directive. In fact, the document is considered legal if it is witnessed by two adults (not named as a health care representative or alternate) or notarized. At Hackensack Meridian Health, health care professionals (with the exception of your attending physician) can serve as witnesses. For more information or to request a form or assistance with completing an advance directive, speak with your nurse.

Integrative medicine research shows that therapeutic-grade essential oils have chemical properties that can reduce pain, nausea, and anxiety and improve sleep. How does Aromatherapy work? Inhaling an essential oil is a quick way to experience its benefits. Once inhaled, the fragrance enters through the nasal passage and travels to the olfactory bulb. The fragrance is sent to the center of the brain where it is processed and neurochemicals are released. Depending on the inhaled essential oil, these can be relaxing, stimulating or sedating. In the inpatient setting, we are currently offering five different inhalers available to patients, as a complementary therapy for symptom management. Your nurse will teach you how to use the aromatherapy inhaler.

Pericardium 6 (P6) Acupressure Point Step 1: Find the point, three finger widths from base of wrist. Step 2: Now feel the center of the two tendons with the index finger. Apply pressure with your pointer finger. It is common to feel a dull aching sensation at the point. Stimulate this point with moderate to firm pressure with your fingertips in a circular motion and repeat the movement on each wrist for at least 30 seconds and up to 2 minutes. The treatment can be used as often as needed. Once you know the location of the point, some people find it is easier to use their thumb to apply the pressure. Make sure to ask your health care provider exactly how to use these mind-body techniques.
