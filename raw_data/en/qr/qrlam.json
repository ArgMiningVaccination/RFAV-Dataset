COVID -19 is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS -CoV-2. WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID- 19) Dashboard | WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID -19) Dashboard ) reports on the number of cases and deaths globally and per country. As of 27 February 2021, there have been, globally, 113, 076,707 confirmed cases of COVID -19, including 2 ,512,272 deaths. In Switzerland, epidemiological data on COVID -19 are collected by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (BAG, Bundesamt f\u00fcr Gesundheitswesen), Situation in Switzerland (admin.ch) and (BAG_COVID -19_Woechentliche_Lage.pdf ). Cumulatively and up to February 21, 2021, there have been 550, 066 confirmed cases of COVID -19 (6, 391.6 per 100 ,000 inhabitants), 23,617 hospitali sations (274.4 per 100 ,000 inhabitants) and 9, 204 deaths (106.9 per 100 ,000 inhabitants). While hospitali sations occur in every age group, more than 80% of hospitali sations in Switzerland are in people aged 50 and over, with incidence increasing with age. Underlying health conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular di sease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, immuno compromised status, cancer and obesity are considered risk factors for the development of severe COVID -19. Symptoms may appear 2 -14 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may include: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea. Severe COVID -19 can cause dyspnoea, pneumonia and ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), thromboembolism and other conditions that may require ICU care. In addition to respiratory sequelae, severe COVID -19 has been linked to cardiovascular and renal sequelae and neurological complications . Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks. 4 Quality Aspects 4.1 Drug Substance Drug Substance BNT162b2 (tozinameran), the active substance of Comirnaty, is a 5' -capped mRNA encoding the the SARS- CoV-2 virus. The S1S2 protein sequence includes an intrinsic signal peptide at the N-terminal end and two proline point mutations resulting in the protein in the optimi sed prefusion conformation. The RNA sequence contains common structural elements, such as 5'cap, 5' and 3' UTRs, poly(A) tail. Uridine in the sequence is replaced by N -methyl pseudouridine. The mRNA drug substance is formulated with lipid nanoparticles for the protection of mRNA after administ ration and to facilitate transfection into the host cells. Upon uptake, mRNA is released and translated in the cell to generate the encoded S1S2 protein antigen. The d rug substance is manufactured in a cell-free system by an in vitro transcription reacti on using enzymatic reagents and utili 5'-cap structure and lineari sed plasmid template as starting materials. The in vitro transcription reaction is followed by several purification and filtration steps. The purified drug substance is filled into the primary containers and frozen. Lineari sed plasmid is not a structural component of the drug substance but serves as a template for the respective enzyme, thus defining the correct nucleotide sequence of the mRNA drug substance. Plasmid is produced by fermentation in established and characteri sed bacterial cell banks. For plasmid manufacture and control, sufficient information was provided.

The 3' -tail. codons and uridine is replaced by N1- methyl -pseudouridine to allow efficient translation in human cells. The vaccine is formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP s), which are composed of 4 lipids: ALC - 0315, ALC -0159, DSPC, and cholesterol. Other in the NaCl, KCL, Na 2HPO 4, and KH 2PO 4. The drug product is a preservative- free, sterile dispersion of RNA formulated in LNP s in an aqueous cryoprotectant buffer for intramuscular (IM) administration. For more details, see above (Quality Aspects). In cell culture it was shown that , after uptake of the modRNA, the S protein is localised in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and on the surface of cells in the plasma membrane. Ultrastructural analyses confirmed the prefusion conformation in 20.5% of the trimeric S protein. Animal studies were performed in mice and non -human primates (NHP s). In mice , the immunogenicity of BNT162b2 was evaluated after sing le IM injections of 0.2, 1 and 5 \u00b5 g of lipid - formulated modRNA/animal. BNT162b2 induced a humoral immune response characterised by a induction of S protein- specific IgG1 and IgG2 immunoglobulins binding to important S protein domains such as the S 1 and the ACE2 receptor -binding domain. Neutralising immunoglobulins were induced in a BNT162b2 -dose manner as measured by an S VSV virus -based neutralisation assay. to a BNT162b2 -mediated Th1 immune response. The Th1 immune response was further characterised by an induction of Th1- specific cytokines in splenocytes such as INF and IL- 2, but not Th2 -specific cytokines such as IL- 4, IL-5 and IL INF was secreted by CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells. In all analysed compartments of the immune system, BNT162b2 application mediated the increase and activation of Tfh cells, a T- cell typ e supporting B cell responses. No prime -boost regimen was applied, no old animals were tested, and no long -term immunity data were generated in mice. An NHP prime -boost study with i.m. injection s of 30 or 100 \u00b5 g BNT162b2 on study days 0 and 21 was perfor med in adult animals. No old animals were studied, and no long- term study was performed to assess long -term immunity. The prime- boost regimen induced an IgG humoral response with neutralising antibody titres of similar or higher range as compared to human convalescent plasma. Three weeks after boost, there was a trend showing a reduction in the neutralising antibody titres. The available data with respect to the cell -mediated immunity point to a Th1 response as measured by a strong induction of INF and only a low induction of IL- 4. No analysis was performed regarding the innate immune responses. An NHP challenge study was performed after prime- boost vaccination with BNT162b2 and animals infected with 10 6 PFU of the SARS- CoV-2 strain USA -WA1/2020. M acaques are a model for viral infection, but not a model for virus -induced pathogenicity, as animals show no clear signs of illness after challenge SARS -CoV-2. Furthermore, the immune response of non -vaccinated animals against the challenge virus reduces t he viral load by day 6. Therefore, only a short time window of 3 to 6 days can be used to show differences between vaccinated and non- vaccinated animals. A fter prime -boost vaccination, the viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), nasal and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs was reduced as compared to controls. The maximum viral load in controls was determined three days after infection. No studies with respect to safety pharmacology were conducted, which can be accepted based on the absence of safety signals from GLP toxicity studies.

Detailed ADME studies are not usually required for vaccines by international agreement , and the lack of these data is acceptable due to the nature of the mRNA -LNP product. The metabolism of the modRNA was not investigated. It is estimated that the mRNA is degraded within the target cells within hours to a few days. From the four l ipid compounds, ALC-0315 and ALC- 0159 were assessed. The other two lipids (distearoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol) are natural lipids that are metabolised in the same way as the endogenous counterparts. Following intravenous injection, plasma concentra tions of ALC -0315 and ALC -0159 decreased rapidly, with an initial T 12 of 1.6 and 1.7 hours, respectively. ALC -0315 and ALC -0159 were then cleared from plasma, resulting in a terminal elimination t 12 of 139 and 72.7 hours , respectively. ALC-0315 and ALC -0159 were stable for two hours in liver microsomes, S9 fractions and after incubation for four hours with hepatocytes. When incubated for longer time points in blood, liver S9 and liver hepatocytes, ALC -0315 was hydrolysed by de- esterification. The estimate d percent of dose distributed to the liver was ~60% for ALC -0315 and ~20% for ALC -0159. The percent of dose excreted unchanged in f aeces was ~1% for ALC -0315 and ~50% for ALC -0159. The biodistribution of lipid -mRNA particles was assessed in mice using various LNP -formulated modRNA s encoding luciferase. After IM injection, luciferase activity was monitored in vivo for 9 days. The highest signals were detected at the injection site and, 6 hours after inj ection, in the liver. The activation of the innate immune system was also determined in the same studies in mice with the mRNA -LNP encoding luciferase by measuring several chemokines/cytokines. The mRNA -LNP injection resulted in a transient induction of IL -6, MCP -1 and IP -10, indicating of macrophages. intramuscular administration of radiolabelled mRNA -LNP in rats , the highest concentration was found at the injection site. Outside the injection site, low levels of radioactivity were detected in most tissues, with the highest levels in the liver. Toxicity The toxicity of BNT162b2 was assessed in rats , with three weekly IM injections at dose levels of 30 or 100 g and a recovery phase of three weeks. There were no vaccine- related mortalities or gross clinical signs. Clinical findings included slightly reduced body weights and body weight gain and elevations in body temperatures. There were no changes in food intake. There were no vaccine- related ophthalmologic or auditory alterations. None of the animals of any treatment group revealed any systemic changes in behaviour, external appearance, or consistency of faeces. Local reactions included thickening at injection sites , with reversible erythema and oedema development. The reactions were stronger after the second and third injections and resolved prior to the subsequent dosing. Microscopic findings confirmed a local inflammatory reaction associated with mixed mononuclear cell infiltration, variable fibrosis, myofib re degeneration and inflammation of the perineural tissue of the sciatic nerve, increased cellularity of germinal centres and increased plasma cells in the draining lymph nodes, increased cellularity of ha ematopoietic cells and germinal centres of the spleen and increased cellularity of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. In addition, reversible vaccine- related vacuolation of periportal hepatocytes was observed in the liver, with no evidence of liver injury. Liver enzymes (AST, ALP) were increased in vaccinated animals. Macroscopic analyses revealed the local injection reactions (abnormal colour, abnormal consistency) transient enlargeme nts of draining lymph nodes associated with inflammation and enlarged spleens with increased haematopoiesis. Haematological observations were reversible and included a transient reduction in reticulocytes, minimal decreases in RBC, HGB, HCT, sporadic small -magnitude decreases in platelets, increases in white blood cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes and large unstained cells) and changes in acute phase markers (higher alpha- 1 acid glycoprotein and alpha- 2- 3012 www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 macroglobulin and fibrinogen and l ower albumin). In addition, a higher red cell distribution width, higher globulin levels, and a lower albumin:globulin ratio were observed. With the exception of the microscopic injection site reaction , all findings were reversible. Administration of thre e once -weekly doses of BNT162b2 elicited SARS -CoV-2 neutrali sing antibody responses at the end of the dosing and recovery phases of the study. No genotoxicity studies were performed. Based on the current scientific findings, and by international agreement , this can be accepted, as neither the mRNA nor the lipids are expected to have a genotoxic potential. The developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) was evaluated in rats by IM injection of BNT162b2 (30 \u00b5g/dose) in female rats 21 and 14 days before m ating and on gestation days 9 and 20. Neutralising antibodies were measurable in female animals and in foetuses. There were no adverse effects on mating performance or fertility in F0 female rats or on embryo- foetal or postnatal survival, growth, or the development of the F1 offspring. It is not known whether the vaccine can be transferred via placental transfer or with the milk during lactation. Nonclinical benefit risk assessment In nonclinical studies, BNT162b2 showed humoral and cellular immune stimulation towards a Th1 response. The vaccine induces neutralising antibodies that are able to control SARS- CoV-2 amplification. Based on the pharmacokinetics, it can be assumed that mos t of the BNT162b2 stays locally at the injection site. Outside the injection site, low levels of radioactivity were detected in most tissues, with the highest levels in the liver. This systemic distribution might be favourable for the immune response. On t he other hand, it also poses a risk with respect to the development of unpredictable adverse events. The toxicity profile is acceptable. All local effects show a reversible tendency , and systemic effects are fully reversible within three weeks after the vaccine administration. Considering the totality of data, it can be concluded that , in the light of the current pandemic, the benefit of the vaccine outweighs the risk. The BNT162b2 vaccine can be approved from the preclinical perspective.

Mechanism of Action The nucleoside- modified messenger RNA in the vaccine is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the RNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARS -CoV-2 S antigen. The vaccine elicits both neutrali sing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen. Immunogenicity Immunogenicity data are available from two studies: the phase 1 study BNT162- 01 (First in Human, FIH), conducted in Germany since April 2020, and phase 1 of the phase 1/2/3 study C4591001, started shortly afterwards in the USA . Both studies are still ongoi ng. In both studies phase 1 was designed to choose the optimal vaccine candidate and an appropriate dose and schedule for phase 2/3 of study C4591001, which is the pivotal efficacy and safety study. For both phase 1 studies, immunogenicity data are avai lable for up to 1 month after the second dose. STUDY BNT -162-01 Study BNT162- 01 is a multi -site, dose- escalation trial, initially investigating the safety and immunogenicity of four prophylactic SARS -CoV-2 RNA vaccines. Healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age all received active vaccine. The protocol was later amended to allow inclusion of older adult participants up to 85 years of age. By the time Comirnaty\u00ae had received its temporary authorisation by Swissmedic, safety and immunogenicity data were available for up to 28 days after dose t wo in adults 18 to 55 years of age. The study is ongoing, and subjects will be followed for immunogenicity and safety for up to 162 days post -dose two. This will include adults aged 56 to 85 y ears. The final two vaccine candidates were BNT162b1 and BNT162 b2, and BNT162b2 was ultimately chosen, based on the overall humoral and cellular response as well as the reactogenicity profile (see sections 6.2 and 6.4). The results for the final vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, are presented here. The dose levels tested for BNT162b2 were as follows: 1 g, 3 g, 10 g, 20 g, 30 g (at the time of interim study report preparation, data for the dose levels of 50 g and 60 g were not available). Dosage frequency: Two injections about 21 days apart. 12 subjects were planned for each dose level. The humoral immune response in healthy adults after dose 1 only or after both doses 1 and 2 was tested primarily by looking at functional antibody responses, fold increase in functional antibody GMTs, and the number of participants with seroconversion, defined as a minimum of a 4-fold i ncrease in functional antibody GMTs compared to baseline. The cell-mediated immunity ( CMI) responses (induced SARS -CoV-2 specific responses, of IMP -induced SARS -CoV-2 specific T -cells as assessed by ICS) were also tested. Key humoral and cellular immunity results are summarised below. Humoral Immunity Fold increase from baseline in functional 50% SARS -CoV-2 neutrali sing antibody titres (VN 50) - IMM Immunogenicity set; 50% SARS -CoV-2 3012 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Geometric means fold increase (GMFI) from baseline in VN50 titre with 95% confidence intervals are shown for BNT162b2 dose levels. Arrowheads indicate baseline (dose 1, Day 1) and dose 2 (Day 22). The dotted horizontal line represents the threshold for seroconversion (fold increase 4). One can see that on Day 29 (= 7 days after the second dose of BNT162b2), virus neutrali sing GMTs were highest for the 30 g dose level, although by day 43 they had diminished somewhat and were similar to the 10 \u00b5g level. Day 43 virus neutrali sing GMTs were 0.3- fold (1 g dose) to 1.7 -fold (30 g dose) those of a COVID - 19 human convalescent sera (HCS) panel com prised of 38 human COVID -19 HCS. This panel included individuals aged 18 to 83 y ears, at least 14 days after confirmed diagnosis (symptomatic disease for 35 of the 38 sera obt ained at a time when the individuals were asymptomatic). This confirmed that the 30 g dose of BNT162b2 induces virus neutrali sing GMTs which are, on average, higher than those induced by a natural infection. Frequency of subjects with SARS -CoV-2 GMT ser oconversion: BNT162b2 IMM Seroconversion is defined as a minimum of 4- fold increase in functional antibody response compared to baseline. The frequency of younger adults aged 18 to 55 years with seroconversion is displayed below: GMT = geometric mean titre ; IMM = Immunogenicity set. Note: At the cut -off date for this report, only limited data for the 20 g dose level were available (7 sera evaluable for Day 29, 4 sera evaluable for Day 15 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 In summary, at least for the 10 g and 30 g doses, partici pants vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2 showed both neutralising antibody titres that were higher than human convalescent sera and at least a 4 -fold increase in functional antibody response compared to baseline. In the absence of known correlates of protection against SARS -CoV-2, this was deemed acceptable by both the company and by Swissmedic. Cellular Immunity SARS -CoV-2-specific CD4+ and C CD8+ T -cell response data (ELISpot data) were available from 39 participants dosed with 1, 3, 10, 20, or 30 g BNT162b2. BNT162b2 induced strong SARS -CoV-2 S protein -specific CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell responses in all , or almost all , the dosed participants (39 of 39 [100%] and 35 of 39 [89.7%]), respectively. These T- cell responses were directed against different parts of the antigen, including epitopes in the RBD, indicating the induction of multi -epitopic responses by B NT162b2. Dosing twice with BNT162b2 led to a substantial increase in incidence and magnitude of T -cell responses, especially for dose levels of 10 g or higher. Functional and pro- inflammatory CD4+/CD8+ T -cell responses, including Th1 (IFN and IL- 2) an d Th2 (IL -4) cytokine profile of T -cells specific to S or RBD of SARS -CoV-2 were assessed by ICS. De novo induction of SARS -CoV-2 S or RBD protein directed T- cells was confirmed. INF -producing CD4 and CD8 T -cells against SARS -CoV-2 S or RBD were not detected at baseline in participants and were induced robustly by BNT162b2. No clear dose dependency was observed. The results confirm that the Th1 response is greater than the Th2 response. Th1 / Th2 > 1 is desired, because a Th2 response may be associated with vaccine- associated enhanced respiratory disease. The data presented in this first -in-human study were obtained from healthy younger adults (aged between 18 and 55 years). Adults aged between 56 and 85 years of age have already been enrolled in the study , but the results will b e reported at a later date , in any case before a full marketing authorisation is granted. Follow -up data up to six months will be available for both age groups. PHASE 1/2/3 STUDY C4591001 Study C4591001 is a Phase 1/2 /3, Placebo- Controlled, Randomis ed, Observer -Blind, Dose -Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity, and Efficacy of SARS -COV -2 RNA Vaccine. This study is also ongoing. Subject First Visit: 29 April 2020 Data Cut -off dates: 24 August 2020 (Phase 1 safety and immunogenicity data through 1 month after Dose 2) 02 September 2020 (Phase 2 safety data 7 days after Dose 2 only) 06 October 2020 (Phase 2/3 safety data 1 month after Dose 2 for the first 6610 participants, and available safety data for all 36,855 participants) 04 November 2020 (Phase 2/3 first interim analysis for efficacy at 94 cases) 14 November 2020 (Phase 2/3 final analysis for efficacy at 178 cases, safety data 1 month after Dose 2 for 37,586 participants with a median of at least 2 months of follow -up, and available safety data for all 43,252 participants). Study C4591001 was started as a Phase 1/2 study in adults in the US, and was subsequently expanded into a global Phase 2/3 study. 44,822 subjects were enrolled, and 43,386 subjects were SwissPAR 16 29 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 randomised at 153 centres in 6 countries worldwide, including: United States (131 centres, 33,068 subjects), Argentina (1 site, 5,776 s ubjects), Brazil (2 sites, 2,900 subjects), Turkey (9 sites, 342 subjects), South Africa (4 sites, 800 subjects) and Germany (6 sites, 500 subjects). The study was also later amended to include older adolescents 16 to 17 years of age, then later amended t o include younger adolescents 12 to 15 years of age. For the current, temporary authoris ation, only participants 16 and over were considered in the interim and final (primary efficacy endpoint) interim analyses. A last protocol amendment, dated 01 December 2020, was submitted by the company around the time that Swissmedic granted a temporary authorisation for Comirnaty\u00ae. The reason for the amendment was that , after emergency and/or temporary authorisations were granted in countries with study centres, it would no longer be feasible to keep all participants in the study. The amendment added the possibility of administering BNT162b2 to participants who originally received placebo, following completion of an active blinded safety surveillance period of maximu m 6 months after dose two. A final study report from study C4591001 is planned for 2023. Phase 1 Immunogenicity Endpoints In Phase 1, two age groups were studied separately, younger participants (18 to 55 years of age) and older participants (65 to 85 y ears of age). The study population included healthy male and female participants. The immunogenicity objectives were to describe the immune response in healthy adults after dose 1 only or after both doses 1 and 2 (two injections about 21 days apart). The doses tested were 10, 20 and 30 micrograms for both age groups. For each dose group of 12 participants receiving one of the two vaccine candidates, three additional participants received a placebo vaccine (randomisation ratio of 4:1). The p lacebo consisted of normal saline. Humoral immunogenicity was assessed at Day 1 (before Dose 1) and 7 days after Dose 1 , at Day 21 (before Dose 2) and 7 days, 14 days, and 1 month after Dose 2. Data were summarised for each dose level and age group. BNT162b2 SARS- CoV-2 Neutrali sing Titres In the younger age group, SARS -CoV-2 50% neutrali sing GMTs increased by Day 21 after Dose 1 and were substantially increased 7 days after Dose 2 (Day 28) of BNT162b2. Similar trends were generally observed in the older age gr oup, with higher GMTs observed in the 30 g dose groups compared to the 20 g and 10 g dose groups. In the older age group, SARS -CoV-2 50% neutrali sing GMTs were generally lower than the GMTs in the younger age group. Phase 2 Immunogenicity Endpoints The phase 2 part of the study was comprised of the first 360 participants enrolled (1:1 randomi sation between BNT162b2 and placebo, stratified by age groups [18 to 55 years and >55 to 85 years] with approximately 50% in each age stratum) , and was designed to assess safety data through 7 days after d ose 2 and immunogenic ity data through 1 month after dose 2. In Phase 2, immunogenicity was assessed at Day 1 (before dose 1) and 1 month after dose 2. Immunogenicity results from the 360 participants in Phase 2 of the study demonstrated that BNT162b2 at 30 \u00b5g elicited SARS -CoV-2 neutrali sation and S1 -binding IgG antibody responses at 1 month after dose 2 similar to those previously observed in phase 1 of the study. Notably, SARS - CoV-2 neutrali sing titres were hi gher in the younger age cohort compared with the older age cohort. SwissPAR 17 / 29 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 S1-binding GMCs were generally also higher in the younger age cohort compared to the older age cohort, again concordant with observations in the Phase 1 portion of the study. Phase 3 Immu nogenicity Endpoints In the phase 3 part of the study, immunogenicity is a secondary (12 to 15- year-olds compared with 16 to 25- year-olds) and exploratory endpoint. These data will be reported by the company at a later date and were not included in the interim study report . Further evaluation of immunogenicity is scheduled for months 6, 12 and 24 following dose 2. The exploratory immunogenicity assessments are therefore planned at time points up to 24 months. One of the planned exploratory endpoints includes the description of the serological responses to the BNT vaccine candidate in cases of: Confirmed COVID -19 Confirmed severe COVID -19 SARS- CoV-2 infection without confirmed COVID -19 This might help in the determination of correlates of protection. Immune responses induced by the vaccine against emerging circulating strains of SARS -CoV- 2 will also be investigated. Effectiveness studies included in the RMP will be important to understand the performance of the vacci ne in case of e.g. mutating variants. Efficient neutrali sation of spike protein mutants from study breadth of vaccine- elicite d polyclonal antibodies. It may be important to consider this aspect when facing emerging variants with mutations in the spike proteins, e.g. the UK variant, as the vaccine might still be able to confer sufficient cross -neutralisation. 6.2 Dose Finding and Do se Recommendation The choice and dose of vaccine candidate were based on the results of the two clinical phase 1 trials presented above (study BNT -162-01 and phase 1 of study C4591001) and took into account safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity. For safety data see section 6.4 below. Choice of Vaccine C andidate The neutralising antibody responses between the two vaccine candidates were considered similar. For both BNT162b1 and BNT162b2, the S1- and RBD comparable the kinetics of neutrali sing antibodies, with lower IgG concentrations in the older age group than in the younger age group. For the 30 g dose cohort vaccinated with BNT162b2, however, CD4 and CD8 cytokine responses showed the same intensity in adults and older adults, whereas for the 30 g dose cohort vaccinated with BNT1 62b1, RBD -specific IL -2-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were reduced in older adults. Also in older adults, the vaccine candidate BNT162b2 had a reactogenicity profile in clinical trials that seemed more favourable than that observed with BNT162b1 (see section 6.4). Thus, BNT162b2 was eventually chosen over BNT162b1 to proceed to the phase 2 and 3 parts of study C4591001 as it provided the optimum combination of a favourable reactogenicity profile and a robust immune response likely to afford protection against COVID -19 in younger and older adults. Benefits of Second D ose The immune responses in terms of neutrali sing antibody responses clearly demonstrated that two doses resulted in increased geometric mean titres (GMTs) compared to responses after only the first SwissPAR 18 / 29 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 dose. Thus, in the absence of a serological correlate of protection, these data supported the need for two doses in adults. The responses to the vaccines w ere higher compared to a pool of human convalescent sera in study BNT162- 001. Choice of the 30 g Dose Level The S1 - and RBD -binding IgG kinetics were comparable with the kinetics of neutrali sing antibodies, with lower IgG concentrations in the older age group than in the younger age group. The responses were numerically higher in higher dose groups compared to lower doses but did not substantially differ between 10 ug and 30 ug. However, S1 -IgG antibody -binding concentrations after BNT162b2 favoured the s election of the 30 g dose level. When selecting the dose level for Phase 2/3, the major driver was the need to maximi se SARS -CoV-2 neutrali sing antibody responses in the older age group, who are at the highest risk of severe disease. 6.3 Efficacy Pivotal S tudy C4591001: Phase 2/3 of the 1/2/3 Study The phase 2/3 evaluation part of pivotal Study C4591001 phases 1/2/3 started on 27 July 2020, using BNT162b2 at the 30 g dose level. The 360 phase 2 participants are included in the efficacy evaluation of the phase 2/3 study. Phases 2 and 3 of study C4591001 constituted the pivotal efficacy and safety study. It was a placebo- controlled, randomis ed, observer -blind1, event -based study. Two interim efficacy analyses were carried out once a certain number of symptomatic and PCR positive COVID -19 cases had occurred in the study (event -based study). First Interim Analysis for Efficacy The first interim analysis was based on 94 total cases of COVID -19 occurring at least seven days after the second dose. The cut -off date was 04 November 2020. This first interim analysis met the minimal statistical analysis plan requirements for vaccine efficacy, and, with the final interim analysis (see below), the minimal median safety follow -up of two months following the second dose was also met. Among participants included in the evaluable efficacy population, 32,279 participants (16,061 in the BNT162b2 group and 16,218 in the placebo group) did not have evidence of infection with SARS - CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. From that point in time onward, 4 COVID -19 cases were reported in the BNT162b2 group compared to 90 COVID -19 cases reported in the placebo group. These data give an estimated vaccine eff icacy of 95.5% for BNT162b2. Final Interim Analysis for Efficacy On 09 December 2020, the company submitted a final interim efficacy report dated 03 December 2020, with a data cut -off date of 14 November 2020. This \"Final Analysis Interim Report\" was bas ed on 178 cases of COVID -19 (169 in the placebo group and 9 in the vaccine group) occurring at least 7 days after the second dose. 44,822 subjects had been enrolled and 43,386 subjects had been randomised at 153 centres, in 6 countries worldwide, including: United States (131 centres, 33,068 subjects), Argentina (1 site, 5,776 subjects), Brazil (2 sites, 2,900 subjects), Turkey (9 sites, 342 subjects), South Africa (4 sites, 800 subjects) and Germany (6 sites, 500 subjects). The evaluable efficacy populati on included all eligible randomised participants who received all vaccinations as randomis ed, with Dose 2 received 1 The study is observer -blinded, as the physical appearance of the investigational vaccine candidates and the placebo may differ. The participant, investigator, study coordinator, and other site staff are blinded.

This was the primary analysis population for all efficacy analyses. Additional analyses based on the all -available efficacy populations, including all randomis ed participants who completed one and two vaccination doses respectively, were also performed. There were two parts to the primary efficacy endpoint: First primary efficacy endpoint : To evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic BNT162b2 against confirmed COVID -19 occurring from 7 days after the second dose in participants without evidence of infection before vaccination. Second primary efficacy endpoint: To evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic BNT162b2 against confirmed COVID -19 occurring from 7 days after the second dose in participants with and without evidence of SARS- CoV-2 infection before vaccination. First primary efficacy endpoint: The f irst primary efficacy endpoint included 18 ,198 vaccine group and 18, 325 placebo group subjects. In the first primary analysis, the efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine from 7 days after Dose 2 was measured in participants without evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV-2. The results showed a 95.0% (95% confidence interval of 90.0% to 97.9%) vaccine efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older. Demographics table (population for the first primary efficacy endpoint) a a.

This explains the very large confidence intervals around the efficacy results and therefore the uncertainty of the results in persons over 75 years of age (see table below) .

Vaccine Efficacy - First Severe COVID -19 Occurrence From 7 Days After Dose 2 - Subjects Without Evidence of Infection Prior to 7 Days After Dose 2 - Evaluable Efficacy (7 Days) Population SwissPAR 22 / 29 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 As the number of cases was very low, only numerical trends can be seen. As defined in the protocol (cases occurring after day 7 following dose two ), a secondary endpoint, there were 3 cases in the placebo group and 1 case in the vaccine group. This corresponds to a 66.4% vaccine efficacy (95% confidence interval of -124.8; 96.3). The power of the study did not allow for a statistically significant result. Counting all severe COVID -19 cases occurring after dose 1 (thus including the 4 cases mentioned in the previous paragraph) , there was a total of one case in the vaccine group and 9 cases in the placebo group. All confirmed cases of COVID -19 after dose 1 An analysis of the cases occurring from dose 1 and until dose 2 or 1 week after dose 2 provides information on the onset of protection. The table below lists all reports of COVID -19 with onset at any time after Dose 1 (all participants in the all-availabl e efficacy population, regardless of evidence of infection before or during the vaccination regimen). Among these participants, 50 cases of COVID -19 occurred after Dose 1 in the BNT162b2 group compared to 275 cases in the placebo group. Notably, in the BN T162b2 group, most cases occurred before Dose 2. SwissPAR 23 / 29 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Vaccine Efficacy - First COVID -19 Occurrence After Dose 1 - Dose 1 All - Available Efficacy Population The table above shows that the first dose offers partial protection, especially starting 14 days after dose one. However, maxim um protection only occurs after 7 days have elapsed following dose 2. S ince maxim um immunogenicity is seen after dose two, the duration of the immunogenicity observed after dose one may be shorter than that observed after dose two. It is also important to note that , even though the efficacy analyses included participants who received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination, the majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after the first dose. Duration of follow -up The primary analysis of efficacy was conducted when the pre- defined number of 164 COVID -19 cases had occurred. This corresponds to about 1.5 months of median follow -up time after completion of the full vaccination regimen. Therefore, available efficacy data are limited in terms of follow -up duration, and the efficacy of the vaccine over longer periods remains unknown. Data are expected to become available post -authorisation. 6.4 Safety Overall Safety Database For safety, the median follow -up time was two months after dose two (phase 2/3 of study C4591001). At the cut -off date of 14 November 2020, the longest follow -up time available was 12- 13 weeks after Dose 2 (N=780: N=382 BNT162b2 and N=398 placebo). Overall, study C4591001 enrolled Phase 2/3 participants (N=43,448) that received at least one dose of BN T162b2 (N=21,720) or placebo (N=21,728), regardless of the duration of follow -up. The safety database consisted of: Study BNT162- 01 (N=60 any Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Phase 1 of study C4591001 (N=72 any dose of BNT162b2; N=12 B NT162b2 30 \u00b5g; placebo N=18). Phase 2/3 participants with a follow -up 2 months after Dose 2 (N=19,037) of either BNT162b2 (N=9531) or placebo (N=9536). All enrolled Phase 2/3 participants (N=43,448) that received at least one dose of BNT162b2 (N=21,720) or placebo (N=21,728), regardless of the duration of follow -up. Phase 2/3 participants (N=37,706) randomised before 9 October 2020 who received BNT162b2 (N=18,860) or placebo (N=18,846). These subjects had a median follow -up time of 2 months after Dose 2 (at least 1 month after dose 2). Of these, 1,148 subjects had a positive SARS- CoV-2 baseline status (vaccinated N=558; placebo N=590). Reactogenicity was evaluated based on a subset of subjects in the Phase 2/3 study, i.e. 8,183 (N=4,093 BNT162b2; N=4,090 placebo), who reported on local reactions, systemic events, and antipyretic/pain medication usage for 7 days after each dose in an e-diary. Adverse Events The adverse event (AE) profile did not suggest any serious safety concerns. The incidence of se rious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths occurring during the study were low and similar between the two groups. There were two deaths in the BNT162b2 group and four in the placebo group, none due to COVID -19 or to the study intervention. The incidence of di scontinuations due to AEs was similar between the BNT162b2 and the placebo groups. At the time of the analysis of Study C4591001, a total of 19,067 (9,531 Comirnaty and 9,536 placebo) participants 16 years of age or older were evaluated for safety for at least 2 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. This included a total of 10,727 (5,350 Comirnaty and 5,377 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 8,340 (4,181 Comirnaty and 4,159 placebo) participants 56 years and older. The most frequent adverse reactions were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia and chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%). Other reactogenicity events included pain in extremity, injection s ite redness, malaise, injection site pruritus, lymphadenopathy, insomnia, and nausea. All reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The frequenc ies of headache, fatigue and fever were higher after Dose 2 in both age groups. Four participants in the vaccine group (frequency category \"Rare\" ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) reported an event of acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) . Onset was Day 37 after Dose 1 and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) were reported in the placebo group. Cases of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis have been identified post -marke ting. A waiting time post - vaccination of at least 15 minutes has been established in each vaccination centre. There were no clinically meaningful differences by age group, baseline SARS -CoV-2 status, ethnicity, race, or sex. Laboratory Results Laboratory results are available for the two Phase 1 studies. Except for a minor transient decrease in the lymphocyte count observed for some of the subjects, no abnormal lab results were reported from the Phase 1 studies.

The lower limit of 90.0% for the 95% CI for the primary endpoint exceeded the pre -specified 30% lower margin established by the WHO and FDA. A vaccine efficacy (VE) of 95.0% shows a very high degree of protection against COVID -19 and thus a highly significant benefit of vaccination. It is likely that the vaccine also protects against severe COVID -19 although, because of a very low number of severe cases, the power of the study did not allow any statistical conclusions to be drawn. A vaccine efficacy of 95% means that if 100 unvaccinated persons are ill with COVID -19, had they been vaccinated only 5 instead of 100 would have fallen ill. Vaccine efficacy is the relative reduction in the risk: whatever a person's risk was before, it is reduced by 95% by the vaccine. It does NOT mean there is a 5% chance of getting COVID -19 if vaccinated. The risk of infection will depend on vaccination status, prevalence of the disease in the population, precautionary measures put in place and individual behaviour. Uncertainties and R isks Uncertainties at the time Swissmedic granted a temporary authori sation included: The median follow -up after completion of the full vaccination regimen was 1.5 months. Available efficacy data are therefore limited in term s of follow -up duration, and the efficacy of the vaccine over a longer time (duration of protection) remains unknown. More data are expected t o become available post -authorisation. SwissPAR 27 / 29 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 As COVID -19 vaccines are becoming available in the form of EUAs or conditional / temporary approvals in different countries, several phase 3 study participants are likely to quit the study and/or to want to break the blind in order to get the vaccine. Moreover, ac cording to study amendment 10, all study participants will be unblinded 6 months after the second dose and those in the placebo group will receive vaccine. This will make an efficacy and safety follow -up with full study integrity impossible. The percentage of study subjects from certain subgroups is low in view of the targeted population at risk for severe COVID : only about 25% of participants are over 65 years of age, and only about 20% have comorbidities. In the 75 -85 years and >85 years age groups, 837 and 5 participants respectively had been vaccinated with BNT162b2 (Dose 2 all -available efficacy). There are therefore not enough participants over 85 years of age to provide interpretable data for this age group. Nevertheless , the vaccine efficacy for persons over 65 overall is 94.7% (66.7%, 99.9%). The design of the study did not test for asymptomatic infections in vaccine recipients or the potential spread to contacts. Persistence of immunogenicity is unknown. The correlates of protection (specific imm unogenic responses that are particularly protective or not protective of infection) have not been elucidated to date . There are no long- term data on rare, unexpected risks that may appear with time or as more people get vaccinated. As seasonal influenza vaccines and other vaccines were not given concurrently with the COVID -19 vaccine, there are no data on the possibility of simultaneous vaccinations with other types of vaccines. Potential interactions between vaccine and medicines have not been studied. Protection after only one dose, as well as the need for a second dose in previously infected persons , have not been tested. No data, or very limited data, are available on pregnant and lactating women, immunocompromised persons, and paediatric subjects. Benefit / Risk A ssessment Comirnaty was the first COVID -19 vaccine to receive a temporary marketing authorisation in Switzerland. The pandemic situation as described above under \"Medical Context\" and the vaccine's high efficacy for protection against t he development of COVID -19 symptoms, together with an acceptable safety profile, justified an early, temporary authorisation. The risk reduction benefit clearly exceeds the potential safety risks. Additional and longer -term data are being collected with a view to definitive authorisation. Post -marketing data are also being gathered under the overview of regulatory authorities (such as FDA, EMA, Health Canada, MHRA, Swissmedic) using established database networks, thus guaranteeing adequate surveillance of efficacy and safety over the long term. Risk minimisation activities and safety studies are ongoing (see the RMP summary on the Swissmedic website). In view of the rolling submission procedure and temporary authorisation in accordance with Art. 9a TPA, the Swiss prescribing information will be updated as needed.
