Even if you do end up catching a cold, these suggestions will help speed up your recovery! If you want to stay strong and healthy all year long, nothing is better than giving the body a little extra love to help boost a weak immune system. LIFESTYLE PRACTICES TO BOOST A WEAK IMMUNE SYSTEM Activity: Reduced Activity, especially in winter, can cause us to drag and feel off. Movement can support your detox organs, keep your lymph moving, and give a natural boost to a weak immune system. Get Outside: When we spend too much time indoors, we can't benefit from fresh air and sunshine, which can improve our mental health and immunity. Sleep: The greatest tool for stress reduction that can boost a weak immune system is sleep. Optimize your sleep and commit to at least 8 hours a night. Reduce Alcohol: Be mindful of alcohol consumption. Too much dehydrates your body and depresses your immune system, making it easier to get sick. Handwashing: Wash your hands with hot water, especially after using your computer or phone, and before making food. Vitamin D3: Take vitamin D3 daily. If you're not spending time in the sun, consider taking 2,000 IU as a maintenance dose. During winter, take 3,000-5,000 IU of vitamin D3 to help reduce your chances of contracting a cold. Probiotics: Why take probiotics? Taking probiotics helps our bodies usher out toxins we encounter from our food and water. Additionally, they help modulate your immune system and fight sickness-causing invaders. Enzymes: Often, a weak immune system is triggered by undigested food particles. Digestive enzymes help us digest the foods we eat by improving our nutrient assimilation and supporting our immune function. Take enzymes with meals, especially if they are fatty or restaurant food. Daily Shake: Supportive nutrients and proteins are key to a properly functioning immune system. Having a Daily Shake is an excellent way to get the micronutrients your immune system needs in a tasty and easy-to-take form. More Fruits and Veggies: Bump up your intake of plant foods and green powders. Plant phytonutrients help to relieve stress, reduce inflammation, and revive a weak immune system. Cut Irritating Foods: Gluten, dairy, sugar, and alcohol are the most common foods that cause irritation, sensitivities, and allergies. Be intentional about when you eat these foods and swap in clean, whole foods as much as possible. Clean House: The 21-Day Clean Program is the ultimate immune support system. It reduces many of the food items and unhealthy habits that can overburden us. We recommend doing an extended cleanse program at least once a year to give your body a chance to clean house and show it some much needed appreciation!
