This SPD includes information relating to: Who is eligible to participate in the Over -65 Retiree Plan How to enroll in the Over -65 Retiree Plan When you may change your coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan When your coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan ends Benefits available under the Over -65 Retiree Plan How to file your claims for benefits How to appeal if your claim is denied Your privacy rights with respect to the Over -65 Retiree Plan Your rights under federal law (including ERISA) Administrative information about the Over -65 Retiree Plan For the Over -65 Retiree Plan, a \"plan year\" is January 1 to December 31. This SPD describes the Over - 65 Retiree Plan in effect as of October 1, 2017. WHO IS ELIGIBLE You are eligible for coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan if you are in one of the cat egories described below. Individuals Who Retired Before Age 65 If you retired before reaching age 65, upon reaching age 65 as a Retiree, you will be eligible to enroll in the Over -65 Retiree Plan if you meet the following conditions: You previously enroll ed in medical coverage under the DePaul University Medical Plan (the \"Medical Plan\") as a pre -65 Retiree (see the separate SPD for the DePaul University Health Benefits Plans (\"Health Plans\") for pre -65 Retiree eligibility requirements) ; and You continue t o be covered under the Medical Plan as a pre -65 Retiree through the last day of the month prior to your 65th birthday. DePaul will notify you of your eligibility for the Over -65 Retiree Plan prior to the first day of the month in which you turn age 65 and will explain the steps you need to take to complete enrollment in the Over -65 Retiree Plan. Individuals Who Retire On or After Age 65 If you retire on or after you reach age 65, you will be eligible to enroll in the Over -65 Retiree Plan if you meet the f ollowing conditions as of the date of your retirement: You are enrolled in the Medical Plan under one of the following classifications: full-time employee (if you are in a voluntary reduced work time arrangement, you are considered a \"full -time employee\" for the purpose of determining eligibility for the Over -65 Retiree Plan); or member of DePaul's sponsoring religious order; and You have at least 10 years of cumulative full -time service with DePaul. Excluded Classifications You are not eligible to enroll in the Over -65 Retiree Plan if, prior to your retirement, you are: covered by a collective bargaining agreement; in a position classified as a student employee; in an instructional associate position; in a position classified as a temporary employee; 89996073.1 2 a part-time employee; a member of the Midwest Province of the Congregation of the Mission; an employee who has a non -U.S. home country or non -U.S. permanent residence, and you are employed in a position that will require you to work in a non -U.S. location ; designated by DePaul to be an independent contractor (whether determined at a later date to be a common law employee or otherwise); or a Trustee. How Your Contribution Towards Coverage Is Determined If you were hired on or before April 1, 2006 into a full -time faculty or staff position, or if you have an official offer of employment letter for a full -time faculty or staff position dated on or before April 1, 2006, you and DePaul will share in the cost of your coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan. If you elect medical coverage for your spouse or unrelated Second Domiciled Adult (\"Unrelated SDA\") as described below in Eligible Dependents , DePaul will also share in the cost of coverage for your spouse or Unrelated SDA. The amount you pay for coverage will depend on your Grandfathered Group classification, as outlined in the chart below. If you were hired after April 1, 2006 and you do not have an official offer of employment letter for a full - time fa culty or staff position dated on or before April 1, 2006, you will pay the full amount of the cost for your coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan, as well as the full amount of the cost for medical coverage for any dependents you choose to cover. As a R etiree, you pay for all coverage you elect on an after -tax basis. Premium payments and any other required payments must be sent to Blue Cross Blue Shield (for the Medicare Advantage option) or to DePaul (for the Medicare HMO option) at the applicable addr ess included at the end of this SPD under General Plan Information . Grandfathered Group Definition How Your Contribution Is Calculated Category One* Includes all eligible Retirees who retired before July 1, 2004. You pay 20% of the cost of coverage.* DePaul pays 80% of the cost of coverage for you, your spouse or Unrelated SDA and/or your dependent children. Category Two Includes all eligible Retirees who: were actively employed by DePaul as of July 1, 2004; and satisfied one of the following combinat ions of age and service, as of July 1, 2004: at least age 55, with 20 years of cumulative full -time service, or at least age 62, with 10 years of cumulative full -time service. You pay 20% of the cost of coverage. DePaul pays 80% of the cost of coverage for you, your spouse or Unrelated SDA and/or your dependent children. Category Three Includes all eligible Retirees who: were hired by DePaul before January 1, 1994 and were actively employed by DePaul as of July 1, 2004; and satisfied one of the following combinations of age and service, as of July 1, 2009 (but not as of July 1, 2004): You pay 30% of the cost of coverage. DePaul pays 70% of the cost of coverage, for you, your spouse or Unrelated SDA and/or your dependent children. 89996073.1 3 Grandfathered Group Definition How Your Contribution Is Calculated at least age 55, with 20 years of cumulative full -time service, or at least age 62, with 10 years of cumulative full -time service. Category Four Includes all eligible Retirees who were actively employed by DePaul as of July 1, 2004 and who, as of July 1, 2004: had at least 20 years of service; but had not yet reached age 55. You pay 30% of the cost of coverage. DePaul pays 70% of the cost of coverage for you, your spouse or Unrelated SDA and/or your dependent children. Category Five Includes all eligible Retirees who: were hired by DePaul on or before April 1, 2006; OR have an official offer of employment letter for a full -time faculty or staff position, that is dated on or before April 1, 2006; and do not meet the requirements for Grandfathered Group Categories 1 - 4. Includes all eligible Retirees who: have an original full-time hire date that is before April 2, 2006; and retired and were re -hired by DePaul into a full-time faculty or staff position after April 1, 2006. DePaul pays a flat -dollar amount towards the cost of coverage . This flat -dollar amount is calculated as follows: 80% of the full premium amount that was in effect as of July 1, 2004, increased each year by the greater of: the Consumer Price Index, or the weighted DePaul University tuition increase. Beginning in 2013, if the percentage increase in the full premium amount for the year is less than the increase in the Consumer Price Index or the weighted DePaul University tuition increase, then the percentage change in the full premium amount (whether p ositive or negative) will be applied equally to the premium paid by DePaul and the premium you pay. You pay the difference between the cost of coverage (including coverage for your spouse or Unrelated SDA and/or your dependent children), and the flat -dollar amount that DePaul pays. *If you are in Grandfathered Group - Category One and you retired prior to November 26, 1990 under an agreement that states that you pay a fixed cost for Over -65 Retiree Plan coverage, the amount you pay for your coverage is stated in the terms of the applicable agreement. If you, your spouse or Unrelated SDA, or both of you, are covered under the Over -65 Retiree Plan and other dependents are covered under the pre -65 retiree coverage under the Medical Plan, the Plan Administrator determines your premiums by blending the applicable rate for coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan with the applicable rate for coverage under the Medical Plan, to determine the overall cost for coverage elected under both plans. If You Return to Work at DePaul After You Have Retired After you retire, if you return to work at DePaul at a later date, your eligibility for retiree coverage from DePaul may end. 89996073.1 4 If you have already begun receiving benefits under the Over -65 Retiree Plan and you return to work in a part-time or full -time position in which you are eligible for Medical Plan benefits as an active employee (see the Health Plans SPD), you will no longer be eligible to participate in the Over -65 Retiree Plan, but you will be eligible for Health Plans coverage as an employee. If you return to work in a full-time position, when you subsequently retire your Grandfathered Group classific ation will be determined using your initial date of hire and your most recent date of retirement. If you return to work in a part -time position, when you subsequently retire, you will not be eligible to reenroll under the Over -65 Retiree Plan . Exceptio n for Retirees Rejoining the Active Medical Plan on January 1, 2015 There is an exception to the above rule. If you are an active part -time employee and eligible for part -time benefits under the Medical Plan beginning January 1, 2015, and you were enrolle d in retiree coverage under the Medical Plan or the Over -65 Retiree Plan as of December 31, 2014, when you subsequently retire or lose eligibility for Medical Plan benefits as an employee, you will be eligible to reenroll at that time in retiree coverage u nder the Over -65 Retiree Plan, based on your initial date of hire with DePaul and your most recent date of retirement. However, if you later drop your retiree medical coverage with DePaul again, for any reason, including because you again become eligible for benefits as an active employee, you will not be eligible to rejoin the Over -65 Retiree Plan at a later date, under any circumstances . ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS If you are eligible to enroll in coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan, you also may enroll ( or continue coverage for) your spouse or Unrelated SDA who is age 65 or older and eligible for Medicare in the Over - 65 Retiree Plan. Your spouse is your legal spouse under federal law, including a spouse from whom you are separated under a legal separatio n decree. An Unrelated SDA is an adult (same or opposite sex as you) member of your household who: is not related to you in any way that would prohibit marriage; is not legally married to any person; is at least 18 years of age prior to the effective date of the coverage; has shared your principal place of residence for at least the 6 months immediately prior to the effective date of the coverage; has a close personal relationship with you (not a casual roommate or tenant) that you and the SDA intend to be permanent; shares with you a mutual obligation of support and responsibility for each other's welfare; and does not have other group health insurance. Your Unrelated SDA also includes an individual with whom you have entered into a civil union in Illinois, or a civil union, registered domestic partnership, or equivalent relationship that is recognized under the applicable law of another state, as long as such relationship has not been dissolved under applicable law. For coverage terms applicable to your spouse or SDA who has not yet reached age 65 and become eligible for Medicare, your dependent children, or your SDA's children, under the PPO option or the HMO Illinois option offered under the Medical Plan, see the separate Health Plans SPD. Note that your Related SDA is not eligible for coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan. Additional Taxation of Benefits Under federal law, if you enroll in heal th coverage on behalf of an Unrelated SDA who does not meet the criteria to be considered your tax dependent for health coverage purposes, DePaul is required to report as taxable income to you the value of the health coverage DePaul provides on behalf of t he Unrelated 89996073.1 5 SDA. To be a tax dependent for health coverage purposes, an Unrelated SDA must be a citizen or national of the United States, or a resident of the United States, Mexico or Canada and must: share your principal residence for the full tax year (except for temporary reasons such as vacation, military service, or education) as a member of your household; receive more than 50% of his or her annual financial support from you; and not be a qualifying child of you or any other taxpayer for the year. Compliance with Federal Tax Rules DePaul will comply with the federal tax rules as follows: Coverage for an Unrelated SDA will automatically be on a taxable basis, unless you return a completed Declaration of Tax Status form to the Benefits Department; and Tax status changes will be made on a prospective basis only. If you enroll an Unrelated SDA who is not your tax dependent for health coverage purposes, DePaul will: Establish the fair market value of the health coverage; and Report this amount (less your after-tax contributions) as income to you on a W -2. Requirement to Notify DePaul if Your Dependent's Eligibility Changes If your dependent ceases to satisfy the eligibility requirements for coverage, you must notify DePaul within 31 days following the event. Important Note Regarding Ineligible Dependents If you cover a dependent who, in fact, does not meet the eligibility requirements, you will be responsible for reimbursing claims paid on behalf of the dependent, for any time during which the dependent was not an eligible dependent. Further, you may be subject to back taxes and IRS penalties. PROGRAM OVERVIEW DePaul offers two options for medical coverage for over -65 Retirees, the Medicare Advantage option and the Medicare HMO option. Each o f these options is available to all Retirees who enroll in the Over -65 Retiree Plan. Each option provides a comprehensive prescription drug benefit, in addition to medical benefits. The Medicare Advantage option requires you to enroll in Medicare Part A and Part B before you can elect coverage under this option. If you do not enroll in Medicare Part A and Part B, you will not be permitted to elect the Medicare Advantage option. The Medicare HMO option is intended to coordinate with your coverage under Medicare, so this option pays benefits under the assumption that you have enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B. If you do not enroll in Medicare Part A and Part B, the Over -65 Retiree Plan will not pay expenses that would have been covered by Part A and Part B. Specific details about each program option can be found in Program Details . MEDICARE OVERVIEW Medicare is health insurance for people age 65 and older, or those under age 65 with certain disabilities. This section provides a brief overview of M edicare. It is provided for informational purposes only. It is not intended to serve as an official Medicare plan summary. If there is any conflict between the information in this document and Medicare law, Medicare law will always govern. Call 800 -MEDICAR E or visit www.medicare.gov for more information. 89996073.1 6 When Medicare Coverage Begins You are eligible to enroll in Medicare upon the earliest of the following: The first of the month in which you turn age 65; If you are receiving Social Security Disability benefits, the first of the month after you have received such benefits for 24 months; or If you are entitled to End -Stage Renal Disease benefits, three months after your dialysis starts, or the month you enter a Hos pital for a transplant. Medicare Part A Eligibility and Enrollment Medicare Part A is also known as basic Medicare, or the hospital insurance benefit. If you are receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits, you are eligible for Medicare Part A and will be enrolled automatically. If you meet any of the foll owing criteria, you must apply for Medicare Part A: You have End -Stage Renal Disease; You are entitled to disabled widow's or widower's benefits; You are at least age 65, and you did not apply for Social Security retirement benefits. Covered Expenses Medicare Part A covers the following types of expenses: In-patient hospital care; In-patient care in a skilled nursing facility; Hospice care services; and Home health care services. Expenses That Are Not Covered Medicare Part A does not cover the followin g types of expenses: Services covered by Medicare Part B; Services covered by Medicare Part D; Private -duty nursing; Personal Items; Additional costs for a non -medically necessary private room; Custodial care; and Long -term care. Medicare Part B Eligibility and Enrollment Medicare Part B supplements the Part A benefit by covering physician charges and certain other services not covered under Part A. If you are receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits, you are eligible for Medicare Part B and can enroll during your initial enrollment period. Your initial enrollment period: Begins on the first of the month, three months before you reach age 65; and Ends seven months later. You may enroll for Part B at any time during the seven -month initial enrollment period. You also may be able to enroll for Part B during a Medicare special enrollment period. Call 800 - MEDICARE or visit www.medicare.gov for more information about special enrollment periods. 89996073.1 7 Medicare Part D If you enroll in the Medicare Advantage option, your coverage will include Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage and you cannot separately enroll in a Medicare Part D plan (including another group health plan that includes Medicare Part D coverage) . Note that in addition to your contribution for coverage as described in the How Your Contribution for Coverage Is Determined section, depending on your yearly income you may be required to pay an extra amount for Medicare Part D coverage directly to the Socia l Security Administration . See https://www.medicare.gov/part -d/costs/premiums/drug -plan- premiums.html for more information. If you enroll in the Medicare HMO option, your coverage will include prescription drug benefits that are, on average, at least as good as Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage. Therefore, if you enroll in the Medicare HMO option, you do not need to e nroll in Medicare Part D to have prescription drug coverage. If you do enroll in Medicare Part D (including another group health plan that includes Medicare Part D coverage) , your eligibility for the Over -65 Retiree Plan will be terminated, and you will not be eligible to re - enroll in the Over -65 Retiree Plan at a future date. JOINING THE OVER -65 RETIREE PLAN There are two different circumstances under which you may enroll in the Over -65 Retiree Plan. You may enroll: When you are enrolled in the Medical Plan as a pre -65 Retiree, and you first become eligible to enroll in the Over -65 Retiree Plan; or When you retire on or after age 65 and you meet the eligibility requirements to enroll in the Over -65 Retiree Plan. You may enroll your eligible spouse or Un related SDA under the same circumstances. In addition, you may enroll your eligible spouse or Unrelated SDA during the annual enrollment period, and you may be able to enroll your eligible spouse or Unrelated SDA mid -year if you experience an event that e ntitles you to a special enrollment period. INITIAL ENROLLMENT Individuals Who Retire Before Age 65 If you retire before age 65 and you are enrolled in the Medical Plan as a pre -65 Retiree, you will receive a letter informing you of your upcoming enrollm ent in the Over -65 Retiree Plan . You must return a copy of your Medicare card to the Benefits Department within 31 days of the date on which you turn 65 in order to complete your enrollment . If you were enrolled in the PPO option under the Medical Plan, you will be enrolled in the Medicare Advantage option under the Over -65 Retiree Plan. Enrollment in the Medicare Advantage plan cannot be completed without your Medicare number. You will be a ble to change your coverage election during the next annual enrollment period (or if you experience an event that entitles you to a Medicare special enrollment period. You also may make certain changes to your coverage during the annual Medicare Advantage disenrollment period. If you were enrolled in the HMO Illinois option under the Medical Plan, you will be enrolled in the Medicare HMO option under the Over -65 Retiree Plan. You will be able to change your coverage election during the next annual enrol lment period (or if you experience a qualified change event that allows you to change your coverage elections mid -year, see Changing Your Coverage ). 89996073.1 8 Individuals Who Retire On or After Age 65 If you retire on or after age 65 and you are eligible for coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan, you will receive an enrollment kit in the mail at your home. You must complete the enrollment form(s) and return it to the Benefits Department within 31 days of your retirement date. If you do not complete and ret urn the form(s) by this deadline, you will waive your right to elect coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan, and you will not have another opportunity to enroll in the future . Your Spouse or Unrelated SDA Who Is Age 65 and Entitled to Medicare If you r spouse or Unrelated SDA is age 65 or over and entitled to Medicare, he or she may continue medical coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan when you enroll in the Over -65 Retiree Plan. The necessary form s to complete to continue spouse or Unrelated SDA cov erage will be included in your enrollment kit . Your Other Eligible Dependents To continue Medical Plan coverage for a spouse or Unrelated SDA who has not yet reached age 65 and become entitled to Medicare, or to continue Medical Plan coverage for an eli gible dependent child or a Related SDA, you must complete and submit the required forms that are included in your enrollment kit (if applicable) , or you may contact the Benefits Department to confirm that coverage will continue. ANNUAL ENROLLMENT Each fa ll, DePaul will offer an annual enrollment period, during which you will have the opportunity to change your coverage election under the Over -65 Retiree Plan for the next calendar year. DePaul will notify over -65 Retirees of the enrollment period and annu al enrollment deadline, along with instructions about the forms and deadlines for changing coverage elections. Information about annual enrollment is available on the Human Resources website at http://offices.depaul.edu/human -resources or may be obtained from the Benefits Department. If You Do Not Re -enroll Changes will not be allowed after the annual enrollment deadline, unless you experience a qualified change event that permits you to change you r elections, as described below , or a Medicare special enrollment event (for the Medicare Advantage option), as described in the Evidence of Coverage handbook . If you do not re -enroll during the annual enrollment period, you will continue to have the same coverage elections that you had in place the year before. CHANGING YOUR COVERAGE Once you enroll in the Over -65 Retiree Plan, you generally cannot change your coverage elections until the following annual enrollment period. However, there are certain ci rcumstances described below, when you may be eligible to change your elections outside of the annual enrollment period. If you experience a qualified change event , you may be allowed to change your coverage elections outside of the annual enrollment perio d, if the change results from and is consistent wi th the qualified change event. You should contact the Benefits Department for more information and to request a Flexible Benefits Enrollment - Family Status Change form to complete and return. You must return the form (along with any required documentation) and request the change within the time periods described below for each type of qualified change event. If you do not request to change your coverage elections within the required time period, you will not be allowed to change your coverage until the next annual enrollment period (unless you experience another qualified change event). Qualified change events include: 89996073.1 9 HIPAA special enrollment - applies to dependent coverage elections only Qualified change in status Significant cost or coverage change Your election change will be effective as of the later of (1) the date on which you complete and return the Flexible Benefits Enrollment - Family Status Chang e form, or (2) the date of the qualified change event. You will have 31 days following the date of the qualified change event to provide any required supporting documentation to the Benefits Department. Special Enrollment Rules - Changes to Dependent Cov erage Elections Only Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\"), you are allowed to enroll your eligible dependents outside of the annual enrollment period when certain events occur. Special enrollment rights arise when: You a cquire a new dependent due to marriage, birth, adoption or placement for adoption; You declined coverage for your eligible dependent during a previous enrollment period because he or she was covered under another group health plan (or group health insuran ce), but he or she subsequently loses the other coverage for any of the following reasons: He or she exhausts COBRA continuation coverage under the other group health plan (other than due to failure to pay contributions or for cause); Employer contributi ons toward the other group health plan coverage terminate; or He or she loses eligibility under the other group health plan or health insurance coverage (other than due to a failure to pay contributions or for cause), including: o As a result of legal sepa ration, divorce, cessation of dependent status, death, termination or reduction in hours of employment; o In the case of an individual HMO policy, loss of coverage after moving away from the service area; o In the case of a group HMO, loss of coverage after moving away from the service area, provided that no other benefit package is available; o He or she incurs a claim that meets or exceeds a lifetime limit on all benefits; or o Your dependent's current employer decides to stop contributing for his or her covera ge. He or she becomes: o ineligible for coverage under a Medicaid plan or a state child health plan, and as a result coverage is terminated; or o eligible for a premium assistance subsidy under Medicaid or a state child health plan. If the Special Enrollment Right Is Due to Acquiring a New Dependent When a special enrollment right results from the fact that you acquire a new spouse or dependent through marriage, birth or adoption, you can enroll your new spouse or dependent in the Medical Plan (or the Medicar e HMO option under the Over -65 Retiree Plan, in the case of a spouse who has reached age 65 and become eligible for Medicare). If your spouse is not already enrolled in the Medical Plan (or the Over -65 Retiree Plan, in the case of a spouse who has reached age 65 and become eligible for Medicare) and a special enrollment right arises because you acquire a new dependent, you can enroll your spouse in the Medical Plan (or the Medicare HMO option of the Over -65 Retiree Plan, as applicable) during the special e nrollment period. However, you cannot enroll any other dependents who were already eligible for benefits but not previously enrolled for coverage. Timing Rules for Requesting an Election Change The request for a change in coverage must be made within 31 days of the special enrollment event, unless the special enrollment event is your dependent becoming ineligible for coverage under a Medicaid plan or a state child health plan, or your dependent becoming eligible for a premium assistance subsidy under Medi caid or the state child health plan. For this special enrollment event, the request for a change 89996073.1 10 in coverage must be made within 60 days of the date your dependent loses coverage or becomes eligible for coverage, as applicable. Change in Status Event You may make a change to your coverage elections (under the Medical Plan and/or the Medicare HMO option of the Over -65 Retiree Plan, as applicable) when certain change in status events occur, but only if the change is consistent with the event. The coverage change must be on account of and correspond to a change in status event that affects your dependent's eligibility for Medical Plan coverage or c overage under another employer's plan (including a change in status event that results in an increase or decrease in the number of your dependents who may benefit from coverage). The request for a change in coverage must be made within 31 days of the chan ge in status event. The Benefits Department will review the situation to determine if a change in status event has occurred and if the requested election change is consistent with the change in status event. The following are change in status events: Number of dependents \u2014you gain or lose a dependent (birth, adoption, placement for adoption, death); Marital status \u2014your marital status changes (marriage, divorce, legal separation, annulment, death of a spouse); Employment status \u2014change in the employment status of your spouse or dependent, including: termination or commencement of employment, a strike or lockout, commencement of or return from an unpaid leave of absence and a change in worksite or other change in employment that affects eligibility under a health plan; Dependent satisfies or ceases to satisfy eligibility requirements \u2014your dependent becomes eligible or ceases to be eligible on account of age, or any similar circumstance, in the Medical Plan or under another plan; and Residence \u2014a change in pl ace of residence for you, your spouse, or your dependent. Significant Cost or Coverage Change You may also change your coverage elections (under the Medical Plan and/or the Medicare HMO option of the Over -65 Retiree Plan) outside of the annual enrollment period if: Your coverage or your dependents' coverage is significantly reduced or ends (if the significant reduction results in a loss of coverage, you may revoke coverage under that option and elect coverage under a similar option, or if no similar option is available, drop coverage; if the significant reduction does not result in a loss of coverage, you may revoke coverage under that option and elect coverage under a similar option, but you may not drop coverage completely); The cost of a benefit option significantly increases (you may elect to pay the increased cost for your current option, select a new benefit option, or revoke your coverage if there is no similar option); The cost of a benefit option significantly decreases (you may select that option ); A similar benefit option is added, significantly improved or eliminated, and you are eligible to elect the new or improved option; or There are significant changes under your spouse's plan due to a mid -year election change that satisfies the IRC regula tions, or a change during an open enrollment period where your spouse's plan has a different plan year or enrollment period than the Medical Plan and/or the Over -65 Retiree Plan. If you are enrolled in the Medicare Advantage option, additional special enr ollment period rules may apply, as described in the Evidence of Coverage handbook . WHEN COVERAGE ENDS Your coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan will end on the last day of the month in which any of the following occurs: 89996073.1 11 you become eligible for Medical Plan benefits as an active employee of DePaul; the Over -65 Retiree Plan is terminated; you stop making the contributions needed to pay for your coverage; you enroll in Medicare Part D; you enroll in another plan that includes Medicare Part D ; or you elect to terminate coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan. If your coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan ends for any reason (other than if you are re -employed by DePaul as a full -time employee) you will not be allowed to re -enroll in the Over -65 Retir ee Plan at any time in the future. If your spouse or Unrelated SDA is covered under the Over -65 Retiree Plan, his or her coverage will end as of the date on which any of the following occurs: the Over -65 Retiree Plan is terminated; your spouse or Unrelated SDA ceases to meet the eligibility requirements; you stop making contributions needed to pay for your spouse's or Unrelated SDA's coverage; you elect to terminate coverage for your spouse or Unrelated SDA under the Over -65 Retire e Plan; your spouse enrolls in Medicare Part D; your spouse enrolls in another plan that includes Medicare Part D ; or your coverage ends for any reason other than due to your death. If you are enrolled in the Medicare Advantage option, Medicare requires your coverage to end in certain circumstances in addition to those listed above, as described in the Evidence of Coverage handbook . Rescission of Coverage Your Over -65 Retiree Plan coverage may be cancelled or discontinued retroactively only if: (1) the cancellation or discontinuance of coverage is effective retroactively to the extent it is attributable to a failure to timely pay required contributions for coverage, or (2) the cancellation or discontinuance of coverage is not considered to be a prohibited rescission under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and applicable guidance. Your Over -65 Retiree Plan coverage may be rescinded if you perfor m an act, practice or omission that constitutes fraud in an enrollment form or in a claim for benefits, or if you make an intentional misrepresentation of material fact to the Plan Administrator regarding any information material to your eligibility for be nefits. The Plan Administrator will provide you with written notice at least 30 days in advance of the rescission of your coverage. Any rescission of coverage is treated as a denial of benefits for purposes of the Over -65 Retiree Plan claims procedures. A retroactive termination due to your non -payment of contributions is not considered a rescission. Note about Continuing Coverage Refer to Continuing Coverage after Plan Coverage Ends below, or contact the Benefits Department to find out more about ava ilable coverage continuation options. CONTINUING COVERAGE AFTER PLAN COVERAGE ENDS COBRA If your spouse loses coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan as the result of divorce, he or she may be eligible to continue benefits coverage at his or her own expen se for up to 36 months, in accordance with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (\"COBRA\"). In accordance with the rules described below, your spouse will be provided with information and an opportunity to continue coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan program option in which he or she is enrolled at the time of your divorce. Coverage Options other than COBRA Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for your spouse through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid through what is called a \"special enrollment 89996073.1 12 period.\" Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. You can learn more about many of these options at www.H ealthCare.gov . Notice Requirement and Electing Continuation Coverage You or your spouse must inform the Benefits Department within 60 days of the last day of the month in which your divorce occurs to request notice of COBRA continuation rights. You may provide notice orally, electronically or in writing. If you do not give notice within the required time period, your spouse may not elect continuation coverage. If you provide timely notice of divorce, the COBRA administrator will notify your spouse of his or her right to continue coverage and provide your spouse with the necessary information to complete an election. Your spouse will have 60 days from the later of the date coverage is lost, or the date the notice of the right to continue coverage is re ceived, whichever date is later, to elect continuation coverage. If the election is not completed within the 60 -day period, your spouse will not have continuation coverage and will have no further rights to elect such coverage. Coverage During the Election Period As of the date coverage is terminated, your spouse will not have any coverage until he or she elects continuation coverage and pays the required premiums. This means no claims will be paid during the election period. In order to receive u ninterrupted coverage, your spouse should elect continuation coverage and make the required premium payments as soon as possible after receiving the notice of continuation coverage. See Cost of COBRA Continuation Coverage below. If a completed election f orm is received and all required premiums are paid in a timely fashion, coverage becomes retroactive to the date coverage was terminated. Cost of COBRA Continuation Coverage The cost for continuation coverage is 102% of the full cost for providing coverag e to a similarly situated dependent. However, if you are enrolled in the Medicare Advantage option when a qualifying event occurs, the cost of COBRA coverage may be limited by rules applicable to Medicare premiums. Your spouse's first payment is due 45 d ays after his or her election and must cover the period of time back to the first day of COBRA continuation coverage. Subsequent payments are due once a month. Payment coupons will be sent to your spouse after he or she elects continuation coverage. If the COBRA Administrator does not receive your spouse's monthly contribution within 30 days of the due date, continuation coverage will be canceled as of the last day of the month in which a contribution was received. If your spouse qualifies for coverage continuation under COBRA, he or she may elect to continue the coverage in effect at the time his or her regular coverage ends but may not change his or her coverage election. Following your spouse's initial enrollment in COBRA continuation coverage, he or she may change coverage elections during the next annual enrollment period, or if he or she experiences a qualified change event. Termination Before the End of the Maximum Coverage Period Normally, your spouse's continuation coverage may be continued for up to 36 months, as long as your spouse makes timely payment of premiums. In some cases, however, continuation coverage may end before the maximum coverage period ends. Continuation coverage will terminate immediately if: DePaul no longer provides grou p health coverage to any of its employees or retirees; Your spouse fails to pay the premium for the continuation coverage elected within 30 days of the first day of the month; or After continuation coverage is elected, your spouse becomes covered under an other group health plan (as an employee or otherwise) that has no exclusion or limitation that affects coverage of a covered individual's pre -existing condition. 89996073.1 13 COBRA benefits will be paid to the person who elected to continue coverage under COBRA or to the provider of services, if benefits are assigned. Illinois Continuation Coverage for Medicare HMO Option If you participate in the Medicare HMO option, then you and your spouse or Unrelated SDA may have special Illinois continuation coverage rights. Th ese rights may include the option to convert your group health insurance coverage to a similar health insurance coverage arrangement offered through Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois (\"BCBS\"). For more information about Illinois continuation coverage rights, including conversion rights, you should refer to your HMO Illinois Insurance Certificate (or call BCBS at 800 -458-6024). PROGRAM DETAILS Over -65 Retiree Plan Options There are two program options under the Over -65 Retiree Plan , both of which are administered by BCBS: Medicare Advantage Option Medicare HMO Option Covered Health Services Health services described in this section are covered when such services are: considered \"Covered Health Services\" (refer to the Important Definitions section); provided by or under the direction of your primary physician or other appropriate provider as specifically described; determined to be \"Medically Necessary\" (refer to the Important Definitions section); and not excluded as described in the General Exclusi ons section.

How the Medicare Advantage Option Works If you have medical expenses, the Medicare Advantage option may cover all or part of the expenses based on the provisions in this section and this SPD. You may o btain services from any provider that accepts Medicare. Your Co -payments Your Co -payment is a set dollar amount you pay for certain services. You will be required to pay the established amount each time you obtain services or supplies for which a Co -payment is required. Co- payments do not apply to the annual deductible. Annual Deductible The Deductible is the portion of your eligible expenses you pay each calendar year before the Over -65 Retiree Plan pays benefits. Each individual wh o is covered under the Medicare Advantage option must satisfy the annual deductible separately. The Deductible does not apply toward the Out -of-Pocket Maximum. Your Co -Insurance and Annual Out -of-Pocket Maximum Once you meet the Deductible, where applicable, the Over -65 Retiree Plan will pay a percentage of eligible expenses for you and your spouse or Unrelated SDA (if he or she is covered under the Over -65 Retiree Plan). You pay the remaining portion of the eligible expenses, which is called Co -insurance. As added financial protection for you, the Medicare Advantage option limits the amount that you will have to pay out of your own pocket for covered medical expenses each year. Once you have satisfied your Deductible and have reached the annual O ut-of-Pocket Maximum, the Plan will pay 100% of covered medical expenses for the remainder of the year. The annual Out -of-Pocket Maximum does not carry over to the following year. 89996073.1 16 The following expenses do not apply toward the Out -of-Pocket Maximum and wi ll not be paid at 100% after you reach your Out -of-Pocket Maximum: Your annual Deductible; Any unreimbursed expense incurred for covered services received in a prior plan year, that is paid by you during the current plan year. A separate Out -of-Pocket Maximum applies to covered prescription drug expenses, as indicated in the Schedule of Benefits . Special Note about Annual Deductible and Out -of-Pocket Maximum for Certain Retirees If you are a Retiree who satisfies the requirements for Grandfathered Group - Category One, you moved from the Medicare Supplement option to the Medicare Carve -Out option as of January 1, 2011, and you moved from the Medicare Carve -Out option to the Medicare Advantage option as of January 1, 2017, you will not be required to meet the annual deductible under the Medicare Carve -Out option. You also will be treated as if you have already met the Out -of-Pocket Maximum (as described above) as of the first day of each plan year. Special Benefit Maximums - Cardiac Rehabilitation S ervices Cardiac rehabilitation services are subject to certain limitations. Specifically, benefits are available only when such services are rendered within the six -month period following an eligible inpatient hospital admission for either myocardial infa rction, coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Health Care Services Related to Organ or Tissue Transplants Special rules and requirements apply to health services that you receive related to organ or tissue transplants. For specific information about these rules and requirements, contact Blue Cross Blue Shield at 800 -458-6024, or visit www.bcbsil.com , sign in as a member and select \"View Medical Coverage.\" Procedures for Obtaining Health Services All coverage is subject to the provisions of this section and other limitations and exclusions of the Over -65 Retiree Plan. Covered Health Services You are eligible for coverage for health services described in the Covered Health Services section if such health services are considered to be covered health services and are provided by or under the direction of your eligible phys ician. Coverage for health services is subject to payment of the required contributions for coverage under the Medicare Advantage option and payment of the deductible, co -payment, or co -insurance specified for any service. Special Note Regarding Prescr iption Drug Coverage Certain prescription drugs require your prescribing physician to obtain prior authorization from BCBS or its designee for such prescription drugs to be covered under the Plan and/or require you to obtain certain prescription drugs through a specific mail o rder pharmacy for such prescription drugs to be covered under the Plan. There are four prescription drug programs, described below, which include additional requirements: Prior Authorization Program - The Medicare Advantage option requires you or your ph ysician to get prior authorization for certain drugs. This means that you will need to get approval from BCBS before you fill your prescriptions. If you don't get approval, the Plan may not cover the drug. o Examples of medication categories Included in th e Prior Authorization Program androgens/anabolic steroids antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline/minocycline) fentanyl (oral/nasal) narcolepsy opioid dependence specialty medications o For more information about the prescription drugs included in the Prior Authorization Program and the steps that need to be taken to request prior authorization , visit bcbsil.com/member/rx_drug_choices.html, select your applicable plan coverage, and scroll down to the Prior Authorizatio n/Step Therapy Program section , Quantity Limits - For certain drugs, the Medicare Advantage option limits the amount of the drug that the Plan will cover. (For example, the Medicare Advantage option provides 30 tablets per prescription for alfuzosin ER. This may be in addition to a standard one -month or three -month supply.) Step Therapy Program - In some cases, the Medicare Advantage option requires you to first try certain drugs to treat your medic al condition before the Plan will cover another drug for that condition. (For example, if Drug A and Drug B both treat your medical condition, the Medicare Advantage option may not cover Drug B unless you try Drug A first. If Drug A does not work for you, the Plan will then cover Drug B.) o Examples of Medication Categories Included in the Step Therapy Program antidepressants diabetes lipid management proton pump inhibitors biological multiple sclerosis atopic dermatitis fibrate ophthalmic prostaglandins/glaucoma Prime Specialty Pharmacy Program - Under this program, you are required to obtain specialty medications through Prime Specialty Pharmacy, which will coordinate filling your prescription and ship your medication o vernight. Specialty medicines are generally higher -cost medicines that require extra support to manage and administer. These medicines are used to treat chronic (long -term) and complex conditions. o General Program Rules For specialty medications, you will need to contact Prime Specialty Pharmacy to set up your prescription and delivery. You can reach them at 877 627-6337 with questions or for help. Pharmacy hours are 7 :00AM to 7 :00PM Central time, Monday through Friday. Prime Specialty Pharmacy will coord inate setting up the prescription, shipping your medication overnight, and consulting with the prescribing physician as needed. o Examples of Medication Categories Included in the Prime Specialty Pharmacy Program Crohns disease hemophilia hepatitis C psoriasis rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis oral oncology The lists of prescription drugs included in the Step Therapy Program and the Prime Specialty Pharmacy Program are subject to periodic review and modification by BCBS. For the most curren t lists, visit BCBS' 89996073.1 18 website at www.getblueil.com/mapd/druglist or call Blue Cross Medicare Advantage Customer Service at 1-877-774-8592 or, for TTY/TDD users, 711 . Transition Refill - As a new Participant in the Medicare Advantage option you may be taking drugs that are not on the formulary. Or, you may be taking a drug that is on the formulary but your ability to get it is limited. For example, you may need a prior authorization from BCBS befor e you can fill your prescription. You should talk to your doctor to decide if you should switch to an appropriate drug that is cover ed or request a formulary exception so that the Medicare Advantage option will cover the drug you take. While you talk to yo ur doctor to determine the right course of action for you, the Medicare Advantage option may cover your drug in certain cases during the first 90 days you are enrolled . For each of your drugs that is not on the formulary or if your ability to get your dr ugs is limited, the Medicare Advantage option will cover a temporary 30 -day supply (unless you have a prescription written for fewer days) when you go to a network pharmacy. After your first 30 -day supply, the Plan will not pay for these drugs, even if you have been participating in the Plan less than 90 days. If you are a resident of a long -term care facility, the Plan will allow you to refill your prescription until you have received a maximum 98 -day transition supply, consistent with dispensing increment, (unless you have a prescription written for fewer days). The Plan will cover more than one refill of these drugs for the first 90 days if you are a Participant in the Medicare Advan tage option . If you need a drug that is not on the formulary, or if your ability to get your drugs is limited, but you are past the first 90 days of participation in the Medicare Advantage option , the Plan will cover a 31 -day emergency supply of that drug (unless you have a prescription for fewer days) while you pursue a formulary exception. You may have changes that take you from one treatment setting to another. During this level of care change, drugs ma y be prescribed that are not covered by the Plan . If this happens, you and your doctor should refer to the Coverage Decisions and Appeals section of the Evidence of Coverage handbook for information on how to appeal the decision. You can find out if your drug has any additional requirements or limits by looking in the Formulary for the Medicare Advantage option . You can also get more information about the restrictions applied to specific covered drugs by visiting the BCBS website at www.getblueil.com/mapd/druglist or calling Blue Cross Medicare Advantage Customer Service at 1 -877-774-8592 or, for TTY/TDD users, 711. BCBS has posted online documents that explain the Prior Authorization and Step Therapy restrictions. What is the Medicare Advantage Option Formulary? A formulary is a list of covered drugs s elected by BCBS in consultation with a team of health care providers, which represents the prescription therapies believed to be a necessary part of a quality treatment program. The Medicare Advantage option will generally cover the drugs listed in the formulary as long as the drug is medically necessary, the prescription is filled at a Medicare Advantage option network pharmacy, and other Plan rules are followed. For more information on how to fill your prescriptions and what steps you may take if your dru g is not on the Formulary , please review your Evidence of Coverage handbook . All drugs included in this formulary are available via mail -order benefit. Contact BCBS for details. Verification of Participation Status You are responsible for verifying the participation status of the physician, hospital, or other provider prior to receiving health services. You are also responsible for verifying that you are enrolled in the Medicare Advantage option, and you must show yo ur ID card every time you request health services, including every time you obtain a prescription drug product from a participating pharmacy. If you fail to verify participation status or to show your ID card, and that failure results in noncompliance wit h required Over - 65 Retiree Plan procedures, coverage of benefits may be denied. 89996073.1 19 Emergency Health Services The Medicare Advantage option provides coverage of 100% of eligible expenses for emergency health services (after co -payment), without regard to whether you obtain such services from an in -network hospital or an out -of-network hospital. In order for such health services to be considered eligible expenses under the Medicare Advantage option, the health services must meet the definition of \"Emergenc y Health Services\" as described in the Important Definitions section.

How the Medicare HMO Option Works If you have medical expenses, the Medicare HMO option may cover all or part of the expenses based on the provisions in this section of this SPD. The Medicare HMO option requires the selection of a primary care physician (\"PCP\"). Your PCP will be responsible for providing your medical services and coordinating your care for specialist services. You must obtain a referral f rom your PCP for specialist services, with the exception of OB/GYN services. All services must be performed by, or require referral from, your PCP or Woman's Principal Health Care Provider except for emergency health services, substance abuse services, and annual eye exams. In order for health services to be covered, you must receive care from providers in the network. So that you will not be required to pay bills for non -covered services, you should always verify the participation status of a physician, h ospital or other provider, prior to receiving services. From time to time, the participation status of a provider may change. You can verify the participation status by calling BCBS, and, if necessary, BCBS can assist you in finding network providers. The ultimate decisions about medical care must be made by you and your physician. HMO Illinois determines only whether the listed service or supply is a covered health service according to the Over -65 Retiree Plan benefits and provisions. 89996073.1 23 Your Co -payment Your co -payment is the charge that you are required to pay for certain health services provided under the Medicare HMO option. A co -payment is generally a defined flat -dollar amount.

In order to convert your coverage you should: Contact the Plan Administrator to get an application. Send the application to the Plan within 31 days of the date that your coverage i s terminated. Having done so, you will then be covered by the Plan on an individual direct -payment basis.

The converted coverage may require co -payments and/or deductibles that are different from those shown in this document. The converted coverage will provide, at minimum, benefits for basic health care services as defined in the HMO Act. The Plan is not re quired to offer conversion coverage to you if you no longer live within the service area of a Participating IPA or Participating Medical Group.

In that case, your reimbursement will be calculated at the predominant contract reimbursement rate for the specific drug (which is a rate that is determined in the contract between BCBS a nd the pharmacy), including any sales tax, less the applicable co -insurance.

HOW THE OVER -65 RETIREE PLAN WORKS WITH OTHER PLANS If you or your spouse or Unrelated SDA is covered by the Ove r-65 Retiree Plan and another medical plan, Over -65 Retiree Plan benefits will be coordinated with benefits from the other plan. This coordination eliminates duplicate payments and lowers health care costs. Under this coordination of benefits provision, o ne plan is considered primary and the other plan is considered secondary. If the Over -65 Retiree Plan is not primary, DePaul will pay the difference (if any) between the amount that would have been paid if the Over -65 Retiree Plan was primary, and the amo unt that the primary plan actually paid (or would have paid if primary coverage is assumed). Neither the primary plan nor the secondary plan will pay more than it would without the coordination provision. Rules to Determine Payment Responsibility for the Medicare HMO Option If you are enrolled in the Medicare HMO option, y ou can determine whether the Over -65 Retiree Plan or another plan pays primary by using the following rules: If one plan does not have a Coordination of Benefits (\"COB\") provision, it wi ll automatically pay primary. 89996073.1 36 When both plans have a COB provision, the plan that covers the individual other than as a dependent ( e.g., employee, member, retiree) will pay first, and the plan that covers the individual as a dependent will pay second. A plan that covers the individual as an active employee who is neither laid off nor retired (or, in the case of a dependent, a plan that covers the individual as a dependent of an active employee) is primary to a plan that covers the individual as an inact ive employee (or, in the case of a dependent, a plan that covers the individual as a dependent of a former employee). o If the other plan does not have this rule, and the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, then this rule does not apply. If an indiv idual is covered under COBRA coverage or state continuation coverage, the plan covering the individual as an employee, member or retiree (or as that person's dependent) pays first, and the continuation coverage pays second. o This rule applies only when both plans provide non -dependent coverage to the individual or both plans provide dependent coverage to the individual. o If one plan provides dependent coverage and the other plan provides non -dependent coverage, the second rule in this section applies ( i.e., the plan that covers the individual as a dependent will pay secondary). o If the other plan does not have this rule, and the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, then this rule does not apply. If none of the above rules will serve to determine the ord er of payment of a claim, the plan that has covered the individual the longest will pay first. Benefits Coordination with Medicare If you are enrolled in the Medicare HMO option, coverage is coordinated with Medicare. When determining how much the Over -65 Retiree Plan will pay for Covered Services, the Plan assumes that you have coverage under Medicare Part A and Part B, whether or not you have actually enrolled for full coverage. If you are enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B, Medicare will pay benef its before the Over -65 Retiree Plan pays. If you are not enrolled in full coverage under Medicare, the Plan will take the following steps to determine how much it will pay for your Covered Services: Determine what the payment for Covered Services would be according to the payment provisions under the Medicare HMO option. Deduct the amount that would be paid by Medicare (if you had enrolled in full coverage under Medicare) from the payment amount determined as described above. The resulting difference, if a ny, is the amount that the Plan will pay towards the cost of the Covered Services. Rules to Determine Payment Responsibility for the Medicare Advantage Option If you are enrolled in the Medicare Advantage option and another plan, whether the Over -65 Retiree Plan or the other plan pays primary will be determined in accordance with the Medicare Secondary Payer rules. You can refer to your Evidence of Coverage handbook for more information. 89996073.1 37 RECEIVING YOUR BENEFITS - CLAIMS AND APPEALS PROCEDURES FOR THE MEDICARE HMO OPTION If you are enrolled in the Medicare HMO option, t o receive your benefits under the Over -65 Retiree Plan, either you or your provider must file a claim. When a specific claim form is required, you can get the form online throug h the Human Resources website at http://offices.depaul.edu/human -resources , or you can contact the Benefits Department directly to request the form. DePaul has delegated full discretion, authority, and fiduciary responsibility for claims and appeals decisions to the claims administrators for the Plan, excluding issues of eligibility which will be decided by the Benefits Department. Claims Related to Eligibility Claims that relate solely to whether you are eligible to participate in the Over -65 Retiree Plan, and that do not involve a claim for benefits under the Over -65 Retiree Plan, are reviewed by the Benefits Department. All decisions made by the Benefits Department are final and binding. Claims Related to Benefits Claims that relate to benefits under the Over -65 Retiree Plan, including a claim for benefits that requires an eligibility determination in order to determine whether an individual may receive benefits under the Over -65 Retiree Plan, s hould be made to the proper claims administrator in accordance with the claims filing procedures as described below. Submitting Claims The claims administrator will process the claim and send you a n Explanation of Benefits , which will detail the amounts covered and paid to the appropriate providers. If you have paid the provider and are to be reimbursed from the claims administrator, your claim must include proof of payment. You will be responsible for paying the provider any amounts not covered under th e Over -65 Retiree Plan. Claims fall into one of four categories: post -service, pre -service, urgent care and concurrent. Claims for Over -65 Retiree Plan benefits will be administered by the appropriate claims administrator. Claims for Outpatient Prescript ion Drug s Complete an Outpatient Prescription Drug Claim form. This form is available on the Human Resources website at http://offices.depaul.edu/human -resources or you may contact the Benefits Department to request a form. Attach copies of all pharmacy receipts to be considered for benefits. These receipts must be itemized. Mail t he completed claim form and att ached receipts to: Prescription Drug Claims Payment Request P.O.

Claims not filed within 36 months of the date a service, item, or drug is received will not be eligible for payment. When you r eceive care from your PCP or from another Provider who is affiliated with your Participating IPA/Participating Medical Group, or from your Woman's Principal Health Care Provider, you do not need to submit a claim for benefits, as long as you show your ID c ard to your Provider when you receive the services. 89996073.1 38 When you receive care from a Provider outside of your Participating IPA/Participating Medical Group (e.g. emergency care, medical supplies), usually all you have to do to receive your benefits is show your ID card to the Provider, and the Provider will typ ically submit any required claim information on your behalf. However, there may be situations when you will need to complete and submit claims on your own behalf. To do so, send the following information to BCBS: An itemized bill from the Hospital, Phys ician or other Provider (including the Provider's name and address, the patient's name, the diagnosis, the date of service, a description of the service, and the claim charge); The eligible person's name and ID number; The patient's name, age and sex; an d Any additional relevant information. Claims must be submitted to: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois P.O.

Box 64812 St. Paul, MN 55164 -0812 Claims must be filed no later than December 31st of the calendar year following the year in which the Covered Service was rendered. For the purposes of this fili ng time limit, Covered Services rendered in December will be considered to have been rendered in the next calendar year. Post -Service Claims Post-service claims are claims for benefits that are filed after health care has been received. If your post - service claim is denied, you will receive a written notice from the benefit program's claims administrator no later than 30 days after the claim was received, as long as all needed information was provided with the claim. Sometimes additional time is necessar y to process a claim due to circumstances beyond the control of the Over -65 Retiree Plan. If an extension is necessary, the claims administrator will notify you in writing within the 30 -day period of the reasons for the extension and the date by which it expects to render a decision. The extension generally will be no longer than 15 days, unless additional information is needed. If the extension is necessary because you failed to provide all needed information, the notice of the extension will describe th e additional information required. You will have 45 days to provide the additional information, and the time for deciding the claim will be tolled until you provide the requested information. If you do not provide the needed information within the 45 -day period, the claims administrator may deny the claim. Pre-Service Claims Pre-service claims are claims that require notification or approval prior to receiving health care (for example, in -patient hospital services, or a transplant). If you file a pre -service claim that does not meet the Over -65 Retiree Plan procedures, the claims administrator will notify you within 5 days. The notice will tell you how to correct the improperly filed claim. This notification may be oral, unless you re quest a written notification. 89996073.1 39 If your pre -service claim is submitted properly with all the information necessary, the health program's claims administrator will send you a notice of the benefit determinations, whether denied or not, no later than 15 days after it receives the claim. If an extension is necessary to process your pre -service claim due to circumstances beyond the control of the Over -65 Retiree Plan, the claims administrator will notify you in writing within the initial 15 -day response period , and may request a one -time extension up to 15 days. If the extension is necessary because you failed to provide all needed information, the notice of the extension will describe the additional information required. You will have 45 days to provide the additional information, and the time for deciding the claim will be tolled until you provide the requested information. If you do not provide the needed information within the 45 -day period, the claims administrator may deny the claim. Urgent Care Claims Urgent care claims are pre -service claims that require notification or approval prior to receiving medical care and a delay in the care: could seriously jeopardize your life, health or your ability to regain maximum function, or in the opinion of a physician with knowledge of your medical condition, could cause severe pain that could not be adequately managed without the care or treatment. If you file an urgent care claim in accordance with the Over -65 Retiree Plan procedures and include all needed information, the claims administrator will notify you of the determination, whether denied or not, as soon as possible, but no later than 72 hours after receipt of the claim. However, if you file an urgent care claim that does not meet the Over -65 Retiree Plan's procedures, the claims administrator will notify you within 24 hours. The notice will tell you how to correct the improperly filed claim. This notification may be oral, unless you request a written notification. If you fail to provide all the in formation required to decide your urgent care claim, the claims administrator will notify you that additional information is needed within 24 hours. You will then have 48 hours to provide the requested information. You will be notified of the determinatio n on your claim no more than 48 hours after the earlier of: the claims administrator's receipt of the requested information, or the end of the 48 hours given to you to provide the requested information. Concurrent Care Claims There are two types of concur rent care claims: a claim to extend coverage for a course of treatment beyond a previously approved period of time or number of treatments; or a claim regarding reduction or termination of coverage by the Over -65 Retiree Plan before the end of a previously approved period of time or number of treatments. You must submit a request to extend an ongoing course of treatment at least 24 hours before the end of the previously approved limit. If your request for extension is timely and involves urgent care, the health program's claims administrator will notify you of the determination, whether denied or not, within 24 hours after the claim is received. If your claim is not made at least 24 hours prior to the end of the previously approved limit, the request will be treated as an urgent care claim (not a concurrent care claim) and decided according to the timeframes described under Urgent Care Claims . A request to extend coverage that does not involve urgent care will be considered a new claim and will be decided according to the post -service or pre -service timeframes described previously, whichever applies. 89996073.1 40 If a previously approved ongoing course of treatment is reduced or terminated by the Over -65 Retiree Plan, the claims administrator will notify you sufficien tly in advance to allow you to submit an appeal before the treatment is reduced or terminated. Explanation of Denied Health Care Claims If your claim for pre -service, post -service, urgent care or concurrent care is denied, the written explanation of the d enial will: give the specific reason(s) for the denial and cite the applicable Over -65 Retiree Plan provisions on which the denial is based; describe any additional material or information necessary to perfect the claim and explain why such information is necessary; include information that allows you to identify the claim involved (including the date of service, the health care provider, and the claim amount (if applicable)); include a statement describing the availability of the relevant diagnosis and tr eatment codes and their corresponding meanings (if you request this information, it will be provided to you as soon as practicable following your request); provide the code assigned to the reason for the denial, the meaning of the code, and a description of the standard that was used in denying the claim (if any); disclose any internal rule, guideline, protocol, or similar criterion relied on in denying the claim (or a statement that such information will be provided free of charge upon request); if the denial is based on a medical necessity, experimental treatment or similar exclusion, explain the scientific or clinical judgment relied on for the determination (or include a statement that such explanation will be provided free of charge upon request); describe the Over -65 Retiree Plan's internal appeal procedures and external review process, including the applicable time limits and how to initiate an internal appeal or external review; for urgent care claims, describe the expedited review process applic able to such claims; and include contact information for any applicable office of health insurance consumer assistance, or ombudsman that is available to help you with the appeals process. Notifications regarding urgent care claim determinations may be or al, in which case written or electronic (via e -mail) confirmation will follow within three days. Questions about Benefit Determinations If you have questions or concerns about a benefit determination, you may informally contact the claims administrator before requesting a formal appeal. If the customer service representative cannot resolve the issue to your satisfaction over the phone, you may submit your questions in writing. Remember, however, that if you are not satisfied with a benefit determinatio n, you may appeal it immediately as described in the section that follows, without first informally contacting customer service. How to Appeal if Your Claim Is Denied If you submit a claim for benefits and your claim is denied, you have the right to appeal your claim. If you appeal a denied claim for benefits, you can obtain, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim. If you disagree with a benefit determina tion, you (or any person you choose to represent you) may file a written appeal with the claims administrator. Except for appeals involving urgent care (see Urgent Care Claims ), all appeals must be in writing. You will be informed when and where to direc t an appeal when your initial claim is denied. You may submit comments, documents, and other information in support of your appeal. The review of the appeal will take into account any information you submit, even if it was not submitted or considered as part of the initial determination. 89996073.1 41 DePaul has delegated full discretion, authority, and fiduciary responsibility for claims and appeals decisions to the claims administrators for the Over -65 Retiree Plan, excluding issues of eligibility which will be deci ded by the Benefits Department. Your Deadline to Appeal a Health Care Claim You have 180 days from receipt of the notice of a claim denial to file an appeal. Your request for appeal should include the following: the patient's name and identification numb er as shown on the program option ID card; the date of the medical service; the provider's name; the reason you believe the claim should be paid; and any documentation or other written information to support your request for claim payment. Appeals Procedu res The review of the claim denial will afford no deference to the initial benefit determination. Someone other than an individual involved in the initial benefit determination or a subordinate of such individual will be appointed to decide the appeal. If your initial claim was denied based on a medical judgment (such as whether a service or supply is experimental or medically necessary), the claims administrator will consult with a health care professional with appropriate training and experience. The h ealth care professional consulted for the first level appeal will not be the professional (if any) who was consulted for the initial claim determination or a subordinate of such professional. The claims administrator also will identify, at your request, m edical or vocational experts whose advice was obtained on behalf of the Over -65 Retiree Plan in connection with the denied benefit determination being appealed, even if the advice was not relied upon in making the benefit determination. If new or addition al evidence is considered, relied upon or generated as part of the appeal review, or if an appeal denial is based on a new or additional rationale than was used to deny your initial claim for benefits, you will be provided with this evidence or rationale a s soon as possible and sufficiently in advance of the date on which any notice of an appeal denial is required, so that you may have a reasonable chance to respond. The claims administrator or appeals committee, as applicable, will provide you written or electronic (via e - mail) notification of the determination as follows: For appeals of pre -service claims, no later than 15 days after receipt of your request for an appeal. For appeals of post -service claims, no later than 30 days after receipt of your requ est for an appeal. Coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan will continue pending the outcome of the appeal, so that benefits for an ongoing course of treatment are not reduced or terminated without providing you advance notice and an opportunity for adv ance review of the appeal. Urgent Care Appeals If your appeal involves urgent care (as defined above in Urgent Care Claims ), the appeal does not need to be submitted in writing. You or your physician should call the claims administrator for urgent care appeals, at the number indicated on your program option ID card, as soon as possible. The claims administrator will provide you written or electronic (via e -mail) notification of the determination as soon as possible, but in no event later than 72 hours after receipt of the appeal. Explanation of Denied Health Care Appeals If your health care appeal is denied, the written explanation of the denial will: 89996073.1 42 include information that allows you to identify the claim involved (including the date of service, the health care provider, and the claim amount (if applicable)); include a statement describing the availability of the relevant diagnosis and treatment codes and their corresponding meanings (if you request this information, it will be provided to you as so on as practicable following your request); provide the code assigned to the reason for the denial, the meaning of the code, a description of the standard that was used in denying the claim (if any), and, for final appeal decisions, a discussion of the dec ision to deny the appeal; state why the claim has been denied, citing applicable Over -65 Retiree Plan provisions; state that you are entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim (if you are a Medicare HMO participant, you may be subject to charges if you request documents or records directly from your medical group, instead of going through the claims and appeals process); disclose any internal r ule, guideline, protocol, or similar criterion relied on in denying the claim (or a statement that such information will be provided free of charge upon request); if the denial is based on a medical necessity, experimental treatment or similar exclusion, explain the scientific or clinical judgment relied on for the determination (or a statement that such explanation will be provided free of charge upon request); describe the Over -65 Retiree Plan's internal appeal procedures and external review process, including the applicable time limits and how to initiate an internal appeal or external review; explain your right to bring a civil action against the Over -65 Retiree Plan under ERISA Section 502(a) within one year of receipt of the denial; and include contact information for any applicable office of health insurance consumer assistance, or ombudsman, that is available to help you with the appeals process. Coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan will continue pending the outcome of the appeal, so that benefits for an ongoing course of treatment are not reduced or terminated without providing you advance notice and an opportunity for advance review of the appeal. External Review of Denied Appeals If your Over -65 Retiree Plan claim or appeal is denied, yo u may request to have an Independent Review Organization (\"IRO\") conduct a standard external review or expedited external review of the denial, as described below. External review may be available if your claim or appeal involves a rescission of Over - 65 R etiree Plan coverage, or involves medical judgment ( e.g., if the determination is based on medical necessity, appropriateness, health care setting, level of care, effectiveness of a covered benefit, or includes a determination that a particular treatment i s experimental or investigational). Standard External Review Request for External Review You may file a request for standard external review within four (4) months after you receive notice from the claims administrator that your Over -65 Retiree Plan cl aim or appeal has been denied. If there is no corresponding date four (4) months after the date of receipt of such a notice, then the request must be filed by the first day of the fifth month following the receipt of the notice. For example, if the date y ou receive the denial notice is October 30, because there is no February 30, the request must be filed by March 1. If the last filing date would fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the last filing date is extended to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Preliminary Review Within five (5) business days following the date of receipt of your external review request, the claims administrator will complete a preliminary review of the request to determine whether: You are, or were, covered under the Over -65 Retiree Plan at the time the health care item or service was requested or, in the case of a retrospective review, were covered under the Over -65 Retiree Plan at the time the health care item or service was provid ed; 89996073.1 43 The claim denial or the appeal denial involves either medical judgment or a rescission of coverage (whether or not the rescission has any effect on any particular benefit at the time); You have exhausted the Over -65 Retiree Plan's internal appeals pro cess, unless you are not required to exhaust the internal appeals process under the law. Please refer to the \"Exhaustion\" section below for additional information about exhaustion of the internal appeal process; and You have provided all the information a nd forms required to process an external review. You will be notified within one (1) business day after the claims administrator completes the preliminary review if your request is eligible for external review, or if further information or documents are needed. You will have the remainder of the four -month period described above (or 48 hours following receipt of the notice, if later) to perfect your request for external review. If your claim is not eligible for external review, the claims administrator will outline the reasons it is ineligible in the notice and will provide contact information for the Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration. Referral to Independent Review Organization If you submit your request for external review within the four -month time period described above and your claim is eligible for external review, the claims administrator will assign the matter to an IRO. The IRO assigned will be accredited by URAC or by a similar nationally -recognized accrediting organization, and the IRO will not be eligible for any financial incentives based on the likelihood that it will support the denial of benefits. In addition, the claims administrator has taken administrative steps to ensure independence in the external review process, such as using unbiased methods for selecting IROs to review claims. When your request for external review is eligible and assigned to an IRO, the following procedures will apply: The IRO will utili ze legal experts where appropriate to make coverage determinations under the Over - 65 Retiree Plan. The IRO will timely notify you, in writing, that your request for external review is eligible and has been accepted for external review. This notice will in clude a statement that you may submit in writing to the assigned IRO additional information within 10 business days following the date of receipt of the notice, and that the IRO will be required to consider this additional information when conducting the external review. The IRO may, but is not required to, accept and consider additional information submitted after 10 business days. Within five (5) business days after the date of assignment of the IRO, the claims administrator will provide to the assigned I RO the documents and any information considered in making the claim denial or appeal denial. Failure by the claims administrator to timely provide the documents and information will not delay the IRO from conducting the external review. If the claims admi nistrator fails to timely provide the documents and information, the assigned IRO may terminate the external review and make a decision to reverse the claim denial or appeal denial. Within one (1) business day after making such a decision, the IRO will not ify you and the claims administrator. Within one (1) business day of receiving any information submitted by you, the assigned IRO will forward the information to the claims administrator. Upon receipt of any such information, the claims administrator may r econsider its claim denial or appeal denial that is the subject of the external review. Reconsideration by the claims administrator will not delay the external review. The external review may be terminated as a result of the reconsideration only if the cl aims administrator decides, upon completion of its reconsideration, to reverse its claim denial or appeal denial and provide coverage or payment. Within one (1) business day after making such a decision, the claims administrator must provide written notic e of its decision to you and the assigned IRO. The assigned IRO will terminate 89996073.1 44 its external review upon receipt of the notice from the claims administrator that the claims administrator has decided to reverse its claim denial or appeal denial. The IRO wil l review all of the information and documents timely received. In reaching a decision, the assigned IRO will review the claim de novo and not be bound by any decisions or conclusions reached during the claims administrator's internal claims and appeals pr ocess. In addition to the documents and information provided, the assigned IRO, to the extent the information or documents are available and the IRO considers them appropriate, will consider the following in reaching a decision: Your medical records. The a ttending health care professional's recommendation. Reports from appropriate health care professionals and other documents submitted by the claims administrator, you, or your treating provider. The terms of the Over -65 Retiree Plan to ensure that the IRO's decision is not contrary to the terms of the Over -65 Retiree Plan, unless the terms are inconsistent with applicable law. Appropriate practice guidelines, which must include applicable evidence -based standards and may include any other practice guidelines developed by the Federal government, national or professional medical societies, boards, and associations. Any applicable clinical review criteria developed and used by the claims administrator, unless the criteria are inconsistent with the terms of the O ver-65 Retiree Plan or with applicable law. The opinion of the IRO's clinical reviewer or reviewers after considering the information described above, to the extent the information or documents are available and the clinical reviewer or reviewers consider appropriate. The IRO will provide you and the claims administrator with written notice of the final external review decision within 45 days after the IRO receives the request for the external review. The notice of final external review decision will includ e the following information: A general description of the reason for the request for external review, including information sufficient to identify the claim (including the date or dates of service, the health care provider, the claim amount (if applicable) , the diagnosis code and its corresponding meaning, the treatment code and its corresponding meaning, and the reason for the previous denial). The date the IRO received the assignment to conduct the external review and the date of the IRO decision. Referen ces to the evidence or documentation, including the specific coverage provisions and evidence -based standards, considered in reaching its decision. A discussion of the principal reason or reasons for its decision, including the rationale for its decision and any evidence \u2014based standards that were relied on in making its decision. A statement that the determination is binding, except to the extent that other remedies may be available under State or Federal law to either you or the claims administrator. A statement that judicial review may be available to you. Current contact information, including phone number, for any applicable office of health insurance consumer assistance or ombudsman that may be available to assist you. After a final external review decision, the IRO will maintain records of all claims and notices associated with the external review process for six years. The IRO will make such records available for examination by you, the claims administrator, or State or Federal oversight agency upon request, except where such disclosure would violate State or Federal privacy laws. 89996073.1 45 Reversal of Decision Upon receipt of a notice of a final external review decision reversing the claim denial or appeal denial, the claim s administrator immediately must provide coverage or payment (including immediately authorizing or immediately paying benefits) for the claim. Expedited External Review Request for Expedited External Review You may make a request for an expedited exter nal review with the claims administrator at the time you receive either of the following: An claim denial that involves a medical condition for which the timeframe for completion of an expedited internal appeal would seriously jeopardize your life or healt h or would jeopardize your ability to regain maximum function, provided that you have already filed a request for an expedited internal appeal. An appeal denial that involves a medical condition for which the timeframe for completion of a standard external review would seriously jeopardize your life or health or would jeopardize your ability to regain maximum function, or if the appeal denial concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care item or service for which you received e mergency services, but you have not been discharged from a facility. Preliminary Review Immediately upon receipt of the request for expedited external review, the claims administrator will complete a preliminary review to determine whether the request mee ts the reviewability requirements set forth in the \"Standard External Review\" section above. The claims administrator will immediately send you a notice of its eligibility determination that meets the requirements set forth in the \"Standard External Review \" section above. Referral to Independent Review Organization Upon a determination that a request is eligible for external review following the preliminary review, the claims administrator will assign an IRO pursuant to the requirements set forth in the \"Standard External Review\" section above. The claims administr ator will provide or transmit all necessary documents and information considered in making the claim denial or appeal denial to the assigned IRO electronically or by telephone or facsimile or any other available expeditious method.

Box 4288 Scranton, PA 18505 If Medicare Advantage makes a coverage decision and you are not satisfied with this decision, you can \"appeal\" the decision. An appeal is a formal way of asking BCBS to review and change a coverage decision they have made. Consult your Evidence of Coverage handbook for more detaile d information. Level 1 Appeal - When you appeal a decision for the first time . In this appeal, BCBS review s the coverage decision BCBS made to check to see if they were following all of the rules properly. Your appeal is handled by different reviewers th an those who made the original unfavorable decision. When they have completed the review they give you their decision. Level 2 Appeal - If they say no to all or part of your Level 1 Appeal, you can go on to a Level 2 Appeal . This Appeal Level is conducted by an Independent Review O rganization (IRO) that is not connected to BCBS . (In some situations, your case will be automatically sent to the IRO for a Level 2 Appeal. If this happens, BCBS will let you know. In other situations, you will need to ask for a Level 2 Appeal.) Level 3 Appeal - If the Independent Review Organization \"upholds the decision\" you have the right to a Level 3 appeal. However, to make another appeal at Level 3, the dollar value of the claim you are requesting must meet a minimum amount. If the dollar value of the claim is too low, you cannot make 89996073.1 48 another appeal and the decision at Level 2 is final. The notice you get from the Independent Review Organization will tell you the dollar value that must be in dispute to continue with the appeals process. This level is handled by an Administrative Law Judge. More information about how claims and appeals are processed can be found in your Evidence of Coverage handbook . Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies These claims and appeals processes are provided in the hope that most disputes can be resolved. You or your covered spouse must follow and exhaust all the internal administrative remedies described above prior to bringing an action for benefits under the Over -65 Retiree P lan under Section 502(a) of ERISA. Limitations on Actions No legal action may be brought to recover under the Over -65 Retiree Plan after the expiration of one year following the date on which you received the final notice of denial of your health care app eal. If you do not bring an action within such one -year period, you will be barred from bringing an action under ERISA related to your claim. THIRD PARTY LIABILITY This provision modifies any coverage under the Over -65 Retiree Plan. Right to Reimbursem ent Sometimes, you or a covered family member may have a claim for a sickness or injury, such as from a car accident, that someone else is legally responsible to pay. The portion of the expense that the other party (which may be an individual, a company or an insurer) is responsible for paying is not considered an eligible expense under the Over -65 Retiree Plan. However, the Plan will pay benefits for a claim that someone else is responsible for paying if: the other person has not paid; and you (or your legal representative) agree in writing to reimburse the money promptly when the other person pays or another party (such as an insurance company) pays for him or her. You must reimburse the Plan from any recovery to the extent of benefits the Plan paid on your behalf, regardless of whether the payments you receive make you whole for your losses, illnesses and/or injuries or fully satisfy the judgment, settlement or underlying claim for damages. Notwithstanding any allocation or designation of your recovery (e.g., pain and suffering) made in a settlement agreement or court order, the Plan shall have a right of full recovery, in first priority, against any recovery. This right of reimbursement will apply whether or not the party who is responsible for the pay ment admits liability, whether or not the payments are itemized or allocated to medical expenses, and whether or not the covered individual has been made whole. If you make such an agreement and receive payment from the Plan, it is possible that you will incur costs, including attorney's fees, in trying to obtain payments from the responsible party. If you do incur such costs, you may then deduct a reasonable shar e of costs that you incur in obtaining payment from the responsible party from the amount that you owe the Plan, as determined by the Plan Administrator in the exercise of its sole discretion. Any settlement proceeds, assets collected from judgments and r ecoveries paid by a third party shall be held for the Plan, and the Plan's interest therein shall be protected to the same extent as if such proceeds or assets were held in trust for the benefit of the Plan, to the extent of the amount paid by the Plans an d subject to reimbursement to the Plan. By accepting benefits under the Plan, you agree that any amounts 89996073.1 49 you recover from a third party are assets of the Plan (up to the amount of benefits provided by the Plan on your behalf), that you will be a fiduciary of the Pla n with respect to those amounts, and that you will be responsible for repaying to the Plan any costs and fees (including reasonable attorney fees) that the Plan incurs to enforce its rights with respect to reimbursement of those amounts. You al so agree that, to the extent you have control over such assets, you will exercise all authorities consistent with the Plan's interest in such assets. If you do not repay the Plan all or a part of an amount that you have agreed to pay, that amount may be deducted from other benefits payable to you under the Plan after payments by or for the responsible person are made. Subrogation of the Plan In addition to the Over -65 Retiree Plan 's right to reimbursement, if the Plan pays benefits to you or a covered family member for a sickness or injury that another party is responsible for paying, the Plan will be subrogated to the amount of benefits it paid. This means that the Plan takes on the rights you or a covered family member ha ve to bring a lawsuit or make a claim against any person or insurer whose act or failure to act caused the sickness and injury from whom you could recover payment for the sickness or injury. You have the following obligations: To notify the Plan Administra tor of any responsible person or insurer that you may have a claim against, including an insurance company; To notify the Plan Administrator of any claims for damages made in connection with the sickness or injury; and To fully cooperate with the Plan Admi nistrator and the claims administrator in obtaining information, providing relevant documents, and signing any necessary forms. You will be required to sign a document that assigns to the Plan your right of payment from an insurer or other responsible part y, but only up to the amount that the Plan paid for the claim. If a covered family member is a minor, the Plan may require that a court appoint a legal representative to act on behalf of the minor. The Plan will place a lien against any responsible person , that person's insurer, and your insurer; and suspend payment of future benefits pending receipt of documents and forms it needs to act under this subrogation provision. If the Plan, DePaul, or you bring an action against the responsible person or insurer , the party bringing the action must provide written notice of it to the other parties by personal service or registered or certified mail. The Plan Administrator in its discretion will determine whether to exercise the Plan's subrogation rights. Subrogat ion and Reimbursement under the Medicare Advantage Option In addition to the general subrogation and reimbursement provisions described above, if you are enrolled in the Medicare Advantage option you may have other responsibilities with respect to benefits under the Over -65 Retiree Plan. You should refer to your Evidence of Coverage handbook for more information. ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE OVER -65 RETIREE PLAN Plan Administrator DePaul, as the Plan Administrator, has the sole and complete discretionary authority to determine eligibility for Over -65 Retiree Plan benefits and to construe the terms of the Over -65 Retiree Plan and the Plan, including the making of factual determinatio ns. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority to grant or deny benefits under the Over -65 Retiree Plan . Benefits under the Over -65 Retiree Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the applicant is entitled to 89996073.1 50 them. The decisions of the Plan Administrator shall be final and conclusive with respect to all questions relating to the Over -65 Retiree Plan . The Plan Administrator may delegate to other persons responsibilities for performing certain duties of the Plan Administrator under the terms of the Over -65 Retiree Plan and the Plan and may seek such expert advice as the Plan Administrator deems reasonably necessary with respect to the Over -65 Retiree Plan and the Plan . The Plan Administrator shall be entitled to rely upon the information and advice furnished by such delegates and experts, unless actually knowing such information and advice to be inaccurate or unlawful. The Plan Administrator may adopt uniform rules for the administration of the plan f rom time to time, as it deems necessary or appropriate. Facility of Payment If you are under a legal disability, or in the opinion of the Plan Administrator are in any way incapacitated so as to be unable to manage your financial affairs, the Plan Adminis trator may direct the claims administrator to make payments or distributions to: the covered person's legal representative; or until a claim is made by a conservator or other person legally charged with the care of the person, to a relative or friend of su ch person for such person's benefit. Or, the Plan Administrator may direct payments or distributions for the benefit of the covered person in any manner that is consistent with the provisions of the Over -65 Retiree Plan . Any payments so made will be a fu ll and complete discharge of any liability for such payment under the Over -65 Retiree Plan. Benefits Not Transferable Except as otherwise permitted by the Plan Administrator to assign benefits to providers, or as may be required by a qualified medical chi ld support order, or applicable tax withholding laws, or pursuant to an agreement between you and DePaul, your benefits under the Over -65 Retiree Plan are not in any way subject to your or your spouse's debts and may not be voluntarily sold, transferred, a lienated or assigned. Recovery of Benefits If you or a covered spouse receives a benefit payment under the Over -65 Retiree Plan that is in excess of the benefit payment that should have been made, the Plan Administrator has the right to recover the amount of the excess. The Plan Administrator may, however, at its option, direct the claims administrator or trustee to deduct the amount of the excess from any subsequent benefits payable under the Over -65 Retiree Plan to or for the benefit of you or your cove red spouse. Information to be Furnished You must furnish DePaul, the Plan Administrator, the insurance companies and the claims administrators with the information they consider necessary or desirable to administer the Over -65 Retiree Plan . If you make a fraudulent misstatement or omission of fact in an enrollment form or a claim for benefits under the Over -65 Retiree Plan , it may be used to deny claims for benefits under the Over -65 Retiree Plan . Physical Exam The Plan Administrator, at its own expense, has the right and opportunity to have the person whose injury or sickness is the basis of a claim, examined by a physician designated by it, when and as often as it may reasonably require while a claim is pending under the Over -65 Retiree Plan. 89996073.1 51 Governing Law The Over -65 Retiree Plan shall be governed by the laws of Illinois, to the extent not superseded by federal law. If any part of any program is determined to be invalid or illegal for any reason, the remaining provisions of the Over -65 Retiree Plan shall be applied as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been a part of the Over -65 Retiree Plan . STATEMENT OF YOUR RIGHTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW As a participant in the Over -65 Retiree Plan, you are entitled to certain rights an d protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA provides that all participants shall be entitled to: Receive Information about Your Plan and Benefits Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office and a t other specified locations, such as worksites, all documents governing the Over -65 Retiree Plan, including insurance contracts, and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public D isclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries In addition to creating rights for Over -65 Retiree Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon people who are responsible for the operation of the Over -65 Retiree Plan. The people who operate the Over -65 Retiree Plan, called plan fiduciaries , have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a benefi t or exercising your rights under ERISA. Enforcing Your Rights If your claim for a benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within a certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of Plan documents or the latest annual report from the Over -65 Retiree Plan and do not rec eive them within 30 days, you may file suite in a Federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or Federal court. In addition, if you disagree with the Over -65 Retiree Plan's decisi on or lack thereof 89996073.1 52 concerning the qualified status of a medical child support order, you may file suit in Federal court. If it should happen that Over -65 Retiree Plan fiduciaries misuse the plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting y our rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a Federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay th ese costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. Assistance with Your Questions If you have any questions about the Over -65 Retiree Plan, you should contact the Plan A dministrator.
