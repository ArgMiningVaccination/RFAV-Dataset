Dr. Tellier earned her Bachelor of Science in Biology from Arizona State University (ASU). While attending ASU, she began exploring alternative medicine while working in a research lab that studied the ability to fight cancer using botanical constituents. This experience increased her curiosity in the use of natural remedies in fighting common medical conditions, which drove her to explore further the philosophy of alternative medicine. Dr. Tellier then realized her future was about to take another path, the \"Natural-Path.\" While receiving her training at SCNM, Dr. Tellier worked with physicians trained in each Naturopathic modality. She discovered her desire was in being able to treat the entire family, but realized she wanted to continue her education in pediatrics and women's medicine. Upon completion of her education at SCNM, Dr. Tellier continued her training in the private office of Dr. Farra Swan, ND, CPM. While working with Dr. Swan, Dr. Tellier found passion while working with families with reproductive health, childbirth and pediatric care. Dr. Tellier completed a one month internship at Casa de Nacimiento (CASA), a birthing center, located in El Paso, Texas. At CASA she was immerged into midwifery care which included prenatal visits, labor and delivery, post-partum care and pediatric care. Dr. Tellier sat for her midwifery certification. Dr Tellier began clinical practice in 2009 in her private family practice. Being a primary care focused provider she has found that her patients have been her best teachers. Dr. Tellier also shares with her patients experiences she has gleaned from her own family's journey with lyme disease and mold sickness. When her family's health began to decline after water damage to their home, Dr. Tellier began looking further into environmentally caused illnesses like mold, heavy metals, toxic chemicals, Epstein bar virus, lyme, bartonella, babesia and other chronic infections. She found that so many of her patients felt so sick and have seen specialist after specialist with no known cause for their disease. Dr. Tellier understands that for many of these patients you have to really listen to their life long experiences and exposures and investigate further with testing that may seem more out of the box to conventional medicine. Dr. Tellier utilizes botanical medicines, vitamins/minerals/amino acids, homeopathy, physical manipulation, acupuncture, IV therapy, hydrotherapy, nutritional supplements, and bio-identical hormones, to help address the needs of her patients. To evaluate the individual needs of her patients she may order specialty labs, which include hormone level assessments, food allergy testing, environmental toxin levels, advanced cholesterol and cardiac disease profiles, and body nutrient stores. Dr. Tellier has extensive training in women's health, gastrointestinal disorders, endocrine dysfunction, detoxification methods, pediatric wellness and lifestyle counseling. Dr. Tellier treats the whole person with therapies that are the least invasive and most cost effective. She looks for the cause of each individual person's disease, and uses therapies that are curative, rather than just symptomatic relief. She believes that one's health must address the mind, body and spirit. She promotes balance and moderation within her patients, and hopes that with proper healing, her patients may return to enjoying their lives. Most of all, Dr. Tellier expresses the importance of teaching our children healthy eating and lifestyle habits so that they may avoid the epidemic of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and drug addictions. When Dr. Tellier is away from the office, she enjoys spending time with her husband, two children and two dogs. She loves the outdoors and any chance that she gets you will find her hiking, practicing yoga, camping, boating, swimming or traveling. Dr. Lynnea Felton, N.M.D. A native of Buffalo, NY, Dr. Felton received her Bachelor's of Science in Biology from Niagara University. While studying there, she conducted a thesis experiment on the effects of cervical cancer cells after treatment with Curcuma longa and light activated vitamin D, the herb that causes the yellow coloring of turmeric. This, however, was not where her journey to discover a more alternative way of treatment started. After struggling through childhood with chronic infections, her parents were inspired to seek out an alternative. This eventually lead the family to discover naturopathic medicine, and Dr. Felton's favorite naturopathic principle of \"Treat the Cause\". Removing the source of irritation that caused chronic inflammation leading to disease with simple diet changes lead to complete resolution of symptoms. Since then, she's been inspired to find the cause of disease in others so they too can experience freedom from disease. Since the discovery of how impactful naturopathic medicine has been on her life, Dr. Felton has also seen how effective a natural approach to medicine is for her family, friends, and patients. She truly enjoys the moment when a patient has a breakthrough in the cause of their symptoms or begins thinking about their heath in a more comprehensive way. The human body is extraordinarily complex and causation of disease may not have a simple answer. However, through extensive intake and testing, Dr. Felton's patients work with her as a team to best discover treatment plans that best fit into their lifestyle, finances, and body chemistry to reach their health goals. After graduating from Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine (SCNM) in Tempe, AZ, she went on to complete a general medicine residency at the SCNM Medical Center. She enjoyed teaching clinical students on how to incorporate the naturopathic principles to treat every patient and provide treatment plans that easily integrate into patient's lifestyles. One very common lesson was to act as a detective, not a scribe when with a patient- ask unexpected questions and dig deep. Dr. Felton is a primary care physician in the state of Arizona and regularly treats patients of all ages, from birth to end of life. She routinely sees pediatric acute sick visits, pediatric wellness exams, well woman exams, and general physicals. Her specialty focus is treatment of infertility, menstrual irregularities, and gastrointestinal concerns through the use of proper nutrition, acupuncture, botanical medicine, IV therapy, and repletion of nutrients through use of vitamin and mineral supplementation. Through gentle and individualized treatment, she happily treats the whole family to achieve wellness. In her free time, you can find Dr. Felton spending time with her family outside, traveling to new places, discovering new ways to bake healthy treats, and dancing with her local ballet school.
