Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause disease in animals and humans Usually respiratory disease; sometimes GI involvement Four common coronaviruses circulate globally and cause mild respiratory illness (~30% of common colds) - 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1 Three more severe coronaviruses: SARS (2002- 2003) MERS (2012) The 'novel coronavirus' first detected in China in November and December 2019 SARS CoV -2 What is COVID-19? Coronavirus disease 2019 or ' COVID -19' is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus now known as SARS CoV -2 Symptoms of COVID- 19 include: Fever Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Chills Sometimes: Muscle aches and pains Headache Sore throat New loss of taste or smell Diarrhea Not everyone will have symptoms does the virus spread? Mostly spread person to person via respiratory droplets (droplet transmission) Coughing; surfaces contaminated with droplets 6 feet People with mild or no symptoms can still be infectious (asymptomatic or pre- symptomatic transmission) Covid -19 Transmission - Infographic , World Heart Federation How long does the virus survive on surfaces? The virus may live on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days This will depend on the type of surface, temperature, humidity, etc. If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant, then wash or clean your hands High -touch surfaces should be cleaned regularly How long does it take to get sick after being exposed to COVID -19? Incubation Period : The time between when someone is infected with the virus and when they start having symptoms Average: 5 days Range: 1- 14 Days Help elders and people at high risk tobe able to stay at home and away fromill peopleWho is most at risk for COVID-19?

Closures in Philadelphia were only enacted once the virus had spread. The first cases in St. Louis were reported in early October, with measures to contain the spread enacted two days later. This resulted in a slower spread and lower mortality rate.

Higher mortality rates In the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Native populations across 12 states in the U.S. had 4 times higher mortality rates compared to other populations. 1918 Influenza pandemic: Mortality rates among American Indian populations were 4 times higher than rates in larger U.S. cities. 1918 Influenza pandemic: Across the U.S. and other countries, there were increased mortality rates in indigenous populations, compared to other populations Higher hospitalization rates 2009 H1N1 pandemic: American Indians in the Southwest U.S., and particularly children under 5 years, had higher hospitalization rates during the H1N1 pandemic than other populations in the U.S Increased role of risk factors: 2009 H1N1 pandemic: Diabetes among adults and asthma among children were independent risk factors for hospitalization with H1N1 Key issues in context Limited testing availability Limited hospital capacity , especially in areas with high COVID -19 case counts Water insecurity and challenges with frequent hand washing Prevalence of underlying conditions , like diabetes, that make people higher risk for COVID -19 complications Multi -generational homes could put elders at greater risk Community health workers have been critical in stopping past outbreaks In the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the CHW networks helped engage communities to stop the spread. CHWs acted as community -level educators, organizers, and mobilizers and made th e r esponse efforts more effectiv e. C HWs conducted community surveillance activities and reported suspected Ebola cases t o p ublic health authorities . In the 2015 Zika outbreak in South America , CHWS helped distribute culturally -appropriate health information and supplies. Reference: Boyce and Katz, 2019 Today 's COVID -19 community health representatives could become our epidemic response corps of the future - always ready to help us fight the next epidemic. Prevent Detect Treat Recover 1. Prevent Organize and carry out social media campaigns to promote social distancing and advocate for timely policies. Encourage strategies in their communities and online to promote mental and physical health and resilience . Deliver food and medications to the elderly and other vulnerable residents. Make masks at home and donate them to supplement the stock of personal protective equipment at local hospitals. 2. Detect Learn the signs and symptoms of COVID -19 and help staff hotlines run by hospitals and public health departments to answer questions from the public. Refer possible COVID -19 patients to their nearest testing center and organize transportation. Today 's COVID -19 community health representatives could become our epidemic response corps of the future (cont'd) 3. Treat Call people with COVID -19 who are in self -isolation with mild symptoms, and monitor them for worsening symptoms. Provide moral support and organize food deliveries for people with COVID -19 at home. Monitor patients for worsening symptoms and support rapid referral of people who require hospitalization with nurse care team. With public health officers, support contact tracing , symptom reporting, and monitoring of contacts of COVID-19 patients. Ensure access to testing and treatment for people who develop signs and symptoms. Help hospitals and non -profits raise funds for the most vulnerable. Today 's COVID -19 community health representatives could become our epidemic response corps of the future (cont'd) 4. Recover Assist with the coordination to support Tribal and urban communities with health care services (e.g., medical supplies, prescriptions, staffing, etc.) Support the coordination of health, social, and counseling services (e.g. development of toolkits, comprehensive resource hub, promoting self -care for staff and community members, elder mental health, etc.) Assist in the development of recovery timeframe to set bench marks, evaluate and monitor outcomes . (Tribal Epi centers, State Health Departments, CHR Data Mart). Share best practices (e.g., develop a blue print of crisis/risk communication for future use). Partner with health care system to ensure patients resume health care appointments with their providers. Support local economic recovery (e.g., Buy Indian support contracts, Indian businesses and vendors).
