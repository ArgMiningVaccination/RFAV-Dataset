Although with increased vaccination the overall risk of COVID-19 transmission and serious consequences has been significantly diminished, it will continue to circulate and continue to present a hazard in the workplace for years to come. And while the recent emphasis has rightfully been on COVID-19, there are other communicable diseases which can have significant impacts in the workplace and can be effectively controlled by measur es like those which have proved effective against COVID-19. This guide is written to assist empl oyers in addressing the ongoing hazard pr esented by communicable disease in the workplace. This includes baseline measu res to address the background risk of communicable disease, as well as additional measur es that can be implemented in times of elevated communicable disease risk in the community as a whole or in a specific workplace. It is focused primarily on respiratory illnesses, but many of the principles can be equally applied to other communicable diseases. Note that this guide is not intended for workplaces such as health care and long- term care that, though they have a higher risk of communicable disease transmission, already have existing infection prevention and control programs in place to mitigate the risk. What is communicable disease? A communicable disease is any illness caused by an infectious agent or its toxic product that occurs through the transmission of an infectious agent from one person to anothe r. The mode of transmission v aries from one infectious agent to another , and there can sometimes be multiple routes for a given agent. Direct transmission occurs via physical contact or by dr oplets. Indirect transmission can be through longer range airborne spread, 1 novascotia.ca/co ronavirus via another substance or 'vehicle' such as water or blood and body fluids, or through an insect 'vector' such as mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks. This guide is intended to address those communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, seasonal influenza and norovirus, that are spread through direct contact, droplet or airborne spread. Depending on the natur e of the work environment, some workplaces may also need to consider vehicle or vector borne communicable disease such as Hepatitis B (via blood and body fluids) or Lyme Disease (via tick bites). Legislation Under Section 13 (1)(a) of the Nova Scotia Occupational Health and Safety Act., the empl oyer is obligated to take every reasonable precaution to ensu re the health and safety of persons at or near the workplace. This includes prevention efforts to eliminate or minimi ze the haza rd presented by communicable disease in your workplace. Fundamentall y, communicable disease in the workplace can be addressed by the same process as for other hazar ds in the workplace; identify the hazar d, assess the risk, and implement controls. If you already have a Workplace COVID-19 Prevention Plan, it can serve as the basis for this process. Similarly , under Section 17 (1)(a) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, every empl oyee, is obligated to take every reasonable precaution in the circumstances to protect the empl oyee's own health and safety and that of other persons at or near the workplace. In acco rdance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act, identification of hazar ds to health and safety, and effective systems to respond to them, must be performed in cooperation with the Joint Occupational Health and Safety Committee (Section 31(a)) or the Health and Safety Representati ve (Section 33(6)(a) ). In addition, many of the control measu res discussed below have specific requirements in the Occupational Health and Safety Act and the various Regulations. These are noted where applicable. 2 novascotia.ca/co ronavirus Communicable disease prevention 1. Baseline prevention measures For all communicable disease, there are a range of baseline measur es that should be implemented in all workplaces. Outside of periods of increased communicable disease activity , these measur es may be the only ones required in everyday operations. Provide hand -hygiene facilities with appropriate supplies. This may include providing hand- sanitizing supplies to supplement regular hand washing facilities. (See Section 20 of the Occupational Safety General Regulations) Use signage and policies to remind people to wash their hands regularly and use cough/sneez e etiquette (cough/sneez e into sleeve or elbow). Establish a reasonable cleaning and disinfection schedule, particularly with high traffic areas, high contact surfaces and wash rooms. Provide accessible cleaning and disinfecting products to allow empl oyees and others at the workplace to clean commonly used surfaces themsel ves. Ensu re workers know how to use cleaning and disinfection products safely (See the Workplace Haza rdous Materials Information System [WHMIS] Regulations) Ensu re ventilation systems are adequate and operating as designed. (See Section 15 of the Occupational Safety General Regulations) As much as possible, increase the amount of fresh outside air supplied to the workplace. Implement policies to address barriers/pr ovide suppo rt to staff so that they can avoid being in the workplace when they have symptoms that could mean they are infectious to others (e.g. fever and cough, vomiting and/or diarrhea). Monitor Public Health notices for any additional measur es required during periods of increased communicable disease activity in the community at large or in specific locations. 3 novascotia.ca/co ronavirus 2. Assess the hazard Haza rd assessment involves taking a careful look at the workplace to determine what potential harms exist for workers. The key points to be addressed in the hazar d assessment for communicable disease are: The risk of exposure , and potential for infectio n, to communicable disease; and Potential increased absenteeism because of communicable disease, and any resulting risks introduced by staff shortages. The risk of exposure will vary based on the specific communicable disease in question, and due to the unique aspects of each individual workplace. Some points to consider in your assessment include: How do workers interact with each other, as well as suppliers, clients, customers, anyone else at the workplace. Workplace layout. Is there unnecessar y crowding or unintentional gathering of people? Business type and the services provided. Workplace location and environment. How much travel is required for work, especially internationally or to locations with known communicable disease risk. How workers perform their job duties. Are there workers (or others at the workplace) who may be more vulnerable to the effects of a communicable disease. Is there a vaccine available for the communicable disease in question? Are workers vaccinated? This list is not exhausti ve, so consider any unique aspects of your workplace and how they may affect the risk of communicable disease. Note that some of these measu res may raise privacy and confidentiality issues. Seek expe rt advice on these issues as necessa ry. Increased absenteeism is best evaluated by considering the jobs and processors that may be more hazar dous if there are fewer workers to perform those tasks, or when any specially trained or competent workers who normally perform these tasks are not available due to increased workplace absence related to communicable disease. 4 novascotia.ca/co ronavirus 3. Implement controls Once the hazard assessment is complete, the next step is to implement controls to address the risks of exposure identified in the hazard assessment. In many circumstances, the controls noted in BASELINE PREVENTION MEASURES abov e will be sufficient. Howev er, there may be aspects of the work that you do or the types of communicable diseases that could be encountered which require additional control measures. In addition, at times of elevated communicable disease activity in the community in general or specifically in the workplace, additional levels of control may be required. Whenever practicable, the most effective or highest level of control should be used to reduce the risk of exposure to communicable disease. Most likely, you will use a combination of control strategies to address the haza rds identified. There may also be situations where other authorities, either regulatory or indust ry specific standards, recommend a different combination or hierarchy of controls in particular circumstances. A range of potential controls to consider under the circumstances described abov e are given in the tables below. The list of controls is not prescriptive but is provided as a range of possibilities from which to choose the best options for controlling communicable diseases in your workplace. The list is also not exhausti ve; you ma y find other control measu res that work better in your unique circumstances. Elimination Working remotely If possible, allow employees to work from home during times of increased communicable disease activity or if they are f eeling unwell themsel ves. Employ ee self-assessment Support employees so they are able to not attend work if they are sick. Limit unnecessa ry gatherings Make increased use of virtual meeting options when possible. Limit non-essential workplace visits by all parties. 5 novascotia.ca/co ronavirus Substitution Haza rd substitution is a control strategy in which a material or process is replaced with another that is less hazar dous. This is typically not applicable for communicable disease hazards. Engineering controls Physical barriers Use protecti ve barriers in situations where there is frequent interaction with multiple people, or where employees are working side by side for extended periods of time. Barriers should be constructed with a hard material that does not allow liquid to penetrate or air to pass through (i.e. non-porous) and that is easily cleanable. Partitions need to be large and high enough to extend well beyond the breathing zone of users (bubble with a radius of 30 cm (12 inches) around the nose and mouth). Ventilation See BASELINE PREVEN TION MEASURES Administrative controls Sick policy See BASELINE PREVEN TION MEASURES Distancing Consider restructuring physical layouts to allow greater distancing between people. Masks Even when non-medical masks ar e no longer mandated these may still be used in some circumstances: - Some people may continue to wear a nonmedical mask. This choice should be respected. - During times of seasonal communicable illness, namely November -March, or other times of elevated risk, masking may be required in the workplace to minimi ze risk of transmission. - Masks may also be worn by an individual when they are unwell; this will help minimi ze the risk of transmission. 6 novascotia.ca/co ronavirus Crowding Minimi ze crowded areas for staff, including break and lunchr ooms. Minimi ze crowding for public in waiting areas. Signage Post appropriate signage to remind everyone to: - Not to enter a workplace if sick. - Wear a mask if exhibiting any respira tory symp toms. - Practice good hand and respira tory hygiene. - Any other specific control measu res established in the workplace. Control movement Direct traffic flow with the use of signage, floor decals, or other means. Where layout and space allow, establish separate entrances, and exits, particularly in busy areas. Cleaning See BASELINE PREVEN TION MEASURES Increase cleaning/disinf ection schedules if necessa ry. Hand hygiene See BASELINE PREVEN TION MEASURES Vaccination Where an effective vaccine exists for a communicable disease, employers should encourage their employees to get vaccinated. In some situations, depending on the workplace and the communicable disease in question, vaccination policies may be appropriate. 7 novascotia.ca/co ronavirus Personal protecti ve equipment (PPE) Personal protecti ve equipment such as face shields, gloves and respirators may be required depending on the work environment and the communicable disease under consideration. Note that a non-medical mask is not conside red PPE, as it is intended primarily to protect others, not yourself. Face shields and goggles Face shields or goggles maybe used in situations where a splash could result in communicable disease transmission. Gloves Gloves can provide an important barrier to contact transmission for some communicable disease Respira tors Some communicable diseases may require use of appropriately selected respira tory protection. See Section 13 of the Occupational Safety General Regulations and CSA standar d CSA Z94.4, \"Selection, Use, and Care of Respirat ors\" for information on selection, maintenance, testing and training requirements. Medical masks Some workplaces may require use of medical masks due to presence of individuals at high risk of communicable disease. 4. Communicate Ensu re everyone at the workplace is aware of the control measur es in place for managing communicable disease. They must be informed of the steps being taken to mitigate the risk of communicable disease in the workplace, as well as any specific measur es they must take as a result. If empl oyees are concerned about hazar ds in their workplace then they should report to their supe rvisor. If the matter is not remedied to their satisfaction, they must report it to their Joint Occupational Health and Safety Committee (JOHS C) / representati ve. 8 novascotia.ca/co ronavirus 5. Evaluate and update The measur es being taken should be re-evaluated regularly to ensure it is adequately addressing the risk of communicable disease in the workplace. This can involve: Issues and concerns noted as part of workplace inspections or through the Joint Occupational Health and Safety Committee / Health and Safety Representati ve.
