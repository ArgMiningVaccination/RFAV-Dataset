Hearing your answers may help them feel more confident about getting vaccinated.Quick Answers for Healthcare Professionals to Common Questions People May Ask About COVID-19 Vaccines COVIDVACCINE.MT.GOVSHOULD I GET VACCINATED FOR COVID-19? I strongly recommend you get vaccinated. The vaccine will help protect you from getting COVID-19. If you still get infected after you get vaccinated, the vaccine may prevent serious illness. By getting vaccinated, you can also help protect people around you. CAN THE VACCINE GIVE ME COVID-19? No. None of the COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized for use or in development in the United States use the live virus that causes COVID-19. However, it typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity after vaccination. That means it's possible you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and get sick. IF I ALREADY HAD COVID-19 AND RECOVERED, DO I STILL NEED TO GET VACCINATED? Yes. CDC recommends that you get vaccinated even if you have already had COVID-19, because you can catch it more than once. While you may have some short- term antibody protection after recovering from COVID-19, we don't know how long this protection will last.CAN MY CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 16 GET VACCINATED FOR COVID-19? No. More studies need to be conducted before COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for children younger than age 16. IS IT SAFE TO GET A COVID-19 VACCINE IF I HAVE AN UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION? Yes. COVID-19 vaccination is especially important for people with underlying health problems like heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, and obesity. People with these conditions are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19. IS IT BETTER TO GET NATURAL IMMUNITY TO COVID-19 RATHER THAN IMMUNITY FROM A VACCINE? No. While you may have some short-term antibody protection after recovering from COVID-19, we don't know how long this protection lasts. Vaccination is the best protection, and it is safe. People who get COVID-19 can have serious illnesses, and some have debilitating symptoms that persist for months.1 4 25 36COVID-19COVID-19Quick Answers for Healthcare Professionals to Common Questions People May Ask About COVID-19 Vaccines COVIDVACCINE.MT.GOVHOW MANY SHOTS OF COVID-19 VACCINE WILL BE NEEDED? This depends on which vaccine you received. With both COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, you will need two shots to get the most protection. The timing between your first and second shot depends on which vaccine you received. Pfizer-BioNTech doses should be given 3 weeks (21 days) apart. Moderna doses should be given 1 month (28 days) apart. These products are not interchangeable with other COVID-19 vaccine products. Both doses of the series should be completed with the same product. You should get your second shot as close to the recommended 3-week or 1-month interval as possible. However, your second dose may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose, if necessary. You should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval. If you have received the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson), you do not need a second shot. All people for whom vaccination is indicated should receive one dose.WHICH IS THE BEST VACCINE FOR ME? The best COVID-19 vaccine is the vaccine that is available to you. The CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) do not have a stated preference between the available vaccines. Each vaccine is equally effective at preventing serious illness and death. WILL THE SHOT HURT OR MAKE ME SICK? There may be side effects, but they should go away within a few days. Possible side effects include a sore arm, headache, fever, or body aches. This does not mean you have COVID-19. Side effects are signs that the vaccine is working to build immunity. If they don't go away in a week, or you have more serious symptoms, call your doctor. ARE THERE LONG-TERM SIDE EFFECTS FROM COVID-19 VACCINE? Because all COVID-19 vaccines are new, it will take more time and more people getting vaccinated to learn about very rare or possible long-term side effects. The good news is, at least 8 weeks' worth of safety data were gathered in the clinical trials for all the authorized vaccines, and it's unusual for vaccine side effects to appear more than 8 weeks after vaccination.7 8 9 10COVID-19COVID-19Quick Answers for Healthcare Professionals to Common Questions People May Ask About COVID-19 Vaccines COVIDVACCINE.MT.GOVHOW DO I KNOW IF COVID-19 VACCINE IS SAFE? All COVID-19 vaccines were tested in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people to make sure they meet safety standards and protect adults of different ages, races, and ethnicities. There were no serious safety concerns. CDC and the FDA will keep monitoring the vaccines to look for safety issues after they are authorized and in use.HOW ARE PROBLEMS OR BAD REACTIONS REPORTED AFTER GETTING A COVID-19 VACCINE? All recipients who receive the vaccine are encouraged to enroll in v-safe. This is a CDC smartphone-based tool you can use to tell CDC if you have any side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine. If you report serious side effects, someone from CDC will call you to follow-up. For more information, please visit www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/ vaccines/safety/vsafe.html Also, vaccination providers are required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to report certain and significant adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).11 12 "}
