Your body replaces the donated plasma within 24 to 48 hours. This means that if you donate on Monday, you can donate again on Wednesday. So, drink plenty of water following donations to help your body replace fluids. If you want to permanently switch the days that you donate, that is not a problem. Most people wait a full seven-days in-between weekly schedules to guarantee they can select any new days they prefer to avoid any issues. Contact your local donation center staff to discuss the easiest way to change your schedule. "}
