The Health Situation . Unlike many other countries in Latin America, Guatemala is only at the beginning of the demographic and epidemiological transition. The population is young, is growing rapidly, and is still primarily rural. Life expectancy in Guatemala (at 65 years) is the lowest in Central America, 12 years less than in Costa Rica. Infant mortality (45 per thousand) is the highest in Central America. Guatemala has the highest prevalence of chronically malnourished children in Latin America (44 percent). The prevalence of contraceptive use (27 percent) i s the second lowest in Latin America. The total fertility rate (five children per woman) is the highest in Latin America. In December 2000, 4,000 cases of AIDS were officially recognized in Guatemala, with possible under -estimation [check] of 50 percent. O ver time, the proportion of women infected by the virus has increased significantly, and the increase in infected women of reproductive age implies that there is also a higher probability of mother's transmitting the virus to their children. In addition, a closer look at demographic and health indicators reveals the existence of large inequalities in health performance across geographic areas and socioeconomic groups. The poor, people who live in rural areas, and the indigenous population have worse health outcomes than do the non -poor, people who live in urban areas, and the non - indigenous population. While not complete in terms of coverage of health outcomes issues, the Guatemalan Living Standard Measurement Survey (ENCOVI) is unique in terms of its repre sentative sample and its data on other themes (as it is a multi -topic survey) and on poverty variables. The Health Supply . As in most of Latin American countries, the major actors in Guatemala's health sector are the Ministry of Public Health and Social As sistance (MPSAS), the Guatemalan Social Security Institute (IGSS), the private for -profit sector, and private voluntary organizations. Neither the public nor the private sector is providing adequate health services to the population, which has limited cont act with both the public and private delivery system. Overall, only 11 percent of the Guatemalan population have access to health services, based on the World Health Organization's definition of distance to a health facility measured in terms of traveling time. The Integrated System for Health Care ( Sistema Integrado Atencion de Salud ) or SIAS, which the government introduced in 1997, aims to extend basic services to impoverished indigenous populations who live in rural hamlets with little or no access to health services. The SIAS does this by contracting NGOs both to provide and administer health care services. Preliminary evidence indicates that immunization coverage rates have increased since the introduction of SIAS, as has the monitoring of normal pre gnancies by medically trained health specialists. The combination of poor health indicators and low rates of utilization of public health facilities suggest that the type, quantity, and quality of the services being provided by the government do not match what is needed to improve health indicators or what is demanded by the public. Three demographic features of the population further complicate the process of increasing access to and the quality of health services. First, a large percentage of the populati on is indigenous (43 percent) belonging to more than twenty different Mayan language groups. The indigenous population, which has traditionally had the worst socioeconomic indicators, tends to live in remote rural areas, to lack access to public services, and to experience discrimination. Second, a large number of workers migrate during the year from the western highlands to southern 3plantations with a detrimental effect on their health. In general, the migrants have no (or limited) access to health service s. The precarious conditions of life (in particular, workers' inadequate houses, which often lack basic services) and of work (such as exposure to pesticides and unsafe machinery) favor the transmission of diseases and increase the risk of accidents . Malnu trition, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, and on -the-job accidents are among the most important risks to the health of migrants. In addition, the high incidence of prostitution in the fincas , especially in the area of Escuintila, increases the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS. Alcoholism is also an important cause of morbidity for the migrant population. Third, several thousand people have been displaced as a result of internal strife. The majority of those who returned to Guatemala resettled in the most remote areas, where they are now living in precarious conditions with limited access to basic services. The Demand for Health Care . Public health facilities tend to be underutilized. If they can afford it, Guatemalan pe ople prefer to use private facilities that provide health care services. Only the poor, people who live in rural areas, and the indigenous population use public health facilities more often than private facilities. The proportion of individuals who are tre ated by doctors varies significantly by consumption quintiles (from 14 percent of the poorest to almost 60 percent of the richest). Poor and extremely poor individuals often rely on assistance from other members of the household or on self -medication. The type and quality of prenatal care and assistance during birth are very important factors for the health of mothers and their children and are, therefore, important elements in evaluating the health conditions of a given country. Almost 80 percent of women with children surveyed by ENCOVI had a prenatal visit in Guatemala, a proportion that reaches almost 90 percent for women in the highest consumption quintile and falls to 66 percent for women in the lowest consumption quintile. More than a quarter of women in rural areas had no prenatal check. The corresponding figure is more than halved in urban areas (13 percent). There is also an important difference among different socioeconomic groups in the type of personnel who provide assistance during pregnancy. . Almost 90 percent of the richest women receive assistance from doctors, while the corresponding figure is only 20 percent for the poorest women who, in the majority of the cases, are assisted by midwives. Twice as many women in urban areas as in rural are as are visited by a doctor (78 percent versus 35 percent). The same pattern prevails between non - indigenous and indigenous women. Health Financing . In the late 1990s, Guatemala had the second lowest per capita public spending on health in Latin America. T he majority of public resources (about 80 percent) are allocated for current activities. The proportion of external financing is very low (14 percent of total) and is mostly in forms of grants. The distribution of public spending on health (net of cost rec overy from the patients) is skewed towards people in the higher quintiles, who benefit most from costly visits in public hospitals located in urban areas. Richer people can devote more of their private resources to taking care of their health, a factor tha t helps to explain the inequality observed across socioeconomic groups. People in the highest consumption quintile spend, on average, 30 times more than people in the poorest quintile spend on their health. Recommendations . Guatemala's poor health indicato rs are due, in part, to problems that are outside of the control of public health authorities and not likely to be solved in the short run. These problems include: (i) widespread poverty due to limited household resource availability; (ii) poor environment al conditions; (iii) the limited availability of private sector providers of an adequate quality; and (iv) a general lack of knowledge about the benefits of modern medicine, especially among the indigenous population. Changing these underlying factors will require 4effective economic programs to combat poverty (focused mostly on those rural areas with a large indigenous population) and expanded educational investments. Nevertheless, there are some actions that the government can and should take in the short - and medium -turn to improve health indicators and reduce inequality among areas and socioeconomic groups. The relative youth of the Guatemalan population means that, for the foreseeable future, the major problems confronting the health sector will be those of the young instead of the old. The widespread poverty in the country means that the government's short -term priorities should be to combat the infectious and parasitic diseases associated with poverty, which are still more prevalent than non -communicabl e diseases. Increasing knowledge and access to effective family planning methods, especially in rural areas and among the poor and the indigenous population, would both reduce population growth and improve reproductive and child health indicators. Given th e limited resources currently assigned to health, the government should ensure that the planned increase in resources to the health sector does indeed materialize. The program to extend coverage of basic health services should be evaluated carefully, and t he program should either be scaled -up or redesigned depending on the results of that evaluation. The frequency of blood transfusion as a cause of AIDS infection makes it essential to reform the national system of blood control. In the medium -term, the gov ernment should attempt to mobilize additional resources for health and should take additional steps to improve the efficiency and quality of services offered. Some ways to do this include: (i) introducing a system of referral and counter -referral; (ii) ch arging IGGS beneficiaries for services they receive in MSPAS facilities; (iii) allowing non -IGGS population to use IGGS facilities and charging the client, rather than MSPAS, for the use; and (iv) considering contracting out certain services within IGGS an d MSPAS to private services (in addition to those contracted to NGOs to expand coverage of basic health care). As the population ages and the epidemiological transition progresses, more resources should be allocated to attempts to cure and prevent non -comm unicable and degenerative diseases. In addition, two policy options are available to make public spending more progressive. The first is to move public resources away from hospitals towards community centers, health posts, and health centers (in other word s, increasing the share of resources devoted to primary health care) . The second is to introduce cost recovery mechanisms that charge different fees according to each user's income. The current policy of providing services free -of-charge in all type of pub lic facilities benefits the rich more the poor, who tend to attend community centers, health posts, and health centers where visits cost less in terms of both time and money . Increasing resources devoted to the health sector is a key recommendation because , in this way, more can be spent on preventive and primary care to improve basic services without having to reduce the absolute amount of resources available to hospitals. 5Introduction This paper was prepared as background for the World Bank's Poverty A ssessment for Guatemala. The objective of the paper is to provide a detailed analysis of the health sector in Guatemala, with special emphases on the health conditions of the poor and on distribution and inequality issues. The study also provides recommend ations to the government in Guatemala on how to improve the efficiency, quality, and equity of health services in the community. The findings presented in this report are based on the Guatemalan Living Standard Measurement Survey (ENCOVI 2000/INE), a nati onally representative, multipurpose household survey carried out during the period July to December 2000. ENCOVI 2000 data are available for 7,276 households (37,771 individuals) living in urban and rural areas of 22 departments in eight regions all over t he country. While not complete in terms of its coverage of health issues, the ENCOVI is unique in terms of its representative sample and its data on other themes and poverty variables. Guatemala is a very diverse country demographically, geographically, e thnically, economically, and socially. The total population of Guatemala in 1999 was approximately 11 million people, implying an average density of 96 people per square kilometer. Elevations range from sea level to about 3,800 meters. Despite the fact tha t one -fifth of the population lives in Guatemala City and that Guatemala has had a relatively high rate of population growth (2.6 percent between 1994 and 1999), Guatemala is the least urbanized country in Central America; only 39 percent of the people live in urban areas. While Guatemala is the most populous country and the largest economy in Central America, its rural and Mayan population still lives in great deprivation and are excluded socially, economically, and politically due to language and geograph ical barriers and to a lack of education and economic opportunities. Compared with other countries with a similar per capita GDP level, Guatemala stands out as having an inordinately high rate of poverty. According to the most recent estimates, 56 percent of Guatemalan families lived below the poverty line in 2000, which is defined as having insufficient resources to purchase a basic basket of goods and services. Moreover, 16 percent were in extreme poverty, in other words, they could not afford a basic ba sket simply of food. These two figures are even higher for the indigenous sub -population: 76 percent and 27 percent respectively.1 Guatemala has among the worst health outcomes in all of Latin America, as shown in Part I. Although it is tempting to ascrib e this poor performance to poverty and prolonged civil strife, these are only part of the problem. Key obstacles to better outcomes include inadequacies and inefficiencies on the supply side, as shown in Part II as well as a number of factors on the deman d side (Part III). Building on this analysis, we present a set of recommendations for ways in which the government could better invest public resources to ease these constraints and to promote better outcomes for its population, as discussed in Part IV. 1 World Bank estimates based on ENCOVI 2000/INE 6I: Health Challenges in Guatemala Guatemala is clearly lagging behind in the demographic and epidemiological transitions and has among the worst health indicators in Latin America, even worse than those of its Central American neighbors. The Demographic Transition The1994 Census estimated the population of Guatemala to be of 8,331,874 inhabitants, with a population density of 77 inhabitants per squared kilometer. According to the projections of the National Statistical Office (INE), the population reache d 11 million individuals in 1999, as a result of average yearly increases of 2.6 percent. As shown in Table 1.1, the general mortality rate decelerated significantly over the last few years of the 1990s in line with the ageing trend of the world populatio n. At the same time, the number of live births increased by about 2 percent in the 1995 -99 period as a consequence of past high fertility that means that a large share of the population are currently in their reproductive years. As a result of the reducti on in mortality rate (especially at younger ages2), life expectancy at birth has increased from 57 years in 1980 to 65 years in 1999.3 Table 1.1: Demographic Indicators in Guatemala: Historical Trend 1995 1997 1998 1999 Total Population (thousands of p eople) 9,976 10,456 10,791 11,111 Number of Live Births (thousands of people) 372 370 378 378 Birth Rate (number of births per 1,000 inhabitants) 44.6 35.4 35.1 34.0 General Mortality (number of deaths per 1,000 inhabitants) 7.7 5.5 5.3 4.8 Source: Sit uacion de Salud en Guatemala, Indicadores Basicos (1995, 1997, 1998, 1999) Guatemala's Extremely Young Population. Given the high fertility observed in the past, the profile of population in Guatemala is still very young, as shown in Figure 1.1. For exa mple, young people under the age of 15 account for 44 percent of the total population. The corresponding figure for individuals older than 65 is only 4 percent. 2 See Part III for more detailed information on the morbidity pattern of the last few years. 3 HNP Statistics, World Bank. 7Figure 1.1: Population Age Structure in Guatemala, 2000 Total Population 0 300 600 900 1,200 1,500 1,8000-410-1420-2430-3440-4450-5460-6470-7480-8490-94Age Groups Number of Individuals (Thousands) Poor/Non Poor 0 300 600 900 1,2000-410-1420-2430-3440-4450-5460-6470-7480-8490-94 Age Groups Number of Individuals (Thousands)Non Poor Poor Source: World Bank calculations using the ENCOVI 2000, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica - Guatemala The median age for the Guatemalan population in 2000 was only 18.0 years compared to 24.4 years, which is the average for the Latin America and Caribbean r egion.

The dependency ratio, measured as the ratio of individuals younger than 15 and older than 65 compared to all individual s in the 15 to 64 age group, is 0.9. Children still account for the largest percentage of all dependents; more than nine in every 10 people in the dependent population in Guatemala are under the age of 15.4 Despite a slight reduction over the last 10 yea rs, the dependency ratio in Guatemala is the highest in the Latin American region and is comparable only to those observed in African countries. Note the similar patterns high dependency ratios observed in the other Central American countries (Honduras, Ni caragua, Panama, and El Salvador). 4 Authors' elaboration of the ENCOVI/INE 2000 data. 8Table 1.3: Dependency Ratios - Latin America and the Caribbean Region Dependents as Proportion of Working - Age Population 1980 1999 Guatemala 1.0 0.9 Bolivia 0.9 0.8 Haiti 0.9 0.8 Honduras 1.0 0.8 Nicaragua 1.0 0.8 Paraguay 0.9 0.8 El Salvador 0.9 0.7 Chile 0.6 0.6 Colombia 0.8 0.6 Dominican Republic 0.8 0.6 Ecuador 0.9 0.6 Mexico 1.0 0.6 Panama 0.8 0.6 Peru 0.8 0.6 Costa Rica 0.7 0.6 Brazil 0.7 0.5 Bulgaria 0.5 0.5 Puerto Rico 0.7 0.5 Trinidad and To bago 0.7 0.5 LAC 0.8 0.6 Low & middle income 0.8 0.6 World 0.7 0.6 Source: WDI Fertility remains the driving force behind the natural increase of the population. As shown in Table 1.4, Guatemala had a total fertility rate of 5.0 in 1998, practically u nchanged from 1995 and well above the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman.5 It is the highest fertility rate of all of the Latin America and the Caribbean countries and is comparable to those observed in the least developed countries in the world. According to the latest UN report, Africa had a total fertility rate of 5.3 children per woman, compared to only 2.7 in the Latin American region and 2.8 in the world as a whole during the 1995 -2000 period.6 Table 1.4: Total Fertility Rate - Guatemala and Latin America Guatemala 1998/99 5.0 Guatemala 1995 5.1 Bolivia 1998 4.2 Nicaragua 1997 3.6 Peru 1996 3.5 Dominican Republic 1996 3.2 Colombia 1995 3.0 Brazil 1996 2.5 Note: Women 15 -49 Source DHS 5 The replacement level is the fertility level that needs to be sustained over the long run to ensure that a population replaces itself (children born replace people who have died). 6 UN, 2001 9The high fertility rate observed in Guat emala is driven by the limited use of contraceptives. In 2000, only 55 percent of all women knew of at least one birth control method.7 Knowledge of contraceptive methods is more limited in rural areas and among the poor where the proportion of women who k now of family planning is only 44 percent and 40 percent respectively. The corresponding figure is much higher in urban areas (80 percent) and among the non -poor (70 percent). Lack of knowledge of birth control methods is higher in the Noroccidente, Norte, and Suroccidente regions, where 78 percent, 57 percent, and 52 percent of women respectively did not know anything about contraceptive methods. It has been firmly established that child health is worse (and child mortality higher) when births are spaced at short intervals and for high -parity births. Short birth intervals probably lead to babies having worse health and nutrition outcomes through maternal depletion], greater competition among siblings for resources and for their parents' attention, and inc reased transmission of infection among siblings.8 The ENCOVI 2000/INE data show that malnutrition increases monotonically with the birth order of the child and is worse when birth intervals are short.9 Table 1.5: - The Proportion of Guatemalan Women who K now about Birth Control Methods (2000) Total 54.4 Area Rural 43.9 Urban 78.6 Poverty Status All Poor 40.2 Non Poor 70.6 Ethnicity Indigenous 33.6 K'iche 33.0 Q'ueqchi 37.6 Kaqchiquel 49.4 Mam 30.1 Other the ENCOVI 2000, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00eds tica - Guatemala, (expanded values, based on a sample of 3391 women) 7 ENCOVI 2000/ INE. 8 Pebley and Stupp (1987). 9 Marini and Gragnolati (2001). 10Guatemala has one of the lowest rates of contraceptive use in Latin America, second only to Haiti10 (see Table 1.6). Note that contraceptive use in general is very low in Latin America. A recent survey presented by the Scientific Committee of Health and Women showed that about half of the pregnancies in Latin America (52 percent) are unwanted and they happen, in part, because many adolescents do not use the available contraceptive methods.11 Table 1.6: Contraceptive Use in Guatemala and Latin America Use of Contraceptive Methods Any method Any modern method Guatemala 1998/99 26.6 21.7 Guatemala 1995 21.4 18.4 Guatemala 1987 16.2 13.4 Haiti 1994/95 12.3 8.9 Bolivia 1998 31.4 16.5 Ecuador 1987 29.0 23.5 Paraguay 1990 32.7 23.6 Peru 1996 40.9 26.4 Mexico 1987 33.9 28.9 El Salvador 1985 32.3 30.4 Trinidad & Tobago 1987 37.4 31.5 Nicaragua 1997 40.8 39.0 Colombia 1995 48.1 39.5 Dominican il 1996 55.4 51.0 Source: DHS In addition, Guatemala comes second lowest in Latin America on the basis of the average age of mothers at the time of their first birth (Table 1.7). There is considerable evidence that childbearing both at very young and at relatively old ages has deleterious consequences for the health and survival of those babies. . In Guatemala, the prevalence of chronic malnutrition among children whose mothers were younger than 18 years old at the time of giving birth is much higher than that of children of older mothers (51 percent and 45 percent respectively).12 10 Because of the high number of missing observations, the ENCOVI/INE data do not allow for an analysis of the actual use of contraceptive methods. The data in the table refer to DHS data from various years. 11 A total of 7,456 women aged between 15 and 45 years from 14 Latin countries including Brazil participated in the research. The research revealed also that the younger the woman, the lower the use of contraceptives. Among adolescents aged 15 to 19 years, 71 percent did not use any method to prevent pregnancy. Despite those rates, 98 percent of those interviewed admitted to knowing about contraceptive pills but only 28 percent of them use it.

Note that the average number of pregnancies among non -indigenous women (five) is the same as among non -poor women. Indigenous women have on average a lower number of pregnancies than poor (eight) and extremely poor women (nine). Peten is the region with the highest average number of pregnancies (almost eight per woman). In the Metropolitan region, women have on average only four pregnancies (Table 1.8).

Campaigns aimed at changing people's preferences regarding education, health care, and the employment and social status of women could generate a significant reduction in fertility. Family planning would have more chance of success if it were incorporated into existing health services and we re directed to very young people before they become sexually active. The Indigenous Population. One very distinctive feature of Guatemalan demography, in comparison to other Latin American countries, is the large proportion of indigenous people in the population : 43 percent according to the ENCOVI 2000/INE estimates.13 The population is divided into 24 ethnic groups, 23 of which are indigenous. There are three major indigenous groups: (i) the Mayan, characterized by 21 different ethnic groups; (ii) the Gar ifuna, originally from the first African contingencies that reached Guatemala during the colonial period; and (iii) the Xinca, whose origin is still unclear but who are believed to have been in the country since the Spanish arrived. The four main indigen ous languages include the Quiche (spoken by 22 percent of the indigenous population), the Kaqchiqel (21 percent), the Mam (20 percent), and the Q'eqchi (15 percent). The first three languages are each spoken by more than a million people. Table 1.9: Most Common Indigenous Languages in Guatemala Language Number of Municipalities where the Language is Spoken Number of Departments where the Language is Spoken K'iche 70 7 Mam 56 4 Kaqchikel 47 8 K'eqchi 15 4 Source: OPS/OMS (2001) Even if many people ar e bilingual (speaking both Maya and Spanish), a large number of people only speak one of the 23 non -official languages (including the 21 Mayan, Garifuna, and Xinca languages). These people can only communicate with other members of their ethnic community and, therefore, often are excluded and discriminated against by society in general.14 Indigenous people have maintained a separate Mayan cultural identity. The non -indigenous, regardless of their ethnic origin, speak Spanish, wear western clothes, and percei ve themselves to be part of the dominant Western culture.15 While the non -indigenous belong to all social classes, the great majority of the indigenous population is concentrated at the bottom of the income distribution. According to the ENCOVI 2000/INE dat a, 76 percent of indigenous people are poor and 27 percent are extremely poor. Moreover, 49 percent of the indigenous population is illiterate, in contrast with 20 percent of the non -indigenous people.16 13 Other estimates put the indigenous population share as high as 60 percent (CELADE, 1994). 14 Clert, Woolcock, Iba\u00f1ez, and Lindert (2001). 15 The term ladino refers to a \"person no longer identified culturally as Indian and, in Guatemala, includes many individu als genetically Indian as well as those representing various degrees of European -Indian racial mixtures who are Mestizos in the customary sense\", Scrimshaw and Tejada (1970). 16 Aged 14 and over, see Edwards J. (2001). 13The modernization process, the language barrier, th e lack of policies that favor the indigenous population, and development programs that do not take into account indigenous customs and practices are all contributing to the social marginalization of indigenous people. Internal Displacement. In 1987, the g overnment introduced a process of voluntary individual repatriation for Guatemalans who had been living for years in the neighboring countries (mainly Mexico) to escape the conflict at home . Since then, an increasing number of Guatemalans have been return ing home. It is estimated that about 20,000 returned between 1993 and 1995. Since 1996, when the Peace Accords where signed, many more people have returned. The majority of those who went back to Guatemala re -settled in the most remote areas, where they ar e now living in precarious conditions with limited access to basic services. Internal migration17 is a long -term phenomenon in Guatemala. It originated during the colonial period when indigenous workers descended from the Altiplano to the south coast to wor k in activities related to business and to the salt trade. By the end of 1800 and with the coming of the liberal revolution, the land property system was modified and during the 1880s , a new capitalist system was formed, which depended on agricultural expo rts (initially coffee and then sugar and cotton). The lack of a workforce was overcome by forcing indigenous people to migrate from the mountains to the plantations on the southern coast. By the end of the 19th century, representatives of the fincas (cente rs of agricultural production) began to contact people who were still living in the mountains ( campesinos ) and pay them in advance in return for a commitment to work for a fixed number of days on the finca in the future. This system of recruiting people c ontributed to the expansion of Guatemala's export economy. These recruiters (known as habilitadores) were normally people from good social and economic backgrounds, who were able to force those campesinos with debts or who were in need of money to migrate to the plantations. According to the most recent ENCOVI 2000/INE estimates, there are about 150,000 temporary workers in the fincas of the Southern coasts, a third of whom are children. The majority of migrants come from rural areas characterized by sma llholdings that do not produce enough foodto enable households to be self -sufficient. Therefore, household members migrate to the coast in order to get temporary jobs during the harvesting season for sugar, coffee, and cotton that enables them to increase their income. Migrants to the fincas are mainly indigenous workers, with high illiteracy rates. Among the most important negative consequences of temporary migration are the disintegration of families (often only part of the family migrates), the loss of t raditional values, and limited educational opportunities for migrants and their children. Migrants also have to bear many health costs. In general, they have no (or limited) access to health services. Also, the precarious conditions of life (in particular, workers' inadequate houses, which often lack basic services) and of work (such as exposure to pesticides and unsafe machinery) favor the transmission of diseases and increase the risk of accidents . Malnutrition, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections , and on-the-job accidents are among the most important risks to the health of migrants. In addition, the high incidence of prostitution in the fincas , especially in the area of Escuintila, increases the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases an d AIDS. Alcoholism is also an important cause of morbidity for the migrant population. Increasing migrants' access to basic health services is, therefore, a major challenge for Guatemala. Some progress has been made in that direction thanks to the implem entation of the new Integrated Health Service (SIAS) - see Part II. 17MSPAS, IGSS, and OPS (1998). 14 Health Indicators Guatemala has among the worst health indicators in Latin America. Unlike many other countries in the region, Guatemala has yet to experience the epidemiological changes that are known as the health transition. Infant Mortality . The infant mortality rate18 is considered to be one of the most sensitive measures of a population's health as it is usually a signal of the mortality risk from infectious, communicable diseases an d other diseases associated with poor sanitary conditions and malnourishment. In Guatemala, infant mortality has declined steadily over the last two decades, reaching 45 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1998 (Table 1.10). Table 1.10: Infant Mortality Rate in Guatemala - Historical Trend 1987 72.7 1995 51.1 1998 -99 45.1 Source: DHS However, compared to other countries in Latin America, infant mortality in Guatemala remains high (Table 1.11). Haiti, with 70 deaths per 1,000 live births, and Bolivia, with 5 0, are the only countries that have higher mortality rates.

Life expectancy at birth19 in Guatemala is one of the lowest in the Latin American region at 65 years, after only Haiti (53) and Bolivia (62 years) (see Table 1.12). Guatemala's life expectancy is lower tha n the 70 year target set by Pan American Health Organization for the end of the 20th century in its report \"Strategy for Health for All by the Year 2000.\" Table 1.12: - Life Expectancy at Birth in the Latin America Region (1999) - Years Male Female Total Hait\u00ed 51 56 53 Bolivia 60 64 62 Guatemala 62 68 65 Brazil 63 71 67 Ecuador 68 71 69 Nicaragua 66 71 69 Peru 66 71 69 Colombia 67 74 70 El Salvador 67 72 70 Honduras 67 72 70 Paraguay 68 72 70 Dominican Republic 69 73 71 M\u00e9xico 69 75 72 Trini dad & Tobago 70 75 73 Panama 72 76 74 Chile 73 79 76 Puerto Rico 71 80 76 Costa Rica 75 79 77 LAC 67 73 70 Low & middle income 63 66 64 World 65 69 66 Source: WDI 2001 Malnutrition. The epidemiological profile of Guatemala is characterized by a h igh prevalence of malnutrition20 and of infectious diseases associated with poverty (diarrhea and acute respiratory infections in particular), by the permanence of epidemics such as cholera and dengue, by an increase in chronic and degenerative non -communi cable diseases (due to the aging of the Guatemalan population), and by a high incidence of deaths due to accidents and violence. The prevalence of malnutrition is much higher in Guatemala than in its neighboring Central American countries or than in any o ther country in Latin America (Table 1.13).21,22 19 The average number of additional years a person of given age could expect to live if current mortality trends were to continue for the rest of that person's life. 20 Marini Gragnolat i (2001). 21 The selection of the countries is based on available comparable data. 22 Marini and Gragnolati (2001). 16Table 1.13: Prevalence of Malnutrition in the Latin America & Caribbean Countries Percentage of Children < 5 Stunted Wasted Underweight Guatemala 1987 57.8 1.3 33.2 Guatemala 1995 49.7 3.3 26.6 Guatemala 1998/99 46.4 2.5 24.2 Guatemala 2000 44.2 2.8 22.3 Bolivia 1998 26.8 1.3 7.6 Peru 1996 25.8 1.1 7.8 Nicaragua 1997 24.9 2.2 12.2 Colombia 1995 15 1.4 8.4 Dominican Republic 1996 10.7 1.2 5.9 Brazil 1996 10.5 2.3 5.7 Note: Children < 5 Source s: DHS and World Bank calculations using the ENCOVI 2000, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica - Guatemala. The Main Causes of Morbidity and Mortality. Indicators of morbidity and mortality clearly reflect Guatemala's position in the epidemiological transit ion. Table 1.14 presents information on the main causes of mortality in Guatemala.23 Malnutrition is the most important cause of mortality, with almost 2 deaths per 1000 inhabitants in 1999. Deaths due to malnutrition have increased over time, which is the reverse of the trend observed for the two other most important causes of mortality diarrhea or pneumonia. Deaths due to cholera seem to have decreased slightly. The data also indicate that there has been a recent decrease in the number of deaths due to su icide and accidents.

While the incidence of cholera and dengue has rapidly decreased over the last five years, malaria, diarrhea, and acute respiratory infections have increased significantly.24 23 The data come from a yearly publication of the Ministry of Health and Public Action of Guatemala, Situaci\u00f3n de Salud en Guatemala, Indicado res B\u00e1sicos . 24 ENCOVI/INE 2000 data indirectly confirm the finding that mortality from diarrhea and acute respiratory infections has decreased in the past few years. This seems to be due to increased use of modern medicines for treating infected cases. A v ery large proportion of children affected by diarrhea or acute respiratory infections are currently treated with medicines, regardless of their socioeconomic status or the area in which they live. Previous DHS surveys do not contain 17Table 1.15: Selected Indicators of Morbidi ty in Guatemala (1995 -1999) 1995 1997 1998 1999 Incidence of Cholera (per 100,000 inhabitants) 83.3 - 52.5 18.7 Incidence of Diarrhea (per 10,000 inhabitants) 83.8 100.3 249.3 347.1 Incidence of Malaria (per 10,000 inhabitants) 23.6 59.0 80.7 91.2 Incidence of Dengue (per 10,000 inhabitants) - 5.91 4.25 3.26 Incidence of ARI (per 10,000 inhabitants) 178.8 536.1 539.5 917.3 Source: Situaci\u00f3n de Salud en Guatemala, Indicadores B\u00e1sicos (1995, 1997, 1998, 1999) Table 1.16 presents the estimated preva lence of diseases and accidents among the Guatemalan population in 2000 using the ENCOVI/INE 2000 survey. Overall, a quarter of the population reported having suffered from some type of accident or disease, however temporary (such as toothaches, headaches, or ear infections) during the month prior to the interview. There is no significant difference in the prevalence of disease or accidents between people living in urban areas and those living in rural areas, nor between indigenous and non -indigenous indiv iduals. The proportion of people who declared that they had been sick or to had had an accident increases with per capita consumption. Similarly, a higher prevalence of disease and accidents is observed among the non -poor than among the poor. This informat ion is difficult to interpret because of the close correlation between income and reported morbidity. Poorer people may have higher opportunity costs to declaring themselves ill and staying at home or they simply may have a different perception of \"being s ick.\" information on the prev alence of children treated with modern medicines but only on the oral re -hydration treatments, and, therefore, comparisons are not possible.

Source: World Bank calculations using the ENCOVI 2000, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica - Guatemala Diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, together with under -nutrition, are the most important causes of child mortality in Latin America. Both the duration and the frequency of infectious diseases affect children's nutritional status by reducing their appetite and by interfering with their nutrient absorptio n, utilization, and requirement through a number of different mechanisms. These include loss of appetite, energy lost as heat during fever, loss of other nutrients in sweat, vomiting, decreased absorption of nutrients, and protein catabolism.25 On the othe r side, malnutrition makes children weaker and more vulnerable to infectious diseases such as diarrhea and respiratory infections. Diarrhea diseases are the most important of all of the infant and child infections in developing countries in terms of thei r effect on the health status of infants and children. 26 Diarrhea causes 25 Rohde (1986); Victora et al (1986). 26 Chen and Scrimshaw (1983) 19food to pass through the intestine too quickly to be absorbed. Epidemiological data indicate that diarrhea diseases occur with greater frequency during the period of weaning and that children's exposure to agents that cause diarrhea occurs largely through fecal contamination.27 The main cause of death from diarrhea is dehydration, resulting from the loss of fluids and electrolysis through the stools.28 The consequences of respiratory inf ections on children's growth are less clear. Martorell and Yarbrough (1983) found upper -tract respiratory infections to be negatively associated with children's speed of growth only in one of seven studies carried out in Africa and Latin America. A longitu dinal study of 5,914 children conducted in Brazil between 1982 and 1986 revealed that, although severe respiratory infections had a negative impact on their growth, hospital admissions for children with diarrhea were more strongly associated with subsequen t malnutrition than were admissions for pneumonia. At the same time, however, malnutrition was a more important risk factor for pneumonia than it was for diarrhea. All of the associations were stronger in the first two years of life than at older ages.29 Table 1.17 shows estimates of prevalence of and treatment patterns for diarrhea infections among children under six years old in Guatemala. Overall, 30 percent of the children suffered from diarrhea, a much higher proportion than that observed in the earlier 1998 -99 DHS survey (12 percent). The data also show a significant difference in the prevalence of diarrhea between rural areas (35 percent) and urban (25 percent) areas and an increasing prevalence among children in the lower consumption quintiles. The No rte region had a much higher percentage of children suffering from diarrhea than any other region. Note that the same region had a very high prevalence of child chronic malnutrition (47 percent).30 The link between diarrhea and malnutrition is very strong a nd goes in both directions. The majority of children who have diarrhea (68 percent) are treated with medicines, 12 percent with traditional remedies, and 7 percent with oral re -hydration salts. Only 4 percent of infected children did not receive any form of treatment. Children of richer households are more likely than children of poorer households to be treated with modern medicines instead of traditional remedies. A similar pattern is observed among the poor and the non -poor. There is no significant difference in treatment patterns between urban and rural areas. Non -indigenous people use oral re-hydration salts more frequently than indigenous people, while folk serum and folk remedies are more common among the indigenous. A very large proportion of childr en in the Peten and Metropolitan areas is treated with modern medicines. Modern medicines are used the least in the Norte region where there is a tendency to treat diarrhea with traditional remedies and simple water. 27 Pebley, Hurtado and Goldman, (1996). 28 PAHO, 1998 29 Victora et al 1990 30 Marini . and Gragnolati 2001. 20Table 1.17: Prevalence and Treatment of Diarrhea among Children under 6 Prevalence Treatment (%) Water Folk Serum Oral Re - Hydration Salts Herbal Tea Other Folk Remedies Modern Medicines Other Nothing Total 31.3 3.2 4.6 7.0 0.4 12.5 68.0 0.1 4.3 Consumption Quintile Q1 33.8 3.6 5.1 8.1 0.0 15.6 60.6 0.0 6.9 Q2 35.2 2.5 3.7 6.8 0.9 12.2 71.5 0.1 2.3 Q3 30.5 3.9 7.7 7.0 0.0 12.5 65.1 0.1 3.6 Q4 27.8 2.6 1.4 6.8 0.7 9.4 77.9 0.1 1.0 Q5 24.1 3.4 4.5 4.8 0.5 7.5 70.0 0.1 9.1 Poverty Status Non Poor 27.4 2.5 5.1 5.5 0.5 8.6 74.0 0.1 3.7 All Poor 33.2 3.5 4.4 7.6 0.4 14.0 65.6 0.1 4.5 Extremely Poor 33.8 4.4 5.8 8.1 0.0 16.8 57.8 0.1 7.1 Ethnicity Indigenous 35.6 3.6 5.6 6.6 0.5 13.7 64.5 0.2 5.5 K'iche 30.5 6.2 1.7 4.4 0.1 21.9 61.5 0.1 3.4 Q'ueqchi 49.7 1.6 1.7 10.3 0.5 6.8 66.0 0.6 12.5 Kaqchiquel 32.9 1.4 9.3 5.7 - 8.1 71.7 - 3.9 Mam 33.9 4.8 7.6 6.0 0.7 14.1 64.8 - 2.1 Other Mayan 34.4 4.2 7.9 5.8 - 16.9 60.5 - 4.7 Other Indigenous 43.4 - 12.0 - 15.1 42.9 30.0 - - Non-indigenous 27.5 2.8 3.5 7.6 0.3 10.9 72.0 0.1 2.9 Area Urban 24.7 2.9 6.4 6.4 0.5 11.2 68.5 0.2 3.9 Rural 34.5 3.3 4.0 7.3 0.4 12.8 67.8 0.0 4.4 Region Metropolitana 28.5 2.9 4.7 7.9 0.2 6.9 74.0 0.0 3.4 Norte 50.7 6.5 5.2 9.9 0.4 8.7 58.0 0.6 10.6 Noror iente 25.8 2.0 3.5 10.8 0.0 17.2 65.8 0.0 0.6 Suroriente 25.4 0.0 4.7 13.0 0.9 16.0 63.8 0.3 1.4 Central 26.3 1.7 4.5 4.8 0.3 15.5 67.2 0.0 6.1 Suroccidente 32.9 2.6 4.7 5.1 0.5 12.2 72.8 0.0 2.2 Noroccidente 28.7 5.0 4.8 5.2 0.3 18.4 61.7 0.0 4.7 Peten 33.5 1.5 2.7 1.4 0.8 9.5 79.6 0.4 4.2 Note: Data refer to the month before the interview. Source: World Bank calculations using the ENCOVI 2000, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica - Guatemala Table 1.18 shows the prevalence of and treatment patterns for acute respiratory infections (ARI). Overall, mothers report that almost half of their children suffered from ARI in the month prior to the interview. No significant difference was observed in the prevalence of ARI among children of different economic sta tus, poverty level, or ethnicity.31 The percentage of children suffering of respiratory infections is much higher in rural areas (51 percent) than in urban areas (41 percent). Norte and Nororiente regions had the highest prevalence. 31 As for diarrhea, caution must be applied in using reported morbid ity information to estimate the incidence of disease because of the close correlation between income and reported sickness observed in many household surveys. 21Acute respiratory infec tion is a very common cause of illness among children in developing countries and is also one of the major causes of infant deaths in the world. There is growing evidence in the literature of a strong association between indoor air pollution and respirator y infections among preschool children. Studies in Guatemala also confirm the high exposure of women and children to toxic pollutants from fuel wood combustion. A recent study based on the 1998-99 DHS survey points to the strong association between acute re spiratory infections and the use of fuel wood in homes without chimneys.32 A very high percentage of children suffering from respiratory infections are treated with medicines (84 percent), while folk remedies are used only in 7.5 percent of the cases. Ther e is no significant difference in the type of remedies used by the poor and the non -poor. However, the extremely poor do seem to follow a different treatment pattern (medicines and natural remedies are used in 70 percent and 10 percent of the cases respect ively). Similar to the pattern observed for diarrhea, a very high proportion of ARI infections among children in Peten is treated with modern medicines (93.9 percent). Natural medicines are used more often in the Norte and Nororiente regions, while folk re medies are used most often in the Nortoccidente region. 32 Torres (2001). 22Table 1.18: Prevalence and Treatment of Acute Respiratory Infections among Children under 6 Prevalence Treatment (%) Modern Medicines Natural Medicines Folk Remedies Nothing Total 47.9 84.1 4.8 7.5 3.6 Consumption Quintile Q1 47.4 73.1 9.1 1.0 Q5 46.0 94.0 1.2 3.6 1.2 Poverty Status Non Poor 48.2 90.3 3.1 5.5 1.2 All Poor 47.7 80.9 5.8 8.5 4.8 Extre mely Poor 47.6 71.1 10.1 8.8 9.9 Ethnicity Indigenous 48.8 78.7 6.0 9.4 5.8 K'iche 41.2 83.7 5.1 58.5 80.5 1.5 Kaqchiquel Other Mayan 3.8 5.7 1.5 Area Urban 41.2 89.3 2.2 6.4 2.0 Rural 51.1 81.9 5.9 7.9 4.2 Region Metropolitana 43.1 84.0 3.7 9.1 3.2 Norte 63.6 73.9 10.7 4.3 11.1 Nororiente 57.7 91.5 6.4 1.2 1.0 Suroriente 49.1 88.3 1.4 9.0 1.4 Central 46.5 84.1 4.7 6.7 4.5 Suroccidente 49.2 84.9 4.8 8.7 1.7 Noroccidente 36.6 79.5 2.9 12.7 4.6 Peten 44.2 93.9 1.2 2.3 2.7 Note: Data refer to the month before the interview. Source: World Bank calculations using the ENCOVI 2000, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica - Guatemala The first case of AIDS was reported in Guatemala in June 1984 in a 28 -year old man coming from the United States. All of the cases registered during the following two years were related to homosexual men, who had lived in the United States and who came back to Guatemala when his disease was already in an advanced phase. 33 In 1986, for the first time, two women were found to have AIDS. They also came from the United States and had contracted th e virus through a blood transfusion. In 1988, for the first time, two Guatemalan residents were reported to have 33 N\u00fa\u00f1ez (2001). 23contracted the virus a 12-year-old girl who had received a blood transfusion and a 38 -year-old homosexual man. In December 2000, according to the National Program for AIDS control ( Programa Nacional de Control de ETS y SIDA or PNS), 4,000 cases of AIDS were officially recognized in Guatemala, with a possible under -estimation of 50 percent. Over time, the proportion of women infected by the viru s has increased significantly from a ratio of 6.5 infected men for each woman in 1986 to 3.0 infected men for each woman in 2000. The increase in infected women of reproductive age implies that there is also a higher probability of vertical transmission fr om mothers to their children. In 1999, the number of children younger than 12 months old infected by the virus doubled over the previous year. Moreover, there has been a significant increase in the number of children that contracted the virus through bloo d transfusion or sexual abuse. More than 50 percent of the reported cases are concentrated in the department of Guatemala, where, by the end of 2000, the incidence peaked at 78 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The majority of cases are associated with the presence of sexual transmitted infections. The prevalence of such infections in Guatemala is probably associated, among other things, with very limited use of condoms and a lack of information on these infections and on how to prevent them. \"Women genera lly die during the delivery, either because they could not deliver or because they could deliver but then bleeded, had high temperature and died. It is their most common death .\" (IP, M2).34 Death associated with pregnancy or childbirth is one of the most im portant causes of mortality among women of reproductive age. According to the latest WHO and UNICEF estimates, the estimated number of maternal deaths in the world in 1995 was more than 500,000, of which over one -half occurred in Africa, about 40 percent i n Asia, and 4 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean.35 Among Central American countries, Guatemala clearly stands out as the country with the highest number of women who die from problems related to pregnancy or delivery (Table 1.19) Most of those deat hs could be prevented by simple and cheap interventions.36 Among the most important determinants of maternal mortality are: large number of children , low maternal age at birth, spacing births close together, poor socioeconomic conditions, and limited access to health services. 37 Table 1.19:Maternal Mortality Rate - Number of Women who Die during Pregnancy or Childbirth (per 100,000 live births) Reported Adjusted most recently 1995 Guatemala 190 270 Nicaragua 150 250 El Salvador 120 180 Honduras 110 220 Panama 70 100 Costa Rica 29 35 Source: WDI, 2001 Note: \"Maternal Mortality ratios shown in the table as reported are estimates based on national surveys, vital registration, or surveillance or are derived from community and hospital records. Those shown as adjusted are based on 34 QPES (2001). 35 WHO (2001). 36 UNICEF (1999). 37 DHS (1995). 24a modeling exercise carried out by the WHO and UNICEF. In this exercise maternal mortality was estimated with a regression model using information on fertility, birth attendants, and HIV prevalence. Neither set of ratios can be assumed to provide an accurate estimate of maternal mortality in any of the countries in the table\". (WDI, 2001 page 109). The Qualitative and Poverty Exclusion Study (QPES) indicates that maternal mortality is an important idiosyncratic shock faced b y the villagers.38 In particular, a lack of health services and ambulances for transportation is the most important cause of death for women in one village in the survey .39 Reasons for Guatemala's Poor Health Outcomes Guatemala's poor health performance is mainly due to poverty and to the country's prolonged history of civil conflict. Poverty. Guatemala is the least urbanized country in Central America, with only 39 percent of the people living in urban areas. Compared to other countries, Guatemala stands ou t as having an inordinately high rate of poverty for its level of per capita GDP. According to the most recent estimates, 56 percent of Guatemalan families lived below the poverty line in 2000, which is defined as having insufficient income to purchase a b asic basket of goods and services. Among these, 16 percent were in extreme poverty, which means that they could not afford a basic basket simply of food. These two figures are higher for the indigenous sub -population 76 percent and 27 percent respectively. 40 Indeed there is some correlation between poverty and poor health outcomes, as is evident in Table 1.20 where the region with the highest poverty rates also has the highest rate of child malnutrition.

The QPES collected data in ten rural communities that are also included in the ENCOVI. The configuration of these villages seeks to examine perceptions of poverty and exclusion fo r a number of ethnicities; as such, the sample includes two villages from each of the following ethnic groups: Mam, K'iche, Q'eqchi, Kaqchiqel, and Ladino (non -indigenous). For the purposes of protecting the anonymity of respondents, each village is given a code name (e.g., M1, M2, K1, K2, etc.). The field work covered a number of themes including: perceptions of poverty and welfare; perceptions of risk, shocks and vulnerability; social capital; user perceptions of public programs; community perceptions o f education; and gender roles and issues. The main research instruments included: community focus groups, direct interviews, social mapping, and observation. See Annex 5 of the main report for a summary of the main findings of each of the ten QPES villag es. 39 QPES (2001). 40 World Bank estimates based on ENCOVI 2000/INE 25Civil Conflict . A similar correlation is evident between patterns of conflict and health outcomes. In December 1996, Guatemala ended 36 years of internal armed civil conflict when the governme nt and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca agreed to a ceasefire and signed the \"Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace.\"41 During the civil war, the military led a campaign of terrorism and genocide against the Mayan groups, with their main obj ective being the distribution of the native people's land to plantation owners. Several hundred villages were destroyed and their inhabitants were either killed or forced into exile to Mexico. For the indigenous rural population, the positive outcomes of t he peace accords have yet to materialize. Geographical and language barriers continue to exclude this group from the social, economic, and political life of the country, and past socioeconomic isolation and under -investment in rural infrastructure is refl ected in higher rates of morbidity and mortality among these people. The latest ENCOVI/INE 2000 figures confirm the existence of a very marked socioeconomic difference in child nutritional status among indigenous and non -indigenous groups. The prevalence o f stunting in children of ladino (non -indigenous) families is about 33 percent, while it is almost 60 percent among children of indigenous families. In particular, among the different ethnic groups, children of Mam and the other Mayan families appear to be most disadvantaged; the prevalence of severely stunted children among these groups averages around 40 percent.

Within Latin America, Central America provides a close comparative context within which it can be seen that issues other than poverty and conflict contribute to Guatemala's health proble ms. Guatemala has the worst health outcomes in Central America, even though it is neither the poorest country in the sub-region nor the only one to have suffered from prolonged and violent conflict. El Salvador and Nicaragua have also recently emerged f rom prolonged conflict and they are doing significantly better, with higher per capita GDP growth, lower mortality rates, lower malnutrition, and higher life expectancy (see Table 1.22 below). Clearly other factors - both on the supply side and the demand side contribute to Guatemala's poor health performance. These are discussed in the next two sections. 41 Amnesty International (1998). 26Table 1.22 -Health Indicators in Central American Countries GUA ES NIC HON CR PAN LAC Population Total (Mn),1999 11.1 6.2 4.9 6.3 3.6 2.8 508.2 Growth (%) 1980 -99, avg annual 2.6 2.2 2.7 3.0 2.4 1.9 1.8 % Urban, 1999 40 46 56 52 48 56 75 GDP PC, % growth 1998 -99 0.9 1.4 4.3 -4.5 6.1 1.2 -1.5 Public Expenditures (% GDP) Total (1998) 13.0** 15.1 - 7.2* 21.9 27.9 21.0 Health, Publi c (most recent yrs) 1.1** 2.6 8.3 3.9 5.2 4.9 3.2 Education, Public (1999) 2.2** 2.1 2.4 3.4 4.5 4.4 4.1 Health Indicators Infant mortality (1999) 40 30 34 34 12 20 30 Life expectancy (1999) 65 70 69 70 77 74 70 Malnutrition (last available ) 44 23 25 25 39 - 16 Sources: WDI 2001. * CEPAL,(1999) Data refer to 1996 -97; **World Bank (2000). II: Supply -side Obstacles to Better Health Outcomes Guatemalan health sector is characterized by several features that reduce its effectiveness in address ing the people health needs. In the following sections the main issues are presented. The Fragmentation of the Health Care Sector The Guatemalan population has limited contact with both the public and the private delivery system. A major obstacle to the pr ovision of adequate health care service is the fragmentation of the health care system and the lack of coordination between different services which often ends up in duplication. The Organization of the Health Care Sector . As is often the case in Latin Ame rica, the major actors in Guatemala's health sector are the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MPSAS), the Guatemalan Social Security Institute (IGSS), the private -for-profit sector, and private voluntary organizations. The Ministry of Pubic Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS) is responsible for providing curative and preventive care for the entire population and is the largest actor in the health care system. It provides its services at practically no charge to the users. It also has the co nstitutional responsibility for defining health sector policies and for coordinating the different actors in the sector. The MSPAS has a central administrative level, eight regions, and 27 health areas. The MSPAS's delivery system operates on three levels: (i) the first level offers services through community centers, which constitute the simplest public health facility, and health posts, which provide preventive and primary health care and some curative services; (ii) the second level comprises health cent ers of either type A (with some beds, primarily for maternal care) or type B (without beds, ambulatory care only); and (iii) the third level is made up of general and specialized hospitals, which provide curative care. The community centers are located in the most remote areas and are staffed by voluntary community members who are trained by the MSPAS. They are visited by doctors and health technicians on a regular basis (at least once a month). The health posts are usually staffed by an auxiliary nurse an d, at times, by a rural health technician. The health centers are typically staffed by a doctor, a nurse, an auxiliary nurse, a rural health technician, administrative personnel, and, at times, a laboratory technician and a dentist. 27The Guatemalan Social Security Institute (IGSS) provides retirement benefits and health services to those workers and their families in the formal sector who are covered, and it runs its own health facilities separate from those of MSPAS. While members of the IGSS can use MSPAS facilities, only affiliated members can use IGSS facilities. IGSS's two main programs are its Inalidez, Vejez Sobrevivencia (IVS) program and its Enfermedad, Maternidad y Accidentes (EMA) program. The IVS, created in 1977, provides coverage to workers e mployed by firms with three or more employees in Guatemala City and with five or more employees in the rest of the country. The EMA was created in 1978 to cover the capital and four other departments and has since slowly expanded in coverage. Although IGGS has a national scope, its programs have different geographic coverage. For this reason, employers' and employees' payments vary geographically according to the services provided in each area. The government has accumulated a large financial debt to IGSS, which is usually considered as one of the reasons why IGSS cannot extend its coverage and improve its quality.42 In 1995, the coverage rate of IGSS (16 percent) was about the same as in other Central American countries, such as El Salvador (14 percent), Ho nduras (14 percent), and Nicaragua (18 percent), but was much lower than that of Costa Rica (85 percent) and Mexico (49 percent). Per capita expenditure on IGSS is the fifth lowest in the whole Latin America and the Caribbean Region (Table 2.1).

Volume I. The remaining health services in Guatemala are provided by the Armed Forces and Police health network, by NGOs and charitable organizations, and by the private, for -profit sector. There are two types of private, for -profit providers: (i) the folk curers, herbalists, and other practitioners of traditional medicine who predate the public health sector and now coexist with it; and (ii) the 42 In 1997, the government's debt to IGSS was estimated to be about Q148,1 million. 28providers of the private modern sector, which has grown primarily in the urban areas fueled by rising incomes and dissati sfaction with the quality of public sector care. In addition to providing medical services, the private sector offers private insurance and prepayment schemes, produces pharmaceuticals, and sell medicines and medical equipment. In fact, in the latter two c ategories, the private sector is the major player. For example, private pharmacies and other sellers of drugs account for the large majority of the value of all sales of medicines. The state provides only a limited amount of regulation and control on the s ale of medicines. The NGO market is characterized by two types of organizations. The first kind consists of international voluntary organizations with local affiliates who have access to international funds, a diversified menu of projects, considerable exp erience in the sectors they specialize, and sophisticated administrative apparatus. The second kind is national NGOs that vary in size and institutional ability but, in general, have small budgets and weak administrative infrastructure. Some have had exten sive experience of providing health care. Among them are a number of religious organizations who are unique in their commitment to service provision. However, they tend to specialize, with some NGOs developing a proficiency in maternal and child health, fo r example. Others specialize in child survival and reproductive health. An increasing number offer services in traditional medicine. 29Box 1: Traditional Health Practitioners In all those communities where there is no health post or no national health se rvice, the comadrona (midwife), the curandero ( herbalist), and the ajq'ij (the Mayan priest) offer traditional and culturally acceptable health services, together with the promodor de salud, (health official ) which were installed by the SIAS program. These specialists of traditional medicine do not work full time but only when someone is sick and ask for their help. In general, their therapeutic activity complements their occupations . They tend not to have pre - fixed fees for their treatments but receive the amount of money that their clients are willing to pay or sometimes they are paid in -kind (with chicken, maize, beans, or flour, fo r example). They live in very poor conditions and often have inadequate housing and facilities. They are often illiterate or poorly educated. The Comadrona normally treats pregnant and women during delivery or serves as a gynecol ogist and sometimes a pediatrician. She is normally a woman in her forties, married or a widow, a mother or a grandmother, who shares with her patient the same language, values, and cultural beliefs. Over the last 10 years, comadronas have been integrated into the mainstream health system , by receiving training aimedat reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. She receives remuneration for the treatment that she offers that normally fluctuates between 100Q and 300Q depending on the village or the region. Note that the comadrona is triply discriminated against for being a woman, indigenous, and poor. This has become more severe lately when comadronas have referred patients to a hospital in case of complications during delivery. In those cases, the f amily of the patient often treats the comadrona as incompetent, and, in some cases, they do not pay her for her help nor for accompanying them to the hospital. Members of the family often complain about the comadronas simply because they are not allowed t o be with the patient during the delivery of the baby, or because they do not know what is going on, and because they are hungry and cold on their way to the hospital. In some regions of Guatemala, the comadrona also accompanies men in their search for a wife. The Curandero is another traditional figure who deals with the physical and psychic well being of society. He is believed to have special abilities that give him direct contact with superi or forces of which he is the mediator. He normally treats diseases such as eye problems, anger, and indigestion. He uses medicinal plants, candles, and other animal resources like black cocks, dogs' hair, turkey feathers, animal grease, tarantulas' legs, a nd animal blood. The ajq'ij , or Mayan priest, is not only responsible for the health of the village but also for the counting of the days in relation to the Mayan calendar that indicates when to celebrate seed -time and harvesting. He is normally an exper t in herbs, from the ones used for rituals, like tobacco, to the medicinal ones used for treating ailments. Sources : QPES, 2001 and. MSPAS, OPS/OMS (2001) Incomplete National Coverage and Inefficiencies: The Reform of the Health System. The Peace Agre ements, which were signed in December 1996, aimed not only to end the armed conflict but also to reformulate the country's economic and social development agenda. On the health side, the Agreements called for large changes in the health sector and committe d the MSPAS to demonstrating results after four years by increasing funds for preventive health, increasing community participation , and decentralizing services. Before the Peace Agreements were signed, Guatemala had health conditions that compared poorl y with those of Latin American countries at a similar stage of development. Life expectancy at birth was 65 years, and infant mortality 46 per 1,000 births. Moreover, morbidity and mortality rates were much higher in rural areas and among indigenous popula tions. 30The main concern at that point was the lack of coverage of the national health system. In 1996, it was estimated that 46 percent of the population were outside the areas served by the health centers and health posts. In other words, they had no acc ess to any health service. It was also estimated that, in 1997, the Metropolitan region, where 21 percent of the Guatemalan population lived, was absorbing 42 percent of all health expenditures. Moreover, up to 51 percent of these actual expenditures was s pent on curative care, while only 28 percent was invested in promoting a better health environment and better maternal and infant health. Until 1996, MSPAS's primary health activity was concentrated in 860 health posts, each of which covered about 2,000 individuals. In addition, 318 health centers, with a coverage rate of about 10,000 people per center, were providing primary - and secondary -level medical care. There were no agreements with other health service providers, and community participation was lim ited to vaccination day meetings. 43 When the new government took office in 1996, it started the process of modernizing the MSPAS. The specific public health objectives are described below. Regarding public expenditures on health, the aim was to increase a ctual spending on health by 50 percent between 1995 and 2000 and to ensure that at least 50 percent of the health budget was devoted to preventive health. There was a goal of reducing infant and maternal mortality by 50 percent between 1995 and 2000. Polio eradication certification was to be maintained and measles were to be eradicated by 2000. All health care delivery was to be decentralized to ensure the availability of health programs and services at the local level. The \" Cronograma para el Cumplime nto de los Compromisos de los Acuerdos de Paz \"44 extended the most important targets included in the Peace Agreements to the period 2000 -2004. It also called for a specific plan for traditional and indigenous medicine to be prepared after consultation with the local communities. As a response to the objective of the Peace Accord to expand coverage of basic services to the impoverished rural and indigenous population, the SIAS system ( Sistema Integrado Atenci\u00f3n de Salud ) was introduced in 1 997 with financing from the IDB Health Reform Loan. The SIAS system is defined as being responsible for the organization and administration of basic services and the resources of the health sector, according to different levels of care and administration, with the aim of: (i) extending coverage to those groups of the population that traditionally have limited access and (ii) improving the quality of health services according to criteria of equity, solidarity , and universality, in a sustainable and efficient way. The program deals with both preventive and curative care with the aim of establishing services closer to most communities and of encouraging the participation of different members of the community in administration of the program. 43 CIEN (2000). 44 Chronogram for the Accomplishment of the commitments cont ained in the Peace Accords. 31NGOs, cooperative s, municipalities, and the social security system are among the most important organizations involved in implementing the SIAS program. In order to participate in SIAS, an organization must be legally recognized, have minimal infrastructure, and have some institutional experience. In 2000, a total amount of 103.4 million Q was transferred to such institutions to help them to provide health care services at the community level . The budget for SIAS is almost completely financed by the Ministry of Public Heal th and Social Assistance. As part of the broader effort to implement organizational, institutional, and financial reforms in the health sector, Guatemala adopted a model to extend basic services to poor populations. The Program to Extend Coverage to of Bas ic Health Services ( Programa de Extension de Cobertura de Servicios Basicos ) or PCEBS started in 1997 as part of SIAS. It was established when the Government of Guatemala signed the first set of pilot agreements ( convenios ) through which four NGOs were con tracted to extend basic services to impoverished indigenous populations living in rural hamlets with little or no access to health services. By early 2000, the MSPAS had signed 137 convenios with 89 NGOs for a total coverage of 3 million people (25 percent of the total population). Figure 2.1 illustrates the success of PECBS in extending coverage. The percentage of population without access to health services declined from 46 percent in 1996 to 9 percent in late 1999. Figure 2.1: Coverage of Guatemalan Po pulation Before and After SIAS 1996 40% 14%46% MSPAS/IGSS Private Practices Without Access to Health Services December 1999 40% 14%37% 9% MSPAS/IGSS Private Practices Without Access to Health Services Extension of Coverage Source: MSPAS Under the convenios with the MSPAS, NGOs perform two distinct functions: (i) provision and (ii) administration of services. Health providers, known as PSSs ( Prestadoras de Servicios de Salud ), directly provide the basic SIAS package of services to families. This basic package includes: maternal health care,45 pre-school and school -age children's health,46 illness management and emergency care,47 and environmental services.48 Health service administrators or ASS s (Administradora de Servicios de Salud ) operate exclusively as administrators, financial managers, and payers for MSPAS primary care providers and to a lesser extent, for PSSs.49 45 The maternal health services include: prenatal care, tetanus toxoid, iron, folic acid supplementation during pregnancy, delivery, postpartum care, birth spacing (education and referral), detection of cervical and breast cance r, and referral of emergencies. 46 The child and school age health program includes: immunizations, ARI management, diarrhea/cholera management, vitamin A and iron supplementation, growth monitoring of children under two years old, and referral of emergenc ies. 47 The illness management and emergency care program includes: vector control, zoonosis and rabies control, tuberculosis control, STD/HIV and AIDS control, diarrhea and cholera control, and referral of emergencies. 48 The environmental services program includes monitoring of water quality, promotion of sanitary disposal of waste, and the improvement of household sanitary conditions and food hygiene. 49 La Forgia, Nieves, and Ribera (2000). 32In order to assess the program's performance, an impact evaluation study of a sample of areas is currently being done. Preliminary information indicates that immunization coverage rates have increased as well the monitoring of normal pregnancies by medically trained health specialists. The main objective of MSPAS for the 2000 -2004 period is to define and implement the National Health Plan ( Plan Nacional de Salud ), which aims to deliver adequately managed health care to the Guatemalan population, ensure universal access to health services, and guarantee that the population receives c are that is characterized by ethics, quality, and equity. The development of the National Health Plan is based on the following strategies: Decentralization with social and community participation. Primary health care at all levels of services provision w ith emphasis on providing information and creating self -awareness and responsibility. Equity, efficiency, quality, and social, technological and financial sustainability with a focus on the most disadvantaged groups. The following health policies provide the guiding principles for the implementation of the National Health Plan: Household -level integrated health Health for indigenous people with a focus on women Health for migrant population Integrated health development and strengthening for other groups Extension of coverage of basic health services with quality and sustainability Basic sanitation and environmental development Access to basic drugs and traditional medicine Strategic development of human resources Institutional development and decentralizat ion Intra- and inter -sectoral coordination. Improvement and optimization of donors' cooperation Development of the health sector financial system. The Low Level of Public Spending on Health Care During 1996 -1997, Guatemala had the second lowest per capi ta public spending on health (US$16) among the Latin American countries for which data are available. Only Bolivia had a lower figure 33(US$14) in the region. Per capita spending on health by the Governments of Panama and El Salvador was approximately thirte en and three times as high as that of Guatemala respectively (Table 2.2).

Per capita public spending on health in Guatemala remained very low during 1998 -2000 (Table 2.3). Between 2000 and 2001, overall public spending on health is expected to h ave increased from US$200 million to US$274 million, (37 percent) and per capita spending is expected to have increased from US$17.5 to US$23.3 (24.9 percent).50 50 Such an increase is likely to be about 10 percent smaller sinc e the 2001 figure refers to a budgeted value while the 1998, 1999, and 2000 figures refer to actual values. The proportions of actual spending were 91.6, 89.6, and 94.2 percent of budgeted spending in 1998, 1999, and 2000 respectively. 34Table 2.3: Public Social Spending in Guatemala, 1998 -2000 (US$) 1998 1999 2000 2001 Actual Budgeted Health and Social Assistance 183,345,544 214,736,493 200,729,616 274,705,790 spending on health 17.0 19.3 17.5 23.3 Source: SIAF 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 Ineffective Composition of Public Spending Public Spending in Guatemala is mainly used for current activities and skewed towards people in the highest quintiles, as shown in the following sections. Funct ional and Economic Composition. Table 2.4 presents the economic classification of public spending on health in the 2001 budget. As is often the case in Latin America, the large majority of public spending is used for current activities (81.0 percent), whic h comprise mostly wages and salaries, leaving little room for investment and maintenance activities. Table 2.4: Economic Classification of Ministry of Health and Social Assistance Spending, 2001 Capital Current Total Value Egresos del Estado (2001). Figure 2.2 shows the functional classification of public spending by the MSPAS, as indicated by the actual expenditures for 1997. Despite the fact that Guatemala is in the early stage of the demographic and health transition as described in Part I, which will require large investments in primary and preventive care, more than half of the 1997 budget (54 percent) was spent on c urative care (mostly public hospitals). Only 30 percent of the resources were invested in preventive care. 35Figure 2.2: Functional Classification of Ministry of Health and Social Assistance Spending - Actual Spending, 1997 Source: IDC, Revisi\u00f3n de l Programa de Inversi\u00f3n Publica de Mediano Plazo, Guatemala, Nov. 1998 Over four -fifths of spending on health for 2001 was expected to be financed by internal resources, mostly transfers of public revenues from the Minister of Finance (Table 2.5). The p roportion of external financing is very low (14 percent), most of which is in the form of grants (11 percent of overall financing). Table 2.5: Sources of Financing of Ministry of Health and Social Assistance, 2001 Internal External Total Transfers Own R evenues Loans Grants Estado (2001). Poorly Targeted Spending . The purpose of benefit -incidence analysis is to estimate how much different groups benefit from public resources devoted to health. We analyzed the incidence of government spending on health by consumption quintile. To conduct benefit -incidence analysis, we used three different kinds of information: (i) the utilization patterns of health care facilities by the Guatemalan population; (ii) the average cost to the government of providing health care services in different health care facilities; and (iii) the out -of-pocket payments of individuals who use different health care facilities.51 The data on utilization patterns and out -of-pocket expenditure came from ENCOVI/INE 2000 while data on the average cost of different health facilities came from MSPAS.52 Tables 2.6a and 2.6b show the utilization pattern of different health facilities. The poorest people use health facilities the least, regardless of what type of facility is in question.53 The poorest 40 percent of the population account for only 26 percent of the use of all facilities. Moreover, there is a general tendency for the population - even for the poorest - to use private rather than the public facilities as shown in Table 2.6b, which shows that 40 percent of all of the facilities visited during the month prior to the intervie w were private hospitals or clinics. Among private facilities, clinics are visited more often than hospitals. The poor quality of the services offered in public health facilities is usually considered to be a reason why they are underutilized. 51 See Demery (1997) and Deaton (1997) for descriptions of the conceptual and empirical issues involved in doing benefit - incidence analysis. 52 GETSA (2001). 53The utilization of health services in Guatemala is very low, with only 10 percent of the population visiting any healt h facility (public or private) during the month prior to the interview. The figure increases to 43 percent among those who were sick or had had an accident. 54% 16% 30% Curative Other Preventive 36Table 2.6 a: Utilization Pattern of Health Care Facilities - Proportion Of Visits per Health Facility Health Facility Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Total Hospital 11 16 19 29 26 100 Health center 23 22 22 25 13 100 Health post 25 26 29 15 5 100 Community center 26 21 19 19 15 100 Private Hospital and Clinic 3 9 12 22 53 100 All Facilities* 11 15 18 22 34 100 * Includes hospital IGSS, pharmacy, and other structures in addition to the ones above.

The cost of a visit to a hospital is fo ur times as high as the cost of a visit to a health center or community center, and is almost eight times as high as a visit to a health post.

On average, individuals in the highest quintile spend almost nine times more than those in the bottom quintile spend on all public health facilities. However, the ENCOVI/INE data indicate that most people do not pay anything for their visits to any public health facility. The proportion of peo ple who receive health care for free is highest in the poorest quintile (70 percent) but is still high in the richest quintile (59 percent). The higher average cost is therefore due to a limited number of individuals who pay for special and expensive treat ments in exceptional circumstances. 37Table 2.8: Average Out -of-Pocket Household Expenditure per Visit by Type of Health Care Facility Health Facility Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Zero Qtz % Zero Qtz Zero Qtz % Zero Qtz Zero 65% 33.8 65% 8.0 80% 12.2 71% 1.5 81% 6.7 74% Community center 0.8 79% 1.6 85% 5.6 50% 36.6 56% 23.1 36% 8.6 64% Any Public Facility *Percentage observations in the cell with a 0 value.

Table 2.9 summarizes how the net public health subsidy on health is distributed across different income groups. Table 2.9: Share of Net Public Subsidy Received by Each Consumption Quintile Health Facility ENCOVI 2000, Instituto Naciona l de Estad\u00edstica - Guatemala Overall, the poorest 40 percent of the population receive 35 percent of the total net health subsidy (public spending on health), while the richest 40 percent receive 42 percent. Concentration curves for the net health subsidy in each health facility are shown in Figure 2.3.54 54 Concentration curves illustrate the cumulative proportion of net subsidy received by the cumulat ive proportion of population ranked by per capita consumption. The 45 -degree line represents the \"perfect equality\" situation, in other words, the line that would be obtained if each consumption quintile received the same amount of health consumption throu gh public subsidy. 38Figure2.3: Concentration Curves of Net Public Subsidy on Health by Type of Health Facility Cumulative Proportion of Consumption Cumulative Proportion of Population Hospital Centro de Salud Centro Comunitario Puesto de Salud 0 .2 .4 .6 .8 10.2.4.6.81 Source: World Bank calculations using the ENCOVI 2000, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica - Guatemala Public hosp itals are the most regressive facilities. The poorest quintile receives only 13 percent of the net public subsidy, while the richest quintile receives 21 percent. This is due to the higher public cost of a visit to a hospital and the tendency of richer peo ple to use hospitals much more frequently than poorer people. Community centers and health posts, which provide basic health care services and are visited more frequently by poorer people, are the most progressive (the poorest quintile receives 39 percent and 40 percent of the public net subsidy to community centers and health posts respectively). Health centers, which are visited by people in the lowest four quintiles with a similar frequency, are in middle in terms of progressiveness . Overall, public s pending on health is slightly regressive, with the poorest 40 percent of the population receiving 35 percent of total subsidies and the richest 40 percent receiving 42 percent. The large overall degree of inequality is explained by the higher public cost o f visits to public hospitals, which skews the distribution of the net public health subsidy towards richer people who visit hospitals more than others. The system of payments in public facilities means that more costs are recovered from richer people who receive special and more expensive treatment more often than poorer people. However, most visits to any public health facility are free of charge for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, a policy that prevents the net public health su bsidy from being more equitably distributed. . The distribution of overall per capita expenditure in Guatemala is highly skewed towards richer households, which consume more than 20 times more than the poorest ones and account for more than 60 39percent of t otal national consumption. With a Gini coefficient of 57, Guatemala stands out as being a very unequal country.55 Table 2.10: Distribution of Total Consumption and Net Health Subsidy across Income Quintiles Q1 Q2 Q3 28% Source: World Bank calculations using the ENCOVI 2000, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica - Guatemala Two policy options are available to make public spending more progressive. The first is to shift resources away from hospitals towards community centers, health posts, and health centers, in other words, increasing spending on primary health care . The second is to introduce cost recovery mechanisms that charge different fees according to u sers' income levels. Large Inequalities in Private Spending on Health Care Table 2.11 shows out -of-pocket expenditures on health by individuals in different consumption quintiles, in absolute terms and as a proportion of total spending. On average in Guat emala , the poorest spend 30 times less than the richest (Table 2.11). The poorest individuals tend to allocate a very low proportion of their budget to health, and only as income increases significantly do they start consuming relatively more luxurious g oods and services like health care. Expenditure on health absorbs only 1.4 percent of the total consumption for individuals in the lowest quintile. The corresponding figure is 4.0 percent for individuals in the richest quintile.

Source: World Bank calculat ions using the ENCOVI 2000, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica - Guatemala Figure 2.4 shows the relationship between consumption of health care and total consumption (in logarithmic scale). The elasticity of consumption on health in total consumption is est imated do be around 1.5, confirming that health care is seen as a luxury good by most people in Guatemala. The proportion of total consumption that households spend on health care is between 2.5 percent and 3.0 percent for more than two -thirds of the popu lation. Only for the remaining third of the population does health care consumption start to increase, at a rapid pace, signaling that they have more resources available to \"invest\" in a luxury good such as health care. 55 World Bank calculations based on ENCOVI/INE 2000. 40Figure 2.4: Proportion of Total Exp enditure on Health by Percentile of Total Household Per Capita Expenditure proportion of health consumption percentiles of total pc consumpt0 20 40 60 80 1000.025.05.075 Source: World Bank calculations using the ENCOVI 2000, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica - Guatemala Households in rural areas spend three times less on health care than household s in urban areas and allocate less than 2 percent of their consumption budget to health (Table 2.12).

The proportion of total spending devoted to health is lowest in the Noroccidental region, where on average only 1.7 percent of total consumption is allocated to health. The Metropolitan region, the richest and most urbanized of all Guatemala, shows th e highest consumption of health (Table 2.13).

Health consumption includes every type of household spending on health, such as doctor visits, 41medicines, and transportation to health facilities. The distribution of private spending on health is even more unequal than that of consumption. The majority of health expenditure is concentrated in the hands of the richest individuals in the country. The richest 40 percent of the population contribute 94 percent of total private spending on health. Peop le in the poorest quintile account for less than 1 percent of total health expenditure.

ENCOVI data indicate that only 11 percent of Guatemalans have any kind of health insurance (Table 2.14). The majority of those who have insurance are affiliated with IGGS, while the rest have private insurance. The great majority of those who have either type of health insurance belong to the richest expenditure quintiles and live in urban areas. Only 3 percent of the poorest 40 percent of the populat ion have IGSS insurance. 42Table 2.14:Proportion of Individuals Affiliated with IGGS or by Health Insurance Total Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Urban Rural Private Insurance 2.2 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 8.0 5.0 1.0 IGSS 8.3 3.0 3.0 6.0 12.0 17.0 14.0 5.0 IGSS and privat e 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 Other 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 ENCOVI 2000, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica - Guatemala ENCOVI/INE data also show a large v ariation of monthly payments among those who have health insurance, a finding that underscores the fact that those who can afford insurance have both wider coverage and a better quality of services.

While not complete in terms of its coverage of health outcomes and processes , the ENCOVI 2000/INE is unique for Guatemala in terms of the representativeness of its sample , the availability of poverty variables and the richness of information on issues such as education, housing, anthropometry. 43The Un der-utilization of Health Services Public health facilities tend to be underutilized in Guatemala. If they can afford it, people often prefer to use private facilities. Poor people, on the other side, often tend to prefer to rely on assistance from other members of the household or on self medication . Children. Table 3.1 presents information on the type of health personnel who assist children affected by diarrhea or respiratory infections. Overall, half of these chil dren are treated by their fathers or other members of the household. The large majority of children in the lower consumption quintiles receive medication from non -medically qualified personnel. Only in the highest quintile do sick children have a higher pr obability of being seen by a doctor than by any other person. The incidence of non -indigenous children being treated by a doctor (32 percent) is almost twice as high as the incidence of indigenous children (18 percent). In urban areas, half of the childre n are taken either to a doctor or to other medically trained personnel. The corresponding figure is only 40 percent in rural areas. Only in the Metropolitan region are children assisted by doctors more than 50 percent of the number of times they are sick. 44Table 3.1: Treatment of Children with Diarrhea or Acute Respiratory Infections - Percentage of Sick Children Assisted by Different Personnel Non-medically trained Nurse or Promodor de Salud Doctor Father or Member of the Household Total 6.4 17.8 25.8 50.0 Consumption Quintile Q1 6.4 24.1 14.1 55.4 Q2 18.5 52.4 Q3 7.5 17.5 22.0 Q4 6.2 9.4 39.4 45.0 Q5 5.9 4.2 56.2 33.8 Poverty Status Non Poor 6.1 8.8 43.3 41.9 Poor 6.5 22.3 17.1 54.1 Extremely Poor 7.1 24.9 12.1 56.0 Ethnic ity Indigenous 7.9 20.7 18.3 53.1 K'iche 15.0 16.0 21.8 47.3 Q'ueqchi 7.7 22.8 14.6 55.0 Kaqchiquel 5.4 13.7 28.7 52.2 Mam 6.1 24.3 10.4 59.2 Other Mayan 5.9 26.4 15.8 52.0 Other Indigenous 12.6 33.3 17.2 36.9 Non-indigenous 4.9 15.2 32.7 47.2 Area Urban 6.3 7.8 44.6 41.3 Rural 6.4 18.1 53.6 Region Metropolitana 5.2 2.8 54.3 37.8 Norte 6.2 23.6 15.2 55.1 Nororiente 6.4 20.6 28.7 44.3 Suroriente 4.6 21.4 20.5 53.5 Central 4.3 11.9 27.0 56.8 Suroccidente 7.0 20.6 19.2 53.4 Noroccidente 10.5 24.7 13.4 51.5 Peten 4.5 29.6 17.8 48.1 Source: World Bank calculations using the ENCOVI 2000, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica - Guatemala One-half of all children with diarrhea or respiratory infections are treated inside their own homes rather than in any health facility (Table 3.2).

Health centers and health posts are the health facilities that are most frequently used for children in the poorest quintiles (Q1, Q2, and Q3), while children in the highest consumption quintiles use mostly private hospitals and clinics.

Table 3.3 presents the proportion of the Guatemalan population who received either curative or preventive health care from different types of health personnel during the month before the interview. In contrast to the patterns ob served for children, a large proportion of individuals (36 percent) is assisted by a doctor. Another large share of the population relies on self -medication or the assistance of other individuals within the household. The proportion of individuals who are treated by doctors varies significantly across consumption quintiles (13.6 percent among the poorest 20 percent of the population and almost 60 percent among the richest 20 percent of the population). Poor and extremely poor individuals often rely on treat ment from other members of their households or on self -medication. One-fifth of extremely poor individuals do nothing to ameliorate their illnesses. There appears to be a significant difference in the behavior of individuals by ethnicity. Doctors treat 44 percent of non - indigenous people and only 24 percent of indigenous people. Indigenous people tend to rely more often than non -indigenous people on the help of other members of their households, on self -medication, and on 46non-medically trained practitioners .. In urban areas, more than half of the population sees a doctor. In rural areas, only a quarter of the population sees a doctor, while almost one -half of the population receive treatment within their households or rely on self -medication.

The type and quality of prenatal care that a woman receives during her pregnancy and delivery are very important factors for her health and the health of her children. Therefore, these aspects of health c are are important elements in evaluating the health conditions of any given country. Table 3.5 displays information on prenatal visits in Guatemala. Almost 80 percent of women with children made at least one prenatal visit in Guatemala, a proportion that reaches almost 90 percent among women in the highest consumption quintile and falls to 66 percent among women in the lowest consumption quintile, and to 64 percent among extremely poor mothers. More than a quarter of women in 48rural areas (27 percent) had no prenatal care at all, compared to half of that percentage in urban areas (13 percent). Even higher percentages of women than in rural areas in general have received no prenatal care in the Noroccidente, Suroccidente, and Norte regions. Overall, most pre natal visits are carried out by doctors with the rest mostly being carried out by traditional midwives ( comadromas ). A low proportion of the population is visited by nurses or non -medically trained personnel (11 percent and 2 percent). However, there is an important difference between the poor and the non-poor. Almost 90 percent of the richest women receive assistance from doctors, while the corresponding figure is only 20 percent among the poorest women who, in the majority of the cases, are attended by mi dwives. In urban areas, twice as many women are visited by a doctor as in rural areas (78 percent vs. 35 percent). The same pattern is observed among indigenous and non -indigenous women. Moreover, the percentage of indigenous women who see a midwife is mor e than double the percentage of non-indigenous women. In the Metropolitan region, 94 percent of women are assisted by doctors. 49Table 3.5: Patterns of Prenatal Visits and Treatment of Pregnant Women Had Prenatal Checks (% of Non -Pregnant) Who Did the Ch ecks (Percentage of Women Who Had Prenatal Checks) Never Yes Non-Medically Trained Midwife Nurse or Promotor Doctor Father or other family member Total 21.3 75.6 2.4 33.7 11.0 52.4 0.6 Consumption Quintile Q1 15.7 19.5 0.7 72.0 2.6 45.4 15.6 36.2 0.2 Q3 22.7 77.3 1.8 36.3 12 49.3 0.6 Q4 10.2 89.8 1.3 20.3 8.6 69.8 0.9 Q5 8.8 91.2 2.0 6.1 2.5 89.1 0.2 Poverty Status Non Poor 11.1 89.0 1.6 16.1 6.3 75.5 0.6 Poor 28.9 71.1 3.0 47.8 14.8 33.9 0.5 Extremely Poor 35.9 64.1 4.8 61.1 14.7 18.6 1.0 Ethnicity Indigenous 26.2 69.8 4.2 49.2 12.7 32.9 1.0 K'iche 17.3 77.6 3.2 49.7 9.3 37.1 0.7 Q'ueqchi 26.6 69.0 10.3 33.2 26.1 29.8 0.6 Kaqchiquel 11.0 82.8 1.2 47.0 8.0 43.7 - Mam 35.1 62.7 4.9 59.5 10.3 23.0 2.4 Other Mayan 40.6 57.2 3.6 56.9 13.3 24.4 1.9 Other Indigenous 4.6 81.1 0.0 5.5 43.6 51.0 - Non-indigenous 17.3 80.3 1.1 9.8 Area Urban 13.3 86.7 1.4 14.4 5.4 78.4 0.4 Rural 26.8 14.8 0.7 Metropolitana 7 23.8 30.8 38.0 0.4 Nororiente 24.9 75.1 3.3 21.3 14.9 60.4 0.0 Suroriente 16.6 83.4 0.8 40.4 13.7 45.1 0.0 Central 10.8 89.2 0.5 35.4 8.4 55.3 0.3 Suroccidente 27.1 72.9 1.4 44 10.9 42.9 0.8 Noroccidente 35.5 64.5 4.0 61.1 10.7 22.8 1.4 Peten 19.1 80.9 2.5 51.7 14.3 30.8 0.7 Note:Pregnant Women are excluded in order to avoid censoring.

Both indigenous and non -indigenous women had normal deliveries without complications in 80 percent of the cases. The difference arises in the remaining 20 percent of deliveries; while non -indigenous women tend to have more cesarean deliveries, indigenous people more often have n ormal deliveries with complications.

Poor conditions and a lack of equipment were common complaints in a number of anthropological studies that asked clients and potential clients what they found most unsatisfactory about the way in which public health services are organized.58 Other complaints were: (i) a lack of medicine, which means that patients have to fill their prescriptions at pharmacies; (ii) the practice of conducting prenatal clinics, immunizations, and consultations all at different times, which is inconvenient for mothers with many children who require different kinds of medical attention; (iii) poor interaction between patients and health care personnel; and (iv) a lack of personnel and the rapid rotation of staff, wh ich makes it difficult for a client to establish a rapport with any one provider. The Qualitative and Poverty Exclusion Study found that the most important reasons for not seeking treatment were: (i) the high cost of visits to health providers;(ii) a lac k of transportation to other villages' health facilities; and (iii) discrimination due to the respondents' indigenous ethnicity or inability to speak Spanish. The ENCOVI/INE 2000 data indicate that in the majority of cases people do not seek health care treatment because they believe that their sickness or accident is not important enough to need specialized attention (Tables 3.14a, 3.14b, and 3.14c). The second most important reason for not seeking treatment is due to financial issues; people report that they do not have enough money to afford the visit. This is the case more frequently among the poorest three quintiles and in rural areas (about 30 percent), while there is no big difference between indigenous and non -indigenous people. The long distances to health facilities are another important reason why people in rural areas and the very poor do not seek health care (9 percent and 12 percent respectively).

Although modern medicine is becoming increasingly dominant, traditional beliefs a bout sickness and health continue to inform rural Guatemalans' health ideas and choices. For example, as in other rural areas of Latin America, the indigenous people believe illness is caused by an imbalance of hot and cold. Therefore, they believe that a treatment will only be effective if the prescribed medicines or food are of the opposite temperature to the disorder so that the hot -cold balance can be re -established.59 Many people use both traditional and modern medicine, which they perceive as being com plementary rather than in conflict with one another.60 Recent findings suggest that, with respect to the treatment of children's illnesses, modern medicine is currently used more frequently than traditional remedies and healers.61 59 Logan (1973). 60 Cosminsky and Scrimshaw (1980). 61 Heuveline and Goldman (1998). 57Quality and Access to Servi ces Quality and access to services are important determinants of individuals ' health outcomes. In Guatemala poor quality and limited access are often the main reason for the observed underutilization of services. QPES . The Qualit ative Poverty and Exclusion Study QPES, through a detailed analysis of 10 villages, highlights important factors related to access to health services that support and enrich our results from the household survey. In particular, in most of the villages, the re are no health services, but the midwives and informants report that the costs of traveling to access services in other localities are often prohibitive. In one village, individuals reported that they rarely go to the doctor in the municipal capital bec ause it is expensive and because it is difficult to get there due to the poor quality of their access road. In another village, people felt that they had experienced \"discrimination\" while being served or receiving medicines due to their indigenous ethnic ity or their inability to speak Spanish.62 Waiting Times . Tables 3.15 and 3.16 present information on the average waiting time at different health facilities. Waiting times are longer in IGSS hospitals and public hospitals and are shorter in pharmacies and private facilities. Waiting times are longer in rural areas for public hospitals, IGSS hospitals, and private facilities, of which there are not very many in rural areas. In contrast, waiting times are longer in urban areas for health posts and health cent ers and community centers, which are more common in rural areas.

Similarly, indigenous people on average wait less than non -indigenous people. This is explained b y the fact that the poorer and indigenous people tend to use less -crowded facilities (in other words, health centers, health posts, and community centers) more often than better -off individuals and the non - indigenous. 62 QPES (2001). 58Table 3.16: Average Waiting Time by Selected Household Characteristics (Minutes) Total 46 Consumption Quintile Q1 38 Q2 42 Q3 48 Q4 54 Q5 45 Poverty Status Non Poor 48 All Poor 44 Extremely Poor 40 Ethnicity Indigenous 43 K'iche 41 Q'ueqchi 33 Kaqchiquel 51 Mam 39 Other Mayan 51 Other Indigenous 50 Non-indigenous 48 Area Urban 51 Rural 42 Region Metropolitana 55 Norte 47 Nororiente 37 Suroriente 50 Central 52 Suroccidente 41 Noroccidente 32 Peten 40 Source: World Bank calculations using the ENCOVI 20 00, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica - Guatemala Traveling Times . On average, children have to travel for about an hour to reach public hospitals. In practice, this means up to 75 minutes if they come from rural areas and only half that time if they are from urban areas. Community centers are the health facilities closest to Guatemalan children in rural areas, while health centers, health posts, and pharmacies are the closest to children in urban areas.

Using this standard, only 41 percent of all children in Guatemala have access to health facilities. Access is more limited for children in rural areas (only 36 percent) than for children in urban areas (52 percent). Similarly, more than hal f of the children in the highest consumption quintile (58 percent) have access to health centers as opposed to a much lower proportion of children in the bottom quintiles (34 percent). Non -poor children have more access to health care facilities (48 percen t) than do extremely poor children (34 percent) There is no large difference in access by ethnic group.

Results reflect a pattern similar to that observed for children. Hospitals appear to be the least accessible health facilities, especially for individuals living in rural areas who need about an hour and a half to get to one. 60Table 3.19: Average Traveling Time by Type of Health F acility (Minutes) Public Hospital IGSS Hospital Private Hospital or Clinic Health Post or Health Center Communit y Center Pharmacy Other Total Total 63 51 47 41 25 38 25 45 Urban Areas 42 50 36 26 28 17 29 35 Rural Areas 80 56 64 47 24 49 24 54 Source: World Bank calculations using the ENCOVI 2000, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica - Guatemala Table 3.20 applies the definition of \"access\" to health facilities to the Guatemalan population and shows results disaggregated by selected characteristics. Only 11 percent of the total population who use health facilities live within one hour of the facility. The proportion is higher for people living in urban areas and in the highest consumption quintiles, while it is lower than 10 percent for individuals in the lower quintiles and for people living in rural areas. Almost 9 percent of indigenous people have access to health facilities as opposed to 12 percent of non -indigenous people. By comparing Table 3.20 with Table 3.18, access to health facilities would see m to be much lower for adults than for children. The results seem puzzling, as the children in the survey come from the same families as the adults. A possible reason may lie in the different use of health facilities: as observed in Table 3.3 and Table 3.1, adults tend to use doctors or health -trained personnel more frequently than children, who instead rely on treatment by their father or other members of the household. Child morbidity may, therefore, be considered as less serious than that of adults. Thus, if the family would have to travel a long distance to take the child to the closest health center, this may dissuade the parents from taking their children to see a doctor. As a result, the children who are actually treated in a health fac ility may tend to live closer to health facilities. 61Table 3.20: Access to Health Facilities Proportion of Adults with Access to the Health Facility Traveling Time less than 60 Minutes Total 10.7 Consumption Quintile Q1 5.3 Q2 7.0 Q3 10.2 Q4 11.8 Q5 19.2 Poverty Status Non Poor 15.3 All Poor 7.1 Extremely Poor 5.2 Ethnicity Indigenous 8.7 K'iche 11.7 Q'ueqchi 9.2 Kaqchiquel 8.4 Mam 6.4 Other Mayan 6.9 Other Indigenous 16.3 Non-indigenous 12.2 Area Urban 14.4 Rural 8.3 Region Metropolitana 14.5 Norte 8.4 Nororiente 12.3 Suroriente 9.7 Central 10.5 Suroccidente 9.7 Noroccidente 7.8 Peten 8.8 Source: World Bank calculations using the ENCOVI 2000, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica - Guatemala IV: Discussion Guatema la's poor health indicators are due, in part, to problems that are outside of the control of public health authorities and not likely to be solved in the short run. These problems include: (i) widespread poverty due to limited household resource availabili ty; (ii) poor environmental conditions; (iii) the limited availability of private sector providers of an adequate quality; and (iv) a general lack of knowledge about the benefits of modern medicine, especially among the indigenous population. Changing thes e underlying factors will require effective economic programs to combat poverty (focused mostly on those rural areas with a large indigenous population) and expanded educational investments. 62Nevertheless, there are some actions that the government can and should take in the short - and medium - turn to improve health indicators and reduce inequality among areas and socioeconomic groups. The relative youth of the Guatemalan population means that, for the foreseeable future, the major problems confronting the he alth sector will be those of the young instead of the old. The widespread poverty in the country means that the government's short -term priorities should be to combat the infectious and parasitic diseases associated with poverty, which are still more preva lent than non - communicable diseases. Increasing knowledge and access to effective family planning methods, especially in rural areas and among the poor and the indigenous population, would both reduce population growth and improve reproductive and child he alth indicators. Given the limited resources currently assigned to health, the government should ensure that the planned increase in resources to the health sector does indeed materialize. The program to extend coverage of basic health services should be evaluated carefully, and the program should either be scaled -up or redesigned depending on the results of that evaluation. The frequency of blood transfusion as a cause of AIDS infection makes it essential to reform the national system of blood control. In the medium -term, the government should attempt to mobilize additional resources for health and should take additional steps to improve the efficiency and quality of services offered. Some ways to do this include: (i) introducing a system of referral and counter -referral; (ii) charging IGGS beneficiaries for services that they receive in MSPAS facilities; (iii) allowing non -IGGS population to use IGGS facilities and charging the client, rather than MSPAS, for the use; and (iv) considering contracting out c ertain services within IGGS and MSPAS to private services (in addition to those contracted to NGOs to expand coverage of basic health care). As the population ages and the epidemiological transition progresses, more resources should be allocated to attempt s to cure and prevent non -communicable and degenerative diseases. In addition, two policy options are available to make public spending more progressive. The first is to move public resources away from hospitals towards community centers, health posts, and health centers (in other words, increasing the share of resources devoted to primary health care) . The second is to introduce cost recovery mechanisms that charge different fees according to each user's income. The current policy of providing services fre e-of-charge in all type of public facilities benefits the rich more the poor, who tend to attend community centers, health posts, and health centers where visits cost less in terms of both time and money . Increasing the total amount of resources invested i n the health sector is a key recommendation because, in this way, more can be spent on preventive and primary care to improve basic services without having to reduce the absolute amount of resources available to hospitals. 63References Amnesty Internati onal, 1998, Guatemala: All the Truth, Justice for All, AMR 34/02/98; also on the web at: http://www.web.amnesty.org/ai.nsf/index/AMR340021998 .
