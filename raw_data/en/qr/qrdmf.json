Students in this track complete 61 credit hours of professional nursing course work. Prior to entry, students must complete approximately 59 semester credit hours of prerequisite courses in the humanities and biological, physical and behavioral sciences to provide a foundation for growth in the nursing major. Prerequisite coursework may be completed at any regionally accredited college or university. Current and former Texas A&M students and prospective transfer students are welcome to apply. An accelerated [second-degree BSN](../second-bsn/index.html) degree track is delivered at the Round Rock campus. Applicants may only apply and be considered for one program and/or campus location each application cycle. Graduating high school students may not apply. An applicant must qualify as a transfer applicant, per the Texas A&M University definition: A student who has earned college credit after high school graduation during a fall or spring term. This applies to students who may have earned college credits and/or an associate degree during the course of their high school program. Those with more than 90 credit hours or a completed degree are encouraged to consider other options, such as completing a degree in the current college/school and then consider applying to the accelerated second-degree BSN. Upon completion of course requirements, graduates are eligible to sit for the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) to earn their RN license. The School of Nursing will guide students through the Texas RN licensure process during their last semester. The following programs may lead to a professional license or certification that is required for employment. Professional licensure/certification requirements vary from state to state, which may affect a student's ability to apply for a professional license/certification upon the completion of the program. The U.S. Department of Education regulation, [34 CFR 668.43 (a) (5) (v)](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2019-23129/p-981), requires an institution to disclose whether the program will fulfill educational requirements for licensure or certification for each state. The administrative departments that offer the programs have made the following determination regarding their curriculum. |Program||Meets State or U.S. Territory Requirements||Does not meet||A determination has not been made| |Bachelor of Science in Nursing (Traditional, Second Degree)||TX, AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, TN, UT, VT, VA, WA, WV, WI, WY, District of Columbia (DC), Puerto Rico (PR), Virgin Islands (VI), American Samoa (AS), Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Guam (GU), Marshall Islands (MH)||Federated States of Micronesia (FM), Palau (PW)| |Master of Science in Nursing-Family Nurse Practitioner||TX, AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, TN, UT, VT, VA, WA, WV, WI, WY, District of Columbia (DC), Puerto Rico (PR), Virgin Islands (VI), American Samoa (AS), Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Guam (GU)||Marshall Islands (MH), Federated States of Micronesia (FM), Palau (PW)| |Post-Graduate Certificate in Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner||TX, AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, TN, UT, VA, WA, WV, WI, WY, District of Columbia (DC)||Puerto Rico (PR), Virgin Islands (VI), American Samoa (AS), Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Guam (GU), Marshall Islands (MH), Federated States of Micronesia (FM), Palau (PW)Federated States of Micronesia (FM), Palau (PW)| | | We recommend students contact the appropriate state licensing agency in their state or the state where they intend to work to seek the most up-to-date information about state licensure/certification requirements before beginning the program.

Application Deadlines Step 1: is the only application required for internal applicants. Internal applicants are current Texas A&M University undergraduate students in a non-nursing major on either the College Station or Galveston campuses. This includes students on Blinn Team. Internal applicants must meet specific requirements to apply to the upper division sequence and should apply following the internal transfer process which includes completing a NursingCAS application. Current students who will be earning a bachelor's degree prior to the start date should follow the external transfer application instructions.| Step 2: ApplyTexas Application External Transfer |Apply Texas application dates vary for international applicants. See the | Prerequisite Coursework Courses may be in progress during the application cycle, however, all courses must be completed with a minimum grade of \"C\" by the first class day. Please see below for a list of required courses. All courses are subject to approval by the School of Nursing when the student applies for admission. In addition to the required prerequisites listed below, students receiving a bachelor's degree from Texas A&M must satisfy the coursework requirements of the Texas A&M University [Core Curriculum](http://core.tamu.edu). By the application deadline, applicants must have completed a minimum of 40 prerequisite course credit hours of the 59 hours required. Of those 40, twelve (12) credit hours must be from the following Nursing Science courses: Lifespan Psychology (3), Nutrition (3), Texas A&M Core Math (3 or 4), Chemistry (4), Anatomy & Physiology (8) and Microbiology (4). Students may repeat prerequisite courses, however, grades earned from both the first and a second attempt will be used to determine the final GPA. Any additional attempts will not be considered. If a grade of \"C\" is not earned within 2 attempts, the student will not be eligible for admission. Nursing Science courses are in italics. |Subject||Course Name||Texas Common Course Number||Semester Credit Hours||TAMU Course| |[Core Curriculum](http://core.tamu.edu) [Core Curriculum](http://core.tamu.edu) *PBSI completed prior to spring 2022 **Statistics requirement effective for students entering fall 2020 term 1 Two history courses are required, one of which may be dedicated to Texas history. 2 Second degree and RN-to-BSN applicants may meet requirement by taking any humanities course that meets Texas A&M core. 3 Students applying from other Texas public institutions may take up to three hours of math which meet that institution's core curriculum requirements. Out-of-state or private university applicants must have three hours of math from the Texas A&M [Core Curriculum.](http://core.tamu.edu/) Proficiency in a foreign language is required to graduate from Texas A&M. This requirement can be met by having completed two years of the same foreign language in high school, by completing two semesters of the same foreign language at the university level or by demonstrating proficiency in a foreign language by examination. For questions about what courses may or may not transfer from other institutions, see the [Texas A&M University Transfer Course Equivalency Matrix](https://howdy.tamu.edu/uPortal/p/tce-ui.ctf1/max/render.uP#!/inst). If a course is not listed in the matrix or is listed as \"TRNS\" (transfer by title), email [nursingadmissions@tamu.edu](mailto:nursingadmissions@tamu.edu) to identify the appropriate course of action to determine course transferability. Admission Criteria It is strongly recommended that applicants present a GPA above 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale). Preference is given to students completing the majority of their coursework in Brazos County in the state of Texas. Applicants are evaluated based on the following criteria: - Prerequisite Coursework GPA. Graduate coursework will not be considered. - Nursing Science GPA from nutrition, anatomy & physiology, microbiology, chemistry, lifespan growth & development and Texas A&M University core equivalent math course [HESI Admissions Assessment Exam](index.html#tab-panel-10)score - Timed verbal responses and written assessments - Community service - Leadership/involvement in extracurricular and/or professional activities - TOEFL score, required of international applicants only - History of withdrawals, repeats or failures will place applicant at a disadvantage Repeated Course Policy Students may repeat prerequisite courses, however, grades earned from both the first and a second attempt will be used to determine the final GPA. Any additional attempts will not be considered. If a grade of \"C\" is not earned within two attempts, the student will not be eligible for admission. When deciding to repeat a course, consider the impact the course will make on your GPA. Courses from the Nursing Science prerequisites (Nutrition, Lifespan Developmental Psychology, Chemistry, Texas A&M Core Math, Anatomy & Physiology, and Microbiology) may make an impact on your GPA when repeated, versus courses repeated that are non-nursing science prerequisites (i.e. English, History, etc.). For example, repeating Biology where one earns a \"C\" the first attempt and an \"A\" the second attempt, may not significantly impact the prerequisite GPA since this calculation includes all grades for completed prerequisite coursework. Applicants must consider the time and cost of repeating courses as it can be difficult to greatly improve one's GPA. Please visit [How to Calculate GPA ](https://registrar.tamu.edu/Transcripts-Grades/How-to-Calculate-GPA) for assistance in determining your prerequisite coursework and Nursing Science course GPA. Criminal Background Check Criminal background checks are required of all applicants. Prior criminal convictions may cause one to be ineligible for licensure as a registered nurse. Applicants will be responsible for obtaining a background check and paying appropriate fees to be fingerprinted for the Texas Board of Nursing. The board will provide applicants with notification of their eligibility (or not) for future RN licensure following their successful completion of a nursing degree. Results are typically returned within six weeks of fingerprinting if there is no record of criminal history. In order to apply for licensure as an RN, students must declare any [eligibility issues](https://www.bon.texas.gov/licensure_eligibility.asp.html) with the Texas Board of Nursing. The board will notify applicants who may not meet conditions for future RN licensure after results of the fingerprinting are received. Individuals who have significant criminal history will likely be ineligible for licensure. If there is any history of criminal charges, alcohol or drug abuse or mental health concerns, students must file a [declaratory order](https://www.bon.texas.gov/forms_declaratory_order.asp.html) petition to the Board of Nursing. The time required to review a petition can be lengthy so students are encouraged to begin the process early in the application process. An offer of admission from the School of Nursing will not be final until the completion of the background check with results that are deemed favorable. Admission may be denied or rescinded based on the review. Application Requirements [NursingCAS application](https://nursingcas.liaisoncas.org/apply/)and nonrefundable application fee. - Official college transcripts from each institution attended sent to NursingCAS.

Score Requirements A minimum score of 75 percent is required for each of the component sections noted above. Applicants who do not achieve the minimum score in any one section will be denied based on test score deficiency. There is one exception to this requirement for applicants who have not completed both A&P courses at the time of testing and do not achieve the 75 percent minimum score. These applicants may be allowed to move forward in the admissions process as long as they achieve a minimum cumulative score of 82. (Calculate this by averaging the five sections: math, anatomy and physiology, reading comprehension, grammar and vocabulary). Note: The average cumulative score for most admitted students is 90 percent or greater. Score Reporting Scores MUST be sent from Elsevier directly to the Texas A&M University School of Nursing to be received no later than the posted deadline for each degree. For those who register to take the exam through the link above (under Exam Registration), our Department ID is embedded in the request; therefore, scores will be received electronically within 24 hours of the date of the exam. Students may take the exam through another university which is certainly acceptable. Be sure to take all sections required by the Texas A&M School of Nursing. Students who take the exam through another school must request an official HESI score report be sent to Texas A&M University School of Nursing. Request an electronic copy of the report be sent through the preferred method: [nursingadmissions@tamu.edu](mailto:nursingadmissions@tamu.edu). Only electronic copies sent from Elsevier are acceptable. All students, regardless of how they take the exam, must also upload a copy of their unofficial score report (which is available through [Elsevier Evolve](https://evolve.elsevier.com/cs/)) to the NursingCAS portal. If students have taken the exam more than once, they must upload all attempts. In the application, go to Program Materials, select the program to which you are applying and then upload the unofficial report in the Documents tab. Self-reported scores will be audited. Any student that does not provide accurate information or purposely provides misleading information such as not reporting all score reports will have their admission application revoked and will be removed from consideration for admission. Students Requesting Disability Accommodations Students that require exam accommodations due to a disability-related need (such as extra time, reader, screen magnification, etc.) will need to submit their accommodation requests when scheduling their exam time through the test administrator (Prometric). Exam Study Guides To purchase a study guide, call 1.800.545.2522 and request the Evolve Reach Testing and Remediation Admission Assessment Exam Review or go to [Elsevier](https://www.us.elsevierhealth.com/admission-assessment-exam-review-9780323353786.html). Frequently Asked Questions Q. Are study materials available for the exam? A. Yes. Elsevier has [study materials](https://evolve.elsevier.com/studentlife/hesi-next-generation.html) available for purchase. Q. What sections of the exam does the School of Nursing require? A. The Texas A&M School of Nursing requires the following five didactic components: math, reading comprehension, vocabulary and general knowledge, grammar, anatomy and physiology.
