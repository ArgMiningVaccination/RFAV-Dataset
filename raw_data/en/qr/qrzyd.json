Until now, people receiving the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines have been asked to wait for 15 minutes before leaving the vaccine centre in case of serious allergic reaction. This 15 minute wait has now been suspended for adults after 1st doses, 2nd doses and boosters. Why is this changing? Because of the Omicron variant, the booster programme for adults is being speeded up. We now have much more experience with giving these vaccines to millions of people and the rate of serious allergic reactions is very low (around 5-10 per million doses). People are not normally observed for 15 minutes after other vaccinations. Who is advising this change? The change has been advised by the four UK Chief Medical Officers, and has the support of the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). What should I do when I attend for vaccination? Please make sure you tell the vaccine centre if: you have a history of allergic reactions, particularly to other vaccines, or if you had an immediate reaction after a previous dose. (A family history of allergies is not a risk factor.) If so, you may be advised to stay for the 15 minutes; you have previously fainted following vaccination. As with any vaccine, you must not drive for 15 minutes after the vaccine - this is because of the risk of fainting. If you do faint, stay flat on your back with your legs raised. If this doesn't make you feel better, then call for help. Otherwise, you will be able to leave the centre straight after your vaccine as long as you feel OK.What happens if I do get symptoms of an allergic reaction? Keep this flyer handy. You should look out for the following 'ABC' symptoms: These symptoms typically happen within 15 minutes of vaccination. If you experience any of these, call out for help and ring 999 immediately (or ask someone to do this for you). The following symptoms are NOT a serious allergic reaction, but imply a more mild reaction: Swollen lips, face or eyes Itchy skin rash eg hives Information correct at time of publication.
