You must be at least 12 years old to get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 18 years old to get the Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. You should wait 15 to 30 minutes before leaving the vaccine site so your vaccine provider can help you if you do have an allergic reaction or other side effects. While you wait, you can sign up for vsafe to report any side effects: [vsafe.cdc.gov](https://vsafe.cdc.gov/en/). You or your vaccine provider can also report side effects to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): [https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html](https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html). Call 911 if you have an allergic reaction after leaving the clinic. Signs of an allergic reaction include: difficulty breathing, swelling of your face and throat, fast heartbeat, a bad rash all over your body, dizziness, and weakness. Data shows it is uncommon to be re-infected with COVID-19 in the 90 days after you were infected, so you might have some protection (called natural immunity). However, we don't know how long natural immunity might last. People who currently have COVID-19 should wait to get vaccinated until they feel better and their isolation period is finished, if possible. People who were recently exposed to COVID-19 should also wait to get the vaccine until after their quarantine period, if they can safely quarantine away from other people. If there is a high risk they could infect others, they may be vaccinated during their quarantine period to prevent spreading the disease. The vaccines are very effective at preventing COVID-19. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the vaccines for emergency use and found no serious safety concerns.
