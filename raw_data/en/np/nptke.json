Jobs are up, the deficit is down, and Alberta's economy is growing faster than anywhere in Canada . Budget 2018 is focused squarely on extending the recovery to all Albertans and continuing to build a more resilient, diversified and stable economy that is less vulnerable to oil price shocks - a recovery that is built to last for working people . The plan is built on three pillars: F Diversifying the Economy - fighting for market access, adding value to our energy products and supporting new and developing industries . F Protecting Vital Public Services - making sure loved ones get the care they need, young people get the best education possible, and no one is left behind . F Returning to Balance - investing tax dollars where they are needed most, eliminating waste, and controlling spending to return to balance by 2023-24 . Diversifying the Economy A growing and diverse economy benefits all Albertans . It supports job creation and helps move Alberta off the resource revenue rollercoaster . While government continues to fight for market access, Budget 2018 includes a range of initiatives to add value to our energy products and support developing industries . These programs stimulate growth across sectors, support job creation and open doors for entrepreneurs to start and expand a business . DIVERSIFICATION WITHIN THE ENERGY SECTOR As we work to get needed pipelines built to access new markets and get better value for our resources, we will also do more to add value to our resources right here at home . F $1 billion for partial upgrading over eight years beginning in 2019-20, which includes a variety of tools such as loan guarantees and grants . Partial upgrading allows oil sands bitumen to flow through pipelines more easily, enhancing oil sands industry competitiveness by reducing costs, increasing pipeline capacity and enabling more refineries to process Alberta bitumen product . This will support construction of two to five partial upgrading facilities, representing up to $5 billion in private investment, 4,000 jobs during construction and 200 full-time jobs during operation .8 OVERVIEW FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21F $500 million in royalty credits to initiate a second phase of the successful Petrochemicals Diversification Program (PDP) that ensures companies have access to the natural gas liquids they need to grow private investment in Alberta-based natural gas processing . The intended outcome of the program is one to three world scale petrochemical facilities in Alberta, resulting in approximately $6 billion worth of new investment, creating roughly 4,000 new jobs during construction and over 200 full-time jobs once operations begin . F $500 million for a Petrochemical Feedstock Infrastructure Program that encourages the construction of new extraction facilities on major pipelines to recover natural gas liquids feedstock . It is intended to encourage the development of one or two natural gas mid-stream projects to support liquids extraction with a focus on ethane extraction . The program will be a combination of loan guarantees and grants . DIVERSIFICATION ACROSS OUR ECONOMY While we work to diversify our traditional strengths in the energy sector, we will also diversify by helping other sectors of the economy grow . F $60 million a year for two successful tax credit programs that are being extended to 2021-22 - the Alberta Investor and the Capital Investment Tax Credits . They will continue to foster new investment, encourage innovation, and accelerate growth in new industries . These two programs have already supported more than $1 billion in private sector capital projects . F $20 million a year by 2020-21 for a new Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit that will attract more tech entrepreneurs to Alberta, and retain Alberta's homegrown talent to inspire the next generation of tech innovators . F 3,000 new post-secondary technology spaces over the next five years and new scholarships to support technology and other emerging sectors like life sciences, clean technology and health innovation . These investments will help create a recovery that is built to last for working people, ensuring that Albertans get the full value for our energy resources . At the same time, promoting economic diversification and the creation of good paying jobs .Budget 2018 launches the Interactive Digital Media T ax Credit.9 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 20 OVERVIEW Protecting Vital Public Services During the downturn, government supported Albertans by investing in healthcare, education and social services and taking steps to make life more affordable for families . While the economy is now recovering, government continues to focus on these vital services and ensuring that no Albertan gets left behind . MAKING SURE OUR LOVED ONES GET THE CARE THEY NEED Making continued investments to support the delivery of publicly funded health programs and services . This includes capital investments in health care such as building high-quality health facilities such as the Calgary Cancer Centre and the new hospital in Edmonton and bringing on-line hundreds of continuing care beds in 2018-19 to support the shift to better community-based care . YOUNG PEOPLE GET THE BEST EDUCATION POSSIBLE Alberta's young population continued to grow through the recession, so the province is fully funding enrolment growth in the K-12 education system and reducing school fees . For post-secondary students, government is extending the tuition freeze for the fourth year to keep education more affordable, and investing in 3,000 new technology spaces and providing new scholarships for technology and other emerging sectors so Alberta's talent can thrive and prepare for the jobs of the future . ENSURING NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND The Early Learning and Child Care Centre program will create an additional 4,500 affordable child care spaces that help working parents . The Alberta Child Benefit (ACB) makes life more affordable for Albertans by providing direct financial assistance to lower-income families and the Alberta Family Employment Tax Credit (AFETC) helps lower-and middle-income working families support their children . Approximately $328 million in ACB and AFETC benefits are provided in 2018-19 . A minimum wage of $15 per hour will help make sure that no Albertan has to stop at the food bank on their way home from work . Government continues to make significant investments so Albertans with disabilities have timely and accessible services so that they are supported in leading meaningful lives in inclusive, welcoming communities . A review of the Persons with Developmental Disabilities program will ensure that Albertans living with disabilities get the right supports .The Alberta Child Benefit makes life more affordable.10 OVERVIEW FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21Budget 2018 focuses tax dollars where they are needed most to return to balance by 2023-24.Returning to Balance When the price of oil collapsed, the recession hit Alberta hard . The recovery in Alberta's economy and a growing population will increase government revenues over the path to balance . However, this is not enough . It is not until 2019-20 that government revenues of $50 .6 billion are forecast to surpass the $49 .4 billion in revenue reached in 2013-14 . The government will focus the investment of tax dollars where they are needed most, eliminate waste, control spending and find efficiencies to balance the budget by 2023-24: F Managing public sector compensation which is over half of government's annual operating expense by: Reaching practical agreements with labour unions; Continuing with a salary freeze on non-union employees in the public sector; Cutting the salaries and eliminating perks and bonuses for some of the highest paid executives of Alberta's agencies, boards and commissions; and Keeping the size of the Alberta Public Service flat . F Keeping health spending growth below growth in population and inflation . Health spending is more than 40% of government's annual operating expense . F Developing a new fiscal relationship with municipalities where grants under the Municipal Sustainability Initiative (MSI) are adjusted while the province returns to balance and a new infrastructure grant program to replace the MSI is developed, with a funding formula based on revenue sharing . F Returning capital spending to normal levels as the economic recovery becomes broad-based . F Dissolving or amalgamating government agencies, boards and commissions . F T ransforming corporate services across government including communications, finance, human resources and information technologies to deliver better services at a lower cost . F Continuing to tightly manage discretionary spending across government . pdf named: B18_FP_OVW_B18surdef_chrt.pdf Budget 2018 Overview Section Budget 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 20 OVERVIEW pdf named: B18_FP_OVW_kfm_tb.pdf Budget 2018 Overview Section Budget 2018 Key Fiscal Metrics (billions of dollars) 2016-17 2017-18 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 Actual Budget Total Revenue 42.3 44.9 46.9 47.9 50.6 53.8 Total Expense 53.1 54.9 55.9 56.2 57.8 59.8 Risk Adjustment - (0.5) - (0.5) (0.7) (1.0) Surplus / (Deficit) (10.8) (10.5) (9.1) (8.8) (7.9) (7.0) Other Key Metrics: Capital / Other Non-financial Assets 49.4 52.7 52.0 53.8 55.3 56.8 Heritage Fund Year-end Balances 15.4 15.7 15.6 16.0 16.3 16.6 Net Financial Assets / Net Debt (8.9) (22.6) (20.3) (30.5) (39.8) (48.2) Net Debt to AMBudget 2018 - Key Fiscal Metrics (billions of dollars)Net Debt to GDP ratio. The government is committed to maintaining one of the lowest net debt to nominal GDP ratios among the provinces . Risk Adjustment. Alberta's revenue is extremely volatile and difficult to predict given the volatility of the price of oil . Budget 2018 continues to include a risk adjustment factor, ensuring a level of prudence in Alberta's budget and fiscal planning . The risk adjustment is $500 million in 2018-19 and increases to $700 million in 2019-20 and then to $1 billion in 2020-21 . pdf named: B18_FP_OVW_dtgr_cht.pdf Budget 2018 Overview Section Net Debt to GDP ratio Sources: RBC Canadian Federal and Provincial Fiscal Tables, February 28, 201815% 7%16%34%38%45% 40% 36% 34%47% /9:58 AMNet Debt to GDP 2017-18 Interprovincial Comparison Sources: RBC Canadian Federal and Provincial Fiscal Tables, February 28, 2018.Through the implementation of the cost constraints identified above, the deficit along the path to balance improves annually to arrive at a projected surplus of $0 .7 billion in 2023-24 . More detail is included in the Path to Balance chapter . 12 OVERVIEW FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21Albertans pay the lowest overall taxes in Canada.Revenue Alberta maintains the lowest overall tax regime in Canada, with no provincial sales tax, health premium or payroll tax . Albertans across all income ranges will continue to pay the lowest overall taxes when compared to other provinces . Alberta's tax advantage is $11 .2 billion in 2018-19 . In addition, in 2018-19, the government will maintain the Education Property Tax requisition at 2017-18 levels and Alberta's post-secondary students will benefit from a tuition freeze, for the fourth year . Total revenue is forecast to be $47 .9 billion in 2018-19, up 2 .1% from 2017-18 . Despite strong growth, revenue is not expected to exceed pre-recession levels until 2019-20 . Revenue growth will be led by income taxes, as stronger employment growth and higher household income will increase personal income taxes, while a robust manufacturing sector and an increase in bitumen production will boost corporate income taxes . This increase in bitumen production will also increase non-renewable resource revenue (NRR) . However, NRR in 2018-19 will still lag 2017-18 levels due to the US$7 .90 per barrel estimated increase in the light-heavy oil price differential due to pipelines reaching capacity towards the end of 2017 and rail transport not being able to fill the gap . Alberta's share of the cannabis tax revenue is reported in other taxes . The province, through this budget, has signalled that it will have the federal government collect Alberta's share of tax revenue from cannabis on our behalf . The Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission (AGLC) is responsible for administering the distribution of cannabis, including online sales, which will be reported in net income from government business enterprises . pdf named: B18_FP_OVW_B18rev_tb.pdf Budget 2018 Overview Revenue Section Budget 2018 Revenue (millions of dollars) 2016-17 2017-18 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 Actual Budget Forecast Taxes 20,181 /2:38 PMBudget 2018 - Revenue (millions of dollars) Expense As part of its plan to balance, government is committed to providing stable funding for core public services, including health care, education and social services . Government will target operating spending growth below population plus inflation, and avoid the province's history of volatile year-to-year swings in spending .13 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 20 OVERVIEW F Health. Budget 2018 provides $22 .1 billion for Health in 2018-19, keeping government's commitment to provide stable funding for health care . Health's 2018-19 budget reflects growth of 3% . This includes $87 million for addictions and mental health in 2018-19 . Mental health issues affect 20 per cent of Albertans and it is estimated that over 10 per cent of the population will require addiction treatment at some point in their lives . F Education. Budget 2018 provides $8 .4 billion for Education in 2018-19, keeping government's commitment to fund enrolment growth, projected at 2 .2% in 2018-19 . With $16 million in 2018-19, 30,000 students will receive a daily nutritious meal, up from 5,000 when the program was piloted in 2016-17 . F Advanced Education. Budget 2018 provides $6 .1 billion for Advanced Education in 2018-19, keeping government's commitment to provide stable, predictable funding for post-secondary education . Base operating grants for institutions will increase 2% per year, while accessibility and affordability for students improves with the fourth year of tuition freeze . F Community and Social Services. Budget 2018 provides $3 .7 billion for Community and Social Services in 2018-19, keeping government's commitment to strong families and strong communities . Budget 2018 includes additional investment in the Association of Alberta Sexual Assault Services to ensure survivors of sexual assault have the supports they need . F Children's Services. Budget 2018 provides $1 .5 billion for Children's Services in 2018-19, which includes keeping government's commitment to continue investing in improved outcomes for Alberta's children, including 78 new Early Learning and Child Care Centres, so that 4,500 additional children and their families will have access to affordable $25-per-day child care . After funding to maintain core public services, operating expense increases are below forecast growth in population and inflation at 3 .0% in 2018-19, 2 .7% in 2019-20 and 2 .5% in 2020-21 .

A more balanced oil market is expected to support prices . WTI is expected to average US$59/bbl in 2018-19, $60 in 2019-20 and $63 in 2020-21 . The Alberta economy is well on its way to recovering from one of the worst recessions of the last 40 years . Following impressive real GDP growth estimated at 4 .5% in 2017, the economy is forecast to expand by 2 .7% in 2018 . Rising economic activity led to a marked improvement in the labour market in 2017, with the Alberta economy recovering all of the jobs lost during the recession . This momentum is expected to carry into 2018, supporting employment growth of 2 .0% . Continued improvement in the labour market, especially in the high-paying goods sector, should bolster earnings growth . As a result, household incomes this year are expected to exceed 2014 levels . Population growth is forecast to pick up from 1 .4% in 2018 to 1 .6% by 2021 . The improving net inflows of interprovincial migrants will add to strong immigration and natural increase . Population growth is expected to be above the national average . Exports will drive growth in 2018, supported by rising oil sands production and an expanding manufacturing base . Beyond 2018, growth will be driven less by exports and more by households and businesses . After lagging the broader recovery in economic activity, non-residential investment starts to turn around beginning in 2019 when the economy shifts from recovery to expansion . This is expected to support real GDP growth of around 2 .5% in the medium term . Investment will be aided by Government of Alberta policies aimed at diversifying the energy sector . pdf named: B18_FP_OVW_eaea-tb.pdf Budget 2018 Overview Section Assumptions 2016-17 2017-18 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 Actual 2017b 2017f 2018f 2019f 2020f 2021f Real GDP (% change) (3.7) 2.6 4.5 2.7 2.5 2.4 2.6 Employment (% change) (1.6) 0.9 1.0 2.0 1.7 1.8 1.6 Unemployment Rate (%) 8.1 8.0 7.8 6.8 6.2 5.7 5.3 Primary Household Income (% change) (7.4) 1.8 4.4 4.5 4.7 4.8 4.9 Net Corporate Operating Surplus (% change) (46.3) 66.4 90.6 19.1 9.8 19.5 20.2 Alberta Consumer Price Index (% change) 1.1 1.9 1.6 2.1 1.9 2.0 2.0 Population (% change) 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.6 M:\\MinShare\\PublnsProd\\CorpFin\\OBM.PUBLNS-2018-19\\2018-19_BUDGET_FiscalPlan-vol\\1_Overview_B2018\\source-docs_Overview\\ B18_EnergyEconAssumpt_OCW-table.xlsx/Energy&EconAssumpt-tbl-OVW 3/14/2018/3:41 PMEnergy and Economic Assumptions15 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 20 OVERVIEW pdf named: B18_FP_OVW_5yCP_tb.pdf Budget 2018 Overview Section Capital Plan (billions of dollars) 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 5-year Estimate Target Target Projected Projected Total Capital Plan: Core Government 5.5 5.2 5.3 5.9 4.7 26.6 SUCH Sector - Self-financed Investment 0.9 0.7 0.7 0.5 0.5 3.3 Total Capital Plan 6.4 5.9 6.0 6.4 5.2 29.9 Capital Plan Financing: Direct Borrowing 3.8 3.7 4.3 4.9 3.8 20.5 Alternative Financing (P3s) 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.9 Other Cash Sources (e.g., retained income) 1.1 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 2.9 Climate Leadership Plan 0.6 0.7 0.4 0.3 0.4 2.4 SUCH Sector Self-financing 0.9 0.7 0.7 0.5 0.5 3.3 Total Capital Plan Financing 6.4 5.9 6.0 6.4 5.2 29.9 M:\\MinShare\\PublnsProd\\CorpFin\\OBM.PUBLNS 201819\\201819_BUDGET_FiscalPlan 2018 - Capital Plan (billions of dollars)Capital Plan The government chose to stimulate the economy during the downturn, through a nation-leading Capital Plan . This delivered on the recommendations from the former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge . The government took advantage of record low interest rates and cost pressures to make long-term investments and put Albertans back to work . As the economy recovers, and consistent with Dodge's recommendations, government is prudently returning to more normal levels of capital investment . With Alberta's economic recovery advancing and becoming more broad-based, the Budget 2018 Capital Plan strikes the balance between continuing to deliver on critical public infrastructure projects, while not competing for resources and crowding out investment in private sector infrastructure projects . The Budget 2018 Capital Plan is $30 billion over five years . This includes $26 .6 billion for the core government and $3 .3 billion for the SUCH sector . The Capital Plan provides: F $4 .6 billion over five years for health infrastructure including the new Edmonton hospital and Calgary Cancer Centre . F $2 .2 billion over five years for schools that support student learning and well-being and address community needs . F $2 .1 billion for climate change and environmental sustainability . This includes $83 million to make sure First Nations communities in Alberta have the infrastructure necessary to bring safe, clean, reliable drinking water to people . F $6 .9 billion over five years for municipalities, including $0 .9 billion for light rail transit . $3 billion is being committed over the next ten years for light rail transit in Edmonton and Calgary . F $3 .3 billion for roads and bridges to improve the flow of goods and services throughout the province and make roads safer for Albertans . F $5 .4 billion for capital maintenance and renewal to ensure public facilities continue to serve the needs of Albertans .16 OVERVIEW FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21Gender Budgeting The Government of Alberta is committed to advancing equality by allocating resources based on the needs of Alberta's diverse population to ensure that all government initiatives, programs, policies, and services are delivered effectively to every Albertan . Gender budgeting includes providing gender analysis in business planning and annual reporting processes, as well as in policies and programs funded by government . In 2015, government established its first stand-alone Ministry of the Status of Women, dedicated to spearheading the government's work to advance gender equality in Alberta . Status of Women is leading the initiative to integrate Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA+) across ministries to increase government's capacity to apply a gender and intersectional lens to policies, programs and legislation, including budget processes . The GBA+ tool helps ensure that government's work includes equity measures that address Albertans' diverse needs depending on where they live, their identities, lived experiences, and abilities, to support equal outcomes .

It avoids the province's history of volatile year-to-year swings in spending and focuses on investing tax dollars where they are needed most and targeting operating expense growth below growth in population and inflation . This is a responsible approach that continues to invest in vital public services including health care, education and social services . Government will continue to avoid the volatile year-to-year swings of the past and target operating expense growth of 3 .0% in 2018-19, 2 .7% in 2019-20 and 2 .5% in 2020-21 . Growth in population and inflation is expected to be 3 .5% in 2018-19, 3 .4% in 2019-20 and 3 .5% in 2020-21 .The low growth in total expense and operating expense also reflects actions government is taking to contain costs . Key actions include: managing public sector compensation through the negotiation of practical agreements with labour unions, a non-union wage freeze across the public sector and hiring restraint in the public service; implementation of strategies to manage health spending; normalizing the size of the capital plan; and a range of complementary actions to clean up waste, like reductions to discretionary spending and the review of Alberta's agencies, boards and commissions . 20 EXPENSE FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 211 Ministry expense, unless otherwise stated, includes as applicable, operating expense, capital grants, amortization, inventory consumption and loss on disposal of capital assets . Some ministries also have funds under Climate Leadership Plan, disaster assistance, debt servicing costs and pension provisions, which are not counted here .In 2016-17 and 2017-18, as Alberta recovered from a severe recession, population growth and inflation were lower than forecast at 2 .4% and 3 .0%, respectively . Operating expense grew 3 .1% in 2016-17 and is forecast to grow at 3 .8% in 2017-18, due to significant pressures on health, education and social services . The pressures resulted from high growth in specific populations such as school-aged children and Albertans with disabilities, and income support caseloads arising from the recession . Health The Ministry of Health provides a wide range of services that Alberta families rely on, including public health, community and home care, primary care, acute care and continuing and long-term care . Health's expense1 is budgeted at $22 .1 billion . Budget 2018 continues the government's ongoing commitment to provide stable funding for health care, with Health's operating expense budget increasing by 3% in 2018-19, a reflection of government's close management of health spending . In comparison, health spending grew by approximately 6% per year from 2008-09 to 2014-15 . From 2015-16 to 2017-18, spending was contained with growth of only 3 .3% a year . KEY INVESTMENTS Through government investments, hundreds of Continuing Care beds are expected to come on-line in 2018-19 to support the shift to community-based care . There is $248 million budgeted in 2018-19 to support Primary Health Care, and a consolidated total of $668 million for Population and Public Health throughout the ministry . There is $87 million budgeted for Addictions and Mental Health in 2018-19 . Mental health issues affect 20% of Albertans and it is estimated that over 10% of the population will require addiction treatment at some point in their lives .

Climate Leadership and Electricity CLIMATE LEADERSHIP PLAN With Budget 2018, government continues to implement the Climate Leadership Plan (CLP) . The CLP is a made-in-Alberta strategy to reduce carbon emissions while diversifying our economy, creating jobs and protecting our health and environment . Under the CLP , Alberta is phasing out emissions from coal-fired electricity generation and developing more renewable energy; has implemented an economy-wide carbon price on greenhouse gas emissions; is working with key stakeholders to implement a legislated limit on oil sands emissions; and is taking action to reduce methane gas emissions from the oil and gas sector by 45% by 2025 .35 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 EXPENSE pdf named: B18_FP_EXP_CLPaE_tb.pdf Budget 2018 Expense section Climate Leadership Plan Budget Details (millions of dollars) 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 3-Year Estimate Target Target Total Tax Rebates and Reductions Small Business Tax Rate Reduction 195 205 215 615 Capital Investment Tax Credit (Clean Tech Stream) 9 8 - 17 Sub-total 204 213 215 632 Targeted Programming Household and Other Rebates 536 518 506 1,560 Electricity Transition 214 228 237 680 Energy Efficiency 214 265 183 662 Indigenous Communities 49 49 46 145 Infrastructure and Transit 458 555 317 1,330 Innovation and Technology 183 192 146 521 Program Delivery and Other Initiatives 62 80 244 3/16/2018/4:29 PMClimate Leadership Plan Budget Details (millions of dollars)Climate Leadership Funding Over the next three years, $5 .3 billion will be spent to advance climate leadership initiatives including public transit, innovative research, energy efficiency programs, infrastructure projects, and support to Indigenous communities . A further $632 million will provide tax relief to businesses through the small business tax rate reduction and the Capital Investment Tax Credit - Clean Tech Stream . Household and Other Rebates. There is continued funding support for Albertans in the transition to a lower-carbon economy, including $1 .6 billion over three years in rebates to over 60% of Albertans to offset costs associated with the carbon levy . Electricity Transition. There is $680 million over three years for initiatives to support Alberta's transition away from coal-generated electricity including, coal transition payments, financial support for coal workers through the Coal Workforce T ransition Program, the Renewable Electricity Program and community generation . Finally, the province has capped electricity prices to protect families, farms, and small businesses for four years while the province implements the necessary reforms to the electricity system . Energy Efficiency. There is $662 million over three years to support energy efficiency projects . Programs are in place for the residential, commercial, non-profit, agricultural and municipal sectors . Programs are also in place to help the commercial and industrial sectors lower emissions and energy use and reduce costs . Programming is being delivered by Energy Efficiency Alberta, Emissions Reduction Alberta and several Government of Alberta ministries . Indigenous Communities. There is $145 million over three years for the Indigenous Climate Leadership Initiative to support retrofits of buildings, solar panel installations, energy audits, and capacity building and employment programs in Indigenous communities .Budget 2018 provides tax relief to businesses.36 EXPENSE FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 Electricity Transition Alberta Energy is leading the work to transition the electricity system which includes a number of initiatives, some of which are under the Climate Leadership Plan, and others which are outside the Climate Leadership Plan. In November 2016, the government announced agreements with TransAlta, Capital Power and ATCO to end coal-fired emissions through the provision of transition payments for the six coal-fired units. These agreements will encourage the affected companies to participate in Alberta's transition from coal to lower-emitting sources of electricity, such as natural gas and renewables, and are key to helping Alberta meet its target of 30 per cent renewable electricity by 2030. On November 30, 2016, the government announced the Renewable Electricity Program (REP) to encourage growth of renewable energy such as wind, solar, geothermal, sustainable biomass and hydro. The REP is designed to attract new investment to Alberta in large-scale renewables, create jobs and diversify Alberta's economy. It is estimated that the REP will attract new private investment approaching $10 billion and create at least 7,200 jobs. The highly competitive first round of REP saw strong investor confidence and attracted private investment from Alberta and around the world, successful bidders providing 600 megawatts of renewable electricity to the grid by the end of 2019 at a record-low price for renewable energy in Canada. The province recently announced its intention to open the second and third rounds of competition. Government is working to make it easier for Albertans, businesses and communities to offset their electricity consumption with renewable energy. The Micro-generation Regulation continues to enable distributed alternative and renewable generation intended for load displacement in individual households and small businesses. Community generation is the next step in the growth of locally generated power and will make it easier for Albertans, businesses and communities to produce and use renewable electricity. The province's electricity system will transition from an energy-only market to a capacity market framework in 2021. A capacity market will ensure that investment in new generation is sufficient to provide reliable electricity supply at stable, affordable prices. The introduction of a capacity market will provide more predictable prices for both consumers and investors, protecting Albertans from the volatility and price spikes we have endured under the energy-only market since deregulation. The capacity market will be fully operational and protecting Albertans from price swings in 2021. Until that time, the government has implemented a cap for the Regulated Rate Option (RRO) . The price cap ensures that Albertans, small businesses and farms eligible for the RRO will pay no more than 6.8 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity over four years, until May 2021. The Balancing Pool continues to manage the cost to consumers resulting from the return of the Power Purchase Agreements by power companies. Costs are recovered over time reducing the impact on consumers' monthly electricity bills .37 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 EXPENSE Infrastructure and Transit. There is $1 .3 billion in funding for a variety of programs to enable greater public use of transit, including development of low-carbon transit fleets and expanded light rail transit systems in Calgary and Edmonton . Funding will also support the construction and retrofits of government buildings to higher standards to improve energy efficiency, and to help Alberta adapt to climate change . Innovation and Technology. There is $521 million over three years to support innovation and technology development . Broader climate programming is being delivered through the Climate Change Innovation and Technology Framework being delivered by Alberta Economic Development and T rade, with additional industrial supports being delivered by Emissions Reduction Alberta, Energy Efficiency Alberta and the Alberta Climate Change Office . Program Delivery and Other Initiatives. There is $386 million over three years for future programming or an expansion of existing programs and initiatives, as well as funding for delivery of programming across government . Emissions Impacts Alberta's CLP policies, legislation and programs all drive towards reduced greenhouse gas emissions and changing Alberta's emissions path . The impacts of CLP policies and programs on emissions are expected as early as 2017 with reductions forecasted to continue with decreases in emissions from the electricity sector, and oil and gas sector's methane emissions . These emissions reductions are expected to be complemented by large industrial facilities' investment decisions in response to the incentive structure created by the full implementation of the carbon level and carbon competitiveness incentives . Further reductions from building improvements in the residential, commercial and institutional sector and in transportation are expected to occur as a result of the carbon levy and program incentives . GHG emissions can potentially be further reduced through the impact of clean technology investments . Gender Budgeting Advancing gender equality is a critical priority for the Government of Alberta, and is reflected in Budget 2018 . Opportunities to impact change and improve lives for women and girls are supported through Alberta Status of Women, including a Community Grant Program . Budget 2018 provides a minimum of $500,000 annually to charitable and non-profit organizations in Alberta for projects and activities related to enhancing women's economic security, increasing women in leadership and democratic participation, and preventing and responding to gender-based violence . PROMOTING EQUALITY THROUGH ECONOMIC SECURITY Having access to quality and affordable child care, reducing other barriers to employment, and ensuring minimum wage is a living wage are crucial to the growth of Alberta's economy . Women's full participation in the economy supports economic diversification and creates jobs and opportunities that benefit all Albertans . Several initiatives are underway to promote economic Budget 2018 supports women's economic security38 EXPENSE FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21security for women, Indigenous peoples, those with low incomes, and persons with disabilities . The Early Learning and Child Care Centre program will create an additional 4,500 affordable child care spaces and has positive benefits for working parents and for those working in child care settings, who are predominately women . The Alberta Child Benefit (ACB) makes life more affordable for Albertans by providing direct financial assistance to lower-income families . The Alberta Family Employment Tax Credit (AFETC) helps lower- and middle-income working families support their children, especially single parents who are predominantly women . Approximately $328 million in ACB and AFETC benefits are provided in Budget 2018 . In October 2018, minimum wage will increase to $15/hour . Women account for more than 60% of minimum wage earners and are disproportionately represented in low-paying careers, even though Alberta women tend to be highly educated . Recognizing that groups require different supports based on their identities and backgrounds, Budget 2018 provides $70,000 for the First Nations Women's Councils on Economic Security and the M\u00e9tis Women's Council on Economic Security . These councils work to improve the lives of Indigenous women and their communities . Government is working collaboratively with industry to advance diversity and inclusion through a range of its economic development and diversification initiatives . The Alberta Investor and Interactive Digital Media Tax Credits and the Petrochemical Diversification and Partial Upgrading Commercialization Programs all include evaluation criteria that create a preference for proponents who meet specific diversity and inclusion criteria . PROMOTING EQUALITY THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION Gender balance in decision-making bodies, whether elected or appointed, is necessary to ensure organizations fully reflect the diversity of Albertans and to increase and encourage innovative decision-making . Government launched the public agencies, boards, and commissions online recruitment site to help raise women's representation from 32% in March 2015, to 53% as of January 2018 . The total percentage of corporate board seats occupied by women increased from 12% in 2016 to 14% in 2017, according to the Alberta Securities Commission . PREVENTING AND RESPONDING TO GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE Sexual violence is a violation of the fundamental human right to safety and bodily autonomy and is a barrier to full participation for survivors in their communities . Building on annual funding of $4 million a year provided to assist 12 sexual assault centres and their provincial organization -the Association of Alberta Sexual Assault Services-an additional $8 million was provided in March 2018 and Budget 2018 also includes $11 million in additional funding . Alberta's women's shelters provide accommodation for women and children in crisis from family violence, and help them rebuild their lives . Since 2015-16, $28 million in Family and Community Safety Program grant funding has been allocated to support 119 community projects focused 39 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 EXPENSE on family violence, sexual violence, child sexual abuse and healthy relationships . The projects target diverse populations, including First Nations, M\u00e9tis, immigrant and refugee communities, and LGBTQ and rural populations . In August 2016, the Government of Alberta announced new protections under the Residential T enancies Act and the Termination of Tenancy (Domestic Violence) Regulation, which allow tenants experiencing domestic violence to break their leases without penalty . Between August 8, 2016 and February 28, 2018, 406 Safer Spaces certificates have been issued . These protections for victims of domestic violence reduce financial barriers to leaving unsafe home environments . An Act to Remove Barriers for Survivors of Sexual and Domestic Violence came into effect on May 4, 2017, which eliminated limitation periods for launching a civil claim related to sexual or domestic violence . By removing limitation periods, the Government of Alberta is making the legal system more accessible to victims of sexual and domestic violence, recognizing that it can take survivors longer than two years to come forward with a claim . ASSISTING FAMILIES OF MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN As part of the commitment to the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, the government supported the establishment of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and passed an Order in Council granting the same Commissioners with the authority to examine areas of provincial jurisdiction, such as child welfare, justice, and health . Alberta also established a Family Information Liaison Unit . The unit is intended to be a single point of contact where experienced front-line staff can provide families with information about the justice system and legal processes, as well as specific updates about criminal investigations, court proceedings or fatality inquiries involving their loved ones . The team can also link families with Elders, spiritual support and counselling .Alberta has established a Family Information Liaison Unit.40 EXPENSE FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21pdf named: B18_FP_EXP_B18-psc-tb.pdf Budget 2018 Expense 625 633 640 641 Environmental Protection and Enhancement Fund 35 10 32 10 10 11 Sub-total 20,812 21,135 / B18.Public Sector Comp 3/15/2018 / 8:18 PMBudget 2018 - Public Sector Compensation (millions of dollars)Cost Containment Government's prudent management of the province's finances involves investing dollars in the most critical services while containing costs . Government's plan achieves cost containment by focusing on the two largest areas of provincial government spending: public sector compensation and health care . Government is also taking steps to clean up waste . PUBLIC SECTOR COMPENSATION Total public sector compensation, including teachers, doctors and nurses, is budgeted at $26 .6 billion in 2018-19 . It includes the cost of existing collective agreements . Total public sector compensation makes up more than half of government's annual operating expense . Given the scale of public sector compensation, managing this aspect of operating expense is critical to achieving cost containment and returning to balance . Key actions include: F Negotiating fair and practical agreements with public sector unions . Successful agreements with responsible partners such as the Alberta Teachers' Association and United Nurses of Alberta have restrained salary growth in a challenging fiscal environment . These partnerships have allowed government to invest in better work environments and ensure the stability of critical services to the benefit of all Albertans . F Extending the salary freeze on non-union employees across the public sector to September 2019 . The salary freeze has saved $29 million a year since it was introduced in the Alberta Public Service (APS) . F A hiring restraint in the APS was strengthened in December 2017, with the objective of keeping the size of the APS flat . This has resulted in cumulative savings of $204 million . Actions to contain compensation growth are evident in the declining share of total public sector compensation as a proportion of operating expense . It makes up 54 .6% of operating expense in 2018-19, and is forecast to fall slightly to 54 .1% of operating expense by 2020-21 .41 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 EXPENSE HEALTH Government has made significant progress containing health costs . Health spending grew approximately 6 .0% a year from 2008-09 to 2014-15 . From 2015-16 to 2017-18, spending was contained with growth of only 3 .3% a year . Over the next three years health spending growth is budgeted at 3 .0% a year . As identified in the Health section, a number of strategies are being used to contain costs, including: F Savings of more than $100 million over the last three years through reduced generic drug prices . F A new funding framework with the Alberta Pharmacists' Association that will save $150 million over the next two years and slow spending growth in government-sponsored drug programs . F Operational Best Practice (OBP), which is an Alberta Health Services (AHS) initiative that benchmarks AHS with comparable organizations to achieve efficiencies while still delivering safe, quality health care to Albertans . OBP initiatives have resulted in cost avoidance of $28 million in 2017-18 . FINDING EFFICIENCIES Continuous improvement is focused on ongoing efforts to achieve the greatest efficiencies and effectiveness across government through transformation and innovation . Key areas include: F Consolidating and modernizing corporate services such as communications, information technologies, finance and human resources, so they are more effective and deliver high levels of service that ultimately support Albertans . Opportunities to contract-in services will also be considered where efficiencies can be achieved . Once complete, annual savings from corporate service improvements are expected to be tens of millions of dollars . F Looking for opportunities to reallocate Alberta Public Service staff to essential services and priority areas . CLEANING UP WASTE F Tightly controlling discretionary spending across government with restrictions on travel, conferences, advertising, publications and hospitality . Discretionary spending has declined 14% from 2014-15 to 2016-17 . Discretionary spending for travel and hospitality in the Alberta Public Service declined by 25% and 23% respectively in that same time period . To limit discretionary spending, opportunities to leverage technology are being used such as video conferencing in lieu of travel . F The review of agencies, boards and commissions has led to the amalgamation or dissolution of 66 agencies, boards and commissions . F Government has cut the salaries of the highest paid executives in agencies, boards and commissions and eliminated perks and bonuses such as tax-payer funded golf club memberships . These actions will save $16 million a year .42 BLANK PAGE43Fiscal Plan Revenue44 REVENUE FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 Table of Contents REVENUE Revenue - 21 REVENUERevenue Revenue Outlook Total revenue is forecast to be $47 .9 billion in 2018-19, $1 billion, or 2 .1% higher than the 2017-18 forecast . While this is still below the $49 .5 billion prior to the oil price collapse in 2014, revenue is expected to continue strengthening, surpassing $50 billion in 2019-20 and reaching $53 .8 billion by 2020-21, with growth averaging 6 .1% over these two years . After the 2014 oil price drop, prices remained low, causing Alberta's economy to contract in both 2015 and 2016, by 3 .6%, and an estimated 3 .7%, respectively . Employment losses and wage restraint led to decreased household income, hampered consumer activity and reduced personal income tax revenue . Corporate profits tumbled resulting in lower corporate income tax revenue and significant efforts to reduce costs . Business investment deteriorated . The impact on government royalty revenue was most severe, with resource revenue dropping over $6 billion in fiscal year 2015-16, while total revenue declined by $7 billion . While most revenue improved in 2016-17, and investment income was the highest ever recorded, resource revenue and income taxes, which typically make up about half of overall revenue, are taking longer to recover . Alberta's economy rebounded in 2017, expanding by an estimated 4 .5%, led by conventional investment, consumer spending, manufacturing and exports . The revenue forecast for 2017-18 has been increased from budget, primarily due to higher investment income, conventional oil and natural gas royalties, and land lease sales, and a sizeable reversal in the Balancing Pool liability . The higher royalties are mainly due to lower producer costs and higher condensate royalties . The Budget 2018 revenue forecast is based on gradually increasing oil prices, a continued ramp-up in oil sands production, and economic expansion . Income tax revenue is expected to recover from the lingering remnants of the two-year recession, boosted by healthy employment, household income and consumer spending growth, reduced business costs, and increasing exports and housing Total revenue fell $7 billion in 2015-16 relative to 2014-15.

Revenue forecast based on gradually increasing oil prices and oil sands production, and employment and household income growth.46 REVENUE FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 Prices of Oil and Natural Gas Pdf name: B18-FP_REV_chrt02.pdf Budget 2018 Revenue section Oil and Natural construction . Climate Leadership Plan (CLP) revenue also increases, mainly from the federally-imposed carbon price jump effective January 1, 2021, to $40 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent . Resource revenue remains weak in 2018-19, $0 .7 billion lower than the forecast for 2017-18, with only a modest rise in oil prices . The positive impact on revenue from the price lift is more than offset by the negative impact of the higher exchange rate and wider light-heavy oil price differential, the latter due to insufficient pipeline and other transportation capacity for Alberta oil to reach markets . Bitumen royalties begin increasing in 2019-20, with oil prices rising and production growth . Revenue received by industry and government still suffers from a deep price discount, as higher rail costs set prices without enough pipeline capacity . In 2020-21, when new and expanded pipelines are expected to come on-stream, bitumen royalties jump 34% . Total revenue increases by almost $7 billion between the 2017-18 forecast and 2020-21, with the largest increase from income taxes ($3 .6 billion) . Most of the rest of the growth in revenue is from bitumen royalties, CLP revenue, federal transfers and investment income . The government is committed to diversifying the economy and leaving no Albertan behind . Revenue initiatives supporting these goals include: freezing post-secondary tuition for the fourth year; extending and adding funding for the two tax credits introduced in Budget 2016 (one for investment in eligible small and medium-sized business, and the other for capital spending in eligible industries supporting diversification); introducing a second phase of the Petrochemicals Diversification Program; and keeping 2018-19 education property tax revenue at the 2017-18 level .Revenue increases $7 billion between 2017-18 and 2020-21, led by income taxes.47 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 REVENUENon-Renewable Resource Revenue Non-renewable resource revenue in 2018-19 accounts for 8% of total revenue, and its share is expected to grow to 9 .3% by 2020-21 . This is still well below the 18% share of total revenue in 2014-15, or 27% in 2011-12 . It is forecast at $3 .8 billion in 2018-19, $0 .7 billion lower than in 2017-18 . The decrease is primarily from lower bitumen royalties, due mainly to a widening of the light-heavy oil price differential and a higher exchange rate forecast . Revenue is estimated to increase to $5 billion in 2020-21, driven by accelerating bitumen royalties from improving oil prices, rising production and lower costs, in spite of the differential remaining wide . The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price averaged almost US$93 per barrel (/bbl) in the four fiscal years 2010-11 to 2013-14, but then fell 70%, from US$105/bbl in June 2014 to approximately US$30 in February 2016 . The price collapse arose from global supply growth exceeding demand growth, with supply boosted by significant increases, including from North American production, and demand muted by a slowdown in developing economies . Prices began to strengthen in 2016, climbing into the mid-US$40/bbl range, due mainly to supply disruptions, declining US crude output and stronger-than-anticipated global demand growth . In late 2016, OPEC members and several non-OPEC producers agreed to reduce output by 1 .8 million barrels per day, starting in 2017 . Average monthly prices approached US$50/bbl by December 2016, and climbed to almost $52 for the first three months of 2017, supported by the agreement and solid global demand growth . The elevated prices fueled increased US production and raised concerns about the pace of global demand-supply rebalancing, as inventories remained high . This decreased prices to about US$48/bbl in mid-2017 . The OPEC / non- OPEC agreement was then extended until the end of 2018 . This, together with continued demand growth, OPEC compliance, supply disruptions from pipeline outages and geopolitical events, as well as reduced global inventories, contributed to boost oil prices to US$55 in the fall of 2017 . Prices rose to US$63 .50 in January 2018, though they have fallen slightly since then . Most analysts are forecasting that prices will be supported by the OPEC-led supply compliance, but that price growth will be limited by expanded US shale production that higher prices encourage . Continued global demand growth over the medium term is expected to exceed potential US supply growth, requiring incremental output from higher-cost producers, and thus gradually rising oil prices . The current view is that prices will reach US$70 by 2023 . The Budget 2018 forecast is based on WTI oil prices averaging US$59/bbl in 2018-19, US$60 in 2019-20 and US$63 in 2020-21 . Other factors affecting oil royalties are the light-heavy price differential, the US-Canadian dollar exchange rate, production, oil sands project status and producer costs: The Western Canadian Select price (WCS), a benchmark price for heavy oil (blended bitumen), is determined by the WTI US dollar price less a \"light-heavy differential . \" The differential is linked to costs of transporting Alberta production to Gulf Coast refineries or coastal ports for export, and to the lower quality of heavy oil relative to light sweet crude . Sufficient pipeline capacity lowers costs and the differential, increasing prices for Alberta Resource revenue in 2018-19 is estimated at $3.8 billion. Oil prices declined dramatically from excess supply relative to demand growth. Oil price now not expected to reach US$70 per barrel until 2023. Revenue forecast based on US$59 oil price in 2018-19, and US$63 by 2020-21.48 REVENUE FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 producers; moving product by rail increases costs and the differential, lowering WCS prices . With Alberta production ramping up, pipeline access has become insufficient . In addition, any pipeline outages exacerbate the situation . This occurred in late 2017, raising the differential over US$25/bbl, where it still sits . The differential is estimated to have averaged US$14 .50 in 2017-18, but is forecast to average US$22 .35/bbl in 2018-19 . The Enbridge Line 3 replacement pipeline is anticipated to start operations by 2019, while the T ransCanada Keystone XL and Kinder Morgan T ransMountain Expansion pipelines are expected by 2021 . A lower US-Canadian dollar exchange rate supports royalty revenue . The bitumen royalty rate is based on the WTI price expressed in Canadian dollars, so the rate is higher with a lower Canadian dollar . A lower dollar also increases oil prices when they are converted from US into Canadian dollars, elevating producers' revenue in Canadian dollars . The exchange rate forecast has increased to 80 US\u00a2/Cdn$ for the forecast period . Bitumen production continues to grow . It is estimated to increase 21 .3% between 2017-18 and 2020-21 as projects completed in 2017-18 ramp up and other expansions finish . Conventional crude production remains flat . Oil sands royalties change when projects reach post-payout status (total project revenue exceeds total capital and operating costs) . Prior to payout, royalties are 1-9% of gross revenue, while after payout, they are the greater of 1-9% of gross revenue or 25- 40% of net revenue . With recent lower prices and higher costs from rail transportation, some post-payout projects would be paying the lower rate on gross revenue, while other projects would be delayed in reaching payout . Several years of low oil prices have incented industry to seek efficiencies, improve productivity and reduce costs . Prices for condensate used to dilute bitumen for transportation have also declined, as condensate prices follow oil prices . Natural gas is a significant input for oil sands operations and gas prices are forecast to remain weak . Since costs are part of royalty calculations, these support royalty revenue . Bitumen royalties are estimated at $1 .8 billion in 2018-19, $573 million lower than in 2017-18, due primarily to the wider light-heavy oil price differential and higher exchange rate . The US$5 increase to WTI is more than offset by the differential discount . Royalties are forecast to increase to $2 .9 billion by 2020-21 . The main drivers are increasing oil prices, higher production and lower project costs . The government will supply bitumen to the North West Redwater Sturgeon Refinery, tentatively scheduled to begin commercial operations June 1, 2018 . The refinery will upgrade bitumen into higher-valued products such as ultra-low sulphur diesel . The Province will receive a portion of the revenue from the sale of the upgraded product, but is also responsible to pay monthly cost of service tolls for the 30-year term of the contract . Conventional oil royalties are estimated at $1 .1 billion in 2018-19, $170 million higher than 2017-18, and at $1 billion by 2020-21 . Revenue in 2017-18 increased significantly from budget, mainly due to lower costs and higher condensate royalties . Condensate is used to dilute bitumen for transportation for Alberta production incresases value to Albertans. Bitumen production to grow 21% over next three years. Bitumen royalties estimated at $1.8 billion in 2018-19; increase to $2.9 billion by 2020-21.49 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 REVENUEPdf name: B18-FP_REV_tb05_oa.pdf Budget 2018 Revenue section Oil Assumptions 201617 201819 2019-20 2020-21 Actual Budget Forecast Estimate Target Bitumen royalty 1,483 2,546 2,358 1,785 2,184 716 and its price follows the WTI price . With greater demand expected from oil sands output growth, production has been increasing . This is also a major reason for the higher-than-expected land lease sales in 2017-18, targeted at areas rich in liquids, including condensates . Natural gas and by-product royalties are estimated at $541 million in 2018-19, on par with 2017-18 revenue, which was higher than budget due primarily to lower costs, higher production and revenue from by-products, even with lower natural gas prices . Since prices for natural gas by-products, such as propane, butane and pentanes plus, follow oil prices, the recent slight uplift in oil prices spurred increased production to maximize higher-valued natural gas liquids extraction . Royalties are forecast at $585 million by 2020-21, with prices increasing and costs constrained . The immediate outlook for natural gas prices continues to be mixed, with abundant natural gas supplies keeping prices low . US natural gas production is expected to more than keep pace with demand growth arising from US natural gas exports, industrial demand and retirement of coal-fired electricity plants over the medium term . However, Alberta natural gas prices are buoyed by increasing demand from expanding oil sands operations, petrochemical and electricity-generation developments . A second phase of the Petrochemicals Diversification Program will provide another $500 million in royalty credits for investment in facilities to upgrade methane and propane to higher-value products such as propylene and polypropylene . This follows the success of the first phase under which two facilities, estimated to cost between $5 and $6 billion, and create 4,000 construction and 200 operational jobs, were approved . The royalty credits are provided following expected project completion beginning in 2020-21, with royalties forecast to be reduced $81 million that year, with remaining credits of $919 million estimated to be claimed over the following four years .Condensate production has been rising and boosts conventional royalties. Second phase of Petrochemicals Diversification Program introduced, following phase one success and demand.

This is $1 .7 billion, or 8%, higher than 2017-18, as personal and corporate income taxes strengthen coming out of the recession, and the Climate Leadership Plan carbon levy increases primarily as the carbon price moves from $20 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent to $30, effective January 1, 2018 . Tax revenue grows to $26 billion by 2020-21, with about 80% of the increase from income tax revenue . Personal income tax revenue is estimated at $11 .4 billion in 2018-19, an increase of $532 million, or 4 .9% from 2017-18 . The 2017-18 forecast was decreased by $322 million from Budget 2017 after 2016 assessment data, not received until late summer 2017, proved to be much lower than expected . This indicated the drag on personal incomes from the recession was deeper than expected when Budget 2017 was prepared . The reduction to 2016 assessment data lowers the base used to forecast personal income tax revenue for 2017 and future years . However, with better employment and household income growth for 2017 and forward, personal income tax revenue is forecast to increase by an average of 5 .3% per year between 2018-19 and 2020-21, to $12 .6 billion . Corporate income tax is forecast at $4 .6 billion in 2018-19, $699 million or 18 .1% higher than 2017-18 . Corporate profits (net corporate operating surplus) fell by 64% in 2015 and by 46% in 2016, before reviving in 2017 with an estimated 91% growth, driven by solid exports, manufacturing and consumer spending . Corporate income tax revenue in 2017-18 was reduced though mainly due to larger-than-estimated refunds claimed in 2017 by corporations as they carried losses back against income taxes paid in 2013 and 2014 . With corporate loss carry-backs depleting, refunds are expected to return to historical levels in the next two years, which boosts revenue . With ongoing positive corporate profits forecast, based on rising economic activity, improving oil prices, and cost containment, corporate income tax increases $1 .2 billion between 2018-19 and 2020-21, an average of 12 .1% per year, to $5 .7 billion . This is still slightly below the level it was in 2014-15 .T ax revenue of $22.9 billion in 2018-19 is about half of total revenue. Personal income tax revenue is $11.4 billion in 2018-19, and $12.6 billion by 2020-21.51 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 REVENUEThe Alberta investor and capital investment tax credits were introduced in Budget 2016, the first for investment in eligible small and medium-sized non-traditional sector businesses, and the second for spending on capital in eligible industries, with $165 million budgeted over two years . The credits are being extended to 2021-22, with an additional $185 million in funding . Of the total $350 million, $133 million is reported as expense, while $217 million is reported as a reduction to corporate income tax . Education property tax revenue is forecast at $2 .4 billion in 2018-19, the same as 2017-18 . Instead of increasing the requisition based on the policy of 32% of total education system operating expense, the government has chosen to freeze revenue, saving property taxpayers $114 million . With lower assessment values resulting from the two-year recession, mill rates are increasing slightly, but only to raise the same revenue . The residential/farm rate is $2 .56 per $1,000 of equalized assessment, and the non-residential rate is $3 .76 per $1,000 of equalized assessment . Other tax revenue is forecast at $4 .5 billion in 2018-19, an increase of $458 million from 2017-18 . The carbon levy is $344 million higher, mainly as the carbon price moved to $30 per tonne effective January 1, 2018 . Other tax revenue is anticipated to grow another $416 million to $4 .9 billion, an average of 4 .5% per year between 2018-19 and 2020-21 . The carbon levy increases by $146 million in 2020-21, mainly due to the federally-imposed increase in the carbon price, to $40 per tonne on January 1, 2021 . Other taxes also reflect Alberta's estimated share of the cannabis tax room agreed to by the federal and provincial governments, beginning with $26 million in 2018-19, and rising to $99 million by 2020-21 .Alberta investor and capital investment tax credits extended, with more funding budgeted. Education property tax revenue for 2018-19 frozen at 2017-18 level.

This is an increase of $300 million or 3 .8% from 2017-18, even though 2017-18 included an additional in-year bump of $82 million in AgriStability agriculture support related to prior-year program claims . The Canada Social T ransfer (CST) and Canada Health T ransfer (CHT) grow in line with federal annual escalators and changes to Alberta's share of the national population . For CST, the escalator is 3%, while for CHT, it is based on the higher of the three-year average of national nominal GDP growth, or 3% . For 2018-19, the CHT escalator is estimated at 4% . Federal transfers of $8.2 billion in 2018-19 are about 17% of government revenue.52 REVENUE FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 Pdf name: B18-FP_REV_tb11_tfgoc.pdf Budget 2018 Revenue section Transfers from Government of Canada (millions of dollars) 201617 201819 2019-20 2020-21 Actual Budget Forecast Estimate Transfer 4,201 4,360 4,325 1,713 1,772 Transfers to SUCH sector 528 479 478 520 530 537 Agriculture support programs 386 293 376 308 309 312 Infrastructure support 337 741 528 510 395 276 Labour market agreements 223 203 232 250 267 290 Other transfers 747 298 379 452 509 500 (millions of dollars)The forecast includes funding for a number of new or expanded programs: the renewed, enhanced labour market agreements, which increased by $29 million during 2017-18, and grow about $20 million per year for the next three years; the new Early Learning and Child Care Agreement introduced during 2017-18 which provides $46 million per year; the ten-year home care and mental health care agreement from last year, with $35 million in 2017-18, $100 million in 2018-19, and $148 million by 2020-21; the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund, built into Alberta's Climate Leadership Plan, provides $29 million in 2018-19, $75 million in 2019-20, and $35 million in 2020-21 . Federal support for infrastructure was increased with the introduction of two programs for public transit and clean water and wastewater projects several years ago . Of the funding budgeted in 2017-18, $213 million has been re- profiled into 2018-19 and 2019-20, when the programs end . Federal transfers are forecast to grow by an average of 2 .6% between 2018-19 and 2020-21, reaching $8 .6 billion, with expected increases in CHT, CST and other transfers enhanced by the new programs noted above, partly offset by the ending of the two time-sensitive infrastructure programs .Forecast includes new targeted funding for home care, mental health care, early learning and child care, labour market programs and climate initiatives. Investment Income Investment income is forecast at $2 .9 billion in 2018-19, a $177 million or 6% decrease from 2017-18, mainly due to lower Heritage and endowment fund income, as financial markets reset after several years of strong returns which enabled significant gains to be realized from asset sales . The forecast typically assumes market returns will trend back to \"normal\" rates, so income tends to decrease in years after above-average returns . Over the last five years (2013-14 to 2017-18), investment income has averaged $3 .1 billion . Investment income is estimated to increase by an average of 7 .9% per year between 2018-19 and 2020-21, reaching $3 .4 billion . This is primarily from higher Alberta Capital Finance Authority (ACFA) income, and to including income from the new $5 billion reserve established to manage cash flow risk . Both of these are offset by related increased debt servicing costs . Investment income from ACFA is forecast to increase by $127 million or 58% in 2018-19, and by an average of 12 .5% per year to 2020-21 . ACFA accesses the government's strong credit rating to borrow and then transfers that advantage to municipalities and other local authorities by on-lending the Investment income has averaged $3.1 billion over the last five years.53 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 REVENUEPdf name: B18-FP_Rev_tb12_faii.pdf Budget 2018 Revenue section Fund Assets/Investment Income (millions of dollars) Assets as at 2016 17 2018 19 2019-20 2020-21 Mar. 31, 2017 Actual Forecast Estimate Target Target Savings Trust Fund 15,352 2,467 1,972 1,653 1,759 1,838 Endowment Funds a3,847 526 416 336 405 436 Alberta Capital Finance Authority 15,797 185 218 345 394 437 Agriculture Financial Services Corp. 5,107 130 125 135 145 157 SUCH sector n.a. 312 258 254 256 258 Cash reserve ($5 b.: Mar. 31, 2018) - - - 80 110 125 Other b2,936 78 72 81 92 106 Total 43,039 3,698 3,061 2,884 3,161 3,357 a Includes Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research End owment Fund, Alberta Heritage Scholarship Fund and Alberta Heritage Science and Engi neering Research Fund b Assets include Contingency Account, Cancer Prevention Legacy Fund and Alberta Enterprise Corporation; investment income includes income from these sources, student loans and a variety of smaller funds and accounts201718 M:\\MinShare\\PublnsProd\\CorpFin\\OBM.PUBLNS-2018-19\\2018-19_BUDGE T_FiscalPlan-vol\\3_REVenue_B2018\\source-docs\\ B-18_FP_REVenue_tables.xlsx3/13/2018 6:51 PMa Includes Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research Endowment Fund, Alberta Heritage Scholarship Fund and Alberta Heritage Science and Engineering Research Fund. b Assets include Contingency Account, Cancer Prevention Legacy Fund and Alberta Enterprise Corporation; investment income includes income from these sources, student loans and other investment income from a variety of smaller funds and accounts.Fund Assets / Investment Income (millions of dollars)proceeds . The large increases result from greater use of complex financial instruments, such as swaps, to mitigate risk associated with managing the debt portfolio incurred, and the portfolio of loans provided to local authorities, including cash flow timing differences for repayments . The increased use arises as a significant amount of \"fixed rate\" debt has matured recently, and is being replaced with \"floating rate\" debt to enable this risk management . There is a related offsetting increase in debt servicing costs . The Agriculture Financial Services Corporation (AFSC) similarly borrows at the government's rate and lends the proceeds to Alberta's agriculture sector . Again, associated debt servicing costs are offset by income from loans . AFSC is also an insurer, and has additional funds and investment income from this activity . ACFA and AFSC provide government borrowing rate benefits to municipalities and farmers. Other Revenue Other revenue is forecast at $10 billion in 2018-19, about 21% of total revenue . This is a decrease of $107 million from 2017-18, which included a positive change in the Balancing Pool net liability . The Pool was consolidated in government reporting at year-end 2016-17, when an initial $2 billion liability was reported as negative revenue . The liability was lowered by $771 million, which is reported as positive revenue in 2017-18 . As the Pool legally ends in 2030, it will need to generate net income totalling $1 .2 billion over 13 years to eliminate its liability . Regulation of cannabis, and responsibility for on-line retail sales, has been assigned to the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission . Net income from these activities includes retailer fees and sales revenue, less costs for administration and purchasing inventory . In 2018-19 and 2019-20, net income is estimated at negative $43 million and $47 million respectively, as set-up and product acquisition costs exceed revenue, but after that, income turns positive, with $37 million forecast for 2020-21 . Compliance payments from large emitters into the Climate Change and Emissions Management Fund in 2018-19 are estimated to increase $331 million, as 2018 is the first year of the Carbon Competitiveness Incentive Regulation . 54 REVENUE FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 Pdf name: B18-FP_Rev_tb13_rfos.pdf Budget 2018 Revenue section Revenue from Other Sources (millions of dollars) 2016-17 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 Actual Budget Forecast Estimate Target Target / lottery 1,430 1,445 1,384 867 794 784 859 Alberta Treasury Branches 151 93 212 242 281 331 Balancing Pool (1,952) - 771 161 86 1,223 1,237 1,260 1,288 Health / school board fees 704 655 655 664 668 672 Other premiums, fees and licences 1,828 1,805 1,864 1,040 1,068 1,089 SUCH fundraising, donations, gifts 708 627 631 639 667 684 Climate Ch. and Emiss.

Fund 163 Sources (millions of dollars)Whereas the previous regulation measured facility emission performance relative to its own historic baseline, the new regulation rewards low-emission performance and incents innovation by setting numerous product emissions benchmarks . The increase in 2020-21 is mainly from the full phase-in of the new product benchmarks in 2020, and the federal carbon price increase to $40 per tonne January 1, 2021 . Other revenue is estimated to grow by $800 million, or an average of 3 .9% per year, between 2018-19 and 2020-21, reaching $10 .9 billion . In addition to the increases above, this reflects the forecast for moderate Alberta economic growth, with wages, population, household income, and in turn consumer spending increasing, driving volume-related revenue sources, such as gaming and liquor sales, land titles, motor vehicle licenses or other premiums and fees . The forecast includes another year of freezing post-secondary tuition fees, saving students $17 million in 2018-19 . New regulation for large emitter compliance payments designed to encourage innovation and reward success. Tuition freeze extended, helping Alberta families and students. Risks Alberta relies heavily on revenue that is volatile and unpredictable, including non-renewable resources, corporate income tax and investment income . Since 2004-05, these have accounted for up to 55% of total revenue, but in 2017-18 they are estimated at only 24% . This revenue is linked to factors such as energy prices, equity markets, exchange and interest rates, geopolitical events, global economic swings and weather, which are all unpredictable and can fluctuate rapidly . The decline in resource revenue and corporate income tax relative to 2014-15 was directly tied to the collapse in oil prices, while investment income has been elevated with strong market returns over the last few years . The degree of revenue uncertainty means the Alberta government must assess the degree of risk associated with its revenue outlook and spending decisions . For the last two years, the government has included an annual risk adjustment . This is $500 million in the 2018-19 fiscal year, $700 million in 2019-20 and then $1 billion in 2020-21 .Alberta fiscal planning complicated by volatility in revenue, but stability in government programs is considered essential. Budget 2018 contains risk adjustments to bottom lines, to signal possible revenue shortfalls.55 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 REVENUEGLOBAL AND US ECONOMIES Budget 2018 assumes global economic expansion of 4% in 2018, propelled by the healthy growth advanced economies achieved in 2017, including the Euro area and Japan, firmer growth in developing economies such as India and Brazil, and a strong US economy . Growth in China continues to decelerate from its recent rapid rates . Substantial risks remain . Weaker-than-forecast global growth would harm Alberta's revenue forecast, as oil prices would remain lower for longer . ENERGY PRICES Oil prices began recovering in mid-2016 . WTI is forecast to average US$54/bbl in 2017-18, $59 in 2018-19, and then to slowly ascend to $63 by 2020-21 . Energy analysts expect long-term prices to reach US$70 within about five years . Price forecasts depend on an array of assumptions about demand and supply . Factors influencing demand include economic growth in disparate regions around the world, from the US to China to Europe, pipeline or refinery outages, and storage and speculative market activities by traders . On the supply side, the level and duration of compliance with the agreement to cut production by OPEC and several non-OPEC members is critical, as has been the response to higher prices by the US industry . Other factors include investment and drilling decisions by other producers, geopolitical events, civil unrest or terrorist strikes, economic sanctions, or simple weather-related production disruptions . Without sufficient pipeline capacity, Alberta's growing bitumen production is being transported by more costly and less safe rail, increasing the light- heavy differential, lowering prices for producers and government revenue . Natural gas prices remain weak due mainly to increasing production of US shale gas that has outstripped demand growth . INTEREST RATES Interest rates have bumped up during the last year, and are forecast to rise gradually over the next several years, as global economic activity continues to pick up, labour markets tighten and inflationary pressures begin to mount . Lower rates generally help government investment income . While short-term investments perform poorly, the market value of bonds with higher rates held in endowment portfolios increase . Lower rates also typically encourage business investment, economic activity and consumer spending, all providing economic support to Alberta's resource-based economy harmed by the oil price weakness . Rising rates pose risks for indebted households, consumer spending and the government, as substantial borrowing is planned, and higher rates make borrowing or refinancing of debt more expensive .Continued solid global economic growth forecast. Energy prices impacted by a variety of global variables, and pipeline access for Canadian producers.56 REVENUE FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 Pdf name: B18-FP_REV_tb14_sfya.pdf Budget 2018 Revenue section (millions of dollars) Change Net Impact Oil price (WTI US$/bbl) -$1 -265 Light-heavy oil -10\u00a2 + 1\u00a2 pdf named: B18-FP_REV_tb14_sfya.pdfSensitivities to Fiscal Year Assumptions, 2018-19a a Sensitivities are based on current assumptions of prices and ra tes and show the effect for a full 12 month period.

Sensitivities can vary significantly at dif ferent price and rate levels. The energy price sensitivities do not include the potential impact of price changes on revenue from land lease sales. A reduction in the natural gas price now increases net revenue, as the negative impact on natural gas royalties is more than offset by the positive impact on bitumen royalties, since costs are lower as natural gas is used in bitumen production. EXCHANGE RATES The US-Canadian dollar exchange rate is forecast to average 80US\u00a2/Cdn$ in 2018-19 and subsequent years, up from 78US\u00a2/Cdn$ in 2017-18 . A stronger Canadian dollar decreases the value of oil exports and the demand for exports priced in Canadian dollars . Changes in the exchange rate affect the profitability of energy producers, which can affect investment and government resource revenue as energy prices and contracts are mainly in US dollars . Investment income is also impacted due to significant foreign holdings in the Heritage Savings T rust Fund and endowment funds . EQUITY MARKETS Equity markets have performed well the last several years, and government investment income has benefited . Markets can be affected by a wide range of factors, such as the strength of the US, European and developing economies, or fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates . Alberta has significant assets invested globally in a variety of asset classes . The investment income forecast is based on recent government performance, and long-term expected rates of return . Financial market performance and investment income could vary considerably . NET CORPORATE OPERATING SURPLUS Corporate profits in Alberta were hit hard in 2015 and 2016, but are rebounding, with reduced labour and other costs, and growing exports and consumer spending . Energy investment declined with the drop in oil prices, and as various energy projects transition from construction to the production phase, but is forecast to stabilize and pick up moderately . However, it can be difficult to predict how forecast net corporate operating surplus translates to corporate income tax revenue, as taxable income can differ significantly from corporate profits, due to tax changes or discretionary deductions such as depreciation or prior-year losses which can be carried forward or back and affect corporate income tax revenue for years .Exchange rate forecast increased to 80US\u00a2/Cdn$ for next three years. Corporate profits and corporate income tax difficult to forecast.57Fiscal Plan Capital Plan58 CAPITAL PLAN FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21Table of Contents CAPITAL PLAN 2018 - 21 CAPITAL PLAN2018 Capital Plan Budget 2018 returns the Capital Plan to normal spending levels while investing in schools, hospitals and roads. pdf name: B18_FP_CP_cpbe_chrt.pdf Budget 2018 Capital Plan section Budget 2018 Capital Plan - Capital Plan by Envelope (% of Total Capital Plan) pdf name: B18_FP_CP_cpbe_chrt.pdfMunicipal Infrastructure Support 25%Capital Maintenance & Renewal 19%Health Facilities & Equipment 17%Climate Change, Environmental Protection & Sustainability 7% Roads & Bridges 12% Schools 8% Other Capital Envelopes 7% Family, Social Supports & Housing 2%Adult Education & Skills 2%Sports, Arts, Recreation & Culture B18_FP_CP-piechart2.xlsx/Cap Plan Allocation chart Updated: 3/14/2018/ 4:14 PMBudget 2018 Capital Plan - Allocation by Envelope (% of Total Capital Plan)Economic recovery is underway and strengthening across Alberta . While the province still has a way to go, things are looking up . When the price of oil collapsed, the government listened to the advice of the former Governor of the Bank of Canada, David Dodge . Instead of making matters worse, the government put Albertans to work building badly needed infrastructure . The plan is working . David Dodge also said that when the economy begins to recover, government should bring spending back to more normal levels . The 2018 Capital Plan does that, while continuing to invest in the vital schools, hospitals and roads that Albertans rely on . As the economy recovers and capital spending returns to more normal levels, continued and strategic investment is critical to promoting growth and employment opportunities in communities across Alberta . The 2018 Capital Plan ensures that promises are kept - that construction continues on previously-announced projects like the Calgary Cancer Centre and Willow Square in Fort McMurray, and that new investments are made in the infrastructure Alberta families need . From schools and hospitals, to roads and bridges, seniors' accommodations and affordable housing, government is investing to ensure Albertans have access to the public infrastructure they require for years to come . Focused on careful and responsible spending, the Capital Plan invests $26 .6 billion over five years, helping the province move forward with its economic recovery . The criteria used to review projects is posted online at: www .infrastructure .alberta .ca/6 .htm60 CAPITAL PLAN FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21Health Care Government is investing $4 .6 billion over five years in capital projects that improve access to health care for Albertans . This investment supports dozens of projects underway including the new hospital in Edmonton; the Calgary Cancer Centre; the Norwood Long Term Care Facility; the Edmonton Clinical Laboratory Hub and capital planning for health in the Red Deer region . This budget also includes $59 million to upgrade the medical instrument cleaning and sterilization units in the Red Deer Regional Hospital and Calgary's Peter Lougheed Centre . Education The 2018 Capital Plan will focus on planning and building modern school facilities to support student learning and wellbeing . This Capital Plan invests $2 .2 billion over the next five years on school infrastructure . The funding includes $393 million for 20 new school projects, and an additional $25 million to fund the continuation of the schools modular program that provides school jurisdictions with additional classroom space to meet varying enrolment needs . Government is investing $641 million in the province's post-secondary infrastructure . Funding supports projects underway throughout Alberta including University of Calgary MacKimmie Complex and the University of Lethbridge Destination Project . This investment also provides $30 million to upgrade the District Energy System for the University of Alberta to increase the capacity of the campus' electrical system . Family, Social Supports and Housing From Slave Lake and Whitecourt in the north, to Edmonton, Fort Saskatchewan and Red Deer in central Alberta, and south to Calgary, Lethbridge and Medicine Hat, government is committed to supporting seniors, at-risk youth, and homeless or low-income individuals and families . The 2018 Capital Plan includes an investment of $50 million to support nine new projects that will increase access to safe, affordable, and barrier-free homes for Alberta families . Roads and Bridges The Capital Plan will invest $5 .6 billion over five years, including $2 .3 billion in Capital Maintenance and Renewal, for major work on roads and bridges as part of the government's commitment to foster economic competitiveness and create jobs . This investment includes completion of existing projects such as the Gaetz Ave-Highway 2 project at Red Deer, the Highway 2-Peace River Bridge, the Grande Prairie-Highway 43X bypass, the Highway 15 bridge at Fort Saskatchewan, Southwest Calgary Ring Road and other critical infrastructure . Alberta will continue to invest in developing key economic corridors to ensure goods are transported cost-effectively, and safely . Environmental Sustainability Government is focused on enhancing the province's environmental sustainability . Over the next five years, programming includes $124 million for sustainable energy programs for Indigenous communities, funding to support a variety of 61 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 CAPITAL PLANenergy efficiency and environmental infrastructure projects . The Capital Plan invests in projects that enhance the way public infrastructure is designed, built, and operated in order to reduce the province's impact on the environment . This includes $22 million for the Foothills Medical Centre Power Plant, $68 million for reducing provincial office space footprints, and $17 million in capital investments for retrofitting affordable housing units to make buildings more environmentally and financially sustainable . Municipal Infrastructure The Capital Plan provides $6 .9 billion for municipalities, including $0 .9 billion for light rail transit . $3 billion is being committed over the next ten years for light rail transit in Edmonton and Calgary . This commitment will help our largest cities grow while cutting GHG emissions . As government addresses its fiscal challenges, and as the end of MSI approaches, funding arrangements with municipalities will be reviewed . Pending a new program, targeted funding under the MSI has been reduced by $152 million each year . The reduction will have the MSI program continuing to end in 2021-22 . The government is committed to working with municipalities, over the coming months, to replace the MSI with a new infrastructure grant program, with a funding formula based on revenue sharing . Annual funding for a number application-based municipal grant programs is also reduced . This reduction extends programs like the Alberta Community T ransit Fund, Strategic T ransportation Infrastructure Program, Municipal and Regional Water and Wastewater programs over the five-year Capital Plan . To provide municipalities with increased flexibility in planning capital projects and adjusting to the new fiscal arrangements, government reprofiled $800 million in MSI funds to municipalities in 2017-18, $400 million from 2018-19 and $400 million from 2019-20 .

21 CAPITAL PLANUnfunded Capital Projects (as of March 22, 2018) As part of the commitment to transparency and openness, the government is presenting a list of unfunded capital projects as an addendum to the Budget 2018 Capital Plan . It is comprised of projects presented by departments that met priority criteria and fit within the three pillars of the Capital Plan: key social programs and services that Albertans rely on; encouraging economic development in communities, and protecting the environment . Some of these projects will receive funding for planning as part the Budget 2018 Capital Plan . If the projects meet the criteria and there is funding available, they will be reflected in future capital plans . Adjustments to the Budget 2018 Capital Plan will be made to address emerging needs and issues around the province . Finally, this list is not all-encompassing, as there are many worthy projects in Alberta that are not reflected here . ...continues next pagepdf named: B18_FP_CP_pip1.pdf Budget 2018 Capital Plan Section Unfunded Capital Projects Infrastructure Project Name Department Ambrose II Community and Social Services Arts Commons Transformation (Calgary Centre for the Performing Arts) Project Culture and Tourism Arts Habitat (Artists Quarters) Project Culture and Tourism Aspen View Public School Division No. 78 (2125): H.A.

In early 2016, the price of oil fell to US$26 per barrel and in one year non-renewable resource revenue plummeted by nearly 70%, from $8 .9 billion to $2 .8 billion . A drop of $6 .1 billion in one year . In the face of a severe recession, the government had a choice . It refused to make a bad situation worse by making drastic cuts that would have put thousands more people out of work, damaged the economy further and hurt Alberta families . Instead, the government put Albertans to work by investing in badly needed schools, hospitals and roads, cushioning the impact of the downturn . It supported the energy industry by securing approval for new pipelines . It helped to make life more affordable by capping electricity rates, freezing tuition, reducing school fees and introducing the Alberta Child Benefit . Government protected the services that matter to Albertans, making sure that our children had teachers in their classrooms and when our loved ones got sick they received the care they needed . Albertans expect no less . At the same time, government took steps to reduce Alberta's dependency on resource revenue and make the taxation system more fair, while still maintaining a significant tax advantage over other provinces . These decisions will provide the province with more stable revenue to support the services Albertans rely on . Government has also worked prudently and carefully to contain costs and eliminate waste . Practical agreements were reached with the Alberta Teacher's Association and United Nurses of Alberta that recognize the province's fiscal situation . Government slashed salaries and eliminated perks and bonuses for some of the highest paid executives at Alberta's agencies, boards and commissions, saving $16 million a year . The government's plan is working . Today, Alberta's economy is looking up . Jobs are up . Exports are up . Manufacturing is up . The province led the country in economic growth in 2017 and is expected to be near the top again in 2018 . While the economy is recovering, not all Albertans are feeling it and there is more work ahead . Budget 2018 is focused on building a recovery to last for all Albertans . The government is committed to return the budget to balance . While the need to absorb the economic shock has diminished, the government will continue to diversify the economy and create jobs while protecting the services Albertans rely on . This chapter outlines the government's plan to balance the budget by 2023-24 .Government supported the economy and Alberta families during the downturn. Government is finding ways to contain costs and eliminate waste. 74 PATH TO BALANCE FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 The Fiscal Challenge OVERDEPENDENCE ON RESOURCE REVENUE Alberta has long depended on resource revenues . This reliance increased over time, making the province vulnerable to a drop in energy prices, as experienced in 2015 (Chart 1) . Earlier this decade, when oil prices were high and the economy was growing, the budget remained unbalanced and savings were not put aside for the future . Between 2010-11 and 2014-15, for example, oil prices averaged US$90/bbl, while the economy grew more than 5% per year - more than double the national average . Royalty revenues averaged $9 .3 billion per year, more than 20% of total revenue . Yet, over this period, the government ran deficits in all but one fiscal year . A reliance on resource revenue makes Alberta's revenues far more volatile than in any other large province . At the same time, Alberta's population and demand for services continue to increase . Rather than providing stability, the government used to have volatile year-to-year spending that accentuated the impact of the revenue roller coaster . In contrast, this government, in the last two years, has provided stability of funding for core public services, including health care, education and social services (Chart 2) . THE OIL PRICE SHOCK WILL HAVE LONG LASTING EFFECTS While the economy is now on firmer footing, the fiscal impact of the 2015 oil price collapse will linger for some time . Oil prices are widely expected to be \"lower for longer\" due to ample and lower-cost global supplies of crude (Chart 3) .Chart 1: Alberta's Dependency on Resource Revenue Non-renewable resource revenues Source: Alberta Energy chrt_01.pdf Note: A change in accounting practice occurred in Budget 2013 affecti ng the comparability of c o0246810121416($billions)Natural Gas Crude Oil Bitumen Bonuses, Rental Fees, OtherChart 1: Alberta's reliance on resource revenue Alberta Non-Renewable Resource Revenue Source: Alberta EnergyResource revenues hit a record high of $14.3 billion in 2005-06. T en years later, these revenues totalled only $2.8 billion. 75 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 PATH TO BALANCEThe largest impact is on resource revenues . In 2018-19, they will be around 40% of 2014-15 levels . Even as oil prices improve and oil production continues to increase, the share of resource revenue in total revenue will remain well below historical norms . More broadly, the oil shock has hit Alberta businesses and families hard . While earnings remained highest among the provinces, they declined during the recession, hurting tax and other government revenue . Nominal GDP , the broadest measure of income, fell $62 billion (or 16%) between 2014 and 2016, and is not expected to return to 2014 levels until 2020 .Chart 2: Alberta's volatile operating expense Operating Expense Growth Source: Government of Alberta Annual Reports, eestimate chrt_02.pdf 200001200102200203200304200405200506200607200708200809200910201011201112201213201314201415201516201617201718e201819f201920f202021f202122f202223f202324f01234567(%)Chart 2: Alberta's volatile operating expense Operating Expense Growth Source: Alberta Treasury Board and Finance, e-estimateOperating expense growth has stabilized and moderated since 2015-16.

A critical step was avoiding the province's history of volatile swings in spending from one year to the next . In 2015-16 and 2016-17, operating expense (excluding CLP initiatives) posted stable and moderate growth of 3 .0% and 3 .1%, well below the 4 .6% average increase in the previous six years . In addition to providing stable funding for core public services, government carefully and prudently found savings . It focused on the two largest areas of spending: public sector compensation, which makes up over half of government's operating expense; and health, government's largest program area . Practical agreements were negotiated with public sector unions like the Alberta Teachers' Association and United Nurses of Alberta that restrained salary growth . Spending growth in Health was contained at 3 .3% per year between 2015-16 and 2017-18, down from an average of 6 .0% annually over the previous six years . The government also chose to stimulate the economy during the downturn through a nation-leading capital plan, delivering on recommendations from former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge . The government took advantage of record low interest rates, a strong balance sheet and lower cost pressures to make long-term investments and put Albertans back to work building badly needed schools, hospitals and roads . The plan worked . Increased government spending on capital provided more economic stimulus than in any previous recession, boosting real GDP growth by over 0 .3 percentage points in both 2015 and 2016 (Chart 4) and supporting about 10,000 new jobs by 2016 . The investment was well timed, with construction near its peak in 2016 when the economy was at its lowest point (Chart 5) . Government continues to work to build a recovery that lasts for working people .77 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 PATH TO BALANCEChart 6: Ramp up in capital spending well timed Alberta Economic Activity and Government Spending on Capital Sources: Statistics Canada and Alberta Treasury Government Building Construction (left) Alberta Activity Index (right)(2014Q1=100) (2014Q1=100)Chart 5: Ramp up in capital spending well timed Alberta Economic Activity and Government Construction Sources: Statistics Canada and Alberta Treasury Board and FinanceGovernment construction increased sharply in late 2015 and early 2016, coinciding with the low point of Alberta's downturn.

Jobs are coming back - 38,000 in the last three months of 2017 alone . Most of the new jobs during the recovery have been in full-time, private sector positions . The oil and gas industry is recovering - rig activity jumped 66% in 2017 . And the recovery is spreading to other sectors: retail sales rose by 7 .5% last year, manufacturing shipments by 14% and international exports by 27% . All told, Alberta led all provinces in economic growth at 4 .5% in 2017, and is once again expected to be near the top in 2018 . The recovery speaks to Alberta's resiliency . Even at US$51/bbl (WTI ) oil - nearly half of 2014 levels - Alberta outperformed all provinces on a number of key economic metrics in 2017, including: Highest average weekly earnings - 17% above the national average . Highest estimated GDP per capita - 34% above the national average (Chart 6) . Highest employment rate (i .e . the share of Albertans 15+ with a job) - 67% compared to 62% nationally .

With the worst behind us, the government is focused on returning Alberta's budget to balance by 2023-24 (Chart 7). Alberta's economic recovery will increase revenue. A stronger labour market will lift wages and employment, driving up personal income tax revenue. Higher oil prices and production will support corporate tax revenue. Other revenues, like fuel taxes and the tourism levy, will also expand as activity picks up and the population grows. Budget 2018 measures will bring the budget to balance by 2023-24.80 PATH TO BALANCE FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 The federally-imposed carbon price will increase carbon revenue based on federal approval of the T rans Mountain Expansion (TMX) and the federal government's commitment to its construction . Resource revenues, while improving over the forecast, are expected to contribute less to government revenue than in the past . By 2023-24, resource revenues are projected to rise to 16% of total revenues, well below the 23% average share over the last 20 years and the high of 37% in 2005-06 (Chart 8) . The Path to Balance is based on realistic revenue projections . The price of oil, an important driver of resource revenues, is based on the average of private sector analysts with a strong understanding of oil market fundamentals . These forecasters indicate that oil prices will remain near US$60/bbl over the next three years, rising to US$73/bbl by 2023-24 as higher cost supplies will be required to meet global demand . The forecast for nominal GDP , the broadest measure of income and a key driver of government revenue, is also closely in line with the private sector average (Chart 9) . While revenues will improve, they are not projected to return to 2013-14 and 2014-15 levels until 2019-20 due to the lingering impacts of the recession and low oil prices (see Economic Outlook and Revenue chapters) . Despite a recovering economy, the budget will not balance itself . That is why the government has developed a balanced, long-term plan . This plan will continue to protect the services Albertans rely on, create jobs and diversify the economy . Through actions taken in Budget 2018 , smaller deficits are projected year after year until the budget is balanced in 2023-24 .Chart 11: A reduced reliance on resource revenue NonRenewable Resource Revenue as Share of Total Government Revenue Source: Government of Alberta Annual Reports, eestimate, fforecast Notes: Since 200809, revenue reported on a consolidated basis, including the SUCH sector.

Private sector forecast available until 2021. The Path to Balance Plan is based on three pillars: 1) A strong and more diversified economy; 2) Stable funding and cost containment; and 3) A lower reliance on volatile resource revenue . 1) A STRONG AND DIVERSIFIED ECONOMY The Path to Balance will be underpinned by a growing and more diversified economy that is built to last . In addition to making significant investments in infrastructure during the downturn, the government has taken a number of steps to promote growth and diversification and create jobs, including: Securing approval of two critical energy infrastructure projects - Line 3 replacement and TMX . These pipelines will provide critical market access as oil sands production continues to rise, supporting investment and jobs (see Economic Outlook chapter) . The addition of Line 3/TMX could lift Alberta's GDP by about 1 .5-2% by 2023 relative to a scenario without new pipelines . Diversifying Alberta's energy sector, and encouraging value-added production . Budget 2018 includes significant new investments in the Petroleum Diversification Program (PDP), petrochemical feedstock infrastructure, and partial upgrading . These initiatives will support up to $13 billion in industry investment, adding 0 .6% to real GDP by 2021 . Creating 3,000 new post-secondary technology spaces and new scholarship programs to support technology and other emerging sectors . A growing economy will lift government revenues. The government's forecast for nominal GDP , a long-term driver of government revenue, is closely aligned with the private sector.82 PATH TO BALANCE FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 Introducing three tax incentives - the Alberta Investor Tax Credit, the Capital Investment Tax Credit and the Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit - to improve access to capital, promote innovation and encourage job creation . Modernizing Alberta's energy royalty framework . The framework is fair and competitive, and provides long-term certainty to the oil and gas industry . Introducing supports for small brewers, doubling the number of brewpubs and brewers across the province . 2) STABLE SPENDING AND COST CONTAINMENT The government will avoid the previous government's history of volatile swings in spending from one year to the next . Instead, this government will target keeping operating expense below population growth plus inflation (Chart 10) . Operating expense is expected to rise 3 .1% per year, on average, from 2018-19 to 2023-24, well below historical growth . To maintain lower operating expense growth, government is containing costs through a focus on its two largest areas of spending - public sector compensation and health - while finding efficiencies across government . Compensation Government is approaching collective bargaining recognizing the unprecedented fiscal challenges . The importance of practical agreements was evident in the agreements with the Alberta Teachers' Association and United Nurses of Alberta . As negotiations in other sectors advance, government will take the same approach, providing job security in exchange for no increases . Government also continues to freeze the salaries of non-union staff across the public sector and a hiring restraint is in place across the public service to keep the size of the Alberta Public Service flat .

A new funding framework has been signed with the Alberta Pharmacists' Association that will save $150 million over the next two years and slow spending growth in government-sponsored drug programs . Alberta has also saved more than $100 million over the last three years by reducing generic drug prices . Alberta Health Services' Operational Best Practices initiative has delivered ongoing efficiencies in health delivery . Finding Efficiencies Continuous improvement is focused on ongoing efforts to achieve the greatest efficiencies and effectiveness across government . Corporate services such as communications, information technologies, finance and human resources are being consolidated and modernized so they are more effective and deliver high levels of service that ultimately support Albertans . Opportunities to contract-in services will also be considered where efficiencies can be achieved . The review of agencies, boards and commissions (ABCs) has led to the elimination or consolidation of 66 ABCs, and salaries have been cut and bonuses eliminated for the highest paid executives of Alberta's ABCs . Discretionary spending is being tightly controlled across government with restrictions on travel, conferences, advertising, publications and hospitality . Capital The government chose to put Albertans to work and stimulate the economy during the downturn, delivering on the recommendations from former Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge . Dodge indicated that as the economy recovers, the government should normalize spending and be prepared to curtail spending further if oil prices remained low . Consistent with his recommendations, government is reducing the capital plan to a more normal investment level starting in 2018-19, with reductions in both capital grants and investment . Alberta currently provides more grants to municipalities than any other province on a per capita basis - about 60% more than the national average .1 Capital grants were enhanced in 2007 with the introduction of the Municipal Sustainability Initiative (MSI), a $11 .3 billion commitment to municipalities . This commitment was made during a period of elevated oil and gas prices; resource revenue totalled $12 .3 billion in 2006-07 and the province had just recorded 13 consecutive budget surpluses . As government addresses its fiscal challenges, and as the end of MSI approaches, funding arrangements with municipalities will be reviewed . Pending a new program, targeted funding under the MSI has been reduced by $152 million each year . The reduction will have the MSI program continuing to end in 2021-22 . The government is committed to working 1. Based on 2016-17 Survey of Provincial Grants to Municipalities, Provincial -T erritorial Officials Committee (PTOC) on Local Government84 PATH TO BALANCE FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 with municipalities, over the coming months, to replace the MSI with a new infrastructure grant program, with a funding formula based on revenue sharing . Annual funding for a number of application-based municipal grant programs is also reduced . This reduction extends programs like the Alberta Community T ransit Fund, Strategic T ransportation Infrastructure Program, Municipal and Regional Water and Wastewater programs over the five-year Capital Plan . To provide municipalities with increased flexibility in planning capital projects and adjusting to the new fiscal arrangements, government reprofiled $800 million in MSI funds to municipalities in 2017-18 . Government will continue to deliver on its commitments for capital investment to build schools, hospitals, highways and other public infrastructure . 3) REDUCING ALBERTA'S RELIANCE ON RESOURCE REVENUE The government is committed to a tax system that is fair and encourages economic growth, while providing the revenue needed to fund public services . Alberta continues to have a significant tax advantage . Albertans and Alberta businesses pay at least $11 .2 billion less in taxes than they would if they faced the same tax system of any other province . For example, a one-income couple earning $75,000 and raising two children pays at least $1,680 less taxes in Alberta than in any other province . At the same time, the government recognizes that the province must reduce its reliance on resource revenue . It has taken a balanced approach, introducing measures that raise revenue but still maintain Alberta's overall tax advantage and keep life affordable for Albertans . Measures introduced include: A more progressive, multiple-rate personal income tax structure was introduced in October 2015 . The government protected 93% of taxfilers by only raising taxes on the top 7% of income earners . Even with the increase, Albertans will continue to pay the lowest overall taxes among provinces . This measure is anticipated to raise $750-800 million in 2018-19 alone, with the amount increasing over time as the economy improves . The general corporate income tax rate, which applies to larger corporations earning income, was raised two percentage points to 12% in July 2015, tied for third lowest among the provinces in 2018 . Alberta's corporate tax system remains among the most competitive in Canada, with no payroll or retail sales tax . This measure is anticipated to raise $350-400 million in 2018-19 alone . Other revenue measures, introduced in Budget 2015 , raise more than $100 million annually . This includes a $5/carton increase in tobacco taxes, a 5% increase in standard liquor mark-ups and a 4 \u00a2/litre increase in locomotive fuel taxes to match the same increase introduced on gasoline and diesel in March 2015 . As Alberta's economy relies less on government stimulus, additional carbon revenue will help contribute to an improving bottom line . Beginning in 2021, additional revenue resulting from the federally-imposed carbon price tied to the construction of the T rans Mountain Pipeline will be used to support vital public services as the province stays on track to balance the budget by 2023-24 . 85 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 PATH TO BALANCEThe federally-imposed carbon price will increase to $40/tonne in 2021 and $50/tonne in 2022, compared to Alberta's price of $30/tonne . STABILIZATION AND DECLINE IN DEBT BURDEN The Path to Balance is expected to lead to a stabilization and decline in the province's debt burden . Alberta will continue to have a strong balance sheet with the net debt-to-GDP ratio, a widely used measure of the debt burden, projected to peak at 13 .1% in 2021-22, before declining to 12 .3% in 2023-24 (Chart 11) . This is below the current net debt-to-GDP ratio of any province in Canada today, and well below the 38% ratio in Ontario and 46% in Quebec for 2016-17 . Overall, the government's Path to Balance plan - based on economic growth and diversification, stable spending and cost containment, and reduced reliance on resource revenue - is a balanced approach to Alberta's fiscal challenge .

Real GDP grew an estimated 4 .5% following a deep twoyear recession . The resurgence was broadbased, with nearly every sector expanding . Exports increased by almost 30% on rising oil production and an expanded manufacturing base . Housing starts grew by 20%, while retail trade expanded 7 .5% . The labour market strengthened throughout the year and recovered all the jobs lost during the recession by December . Building off the surge in activity in 2017, the economy is forecast to expand at a solid rate of 2 .7% in 2018 . Exports will continue to drive growth amid a solid expansion in the global economy, as oil sands output ramps up and production begins at the Sturgeon Refinery . The substantial improvement in the labour market at the end of 2017 is expected to carry through into the new year and boost housing and consumer spending . However, the recovery in business investment will lag the broader economic recovery due to the lingering impacts of the oil price shock . As the economy moves from recovery into expansion (Chart 1), growth will be driven less by exports and more by investment . Nonresidential investment will start to pick up in 2019 . Until pipelines are built, market access challenges are likely to restrain upstream oil and gas investment . However, downstream investment in petrochemical facilities and partial upgraders will help to support real GDP growth of around 2 .5% from 2019 to 2021 . Households, too, will contribute to the expansion, with spending supported by rising incomes and solid population growth of about 1 .5% per year . Alberta has emerged from one of its worst recessions caused by the steepest and most prolonged oil price shock in Canadian history. The economy will shift from recovery to expansion in 2019, when real GDP surpasses pre-recession levels.

The global economy exceeded expectations in 2017 as it rose at its fastest pace since 2011. A concerted rebound in global trade, business investment and industrial production paved the way for a synchronized expansion across countries for the first time following the 2009 global financial crisis. Global growth is forecast to accelerate to 3.7% in 2018 and 2019 from an estimated 3.6% in 2017. A sustained global expansion will support prices and improve prospects for the Alberta economy, given the province's high reliance on trade and commodities. SYNCHRONIZED GLOBAL GROWTH TO CONTINUE Growth prospects for advanced and emerging economies have improved markedly over the past year . While activity accelerated significantly in most advanced economies, the upturn was pronounced in the Euro Area . Real GDP grew by an estimated 2 .5% in 2017, the best growth performance in over a decade . Growth in the region is forecast to proceed at a healthy clip of around 2% in 2018 and 2019 . In the US, a broadbased upswing in business investment, led by the energy sector, contributed to further strengthening in the labour market . Real GDP growth is forecast to accelerate to around 2 .5% in 2018 and 2019 before slowing to around 2% thereafter . Growth in emerging markets is also projected to strengthen in the near term . Firmer commodity prices are fuelling the recovery in resourceexporting countries such as Brazil and Russia, which in turn is boosting global growth . India's economy is forecast to pick up as it recovers from the transitory impact of last year's monetary reforms . Although growth in China's economy is anticipated to slow from an estimated 6 .8% in 2017 to 6 .2% by 2021, it has been revised up from previous forecasts . Strengthening activity in manufacturing and energy boosted global industrial production in 2017.

Global industrial output has been bolstered by betterthanexpected industrial production in China, which consumes half of the world's metal production . An upturn in business investment, led by the energy and manufacturing industries, has also supported industrial output . Amid solid global growth, the increase in industrial production has lifted global trade, which increased 4 .5% last year, the fastest pace since 2011 . It has also led to a surge in prices for base metals such as copper and aluminum since mid2017 . Following last year's exceptional gains, robust global demand should be supportive of the recovery in prices for oil and other nonenergy commodities . LABOUR MARKETS TIGHTEN AMID WEAK INFLATION With growth accelerating, labour markets in many countries have posted significant improvements . Unemployment rates in the US and Canada are near multidecade lows and have declined in the Euro Area, where unemployment was elevated (Chart 3) . Despite these improvements, wage growth and inflation remain subdued . With both the US and Canadian economies operating near capacity, wage growth is likely to pick up in the near term . Rising wages and higher commodity prices will put some upward pressure on inflation as businesses raise prices . Unemployment rates declined as economic activity gained momentum.Chart 3: Labour markets tightening in advanced economies Unemployment Rates in Select Advanced Economies Sources: Statistics Canada, US Bureau of Labor Statistics and Statistical Office of the European CommunitiesWeekly Economic Review December 2, 2016PDF Name: chrt_02.pdf Chart 3: Labour markets tightening in advanced economie s Unemployment Rates in Select Advanced Economies Source: Haver Analytics chrt_03.pdf345678910111213 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017(%)Canada US Euro Area \\\\ter-fin-fs-01\\Publications\\_Economics_publications\\Budget\\5_E conomic-Outlook_2018- 19\\Text_Files_sourceDocs\\: 01_Budget 2018 Charts - EXTERNAL Chart 3 Last Updated: 01_Budget 2018 Charts - EXTERNAL: 4:11 PM96 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FISCAL PLAN 2018 -21 INTEREST RATES RISING GRADUALLY In the aftermath of the 2009 global financial crisis, central banks in advanced economies implemented extraordinary measures to support economic growth, such as exceptionally low policy interest rates and quantitative easing programs . With growth on a solid footing and labour markets finally showing signs of tightening in several advanced economies, monetary policy is shifting (Chart 4) . The US Federal Reserve, which is further ahead in its tightening cycle, implemented three rate hikes in 2017 and announced plans to gradually reduce the size of its balance sheet starting in October 2017 . The Bank of Canada has increased rates three times since mid2017 and the Bank of England reversed rate cuts implemented in 2016 . Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has not raised interest rates due to stubbornly low inflation but has started to scale back its bondbuying stimulus program . Looking ahead, with labour market tightening and inflationary pressures anticipated to build, central banks are expected to continue raising interest rates, albeit at a gradual pace . Even so, monetary policy is expected to be highly accommodative and supportive of growth, as interest rates in most of these countries will remain near historic lows . In light of stronger economic growth, some central banks raised their policy interest rates over the past year.Chart 4: Monetary policy tightening in advanced economies Central Bank Policy Rates Sources: Bank of Canada, Bank of England and US Federal Reserve BoardChart 4: Monetary policy tightening in advanced economies Policy rates in Canada, U.K. and the U.S. Source: Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Federal Reserve Board chrt_04.pdf0123456(%) Canada UK US97 FISCAL PLAN 2018 -21 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK MODEST IMPROVEMENT IN OIL PRICES The global oil market is rebalancing against a backdrop of supply restraint and accelerating global economic growth . Global oil demand has benefitted from a broadbased expansion in industrial activity over the past year . An agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and several nonOPEC producers to extend output cuts until the end of this year, combined with strong compliance with the agreement, has helped reduce the supply glut . Global crude inventories have fallen from the record high reached in 2016 . With synchronized global growth lending support to oil demand and lower inventories, oil prices have improved . The US, however, remains a key driver of global supply growth (Chart 5) . US production has been rising steadily since late 2016, when oil prices moved up to US$50/bbl . In late 2017, production reached a record high . With US shale oil producers very responsive to higher prices, expanding production is expected to keep a lid on price growth this year . West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the North American benchmark oil price, is forecast to average US$59 bbl in 201819 . US will remain a key source of growth in global oil supply in the near term.

These factors are expected to keep oil prices contained over the next 34 years . WTI is forecast to rise to US$63/bbl by 202021, which is still well below the levels seen prior to the downturn (Chart 6) . Canadian Economy Following lacklustre growth in 2016, the Canadian economy grew at an exceptionally strong pace in the first half of 2017 . This was largely driven by a rebound in Alberta's economy . Momentum slowed in the second half of the year as growth in Alberta moderated, particularly in the oil and gas sector (Chart 7) . Even so, industrial capacity utilization rates surged in 2017 and the Canadian economy led growth among G7 economies, at 3 .0% . Economic activity is shifting to a more sustainable pace . Real GDP growth is forecast to moderate to a still solid pace of 2 .2% in 2018 and 2 .0% in 2019 before averaging around 1 .8% over the medium term . Consumer spending is expected to contribute to growth, underpinned by strong job gains and improvement in wage growth . Meanwhile, higher interest rates, elevated household debt and changes to housing policy are likely to cool down residential activity . Firmer oil prices, strong global growth and industrial capacity pressures in the US and Canada are anticipated to bolster business investment and exports, although uncertainty surrounding the NAFTA negotiations is weighing on the nearterm outlook .Chart 6: Muted outlook for oil prices West Texas Intermediate Source: Alberta Energy, e-estimate, f-forecastChart 6: Muted outlook for oil prices West Sources: Alberta Energy, e-estimate, f-forecast chrt_06.pdf 2012-13 2013-142014-152015-162016-172017-18e2018-19f2019-20f2020-21f020406080100120(US$/bbl)Oil prices are expected to improve but remain well below pre-recession levels.99 FISCAL PLAN 2018 -21 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK While the Bank of Canada is expected to raise interest rates gradually, it is likely to take a cautious approach as it considers the economy's response to higher interest rates, given elevated household debt levels and the recent moderation in economic growth . Even though the Canadian dollar has come under pressure recently, rising interest rates and a modest recovery in oil prices should provide support .

Real GDP growth is forecast to be 2.7%, driven by rising exports and strong consumer spending. Beyond 2018, the Alberta economy is set to shift into expansion mode at a solid pace of around 2.5%, consistent with robust population growth, an upturn in investment and a broadening of activity across all sectors of the economy. TRANSITION FROM RECOVERY TO EXPANSION The Alberta economy is well on its way to fully recovering from one of the worst recessions of the last 40 years . Following a surge in activity in 2017, some economic measures have already surpassed 2014 levels, notably retail sales and employment . However, given the depth of the downturn, the recovery has been drawn out . The economy is not expected to move into expansion until 2019, when the level of economic output (measured by real GDP) surpasses prerecession levels . Although overall employment has recovered, employment in some industries is still below prerecession levels . The unemployment rate remains elevated as people continue to enter the labour force and is not forecast to move near prerecession rates until 2021 . Exports will continue to propel growth during the recovery as oil production rises and capacity expands in the manufacturing sector . Real exports are forecast to increase almost 5% in 2018 and around 3% between 2019 and 2021 (Chart 8) . As the pace of production moderates, growth will be driven less by exports and more by investment . Business investment, which has lagged the rest of the recovery, is expected to turn around starting in 2019 . Although the outlook for oil and gas investment is muted, investment in nonresidential construction, in particular manufacturing, is expected to help fuel the economic expansion .

As exports slow, growth will be increasingly driven by domestic demand.101 FISCAL PLAN 2018 -21 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK The service sector is expected to contribute more to real GDP growth than the goods sector starting in 2019, as rising business activity and consumer spending boost demand for various services such as finance and real estate, wholesale and retail trade . OIL PRODUCTION DRIVES EXPORTS With several large oil sands projects finishing construction and ramping up, oil production is set to grow significantly (Chart 9) . In 2018, production is forecast to increase more than 360,000 barrels per day (bpd), following an increase of almost 300,000 bpd in 2017 . Of the various projects coming online in 2018, the largest is the Fort Hills oil sands mine, which drew first oil early this year and is expected to reach 90% of its 194,000 bpd nameplate capacity by the fall of 2018 . Another 380,000 bpd of production is expected to be added from 2019 to 2021, when a number of in situ expansion projects are expected to become operational . This will bring Alberta oil production to just under four million bpd and maintain Canada's position as one of the world's largest oil producers . ALBERTA'S MANUFACTURING BASE CONTINUES TO EXPAND Exports will be further supported by capacity expansions in Alberta's manufacturing sector which will add value to Alberta's resources and boost growth across several sectors of the economy . Following an estimated increase of over 7% in 2017, real manufacturing exports are expected to increase close to 4% in 2018 . Petroleum manufacturing will be boosted by the Sturgeon Refinery, which produced its first barrel of diesel at the end of 2017 . Production at Canada's first new refinery in over 30 years will ramp up throughout the year, eventually reaching its 80,000 bpd capacity . Chemical manufacturing was given a boost in 2017, thanks in part to the completion of the Joffre polyethylene plant expansion . Capacity expansions in Alberta's energy and manufacturing sectors are increasing output and providing the catalyst for growth during the recovery.Chart 9: Strong growth in oil production Contribution to Change in Alberta Real Exports Source: Alberta Treasury Board and Finance, e-estimate, f-forecast2016 Budget Economic OutlookPDF Name: EO16_chrt_10.pdf Chart 9: Oil exports continue to grow Contribution to Change in Alberta Real Exports Source: Alberta Treasury Board and Finance, e-estimate, f-forec ast ALBERTA/Chart 9 Exports 3/14/2018: 3:59 PM102 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FISCAL PLAN 2018 -21 Further petrochemical capacity expansions through the province's Petrochemical Diversification Program (PDP) are expected to come online by 2021 . Food manufacturing will increase in 2019 when the $360million Cavendish Farms potato processing plant in Lethbridge moves into production . These projects will keep real manufacturing exports growing at 3 .3% on average between 2019 and 2021 . AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY REMAIN STEADY Alberta's agriculture and forestry industries are expected to see solid growth in 2018 following a strong expansion in 2017 . Last year, Alberta's agrifood exports grew by 12%, supported by the reopening of a beef packing plant in Balzac (Chart 10) . Crop exports surged, while higher prices supported farm cash receipts . Despite some regionally adverse weather, overall improved growing conditions led to strong production of wheat and canola . This is expected to boost Alberta's crop exports . Livestock and meat demand is likely to see moderate growth, supported by growing global demand for quality protein options . In the forestry sector, lumber producers will continue to benefit from elevated prices . Tight supply and strong demand in the US have so far enabled Canadian producers to pass softwood lumber duties onto US consumers . While ongoing uncertainty in the NAFTA renegotiations poses significant risks to the outlook for the agriculture and forestry sectors, other trade agreements are set to create new business opportunities . The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for T ransPacific Partnership (CPTPP) was signed in March 2018 . It is anticipated to take effect as early as the end of 2018 and will enhance Alberta's access to key Asian markets and support growth in these industries .Agri-food shipments rebounded strongly in 2017.

This is mainly due to ongoing pipeline bottlenecks . The WTI WCS differential is forecast to increase from around US$14 .50/bbl in 201718 to over US$20/bbl in 201819 (Chart 11) . The approval and startup of two pipelines, the Enbridge Line 3 replacement and T rans Mountain Expansion (TMX), will alleviate pipeline bottlenecks in 2020 and 2021 (see Box 1) . However, the lightheavy differential is forecast to remain wide as new rules on the sulphur content of marine fuels from the International Maritime Organization go into effect . This is expected to reduce demand for bunker fuel, which mainly comes from heavy oil, and reduce heavy oil prices . The wider differential will weigh on oil sands investment, which is forecast to fall by 10% in 2018 and recover moderately over the remainder of the forecast period . The decline in 2018 is largely driven by a reduction in spending following the completion of the Fort Hills oil sands mine and the Horizon Phase 3 expansion in 2017 . Companies continue to focus on containing costs, which allowed operators to reduce sustaining capital outlays in 2017 . However, sustaining capital requirements in 2018 and throughout the forecast period are expected to increase along with oil production . Investment will also be boosted primarily by thermal expansion projects, which will add around 250,000 barrels per day of additional capacity between 2019 and 2021 . NATURAL GAS SURPLUS TO UNWIND GRADUALLY North America continues to be awash in natural gas . Drillers in Alberta are increasingly targeting natural gas liquidsrich deposits . This is mainly to feed the demand for condensate, which is used to dilute bitumen for transportation by pipeline and commands a much higher price than natural gas, since it is WTI-WCS differential widens in 2018 as oil production outstrips pipeline capacity.

However, just as the effects of the oil price collapse have started to fade, in part because of an improvement in oil prices, the challenges of market access have moved to the fore. Alberta heavy oil prices are once again trading at a large discount to global benchmarks. Long forecasted pipeline bottlenecks and an increasing reliance on rail are lifting transportation costs for Alberta heavy oil and widening the differential. Lack of market access is hurting heavy oil producers, government revenues and the Canadian economy. Alberta bitumen is priced at a discount to WTI because of the lower quality of heavy oil and the cost of transporting it to market. The discount is measured through the light-heavy (L/H) differential. Without sufficient pipeline access, producers incur higher transportation costs shipping their crude by rail. Two pipeline projects approved by the federal government, TMX and the Enbridge Line 3 Expansion, would add almost 1 million bpd of transportation capacity by 2021 and alleviate bottlenecks (Chart 12). Keystone XL would provide additional longer-term access. Market access also allows for diversification to markets where heavy oil is fetching the highest price, reducing the discount on Alberta bitumen prices relative to global prices. Currently there is limited pipeline capacity to the two largest heavy oil markets in the world, the US Gulf Coast and Asia. TMX is critical, as it would allow producers to sell into the lucrative Pacific market. Keystone XL would provide additional access to the US Gulf Coast, a region with one of the world's largest coking capacity and a key market for Alberta's heavy crude. The economic impacts of market access are significant. Additional pipeline capacity would allow Alberta producers to receive up to US$7/bbl more. This would lift capital investment by an estimated $10 billion and production capacity by 190,000 bpd over the period 2018 to 2023 compared with a scenario without additional pipeline access. The impact to real GDP is estimated at 1.5-2% by 2023. Higher production and prices would boost royalties by up to $10.5 billion between 2018 and 2023. Additional pipeline access is expected to alleviate pipeline bottlenecks by 2021.Chart 12: Pipeline access needed for oil sands production Pipeline and Refinery Capacity and Western Canada Heavy Oil Production Source: Alberta Energy, f-forecast2017 Budget Economic OutlookPDF Name: chrt_10.pdf Chart 12: Pipeline access needed for oil sands production Pipeline and Refinery Capacity and Western Canada Heavy Oil Pro duction Source: Alberta Energy, f-forecast chrt_12.pdfRail 2022f 2023f(Mbpd) Total Western Canada Heavy Oil Production Current Pipeline Capacity Western Canada Refinery CapacityCurrent Pipeline Capacity Western Canada Refinery Capacity \\\\terfinfs01\\Publications\\_Economics_publications\\Budget\\5_E conomicOutlook_2018 19\\Text_Files_sourceDocs\\/02_Budget 2018 Charts ALBERTA Chart 12 Pipeline Access Box 3/15/2018: 2:21 PM105 FISCAL PLAN 2018 -21 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK priced more closely to WTI . Condensate production has more than doubled since 2016 . Demand for natural gas in Alberta is expected to rise over the next several years due to expanding oil sands operations, the continued transition to gas power generation and the expanding petrochemical industry in Alberta . In addition, two new propane terminals in BC - Pembina's project in Prince Rupert and the Alta Gas project on Ridley Island - will boost demand for propane . However, imports are expected to rise as T ransCanada Pipeline expands its Nova Gas T ransmission System connecting BC gas to Alberta . Natural gas prices in Alberta will only improve modestly . The Alberta reference price for natural gas is forecast to rise gradually from $2 .00 in 201819 to $2 .40 in 202021 . CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS DRIVES ENERGY INVESTMENT The conventional oil and gas sector is seeing a resurgence in activity . As a result, conventional investment is set to overtake oil sands (Chart 13) . In 2017, investment is estimated to have increased by almost 60% as producers responded to higher oil prices by increasing drilling . Despite low natural gas prices, Alberta liquidsrich plays remain competitive compared with other areas in North America because of low drilling costs and proximity to the condensate market . Alberta's emerging crude oil plays are becoming more understood and offer fast returns . Increased interest in conventional oil and gas activity, particularly in the expanding Montney and Duvernay plays, resulted in $505 million worth of Crown land sales in 2017, more than triple 2016 sales . Rising prices for condensate and light oil will support conventional oil and gas investment, which is forecast to expand nearly 6% this year . Some cost escalation is expected in 2018 as service companies increase rates that had been cut during the downturn . Between 2019 and 2021, investment is forecast to grow an average of 4 .6% annually .

Building permits, a leading indicator of construction activity, fell considerably over the last two years . Commercial and industrial construction continues to be weighed down by elevated commercial real estate vacancies and the pullback in oil sands investment . A bright spot, however, is the manufacturing sector . According to Statistics Canada's Survey of Investment Intentions, manufacturing investment is set to increase by almost $800 million this year (Chart 14) . Construction has started on the $3 .5 billion Heartland Petrochemical Complex that is slated to come online in 2021, while frontend engineering work has begun on a second polypropylene facility . Both of these projects were granted royalty credits through the Petrochemical Diversification Program . Overall, nonresidential investment is expected to decline 1 .9% in 2018 before rebounding by 2 .5% in 2019 . Growth accelerates to 5 .0% by 2021, largely due to capacity expansions in the manufacturing sector . Budget 2018 contains several new measures to further support downstream oil and gas investment . These initiatives are intended to diversify Alberta's energy sector and get the best value from Alberta's oil and gas resources . The three measures include a second round of funding for petrochemical facilities, support for straddle plants to extract natural gas liquids, and support for partial upgraders, which will improve the quality of bitumen so that it is easier to transport and can be processed by a wider variety of refinery configurations . These new measures could support up to $13 billion in capital investment, which would add 0 .6 per cent to real GDP by 2021 . Investment in manufacturing capacity will help support the recovery in private non-energy investment.Chart 14: Manufacturing investment to surge Change in Alberta Manufacturing Investment Source: Statistics Canada, e-estimate, i-intentions2017 Budget Economic OutlookPDF Name: chrt_15.pdf Chart 14: Manufacturing investment to surge Change in Alberta Manufacturing Investment Sources: Statistics Canada, e-estimate, i-intentions chrt_14.pdf-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.60.81.0 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017e 2018i($billions)Other Petroleum, Chemical and Related Food & Beverage Total Manufacturing \\\\terfinfs01\\Publications\\_Economics_publications\\Budget\\5_E conomicOutlook_2018 19\\Text_Files_sourceDocs\\/02_Budget 2018 Charts ALBERTA Chart 14 Mfg Investment 3/14/2018: 4:02 PM107 FISCAL PLAN 2018 -21 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SERVICE SECTOR IMPROVES The service sector in Alberta makes up about 60% of the economy and fared better than the goods sector during the recession . It is expected to benefit from rising exports and growing business and consumer spending within Alberta . With oil and manufacturing output growing substantially and nonresidential investment set to improve starting in 2019, rising spending within the business sector will provide a boost to professional, scientific and technical services and transportation and warehousing . Accommodation and food and other services in Alberta will also get a lift from increased businessrelated travel . Population and income growth will continue to drive demand for consumer services like finance and real estate and retail trade . In addition to the demand for services within Alberta, service exports are forecast to continue recovering in 2018 and grow at a steady pace of around 3% over the medium term . Amid a solid outlook for the global economy, rising interprovincial and international trade will boost service exports . The tourism sector is likely to perform well following solid gains in 2017 . Domestic and international visits are expected to get a boost from this year's CanadaChina Year of Tourism, as well as enhanced air capacity and connectivity to Canada and the US from Calgary's airport . Strengthening energy investment in the US and other jurisdictions will increase the demand for services from Alberta's oil and gas sector . Overall, the service sector in Alberta is forecast to expand by 1 .9% in 2018 and 2 .3% over the medium term . PROLONGED RECOVERY IN NOMINAL GDP Despite the recovery in economic activity, the lingering effects of the recession and oil price decline are prolonging the recovery in nominal GDP , a broad measure of income . It is expected to grow annually by 5 .2% between 2018 and 2021, but not to return to prerecession levels until 2020 . While oil prices have improved, they remain far below where they were in 2014 . This means that the volume of oil exports in 2019 is expected to be 40% higher than in 2014, but the dollar value of those exports is expected to be 10% lower . Cost containment and a rebounding economy are bolstering corporate profits, which are forecast to grow by almost 20% per year between 2019 and 2021 (Chart 15); however, with oil prices not expected to exceed US$63/bbl, corporate profits will remain below 2014 levels over the next three years . This is in contrast to household earnings, which should exceed 2014 levels beginning this year . 108 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FISCAL PLAN 2018 -21 LABOUR MARKET RENEWAL Building on the momentum in the labour market from the second half of 2017, employment growth is expected to accelerate in 2018 . In the last three months of 2017, employment increased sharply, marking a full recovery of jobs lost during the recession . This improvement was due to increases in full time and private sector positions which are expected to extend into this year . Alongside steady growth in the service sector, solid conventional oil and gas activity and additional capacity in the manufacturing sector will boost job gains in the goods sector and support employment growth of 2 .0% in 2018 . Solid employment growth is expected throughout the forecast period as goodsproducing industries, which suffered the largest job declines, continue to recover jobs and investment in nonresidential construction picks up . Employment growth is expected to average 1 .7% by 2021 . Continued improvement in the labour market, especially in the highpaying goods sector, will bolster earnings . With more fulltime employment and hours worked, average weekly earnings (AWE) are forecast to expand by 2 .4% in 2018 and around 3% annually between 2019 and 2021 . This will support primary household income growth of 4 .5% in 2018 and lift household income above the prerecession level . Growth in primary household income is forecast to pickup to almost 5% by 2021 . With inflation fairly steady, households will see real incomes rise over the medium term . UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS GRADUALLY With more Albertans working by the end of 2017, Alberta's unemployment rate responded quickly . It fell from an elevated 8 .1% in August to a two year low of 7 .0% by December . As employment advances again this year, the unemployment rate is forecast to fall further to average 6 .8% .

It surpasses pre-recession levels in 2020. 109 FISCAL PLAN 2018 -21 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK the depth of the recession and the prolonged recovery, the unemployment rate will not move near prerecession rates until 2021, when it is forecast to average 5 .3% . The improvement can be attributed to rising employment over the next four years as the expanding economy provides jobs for people entering the labour market (Chart 16) . Population aging is also playing a part as more people retire from the work force . The labour force participation rate has been trending downward at a rate of about 0 .2 percentage points per year since 2009 . This trend has coincided with an increase in the share of the population over 65 . Both these trends are expected to continue over the forecast, with the labour force participation rate falling from 72 .4% in 2017 to 71 .7% in 2021 . Even then, Alberta is expected to continue having the highest participation rate among the provinces . POPULATION GROWTH PICKS UP Alberta's population is set to grow at a faster pace as the effects of the recession continue to fade . After two years of net outflows, interprovincial migration was again positive in the third quarter of 2017, and net inflows of 2,000 interprovincial migrants are expected in 2018 . The reversal in interprovincial migrant flows was largely due to less outmigration, as improving economic conditions and affordable housing encouraged more Alberta residents to stay in the province . In addition, Alberta's relatively young population is producing robust natural increase of about 0 .8% per year, faster than any other province . Continued strong natural increase and solid immigration into the province are expected to support population growth of 1 .4% in 2018, well above the national increase of around 1% .

As Alberta's economy continues to strengthen and labour prospects improve, net interprovincial migration is forecast to pick up gradually, rising to 8,000 by 2021 . The modest turnaround in net interprovincial migration boosts population growth to 1 .6% by 2021 (Chart 17) . INCOME AND POPULATION GROWTH FUEL HOUSEHOLD SPENDING Following a surge in 2017 when retail sales reached a new high, Albertans are expected to keep spending in 2018 and over the medium term . The increase is being driven by rising employment, wages and population . In 2018, real consumer spending (adjusted for inflation) is forecast to grow a solid 2 .9% . Spending is expected to shift more to services and nondurable goods and away from durable goods, which saw an estimated real increase of almost 12% in 2017 . With inflation expected to remain stable at around 2%, real household consumption is expected to grow by around 3 .0% per year over the forecast, making a strong contribution to overall economic growth . On the housing side, elevated inventories, higher interest rates and tighter mortgage rules are expected to keep housing starts contained this year at around 30,000, almost the same level as 2017 . However, construction that began in 2017 will continue into 2018, which will support almost 9% growth in real residential investment . On the back of Alberta's more affordable housing market and a net inflow of over 42,000 people by 2021, residential building activity is forecast to pick up over the next four years (Chart 18) . Housing starts are expected to rise to 35,200 by 2021, while steady spending on renovations is expected to bolster residential expenditures . Improving economic and labour market conditions will bring net interprovincial migration back into positive territory starting in 2018.

With oil production outstripping pipeline capacity starting this year, prolonged market access issues could lead to a wider differential, weighing on incomes and investment . Monetary policy in advanced economies could tighten faster than anticipated . In Canada, highly indebted households remain vulnerable to a fasterthanexpected increase in interest rates . In addition to its impact on commodity prices, strongerthanexpected global growth is likely to boost export demand . However, the threat of protectionist trade policies, such as those related to the NAFTA renegotiations, is a key risk to the trade outlook .Chart 17: Expanding population sustains demand for hou s Alberta Housing Starts and Total Net Migration Sources:Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, Statistics Can ada and Alberta Treasury Board and Finance, f forecast. chrt_17.pdf0102030405060708090100 051015202530354045 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018f 2019f 2020f 2021f(thousands) (thousands)Housing Starts (left) Total Net Migration (right) Sources: Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, Statistics Canada and Alberta Treasury Board and Finance, f-forecast.Chart 18: Expanding population sustains demand for housing Alberta Housing Starts and Total Net Migration Residential construction activity to strengthen on the back of improving labour market and pick-up in population growth.112 BLANK PAGE113Annex114 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FISCAL PLAN 2018 -21 Benchmarking Tables a Alberta Energy also surveys, on a confidential basis, private sector forecasts from PIRA, the Bank of Montreal, IHS Markit, Stratas Advisors, and Wood Mackenzie; the futures price of oil is also included in the basket.

Alberta continues to have the most competitive overall tax environment for small business owners, with no payroll or sales tax, and no health premium . When all taxes are taken into consideration, Alberta small business owners are better-off than they would be in other provinces . Supporting Alberta Families The government is committed to making life better for everyday Albertans . This includes a tax system that supports lower and middle-income families by keeping their taxes low, and providing significant children's benefits and a carbon levy rebate . Alberta's tax system is also annually indexed to inflation to ensure that the value of Alberta's basic non-refundable tax credits is not eroded over time, and that taxpayers are not pushed into higher tax brackets . Credit amounts and bracket thresholds will rise by 1 .2% in 2018, saving Albertans roughly $65 million (see page 131 for more information) . NON-REFUNDABLE TAX CREDITS Alberta's high tax credit amounts allow individuals to earn more before they have to pay provincial income tax . Basic personal and spousal amounts are $18,915 each in 2018, the highest among provinces . After taking into account the most commonly claimed non-refundable tax credits and refundable children's credits: A working single individual can earn at least $20,068 before paying provincial income tax . A working single parent with two children can earn at least $51,969 before paying provincial income tax . A senior couple can make up to $51,283 before paying provincial income tax . 126 TAX PLAN FISCAL PLAN 2018 -21 Alberta Family Employment Tax Credit (AFETC) and Alberta Child Benefit (ACB) Program Parameters, 2018-19 AFETC benefits are phased in on family working income.

An estimated 120,000 families will receive about $175 million in benefits in 2018-19 through the ACB, a benefit provided to families with an annual family net income below $42,255 . A family with one child could receive up to $1,128 in the 2018-19 benefit year, while a family with two children could receive as much as $1,692 . An estimated 180,000 families will receive about $153 million in benefits in 2018-19 through the AFETC, a tax credit targeted towards working families with annual employment income over $2,760 . A family with one child could receive up to $783 in the 2018-19 benefit year, while a family with two children could receive as much as $1,495 . These two credits are refundable, meaning recipients do not have to pay taxes to receive them . As with personal tax credits, benefit amounts are also annually indexed to inflation and will rise 1 .2% for the 2018-19 benefit year . Lower and middle-income households also benefit from the Alberta Climate Leadership Adjustment Rebate, which helps protect them from the costs of the carbon levy . In 2018, the rebate is worth up to $300 for singles, $450 for couples and $540 for couples with two children ($45 per child to a maximum of four children) . An estimated 1 .2 million households will receive a rebate in 2018-19, with total benefits estimated at $525 million .The ACB and AFETC will provide $328 million to Alberta families. $525 million in carbon levy rebates will be distributed to Alberta households.127 FISCAL PLAN 2018 -21 TAX PLAN Benefit Amounts First adult $ 300 Spouse/equivalent to spouse $ 150 Each child (max. 4) $ 45 Phase-out Thresholds (Family Net Income) Single $ 47,500 Couples & families $ 95,000 Income at which Rebate is Fully Phased Out (Family Net Income) Single $ 55,000 Couple $ 103,750 Couple with 2 children $ 106,000 Couple with 4 children $ 108,250 Phase-out Rates Single 2.67% Couples & families 4.00%Alberta Climate Leadership Adjustment Rebate Parameters, 2018-19 Equivalent to spouse includes a common-law partner as reported on income tax forms, or the first child in single-parent households.

For example, a single parent with two children earning $16,500 a year through a part-time job would receive $3,682 from these three programs, a boost to their income of over 20% .128 TAX PLAN FISCAL PLAN 2018 -21 Cannabis Alberta will collect revenue on the sale of cannabis when it is legalized in 2018 . In December 2017, federal and provincial governments agreed to a common set of principles that would cover the first two years of legalization . These principles focus on coordinating cannabis taxation and revenue, and keeping cannabis prices low to curtail the illegal market . Under these principles, tax room of $1 per gram or 10% of the producer price, whichever is greater, will be shared between federal and provincial governments . The provinces will receive 75% of this tax room, and can also collect an additional tax, or equivalent, of up to 10% of the retail price . Alberta agrees to have the federal government use the federal excise tax to collect the following amounts on the province's behalf: The province's share of the agreed-upon tax room, which is the greater of 75 cents per gram or 7 .5% of the producer price; An additional amount equivalent to 10% of the retail price, similar to what will be applied in other provinces . This amount will be collected at the licensed producer level . Consistent taxation and pricing across the country will help push out the illegal market . Federal collection of these amounts also minimizes administration costs to the provincial government and compliance costs to business . The amounts collected on Alberta's behalf will be distributed to the province . Revenue for Alberta under the federal-provincial agreement is estimated to be $26 million in 2018-19 and $80 million in 2019-20 . Revenue is expected to grow as the legal market gradually takes market share away from the illegal market . The Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission (AGLC) will also be able to collect a markup on wholesale distribution and on retail sales made through the public online system . As agreed to by Finance Ministers, these markups are limited to covering the costs of AGLC's cannabis operations and a reasonable profit margin . See the Revenue Chapter (page 43) for more information .Alberta will work to drive out the illegal cannabis market by keeping prices as low as possible. A coordinated approach to cannabis taxation helps keep prices consistent and lowers costs for the province and Alberta businesses. 129 FISCAL PLAN 2018 -21 TAX PLAN Budget 2018 Tax PlanPDF name: TP16_chrt_03.pdf TP18_chrt_03.pdfSources: Alberta Treasury Board and Finance Affairs51% 49% 1994 25%75% Provincial Municipal2016 S:\\TBF\\EFP\\TP\\TAXBUDGET\\TAXBUDGET201819\\Tables\\Education Pr operty Tax Table\\ Distribution of Property Tax Pie Chart (Updated for Budget 201 8): 8 For Budget 3/1/201810:05 AMSources: Alberta Treasury Board and Finance and Alberta Municipal AffairsDISTRIBUTION OF PROPERTY TAXEducation Property Tax Revenue from the education property tax is a stable source of funding for Alberta's education system, helping to ensure students have the best education possible . The total education property tax requisition will be frozen for 2018-19 to help make life more affordable for Albertans . While the amount of tax collected is frozen, the residential/farmland rate will go from $2 .48 to $2 .56 per $1,000 of equalized assessment and the non-residential rate will go from $3 .64 to $3 .76 due to lower assessed values in 2016 . This revenue will fund about 31% of education operating costs, which is lower than the 32% of education operating costs funded annually from 2013-14 to 2016-17 .

Health premiums are assumed to be borne by individuals. In provinces that impose payroll taxes, 75% is assumed to be borne by employees and 25% by employers. Fuel tax is based on estimated consumption of 3,000 litres of gasoline per year for one-income families and 4,500 litres of gasoline for two- income families. Carbon charges are based on the fuel tax gasoline consumption assumptions and natural gas consumption of 135 GJ/year for a family of four. Only direct carbon charges are applied and are net of related credit programs (e.g. ACLAR). Cap-and-trade systems such as those in place in Ontario and Quebec are not included.

Effective April 1, 2018, the additional rate in the Victoria area will increase from 3.5\u00a2/litre to 5.5\u00a2/litre. h These provinces apply their PST or the provincial portion of their HST on the retail price of the good inclusive of excise taxes. i An additional 3\u00a2/litre is imposed in the Montreal area. j Only legislated carbon levy and tax rates are included in this table. Provincial cap-and-trade programs are excluded. It is estimated that cap- and trade adds approximately 4.3\u00a2/litre to the price of fuel in Ontario and Quebec. k BC's rates are slightly lower than Alberta's because Alberta's rates are based on updated Environment Canada emission factors. Beginning April 1, 2018 and for the following three years, BC's carbon tax will be increased annually by $5 per tonne of CO 2-equivalent emissions. New rates reflecting the 2018 increase have not been included because rates for specific fuels have not been announced. l BC's tax on a carton of cigarettes will increase from $49.40 to $55.00 on April 1, 2018. Ontario announced that its tax on a carton of cigarettes will be increased from $32.95 to $36.95 in 2018, but has not announced the exact date of the increase. m BC will introduce a 1.95% payroll tax in 2019. Quebec levies an additional temporary payroll tax of 4.48% on wages and salaries paid by financial institutions.137Fiscal Plan Tables138 FISCAL PLAN TABLES FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21FISCAL PLAN TABLES Statement Amounts presented in tables may not add to totals due to rounding.139 FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21 FISCAL PLAN TABLESpdf named: B18_FP_TBS_02-soo.pdf Budget 2018 Fiscal Plan Tables Statement of Operations (millions of dollars) 2016-17 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 Actual Budget Forecast Estimate Target income tax 10,763 11,177 3,661 3,823 3,940 Culture and Tourism 336 348 372 381 353 353 Economic Development and Trade 270 345 314 289 274 298 477 695 522 521 Environment and Parks 458 559 629 526 540 527 Executive Council 18 19 18 19 19 19 Health 20,655 21,449 21,423 22,057 22,739 23,435 Indigenous Relations 184 188 179 190 188 187 Infrastructure 619 694 667 670 677 688 Justice and Solicitor General 1,400 1,407 1,517 Labour 699 706 Service Alberta 435 459 471 511 500 474 Status of Women 7 7 7 7 7 7 Transportation 1,301 2,286 2,089 1,653 1,674 Legislative Assembly 119 130 124 165 158 133 2013 Alberta flood assistance 123 53 22 24 - - Climate Leadership Plan 1,381 936 968 1,458 1,578 1,484 Operating expense in-year savings - (200) - - - - Unallocated disaster / emergency assistance - 200 - 200 200 200 Total Program Expense 52,602 53,754 Pension provisions Expense 53,077 54,915 55,947 56,181 57,827 59,818 Risk Adjustment - (500) Surplus / (deficit) (10,784) (10,497) (9,066) (8,802) (millions of dollars) a The 2016-17 Actual, 2017-18 Budget, and 2017-18 Forecast numbers have been restated on the 2018-19 basis, reflecting re-organized ministry structures.

less risk adjust. starting 2018-19 (931) (476) st Tbl 3/15/2018/1:18 AMa Numbers are not strictly comparable due to numerous accounting policy changes over time. Examples include reporting certain items (transfers through the tax system, crude oil marketing and transportation costs, allowance for corporate income tax doubtful accounts) as expense, instead of netting the amounts from related revenue, increasing both revenue and expense, but not impacting the surplus / (deficit). 2015-16 revenue includes $84 million in donations to post-secondary and health authority endowments, which were not reported as revenue in prior years but rather as \"adjustments to net assets.\" 2015-16 revenue and expense have been increased by $119 million to correct a consolidation adjustment eliminating those amounts at year-end, with no deficit impact. 2016-17 revenue and expense have been reduced by $111 million resulting from an accounting treatment change such that drug cost rebates under Product Listing Agreements are netted from operating expense instead of being reported as revenue and gross expense. b Reflects capital grants and other support included in expense, and capital investment in government-owned assets not included in expense. Capital investment adds to capital assets, which are depreciated over time through amortization expense. Numbers for 2008-09 to 2013-14 are estimates as details required to consolidate SUCH capital spending with full accuracy are not readily available. c The change in net assets year over year does not match the surplus / (deficit) exactly in most years, due to various balance sheet adjustments, most of which are minor. A significant adjustment reducing net assets by $2 billion was made in 2012-13, to recognize the accumulated deferred capital contribution liability when the accounting standard was adopted.157 May 2017 October 2017Fiscal Plan Response to the Auditor General158 RESPONSE TO THE AUDITOR GENERAL FISCAL PLAN 2018 - 21Table of Contents RESPONSE TO THE AUDITOR 2018 - 21 RESPONSE TO THE AUDITOR GENERAL The Auditor General reports on the scope and findings of the work carried out by the Office of the Auditor General .
