Particularly, light-based photo-thermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) showgreat application prospects in the prevention of wound infectionand promoting wound healing. In addition, hydrogels haveshown attractive advantages in the eld of wound dressings due to their excellent biochemical e ects. Therefore, multifunctional photoresponsive hydrogels (MPRHs) that integrate the advan-tages of light and hydrogels are increasingly used in biomedicine,especially in the eld of wound repair. However, a compre- hensive review of MPRHs for wound regeneration is still lacking.This review rst focuses on various types of MPRHs prepared by diverse photosensitizers, photothermal agents and small organic molecule-based PHDAs. We also then discuss how PTT, PDT, and photothermal/photodynamic synergistic therapy can modulate the microenvironments of bacteriato inhibit infection. Overall, multifunctional hydrogels with both therapeutic and tissue regeneration capabilities have beendiscussed and existing challenges, as well as future research directions in the eld of MPRHs and their application in wound management are argued. KEYWORDS: photosensitizers, photothermal agents, photodynamic agents, photoresponsive tissue regeneration, multifunctional hydrogels, antibacterial hydrogels INTRODUCTION Skin, the largest organ in the human body, plays an imperative role in the maintenance of biological homeostasis and protectingthe body from harmful materials and microbial invasion.1,2Once the skin is damaged or destroyed, the wound will undergo four o v e r l a p p i n gs t a g e st h a ti n c l u d eh e m o s t a s i s ,i n flammation, proliferation, and remodeling to heal.3Hemorrhage occurs immediately after tissue injury because of the rupture of bloodvessels.4Within a few minutes after the trauma, the aggregation of platelets and the formation of brin clots will produce hemostasis, and the wound healing process will quickly turn intothe in flammation stage. The cellular response in the inflammatory phase is mainly characterized by the flow of leukocytes into the wound area. Neutrophils (a kind of leukocyte) and monocytes are recruited by chemokines releasedin the process of hemostasis and by mast cells shortly after injuryand emigrate from capillaries to the wounded tissue. 5 Monocytes migrate to the tissue space and transform intomacrophages and in the later stage of in flammation, after the white blood cells leave, continue to remove debris and release chemokines (such as bronectin), attracting broblasts to the wound area to guide the healing process into the proliferationphase. The proliferative phase usually starts 2 days after injury. 4 Re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation,and collagen deposition are the main steps that constitute thisphase. The remodeling phase usually starts on the eighth dayafter the trauma. 6In fact, remodeling is also a clinically important stage. The production and decomposition of collagen Received: September 22, 2021 Accepted: November 20, 2022 at 13:08:46 (UTC).

In addition, the number ofcapillaries is also reduced and a few are transformed into smallarteries and veins. Some skin appendages, such as hair, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands regenerate at this stage. 4 Upon the creation of a defect or wound on the skin, a proper dressing would be needed to achieve rapid closure and healing ofthe injury. Although most of the skin defects can be healedwithin 1 or 2 weeks, 7infected skin wounds, especially full- thickness ones, usually result in severe pain, amputation, and even death.8In fact, bacterial infection is one of the most critical challenges in the wound healing process1,9,10since serious tissue damage can occur by microorganisms, resulting in severeinflammatory reactions and delayed wound repair.9,1114To prevent wound infections, antibiotics have been broadly used inthe clinic. However, their overuse/misuse has led to theemergence of multiple drug-resistant (MDR) strains, resultingin the generation of recalcitrant bio lms and chronic wounds. The formed bio lms can protect resident bacteria from external attacks and increase their resistance to antibiotics. 13,15,16This challenge needs an urgent attempt to develop technologies toaccelerate the healing of bacteria-infected wounds.15,1722 Compared to the traditional approaches, nanoparticles (NPs) have found tremendous application in wound healing andpreventing wound infections.17This is mainly due to the tunable physiochemical properties of NPs and the targeting ability of thenanosystems toward bacterial infective sites.23For example, NPs are featured by a high surface-to-volume ratio; therefore, the property can enhance their contact and interaction with microorganisms, thus leading to the activation of a broadrange of antimicrobial mechanisms and improving theirantimicrobial e cacy. 24Further, the antimicrobial activity of NPs can be in fluenced by other chemical physical parameters, including shape and surface modi cation.25Among the NP- based therapeutics, photoresponsive NPs due to their high bactericidal e ciency through local heating or controlled ROS productions in theinfected wound. 26 Light is a particularly appealing tool that has made a profound impact on modern medicine,27including drug delivery, photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT),and tissue engineering.28This is due to its ease of application, noninvasive nature, and spatiotemporal control.18,29Many studies have shown that local hyperthermia generated by PHTAs under light illumination at a speci c wavelength could induce the destruction of the bacterial integrity and provide on-demand drug release.30This has extensively been used in the treatment of bacteria-accompanied wounds.9,10,14,3133Under PTT, oxygenation can be promoted through increased bloodflow, which, in turn, boosts the healing process.28In addition, in the PDT, photosensitizers (PSs) combined with light andoxygen can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS),9,14,34 resulting in wound repair by combating infectious micro- organisms within the wound environment. Although great achievements have been realized by NP-based systems in thetreatment of infected wounds, the risk of unintended toxicity ofthe nanosystems and their negative e ect on the healing process still remains a big challenge; therefore, further investigationshould be devoted to addressing this ignored limitation. In thatsense, it is highly desirable to develop safe dressings in woundhealing while they carry a light-responsive property.Hydrogels are cross-linked three-dimensional polymer net- works that can absorb large amounts of water. 19,21This type of porous structure is commonly prepared by electrostaticinteractions/hydrogen bonding or covalent bonding betweentheir constituent polymer chains. Their degree of porosity,biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, andstability are tunable, 35providing excellent regenerative 3D networks to mimic native tissues. Moreover, injectable hydro-gels with adhesive properties have the potential to attach andbond the defected tissues together, thus prompting the woundto heal properly. Such dressings can also act as hemostatic agentsand prevent the leakage of fluids and gases from the wound area and serve as a sealant to maintain the wound from environ-mental bacterial infections. 33Moreover, various therapeutic agents, dyes, PHTAs, and PHDAs can be incorporated inside them to create outstanding candidates in diverse biomedical applications, including cancer therapy,3638drug delivery,39,40 and wound healing.22,39,41,42By combining the advantages of hydrogels and PDT/PTT, multifunctional photoresponsivehydrogels (MPRHs) are increasingly used in wound dressingto enhance wound healing. However, a comprehensive review ofMPRHs for wound healing acceleration is still lacking. In this review, we summarize an overview of the main recent achievements related to multifunctional MPRHs to treatwounds/infected wounds using irradiation ( Figure 1 ). We will focus on the MPRHs derived from diverse PHTAs and/or PHDAs and discuss how photoactive agents can modulate bacteria-infected micro-environments to kill the microorganisms. The impact of dierent components of MPRH on four phases of the wound healing process, i.e., hemostasis, in flammation, proliferation, and remodeling, will also be addressed. In addition, we will highlighttheragenerative hydrogels with both therapeutic and tissueregeneration capabilities. Finally, a brief perspective onchallenges and future research directions in this eld will be provided. Figure 1. Schematic representation of diverse PHTAs and PHDAs used in MPRHs a kind of arti cial increasing of tissue temperature with the contribution of PHTAs that can absorb light and convert itinto heat to cause the denaturation of protein, the cavitation and rupture of cells, the formation of bubbles, and the fragmentation of DNA, leading to the thermal ablation of the undesired cells at the target site to achieve a good therapeutic e ect. 4345Based onhigh inherent speci city and low invasive burden, PTT is an attractive and promising local heating approach46which can accelerate the blood flow in the wound area, while stimulating the proliferation of broblasts and reducing in flammation, thereby accelerating the wound healing process.4749 As a type of wound dressing, hydrogels, with a microstructure similar to the extracellular matrix, have an active role in woundhealing and provide a strategy for wound healing management Figure 2.

Photothermally Active Hydrogels Based on the Transition Metal Sul de/Oxide Nanomaterials. Wound healing is an interactive and complex process that requires the participation of a variety of cells, as well as the interactionbetween the extracellular matrix, cells, and other componentssuch as growth factors and chemokines. 53,54For example, in the early stage of wound healing, substances such as cytokines,brin, and coagulated blood mixture are required to cooperate to stabilize the wound. In addition, the immune cells recruited inthe wound area can secrete chemokines and growth factors,which help attract a variety of cells including broblasts and keratinocytes to migrate to the wound area, thereby guiding thehealing process to the proliferation phase. 2Moreover, angio- genesis plays an important role in the wound healing process because newly formed blood vessels can provide the trans-portation of nutrients and oxygen to the tissue.56Therefore, the promotion of angiogenesis is one of the most importantstrategies to promote the healing process.58 Existing studies have shown that Cu2+can stabilize the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors and activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) to enhance angiogenesis.54,59 Cu2+-loaded wound dressings have accelerated skin wound closure by the remodeling of extracellular matrix andupregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) in the wound area. Furthermore, the inherentantibacterial activity of Cu 2+reduces the risk of wound infection. Therefore, combining Cu2+and PTT synergistically endow the dressings with good antibacterial and tissue regenerationcapabilities. Studies have shown that CuS NP-loaded hydrogels have obvious killing e ects on Escherichia coli (E. coli )a n d Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus ), and the released Cu 2+could eectively stimulate angiogenesis was formed by the cross-linking of disul de bonds initiated by hydrogen peroxide oxidizing thiolated groups on thebackbone of HA. Based on the good biological activity of theCuS and HA, as well as the desirable NIR-responsiveperformance of the CuS, in vivo studies showed that animals that received CuS/HA hydrogel under NIR irradiation couldcreate smaller scars with less pigmentation and better recoverycompared to the other groups. Completely covered epithelium,more formation of new blood vessels, and enhanced collagendeposition in the group were con rmed through histology and immunohistochemistry staining. However, incorporation of CuS NPs into hydrogels through simple physical mixing makes it di cult to achieve controllable release of Cu 2+, and excessive local Cu2+accumulation may have a negative impact on wound healing, eventually leading to adelayed healing process.62Therefore, further surface function- alization of CuS NPs is expected to improve the stability of Cu2+ in hydrogels, thereby achieving a controlled release of Cu2+toexert a desired biological activity. For example, a NIR-responsive hydrogel composed of mesoporous in Figure 2B, CuS-loaded hydrogels possess small pores with circular morphology. After polymerization, the polymer solution wascompletely converted into a hydrogel, con rming the radical polymerization mechanism in the hydrogel formation catalyzedby APS/TEMED system ( Figure 2 C). The NIR-induced photothermal properties of the hydrogels were related to theconcentration of the CuS nanocomposites. In addition, repeatedNIR irradiation did not signi cantly a ect the photothermal behavior of the hydrogels. The nanocomposite hydrogel showed a triggered faster release rate of Cu 2+under NIR light irradiation because of the produced local heat under NIR irradiation.63 Moreover, the N-isopropylacrylamide-based hydrogel with the rapid thermal responsiveness could undergo volume conforma-tion changes by temperature alteration, thus leading to theaccelerated release of Cu 2+from the hydrogel, as well. Figure 2 D showed the antibacterial activity of the CuS-loaded hydrogelswith or without NIR illumination, and the results revealed thatthe enhanced antibacterial e cacy was observed in NIR- irradiated groups. In addition, the antibacterial e cacy of the corresponding hydrogels boosted signi cantly with the content of CuS increasing. In general, the same antibacterial trend wasobserved against E. coli . Such results highlighted the importance of concurrent ROS generation and hyperthermia stemmed fromthe CuS NPs responsible for the hydrogel 's antibacterial properties. The wound treated with CH4 (the hydrogelcontaining 1.5 mg mL 1CuS NPs) dressing hydrogels healed after treatment for 2 weeks, but clear defects persisted in the other groups ( Figure 2 E). In addition, the minimum amount of bacteria was observed in the CH4 group in vivo , as The photoresponsive couldstimulate angiogenesis and the proliferation of cells to acceleratethe process of wound healing. 63Nevertheless, the hydrogel prepared based on this strategy had poor injectability andrequired further treatment (such as dialysis) to removeunreacted monomers, which undoubtedly increased the complexity, thus limiting its facile bench to bedside transition. Therefore, the development of NIR-responsive CuS-basedhydrogels with good stability, taking into account goodinjectable behavior, can have great application prospects. In addition to the CuS as PHTAs for the preparation of NIR- responsive wound dressings, other transition metal oxides nanomaterials, including TiO 255and MnO2,56have been reported for the fabrication of this type of dressing hydrogels.For example, a black titania (B-TiO 2) NP-incorporated chitosan (CTS) matrix was prepared as a thermosensitive injectablesystem (abbreviated as BT-CTS thermogel).55Based on B- TiO 2's crystalline/amorphous core shell structure, the light absorption of the nanocrystals can be e ectively extended to the region of visible and NIR, indicating that the B-TiO 2-loaded hydrogel can convert light into heat under NIR irradiation. In addition, TiO2has been used as a PHDA to induce the generation of ROS under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Inaddition, the B-TiO 2NPs also had the ability to generate ROS when exposed to 808 nm irradiation. Such potential capabilitiesconferred the B-TiO 2NPs to simultaneously use in the treatment of skin-tumor-induced therapy and healing, whichwill be discussed in the next sections in detail. In study, covalent oxidative polymerization of ca eic-acid-functionalized CTS. The MnO 2 nanosheets with broad absorption in the NIR region ensured the good photothermal behavior of the hydrogel and could synergistically catalyze the of endogenousH alleviate between theMnO 2nanosheets and catechol, e.g., static electricity, , and polarinteractions, endowed the hydrogel with good mechanical behaviors, such as self-healing and injectability,which further broadened the application prospects of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) eect of the particles, which can turn NIR light into heat. 64For example, Tao et al.65reported Cu NPs NPs with citrate served as the reducing agent, and disul de- containing N,N-bis(acryloyl)cystamine (BACA) was added the double-bond-modi ed Cu NPs through the Cu S bonds. The hydrogel was formed by the free radical polymer-ization of Cu NPs (double-bond-modi ed) and methacrylated gelatin-containing of Cu NP-embedded hydrogels and PTT had broad-spectrumantibacterial activity against Gram-positive/negative bacteria,which could be attributed to the synergistic e ect of photo- thermal antibacterial properties of the hydrogels and theenhanced release of Cu 2+under the NIR laser irradiation Figure 3.

Copyright 2021 Elsevier.ACS (Figure 2 F).65First, the local temperature increased through exposure of Cu NP-loaded hydrogel under 808 nm to bacteria. Thereleased Cu 2+could increase the ROS generation and disturb the integrity of the bacterial membrane. The NIR-irradiatedhydrogels showed e ective wound closure, and the number of bacteria in the wound area was signi cantly reduced. Histological analysis also revealed the suppression of in flamma- tory responses and enhanced angiogenesis in the group thatreceived the Cu NP-embedded hydrogel with NIR irradiation(Figure 2 G,H). 65 Ag and Au NPs exhibit strong NIR absorbance due to the LSPR e ect similar to Cu NPs.65Therefore, the hydrogel wound dressings developed based on Ag and Au NPs show goodphotothermal behavior and exhibit great potential for treatingbacteria-infected wounds. To avoid wound infection caused bybacteria, the most common way is to incorporate antibiotics intothe dressings. Although various antibiotics are used, bacterialinfection is still one of the many problems that seriously a ect human health in the world and it is still challenging, and thewidespread application and abuse of antibiotics have further exacerbated the epidemic of antibiotic resistance. 67Therefore, the development of antibiotic-independent antibacterial wounddressings for the treatment of infected wounds is imminent. Among the existing antibacterial agents, Ag NP-based nanomaterials are the most common and well-studied types of antibacterial agents because of their wide antibacterial spectrum that can be e ective against a variety of Gram-positive/negative bacteria, fungi, and viruses.6871Ag NPs have been widely used clinically as antibacterial agents against a variety of micro-organisms, especially for burn wound management, which is dueto the good antibiotic-independent antibacterial properties ofAg NPs. However, the aggregation properties and oxidationof Ag NPs hinder its further antibacterial applications, andtherefore, the necessity of improving the stability of Ag NP hasincreased. 72A Ag NP-embedded hydrogel was reported for treating bacteria-infected wounds.66Gallic acid (GA) served as a green reducing agent to synthesize GA-Ag NPs that exhibitedphotothermal conversion e ciency (48.7%). In this system, GA- Ag NPs could act as PHTAs with the assistance of NIR radiation,causing thermal damage to bacteria to achieve good antibacterialproperties. The photothermal behavior of GA-Ag NPs, the prepared hydrogel exhibited excellent light-to-heat conversion behavior. After 10 min of NIR irradiation (power density: 1.5 W cm2), the maximum temperature of the core area of the hydrogel containing 200g/mL GA-Ag NPs increased from 17.2 to 49.9 \u00b0C. Bene from the excellent photothermal properties of GA-Ag NPs andthe inherent bactericidal +that released NPs, the bacteria-killing ratios against S. aureus andE. coliwere both higher than 94%. The morphological evaluation of S. aureus andE. coli conrmed that, with the assistance of NIR irradiation, the severe cell membrane was severely damaged and intracellular contents leaked after treatment with GA-Ag NP hydrogel. The GA-Ag NP hydrogels were placed on the backwound of the mouse, and after 2 min of NIR irradiation, it wasfound that the temperature of the wound area increased sharplyfrom 36.4 to 50.6 \u00b0C, which indicated that GA-Ag NP hydrogel had shown great application prospects as a PTT platform forwound healing applications. 66Further, by implementing S. aureus -infected wounds in a mouse full-thickness infectedwound model and continuously monitoring the wound area, it was found that the wound closure rate of GA-Ag NP hydrogelwas signi cantly faster than that of other treatment groups. Hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) staining of skin wound sectionsshowed weakened in ltration of in flammatory cells around the wound after GA-Ag NP hydrogel combined with NIR irradiation treatment. This might be attributed to the enhanced bactericidal activity of the GA-Ag NP hydrogel under the combinedtreatment to inhibit the in flammatory response, thereby accelerating the wound healing process. In general, the hydrogelprepared based on the above formula exhibited highantibacterial e ciency viathe release of Ag +, and the GA-Ag NP could serve as a PHTA to synergistically improve theantibacterial properties of the dressing.66 Au NPs are also widely used in the eld of biomedicine because of their chemical stability, biocompatibility, and highphotothermal conversion ( Figure 3 A). 76Au@PDA NRs were obtained through in situ polymerization of dopamine around the Au NRs in an alkaline solution. The core shell structure of the NRs was conrmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 3 B). Furthermore, the Au NR-loaded hydrogel with a relatively smooth surface and a porous structure was developedby thermally induced radical polymerization of N-acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA) Au NRs (termed asPNAGA-Au@PDA hydrogel). The prepared hydrogels coated with S. aureus orE. coli - pretreated macrophage membrane (named as S/EMMPNAGA-Au@PDA), where S and E represent the membranes ofmacrophages by treated S. aureus andE. coli and MM represents for macrophage membrane without any treatment. In vitro studies showed that the hydrogel coated with a pretreatedmacrophage membrane could speci cally recognize the source bacteria, and the bacteria-killing ratio reached 98% within 5 minof NIR irradiation. 76The bactericidal property was signi cantly higher than that of the hydrogels which did not coat with the macrophage membrane. Such behavior was attributed to thehydrogel coated with a pretreated macrophage membrane thatcan speci cally bind to the original bacteria and also the high photothermal e ect of the NIR-responsive hydrogels. The in vivophotothermal behavior of the Au@PDA-loaded hydrogel was evaluated by implanting the hydrogel into the subcutaneousarea on the rat dorsal area followed by the infrared thermalimaging under NIR irradiation. The area where the hydrogel wasimplanted had a color change and became brighter over time. In contrast, no signi cant color change was observed in the SMM- PNAGA, indicating that the hydrogel of this formula does nothave PHTA that can convert light into heat ( Figure 3 C). The therapeutic e ect of SMM-PNAG-Au@PDA hydrogel was further demonstrated in the S. aureus -infected wounds in a mouse full-thickness skin wound-infected model. SMM-PNAG- Au@PDA hydrogel showed a positive therapeutic e ect on bacteria-infected wounds because of its targeted photothermalantibacterial ability, leading to a faster wound closure rate andlower levels of neutrophils and white blood cells. H&E andMasson 's trichrome staining of the regenerated skin tissue sections indicated that regenerated tissue treated by SMM-PNAGA-Au@PDA+NIR possessed mature and completeepithelium and denser collagen ber deposition ( Figure 3D). 76This example highlighted the great potential platform for the treatment of bacteria-infected wounds. In addition to the above-mentioned metal nanostructures as PHTAs for preparing metal nanostructures, such as iron-,77palladium-,78or neodymium-based79composite materials have been reported for the preparation of NIR-responsive wound dressing hydrogels.For example, Phan et al. 78developed a CTS/poly(vinyl alcohol) Figure 4.

When the dressing was exposed to NIR irradiation(808 nm), they exhibited good photothermal behavior,stemming mainly from loaded palladium NPs that acted asPHTA to convert the light to heat. 78In another study, multifunctional neodymium calcium silicon bioglass compo- site hydrogels were prepared using simple mixing of thecomposites and alginic acid sodium salt.79The obtained hydrogel exhibited photothermal properties under NIRirradiation, and it can also emit fluorescence at the same time, and the intensity of fluorescence had a linear correlation with the in situ temperature.79These properties were attributed to the neodymium cations, which could generate thermal energy andemit infrared fluorescence under the NIR irradiation. This promising nding allows one to determine the optimal temperature in situ to completely kill the tumor without damaging the surrounding normal tissue during a PTT. Toconrm the regenerative property of the hydrogel, successful promotion in the healing of skin burn wounds was realized, aswell. Carbon-Based Photothermal Agents. The NIR-respon- sive hydrogel wound the goodphotothermal conversion ability of carbon-based nanostructuresto treat bacteria-infected wounds have been widely re-ported. 8083For example, a NIR-responsive hydrogel was reported for on-demand and local delivery of CO 2by combining the thermally responsive block copolymer of NP-modi ed with amino groups.84The carbon nanostructures could convert light into heat to trigger the decomposition of bicarbonate to produce CO2under NIR irradiation when the hydrogels were loaded with bicarbonate asa precursor for releasing CO 2. Therefore, such photoresponsive hydrogels could release CO 2locally over the wound bed to accelerate wound healing by improving local microcirculationobstacles and increasing the concentration of tissue oxygen. Inaddition, N-doped sponge-like carbon spheres were synthesizedby the pyrolysis of SiO 2/polyaniline, and it was shown that they exhibited a variety of enzyme mimicry activity, includingperoxidase, oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activity. Therefore, the sponge-like carbon spheres could not only generate heat after NIR irradiation but also generate a moreactive surface on the spheres, thereby improving its peroxidase-like activity, thereby generating more ROS to treat the bacteria-infected wound. Overall, the development of the above-mentioned carbon-based NIR active hydrogels show goodtherapeutic e ects on wound healing. CNTs with high electronic conductivity, small size, and large surface area can interact with biomolecules, cells, and evennatural tissues, thereby signi cantly enhancing the wound dressing 'sb i o l o g i c a la c t i v i t y . 85The strong NIR radiation absorbance of CNTs can also endow the dressing with greatpotential as a photothermal platform for the treatment ofwounds. 86,87For example, He et al. reported a photoresponsive CNT-based hydrogel wound dressing based on the stable photothermal and electronic properties of CNTs.88To avoid the integration of individual CNTs in water caused by the stronghydrophobic interaction, benzaldehyde-terminated PluronicF127 (PF127-CHO) was NIR-responsive hydrogels formedthrough a Schi base bond between the NH 2groups of N- carboxyethyl CTS and the CHO groups of the PF127-CHO, as well as the PF127 micelle physically cross-linked in a singlesystem ( Figure 4 A). It was shown that, with the addition of CNTs, the photothermal property of the hydrogels improvedsignicantly. The bacteria-killi ratio the hydrogels containing 2 mg/mL of CNTs was 100% against both S. aureus andE. coli after 10 min of 808 nm laser irradiation.88In the in vivo wound healing evaluation in a mouse full-thickness skin wound-infected model, enhanced wound closure healing,angiogenesis, and collagen deposition were observed. Giventhe above advantages as well as the simple preparation, thehydrogels were useful photothermal antibacterial hydrogels fortreating infected undergo controlled polymer- ization at subzero temperatures to introduce the interconnectedmacropores into the network of cryogels, which allows cells togrow into them easily, 8991and cryogels with interconnected macroporous structures allow water molecules to freely flow out/in of the network, which indicates that the free water in thecryogel can be extruded by physical pressing to obtain a shape-xed cryogel, and the xed cryogel could quickly restore its original shape by absorbing water, thereby showing water- triggered shape memory capability. 92Based on this character- istic, Zhao et al. developed an property,high blood absorption ability, rapid blood-triggered shapememory capability, and good blood-clotting ability, therebyshowing great potential in the eld of incompressible hemorrhage ( Figure 4 B). 93The presence of CNTs the hydrogels endowed them with good light-to-heat conversioncapability ( Figure 4 C). It was shown that the bacteria-killing ratio of the hydrogels against E. coli andS. aureus was about 95% after 1 min of NIR light irradiation. A 100% bacteria-killing ratioon the bacteria was obtained by extending the irradiation time to10 min ( Figure 4 D,E). Moreover, bene ting from the excellent water-triggered shape memory capability, it could be injected into the bleeding site in a xed shape and then restored to its original shape in an expanded geometry after contact with theblood. 93These properties exhibited the great potential of the cryogels as incompressible hemorrhage hemostasis dressing,which was further veri ed in the mouse-liver injury model, mouse tail amputation model, and in rabbit liver defect lethalnoncompressible hemorrhage model. The wound healingperformance of the conductive cryogels was studied as well byimplementing a full-thickness skin defect model. A faster wound closure rate was observed by the cryogels compared with the cryogels without CNTs ( Figure 4 F). The histomorphological evaluation con rmed that the wound in QCSG/CNT4 groups showed the least in flammatory in ltration among the treated groups on day 10. In addition, the vascularization in both CNT-free QCSG/CNT0 and QCSG/CNT4 (4 represents theconcentration of CNT as mg/mL) groups was higher than theTegaderm group on day 5 ( Figure 4 G). The improved wound healing performance of QCSG/CNT4 dressing over CNT-free QCSG/CNT0 dressing may be attributed to the transfer of electrosignals from the cryogel with conductivity to the woundsite, thereby increasing the level of growth factors involved in thewound area to accelerate the healing process e ectively. 94,95The above results revealed that the wound healing process could beimproved by cryogel through promoting vascularization.Further, the conductive QCSG/CNT4 was likely to furtheraccelerate the healing process by balancing in flammation inltration. 96The of responsive cryogels can serve as advanced and multifunctional materials for the emergency treatment of massive bleeding andthe development of e ective wound dressings. Existing investigations indicate that graphene may be better than other carbon nanomaterials (such as CNTs) because oftheir lower metal impurity content, and the puri cation process to remove the entrapped nanoparticles is less time-consuming. 97 Therefore, it is more widely used in the eld of biomedicine.98 The family of graphene-related nanostructures includes the structure or chemical derivatives of graphene, e.g., several layers of graphene, flake stacks of graphene layers, graphene oxide (GO), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO).98The lateral size of this 2D material ranges from 10 nm to 20 m. A series of biomaterials based on the biocompatibility, high surface area,mechanical strength, and excellent electrical conductivity of graphene have been developed. 33,99101In this section, we will select some representative works to focus on graphene-basedconductive NIR-responsive hydrogel wound dressings and theirapplication prospects in the eld of wound healing. Recently, Liang et al. reported a type of GO-incorporated hydrogel. In the study, double-bond-modi ed QCSG ( Figure 5A) and methacrylated gelatin (GM) were rst synthesized (Figure 5 B). 101Next, the hydrogel was prepared through the radical polymerization of GM and QCSG (named as QCSG/GM). Furthermore, the QCSG/GM/GO hydrogel washarvested with the incorporation of GO through electrostatic interaction. The excellent properties of each matrix could synergistically impart multiple functions to the hydrogels, suchas photothermal and antibacterial properties by the GO andQCSG, respectively ( Figure 5 C). Furthermore, the actual therapeutic e ect of QCSG/GM/GO sample was successfully veried by implementing the methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)-infected wounds in a mouse full-thickness skin wound- infected model. 101 Although GO with hydrophilic groups ( e.g., hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyl groups) exhibits a better water dispersibility, itsconductivity is much lower than that of graphene.98To address this issue, rGO-based hydrogel with enhanced the study, rst, graft-dopamine (HA-DA) polymer was prepared through an amidation reaction(Figure 5 D). In addition, dopamine was used as a reducing agent to prepare rGO with enhanced conductivity. Dopamine was self- polymerized at the same time to form a hydrophilic PDA coatingon the surface of rGO to improve rGO 's dispersion ( Figure 5 E). Subsequently, rGO loaded into the HA-DA and H 2O2/HPR (horseradish peroxidase) were used as a catalytic system toinduce gelation mediated by the oxidized catechol groups of PDA. gelation produced adhesive hemostatic, conductive, and injectable composite hydrogels for wound healing applications Figure 5 F). 33Compared to rGO@PDA-free hydrogels, the \u00d710 4to 2.5 \u00d7104Sm1after incorporation of rGO@PDA. It was shown that the enhanced conductivity of the hydrogel sca olds was bene cial for the transmission of electrical signals from living biological tissues and promoted the wound healing process. When the hydrogels were exposed to NIR irradiation, Tincreased from 11.3 to 14.5 and 17 \u00b0C, as the content of rGO@PDA increased from 0.1 to 0.3 and 0.5 mg/mL, thus con rming that the good photothermal performance of the hydrogel originated from rGO@PDA.Subsequently, the NIR-responsive properties in signi cantly increased under 808 nm irradiation for 1 min. The results showed that the bacterial survival ratio of E. coli was 64.1% and S. aureus was 65.4%, and the killing ratio could almost reach 100% for theabove two bacteria when the irradiation time was extended to 10 min. 33After a mouse full-thickness skin wound model was created, the histology and immunohistochemistry studiesconrmed that the multifunctional hydrogels containing 3 wt % of the rGO@PDA exhibited better promotion e ect in the healing process by enhancing the thickness of granulation tissue,the deposition of collagen, and simultaneously upregulating Figure 5.

Some conjugated polymers with the system such as ythiophene), NIR-responsive of antioxidant, used as an oxidant to initiate the polymerization of dopamine in a precooled CTS polymer solution. The oxidized dopamine could react with the amino group of CTS or itself, and then the network of the dressing was constructed by the physical assembly of dopamine oligomers and covalent bonds ( Figure 6A1,A2).105The resulting macroporous cryogels showed adjust- able and high volume expansion ratio, fast blood-sucking expansion, excellent photothermal behavior, and tunable mechanical strength, thereby endowing the hydrogels a greatapplication prospect in hemostasis and wound healing application.105In addition, when the cryogels were exposed to NIR irradiation, the CTS sponge (the cryogels with 0 mg/mL PDA) showed a slight temperature increase after 10 min of NIR irradiation (1.4 W/cm2). For the cryogels with PDA content increased from 1.5 to 7.5 mg/mL, the equilibrium Tgradually increased from 10 to 19 \u00b0C. In addition, the cryogels possessed good antibacterial properties under NIR light irradiation, causing denaturation of enzymes and destruction of lipids and proteins on cell membranes. The bacteria-killing ratio increasedconsiderably from 30.2 to 89.2% and 30.4 to 87.0% for the S. aureus andE. coli , respectively, only 1 min of NIR irradiation. By further extending the irradiation time to 10 min, both E. coli and S. aureus were completely killed. 105In addition, the incorporated PDA inside the framework endowed the cryogels with adhesive property and positive bindi ng sites, thus inducing the aggregation of blood cells and the adhesion and activation of platelets. The in vivo wound healing results revealed the cryogels could induce balanced in flammatory in ltration in the early stage of wound healing, promoted vascularization and recruiting Figure 6.

In glycidyl methacrylate functionalized of the quaternized CTS solutioncontaining PB B 1,B2).10A number amines hydroxyl groups in the quaternized CTS copolymer and alsothe presence of PB NPs in the hydrogel framework improved themechanical strength of these hydrogels through the electrostaticattractions and the abundant hydrogen bonds. It was shown thatthe PB-loaded hydrogels exhibited excellent photothermal performance under NIR light irradiation, and the antibacterial ratio of the hydrogels against both S. aureus andE. coli was more than 99% after 20 min of NIR irradiation (0.3 W/cm 2). This performance was related to the hyperthermia produced duringthe antibacterial tests, which destroyed the bacterial membraneand subsequently denatured the proteins on the cell membranesof bacteria, thereby e ectively killing the bacteria. 10 Iron(III) catechol complexes or acid complexes with good biocompatibility, biodegradability, andecient photothermal conversion properties have shown great potential to develop NIR-re sponsive dressing hydro- gels.57,111114In a recently published study, was used for of the hydrogel wound dressings based on a Schi base reaction between the amino group of the QCS and the aldehyde group of the protocatechualdehyde (PA) as well as the coordination of Feand the aldehyde group are shown in Figure 7 A 1,A2. It is worth mentioning that hydrogels avoid complex synthesis ormodication during the synthesis process, so the preparation process was simple, and the hydrogel exhibited a variety ofbiological functions, such as adhesive, antibacterial, andantioxidant properties ( Figure 7 A 3). When the hydrogels were irradiated by NIR, the temperature of the hydrogels reached 45\u00b0C. There was almost no temperature increase in pure QCS, as well ( Figure 7 B), thus such hyperthermia stemmed from the iron(III) catechol complex cross-linked QCS. The e ective in vivo antibacterial properties.115As shown in Figure 7 C, no obvious bacterial reduction was shown in the control group withor without NIR intervention and in the hydrogel treatmentgroup without NIR irradiation. In contrast, the number ofbacteria in the hydrogel with the NIR irradiation treatmentgroup was signi cantly reduced. Subsequent wound healing results showed that although the wounds of the experimental groups were almost completely healed after 3 weeks, the actualtreatment e ect of the hydrogel with NIR irradiation group was signicantly better than that of the other groups ( Figure 7 D). Such a nding was speci cally manifested by H&E staining as more broblast migration and less in flammatory cell in ltration, more blood vessels, and hair follicle regeneration ( Figure 7 E). The good wound healing ability of the hydrogel was mainlyattributed to the inherent antibacterial activity of QCS protocatechualdehyde, near-infrared-assisted enhance the antibacterial ability ofthe dressing. 115In another study, a physical double network removable hydrogel with high healing e ciency and NIR- responsive antibacterial properties was reported.57The hydrogel was prepared based on quadruple hydrogen bonding cross-linked co-poly- (ethylene glycol)- g-catechol. The heat maps after 10 min of NIR irradiation con rmed that the temperature of the hydrogel group containing the catechol Fe3+complex increased signicantly. The achievement con rmed that the hydrogels had good photothermal properties based on the e cient NIR absorption and thermal conversion e ect of coordinated catechol Fe3+. It is worth mentioning that the fluidity of the hydrogel network gradually increased after NIR irradiation, thusshowing NIR irradiation-assisted removability, which undoubt-edly simpli ed the noninvasive replacement of the dressings in wound healing applications. This feature was mainly attributedto the temperature sensitivity of the coordination and hydrogenbonding in the hydrogel network. In fact, when the hydrogel wasexposed to NIR irradiation, the degree of cross-linking ofcoordination and hydrogen bonding weakened because of thetemperature increase, thus resulting in a weakening in thestiness of the hydrogels. PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY PDT is a minimally invasive strategy that utilizes light- responsive PSs with appropriate excitation sources to generateROS. The produced ROS can damage surrounding biomole-cules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids through anoxidation process, thus killing pathogenic microorganisms. 15,116 Depending on the ROS formed, PDT is classi ed into two mechanisms, i.e., type I and type II ( Figure 8 ). The PSs utilized in PDT are normally in a ground electronic singlet state (1PS0) and become excited to a short-lived singlet state (1PS*) after irradiation with a certain wavelength of light. The electron rst reaches the long-lived ( 102) triplet state (3PS*) through a well-known process called intersystem crossing.28The3PS* directly transfers one electron to the adjacent substratesincluding the cell membrane, lipid, protein, or even other PSmolecules to generate free radicals or radical ions, such as \u0081O2 and\u0081OH (type I mechanism). In the type II mechanism, molecular oxygen can be directly converted into singlet oxygen 1O2by3PS*through energy transfer to e ectively kill bacteria (Figure 8 ).15Commonly, PSs are classi ed into two categories, i.e., organic and inorganic PSs. Organic PSs mainly include Figure n dots (GQDs) include in the inorganic- based PSs.15For example, it has been shown that GQDs boosted the acceleration of the wound healing process by promoting Figure 9.

Taking the excellent advantagesof hydrogels in wound healing applications, the development ofeective PS-loaded hydrogels with potent bactericidal and healing properties is of paramount importance especially thewounds after surgical intervention. 124129In addition, severe tissue damage can occur after wound infection by micro- organisms especially S. aureus bacteria followed by in flammatory reactions. Therefore, accelerated wound treatment usingeective antimicrobial wound dressings to minimize bacterial infections has recently gained much attention.9,11,14,96In the following section, we will focus on the recent developments ofPS-loaded hydrogels based on the type of PS-incorporatedhydrogels for the healing of infected wounds. ZnO-Based Photodynamic Hydrogels. Due to the production of ROS by ZnO nanomaterials, they have beenwidely used as excellent antimicrobial agents. 130132In addition, Zn2+released from such nanosystems can stimulate the production of broblasts and immune cells, which play a crucial role during skin regeneration.133,134Given the rapid recombi- nation of charge carriers and the low charge separation eciency, pure ZnO NPs usually show relatively low light to energy conversion e ciency. To circumvent this de ciency, Ag/ Ag@AgCl/ZnO hybrid nanostructures embedded withincarboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) hydrogels were used to promptthe wound healing process. 14In fact, the Ag/Ag@AgCl nanosystem NP-coated (indicated as Ag/Ag@AgCl) had cube-like morphology, as con rmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. It was shown that one-dimensional ZnO nanorods were detectable on the Ag/Ag@AgCl nanostructures after ZnO doping (named as Ag/Ag@AgCl/ZnO). The swelling shrinking performance of the multifunctional hydrogels showed that hydrogels were pH-sensitive and had a diameter in the neutral condition that waslarger than that in the acidic environment. This behavior isrelated to the protonation of the carboxylate groups of CMC atthe pH 2. Zn 2+release from the nanocomposite hydrogels was also pH-dependent with a much larger release in the acidic environment. The same trend of Ag+release was observed from the Ag-containing hydrogels.14Antibacterial activity of the photoactive hydrogels against E. coli andS. aureus was assessed by TEM analysis. Di erent degrees of cell wall damage and loss of intracellular substrates were detected due to the penetrationof Zn 2+and Ag+into the bacteria. After irradiation for 5 min with simulated sunlight, electron spin resonance (ESR) studiesshowed that the generation of singlet oxygen hydrogel cantly higher than that of the pure ZnO hydrogel. This indicated that the deposition of Ag/Ag@AgCl on ZnO nanostructures could boost the photoactivity of ZnO, thus increasing the production of ROS ( Figure 9 B). As shown in Figure 9 C,D, the Ag/Ag@AgCl nanocomposite enhanced the antibacterial activity of ZnO against both E. coli andS. aureus upon exposure to simulated visible light. ROS generation is proposed to be the dominant antibacterial mechanism, as conrmed by the ESR results.14In vivo assessments on a wound model showed signi cant healing in a 14-day period when Ag/ Ag@AgCl/ZnO and ZnO hydrogels were used as wound dressings, while poor healing was observed for the CMC and Ag/Ag@AgCl hydrogel groups . The immunohistological imaging of the skin showed many neutrophils (red arrows) accumulated in the defect site of the all groups after 2 daytreatment, indicating stimulation of the immune system to produce immune cells to ght against the infection caused by S. aureus bacteria ( Figure 9 E). The loss of connective tissues (red rectangles) and abundant dead cell debris (black arrows) were observed in the control, Ag/Ag@AgCl, and group with ZnO(Figure 9 E). In contrast, an enhanced number of newborn blood vessels (blue arrows) and dermal broblasts (green arrows) were observed in the Ag/Ag@AgCl/ZnO treated group on day 4 (Figure 9 E). The observation was related to Zn 2+release, which stimulated the production of broblasts. Compared to other groups, signi cant increased connective tissue (black rectangles) was detected in the Ag/Ag@AgCl/ZnO group on day 8 ( Figure 9E). The appearance of infected necrotic foci (cyan rectangles) in groups H1 and H2 on day 14 ( Figure 9 E) demonstrated the excellent therapeutic ability of the Ag/Ag@AgCl/ZnO-embedded hydrogel in wound healing.14This study clearly showed how photodynamic therapy and synergistic antibacterial eects stemming from the release of Ag+and Zn2+, and consequently, stimulation of the immune system can help to design and fabricate advanced hydrogels to treat infected wounds. Black Phosphorus-Based Photodynamic Hydrogels. C 3N4,1372D clay materials,138and MXenes,139exhibiting optical, electrical, and thermal properties has gained huge attention in biomedical applications.140145 Among them, black phosphorus (BP) exhibits tunable band gap and excellent biocompatibility.107In addition, BP, as a semiconductor, possesses a thickness-dependent band gap ranging from about 0.3 eV for bulk to 2.0 eV for a single layer, allowing them to absorb a broad range of light in the visible region. Therefore, this property enabled the few-layer BPs to produce1O2, acting as a photosensitizer in PDT applications. Recently, the use of BP-embedded chitosan hydrogels (BP@ CS) for PDT of infected wounds viaaccelerating regenerative activities of the skin cells and eradicating of bacteria through the 1O2generation under visible light irradiation was introduced.9 Using ESR analysis,1O2generation by BP@CS hydrogel during visible light illumination was con rmed by a three-lines- spectrum containing relative intensities of 1:1:1 ( Figure 10 A). This property endowed the hydrogels with signi cant antibacterial e cacy (99.51% against S. aureus and 98.90% against E. coli ), attributed to the rapid ROS production from the BPs under the light irradiation ( Figure 10 B).In vitro cytotoxicity of BP@CS hydrogel on NIH-3T3 cells showed that the cells could proliferate after 3 and 7 days of coculture, demonstratingACS of the hydrogels. Increased expression of-actin was observed in the cells exposed to BP@CS hydrogel, thus enhancing broblast proliferation and di erentiation into myobroblasts. In addition, t he hydrogels enhanced the expression of collagen type III in the growth of the NIH-3T3 cell, which is crucial for basement membrane regeneration andgranulation tissue reorganization during wound healing process.9After treatment for 14 days, the CS-BP group was signicantly healed under the light illumination. This fact demonstrated rapid sterilization created by1O2generation stemming from BPs in the presence of light during the wound healing process. In addition, abundant in flammatory cells were Figure 11. (A) Schematic preparation of Ag/TiO2-incorporated hydrogel and its application in the treatment of infected wound healing.

After the 14 days oftreatment, cell vacuolization of each skin layer was observed in the control, CS, and 3M wound dressing groups (at both dark Figure 12.

In contrast, under light irradiation, the CS-BP group exhibited normal tissues without any in flammatory cells, cell vacuolization, and monolayer keratinocytes ( Figure 10 C). As demonstrated by Giemsa staining, signi cant bacteria appeared in the control group, 3M wound dressing (both dark and light), and CS-BP group (at dark) after 2 days of treatment (greenarrows) ( Figure 10 C). Interestingly, infection or bacteria completely disappeared in the CS-BP + light treatment group. Using Western blot analysis, it demonstrated that CS-BP treatments could trigger signaling pathways of phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),and ERK, thus resulting in broblast proliferation and dierentiation ( Figure 10 signi cantly enhanced the formation to the other groups; thus, the synergistic e ects accelerated wound healing and 2-Based Photodynamic Hydrogels. TiO 2has exten- sively been used as a PDT agent with excellent killing activity against pathogens in the ultraviolet wavelength range.17,147 However, it su ers from a weak antibacterial e ect in the visible area, which can be improved by doping small amounts of Ag in TiO 2viathe improvement of ROS generation in the visible area as well as decreasing the toxicity through the reduced release of Ag ions by TiO 2.148,149In a study, Ag/TiO 2NP-incorporated poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel was used for the promotion of infected wound healing through light-irradiated ROS generation.150First, Ag/TiO 2NPs were synthesized viaa chemical reduction process, and then the photoresponsive hydrogel was prepared by dispersion of the TiO 2nano- composites in PVA followed by freeze thaw cycles ve times (Figure 11 A).Figure 11 B represents the electron microscopy images of the uniform Ag/TiO 2NPs with an average diameter of less than 100 nm and Ag and Ag2O doping on TiO2. Ag/TiO2- incorporated hydrogels showed interconnected porous struc-tures with 1 to 3 m pore size, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping con rmed the homogeneous distribution of the Ag on the surface of TiO 2. As an important criterion for wound healing acceleration, the Ag/TiO2-incorporated PVA hydrogel exhibited favorable water adsorption capacity. Thehybrid hydrogel (HD) showed no antibacterial activity with and without light irradiation within 5 min. In addition, the release of Ag +from Ag/TiO 2-incorporated was not enough to reach the minimum threshold of antibacterial e ect within 5 min under visible light (VL). In contrast, the antibacterial activity of HDunder 606 VL irradiation was Ag concentration-dependent and signicantly killed bacteria in a short time ( Figure 11 C). The bacterial killing of the 0.5% Ag/TiO 2HD was due to the induction of cell wall damage of bacteria due to the generation of 1O2and\u0081OH, while pure hydrogel and TiO 2HD did not show such impact. The Ag/TiO2-incorporated hydrogel exhibited good cytocompatibility; however, with increasing the amount ofAg up to 1%, slight cytotoxicity was observed.150In addition, the assay showed a signi cantly lower amount of lymphocyte accumulation (red arrow) in the wound area of animals treated with 0.5% HD as compared with control, 3M wound dressing, and TiO 2HD groups ( Figure 11 D). H&E staining of the soft tissues surrounding the wounds showed that numerous lymphocytes (indicated by red arrow) could beobserved in the control, 3M, and TiO 2HD groups after 2 days of treatment, which is the characteristics of tissue infection ( Figure 11E). In addition, Giemsa staining con rmed this type of infection within the infected tissue. In contrast, the number oflymphocytes in the tissues treated by Ag/TiO 2-incorporated hydrogel was decreased obviously compared to that of the othergroups. After 14 days of the treatment, there were fewlymphocytes in all groups because of the eradication of allbacteria by the immune system. In addition, compared to other groups, a low number of necrotic areas (indicated by the orange arrow) was observed in the tissues treated by Ag/TiO 2- decorated hydrogel. This fact con rmed the photoactive hydrogel could rapidly kill bacteria to maintain the tissue fromdestruction by bacteria. Small Organic Molecule-Based Photodynamic Hydro- gels. Sinoporphyrin sodium (DVDMS) singlet oxygen ( 1O2) yield, antibacterial property, and fluorescence imaging ability. Like most organic PSs, it is not su ciently stable under physiological conditions, thus limiting its photodynamic activity.151153In 2020, the DVDMS-incorporated carboxymethyl CTS (CMCS)-sodiumalginate (CS) hydrogel was used to increase the photoactivity ofDVDMS. Such incorporation boosted the photodynamic antibacterial e ect of the PS under mild illumination (30 J/ cm 2,5m i loaded within the hydrogels to improve re-epithelization, angiogenesis, and collagen synthesis during burninfections healing. The DVDMS and bFGF-loaded hydrogel(CSDP hydrogel) was prepared by the reaction of CS and SAunder the catalysis of 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide ( Figure 12 A). It was found that the catalytic system decreased the gelation time, improved rheological properties, and increased the tensilestrength of the hydrogel through amide bond formation betweenCMCS units. Similar to CS hydrogel, SEM images showed thatthe CSDP hydrogel had an interconnected porous structure.The release of DVDMS from the hydrogels at pH 6.8 was muchhigher than pH 7.4. pH value in wound areas ( 6.8) is lower than the physiological environment of the adjacent tissues (7.4). The pH-controlled release property enhanced the accumulation of DVDMS in the infected wound and promptedthe photodynamic antibacterial property of the hydrogel ( Figure 12B). Such bactericidal behavior was obtained through ROS production under mild irradiation (5 min, 30 J/cm 2) against S. aureus and MDR- S. aureus in vitro .34The CSDP showed excellent hemostatic performance in a hemorrhaging mouse-liver model ( Figure 12 C). This performance is attributed to the CTS chains, which could bind to the negatively charged membranes of platelets and erythrocytes.154SEM images demonstrated that S. aureus and MDR- S. aureus treated with CS, DVDMS, and CSDP in the absence of 30 J/cm2light were largely una ected ( Figure 12 D). In contrast, under photo- dynamic conditions and exposure to light, the bio lm network was highly weakened and single bacterial colonies appeared.These results con rmed the antibio lm property of the con rmed by SYTO 9/PI staining, showing an increased relative proportion of dead cells in the CSDP plus light group (Figure 12 E). 34In vivo wound healing studies proved that compared with 57.37, 79.55, and 83.37% wound closure in freeDVDMS, DVDMS-hydrogel (CSD), and the control group,respectively, quantitative wound closure in the group of CSDPunder the light irradiation was 100%. Such excellent perform-ance of the hydrogel was related to antimicrobial e ects, high water content, as well as bFGF release from hydrogels 15, wound healing process. Hierarchical structures of dermis and epidermis were also observed in the CSD and CSDP groups under the light illumination (indicated as blue and red arrows)and con rmed by H&E staining of the excised skin tissues 21 days post-treatments ( Figure 12 F).

Copyright 2019 Wiley-VCH.ACS Nano www.acsnano.org Review https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c08334 ACS Nano 2021, 15, 18895 1893018914 Western blot proved higher protein expression levels in the selected protein for the wound-healing e ects. In fact, in the presence of laser irradiation (4 J/cm2, power = 100 mW), the hydrogel inhibited in flammation, as well as induced cell proliferation and di erentiation could improve the wound healing process. Using immunohistochemistry studies, it was clearly found that the laser-treated group boosted EGFR and TGF- 1 markers, which were a good indication of broblast cells in the dermis layer and collagen deposition, respectively.Although promising, antimicrobial investigations of the hydro-gel were lacking, which are indispensable studies in the healingprocess. As known, most of the organic PSs are not stable in physiological conditions, thus limiting their e ect as PHDA in biomedical applications. 156,157In comparison with traditional PSs, organic luminogens with aggregation-induced emission(AIE) characteristics showed aggregation boosted ROSgeneration property, thus con rming their potential applications in PDT. 157159Luminogens with AIE characteristics (AIEgens) usually exhibit bright fluorescence in the aggregate or solid state.160In fact, AIEgens ( e.g., tetraphenylsilole161or tetraphe- nylethane162) in the molecular state exhibited negligible fluorescence due to quenching of the excited state viamotions of rotatable or vibratile moieties of the AIEgens. In contrast, inthe aggregate state, all of the motions are restricted due to shortintermolecular distance among the twisted structures, thusprotecting excitons from nonradiative decay, endowing thespecic structures with enhanced fluorescence. 163It should be added that molecules with AIE characteristics often have apropeller-like con guration.160,161Therefore, the restriction of intramolecular motions is the main mechanism of AIE property.163,164In addition, it is promising to develop AIE PSs which can be used to produce ROS e ectively from the aggregate state.165,166One important strategy to produce aggregated state is to incorporate electron-accepting andelectron-donating moieties into two compounds of AIEgens.160 Berberine chloride (BBR) exhibited AIE characteristics generating ROS under white light irradiation.167In a study, a hybrid hydrogel with AIE performance was constructed throughthe BBR NP-incorporated hydrogel with PDT of infected ( Figure 13A). 168TEM images of BBR-decorated of 10.9 \u00b12.3 nm in size ( Figure 13 B). Due to AIE behavior and1O2generation of the hydrogels under white light irradiation, promising antibacterial and antibio lm activity against both S. aureus andE. coli bacteria were realized by the PDT pathway. In addition, excellent healing was observed by thephotoresponsive Fmoc-F/BBR hydrogels on infected wounds in antibacterial activity of Fmoc-F/BBR and Fmoc-F/BBR+NIR in the skin wound showed that the number of bacteria in Fmoc-F/BBR+NIR group was signi - cantly lower than those of in other groups. Compared to the ratstreated by the hydrogels the group receiving white light, thenumber of bacterial colonies was less than the group treatedunder dark condition, con rming the important role of the light illumination on the killing of S. aureus . In addition, after 1 day, there was almost no colony in the spleen and liver of the grouptreated by PDT, suggesting phototherapy as potent therapy toinhibit internal bacterial infections ( Figure 13 D). 168H&E- stained images on day 7 exhibited some congestion in thecontrol group, while the other groups showed new broblast proliferation and collagen formation in the wound area ( Figure 13E). In addition, similar to normal skin tissue, newly generated vessels were observed in the Fmoc-F/BBR+NIR group,conrming that the Fmoc-F/BBR hydrogel had e cient photodynamic antibacterial property to eliminate bacteria inthe infected wounds under white light irradiation. PHOTOTHERMAL/PHOTODYNAMIC SYNERGISTIC THERAPY Phototherapy systems, including PDT and PTT, have attracted wide attention for tissue disinfection due to their controllability,penetrability, and excellent antibacterial activities.14,169171 However, through a single PTT, a higher temperature is required to achieve e ective antibacterial killing, thus may cause serious side e ects to normal tissues.172,173On the other hand, for PDT, abundant ROS is needed to kill most bacteria through asingle PDT. Therefore, excessive ROS may be dangerous tonormal tissues during PDT, including in flammation, brosis, and even necrosis. 132,174178Therefore, it is highly essential to develop alternative strategies to employ photothermal/photo- dynamic synergistic therapy (PTDT) for rapid disinfection, i.e., moderate PDT with limited ROS and PTT with lowertemperature during the infected wound healing process. Infact, the PTDT improves the bacterial membrane permeabilityviaincreased local heat, then the generated ROS through PDT route can easily permeate the bacteria cell wall to oxidizeintracellular proteins and disrupt bacterial homeostasis. 135,179In the following section, we describe recent studies of PTDT,fabricated by a combination of diverse PHTA and PHDA asplatforms for wound healing applications under appropriatelight illumination. Classi cation of the PTDT will be type of PHTA used. Polydopamine-Based Phot othermal/Photodynamic Synergistic Therapy. Because of its broad absorption from the visible to NIR wavelengths (300 1000 nm), PDA exhibits an excellent photothermal property. 180In a study, synergistic eects of both PDT PTT carbon ZnO wound was investi-gated. 181DFT-hydrogel was prepared by gelation of PDA and FA through their cross-linking by Zn2+ions ( Figure 14 A). The porous structure of DFT-hydrogel with a diameter of 50 60m is shown by SEM ( Figure 14 B). Rheological analysis of the hydrogels showed that storage modulus was uniformly higherthan loss modulus, revealing that the hydrogels were stable andexhibited good mechanical properties. Due to the presence ofPDA and C/ZnO quantum dots within acting as PHTAs, thenal temperature of the DFT-C/ZnO-hydrogel could increase to 55 \u00b0C upon irradiation with both 808 and 660 nm light, which was higher than the DFT-hydrogel containing single PHTA(Figure 14 C). 181Under the coirradiations, the DFT-hydrogel was unable to generate ROS, while DFT-C/ZnO-hydrogel could produce a large amount of ROS, demonstrating that C/ ZnO served as a strong photocatalyst in the hydrogels ( Figure 14D). Mechanistically, the CQDs are able to convert light with a long wavelength ( 600 nm) to short-wavelength light (<400 nm), leading to the photoexcitation of ZnO and the generationof electron hole pairs, thus producing ROS ( Figure 14 E). It was shown that antibacterial e cacy of the under dual-light irradiation against both E. coli andS. aureus was 99.9%, revealing that C/ZnO could endow the DFT-hydrogel with high photothermal and photodynamic performance upon the 808 and 660 nm irradiation ( Figures 14 F and G). In contrast, without light, there was no signi cant bacteria-killing e ect compared to the control group. This was mainly stemmed fromsynergistic e ects of the generated ROS, increased local heat as well as the release of Zn 2+. Such e ects caused the destruction of the bacteria cellular membrane, and thus disruption of bacterialmetabolism and damage of intracellular proteins, consequently fullling a bacteria-killing property e ciently.181The quantita- tive wound closure rates in the in vivo wound healing for the DFT-C/ZnO-hydrogel, DFT-hydrogel, 3M wound dressing, and control groups were 59.8, 50.7, 48.2, and 35.8%, respectively. This evidence indicated the excellent performanceof the DFT-C/ZnO-hydrogel as a wound dressing ( Figure 14H). As shown in H&E images, a large number of in flammatory cells (red arrows) could be found in the control and 3M wound Figure 15.

Compared to other groups, the DFT-C/ZnO-hydrogel group with dual light irradiationexhibited a few erythrocytes in the 2 day and 5 day groupsand complete epidermal structure (indicated as yellow arrows).In addition, after 10 days, intact skin (indicated by a blue arrow)and normal subcutaneous tissue structure (indicated as greenarrows) could be observed in the group. 181Collectively, such excellent property of the all-in-one photoresponsive hydrogelshows a positive e ect in the design and fabrication of advanced photodriven hydrogels in accelerated wound healing and tissue reconstruction. The e ective and rapid antibacterial performance was realized by the combination of PDA and Ag@AgCl NPs as PTT andPDA, respectively, to generate mild conditions, i.e., lower temperature (50 \u00b0C) and limited ROS under single visible light irradiation through the PTDT. 173Polyacrylamide as polymer was used to prepare PDA and Ag@AgCl-embedded hydrogels. Investigation on the bacterially infected wounds in vitro andin vivoshowed that severe leakage of protein from the bacteria ( i.e., S. aureus andE. coli ), which was responsible for the antibacterial activity, occurred under the PTDT. It demonstrated that the interruption of the outer and inner membrane bacterial by heatand ROS could disrupt bacteria hemostasis. The phenomenon facilitated the entering of ROS into the bacteria, ultimately, leading to a bacteria-killing e ect. This study highlighted how the understanding of the antibacterial mechanism, particularly Figure 16.

MoS 2-Based Photothermal/Photodynamic Synergistic Therapy. MoS2nanosheets, as one of the most representative and explored 2D transition metal dichalcogenides with an abundant precursor in nature, have gained a lot of interest in biomedicine applications.182The nanosheets are extensively used in PTT of cancer and infection.20,183186Ag3PO4as a potent photocatalyst could produce a large amount of ROS, thus killing bacteria during light irradiation.177,187,188Due to the promotion of the charge separation and the transfer of photon- generated electrons of Ag3PO4to MoS2, ( i.e.,A g 3PO 4/MoS 2) could act as a stronger photocatalyst, thus endowing it with enhanced photochemical ROS generation capability for improving the antibacterial activity. In addition, the toxicity of the Ag+could be reduced by adsorption Ag+on the surface of MoS 2nanosheets. In 2019, PVA hydrogel (named 3PO 4/ MoS 2HD) constructed for e cient wound healing based on thecombination of PDT and PTT under dual light irradiation (660 and 808 nm) ( Figure 15 A).31In vitro studies showed that, compared to 660 nm visible light or 808 nm NIR light irradiation alone, the hydrogel exhibited more ROS production due to better electrical conductivity and heat generation under the duallight irradiation. 31The behavior displayed in antibacterial property of the photoresponsive hydrogels against S. aureus bacteria, by SEM morphology of viable bacteria and colony-forming unit images ( Figure 15 B). As shown, the hydrogel exhibited excellent antibacterial e ciency within 5 min under coirradiation rather than single irradiation. Glutathione (GSH), an antioxidant, is oxidized into glutathione disul de by ROS, therefore acting as a critical player in the bacterial defense system. 189,190Consistent with the antibacterial results, the loss of GSH was much more under the dual light irradiation than 808or 660 nm single light illumination ( Figure 15 C). Investigation on the infected mouse model showed that bacterial infection with ichor was observed in di erent groups after 2 days. However, under the illumination of the dual light, pus wasreduced in the Ag 3PO4/MoS2HD group compared with the other groups ( Figure 15 D).In vivo antibacterial activity studies Figure 17.

In addition, compared with other groups, the outer skin layer treated with Ag 3PO 4/ MoS 2HD was more complete ( Figure 15 E).31 A similar study was carried out by rGO/MoS2/Ag3PO4- embedded PVA hydrogel as antibacterial wound healing dressing in the treatment of infected wounds in vivo (Figure 16A).191It was shown that, compared with rGO and rGO/ MoS2-embedded hydrogels, higher temperature and more ROS were produced 2/Ag 3PO 4-incorporated hydrogel under nm). The enhanced PTDT was related to a collaborative behavior of the embedded PHTA and PHDA. Under the coirradiation, the photoinduced electrons will transferred to the conduction band (CB) ofAg 3PO 4and MoS 2. Subsequently, through the mediating of rGO, the electrons on CB of Ag 3PO 4will be transferred to the valence band (VB) of MoS 2, thus consuming the holes collected on the VB of MoS 2. As a result,\u0081OH and1O2as ROS could be generated by holes on the VB of Ag 3PO 4, thereby decreasing electron ll on the CB of MoS 2. Through this electron transformation, the photocatalytic activity of the hydrogels signicantly improved and more heat was generated.191 In another study, outstanding antibacterial activities were achieved using CuS@MoS 2-incorporated PVA-based hydrogel, and 99.5% of S. aureus and 99.3% of E. coli were killed due to the PTDT under coillumination of 808 and 660 nm light ( Figure 16B).135In fact, during the light irradiation, hyperthermia and ROS generated by the MoS 2and CuS NPs, respectively,improved the bacterial membrane permeability. Therefore, it led to destroying bacterial membrane and proteins by the penetrated ROS and, thus, resulting in the accelerated eradicating of bacteria in vitro andin vivo . In addition, prompted wound healing related to the VEGF and hypoxia-inducible factor expression at the wound site. Graphene-Oxide-Based Photothermal/Photodynamic Synergistic Therapy. In 2019, a simultaneous PDT and PTT strategy was used by GO and ZnO-embedded CTS hydrogels (ZnO@GO-CT hydrogel) for accelerated wound healing applications ( Figure 17 A).192In the MPRHs, GO nanosheets acted as a photothermal agent that could increase the bacteria- killing e ciency of the hydrogels.33,193In addition, ZnO quantum dots (QDs) possessing a large number of conduction band electrons (e) and/or valence band holes (h+) enabled the MPRHs to produce ROS even in the absence of UV light to eliminate bacterial infection during the wound treatment.194 They were dissolved under an acidic environment195to release Zn2+, thus boosting antimicrobial and anti-in flammatory properties of the hydrogels as well. As shown in Figure 17 B, SEM images con rmed that ZnO@GO nanocomposite was uniformly loaded within the hydrogel. The photothermal performance of the hydrogels was power-dependent which power laser of 2.0 W/cm2was selected for further studies (Figure 17 C). Decreasing of the water contact angle by increasing the concentration of ZnO@GO nanocomposite showed that the hydrogel s potential to maintain a moist environment around the wound area and detached from the Figure 18.

The ability of ROS generation of the hydrogels, stemming from the ZnO NPs, was con rmed by decreasing the absorption intensity of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) aROS indicator. In vitro antibacterial activity of the ZnO@GO- CT hydrogels against S. aureus bacteria indicated that the photothermal e ects under 808 nm light irradiation were better than those of the CTS and ZnO@GO nanocomposite alone(Figure 17 D). The same results were observed with Gram- negative bacteria of E. coli .In vivo wound healing studies exhibited that the hybrid hydrogel could kill bacteria whileaccelerating wound healing without side e ects to major organs of the treated mice. 192Such behavior was related to the favorableantibacterial and anti-in flammatory e ects of the hydrogels 808 nm light. Other Photothermal/Photodynamic Synergistic Ther- apy. Nowadays, the design and fabrication of multifunctional hydrogels with both disease-therapeutic and tissue regenerationcapabilities referred to as regenerative hydrogels, which have apositive impact to treat diseases alongside tissue/organregeneration. 196Surgical excision is a general method for the treatment of cutaneous tumors, but complete eradicating ofcancer cells and restoring of normal skin function after thesurgeries remains a major challenge in the treatment of this typeof tumor. 197Therefore, the development of e ective and Figure 19.

Moreover, the Mg 2+ions released from the hydrogels could boost the proliferation, adhesion, andmigration of skin cells, thus leading to accelerating woundclosure signi cantly. 55The real-time temperature changes di erent content of B-TiO 2xNPs are shown in Figure 18 B, which was concentration-dependent. As shown, negligible temperature elevation was observed in the thermogelswithout B-TiO 2xNPs. In addition, ROS generation (1O2)o f the thermogels under NIR irradiation at 808 nm was proved byDPBF degradation, demonstrating the potential of the light-driven hydrogels in PDT ( Figure 18 C). Excellent in vitro andin vivoanticancer e ect was observed by the BT-CTS thermogels because of simultaneous PTT/PDT e ects. Interestingly, in vivo studies on skin tumor-induced wound healing showed that the skin wounds in tumor-bearing mice were gradually healed without signi cant tumor recurrence by photoactive thermogels as wound dressing, hence, con rming the theragenerative capacity of the hydrogels in vivo (Figure 18 D). Using photoresponsive thermogels as a wound dressing to treattumor-induced wounds, normal skin with regular capillariesalong with newly formed tissue was observed in the H&E images(Figure 18 E). In contrast, irregular tumor vascularization under the incomplete epidermis was observable in other treated groups. The regenerative property was also related to the Mg 2+ ions released from hydrogels which had the potential tostimulate the proliferation, adhesion, and migration of normalskin cells to promote the wound healing process. 55Therefore, the theragenerative property of thermogels has a positive impactin simultaneous cancer therapy and wound healing after thesurgical resection of skin tumors. As mentioned, it is indispensable to develop multifunctional hydrogels that can simultaneously act as a wound dressing,antibacterial and antitumor agent. It has been reported that CuSNPs not only could serve as PHTA but also for PDT due to theROS generation under the NIR light illumination. 63,203 Therefore, CuS NP-loaded hydrogels can consider as a kind of promising theragenerative hydrogels with both disease- therapeutic and tissue regeneration capabilities. 2021,injectable CuS NP-loaded were fabricated byincorporating NPs within polyethylene glycol (PEG)-functionalized with amino and thiol groups. the presence ofaldehyde-functionalized dextran polymer the hydrogels (namedas G-CuS x, where x displayed the concentration of CuS NPs) formed viaimine bond formation between the amino end groups of the PEG chain and the aldehyde functional groups of oxidized dextran.204The study showed that the G-CuSxhydrogel was self-healable, injectable, and biocompatible, as well as exhibitedoutstanding PDT and PDT performance on the eradication ofcancer and bacteria both in vitro andin vivo (Figure 19 A). As shown in Figure 19 B, the photothermal behavior of the hydrogels depended on the CuS concentration. Fluorescencespectrophotometry under 808 nm laser irradiation showedincreased \u0081OH generation stemmed the hydrogels, thus conrming CuS NPs acted as PHDA as well ( Figure 19 C).Antibacterial activity of the hydrogels against S. aureus andE. coli was enhanced when the concentration of CuS NPs in thehydrogels increased and was further boosted under NIRirradiation. Such results proved more ROS generation underthe condition, therefore causing the destruction of proteins andDNA of the bacteria and leading to more bactericidalproperties. 204In vivo antitumor studies of the hydrogels showed that the average weight of the excised tumors of the grouptreated with G-CuS1 and illuminated with NIR light ( i.e.,G - CuS1(+) in Figure 19 D) was obviously reduced than the other groups, proving the promising antitumor e ect of the photo- responsive hydrogel in vivo . Studies on the treatment of full-skin- infected wounds on SD rats revealed that remaining woundareas of G-CuS0.5 groups under NIR irradiation were smaller inappearance than the other groups ( Figure 19 E). These results were also con rmed by H&E staining images where quantitative statistical data showed that there were increased bloodcapillaries and collagen deposition in the G-CuS0.5-treatedgroup ( Figure 19 F,G). These positive events in the wound healing process were related to the Cu 2+released from the Cu NP-incorporated hydrogels ofvascular endothelial cells.204 FUTURE PERSPECTIVE AND CONCLUSION Light-responsive phototherapy, including PTT and PDT, is an environment-friendly mode of therapy in wound healing. MPRHs represent a generation of advanced functional biomaterials for diverse applications, including wound healing.Such photoactive and multifunctional hydrogels can be preparedby the incorporation of PHTAs and PHDAs within the porous polymeric hydrogel networks. Each constituent of the MPRHs can alter one or more wound-healing phases, i.e., hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. In addition, the incorporation of PHTAs and PHDAs into hydrogel networkscan improve the mechanical strength of the hydrogels via coordination bonds or other toughening interactions. Theincorporation can also boost conductivity, photoresponsiveness, Figure 20.

In this review, we discussed the design, construction, and underlying healing performance of MPRHs for wound repairapplications, with the main focus on their therapeutic andregenerative functionalities ( Figure 20 ). We have also discussed how di erent compositions of MPRHs, type of light and PHTAs and PHDAs could control antibacterial activity and cellularbehaviors, such as cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, anddierentiation of the MPRHs. Meanwhile, we have provided state-of-art examples that can overcome the drawbacks of singletherapy modes by combining PTT and PDT to achieve acomplementary multi-therapeutic e cacy. In addition to providing many examples of the in vitro cellular studies, we also discussed how the optimized and engineered MPRHs could be exploited in animal models to acquire a satisfactory healingperformance ( Table 1 ). Despite the recent achievements in this arena it should be emphasized that still many challenges and critical issues haveremained to be addressed in the future by fundamental andtransitional studies ( Figure 20 ). These include (1) complete evaluation of toxicity of the MPRHs to surrounding tissues andother organs after the degradation of the hydrogel matrix, (2)development of the diverse forms of MPRHs for the easy andsuitable route of administration, including patches and implants,for speci c practical applications including the regenerative internal/external surgical closure, (3) deep understanding onthe mechanism between phototherapy and injured vessels andimmune responses, 205(4) development of other antibacterial agents including the use of gas-releasing bactericidal mole-cules206,207not only against planktonic bacteria but also on the biolms protecting resident bacteria from external attacks and increase their resistance to antibiotics, (5) development ofcombination of phototherapy with other modalities, includingchemodynamic therapy, hydrogels regeneration capabilities for simultaneous cancer therapyand wound healing after the surgical resection of skintumors, 208,204and (7) controlling the biodegradation of MPRHs, especially metal ion doping ones for further preclinicalstudies and clinical translation. This review will attract great attention from groups working on interdisciplinary research in tissue engineering science,chemistry, microbiology, and polymer science. In addition, moreand more collaborations among fundamental, translational, andindustrial entities are the indispensable part of moving MPRHs to the clinic. It is our hope that more collaborative e orts will be devoted to the development of advanced MPRHs to address allchallenges discussed in this review and alleviate hurdles oftreating di cult-to-treat wounds.
