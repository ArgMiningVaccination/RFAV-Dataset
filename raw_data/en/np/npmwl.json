The efficacy of TCM syndrome, epilepsy seizure frequency, Electroencephalogram (EEG), life quality, cognitive function and safety of each group were observed at the middle of and after treatment. Results found that, after treatment, the epilepsy seizure times in TCM-WM group were significantly less than control group (P<0.05). The total effective rate of TCM syndrome in TCM-WM group was 82.8%, which was significantly higher than 71.4% in control group (P<0.05). The total effective rates of EEG in TCM-WM group and control group were 82.7% and 57.1%, respectively, with significant difference between them (P<0.05). The life quality score in TCM-WM group was 24.91 \u00b1 11.48, significantly lower than 14.59 in group (P<0.05), and the quotient in TCM-WM \u00b1 than 69.26 \u00b1 11.49 in control group (P<0.05). There was no obvious adverse reaction after treatment in each group. The TCM-WM integrated treatment has good efficacy and safety for patients with late-onset epilepsy after cerebral hemorrhage.Author(s): Renjing Liu, Zhonghua Jiang, Changyan Wu, Jiaquan Chen, Suai Tao "}
