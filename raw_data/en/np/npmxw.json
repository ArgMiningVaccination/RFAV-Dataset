This is a limited edition set. Citrine is a joyful crystal with bright energy, it is a premier stone of manifestation, imagination, and personal will. Citrine contains a solar quality of energy and is traditionally considered a good healing crystal for the solar plexus/third chakra. It can help strengthen self-esteem and a positive, vibrant flow of energy in and around one's body. Citrine does not hold or accumulate negative energy, but rather transmutes, dissipates, and grounds it, making it a protective shield. It works out problems on both the physical and subtle levels, transforming negative thoughts and feelings into positive ones. (our Citrine is all natural and not heat treated). Sunstone's radiant appearance is reminiscent of the sun and its solar properties will assist at stimulating personal power, sexual energy, healing, protection, leadership, and abundance. Its reflective Light qualities brings joy, warmth, strength, luck, and harmony. Sunstone carries yang energy as balances with the yin energy of moonstone. Sunstone identifies best with the Sacral chakra as it is the center of Life Force in the body and controls the flow of information from the body to the mind and back again through the body. Due to its solar light qualities, sunstone also assists in clearing the aura and all chakras. Tiger Eye is usually a metamorphic rock, but is also a variety of macrocrystalline quartz which is a great amplifier of energy. Tigers Eye brings balance to the mind, stability, personal power, strengthens clarity, good fortune, and creativity. Its solar qualities of the Sun and grounding qualities of the Earth stimulate the Root, Sacral, and Solar Plexus chakras. Black Obsidian is a highly protective stone it is known to shield against negative energies, eases stress and tension, and offers release from nervousness, trauma, and negative attachments. It is helpful in developing ones own intuition while grounding you to Earths energy. They work by helping you to move any excess energy down via the Earth Star Chakra to Mother Earth for grounding. I sage cleanse & charge all of my crystals with Reiki energy to further enhance the healing benefits of each stone. Please handle with love and care as these are natural gemstones and can break or crack if hit too hard or dropped. "}
