Protect yourself with the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) , if available (e.g., gloves, safety glasses .) Then g ive immediate First aid or CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation). See below. 2. Call 911 from an o n-campus phone or 518 4 42-3131 from a cell phone to reach the University Police Department. If indicated, an ambulance will be summoned. If on the Health Sciences Campus/ East Campus , dial 9 -911 for the East Greenbush Police. 3. Speak slowly and clearly. 4. Give the nature of the emergency. 5. Give the location of the emergency. 6. Give the number and condition of victims. 7. Give the phone number you are using and your name. 8. Hang up last, after the dispatcher does. IN CASE OF CHEMICAL POISONING /EXPOSURE : 1. Follow the same procedures as for Medical Emergency above. 2. Take SDS* with victim. FIRST AID The emergency phone number for the Uptown and Downtown campus es is: 911 for FIRE - POLICE - MEDICAL 9-911 for Health Sciences Campus/ East Campus Dial 518 442-3131 for University Police Department, if using a cell phone on the Uptown or Downtown campus es 12 *Safety Data Sheet (SDS) MEDICAL EMERGENCY PROCEDURES (Cont'd.) GENERAL FIRST AID INSTRUCTIONS In the event of an injury or other emergency, it is important to summon professional assistance immediately. The following instructions are intended only as guidelines for untrained people in providing assistance to the victim during the first few minutes, until professional assistance arri ves. It is preferable to have a person trained in First Aid, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) providing assistance during the first few minutes. The Office of Environmental Health and Safety urges each depart ment to consider having several people trained in First Aid, CPR and AEDs . Contact EH&S or 5 Quad Volunteer Ambulance Service 518 442-5555 to inquire about First Aid , CPR and AED training. EH&S offers online AED training on UAlbany's Blackboard. 1. Effe ct rescue only if it can be safely done and it is necessary to prevent victim from further injury while summoning an ambulance by dialing 911 or 518 442 -3131 from your cell phone (9-911 East Campus). Otherwise, do not move the victim or allo w him/her to m ove until the injuries have been assessed. Protect yourself with the appropriate personal protective equipment, if available (e.g., gloves, safety glasses.) 2. Ensure an adequate airway. 3. Ensure adequate breathing (give mouth -to-mouth or mouth -to-nose respiration, if necessary). 4. Check for circulation by feeling for a pulse at the neck or wrist, if absent begin CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation), if you are trained to do so. 5. Control severe bleeding by the use of direct pressure. THERMAL BU RNS 1. Submerge the burned area in cold water (except for third -degree burns). This will significantly reduce both swelling and pain. A third -degree burn is one in which tissue damage has occurred. 2. Apply a dry sterile dressing. 3. Do not break any blisters. 4. Do not use any commercial sprays or home remedies (butter, etc.). 5. Always s eek medical atten tion (University Health Center or Hospital.) CYROGENIC BURNS If exposed to liquid or cold gas, restore tissue to normal body temperature 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C) as rapidly as possible, followed by protection of the injured tissue from further damage and infection. Remove or loosen clothing that may constrict blood circulation to the frozen area. Seek medical attention. Rapid warming of the affected part is best achieved by using water at 108\u00b0F/42\u00b0C). Under no circumstances 13 should the water be over 112\u00b0F/44\u00b0C, nor should the frozen part be rubbed either before or after rewarmin g. The patient should neither smoke, nor drink alcohol. MEDICAL EMERGENCY PROCEDURES (Cont'd.) Most liquid nitrogen burns are really bad cases of frostbite. We don't mean to belittle the harm that can come from frostbite, but at the same time, we wanted t o keep the dangers associated with liquid nitrogen burns in perspective. Indeed, liquid nitrogen burns could be treated as frostbite. CHEMICALS IN THE EYE 1. Flush the eye with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes being careful not to wash t he chemical into the other eye. Use an eyewash fountain if one is available. Another person should assist the victim by holding open the victim's eye , while it is being flushed. 2. Always s eek medical attention and have the chemic al's SDS accompany the victim. CHEMICAL BURNS 1. Brush any chemicals off the skin with a clean cloth, gloved hand, etc. Flush the affected area with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. If necessary, cut off or use tweezers to remove chem ically soaked clothing; avoid touching contaminated areas of clothing. If prudent, try to preserve the victim's modesty while under the safety shower by holding up a lab coat or towel to prevent unnecessary viewing by others. Continue to flush skin for several minutes more after clothing has been removed. 2. Apply a sterile dressing. 3. Always s eek medical attent ion and have the chemical's SDS accompany the victim. 4. All chemically contaminated clothing must be thoroughly washed prior to re-wearing or disposed of as hazardous waste . *Safety Data Sheet (SDS) NOTE In the event of an accident or injury, always notify the Principal I nvestigator, instructor, supervisor or other person in charge as soon as possible. In all cases of personal injury/accident, a \"Supervisor's Report of Employee's Alleged Accident\" (Form PS -1 for faculty/staff) or a \"Report of Student/Public Accident or Public Injur y\" (Form LP -5 for student/visitor) must be filled out. The employee accident form is available on -line at http://hr.albany.edu/content/empacc.doc These forms are also ava ilable in the Department Chair's Office or in the EH&S Office in Chem. B72 . Also, a ll lab accidents or near misses ( good catc hes) must be documented on a Laboratory Incident /Accident & Good Catch Report Form . https://www.albany.edu/ehs/pdf/LaboratoryIncidentReport.pdf 14 MEDICAL EMERGENCY PROCEDURES (Cont'd.)

CHEMICAL SPILL PROCEDURES (Cont'd.) CHEMICAL SPILL FIRST AID PROCEDURES If an individual becomes contaminated with a spilled chemical, particularly if the words TOXIC, ACID, CAUSTIC or CORROSIVE appear: 1. Brush any dry chemicals off the skin and clothing with a clean cloth, gloved hand, etc. 2. Flush the affected area with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes, usi ng the nearest safety shower, or in the case of eye contamination, the nearest eye wash fountain. If necessary, cut off or use tweezers to remove chemically contaminated clothing, being careful not to touch contaminated areas. Continue to flush skin for se veral minutes after clothing has been removed. NOTE: You may have to bodily hold the individual under the running water. If the individual's eyes are affected, you may have to hold their eyes open while they are being flushed. DO NOT BECOME CONTAMINATED YO URSELF! In order to prevent unnecessary viewing of the victim, when possible t ry to preserve the victim's modesty by holding up a lab coat or towel while they are under the safety shower . 3. Always s eek medical help by calling 911 (or if on the Health Sc iences Campus/ East Campus 9 -911) or dial 518 442 -3131 on your cell or by taking the individual to the University Health Center on Dutch Quad . 4. Later, have the individual fill out a personal injury/accident form, LP -5 form for students/visitors and PS-1 form for faculty/staff. These forms are available in the Departm ent Chair's Office or in the EH &S Office in Chemistry B72 . The employee accident form is available on -line at http://hr.albany.edu/content/empacc.doc 5. All contaminated clothing must be thoroughly washed before being worn again. If the clothing is heavily contaminated, depending on what was spilled, it may have to be disposed of as hazardous waste. *All lab inc idents/accidents and near misses ( good catches ), must be reported on a Laboratory Incident/Accident & Good Catch Report form, in addition to a personal injury/accident form. https://www.albany.edu/ehs/pdf/LaboratoryIncidentReport.pdf *Always read a chemical's Safety Data Sheets (SDS) before using. The SDS will review chemical spill first aid procedures. 19 II. FIRE SAFETY 20 A. FIRE PROTECTION One of the more serious problems that can confront an individual in a laboratory is the spectra of a fire. Electrical equipment, open flames, static electricity, burning tobacco, lighted matches and hot surfaces can all cause ignition of flammable materials. Flammable liquids, powders of combustible solids, compressed and liquified gases are always prevalent; and therefore, caution shoul d be exercised whenever an open flame is required for any particular experiment. Fire falls into four main classes depending on the types of fuel they burn : Class A - ordinary solid combustibles, such as paper, wood, textiles, etc. Class B - flammable liquids, such as gasoline, oil, solvents, etc. Class C - A fire where an electrical current is present, or where a shock hazard could be a reality Class D - burning metals, such as sodium, potassium, metal hydrides, etc. Each type of fire requires an extinguisher specifically applicable to controlling that particular fire: Class A - water extinguisher or an ABC dry chemical fire extinguisher Class B - carbon dioxide, BC dry chemical or ABC dry chemical fire extinguisher Class C - carbon dioxide, BC dry chemical or ABC dry chemical fire extinguisher Class D - met-1-x fire extinguisher (available on the second and third floors of Chemistry) Flammable substances are those that readily catch fire and burn in air. A flammable liquid does not itself burn; it is the vapors from the liquid that burn. The rate at which different liquids produce flammable vapors depends on their vapor pressure, which increases with temperature. The degree of fire hazard depends also on the ability to form combustible or e xplosive mixtures with air, the ease of ignition of these mixtures, and the relative densities of the liquid with respect to water and of the gas with respect to air. These properties can us ually be found on a chemical's Safety Data Sheet (SDS) . These con cepts can be evaluated and compared in terms of a number of properties: Flash Point: The lowest temperature, as determined by standard tests, at which a liquid gives off vapor in sufficient concentration to form an ignitable mixture with air near the surface of the liquid within the test vessel. Many common laboratory solvents and chemi cals have flash points that are lower than room temperature. 21 FIRE PROTECTION - (Cont'd.) Ignition Temperature: The minimum temperature required to initiate or cause self -sustained combustion independent of the heat source. Limits of Flammability: a) Lower Flammable Limit (Lower explosive limit LEL) is the minimum concentration (percent by volume) of the vapor in air below which a flame is not propagated when an ignition source is present. Below this concentration, the mixture is too lean to burn. b) Upper Flammable Limit (Upper explosive limit UEL) is the maximum concentration (percent by volume) of the vapor in air above which a flame is not propagated when an ignition source is present. Above this concentration, the mixture is too rich to burn . Autoignition: Takes place when a substance reaches its ignition temperature without the application of external heat. Materials susceptible to autoignition include oily rags, dust accumulations, organic materials mixed with strong oxidizing agents ( such as nitric acid, chlorates, permanganates, peroxides, and persulfates), alkali metals such as sodium and potassium, finely divided pyrophoric metals, and phosphorus. See Appendix A. The basic precautions for the safe handling of flammable materials include the following: 1. Flammable substances should be handled only in areas free of ignition sources. 2. Flammable substances should never be heated by using an open flame. Preferred heat sources include steam baths, water baths, oil baths, heating man tles, and hot air baths. 3. Before lighting a flame, remove all flammable substances from the immediate area. Check all containers of flammable materials in the area to ensure that they are tightly closed. 4. When transferring flammable liquids in metal equipment, static generated sparks should be avoided by bonding from container to container and the use of ground straps. The grounding straps must go to an earth ground. Be sure the clamps on all straps are hitting metal and not just the paint on the containers. 5. Notify other occupants of the laboratory in advance of lighting a flame. 6. A flame -resistant la b coat must be worn by any individual in a lab using flammable ma terials or pyrophoric materials . These are sold in C.A.S. Stores. 7. Store flammable materials properly. Use a flammable liquid storage cabinet whenever possible. Flammable liquid storage cabinets can be requested through t he Office Environmental Health and Safety. See Section V.A. for guidelines on the proper storage of fl ammable liquids. 8. When volatile, flammable materials may be present, use only non -sparking electrical equipment. 9. Ventilation is one of the most effective ways to prevent the formation of flammable mixtures. An exhaust hood should be used whenever ap preciable quantities of flammable substances are transferred from one container to another, allowed to stand in open containers, or handled in any other way. 22 FIRE PROTECTION - (Cont'd.) Compressed or liquified gases present hazards in the event of fire be cause the heat will cause the pressure to increase and may rupture the container. Leakage or escape of flammable gases can produce an explosive atmosphere in the laboratory. Acetylene, hydrogen, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide are especially hazardous. When a liquified gas is used in a closed system, pressure may buildup, so that adequate venting is required. If the liquid is flammable (i.e., hydrogen), explosive concentrations may develop. Any, or all, of the three problems, flammability, tox icity, and pressure buildup, may come serious. Suspensions of oxidizable particles (such as magnesium powder, zinc dust, or flowers of sulfur) in the air constitute of powerful explosive mixture. Care should be exercised in handling these materials to avo id exposure to ignition sources. See Appendix A. 23 B.

IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE, FOLLOW THESE PROCEDURES 1. Notify laboratory occupants to evacuate. 2. Pull the building alarm box at the nearest exit. Evacuate the building. DO NOT USE ELEVATOR S. Close all doors behind you.1 If no alarm box, dial 911 or 518 442-3131, if using a cell phone or if on the Health Sciences Campus/ East Campus, dial 9 -911 3. Notify the Office of Environmental Health and Safety at 518 442-3495 , as soon as possible regarding the nature of the fire and materials involved. 4. If a person's clothing should catch fire, douse the individual with water (use a safety shower or ey ewash drench hose, if one is readily available) or have the individual , cover their face and drop to the floor and roll. If necessary , physically restrain the person and roll them around the floor to smother the flames. STOP, COVER FACE WITH HANDS, DROP and ROLL. 5. Learn the location and the use of the nearest fire extinguishe r, types of fire extinguishers available and the procedures for exiting during a fire. Look in building corridors for appropriate evacuation routes.2 Only use a fire extinguisher after you have established a safe exit route , you have been trained in the usage of a fire extinguisher, and you feel you are capable of putting out the fire. PLAY IT SAFE! Know your limitations; do not compromise you r life in a hazardous situation. No one is expected to put out a fire, except the fire department. 6. Contact the Office of Code Administration for any problems concerning fire safety related items at 518 442-3400 . REMEMBER THE ACRONYM \"RACE\", IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE: RACE 1. RESCUE - those in imminent danger 2. ACTIVATE - the building's fire alarm system 3. CONTAIN - the fire and smoke by closing fire doors 4. EXTINGUISH - the fire only if the fire is small, contained and you are trained in fire extinguisher usage *All lab inc idents/accidents and good catches , must be r eported on a Laboratory Incident/Accident & Good Catch Report form, in addition to a personal injury/accident form. https://www.albany.edu/ehs/pdf/LaboratoryIncidentReport.pdf This includes all lab fires. 1 The doors within a building, especially in stairwells and in corridors, are required to meet State Fire Code. Doors in stairwells must never be propped open. Open doors will allow the spread of smoke and fire to the exits, rendering them useless. Doors in corridors are smoke partitions; they separate areas limiting the spread of smoke, fire, or fumes to adjacent areas. Th is serves two purposes: limiting damage and/or contamination and extending escape time. Do not prop them open or use magnetic stirrers to keep them unlocked . 2 Building corridors and stairwells are fire exits. NO material shall be placed in any exitwa y. This includes furniture, equipment, boxes, etc. 25 D. FIRE EXTINGUISHER USAGE PROCEDURES: 1. Pull the alarm box - this will evacuate the building and summon aid. 2. Remem ber RACE: Rescue - those in imminent danger Activate - the building's fire alarm system Contain - the fire and smoke by closing fire doors Extinguish - only if the fire is small, contained and you are trained in fire extinguisher usage IF IN DOUBT, GET OU T! No one is expected to put out a fire, except the fire department. 2. Fight a small fire only (rule of thumb -no larger than a small trash can) and only use a fire extinguisher, if you have been trained and feel confident in using one. Always place the fire extinguisher between you and the fire. If the fire gets large, g et out! Close doors to slow the fire spread. Stay between the fire and an exit. Do not let fire block your escap e path, in case the fire gets out of control. 3. Make sure you use the correct type of fire extinguisher (see page 20). Make sure you do not us e one type extinguisher on another type fire; it may make the fire worse. 4. Learn how to PASS . P ULL Pull the pin. Some units require the releasing of a lock latch, pressing a puncture lever, or other motion. A IM Aim the extinguisher nozzle (horn or hose) at the base of the fire. S QUEEZE Squeeze or press the handle. S WEEP Sweep from side to side at the base of the fire until it goes out. Shut off the extinguisher. Watch for reflash and reactivate the extinguisher, if necessary. Foam and water exti nguishers require slightly different action. Read the instructions. *All lab inc idents/accidents and near misses ( good catches ), must be reported on a Laboratory Incident/Accident & Good Catch Report form, in addition to a personal injury/accident form. https://www.albany.edu/ehs/pdf/LaboratoryIncidentReport.pdf This includes all lab fires. 26 III. SAFETY PROCEDURES FOR LABORATORY OPERATIONS 27 A. GENERAL SAFETY PROCEDURES 1. New York State Education Law Section 409 -A requires the use of eye protection when working in a laboratory. Chemical splash goggles should be worn wherever chemicals are used or stored. Contact lenses are prohibited. Particulate matter, liquids, vapors, and gases can lodge behind contact lenses and cause considerable eye damage before they can be washed out with water from an eyewash fountain. Visitors must w ear eye protection while in laboratories. 2. Adult visitors in laboratories must be accompanied by a faculty or staff member or a graduate student. Children are PROHIBITED in all laboratories. All laboratories must be locked when unattended. Magnetic stirrers must not be used to hold lab doors open. 3. Avoid unnecessary exposure to all chemicals. Always review a chemical's Safety Data Sheet (SDS) before using. The SDS will give the chemical's routes of exposure and the signs and symptoms o f overexposure. Wear lab coats or aprons and gloves to protect clothing and skin. Lab coats are preferable to aprons as they cover your arms. If handling pyrophoric or flammable liquids or solids, flame -resistant lab coats must be worn. Outside of the labo ratory, except when transporting chemicals and/or hazardous materials, lab coats and gloves serve no purpose, could spread contamination and should be left behind in the laboratory. Shorts, cut -offs, capris, halter tops , sandals , flip flops, and open toe shoes MAY NOT be worn in the laboratory area. Long hair and dangling jewelry should be contained. 4. Label all containers of chemicals, including waste chemicals. Include your name, the chemicals used, their concentrations and d ate prepared on the label of all solutions. Put the opening date and disposal dat e on all materials that degrade, such as peroxides and ethers. Never use any substance from an unlabeled or inadequately labeled container. Waste labels by law must contain th e words \"Hazardous Waste\". 5. Use laboratory fume hoods when handling flammable, toxic, or noxious agents. Before conducting any work in a fume hood, firs t check to see if the fume hood is operating by checking the air flow monitor or using a vaneometer .* IF NO AIR MOVEMENT IS EVIDENT, IMMEDIATELY CO NTACT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AT 518 442-3480 . Health Sciences or 518 591 -8400 . 6. Eating, drinking, and smoking are PROHIBITED in the laboratory areas. 7. Know the location of the nearest safety shower, eyewash station, fire extinguisher and spill kits. Keep them clean and unobstructed. 8. Mouth suction must NEVER be used to fill pipettes, start siphons, or for any other purpose. 9. Never perform experimen tal work in the laboratory alone, or at least without another person within easy call. Make sure that person knows you are working alone and have that person check up on you periodically . No undergraduate laboratory work is to be carried out in the absen ce of an instructor , P.I. or senior research staff. Perform only authorized experiments. Unapproved variations are prohibited . Research people who are responsible for their own experimental programs should inform others working in the area of the chemical s being used and the possible hazards involved. All reactions are to be attended or made fail -safe if left alone or overnight. Reactions should be labeled with the name and phone number of the contact person in case of an emergency. *Vaneometers are avail able for free through the Office of Environmental Health and Safety. 28 GENERAL SAFETY PROCEDURES (Cont'd.) 10. Work with materials only when you know their flammability, reactivity, corrosiveness and toxicity. Before working with any chemi cal, review the manufacturer's Safety Data Sheet (SDS) (for additional information contact the Office of Environmental H ealth and Safety - Chemistry B72 ). Read all labels thoroughly. Know not only the material's associated health hazards but also its phys ical hazards. All P.I.s should be aware of the research being performed in their laboratories. No one should be allowed to perform research without first reviewing the risks of their research with their P. I. This includes both health risks and physical ris ks (fire, explosion). All risks should be addressed in a written safety protocol for that particular experiment reviewed by both the P.I. and the researcher . 11. All known poisons and known carcinogens should be handled with extreme care and kept under l ock and key. All Department of Homeland Security Chemicals of Interest (COIs) must be kept secure at all times. Whenever possible, acrylamide should be purchased in solution, and not in powder form, due to its toxicity. Refer to the SDS on acrylamide fo r more information. 12. A women who works in a laboratory while pregnant should be especially careful to avoid contact with chemicals, particularly those that are embryotoxic or teratogenic. If there is any possibility that you may be pregnant or considering pregnancy, it is strongly suggested that you consult with your physician concerning possible hazards from exposure to chemicals in the laboratory. 13. Apparatus attached to a ring -stand should be positioned so that the system's center of gravity is over the base and not to one side - the lower the better, but with adequate room for removing burners or baths. 14. Provide a vent for chemicals that are to be heated. Prior to heating a liquid, place boiling stones in vessels (other than test tubes). Use a thermometer in a boiling liquid , if there is the possibility of dangerous exothermic decomposition, as in some distillations. This will provide warning and may allow time to remove the heat and apply external cooling. 15. Fire poli sh all glass tubing and rods. Use the proper techniques for inserting and removing a glass tube from a stopper. Shortcuts can lead to a severely punctured hand. Protect hands with gloves, towel, or tubing holder when inserting or removing tubing from stopp ers. Lubricate the tubing with water or glycerine . Keep hand on tubing close to the stopper and out of line with the end of the tube. 16. NEVER look down the opening of a vessel unless it is empty. 17. Use beaker covers to prevent splattering when heatin g liquids on a hot plate. Keep a pair of tongs conveniently at hand - a specific pair of tongs for the dish, crucible, beaker, casserole, or flask being used. 18. NEVER pour ether, petroleum ether, or other flammable, water -immersible liquids into sinks t o be washed down with water. Fires have been caused in laboratories by vapors returning through the drainage system. It is also illegal to put most chemicals down the drain. See Hazardous Waste Disposal Procedures - Section VII. 19. Each lab must have a current inventory of the chemicals within it , along with a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for each chemical on the inventory . This inventory should be readily available in the 29 GENERAL SAFETY PROCEDURES (Cont'd.) event of an emergency. The inventory and accompanying safety data sheets need to be kept either as hard copies or in a database that is easily accessible to all lab members. This database can either have PDFs of the SDSs or actual links to the manufacturer's SDSs. This database should be backed up on an USB drive. This inventory , along with the SDSs, need s to be kept updated by the lab staff with the arrival of new chemicals or after the chemical is no longer being used in the lab and has been disposed of as hazardous waste . A copy of the lab's inventory should be sent to the EH&S Office in Chemistry B72 at the beginning of each calendar year. 20. Before opening any bottle o n which the lid or top is stuck, first make sure there are no additional hazards with opening the bottle such as peroxide formation or pressure buildup in the bottle. If there are no additional hazards associated with opening the bottle, wrap the bottle wi th a towel and place it in a metal container before cutting the lid. Use the same precautions when opening an ampoule, and at the same time, be careful that the liquid in the ampoule is cold. NEVER open an ampoule containing a flammable liquid by heating t he tip with a flame. When opening bottles which may be under pressure (e.g., hydrochloric acid, formic acid or ammonium hydroxide), cover the bottle with a towel to divert any chemical spray, and open under a fume hood. 21. When transferring chemicals, make certain the container is compatible with the chemical. 22. Adequate traps must be used in vacuum systems in which mechanical pumps are used, to prevent corrosion of the pump and/or biological/chemical contamination of the pump . Do not rele ase the vacuum in any apparatus when the temperature is above 150\u00b0C. The hot vapors may explode. 23. Use only the necessary length of rubber or other flexible tubing and keep it to the rear of the set -up. The water pressure at the University may occasiona lly vary and in the past has caused several water supply lines to pop off and flood laboratories , causing various degrees of damage . Thus, all connecting hoses, especially water supply lines, MUST be fastened with either clamps or wires. If the water lines are not secured and a flood occurs, the department and/or principal investigator may be charged for any damages caused by the flood. 24. Do not mix incompatible chemicals. If in doub t, always check the chemical's Safety Data Sheet (SDS) or a source book before mixing chemicals. Always add a reagent slowly; never \"dump it in.\" Observe what takes place when the first amount is added and wait a few moments before adding more; some reactions take time to start. ALWAYS ADD ACIDS TO WATER CAUTIOUSLY, WHILE ST IRRING. NEVER POUR WATER INTO ACID 25. Appropriate eye protection must be worn when working with lasers or other optical sources , including UV lamps . Contact the Radiati on Safety Officer (Chemistry B72 ) at 518 442-3495 for additional info. 26. REMEMBER THAT THE PHYSICAL HAZARDS OF A CHEMICAL ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS KNOWING AS ITS HEALTH HAZ ARDS. Physical hazard means a chemical for which there is scientifically valid evidence that it is a combustible liquid, a compressed gas, explosive, flamm able, corrosive, an organic peroxide, an oxidizer, pyrophoric, unstable (reactive) or water -reactive. 30 B. HOUSEKEEPING 1. Set up and label separate waste receptacles for paper and glass. Oily rags and other oil -impregnated materials should be stored in an approved, covered, metal container and disposed of by calling the EH&S Office at 518 442-3495. DO NOT PUT NOXIOUS MATERIALS IN THE TRASH. Contact the Office of Environmental Health and Safety for proper disposal. 2. Empty chemical co ntainers are to be triple rinsed with water, or the appropriate solvent depending on the chemical, and taken down to the C.A.S. Scientific Stores for disposal. The custodial staff is not responsible for the disposal of these containers. See Section VII.D. 3. Aisles and hal lways should not be obstructed. Benches, tables, desks, and fume hoods are work areas, not storage space. Keep work areas clean. Keep drawers and cabinets closed. Keep all chemicals off the floor. Do not store chemicals overhead. 4. Equipment with moving parts (gears, belts, pulleys) MUST be equipped with protective guards. DO NOT REMOVE machine g uards. 5. Centrifuge tubes should be in good condition - no chips or other flaws. Tubes should be balanced when in use. 6. Oven temperature regulators s hould be checked periodically to ensure that they are working reliably. 7. Use undamaged, clean glassware - no chips or other flaws. 8. Dewar flasks should be taped when in use or enclosed in metal mesh to protect personnel from flying glass. In general, if apparatus is likely to shatter, either because of pressure or vacuum, surround it with mesh or cloth to limit the travel of particles and to protect personnel. 9. Do not attempt to catch glassware , if it is dropped or knocked over. Glass apparatus sho uld be set well back from the front edge of the work bench to lessen the risk of injury , if there is an accidental breakage of glass. 10. Sink traps and floor drains should be kept filled with water at all times to prevent escape of sewer gases into the l aboratory. Such gases may be toxic or flammable and may be ignited, causing flash fires. A little mineral oil may be poured down drains that are not used on a regular basis. This will prevent their traps from drying out and odors from escaping. 11. Chemic als should not be poured down the drain or put in the trash. See Hazardous Waste Disposal Procedures - Section VII. 12. Each water supply outlet within the laboratory should be equipped with either a vacuum breaker or a back -flow prevention device. No auxiliary plumbing should be connected to a water distribution line , unless adequate back -flow prevention is provided. 31 HOUSEKEEPING (Cont'd.) 13. Keep all safety showers and eyewash stations clean and unobstructed. INSPECT AND FLUSH EYEWASH STATIONS AND DRENCH HOSES WEEKLY and denote date on the attached inspection tag. If the eyewash is not working properly , contact Customer Service at 518 442-3480. If you need an eyewash and/or safety shower installed, contact the Office of Environmental Health and Safety in Chemistry B72 . On the Health Sciences Campus/East Campus, the eyewashes and safety showers are tested by Aramark and should be contacted for problems or repairs at 518 257 -2036. 14. A sign should be fastened on the outside of the door of every laboratory and chemical storage area. This sign should contain the names and phone numbers of the people who should be notified in the event of an emergency. These signs are available on-line at : https://www.albany.edu/ehs/pdf/LaboratoryEntranceSign2017.pdf 15. Appropriate warning signs should be posted near any dangerous equipment, reaction, experiment or Condition and certain carcinogens . See Appendix I on Designated Areas. 16. Keep laboratory doors closed at ALL times. Leaving a laboratory door open interferes with the air flow of the fume hoods, disrupts the building's air handling system and allows various odors to circulate around the building. Laboratory doors must be lock ed, if the laboratory is unattended. Do not use magnetic stirrers to hold the door open. Also, keep building fire doors CLOSED at all times , as fire doors prevent the spread of smoke and flames, in the event of an actual fire. 17. Clean up all spilled che micals, water, and broken glassware immediately. Keep floors unobstructed, dry, and free from slippery materials. DO NOT STORE CHEMICALS IN GLASS CONTAINERS ON THE FLOOR. Chemicals should not be stored on the floor or overhead. 18. Keep caps and lids of c hemical containers , including hazardous waste containers, closed when not in use as this prevents contamination and vapor escape. 19. Before leaving the laboratory, turn off all services not in use such as water, electricity, gases and vacuums. Bunsen bu rners should not be left burning when not in use. They should be turned off at the petcocks. Do not depend upon turning a gas burner off at its base. 20. Use only the necessary length of rubber or other flexible tubing and keep it to the rear of the set -up. All connecting hoses, especially water supply lines MUST be fastened with either clamps or wire. NOTE: Water pressure may increase at nigh t. 21. The contents of refrigerators /freezers in laboratories should be reviewed and ins pected at regular intervals and should not exceed six months. Do not store materials in open containers in the refrigerator. Food and any hazardous material (chemical, biological, radioactive, etc.) must NOT be st ored together in a refrigerator because of the possibility of contamination. Only manu facturer approved refrigerators or freezers for the storage of flammables may be used for the storage of flammable materials. See Refrigerators - Section V.F. 22. Keep all air vents unobstructed at all times. DO NOT COVER THEM. It will affect the air flow of the fume hoods. 23. DO NOT COVER WINDOWS IN DOORS , particularly on laboratory doors, as this poses a potential life threatening hazard in the event of a fire o r chemical spill. In the event of an emergency evacuation, personnel checking the building for occupants cannot see into the rooms. 32 C. TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS Transporting hazardous substances from one location to another within the Universi ty can be a serious safety and health problem. Individuals could be unduly exposed through carelessness or neglect. For these reasons, extra precautions are not only prudent, but necessary. RULES FOR TRANSPORTING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS 1. Unbreakable contai ners must be used to transport bulk amounts of chemicals. 2. All chemicals in glass containers MUST be transported in bottle carriers. These carriers are available either for loan or purchase from CAS Scientific Stores. The Stores will not release any tox ic or hazardous chemical unless it is in an unbreakable carrier or in a bottle carrier. 3. All compressed gas cylinders, including empties, MUST be secured upright to a cylinder hand truck with the cylinder valve cap in place. This includes cryogenic tank s. 4. Whenever transporting liquid nitrogen tanks (or any cryogenic that is venting) in elevators, make sure another person is waiting for you when you exit the elevator. This will ensure that you have someone available to summon help should the elevator break down and/or you are overcome by the over -venting of the gas. If at all possible, no one should ride in an elevator with a venting cryogenic tank. 5. When transporting chemicals and/or compressed gases for University use in vehicles, on or off -campus, contact the Office of Environmental Health and Safety for the appropriate procedures and paper work. Chemicals and/or compressed gasses should not be transported in personal vehicles. 6. Do not transport unstable materials, e.g. o ld peroxide -forming chemicals. Contact EH &S at 518 442- 3495 for assistance in evaluating the material . 33 D. FUME HOOD PRACTICES Improper fume hood practices often render the hood useless and unsafe. The hoods are only secondary safety devices and must be used in conjunction with good laboratory safety practices. The following information will help the user attain a higher degree of safety: 1. Prior to fume hood usage, become familiar with the location of the nearest exit, emergency shower, drench hose eyewash station and fire extinguisher, and be sure the pathways to these locales are unobstructed. 2. Verify that the hood is operating properly before each usage . Use the installed airflow monitor, a vaneometer, or a piece of tissue to check for airflow. A reading of 80 - 150 fpm on the monitor or vaneometer indicates good airflow. DO NOT USE THE HOOD , IF ADEQUATE AIRFLOW IS NOT INDICATED. Notify the other occupants in the lab of the problem , post a \"do not use\" sign on the fume hood and immediately contact the Power Plant at 518 442-3444 (24 hours) . If you need a free vaneometer, contact the Office of Environmental He alth and Safety in Chemistry B72 . All fume hoods are tested annually by a third party, in accordance with ASHRAE, ANSI Z9.5 and NFPA 45 standards. 3. DO NOT USE HOODS ON FRIDAY MORNINGS BETWEEN 7:30 AM & NOON. Every Friday morning between 7:30 am and noon , the Academic HVAC crew inspects the machinery in the air monitors in the Biology, Chemistry including the Ion Implanter, Earth Science, Fine Arts and Physics buildings. (If Friday is a holiday, Monday is the inspection day.) In order to protect the HVAC maintenance crew while they are in the monitors where the fume hood exhaust fans are located, it is mandated that on Friday mornings the fume hoods not be used until noon. Be sure all chemicals in the hood are in sealed containers. Also, do not send anyth ing toxic up the vacuum lines that exhaust on the roof during this time frame. 4. Always wear safety goggles, gloves and a lab coat when working around the hood. Whenever possible, use the fume hood when handling hazardous chemicals and read the chemicals ' SDSs for safe handling. 5. KEEP THE HOOD UNCLUTTERED; THE MORE CLUTTERED A HOOD, THE MORE AIR FLOW DISTURBANCES POSSIBLE. Keep the hood as clean as possible. 6. Keep experimental apparatus away from the edge of the hood - at least four (4) inches beh ind the face of the hood, and well away from the back (blocking the baffles will disturb the airflow pattern.) 7. Position the sash appropriately to ensure a minimum face velocity of 80 - 100 feet per minute (fpm). Reducing the open face will increase the face velocity , plus provide protection to the user. Keep the sash as low as possible. Keep your head outside the hood and keep the sash closed when the hood is not in use. 8. Try not to store chemicals in the hood - chemicals stored inside the hood distu rb the airflow pattern (especially when blocking baffles), and reduce the available working space. Evaporation of chemical waste up the fume hood is an illegal form of hazardous waste disposal. All hazardous waste containers in a hood should be kept sealed , unless they are actively being poured into. 9. Do not use perchloric acid in laboratory fume hoods. Perchloric acid must only be used in hoods designed especially for it. Perchloric acid, especially when heated and volatized, can form shock sensitive metal perchlorates in metal duct work. Contact the Office of Environmental Health and Safety for proper perchloric acid usage procedures. 34 E. DISTILLATION PROCEDURES Performi ng a distillation is a common procedure in laboratories. But the fact that it is common, means that people tend to overlook the inherent hazards. I n order to keep distillations safe, the following rules should be followed: 1. Always use either round -bottomed flasks or kettles of Pyrex supported with a tripod or bench jack, with a neck clamp for added security. To prevent an over -violent reaction, place boiling chips or an ebullator in the distillation flask or bottle. 2. Provide a vent in every distillation system and check to see that it does not become plugged. Otherwise, an explosion may occur. 3. Before starting a distillation process, check all joints and connections to see that they are greased and tight. Secure glass joints with wire or c lamps to prevent vapor leakage. Be certain that the coolant is flowing and that a receiver of adequate capacity is in place. 4. Perform all flammable liquid distillations, extractions, and washing operations in a fume hood. Use an electric heating mantel or a water or steam bath for heating - never use an open flame or hot plate. Before distilling ethers or acetal, or any peroxidizable compound, ensure no peroxides are present. Distillation will concentrate any peroxides present. See Appendices A and G. Always consult a material's SDS before performing a distillation. 5. When distillations are performed under reduced pressure, inert gas should be introduced by an ebullator. On vacuum stills, be certain that the contents of the system have cooled below t he boiling point before releasing the vacuum. 6. Avoid overheating still bottoms at end of distillation. When stopping a distillation, first shut off the heat. Turn off the coolant only after all vapors disappear from the condenser. 7. Wear the appropr iate PPE, when performing distillations. This includes a flame -resista nt lab coat, chemical splash gog gles and the appropriate chemically resistant gloves. Taken from the M.I.T. Accident Prevention Guide, Vol. 4 35 F. ELECTRICAL SAFETY 1. All electrical connections should be grounded. DO NOT REMOVE A GROUNDING PIN FROM AN ELECTRICAL CORD. 2. Electrical equipment service cords should be in good condition. Frayed cords or exposed wires should be repaired by qualified personnel , as soon as t hey are detected. Control switches and thermostats should also be in good working order. Special attention should be paid to cables from the power supply to the gels in the gel electrophoresis equipment. These cables must be in good condition, otherwise t here is potential for electric shock. Check the cables periodically, and replace when they are worn. 3. Avoid overloading circuits. Do not use multiple outlet plugs for additional connections. Approved UL listed power strips should be used in place of ex tension cords or multiple outlet plugs. 4. Do not handle any electrical connections with wet hands or when standing in or near water. The placement of connections should be such that there is no danger or chemical or water spillage on wires or equipment. Do not allow electrical cords to drape down into the troughs between lab benches (as in the Biology building), as they often have water running through them. 5. Do not use electrical equipment, such as mixers or hotplates, around flammable liquids. 6. Do not try to repair equipment yourself. All repairs should be done by qualified personnel. 7. Never try to bypass any safety device on a piece of electrical equipment. 8. In case of fire on or near any electrical equipment, pull building fire alarm box and if possible, dial 911 or 518 42 -3131 using your cell phone or 9-911 on the East Campus . 9. Use only BC or ABC fire extinguishers for fires on or near any electrical equipment. 10. Temporary electrical connections should be carefully placed - they sho uld not be run across the floor without protective covering nor left hanging overhead. Temporary connections should not take the place of installing permanent connection s. Heavy items should not be placed on top of electrical cords. 11. Do NOT store flammable materials or volatile liquids in refrigerators/freezers that are not labeled by the manufacturer as being explosion proof and for the storage of flammable materials . For electr ical assistance, contact Customer Service at 518 442-3480. 36 ELECTRICAL SAFETY (Cont'd.) IN THE EVENT OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK: 1. Do not touch victim until victim is out of contact with live current. 2. Unplug or turn off current or circuit breaker, if possible. 3. Immediately call 911 or 518 442 -3131 on your cell phone or if on the Health Sciences/ East Campus, dial 9 -911. State that you have a possible electrocution and request the Fire Department and Medical Assistance. 4. Follow Medical Emergency Procedures. 37 G.

No chemical, drug, compressed gas or biohazardous material shall be brought onto University at Albany campuses, either by being shipped through a commercial carrier or transferred by vehicle, without the express approval of EH&S. If the chemical, drug, compressed gas, biohazardous material is purchased through the University's Purchasing Department , then EH&S is already approving the purchase of the item before it is ordered. This is done electronically through Purchasing, once the order has been placed. See Appendix T for the Policy on the Transferring of Hazardous Materials or Equipment at the University at Albany. 9. No chemicals, compressed gases, drugs or biohazardous materials can be purchased with a state procurement card. Consultation with the above bodies may be appropriate to ensure that the toxic material can be approved for purchase, effectively contained during the experiments, the appropriate safety protocols are established and that the waste material can be and is d isposed of in a safe and legal manner. See page 6 of this Plan . 38 H. RESPIRATORY PROTECTION Respiratory protective equipment should not be used as a substitute for adequate exhaust ventilation or other engineering control methods. But when it is clearly impractical to remove harmful dusts, fumes, mists, vapors, or gases at their source, or when emergency protection against occasional and brief exposure is needed, people should have respiratory protective equipment available and should be trained on how to use it. There are several types of situations for which respiratory protection should be used: a) oxygen deficient atmospheres; b) gaseous toxic contaminant is present; c) particulate toxic contaminant is present; d) both particulate and gaseous toxic contaminants are present; e) nuisance dusts; f) gaseous contaminant is present below toxic levels. There are a variety of respirators available and each has a particular appli cation. For example, a dust/mist respirator is not effective where a toxic gas or an oxygen deficient atmosphere is present. Therefore, it is important to understand the hazardous situation and to choose suitable respiratory protective equipment. The University has a written Respiratory Protection Program , available on the EH&S web site, managed by the Office of Environment al Health and Safety. The Program involves medical exams, training, and the proper selection and fitting of respirators. If you need a respirator, contact the EH&S Office in Chem istry B72 . Medical approval by a doctor is required before an employee or student can wear a respirator, as respirators put a strain on an individual's respiratory and cardio -vascular system. The EH&S Offi R espiratory Prote ction Program , will make arrangements for this medical approval. The types of respirators currently available at the University include the following: Chemical Cartridge Respirators These consist of a half or full facepiece connected directly to cartr idge filters. Air contaminated by a toxic gas or vapor is purified by the chemicals in the cartridges. The length of time that a chemical cartridge respiratory provides protection depends upon the type of cartridge, the concentration of the gas o r vapor, and the activity of the user. The respirator offers resistance to breathing. Particulate Filter Respirators These consist of a half or full facepiece either with particulate filters attached or the respirator itself may be made out of th e filter material. The filter removes toxic particulates but offers resistance to breathing. 39 RESPIRATORY PROTECTION (Cont'd.) Combination Respirators These respirators offer protection against both particulate and gaseous contaminants but present breathing resistance. If Departments suspect that a situati on exists in their laboratories that require either the emergency or routine use of respiratory protection, they should contact the Office of Environmental Health and Safety for an evaluation of the need for respirators and the type to be used. Departments may request respirators from the Office of Environmental Health and Safety to be used on a short-term or emergency basis. If the need for respirators is expected to be long -term, Departments should consider purchasing respirators, on the advice and approval of the Office of Environmental Health and Safety. In either case, respirators should be avai lable at all times to the people who work in hazardous locations or situations where respiratory protection is required. Only people who have gone through the University's Respiratory Protection Program will be allowed to use them.

MEDICAL CONSULTATION AND MEDICAL EXAMS Any laboratory personnel who works with hazardous chemicals has the right to receive medical attention, including any follow -up examination which the examining physician determines to be necessary, under the following circumstances: 1. Whenever a lab work er develops signs or symptoms associated with a hazardous chemical to which they were exposed to in the laboratory. A material's SDS is a good place to start for signs and symptoms of overexposure to a particular material . Some signs and s ymptoms of overe xposure to a chemical may include , but are not limited to , irritation, coughing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, excessive tearing, blurred vision, excessive sweating, excessive salivation, stomach cramps, diarrhea, rash, itching, pupil dilation, pupil contraction, confusion, slurred speech, hyperactivity, dry mouth, rapid breathing, slow breathing, rapid heartbeat, slow heartbeat, chemical smelling breath, chest pain, blurred vision, choking, redness, etc. See the Table below. 2. When exposure monitoring reveals an exposure level routinely above the action level or the permissible exposure level (PEL), where no action level exists. See Appendix C. 3. Whenever an event takes place in the work area such as a spill, leak, explosion, or other occurrence resulting in the likelihood of a hazardous exposure. 4. Whenever an employee is required to wear a respirator as part of their job duties. See H. Respiratory Protection above. Please contact the Office of Environmental He alth and Safety at 518 442 -3495 for assistance in any of the above circumstances, for assistance in setting up a medical consultation , and/or a medical exam. General toxicity categories Category System affected Common symptoms respiratory nose, trachea, lungs irritation, coughing, choking, tight chest gastrointestinal stomach, intestines nausea, vomiting, diarrhea renal kidney back pain, urinating more or less than usual neurological brain, spinal cord headache, dizziness, behavior confusion, depression, coma, convulsions hematological blood anemia (tiredness, weakness) dermatological skin, eyes rashes, itching, redness, swelling reproductive ovaries, testes, fetus infertility, miscarriage 41 J.

HO W TO READ AND UNDERSTAND A SDS OSHA QUICK CARD HAZARD COMMUNICATIONS SAFETY DATA SHEETS The Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) requires chemical manufacturers, distributors, or importers to provide Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) (formerly known as Material Safety Data Sheets or MSDSs) to communicate the hazards of hazardous chemical products. The HCS requir es new SDSs to be in a uniform format, and include the section numbers, the headings, and associated information under the headings below: Section 1, Identification includes product identifier; manufacturer or distributor name, address, phone number; emerg ency phone number; recommended use; restrictions on use. Section 2, Hazard(s) identification includes all hazards regarding the chemical; required label elements. Section 3, Composition/information on ingredients includes information on chemical ingredient s; trade secret claims. Section 4, First -aid measures includes important symp toms/effects, acute, delayed; required treatment. Section 5, Fire -fighting measures lists suitable extinguishing techniques, equipment; chemical hazards from fire. Section 6, Ac cidental release measures lists emergency procedures; protective equipment; proper methods of containment and cleanup. Section 7, Handling and storage lists precautions for safe handling and storage, including incompatibilities Section 8, Exposure controls/personal protection lists OSHA's Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs); ACGIH Threshold Limit Values (TLVs); and any other exposure limit used or recommended by the chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer preparing the SDS wh ere available as well as appropriate engineering controls; personal protective equipment (PPE). Section 9, Physical and chemical properties lists the chemical's characteristics. Section 10, Stability and reactivity lists chemical stability and possibilit y of hazardous reactions. Section 11, Toxicological information includes routes of exposure; related symptoms, acute and chronic effects; numerical measures of toxicity. Section 12, Ecological information* Section 13, Disposal considerations* Section 14, Transport information* Section 15, Regulatory information* Section 16, Other information , includes the date of preparation or last revision *Note: Since other Agencies regulate this information, OSHA wil l not be enforcing Sections 12 through 15 (29 CFR 1910.1200(g)(2)). Employers must ensure that SDSs are readily accessible to employees. See Appendix D of 29 CFR 1910.1200 for a detailed description of SDS contents. 44 Remember the physical hazards of a chemical are just as important as its health hazards. For more information, see the links below. https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3514.html https://sites.ewu.edu/ehs/files/2017/06/Flin or to the material's manufacturer's web site. Sigma -Aldrich has a great SDS database for their products. https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/united -states.html Each lab should have a current chemical inventory with the accompanying SDS s available in either hard copies or on a database easily accessible to all lab members. This database should be backed up on an USB drive and stored in a safe, secure location, preferably outside the lab to use in the event of an emergency. 45 B. TOXIC CHEMICALS A toxic chemical is one that has the potential for injuring the human body or its systems by direct chemical action. Almost any substance is toxic when taken in excess of \"tolerable\" limits. See Appendix C. A person may be exposed to a toxic chemical in a number of different ways. The four PRIMARY ROUTES OF ENTRY are: 1. Absorption - Direct chemical contact with the skin or eyes is the most common type of chemical exposure. The substance can enter the blood stream through the outer layers of the skin, contact with eyes, through hair follicles, or surface openings from cuts and bruises. 2. Inhalation - Inhalation of chemicals into the respiratory passages and lungs. 3. Ingestion - Ingestion of chemicals eith er directly or indirectly by contamination of hands, food, or drink. 4. Injection - Injection of the chemicals into the body through syringes, puncture wounds, or broken glassware. The effects of the toxic chemical may be local or systemi c, acute or chronic. Knowing what these term s mean is useful and can be found on the chemical's Safety Data Sheet (SDS) . Local Toxicity The effect a substance has on the body tissues directly exposed to it. For example, an acid exhibits local toxicity because it can cause burns of the skin, eyes, mouth, or stomach, if it comes in contact with them and can cause irritation of the respiratory tract. Systemic Toxicity The effect a substance has on body tissues after it has bee n absorbed into the bloodstream. For example, mercury exhibits systemic toxicity because it effects the brain, kidneys, gums, and teeth after it has been inhaled or ingested. Acute Effect Short term exposure. A single dose in which the body's ability to protect itself is overcome by the substance. Acute exposures are usually reversed over a period of time. Benzene is an example of a substance with an acute toxic effect, causing irritat ion of skin and eyes and narcosis. Chronic Effect Long term exposure. Chronic effect is defined as l ow level exposure over a long period of time in which the rate of exposure is greater than the body's ability to protect it self. Chronic effects often do not appear until years later. Benzene also exhibits chronic toxic ity, producing severe anemia and possibly cancer. * REMEMBER THE PHYSICAL HAZARDS OF A CHEMICAL ARE JUST AS I MPORTANT AS KNOWING THE HEALTH HAZARDS OF A CHEMICAL. Always consult a chemical's SDS before using that chemical for the first time. Signs and symptoms of o verexposu re are found on the chemical's SDS. 46 C. GHS CATEGORIES OF RELATIVE TOXICITY OF CHEMICALS AND ASSOCIATED SIGNAL WORDS GHS Acute Toxicity Criteria Five GHS categories have been included in the GHS Acute Toxicity scheme from which the appropriate elements relevant to transport, consumer, worker and environment protection can be selecte d. Substances are assigned to one of the five toxicity categories on the basis of LD 50 (oral, dermal) or LC 50 (inhalation). The LC 50 values are based on 4 -hour tests in animals. The GHS provides guidance on converting 1 -hour inhalation test results to a 4 -hour equivalent. The five categories are shown in the Table - Acute Toxicity. Acute Toxicity Acute toxicity Cat. 1 Cat. 2 Cat. 3 Cat. 4 Category 5 Oral (mg/kg) 5 > 5 50 > 50 300 > 300 2000 Criteria: Anticipated oral LD50 between 2000 and 5000 mg/kg; Indication of significant effect in humans;* Any mortality at class 4;* Significant clinical signs at class 4;* Indications from other studies.* *If assignment to more hazardous class is not warranted. Dermal (mg/kg) 50 > 50 200 > 200 1000 > 1000 2000 Gases (ppm) 100 > 100 500 > 500 2500 > 2500 5000 Vapors (mg/l) 0.5 > 0.5 2.0 > 2.0 10 > 10 20 Dust & mists (mg/l) 0.05 > 0.05 0.5 > 0.5 1.0 > 1.0 5 Category 1, the most severe toxicity category, has cut-off values currently used primarily by the transport sector for classification for packing groups. Some Competent Authorities may consider combining Acute Categories 1 and 2. Category 5 is for chemicals which are of relatively low acute toxicity but wh ich, under certain circumstances, may pose a hazard to vulnerable populations. Criteria other than LD50/LC50 data are provided to identify substances in Category 5 unless a more hazardous class is warranted. GHS Signal Words - found on GHS Labels and Safe ty Data Sheets (SDSs) The signal word indicates the relative degree of severity a hazard. The signal words used in the GHS are \"Danger\" for the more severe hazards, and \"Warning\" for the less severe hazards. Signal words are standardized and assigned to th e hazard categories within endpoints. Some lower level hazard categories do not use signal words. Only one signal word corresponding to the class of the most severe hazard should be used on a label. For more information on GHS go to https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghsguideoct05.pdf 47 D. PEL'S AND TLV'S PEL (Permissible Exposure Limit) and TLV (Threshold Limit Value) are standards or guidelines that establish certain levels of a substance to which nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed, day after day, without adverse effects. PEL's are legal standards, established by OSHA, while TLV's are guidelines recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). These exposure limits, expressed in parts per million (ppm) or milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3 ), are based on a time weighted average for an 8 hour day/40 hour work week. These limit s can be found on a chemical's Safety Data Sheet (SDS) . The i mportant thing to remember about PEL's and TLV's is that the lower the number, the more dangerous the substance. (F or a listing of some PEL's, see Appendix C.) Before using a chemical, the researcher should be familiar with the hazards of the chemical. Th is information is most readily obtained from the chemical's l abel and the manufacturer's SDS. The chemical label is provided by the manufacturer with: a) information on the type of hazard a chemical presents, whether toxic, flammable, explosive, oxidizi ng, corrosive, or some other hazard; b) a GHS signal word indicati ng the relative hazard, DANGER or WARNING c) instructions on how to use the chemical safely; and d) instructions on emergency measures, such as first aid, firefighting, and spill cleanu p. After becoming familiar with the properties of a toxic chemical, the researcher should plan his or her experiment to include protective clothing and equipment, special laboratory practices, and procedures for emergencies. The Office of Environmental He alth and Safety in Chemistry B72 is available to help researchers evaluate their exposure to toxic chemicals. Good sources of information on toxic chemicals, b esides the SDS, are: Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials , edited by N . Irving Sax; Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances , offered by NIOSH; and Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents ; by ACGIH. 48 V. SAFE CHEMICAL STORAGE 49 A. CHEMICAL STORAGE GUIDELINES: IN RELATION TO NEW YORK STATE FIRE CODE REQUIREMENTS There is no easy ABC solution to the problems associated with the storage of chemicals, including flammable and combustible liquids. The basic approach is to limit the amount of f lammable liquids to reduce the risk of accidents, and more importantly, to reduce the consequences of accidents. Reducing the quantity of flammable solvents to the limits set by fire codes will enhance overall laboratory safety and minimize the risks of ma jor fires and/or injuries. In essence, the storage of flammable or combustible liquids are to be limited to amounts needed for the day to day operation of the labs. Laboratories were not designed or intended to be long term storage areas for large quantit ies of solvents. The storage of solvents for convenience unnecessarily increases the risk of accidents with severe consequences. 1. Maximum storage of flammable and combustible liquids shall not exceed 120 gallons (45 liters) inside a flammable storage cabin et. 2. The maximum number of flammable storage cabinets within a maintained fire area is three (3). A fire area is defined as a room or rooms separated from other rooms and corridors by a fire rated enclosure with opening protectives (doors, vents, slide up doors), which must self -close and latch. The fire area shall not exceed 5000 sq. ft. 3. Flammable and combustible liquids will not be stored in/or block egress from any lab or storage area. 4. The maximum amount of flammable liquids stored outside of an appro ved storage cabinet is 35 gallons/132.5 liters. Of these 35 gallons, 25 gallons/95 liters must be in safety cans; the remaining 10 gallons/38 liters may be in other permissible containers. 5. No safety can shall exceed 2 gallons/8 liters in instructional (undergraduate) labs. 5 gallon/18.9 liter safety cans may be used in any other lab using chemicals. 55 gal. drums of solvent for use in labs are prohibited from being purchased. 6. Solve nts with a flash point (refer to SDS) of 10 0\u00b0F or less shall not be transferred between metal containers , unless the containers are electrically bonded to a ground source. 7. These solvents are commonly stored in laboratories in excessive quantities. This practice m ust be controlled. nonflammable) Hydrocarbons 50 CHEMICAL STORAGE GUIDELINES (Cont'd.) 8. Incompatible chemicals shall be physically separate d to prevent accidental contact. Examples: Acids & Bases Acids & Solvents Organics & Inorganics Water Sensitive Chemicals Oxidizing Agents & Organics Oxidizing Agents & Flammables Organic Acids & Inorganic Acids Oxidizing Agents & Reducing Agents Oxidizing Agents & Dehydrating Agents 9. Containers of materials that may become hazardous upon prolonged storage should be dated when first opened. At six month intervals, the chemicals shall be evaluated or test ed for continued safe use (i.e., peroxides). 10. One way to achieve safe storage of chemicals is to adopt a method suggested by the chemical manufacturers. For example, Fisher Scientific uses color -coding to signify groups of chemicals, which may be stored together. Whether the color code is used or not, the main idea is the separation of incompatible chemicals. Attached is a list of commonly used chemicals gro uped together as compatibles. It follows that the chemicals within the group shall not be stored with chemicals within another group due to possible unfavorable reactions. 11. COMPRESSED OR LIQUIFIED GASES - Only gas cylinders necessary for current lab re quirements shall be in the lab. All Gas cylinders shall be securely restrained to prevent falling over, whether empty or full. Also, all gas cylinders must have valve caps in place when not being used, if appropriate. Regulators should be removed and va lve caps put back on any gas cylinder not being used again within one week. Cylinder contents, which create a health hazard (such a s neurotoxins, poisons, etc.), shall be stored so that they will not contaminate breathing air. 51 CHEMICAL STORAG E GUIDELINES (Cont'd.) This table shows the maximum allowable size of various containers for flammable and combustible liquids. Always consult the SDS for properties of the class of liquid being used.

Empty containers will be properly disposed of and shall not be allowed to be stored. 7. All containers will be properly labeled as to their content. If the contents are changed, the labels must also be changed. However, this is not recommended since the chance of mixing inter -reactive materials is substantially increased. ____________________________________ NOT E: Above excerpts are from NFPA 45 - \"LAB ORATORIES USING CHEMICALS\" Code and Fire Code, State of New York. OF NOTE, EMPTY GAS CYLINDERS ARE STILL CONSIDERED HAZARDOUS AND MUST BE DISPOSED OF PROPERLY. NEVER PUT A GAS CYLINDER IN THE REGULAR TRASH . CONTACT EH &S FOR PROPER DISPOSAL PROCEDURE S. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO NON -EMPTY AEROSOL CANS. 56 B. STORAGE OF CHEMICALS 1. DO NOT OVERSTOCK CHEMICALS. 2. KEEP QUANTITIES OF ALL CHEMICAL MATERIALS TO A MINIMUM. 3. Purchase ONLY the smallest quantity necessary to complete your experiment and/or research project. 4. Storage Conditions - Flammable liquids must be stored in flammable storage cabinets or explosion - proof refrigerators, if refrigeration storage is necessary. Eliminate all ignition sources (flame, heat from radiators, etc.) from storage area or locate storage area away from fire hazards. See Section V.F. 5. Chemicals should be stored with labels facing ou t, in metal cabinets or on secured, level metal shelves (excluding perchloric acid). No storage on the floor or hig her than eye/face level is allowe d. Large containers should be stored towards the back and bottom of shelves. Keep chemicals away from shelf and counter top edges. If possible, shelves where chemicals are being stored should have protective edges to preve nt chemicals from falling off. DO NOT STORE IMCOMPATIBLE CHEMICALS TOGETHE R. See Sections V. C., D., E. 6. Containers of perchloric acid should be kept on trays of glass, ceramic, or polyethylene materials of sufficient capacity to hold all of the acid in case containers should leak. Perchloric acid forms a contact explosive when in contact with metals. In general, acids should be stored on trays (polyethylene) with sufficient capacity to hold a leaking container's contents. Please consult with EH &S bef ore using perchloric acid. 7. Store dichromate cleaning solutions in cool areas, away from other chemicals. Keep the bottle caps slightly loosened. See Appendix C. 8. Fume hoods should not be used as a storage area. Chemicals stored in a fume hood interf ere with the hood's proper airflow. 9. Keep caps and lids of chemical containers closed when not in use as this prevents contamination and vapor escape. 10. Ethers should be stored in dark, cool, well -ventilated storage areas. Ethers with low flash point s should be stored in an approved explosion -proof refrigerator. Be aware of which chemicals form organic peroxides use them up or dispose of them before t hey become a physical hazard. See Appendix G. 11. DO NOT USE THE FLOOR FOR STORAGE. DO NOT STORE CH EMICALS OVERHEAD. 12. POISONS AND DRUGS MUST ONLY BE STORED IN LOCKED CABINETS. 13. Consult a chemical's SDS for proper storage information. Review the chemical's physical and health hazards for proper storage information. 57 C.

CARCINOGENS Specific regulations have been established by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regarding the handling of certain comp ounds classified as carcinogens or potential carcinogens by the National Toxicity Program (NTP). Anyone contemplating work o r who are working with materials on this list should consult the Environmental Health & Safety Office in Chemistry B72 for the regulations, necessary approvals, training, working conditions, monitoring, record keeping and medical surveillance. The Federal Government has issued very detailed regulations for the chemicals listed below. Go to the OSHA website with the link below, then look under General Industry (29 CFR 1910) for more information. https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/carcinogens/standards.html Any laboratory personnel who use or handle any of these chemicals should contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safety for detailed information: 2-Acetylaminofluorene Acrylonitrile 4-Aminodiphenyl Asbestos Benzene Benzidine Chloride It is imperative that the SDS be consulted before using any chemical. 65 B. PROCEDU RES FOR USING COMPRESSED GASES Compressed gases are defined by the U.S. Department of Transportation as any material or mixtures having in the container either an absolute pressure exceeding 40 psi at 2 0\u00b0C (70\u00b0F) or an absolute pressure exceeding 104 psi at 54. 4\u00b0C (13 0\u00b0F), or both; or a ny liquid flammable material having a Reid vapor pressure exceeding 40 psi at 37. 8\u00b0C (10 0\u00b0F). For the purposes of safety, all volatile materials and mixtures packaged in cylinders should be considered compressed gases. The use of compressed gases may give rise to the following hazards: 1. Equipment failure and/or leakage may occur, resulting in the diffusion of gases and contamination of the atmosphere. This contamination can cause toxic or anesthetic effects, asphyxiation, or explosive concentrations of flammable gases. 2. The flash point of a flammable gas under pressure is always lower than ambient or room temperature; thus, leaking gas can rapidly form an explosive mixture with air. 3. Upon rapid expansion, low -boiling point materials can cause frost bite on contact with living tissue. 4. Some compressed gases are corrosive, irritating, or reactive. 5. A compressed gas cylinder without a protective cylinder valve cap may release its contents with great force when dropped. If a cylinder is punctured, it may also release its contents with great force. Cylinders have been propelled through walls and roofs. Because of these hazards, precautions need to be taken in the handling, storage, and use of compressed gas cylinders. RULES FOR HANDLING COMPRESSED GASES 1. When cylinders are received, they should be inspected to determine if: a. cylinder valve protection caps are in place; b. cylinder and valves are in serviceable condition and show no corrosion. 2. Always use a cylinder hand truck for transport. If transporting compressed gases in a vehicle, contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safety for instructions . Personal vehicles should never be used to transport compressed gases or chemicals to be use d at the University of Albany. 3. ALL Cylinders should be individually chained or otherwise secured in an upright position at all times. Use cylinders in an upright position only. Securing brackets and straps are available for sale in CAS Sci entific Stores. 4. Do not drop cylinders, full or empty, or permit them to fall against each other. 66 PROCEDURES FOR USING COMPRESSED GASES (Cont'd.) 5. Leave cylinder valve caps on cylinders until secured and ready for use. 6. All valves should b e closed when not in use. 7. Regulators must be used to control pressures to operating requirements. Use the proper regulator for the particular gas. Never force a regulator onto a compressed gas cylinder . Only materials recommended for the particular gas service involved shall be used in piping, fittings or equipment. Regulators should be removed from a compressed gas cylinder if the gas will not be used again within a week. 8. Always consider cylinders to be full and handle accordingly. 9. The cylinders of nonliquified gases should be considered empty w hile positive pressure (25 psig or greater) still remains in order to prevent suck back and contamination. 10. Cylinders containing liquified gases should never be completely emptied in order to prevent suck back and contamination. 11. Oxidizers must not be used in contact with oils, grease or other hydrocarbons. 12. Flammables must not be exposed to f lames, sparks or arcs including static electricity, hot surfaces or oxidizers. Bond and ground all cylinders and piping containing flammable gases to prevent the hazards caused by the buildup of static electricity. 13. Nonflammables must not be al lowed to displace air in confined workspaces so that there is not sufficient oxygen for breathing. 14. When corrosive gases are being used, the cylinder valve stem should be worked frequently to prevent freezing. 15. Highly toxic gases or pyropho ric gases require special handling. Prior approval must be gotten from the Office of Environmental Health and Safety before using these gases. Safe handling protocols including emergency response procedures must be written by the lab, with consultati on from the Environmental Health and Safety Office, when using these gases. These gases may require the use of vented gas handling cabinets with emergency shutoffs and gas detection monitors with alarms. See Appendix Y - Toxic Gas Fact Sheet and Program. 16. Contact the Environmental Health and Safety Office at 518 442-3495 for proper disposal ins tructions for compressed gas cylinders that are no lon ger wanted or that are empty. Compressed gas cylinders cannot be thrown in the regular trash when empty, as they are still considered a hazardous material and may have to be dispose d of as hazardous waste. Every effort should be made to return the empty compressed gas cylinder to the manufacturer, as disposing of compressed gas cylinders as hazardous waste is extremely expensive. This includes lecture size gas cylinde rs and the non -usable gas cylinders. 17. All non -empty aerosol cans are considered hazardous waste. If there is still product in the can, even if you can't remove it, the aerosol can't go in the regular trash and must be given to the EH&S Office as hazardous waste. Safety devices are available to prevent suck back and relieve sudden pressure increases . 67 PROCEDURES FOR USING COMPRESS ED GASES (Cont'd.) STORING COMPRESSED GASES: 1. Store cylinders in a fire -resistant, cool, dry, and adequately ventilated area. Rust will damage cylinders and will often cause the valve caps to stick. Cylinders should be adequately secured in an upright position (so that they can't fall over) while being stored. 2. The storage area should not contain any sources of ignition. 3. Storage area temperature should not exceed 10 0\u00b0F. 4. Floor should be level. 5. Floor should be designed to protect cylinders from dampness. 6. Cylinders should be protected from weather extremes and direct sunlight. 7. Store gases supporting combustion (O 2, Cl2, etc.) at least 25 feet from fuel gases, preferably in another storage area. 8. Highly toxic gases and pyrophoric gases may require storage in vented gas handling cabinets along with emergency shutoffs and gas detection monitors and alarms. See Appendix Y on Toxic Gas Fact Sheet and Program. 68 HAZARD DATA FOR COMMON COMPRESSED GASES GAS Threshold Limit Values (ppm)Flammability Limits in Air (Percent by Volume)Major Hazards Acetylene Not established (nontoxic, produces anesthetic effects)2.5-81.0 Flammable; asphyxiant Ammonia 50 15 - 28 Toxic Argon Not established (nontoxic) None Asphyxiant Boron trifluoride 1 None Toxic; causes burns 1,3-Butadiene 1000 2 - 11.5 Flammable; skin irritant Butane Not established (nontoxic produces anesthetic effects)1.9 - 8.5 Flammable Carbon dioxide 5000 None Asphyxiant Carbon monoxide 50 12.5 - 74.0 Flammable; toxic Chlorine 1 NoneToxic; severe irritant; causes burns; corrosive Ethane Not established (nontoxic produces anesthetic effects)3.0 - 12.5 Flammable; asphyxiant Ethylene anesthetic effects)31. - Flammable; asphyxiant Ethylene oxide 50 3.0 - 100.0Flammable; toxic; can cause burns when trapped by clothing or shoes Helium Not established (nontoxic) None Asphyxiant Hydrogen Not established (nontoxic) 4.0 - 75.0 Flammable; asphyxiant bromide 3 chloride 5 None Toxic; causes burns; corrosive Hydrogen fluoride 3 NoneToxic; causes severe slow healing burns; corrosive Hydrogen sulfide 10 4.3 - 45.0 Toxic; flammable; Methane (nontoxic) 5.3 - Flammable; asphyxiant Methyl bromide 20 13.5 - 14.5 Toxic; causes burns Methyl chloride 100 10.7 - 17.4 Toxic; flammable Methyl mercaptan 0.5 Unknown Toxic; flammable Nitrogen Not established (nontoxic) None Asphyxiant Nitrogen dioxide 5 None Toxic; corrosive Oxygen Nontoxic None Highly reactive Phosgene 0.1 None Toxic Propane Not established (nontoxic produces anesthetic effects)2.2 - 9.5 Flammable; asphyxiant Sulfur dioxide 5 None causes burns Vinyl chloride 500 4.0 - 22.0 Flammable; causes burns Source: Manufacturing Chemists Association, Guide for Safety in the Chemical Laboratory (New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, 1972).

OTHER TIPS FOR SAFE HANDLING OF COMPRESSED GASES: 1. Oily (not specially cleaned) fittings should never be used with oxygen. Oxygen under pressure will rapidly oxidize oil or grease a nd result in an explosion. Equipment specifically \"cleaned for oxygen servic e\" must be used. 2. Acetylene can explode if not properly regulated. An automatic pressure regulator is the only type of recommended control. Acetylene can explode with extrem e violence if ignited. It can also form explosive compounds in contact with copper or brass. 3. Regulators can leak and build pressure within a closed gas delivery system. A pressure relief device should be employed. A trap should be inserted in outlet lines to prevent liquid from flowing back into the cylinders. 4. Open the cylinder valve only after connecting the regulator to the cylinder using a proper CGA* regulator. 5. Only equipment suitable for pressures involved can be used with high p ressure gases. The pressure ratings for all containers and hardware must be known and equipment must not be used where limits will be exceeded. Glass equipment should not be pressurized. A general rule is: do not apply pressure greater than ten (10 ) inches of water, if you are not wearing protective equipment. 6. Never mix gases in a cylinder. Explosion, contamination, corrosion, and other hazards can result. Never try to refill gas cylinders or transfer gas from one cylinder to another. 7. To prevent corrosion, regulators, valves, and fittings used in compressed gas systems, which conduct corrosive gases, should be flushed with nitrogen or dry air after ea ch use. 8. Corrosive gases should be stored for the shortest possible time period, preferably under three months. They cylinder valve stem of corrosive gases should be worked frequently to prevent freezing. 9. The cylinder valve cap should always be firmly in place when the cylinder is not in use. Empty cylinders must be returned with valve protection caps on. 10. Any system should be leak tested before it is used. To check for leaks, spread soap over all joints. They system is leaki ng if any bubbles appear. 11. The researcher is responsible for knowing the characteristics of the gases he/she uses: toxicity, flammability, compatibility with materials and other gases. Consult the gases' Safety Data Sheets . See page 68 - Hazard Data for Common Compressed Gases. 70 PROCEDURES FOR USING COMPRESSED GASES (Cont'd.) OTHER TIPS FOR SAFE HANDLING OF COMPRESSED GASES: 12. When disposing of empty cylinders, contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safety for disposal procedures. Empty cylinders DO NOT go in the trash. 13. If necessary, clean out the cylinder valve opening before connecting it to an oxygen regulator or a charging line. This can be done by briefly opening the cylinder valve. Do not stan d in front of the valve opening during such a \"blow ou t\", nor place your hand across it. A \"blow ou t\" must under no circumstances take place close to an open fire or any source of ignition, e.g., during welding. 14. When using regulators, always check tha t the adjustment screw has been turned far enough to allow it to move freely in its threads prior to opening the cylinder valve. With the adjustment screw in this position, the regulator is closed. 15. Never use pliers or a similar tool to open a cylinder valve. Some valves are opened with a special key and others are equipped with hand wheels. It is dangerous to force the valve open by knocking or heating. 16. Initials and stamps engraved on the cylinder shells must not be changed or obliterated. Labels and tags should not be removed. 17. Compressed Breathing Air must meet at least the requirements for Type 1 - Grade D breathing air, as described in ANSI/CGA G-7.1-1989 commodity specification for air. CGA: Compressed Gas Association 71 C. PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING CRYOGENICS The principal hazards posed by the use of cryogenic liquids and systems are burns from human contact with cryogens; pressure buildup in unvented spaces; and fires, explosions, and asphyxiation, which can result from the evaporation of cryogens. RULES FOR HANDLING CRYOGENICS 1. The appropriate eye and skin protection must be worn whenever cryogenic liquids are handled, to avoid splashes in the eyes and on the s kin. The gloves should be rated for cryogenic liquids. 2. Clothing or jewelry that can trap cryogenic liquids next to the skin should be avoided; for example, wristwatches, rings, etc. 3. In the event of a splash, imm ediately flood the areas and clothing affected with water. For prolonged exposures, seek medical treatment. 4. Cryogenic liquids are capable of causing asphyxiation by displacing the air necessary for the support of life, especially when they are used in a confined area. Therefore, they should be used only in well ventilated areas. Whenever transporting tanks of cryogenics that are venting in elevators, make sure another person is waiting for you to exit the elevator. This will insure that you ha ve someone available to summon help should the elevator break down and/or you are overcome by the over -venting of the gas. If at all possible, no one should ride in an elevator with a venting cryogenic tank. 5. Venting should be provided to avoid quick and violent pressure changes when cryofluids vaporize. 6. Exposed glass areas of glass dewars should be taped to prevent the spread of broken glass should the container implode. 7. Handle combustible cryogens such as liquid hydrogen and liquid natura l gas (LNG) in the same way combustible gases are handled; provide ventilation, keep away from open flames and other ignition sources, prohibit smoking, and discharge vent gases to a safe location. 8. Handle cryogenic storage containers carefully since they are fragile and expensive. See Appendix M for more information on the Safe Handling of Liquid Nitrogen. EH&S provides for online training on safe Liquid Nitrogen Handling on UAlbany's Blackboard. 72 D. PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING ETHERS AND PEROXIDIZABLE MATERIALS Ethers have toxic, flammable, and explosive properties and are dangerous, if not handled properly. They are widely used in laboratories on campus. The vapors, when inhaled, produce a depression of the central nervous system. The most common ethers, methyl and ethyl, are particularly dangerous fire hazards because of their low flash points. Th us, it is necessary to prohibit open flames, electrical sparks, heat sources, and oxidizing agents when they are being used. Ethers and other peroxidizable materials , such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran , can form explosive organic peroxides, especially af ter the container has been opened and stored for a length of time. Frequently, an inhibitor has been added by the manufacturer to retard the formation of peroxides, but peroxides may form nevertheless during storage even if the container has never been ope ned. The friction produced by the opening of a container with peroxide formation inside may be enough to detonate the peroxides and cause an explosion and subsequent injury. From the OSH Answers Fact Sheet - Organic Peroxides - Hazards \" Some chemicals can form explosive peroxides when they are stored (e.g., isopropyl ether, vinylidene chloride). Exposure to light and heat can increase the rate of peroxide formation. Others form peroxides that become hazardous when concentrated (e.g., by distillation). Some examples include ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), p -dioxane, some secondary 2 -butanol, and some unsaturated kind of peroxide -forming compound are unsaturated monomers that, in the presence of a peroxide, can polymerize exothermically (i.e., produces heat when it reacts). For example, uninhibited styrene can form a peroxide that can cause the styrene to polymeri ze. It can occur explosively under certain conditions. Other examples of some unsaturated monomeric compounds are acrylic acid, acrylonitrile, butadiene, methyl methacrylate, and vinyl chloride. To generalize, the kinds of chemicals that can form peroxide s include aldehydes, ethers, and numerous unsaturated hydrocarbon compounds (i.e. hydrocarbon compounds having double or triple bonds). Examples in this group include allyl compounds, Fact Sheet: http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/organic/organic_peroxide.ht ml 1. Ethers should always be handled in a fume hood. This will protect laboratory occupants from inhaling the vapors and will prevent explosive vapor concentrations from forming. 2. Ethers should be stored in flammable storage cabinets. Ethers with low flash points should be stored in explosion proof refrigerators. See Section V.F. 3. Ethers and peroxidizable materials should be ordered only in small quantities and must be dated upon receipt and when opened. USE ETHERS AND PEROXIDIZABLE MATERIALS UP PROMPTLY AFTER OPENING. See Appendix G. 4. DO NOT STORE ETHERS IN GROUND GLASS -STOPPERED BOTTLES. 73 PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING ETHERS AND PEROXIDIZABLE MATERIALS (Cont'd.) 5. Do not move or open any bottle or can of ether or any peroxidizable compound that has exceeded its expiration date or is of questionable age. If you find such a container, immediately contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safety in Chemistry B72, which will arrange for its proper disposal. See Appendix G for the Recognition and Handling of Peroxidizable Compounds. 6. Ethers and peroxidizable materials, once they have gone past their expiration date, are dangerous and are extremely expen sive to dispose of. A team of high hazard specialists has to be called in to handle the old peroxidizable material basically as a potential bomb. WATCH THE AGE OF YOUR PEROXIDIZABLE MATERIALS!!!!! Dispose of them as hazardous waste, once they hit the ir expiration date. 7. Any organic peroxides present in a peroxidizable compound will become concentrated when distilled or evaporated. Before any distillation of a peroxidizable compound, check first for the presence of organic peroxides . If peroxides are detected, consult with the P.I. before proceeding. Link to more information regarding https://www.uaf.edu/safety/industrial -hygiene/laboratory THE CHEMIC AL'S LABEL AND SDS FOR INFORMATION ON WHETHER IT FORMS PEROXIDES. 74 E. PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING MERCURY Mercury and mercury -containing compounds are highly toxic to humans. Poisoning may be produced by inhaling mercury vapor, fume or dust; it may also be produced by ingestion of mercury or absorption of mercury through the skin. Organic mercury compounds are extremely toxic. Acute mercury poisoning, caused by exposure to a high level of mercury over a short period of time, is accompanied by a metallic taste in the mouth, marked salivation, swelling of gums, vomiting, a nd bloody diarrhea. Consult SDS on symptoms of mercury exposure. Chronic mercury poisoning, caused by exposure to low levels of mercury over a long period of time, may show the same symptoms as seen in acute poisoning, but these are usually less pronounced and not always recognizable as poisoning. Chronic poisoning affects the nervous system, causing a marked tremor, unsteady gait, and personality changes . Organic mercury compounds are extremely toxic and can be absorbed through the skin with fatal results. Always consult a SDS before handling any mercury or mercury compound. Mercury is commonly used in labs in such items as thermometers, fluorescent lamps, manometers, recording instruments, batteries, and diffusion pumps. Exposure to mercury can arise in the following ways: 1. When a mercury spill occurs and is not cleaned up promptly or correctly, the mercury scatters into many droplets, thus increasing the surface area of the mercury and the rate of evaporation. The rate of evaporation may exceed the capacity of the room's ventilation to dilute it. If you accidentally spill mercury, contact the Office of Environmenta l Health and Safety for assistance in cleaning up the spill. The Office supplies mercury spill kits for small spills. See the following page. 2. When mercury is used in elevated temperatures, it evaporates quickly. A common occurrence is the breaking of thermometers in ovens by bumping or by raising the oven temperature above the thermometer's capacity, resulting in high levels of mercury vapor. 3. In systems where mercury is under pressure and ruptures may occur, mercury can impact at high veloci ties. This atomizes the mercury, which could result in high levels of mercury vapor being released, should a rupture occur in the system. 4. Mercury and mercury contaminated materials are considered hazardous wastes by the EPA and must be disposed of as such. See Section VII - Hazardous Waste Disposal Procedures. 5. The University at Albany is in the process of trying to go to a mercury free environment whenever possible. The Environmental Health and Safety Office will replace mercury thermometer s with mercury free thermometers, free of charge, whenever possible. Contact EH&S at 518 442-3495 for details. 6. All fluorescent tubes, thermostats, computer monitors and batteries, because of their mercury, lead or heavy metal content , are NOT to g o out in the trash and are regulated by NYS DEC and U.S. EPA as Universal Waste. Contact the Environmental Health and Safety Office for disposal procedures. See Appendix N - Universal Waste Disposal Policy and Guidelines plus Electronics Recycling. 75 PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING MERCURY (Cont'd.) GUIDELINES FOR HANDLING MERCURY 1. Place a tray or other container under all mercury sources to contain any spills that may occur. If a spill should occur, clean it up promptly and properly , wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment. The Office of Environmental Health and Safety has merc ury spill kits available for free that enable a n individual to clean up a mercury spill safely. To clean up a mercury spill: a. Pick up all visible mercury by gentle sweeping and a trapped vacuum line attached to a tapered glass tube or needle -nose pipette. Avoid scattering or breaking up the mercury droplets. b. Spread a mercury -spill kit product over the affected area to pick up any microscopic droplets that may remain; sweep up the waste and dispose of as a hazardous waste. Mercury \"sponges\" may also be used. These spill cleanup items are available through the O ffice of Environmental Health & Safety in Chemistry B 72. c. Call the Of fice of Environmental Health and Safety at 518 442-3495 , so that the room can be surveyed for persistent mercury contamination. d. Do not use a broom or an ordinary vacuum cleaner to clean up the spill. They will only scatter the droplets further. The Office of Environmental Health & Safety has a mercury vacu um cleaner designed specifically to clean up mercury spills. 3. Store mercury in unbreakable plastic bottles. Keep containers sealed in a cool, well ventilated area. 4. Use mercury only in a well ventilated area. Practice good housekeeping to prevent spi lled mercury from accumulating. 5. Always wear personal protective equipment when handling mercury, especially protective gloves and goggles, as mercury is an inhalation and skin absorption hazard. N ever eat, drink or smoke where mercury is being use d. 6. Organic mercury compounds are extremely toxic and can be absorbed through the skin with fatal results . Always consult a SDS before handling any mercury or mercury compound. 76 F. PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING ACIDS & ALKALIS Acids and alkalis are corrosive and reactive chemicals. They can cause corrosion of the materials with which they are in contact, including metal containers, structures, and equipment. They can also cause serious burns and eye damage to the people working with them. When in contact with certain metals or chemicals, they can react, releasing toxic fumes or flammable hydrogen gas. Acids and alkalis should be stored in cool, well ventilated areas, away from each other, metals, flammables, and oxidizing materials. Their storage areas should be regularly checked for spills and leaks, and suitable spill cleanup materials should be readi ly available. (Spill cleanup kits are available in the Office of Environmental Health & Safety in Chemistry B72 ). Protective clothing should be worn whenever acids or alkalis are handled. SUGGESTIONS FOR SAFE USE AND STORAGE 1. When combining an acid wit h water, pour the acid into the water - stirring slowl y, never the reverse. 2. Cap bottles securely and store them on lower shelves to reduce the chance of accidental breakage. Do not store acids and alkalis together. Do not store organics with acid s or alkalis. Do not store organic acids with inorganic acids. See Section V. 3. Do not leave residues on a bottle or a laboratory bench where another person may come in contact with them. Clean up spills promptly. 4. Wear protective clothing when handling acids or alkalis - this includes the appropriate gloves, apron, lab coat, chemical splash goggles and a face shield. 5. If you have been splashed with acids or alkalis, immediately remove any clothing that may have been saturated. If the splash is in your eye, flush the eye immediately and gently for at least 15 minutes with copious amounts of water. If the splash is on the body, flood the area with copious amounts of running water for at least 15 minutes - a safety shower or drench hose is intended for this purp ose. When alkaline materials have been splashed in the eye, immediate and repeated washings are necessary in order to prevent the alkali from penetrating deeply. Always s eek medical assistance. See Section I -E. 77 PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING ACIDS & ALKALIS (Cont'd.) FOUR ACIDS REQUIRING SPECIAL HANDLING BECAUSE OF THEIR EXTREME HAZARDS 1. Nitric Aci d: Nitric acid is corrosive and its oxides are highly toxic. Nitric acid is also an oxidizing agent that forms flammable and explosive compounds with many materials - for example, ethers and other flammable materials, acetone, and combustible materials. Do not mix them together . Paper towels used to wipe up a nitric acid spill can ignite spontaneously when dry. Nitric acid should be used only in a hood and should be stored away from combustible materials. Cons ult a SDS on Nitric Acid and its many hazards. 2. Perchloric aci d: Perchloric acid forms highly explosive and unstable compounds with many combustible materials and with metals. Unstable perchlorate compounds may collect in the duct work of improperly installed fume hoods and cause fire or violent explosions. Therefore, perchloric acid should be used with extr eme caution and only in a fume hood designed for its use - a perchloric acid hood has corrosion -resistant ductwork and washdown facilities. Only minimum quantities should be kept, with no more than a one pound bottle in the laboratory. The containe r should be stored on a glass tray that is deep enough to hold the contents of the bottle. No flammables or organic solvents should be used in a perchloric acid hood. Perchloric acid should not be kept for more than a year since explosive cryst als may form. Discolored perchloric acid should not be touched, it is most likely contaminated and could be dangerous. Contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safety for proper disposal. 3. Picric Aci d: Picric acid can form explosive compound s with many combustible materials. It is especially reactive with metals or metallic salts. Picric acid may lose water and become unstable during extended storage periods. Never open a bottle of dry or contaminated picric acid as an explosion could occur f rom the friction produced . If you find a container of picric acid that appears old and dry, DO NOT TOUCH IT . Immediately contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safety in Chemistry B72 . Picric acid should be stored away from combustible materials and should not be kept for extended periods. Do not use metal spatulas to dispense picric aci d. 4. Hydrofluoric Aci d: Hydrofluoric acid is extremely corrosive and will even attack glass. It is volatile and its vapors may affect the skin and eyes. Burns from hydrofluoric acid heal slowly and with great difficulty. The Office of Envir onmental Health and Safety will, upon request, provide calcium glutonate gel for immediate use on HF burns. Hydrofluroic acid should be used only in a fume hood while wearing protective clothing. Polyethylene containers must be used for storing hydrofl uoric acid and for reactions employing hydrofluoric aci d. Care should be taken to avoid contacting hydrofluoric acid with metals or ammonia since toxic fumes may result. See Appendix P for Hydrofluoric Acid Handling Guidelin es. CONSULT A SDS WHEN EVER WORKING WITH ANY OF THESE COMPOUNDS 78 G. PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING ALKALI METALS Alkali metals react violently with water, decomposing the water to give off hydrogen which may be ignited by the heat of reaction. The alkali metals can also ignite spontaneously in air, especially when the metal is in powdered form and/or the air is moist. SUGGESTIONS FOR S AFE USE AND STORAGE 1. Store alkali metals under mineral oil or kerosene in unbreakable containers or covered glass containers. Avoid using oils that contain sulfur since a hazardous reaction may occur. 2. Ordinary fire extinguishers are ineffective on an alkali metal fire. Use only the special, dry powder extinguisher intended for alkali metals - Class D - Combustible Metal. These extinguishers can be found in the corridors of the second and third floor of Chemistry. If you are using alkali m etals and need a fire extinguisher, contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safety. 3. Any waste alkali metals should be place d in a labeled, leak proof container, covered with mineral oil, and disposed of properly. See Section VII. 79 H. PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING NONTOXIC, NOXIOUS ODORS In the event your laboratory produces a nontoxic, noxious odor, make certain all fume hood fans in the laboratory are on, raise the fume hoods' sashes approximately one foot, and leave the laboratory, closing the door behind you. Do not open the laboratory's windows and doors to ventilate the laboratory as this allows the odor to travel to other floors and buildings. If the procedures outlined above are followed, the fume hoods will effectiv ely exhaust the odor out of the laboratory. Do not return to the laboratory until the odor has dissipated. In the event your laboratory produces a nontoxic, noxious odor while using the sink, as when washing out dirty glassware, follow the same procedures outlined above and be sure to leave the water running in the sink until the odor has dissipated. If you are aware that your work is going to create a nontoxic, noxious odor, contact the Office of Environmental Health and Safety and try to perform your ex periment after normal working hours. DO NOT DISPOSE OF NOXIOUS MATERIALS IN THE TRASH . CONTACT THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR PROPER DISPOSAL PROCEDURES . 80 VII. LABORATORY WASTE DISPOSAL /HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL 81 A. HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL PROGRAM UNIVERSITY AT ALBAN Y, STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed, under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), a complex set of regulations to control hazardous wastes. The University is currently holding a permit issued by the EPA as a hazardous waste generator. This permit allows the University, within strict EPA and DEC guidelines, t o manage all hazardous waste on campus. The Office of Environmen tal Health and Safety has instituted the following Hazardous Waste Disposal Program, in order to handle the hazardous waste generated on campus. This program is coordinated by the Unive rsity's Chemical Hygiene Officer/ Hazardous Waste Specialist . State law (Chapter 719 of the laws of 1981) established criminal penalties for the unlawful possession, handling, and disposing of hazardous wastes. Representation and indemnification under section 1 7 of the Public Officer's Law would not be available in cases of liability imposed under criminal statu tes. Because of the possibilities of personal liability and prison terms, campus personnel are advised to familiarize themselves with the University's Ha zardous Waste Disposal Program for the proper storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. The University at Albany encourages the use of green chemistry and whenever possible, waste minimization practices should be followed. ALL HAZARDOUS WASTE LEAVING THE UNIVERSITY FOR DISPOSAL IS REQUIRED TO BE INCINERATED, UNLESS SPECIAL PERMISSION IS RECEIVED FROM EH&S OR INCINERATION IS NOT POSSIBLE. The procedures stated below are to be followed by campus generators when identifying, storing and disposing of hazardou s waste: 1. IDENTIFICATION The responsibility for the identification of hazardous waste (waste chemicals, waste chemical containing products, and out -of-date chemicals) within the University necessarily rests with the faculty and staff who have created t he waste (generators) in research and instruction. See the following pages for the definitions of generator and hazardous wa ste. The Chemical Hygiene Officer / Hazardous Waste Specialist will provide assistance in the identification of hazardous waste. 2. LABELING AND STORAGE All containers of hazardous waste must be properly labeled with free labels provided by the Office of Environmental Health and Safety in Chem istry B72 . The waste chemicals must be identified by their proper chemical name ( not formulas ), including proportions of a mixture. The label must say \"HAZARDOUS WASTE \". The label must be completed before it will be accepted for disposal by the Office of Environmental Health and Safet y. The University is liable for the mislabeling of hazardous waste. Do not date the waste as the EH &S Office will date it, when it is put into the Hazardous Waste Room. Once a container is full, you must call the EH &S Office at 518 442-3495 as soon as possible . All waste must be kept in sealed containers at all times , unless you are actively po uring into the container. Zip-loc bags for dry debris must also be labeled and sealed . It is illegal to evaporate waste. Do not mix incompatible wastes. Ensure the wast e container is compatible with the waste and use the appropriately sized container, as our disposal costs are somewhat determined by the container size. 82 HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL PROGRAM (Cont'd.) 3. UNKNOWNS Unknown chemicals cannot be accepted for disposal by the Office of Environmental Health & Safet y. The EH &S Office has no way of disposing of unknowns. If the person wishing to dispose of the waste chemicals cannot trace down the identity of the waste, the Office of Environmental Health & Safety can have the University's Hazardous Waste Disposal Company identify them for a substantial cost to the generator. For this reason, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety strongly encourages Departments and Researchers, that have either departing faculty, staff or students, to have these departing persons identify any waste they may have generated before they leave. The Office of Environmental Health & Safety will assist in the identification of hazardous waste and arrang ing for its storage and ultimate disposal. The Office of Environmental Health & Safety is not responsible for cleaning abandoned laboratories of waste chemicals. See Appendix S. 4. STORAGE, PACKAGING AND COORDINATING DISPOSAL All chemical wastes must be packaged by the generator in a manner, which will allow them to be transported and stored without danger of spillage, escape of dangerous vapors, or hazardous reaction. Again, all wastes must be properly labeled. Once a container of hazardous waste is full or ready to be disposed of, the Hazardous Waste Specialist must be contacted as soon as possible at 518 442-3495. The Hazardous Waste Specialist will then pick up the waste container as soon as possible and will either put it into storage or pour if off in the Hazardous Waste Room. Another container of the same waste stream canno t be utilized, until the full waste container has been picked up. Do not accumulate any waste in your lab for longer than 2 months. This does not include full containers o f waste, which must be disposed of immediately. Routine disposal of hazardous waste through the EH &S Office is encouraged and it 's free! Do NOT stockpile old chemicals. If you haven't used it in 2 years, let the EH&S Office dispose of it for you. 5. TRANSPORTATION The Hazardous Waste Specialist in the Office of Environmental Health & Safety must be contacted at 518 442-3495 , in order to arrange for a pickup of hazardous waste. No waste is to be dropped off at the EH&S Office without prior permission from the Hazardous Waste Specialist or their designee. 6. COSTS The Office of Environmental Health and Safety pays for the disposal of routinely generated hazardous waste. The EH &S Office tries to reduce the cost of hazardous waste disposal i n many ways: by bulking waste chemicals when possible, disposing of full lab packs, using a bid process for contracting with a waste disposal company and by brokering usable chemicals within the University . Even with these combined efforts, the cost for t he disposal of waste chemicals far exceeds their original purchase price. It is thus recommended that the researcher order only the amount of a particular chemical that can be used within a year and/or by a particular research project. This will ultimate ly save the University money and it is definitely safer to store smaller amounts of chemicals. Chemical clean outs of labs or other areas are not considered routinely generated hazardous wastes. Please refer to the Laboratory Decommissioning Policy and C hecklist when performing a laboratory cleanout. See Appendix S. https://www.albany.edu/ehs/pdf/LabDecommissioningCheckList6 -2013.pdf 83 B. DEFINITIONS GENERATOR A generator is anyone who disposes of waste that is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be a \"hazardous waste\". You are a generator if, in your work/research at the University, you produce or find a hazardous chemical that you intend to discard. It is your responsibility to ensure that this waste is handled correctly as described in the above Hazardous Waste Disposal Program. Be aware that there are substantial civil and criminal penalties for any person, company, corporation, instituti on, association, etc. who improperly disposes of hazardous waste. HAZARDOUS WASTE A waste is defined by EPA to be hazardous, if it meets ANY of the following: 1. It is a \"solid waste or a combination of solid wastes ( a solid waste includes semi -solid, liquid, or contained gaseous material) which, because of its concentration, quantity, or physical, chemical, or infectious characteristics, may cause or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality, or an increase in serious irreversible or incapac itating illness, or may pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health, or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise managed.\" 2. It is included in lists of specifically identifiable compoun ds published by EPA. See Appendix F - EPA Hazardous Waste List. 3. It is a listed waste mixed with nonhazardous materials. 4. It has the characteristics of being ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or EP Toxicity, as defined by EPA. See below. 5. It is pers onally known to you to be hazardous based upon knowledge of the materials or processes used in producing the waste. 6. The four characteristics that determine if a waste is hazardous are as follows: a. Characteristic of Ignitability 1. It is a liquid, other than an aqueous solution containing less than 24% alcohol by volume, and has a flash point of less than 6 0\u00b0C (14 0\u00b0F). 2. It is not a liquid and is capable, under standard temperature and pressure, of causing fire through friction, absorption of moisture, or spontaneous chemical changes and when ignited burns so vigorously and persistently that it creates a hazard. 3. It is an ignitable compressed gas; any material or mixture having in the container an absolute pressure exceeding 40 p.s.i. at 7 0\u00b0F or any liquid flammable material having a vapor pressure exceeding 40 p.s.i. absolute at 10 0\u00b0F. 84 HAZARDOUS WASTE DEFINITIONS (Cont'd.) 4. It is an oxidizer; a substance such as a chlorate, permanganate, inorganic peroxide, or a nitrate, that yields ox ygen readily to stimulate the combustion of organic matter. b. Characteristic of Corrosivity 1. It is aqueous and has a pH less than or equal to 2, or greater than or equal to 12.5, as determined by a pH meter. 2. It is a liquid and corrodes steel (SAE 1 020) at a rate greater than 6.35 mm (0.250 inches) per year at a test temperature of 5 5\u00b0C (13 0\u00b0F) as determined by test methods specified by the National Association of Corrosion Engineers. c. Characteristic of Reactivity 1. It is normally unstable and r eadily undergoes vi olent change without detonating, 2. It reacts violently with water, 3. It forms potentiall y explosive mixtures with water, 4. When mixed with water, it generates toxic gases or vapors in a quantity sufficient to present a danger to human health or the environment, 5. It is a cyanide or sulfide -bearing waste which, when exposed to pH conditions between 2 and 12.5, can generate toxic gases or vapors in a quantity sufficient to present danger to human health or the environment, 6. It is capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating source or if heated under confinement, 7. It is readily capable of detonation or explosive decomposition or reaction at standard temperature and pressure, 8. It is a forbidden explosive, a Class A explosive or a Class B explosive as defined in 49 CFR 173.51 and 173.53 (see section 370.1(e) of this Title). d. Characteristic of EP (Extraction Procedure) Toxicity (1) A solid waste exhibits the characteristic of toxicity if, using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, Test Method 1311 in \"Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,\" EPA Publication SW -846, as incorporated by reference in subdivision 370.1(e) of this Title, the extract from a representative sample of the waste contains any of the contaminants listed in Table 1 at a c oncentration equal to or greater than the respective value given in that Table. Where the waste contains less than 0.5 percent filterable solids, the waste itself, after filtering using the methodology outlined in Method 1311, is considered to be the extra ct for the purpose of this subdivision. In NYS, a ll solid wastes containing 50 parts per million (ppm) by weight (on a dry weight basis for other than liquid wastes) or great er of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are listed hazardous wastes. There are a very few exce ptions to this; small capacitors and drained PCB articles , as defined in NYS DEC's regulations Part 371 . Please contact the EHS Office with any questions on PCB wastes. All non -empty aerosol cans are considered hazardous waste, a s are all compressed gas cylinders, whether they are empty or not. 85 Table 1. -- Maximum Concentration of Contaminants for the Toxicity Characteristic Contaminant Concentration for Toxicity EPA HW FOOTNOTE 1: Hazardous waste number. FOOTNOTE 2: Chemical abstracts service number. FOOTNOTE 3: Quantitation limit is greater than the calculated regulatory level. The quantitation limit therefore becomes the regulatory level. FOOTNOTE 4: If o -, m-, and p -Cresol concentrations cannot be differentiated, the total cresol (D026) concentration is used. The regulatory level of total cresol is 200 mg/l. 87 (2) A solid waste that exhibits the characteristic of toxicity has the EPA Hazardous Waste Number specified in Table 1 which corresponds to the toxic contaminant causing it to be hazardous. C. HAZARDOUS WASTE LABEL These labels are provided for free by the Office of Environmental He alth and Safety in Chemistry B72 . All Hazardous Waste should be l abeled with the words \"Hazardous Waste\" and the container's contents should be listed, no abbreviations or chemical formulas allowed. DO NOT DATE YOUR WASTE. EH &S dates it when it is put into the University's Hazardous Waste Room s. 88 D. EMPTY CHEMICAL CONTAINER AND GLASSWARE DISPOSAL POLICY In order to dispose of empty chemical containers (bottles, used glassware or cans), they must be: 1. Triple rinsed, with water or the appropriate solvent, depending on the chemical residues in the containe rs.* This is done in order to prevent a potential hazardous materials incident, when the containers are transported and crushed for disposal; 2. The containers' labels made illegible; 3. The tops taken off the clean containers and the containers taken to the C.A.S. Scientific Store in Chemistry B13 for disposal. Call C.A.S. Scientific Store at 518 442-4409 before you bring down your empty containers, so you can be sure someone is there to receive them. You must sign the log book i n the C.A.S. Scientific Store when you are dropping off empty chemical containers. Empty chemical containers MUST NOT be left in the lab's regular trash, the lab's broken glassware bin, the tunnel or in corridors. The C.A.S. Scientific Store's personnel will handle the disposal of all clean, empty chemical containers. Small pieces of clean glassware or broken glassware should be placed in a container specifically for glassware disposal. They should not be placed in the regular trash. Cardboard boxes, lined with plastic bags, specifically for glassware disposal, can be gotten for free from the C.A.S. Scientific Store . Once these boxes are full, they can be taken back down to the C.A.S. Scientific Store for disposal. The custodial staff is not responsib le for the disposal of empty chemical containers or broken glassware. A compressed gas cylinder is considered empty when the pressure in the cylinder approaches atmospheric. Compressed gas cylinders are still considered hazardous materials even when empt y. If you have empty lecture size gas cylinders or smaller to dispose of, contact the Office of Environmental Health and Safety. Disposal of larger size gas cylinders is handled throug h the C.A.S. Scientific Store in Chemistry B13. If you have any ques tions on the disposal of any type of waste or container, call the Office of Environmental Health and Safety at 518 442-3495. * The rinsate from Acute Hazardous Waste Containers (P Listed Wastes) is also considered a hazardous waste. The solvent you use to rinse a container may also be considered a hazardous waste. 89 E. REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE - Definition and Disposal A Guide to Managing Your Biological Waste at the University at Albany Section 1 - What you need to know: Definition: \"Regulated Medical Waste (RMW) shall mean any of the following waste which is generated in the diagnosis, treatment or immunization of human beings or animals, in research pertaining thereto, or in production and testing of biologicals, provide d however, that regulated medical waste shall not include hazardous waste identified or listed pursuant to Section 27 -0903 of the Environmental Conservation Law, or any household waste promulgated under this section\" 1 (e.g., biological waste generated at B iosafety Level 2, or material that has come into contact with is regarded as regulated medical waste). Laboratories operating at Biosafety Level 1 produce wastes that can be decontaminated chemically or by autoclaving, then disposed of in a black garbage bag, and into the regular trash, or in the case of liquid waste, down the drain. Refer to Section 2 - What You Need to Do Regulated medical waste cannot contain any hazardous chemical or radioactive waste components. If it does, the biological component m ust first be decontaminated and then the waste is treated as chemical or radioactive waste. RMW includes, but may not be limited to: Sharps - Discarded used or unused needles (even if not exposed to any infectious agents), hypodermic needles, complete syringes (needle & syringe body.) Pasteur pipettes t hat have come in contact with materials considered RMW All scalpel blades and razor blades. Broken glass, broken plastic Petri dishes, rigid plastic culture tubes, flasks, beakers and other lab ware in contact with infectious agents. Blood vials used in animal or human patient care, medical research, and clinical laboratories. Broken or unbroken glass slides and their covers that have been in contact with infec tious agents. Cultures and Stocks - Agents infectious to humans (those that require biosafety level 2 containment), including cultures and stocks from medical, pathological, or research laboratories, and their associated biologicals. Wastes from t he production of biologicals (defined as serums, vaccines, antigens, antitoxins, cell lines, and cultures), as well as materials used for cleanup of spills. Discarded live or attenuated vaccines, biological toxins. Systems used to grow and maintai n infectious agents in vitro, including, but not limited to nutrient agars, gels, and broths. Culture dishes and devices used to transfer, inoculate or mix cultures, including, but not limited to: plastic or glass plates, paper, gloves, growth m edia, gels, filters, stoppers, plugs, flasks, inoculation loops and wires, contaminated pipette tips, tubes, stirring devices, jars, etc. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Managing Regulated Medical Waste Guidelines for Implementation of Public Health Law 1389 AA GG and Environmental Regulations of 10 NYCRR, Part 70 Public Health Law 1389 aa: Definitions 90 Cell lines - human, primate, and any other animal (mammalian) cell lines, even in the absence of overt contamination, may contain latent viruses and/or other opportunistic pathogens or zoonotic agents (capable of transmitting disease from animals to man). Therefore, all mammalian cell lines must be disposed of as RMW in New Y ork State. Human Blood, Blood Products, and Human Pathological Wastes - Discarded waste blood and/or blood components (e.g., serum, plasma). Containers and/or materials containing free -flowing blood or blood components, and materials saturated wit h blood or blood products. Tissue, organs, body parts, body fluids removed during autopsy, or other medical procedures. Specimens of body fluids and their containers and discarded material saturated with such body fluids (other than urine). Hum an body fluids include: blood, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, amniotic fluid, and any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood. Feminine hygiene products used to absorb menstrual flow, along with bandages and gauze, for example, are not RMW. However, organs and tissues fixed for histological or cytological examinations must be processed as hazardous waste since the fixatives used are considered to be hazardous chemicals. Animal Wastes - carcasses, body parts, body fluids, blood, or bedding from animals known to be contaminated with infectious agents (e.g., zoonotic organisms) or from animals inoculated during research, production of biologicals, or pharmaceuti cal testing with infectious agents. Exposure to a known infectious agent is necessary before the waste is considered RMW. Section 2 - What you need to do: Containers - Containers for collection of regulated medical waste should be red in color, or if using framed containers the bag should be red in color. The containers shall have the biohazard symbol prominently visible to anyone approaching the container. All bags, containers, including sharps containers that are no longer in active use shall be sealed and have a tag affixed that indicates the contents, the generator identification (usually the name of the PI) and any special instructions (e.g. incinerate only). All containers and bags shall have a Biohazard symbol and the word Biohazard readily v isible. All RMW bags leaving the laboratory shall be double bagged and/or placed in a secondary container appropriately designed for the prevention of leaks during the transport of the materials to the Bio - Hazard Waste Room . RMW Sharps: Sharps must be c ollected in approved, rigid, leak proof, puncture -resistant containers that can be secured to prevent loss of contents. Each container must be red in color and prominently labeled with a universal biohazard sign or the word \"Biohazard\". Food containers, su ch as coffee cans or soda bottles, are not permissible as sharps containers. Appropriate containers are available through CAS Stores. Needles and syringe units should be discarded as a unit without clipping, bending, breaking, shearing, or recapping (shar ps boxes that clip off the needle are prohibited). Sharps containers should be discarded when they are three quarters (3/4) full. 91 Non-RMW Sharps: Non-RMW sharps should not be disposed of individually in the regular trash because they can puncture bags an d injure custodians or other personnel. Non -RMW sharps should be collected in approved, rigid, puncture resistant containers that are not red and not marked with the biohazard symbol. Prior to final disposal in the trash, these containers should be securel y taped closed and then disposed in the trash. If sharps contain residues of hazardous or radioactive materials, additional rules will apply (Contact EH &S for guidance at 518 442-3495) Cultures: Culture wastes (from BL2 labs) and other materials that may have come in contact with the culture, may be placed in red biohazard bags or, alternatively, if they are liquid cultures they can be autoclaved or chemically decontaminated, then disposed of as RMW. Culture wastes from (BL1 labs) may be autoclaved or chemically decontaminated, then placed in a black trash bag for disposal as regular lab trash. Liquid Waste: Liquid wastes from BL1 and BL2 labs that contain infectious or non -infectious agents (e.g., culture media, blood, body fluids), should be decontam inated. (Refer to the agent protocols to determine the proper disinfection method). For example, many biological liquid wastes can be treated with a 10 -fold dilution of household bleach (i.e., 9 parts liquid waste plus 1 part household bleach) for 10 -15 mi n before discharging down the laboratory sink drain. Contaminated Articles: Items such as cloth, gloves, plastic, and paper items that have been exposed to infectious agents that are hazardous to humans shall be placed in red biohazard bags. Other relate d waste streams: Regular (non -contaminated) trash destined for a sanitary landfill shall be placed in a black bag. Plastic Poly bags designed to be autoclaved, shall be placed in black garbage bags after autoclaving, prior to disposal, by lab personnel . Clear or black autoclave bags should be used for autoclaving in this instance. The bags should NOT be RED, have the word Biohazard or have a Biohazard symbol. Animal Waste: The guidance of the Director for Laboratory Animal Resources, shall be sought fo r handling and disposal of all animal waste and carcasses. Experiments using animals exposed to infectious agents, RG2, or requiring BL2 containment, shall be treated as RMW. Where the waste needs to go: Red bags: (BL 2 waste only) LSRB - call Dane Cellupica (1 -8866) or Jessica Moran (7-4414) to arrange disposal. Biology - call Michelle McConville at 2 -3495 to arrange disposal. Health Sciences Campus - Call Randy Williams at (1 -7210) to arrange disposal. Non-contaminated trash: (Clear or b lack bags only/ BL 1 waste) LSRB - Regular trash is picked up by the custodians, in the lab. Biology - Regular trash is picked up by the custodians, in the lab. 92 Autoclave Rooms: LSRB - BL 1 material can be left in the bins in the Autoclave rooms, post a utoclaving. BL 2 materials still need to go out as RMW. Refer to Red bags above. Biology - Each lab is responsible for correctly disposing of their own autoclaved waste, whether BL 1 or BL 2. Please refer above for the correct procedure. Sharps containers: LSRB - Return to CAS Stores, if purchased there, or call Dane Cellupica (1 -8866) Biology - Return to CAS Stores, if purchased there, or call Dane Cellupica (1 -8866) NOTE: DO NOT PLACE ANY TRASH or RED BAGS IN THE HALL. 93 VIII. APPENDICES 94 APPENDIX A. - REACTIVE CHEMICALS Reactive chemicals are substances, which under certain ambient or induced conditions, enter into violent reactions with spontaneous generation of large quantities of heat, light, gases (flammable and nonflammable), or toxicants that can be destructive to lives and property. The types of reactive chemicals have been loosely categorized: 1. Explosive - Many substances, when mixed, are potentially explosive (such as hydrazines and ni tric acid). In general, protect these substances from shock, elevated temperatures, rapid temperature changes, and other reactive chemicals. Some examples: nitroglycerin, nitrocellulose, organic Reducing Substa nces - In many oxidizing and reducing reactions, both agents must be present. However, in some cases, one or the other substance creates a hazard by coming into contact with a normally innocuous substance. The reactions tend to generate heat and ar e often explosive. Some oxidizing agents: agents: hydrogen, metallic hydrides, alkali metals, and pyrophoric agents such as activated zinc and phosphorus. 3. Water Sensitive Substances - These chemicals react with water, steam, and moisture in the air to evolve heat and/or flammable or explosive gases. Isolate water -sensitive substances from other reactive compounds. Store them in a cool, waterproof area. No water should service the storage area. Some substances that liberate heat only are: strong acids and bases, acid anhydrides and sulfides. Some substances that liberate flammable gases are: al kali metals, hydrides, nitrides, carbides, and anhydrous metallic salts. 4. Acid Sensitive Substances - These chemicals react with acid to evolve heat, flammable and/or explosive gases, and toxicants. Some examples are: alkali metals, and related elements, cyanides, sulfides, and structural alloys (most metals). 5. Special Organic Compounds - These compounds are unstable and may decompose spontaneously or through contact with the immediat e environment (air, water, and other 6. Pyroph oric Agents - Pyrophoric agents burn when exposed to air. In general, they require absolute protection against air. Examples: phosphorus and activated zinc. 95 REACTIVE CHEMICALS (Cont'd.) The following is a list of some specific HIGHLY REACTIVE C HEMICALS and their associated hazards (Note - this list is not all inclusive): HYDROFLUORIC ACID - This is a very insidious material. After any contact with a solution of hydrofluoric acid, even if there is no immediate pain, the area should be flushed with copious amounts of water for at least 5 minutes , then apply calcium glutonate gel (available from the Environmental Health and Safety Office in Chemistry B72 .) Consult a physician promptly. See Appendix P. PHENOL - When phenol is dissolved in organic solvents it is readily absorbed into the blood stream, resulting in serious or fatal poisoning. If phenol is accidentally spilled, flush area with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Consult a physician promptly. BROMINE - Bromine c an be measured volumetrically with little hazard. Keep a dilute sodium bisulfite solution on hand to destroy any accidentally spilled bromine. HYDROGEN CYANIDE - Hydrogen cyanide should always be used under a hood. Liquid hydrogen cyanide is best kept ove r anhydrous calcium chloride. It thus remains water -white for months. Formation of a yellow color in the liquid indicates the lot should be destroyed. PERCHLORATES - Perchlorates should be handled only by persons thoroughly familiar with the hazards invol ved. Do not use magnesium perchlorate as a desiccant, except in the standard procedure for the determination of carbon and hydrogen. DICHROMATE CLEANING SOLUTION - Dichromate cleaning solution is an extremely corrosive agent. Whenever possible, seek an al ternative, less hazardous cleaning solution. Never transfer the cleaning solution from a pipette washer by pouring. Use a siphon. Follow these precautions when using the cleaning solution: a. Keep the bottle caps loosened; b. Store th e solutions in a cool area, away from other chemicals; c. Keep protective equipment available in case of a spill (i.e., respirator, acid -resistant glov es, spill clean up kit, etc.); d. Dichromate cleaning solutions are considered hazardous waste . PHOSPHORUS TRIHALIDES - Containing moisture, may under certain circumstances, form some phosphine when heated, and explode violently when exposed to air. Red phosphorus and hydriodic acid may also form explosive compounds. These materials should be heat ed in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide. 96 REACTIVE CHEMICALS (Cont'd.) PHOSPHORUS OXYCHLORIDE - A serious accident occurred when this chemical was being distilled under vacuum. The vacuum changed and water ran back into the phosphorus oxychloride and the mixture exploded. This chemical should be distilled at normal pressure. If it is absolutely necessary to use a vacuum; adequate traps should be provided between the water pump and the received. (Other chemicals in the same category are: SO2Cl2, SOC l2, S2Cl2, PC l2, etc. Similar precautions should be employed in all vacuum distillations in which a water pump is used, because sudden loss of pressure will force water back up into the apparatus being evacuated. A Bunsen valve in the trap will avoid much of this difficulty. BENXOYL PEROXIDE - when dry, benzoyl peroxide is easily ignited and sensitive to shock. It will decompose spontaneously at temperatures above 5 0\u00b0C. It must be stored in a cool place. Keep away from all sources of heat. Do not subject it to friction or grinding in the dry state, since the heat generated will cause it to explode. This chemical is desensitized by the addition of at least 20% by weight of water (from DuPont Safety Manual). ALUMINUM CHLORIDE - Should be cons idered a potentially dangerous material. If moisture is present, sufficient decomposition to build up considerable pressure may result. If a bottle is to be opened after long standing, enclose it completely in a heavy towel and place the covered bottle in a metal container before opening the lid. Be sure to wear protective equipment. AMMONIA and MERCURY - In contact, these chemicals have been known to form explosive compounds (Ind. Eng. Chem., New Edition, 1932). HYDROXYL AMINE DERIVATIVES - Particularly t hose related to hydroxy aminic acid, should be treated as explosive compounds. Distillation of products in which they may be present should be conducted behind screens with all safety precautions taken. Acid salts of hydroxyl amine are explosive; hydroxyl may contain residual salts. CYANOGEN BROMIDE - Is explosive in the solid state unless it is absolutely white. Do not keep bottles of it tightly stoppered. PYRUVIC ACID - Has been reported to blow up while standing on the shelf. o-NITROBENZOYL CHLORIDE - Has exploded violently upon attempted distillation (Ind. Eng. Chem., New Ed., 23, 2394, (1945):JACS 68, 344, (1946)). NITRILES - Nitriles react similarly to hydrogen cyanide and should be handled under a hood. Any part of the bod y which has come in contact with any of these materials should be flushed with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Consult a physician promptly. Nitrile compounds in a vapor state are very toxic when inhaled and the same precautions used with hydrogen cyanide are necessary. ACRYLONITRILE (VINYL CYANIDE) - Is a very active poison. It is fatal immediately when breathed in a concentration of 270 ppm. (In. Hygiene and Toxicology, February, 1942, pg. 255). 97 REACTIVE CHEMICALS (Cont'd.) NITRIC O XIDE, NITROGEN DIOXIDE and ITS POLYMERS - Are produced when nitric acid reacts with organic materials. They are extremely dangerous because they give no warning. Never inhale them. If you do inhale them accidentally, get to fresh air, and consult a physici an immediately. DOWTHERM AND ALLIED HEAT -TRANSFER AIDS - While not active poisons, these have a cumulative effect which results in bodily changes after long exposure. They are readily absorbed by the skin and by clothing, particularly leather and wool. If exposed, wash the exposed parts and the clothing. Low concentrations of the vapor are detectable by odor when the exposure is infrequent, but continual exposure desensitizes the olfactory nerves so the odor is no longer apparent. Such exposure should be avoided. PHOSGENE - Phosgene is extremely dangerous because its symptoms are delayed for 4 to 8 hours, when small but toxic amounts are inhaled. If accidentally inhaled, consult a physician promptly. CYANURIC CHLORIDE - Cyanuric chloride is a lachrymator and may cause severe burns of the mucous membranes. Use only in a well -ventilated hood. When distilling it, use of the same precautions as for other acid chlorides. EPICHLOROHYDRIN - Undiluted epichlorohydrin is intensely irritating to the ski n. Because of the potential nephrotic effects, persons working with this materials on a continuing basis should undergo medical supervision. (Univ. Calif., the Toxicity of Epichlorohydrin, 1941, pamphlet, in Library). DIMETHYL SULFATE - Dimethyl sulfate i s an extremely reactive material, especially when it comes in contact with the skin or mucous membranes. A very short time of contact with the mucous membranes will result in painful burns. If it comes in contact with the eye, sight will be impaired if it is not removed immediately. Flush the eye and/or skin with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Consult a physician promptly. DIOXANE - Dioxane appears to be a poisonous compound with a delayed reaction. This material should be handled cautiously and not inhaled. Dioxane can readily form dangerous peroxides. See Appendix G. In addition to precautions to be taken during its distillation, condensation of its distilled vapors should be done with water above 1 2\u00b0C to prevent plugging the cond enser. BENZENE, TOLUENE, and CARBON TETRACHLORIDE - These chemicals are readily absorbed through intact skin, as well as through the respiratory tract. Do not handle them carelessly. Use only in a fume hood. Benzene and carbon tetrachloride are suspected or confirmed human carcinogens. Always consult a chemi cal's Safety Data Sheet before first using it . 98 APPENDIX B. GLOVE SELECTION The following links are for companies that may supply gloves to laboratories at the University at Albany. Available on each web site are chemical compatibility charts for the gloves supplied by each specific company. Please use them to verify that the gloves being used to handle a specific chemical are providing proper protection to the wearer. It is importan t to note that all chemicals may not be listed on the charts, and that two similar gloves supplied by two different companies may not provide the same level of protection. It is important, therefore, to use the compatibility chart for the manufacturer of the glove being used.

Hazardous Waste Minimization is the reduction, to the extent feasible, of hazardous waste that is generated or subsequently treated, stored, or disposed. Waste minimization includes any source reduction or recycling activity undertaken by a generator that results in: (1) the reduction of total volume or quantity of hazardous waste; (2) the reduction of toxicity of hazardous waste; or (3) both, as long as the reduction is consistent with the goal of minimizing present and future threats to human health and the environment. Over the last ten years, the University has undertaken several waste minimization activities. The Chemistry Department has significantly minimized the hazardous waste generated in their teaching labs by changing the types of experiments performed, by converting to less toxic chemicals and by perform ing microchemistry techniques. Facilities Management has been purchasing green cleaning products. The Office of Environmental Health and Safety ha s been proactive in recycling waste chemicals where feasible, and encouraging the practice of following the ACS 12 Design Principles of Green Chemistry. https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/principles/12 -principles -of-green -chemistry.html POLICY The EHS Office strongly encourages waste minimization efforts on campus and suggests the following: 1. ALWAYS ORDER THE SMALLEST QUANTITY NEEDED OF ANY CHEMICAL as it is safer to store and less expensive to dispose of smaller quantities. For the most part, it is more expensive to dispose of a chemical correctly than it is to purchase it. 2. Whenever possible , try to order the least toxic chemical required for y our research. The SDS can pr ovide you with this information. Follow ACS's 12 Design Principles of G reen Chemistry. 3. When you are finished with a chemical and you are not intending on using it for another two years or so, do not hang on to it. Try to broker it to a fellow researcher. Old chemicals can pose a serious safety hazard especially wh en peroxidizable or highly reactive. See the University's Chemical Hygiene Plan, Appendix G. 4. Label all Chemical containers with their contents , even if non -hazardous. Unknown chemicals are expensive to identify and could pose a potentially serious health and safety hazard. 5. When leaving University employment, please contact the Office of E nvironmental Health and Safety, so that we can facilitate appropriate chemical clean out of your labs. See Appendix S for the University's Lab Decommissioning Policy and Checklist. 121 APPENDIX I. - IDENTIFICATION, CONTROL AND PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING OF EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS Procedures for identification, control, handling and disposal of hazard ous chemicals is a major part of the University's Chemical Hygiene Plan. To reduce exposure to recognized risks and for compliance with the OSHA Standard \"Occupational Exposures to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories,\" this appendix for handling extremely hazardous chemicals should be added to your Chemical Hygiene Plan. DEFINITIONS OF EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS: A chemical or substance generally regarded by the scientific community as having properties that represent substantial risks to humans associ ated with the use, storage or disposal of the chemical. This can include select carcinogens, reproductive toxins, extremely flammable liquids, reactive materials and extremely toxic chemicals. The select carcinogens are those picked by various governmenta l agencies and are included on the lists attached to this appendix. Reproductive toxins are chemicals which affect the reproductive capabilities including chromosomal damage (mutations), and/or have effects on fetuses (teratogenesis). Extremely flammable l iquids have an NFPA rating of 4. Reactive chemicals have an NFPA rating of 3 or 4. Extremely toxic chemicals have an NFPA health rating of 4 and/or usually have a LD 50 in rodents of less than 25 mg/kg, when administered orally, although other factors can be included. NFPA ratings can be fo und on the substance's Safety Data Sheet ( SDS). PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS: 1. The precautions and procedures described in the University's Chemical Hygiene Plan for the safe handling of chemicals must be adhered to , in addition to the following specific laboratory procedures. 2. Before beginning a laboratory operation /experiment , one is required to read and understand information found on the Safety Data Sheet for every hazardous chemical used during the laboratory operation. All laboratory experimental procedures (specific standard operating procedures, including all safety measures to be followed ) should be put in writing and then a risk assessment must be performed with or by the P.I., before the experiment can proceed. A risk assessment asks the question here is what I want to do, what can go wrong and how can I mitigate it. 3. If extremely hazardous chemicals are used, then it is desirable that there be two persons present in the laboratory at all times. The P.I. for the lab should also be notified. 4. Protect hands and forearms by wearing a lab coat and suitable long gloves. Always wear chemica l splash goggles. AVOID any contact with hazardous chemicals. 5. All procedures involving hazardous chemicals must be performed in a fume hood or biological cabinet (or other suitable containment device.) 6. After handling or working with hazardo us materials, wash hands and arms immediately. NEVER eat, drink, smoke, chew gum, apply cosmetics, take medicine, or store food in areas where hazardous chemicals are being used or stored. 122 Appendix I. con't. 7. All hazardous chemicals should be la beled with appropriate warnings (Cancer -Suspect Agent, Reactive, etc.) Label all research vessels. 8. Approved DESIGNATED AREA signs must be posted in all designated areas. A designated area \"means an area which may be used for work with select carcinogens' (see attached lists), reproductive toxins or substances which have a high degree of acute toxicity. A designated area may be the entire laboratory, area of a laboratory or a device such as a laboratory fume hood.\" The DESIGNATED AREA signs attached to this appendix (on the next page) must be filled out with the approp riate information and posted by that area. If the chemicals used in that area change, the sign must also be changed. Alternatively, the lab door sign may be complet ed and posted. Use the link below. https://www.albany.edu/ehs/pdf/LaboratoryEntranceSign2017.pdf 9. Written emergency procedur es can be found in the SDS for hazardous chemical s used in a lab. For assistance in obt aining SDSs, contact the EHS Office or visit the EHS Web page - Quick Links at http://www.albany.edu/ehs/ Persons working in the lab must b e familiar with these procedures be fore working with the chemical , in case of a chemical spill or accident . Refer to the University's Chemical Hygiene Plan for Chemical Spill Procedures. 10. The Office of Environ mental Health and Safety should be consulted with on laboratory procedures or experiments using extremely ha zardous chemicals, after the P.I. has developed and reviewed the written standard operating procedures. The EH &S Office may require additional procedures or require ments. Coor dination with the EH &S Office is essential prior to commencement of experiments utilizing extremely hazardous chemicals , radioactive materials, radiation producing equipment or infectious agents or toxins . 11. Laboratory vacuum pu mps used with hazardous chemicals should be vented into a fume hood. Biosafety Cabinets using a vacuum pump should have an in -line HEPA filter attached to the vacuum system, in order to protect it from aerosolized microorganisms. 12. Hazardous and extremely hazardous chemical waste must be turned into the Office of Environmental Health and Safety for proper disposal. Refer to the University's Chemical Hygiene Plan for proper waste disposal procedures. 123 DESIGNATED AREA FOR EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS/SELECT CARCINOGENS/POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS REP ____ PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:____________________ 124 APPENDIX J. - FORMALDEHYDE POLICY FACILITIES MANAGEMENT - OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SAFETY The Policy on the Use of Formaldehyde 4/17/18 - Last Revision INTENT This policy reviews the OSHA standard 1910.1048 for Formaldehyde.

Do not ever use liquid air or liquid oxygen in these dewars because either of which could present a combustion hazard with some materials used in the construction of these dewars, or materials stored in them. Introduction The safe handling and use of liquid nitrogen in liquid nitrogen dewars or flasks is possible only by knowing the potential hazards and using common -sense procedures based on that knowledge. There are two important properties of liquid nitrogen that present potential hazards: 1. It is extremely cold. At atmospheric pressure, liquid nitrogen boils at -320\u00b0F / -196\u00b0 C. 2. Very small amounts of liquid vaporize into large amounts of gas. One liter of liquid nitrogen becomes 24.6 ft3/0.7 m3 of gas. The safety precautions as outlined must be followed to avoid potential injury or damage which could result from these two charact eristics. Do not attempt to handle liquid nitrogen until you read and fully understand the potential hazards, their consequences, and the related safety precautions. Maintenance: Keep the unit clean and dry at all times. Do not use strong alkaline or aci d cleaners that could damage the finish and corrode the metal shell. Handling Liquid Nitrogen Contact of liquid nitrogen or any very cold gas with the skin or eyes may cause serious freezing (frostbite) injury. Protect hands at all times when working with liquid nitrogen with Cryo Gloves. Handle liquid nitrogen carefully The extremely low temperature can freeze human flesh very rapidly. When spilled on a surface the liquid tends to cover it completely and intimately, cooling a large area. The gas issuing from the liquid is also extremely cold. Delicate tissue, such as that of the eyes, can be damaged by an exposure to the cold gas which would be too brief to affect the skin of the hands or face. Never allow any unprotected part of your body to touch obje cts cooled by liquid nitrogen. Such objects may stick fast to the skin and tear the flesh when you attempt to free yourself. Use tongs, preferably with insulated handles, to withdraw objects immersed in the liquid, and handle the object carefully. Wear p rotective clothing Protect your eyes with a face shield or safety goggles (safety glasses without side shields do not give adequate protection). Always wear cryo gloves when handling anything that is, or may have been, in PLEASE contact EHS before ordering any of the chemicals on DHS's COI LIST. For Full List go to Appendix X. 132 APPENDIX M - SAFE HANDLING OF LIQUID NITROGEN Only trained individuals should be handling liquid nitrogen. * Use only liquid nitrogen in liquid nitrogen dewars.

Always wear cryo gloves when handli ng anything that is, or may have been, in immediate contact with liquid nitrogen. The gloves should fit loosely, so that they can be thrown off quickly if liquid should splash into them. When handling liquid in open containers, it is advisable to wear high-top shoes. Trousers (which should be cuffless if possible) should be worn outside the shoes. Any kind of canvas shoes should be avoided because a liquid nitrogen spill can be taken up by the canvas resulting in a far more severe burn, in fact that would occur if the feet were essentially open or bare! Now we don't advocate going bare foot when using liquid nitrogen, but we also don't think that the wearing of canvas shoes is a safe practice either. 133 APPENDIX M - Safe Handling of Liquid Nitrogen (Cont'd .) Use only containers designed for low -temperature liquids Cryogenic containers are specifically designed and made of materials that can withstand the rapid changes and extreme temperature differences encountered in working with liquid nitrogen. Even th ese special containers should be filled slowly to minimize the internal stresses that occur when any material is cooled. Excessive internal stresses can damage the container. Do not ever cover or plug the entrance opening of any liquid nitrogen dewar. Do not use any stopper or other device that would interfere with venting of gas. These cryogenic liquid containers are generally designed to operate with little or no internal pressure. Inadequate venting can result in excessive gas pressure which could dama ge or burst the container. Use only the loose -fitting necktube core supplied or one of the approved accessories for closing the necktube. Check the unit periodically to be sure that venting is not restricted by accumulated ice or frost. Use proper transfe r equipment Use a phase separator or special filling funnel to prevent splashing and spilling when transferring liquid nitrogen into or from a dewar. The top of the funnel should be partly covered to reduce splashing. Use only small, easily handled dewars for pouring liquid. For the larger, heavier containers, use a cryogenic liquid withdrawal device to transfer liquid from one container to another. Be sure to follow instructions supplied with the withdrawal device. When liquid cylinders or other large sto rage containers are used for filling, follow the instructions supplied with those units and their accessories. Do not overfill containers Filling above the bottom of the necktube (or specified maximum level) can result in overflow and spillage of liquid when the necktube core or cover is placed in the opening. Never use hollow rods or tubes as dipsticks When a warm tube is inserted into liquid nitrogen, liquid will spout from the bottom of the tube due to gasification and rapid expansion of liquid inside the tube. Wooden or solid metal dipsticks are recommended; avoid using plastics that may become very b rittle at cryogenic temperatures which then become prone to shatter like a fragile piece of glass. Nitrogen gas can cause suffocation without warning. Store and use liquid nitrogen only in a well - ventilated place. As the liquid evaporates, the resulting gas tends to displace the normal air from the area. In closed areas, excessive amounts of nitrogen gas reduce the concentration of oxygen and can result in asphyxiation. Because nitrogen gas is colorless, odorless and tasteless, it cannot be detected by t he human senses and will be breathed as if it were air. Breathing an atmosphere that contains less than 19 percent oxygen can cause dizziness and quickly result in unconsciousness and death. Note: The cloudy vapor that appears when liquid nitrogen is exp osed to the air is condensed moisture, not the gas itself. The gas actually causing the condensation and freezing is completely invisible. Never dispose of liquid nitrogen in confined areas or places where others may enter. First Aid Notice If a person seems to become dizzy or loses consciousness while working with liquid nitrogen, move to a well-ventilated area immediately. If breathing has stopped, apply artificial respiration. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. Call a physician. Keep warm and at rest. If exposed to liquid or cold gas, restore tissue to normal body temperature 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C) as rapidly as possible, followed by protection of the injured tissue from further damage and infection. Remove or loosen clothing that may constric t blood circulation to the frozen area. Call a physician. Rapid warming of 134 APPENDIX M - Safe Handling of Liquid Nitrogen (Cont'd.) the affected part is best achieved by using water at 108\u00b0F/42\u00b0C). Under no circumstances should the water be over 112\u00b0F/44 \u00b0C, nor should the frozen part be rubbed either before or after rewarming. The patient should neither smoke, nor drink alcohol. Most liquid nitrogen burns are really bad cases of frostbite. We don't mean to belittle the harm that can come from frostbite, but at the same time, we wanted to keep the dangers associated with liquid nitrogen burns in perspective. Indeed, liquid nitrogen burns could be treated as frostbite. Handling Liquid Nitrogen Dewars Keep unit upright at all times except when pouring liqu id from dewars specifically designed for that purpose. Tipping the container or laying it on its side can cause spillage of liquid nitrogen. It may also damage the container and any materials stored in it. If tipping is anticipated, be sure to purchase a dewar that can be outfitted with a tipping stand. Rough handling can cause serious damage to dewars. Dropping the container, allowing it to fall over on its side, or subjecting it to sharp impact or severe vibration can result in partial or complete loss of vacuum. To protect the vacuum insulation system, handle containers carefully. Do not \"walk\", roll or drag these units across a floor. Use a dolly or handcart when moving containers, especially the larger dewars. Large units are heavy enough to cause pe rsonal injury or damage to equipment if proper lifting and handling techniques are not used. When transporting a liquid nitrogen dewar, maintain adequate ventilation and protect the unit from damage. Do not place these units in closed vehicles where the nitrogen gas that is continuously vented from unit can accumulate. Prevent spillage of liquids and damage to unit by securing it in the upright position so that it cannot be tipped over. Protect the unit from sever jolting and impact that could cause damag e, especially to the vacuum seal. Keep the unit clean and dry Do not store it in wet, dirty areas. Moisture, animal waste, chemicals, strong cleaning agents and other substances which could promote corrosion should be removed promptly. Use water or mild detergent for cleaning and dry the surface thoroughly. Do not use strong alkaline or acid cleaners that could damage the finish and corrode the metal shell. Protect Dewar Contents Materials stored in a liquid nitrogen dewar with a wide mouth are protecte d by the extremely low temperature of the liquid nitrogen or the gas that issues from the evaporating liquid nitrogen. When all of the liquid nitrogen has evaporated, the temperature inside the unit will rise slowly to ambient. The rate at which the liquid nitrogen will evaporate depends upon the pattern of container use and the age and condition of the container. Evaporation increases as insulation efficiency deteriorates with age and rough handling. Opening and closing to insert and remove materials and m oving the unit will also increase the evaporation rate. *Contact EH&S for additional information on available training for liquid nitrogen users or go to MyUAlbany, sign in, then go to Blackboard, then click on Community, then search EHS under Organizati on Search, then click on EHS -Liquid -Nitrogen -Handling, then enroll. 135 APPENDIX N - Universal Waste Disposal Policy and Guidelines plus Electronics Recycling FACILITIES MANAGEMENT - OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SAFETY Universal Waste Disposal Policy and Guidelines plus Electronics Recycling Last Revision: 4/17/18 INTENT To adhere to 6 NYCRR Subpart 374 -3 from the NYS Department of Environmental Conservations that sets the Standards for Universal Wastes. The University at Albany incorporates these standards into their Universal Waste Disposal Policy and Guidelines. Subpart 374 -3 establishes requirements for managing Batteries, Pesticides, Thermostats and Lamps as Universal Waste as described in subdivision 374 -3.1. POLICY BATTERIES: All used or unwanted batteries generated at the University at Albany must be disposed as either universal waste or hazardous waste. Spent lead -acid batteries not handled as hazardous waste, must go out as universal waste. Vendors supplying lead -acid batteries to the University at Albany shall be required to remove and dispose of these batteries when discarded by the University at Albany as universal waste in accordance with Subpart 37 4-3 and state contract requirements. Anyone disposing of lead -acid batteries through the state contracts must keep on file all signed shipping papers for at least three years. All other types of batteries, such as alkaline, nickel cadmium, nickel iron, n ickel metal hydride, carbon zinc, zinc air, mercuric oxide, button cells, silver oxide, zinc carbon (mercury -containing), mercury, alkaline (mercury -containing), lithium metal, ion and magnesium, lead -acid and sealed lead -acid (non - automotive), are all co nsidered to be universal wastes when discarded and to be handled in accordance with Subpart 374 -3. Batteries should be sorted by type for disposal. The Office of Environmental Health and Safety is responsible for coordinating the disposal of universal wa ste at the University at Albany. Contact the Office of Environmental Health and Safety at 518 442 -3495 in Chemistry B72 , if you have any questions about battery disposal, if you need waste battery containers or if you have batteries that need to be discarded.

Appendix P - Procedures for Handling Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) HEALTH HAZARDS Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is an extremely corrosive acid used for many purposes including mineral digestion, surface cleaning, etching, and biological staining. HF's unique properties make it significantly more hazardous than many of the other acids used on campus. This appendix discusses how to protect yourself against the dangers of HF. Attached you'll also find emergency procedures for dealing with HF exposures. Please post these procedures wherever HF is used or handl ed. The health hazards of HF are dependent upon the type of exposure and the concentration. Eye and skin exposure HF is corrosive and readily destroys tissue. Exposure of the eyes to HF may result in blindness or permanent eye damage. HF readily penetrates human skin , allowing it to destroy soft tissues and decalcify bone. Chemical burns from HF are typically very painful and slow to heal. Skin exposure to high concentrated HF (approximately 50% or greater) immediately results in serious and painful destruc tion of tissue. Not only can skin contact cause burns, but systemic fluoride poisoning may also result. One of HF's most insidious properties is that skin contact at lower concentrations may not produce pain or burning sensations until hours after the expo sure. Because of the ability of HF to produce severe delayed tissue damage without necessarily producing pain, all skin, eye, or tissue contact with HF should receive immediate first aid and medical evaluation, even if the injury appears minor or no pain i s felt. Inhalation of HF vapor Inhaling HF vapors can seriously damage the lungs. Delayed reactions up to and including fatal pulmonary edema (flooding of the lungs with body fluids) may not be apparent for hours after the initial exposure. OSHA limits emp loyees' exposure to airborne concentrations of HF to an average of 3 parts per million (ppm) over an 8 -hour work day. Airborne concentrations of 10 to 15 ppm will irritate the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. Thirty ppm is considered immediately dangerou s to life and health and may have irreversible health effects. At airborne concentrations above 50 ppm, even brief exposure may be fatal. Chronic HF exposure Long -term or chronic exposure to HF may result in fluorosis, a syndrome characterized by weight lo ss, bone embrittlement, anemia, and general ill health. 140 INFORMATION AND TRAINING Employee Information and Training HF is a colorless liquid with a strong irritating odor at low concentrations (3 ppm). Employees who handle HF must receive documented training on the hazards of HF and what to do in the event of an exposure or a spill by their supervisor o r Principal In vestigator . A Safety Data Sheet (SDS) on HF should always be kept in the immediate wor k area where HF is used. The SDS, togeth er with this appendix , is an excellent basis for training employees on the hazar ds of HF. EHS is available for providing assistance with training upon request . ENGINEERING CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION Ventilation HF should be used with adequate venti lation to minimize inhalation of vapor. Concentrations greater than 5% should always be handled inside a properly functioning chemical fume hood. The chemical fume hood needs to have a current calibration sticker (wi thin 1 year). Call the EH&S Office at 51 8 442 -3495, if the hood you a re using has not been inspected within 1 year. Eye Protection Always use chemical splash goggles together with a face shield when handling concentrated HF. Due to HF's highly corrosive nature, safety glasses with side shields d o not provide adequate eye protection. Body Protection Wear a laboratory coat with a chemical splash apron made out of natural rubber, neoprene, or viton. Never wear shorts or open -toed shoes when handling HF or other corrosive chemicals. Gloves Typically, medium or heavyweight viton, nitrile, or natural rubber gloves are worn when working with HF. Always consult the manufacturer's glove selection guide when selecting a glove for HF. If you have any questions about which glove to choose, contact EHS at 442-3495. A second pair of nitrile exam gloves should be worn under the gloves for protection against leaks. Gloves that have not been contaminated with HF may be disposed of in the common trash. If gloves become contaminated with HF, remove them immediately, thoroughly wash your hands, and check your hands for any sign of contamination. Contaminated gloves must be disposed of as HF waste . Mild HF burn to thigh from commercial rust stain remover. FIRST AID AND EMERGENCY PROCEDURES (also refer to MSDS /SDS ) Eyewash and Shower Since HF is corrosive and rapidly damages tissue, an eyewash and shower must be nearby and accessible. Eye exposure: Immediately irrigate eyes at eyewash for at least 15 minutes with copious quantities of water keeping 141 eyelids apart and away from eyeballs. Do not apply calcium gluconate gel to eyes. In all cases of eye exposure , seek prompt medical attention. Skin Exposu re: Immediately wash affected area of skin at sink if a small area of hand or forearm has been contaminated or at a drench shower if upper arms, torso, or legs are contaminated. If calcium gluconate gel is readily available, limit rinsing to 5 minutes so t hat application can be quickly initiated to limit the migration of the fluoride ion. Reapply and massage calcium gluconate gel into affected area of skin every 15 minutes. If calcium gluconate gel is not available rinse skin for a minimum of 15 minutes. R emove all contaminated clothing and place in hood or plastic bag. In all cases of skin exposure , seek prompt medical attention. Ingestion: Drink large amounts of water to dilute. Do not induce vomiting. Several glasses of milk or several ounces of milk of magnesia may be given for their soothing ef fect. In all cases of ingestion, seek prompt medical attention. Inhalation: Move victim to fresh air. In all cases of overexposure through inhalation , seek prompt medical attention. Calcium Gluconate Gel Calcium g luconate gel is a topical antidote for HF skin exposure. Calcium gluconate works by combining with HF to form insoluble calcium fluoride, thus preventing the extraction of calcium from tissues and bones. Keep calcium gluconate gel nearby whenever you're wo rking with HF. Calcium gluconate can be ordered through Life Safety Associates www.lifesafety.com or Fisher Scientific, plus other vendors. Calcium gluconate has a limited shelf life and should be stored in a refri gerator , if possible and replaced with a fresh supply after its expiration date has passed. Use disposable nitrile gloves to apply calcium gluconate gel . Even after applying calcium gluconate, it is essential that a medical evaluation be made. The EH&S Of fice also keeps calcium gluconate in stock. Note: Exposure to HF requires immediate and specialized first aid and medical treatment. Delays in first aid care o r medical treatment will likely result in greater damage or may, in some cases, result in a fatal outcome. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR HANDLING AND STORAGE OF HF Safe Work Practices If possible, avoid working alone when you're using HF. Do not eat, smoke, or drink where HF is handled, since the chemical can be swallowed. Wash hands thoroughly after handling HF. HF Spills If HF is spilled outside a chemical hood, evacuate the area, close the doors, post the area with a sign to prevent others from entering, and call for assistance . Refer to section in plan on chemical spill procedures . Small spills of HF inside a chemical fume hood can be cleaned up by laboratory staff , if they have received spill clean up training , have the correct equipment, understand the hazards, and are confident in their ability to clean up the spill safely and dispose of the waste properly as hazardous waste . Lime soda, ash, sodium bicarbonate, or a spill absorbent specified for HF should be used for clean up. Contact EHS for free HF spill kits. Organic spill kits that contain Floor -Dri, kitty litter, or sand should not be used because HF reacts with silica to produce silicon tetrafluoride, a toxic gas. Storage Store all HF and HF waste in labeled chemically compatible containers (e.g., polyethylene or Teflon). Glass, metal, and ceramic containers are not compatible with HF. HF should never be stored with 142 incompatible chemicals such as ammonia or other alkaline materials. Always place HF on a low protected shelf or other location where it will not be accidentally spilled or knocked over. Waste HF waste should be placed in a chemically compatible container with a sealed lid and clearly labele d. Complete a Hazardous Waste Label and call EHS at 518 44 2-3495 for a waste pickup or if you have any questions regarding the disposal of HF waste. Hazards Associated with Other Fluori ne Compounds Many chemicals containing fluorine, such as ammonium fluoride, sodium fluoride, sulfur tetrafluoride, and ammonium bifluoride, may react with acid or wate r to produce HF. Review the SDS of all fluoride compounds carefully for safety precaution s to reduce the risk of creating a HF hazard. If the manner in which the fluorine compound is used can create HF, follow the precautions for HF and keep topical antidote on hand. Questions?

Before an asset can be surplused or relocated, it must be evaluated by the end user or department representative to determine, if the asset contains or is contaminated with any hazardous materials, hazardous waste and/or universal waste that needs be removed before the asset can be surplused or relocated. This evaluation of the asset sh ould include both a visual inspection and a review of any manufacturer's operator guides or specs. The attached checklist must be used to assist with this evaluation for each asset and must be signed and dated by the person responsible for the asset. The checklist must then b e given to EH&S in Chemistry B72 . 2. The Office of Environmental Health and Safety must be contacted at 518 -442-3495, before the asset can be surplused or relocated , if the asset is suspected of being contaminated with or of containing any hazardous materials, hazardous waste and/or universal waste. A copy of the completed checklist must be given to EH&S to assist in evaluating the asset for removal. EH&S will provide guidance and assistance in identifying and, if necessary, removing any materials that may have to be removed from the asset before it can be surplused or relocated. EH&S will also pay for the disposal of any hazardous material, hazardous waste and/or universal waste removed from the asset. 3. Once the asset has b een evaluated by EH&S and any necessary hazardous materials, hazardous waste and/or universal waste have been removed from the asset, EH&S will clear the asset for surplusing or relocation. This clearance from EH&S will be in the form of a green tag attac hed to the asset with an EH&S staff member's signature and date on it. Once the asset has been cleared and tagged by EH&S, you may submit the appropriate OEM form(s) to OEM for the surplusing or relocation of the asset. Should you have any questions or c oncerns regarding the surplusing or relocation of an asset, please contact OEM at 518 -437-4596.

These materials must be protected from unauthorized access, misuse, or removal/theft. The intent of this policy is to safe guard the University at Albany laboratories and to keep the Uni versity Community safe. POLICY In laboratories, this security obligation rests primarily with the Principal Investigator or Faculty member in charge of the laboratory; however, all laboratory personnel have a responsibility to take reasonable precautions against theft or misuse of materials, particularly those that could threaten the public. Research or other activities involving the use of laboratory space, materials or equipment without the knowledge and approval of the responsible Principal Investiga tor is strictly prohibited. Violation of this prohibition may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. At a minimum , the University expects all laboratory personnel to comply with the following security and safety procedures: 1. Ques tion the presence of unfamiliar individuals in the laboratories and corridors and report all suspicious activity immediately to the University Police Department at 518 442-3131. 2. LOCK all laboratory and storage room doors when no one is present, even for a few minutes. Do NOT use magnetic stirrers to keep laboratory doors unlocked. 3. Do NOT leave hazardous materials or hazardous reactions unattended or unsecured at any time. 4. Lock fr eezers, refrigerators, storage cabinets, drawers, and other equipment where hazardous chemicals, poisons, carcinogens, chemicals of interest (COIs), radioactive materials, biological agents, controlled substances, and needles and syringes are stored when t hey are not in use. Be particularly aware of storing materials in equipment that is located outside a locked area. 5. Dispose of unneeded hazardous materials as soon as possible through the Office of Environmental Health and Safety at 518 442 -3495. 154 6. All lab oratories must have a current, readily accessible inventory of all hazardous materials located in their lab , along with readily accessible Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) . Take additional periodic inventory of all highly hazardous chemicals, poisons, carcinogens , chemicals of interest (COIs), biological agents/toxins, radioactive materials, controlled substances, and needles and syringes. 7. Report missing hazardous materials (including everything listed above), equipment, or glassware to the P.I. and the University Police Departmen t at 518 442 -3131 immediately. Also, inform the Department Chair and Environmental Health and Safety. Laboratory building exterior doors are secured after normal business hours. To minimize the likelihood of unauthorized access , all after -hours building users should: 1. Avoid providing building access to unfamiliar individuals. 2. Secure doors behind them. 3. Immediately report any building security problem to the University Police Department at 518 442 -3131. 155 APPENDIX W - HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ORDERING PROCEDURE FACILITIES MANAGEMENT - OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SAFETY Hazardous Materials Ordering Procedures Implemented 11/2011 - Last Revision 2/2019 A Hazardous Materials Ordering Procedure is being implemented, in order to better comply with U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security and other control agency requirements. Effective November 17th, 2011, all chemical and hazardous material orders will be reviewed by EHS before being processed by the Office of Pu rchasing and Contracts (Purchasing). The current department ordering process will remain the same. Purchasing will electronically forward all orders for chemicals and hazardous materials to EHS for review and approval before placing the order with the ve ndor. The current purchase requisition form has a new Hazardous Materials and DHS Chemical of Interest (COI) check box for your use when filling out the form. EHS is also requesting that when possible, the Chemical Abstracts Service number (CAS #) be inc luded on the purchase requisition when placing any hazardous materials order. EHS intends to approve all orders the same day, but are asking for a 24 hour turnaround time Monday through Friday. This procedure will require that you plan your chemical and hazardous material orders to allow sufficient time for this review process. EHS will try to accommodate time sensitive mission critical orders in an expedited fashion. In the event of an emergency on campus, this new preapproval procedure will enable EHS to give emergency responders a better chemical inventory for any given area. All areas on campus using hazardous materials are still required to maintain an updated chemical inventory, along with the hazardous materials' SDSs. Also, this procedure will allow EHS to more easily comply with various regulations. EHS does not foresee denying any chemical purchases but in the event they have a question on an order, you will be notified as soon as possible. Purchasing and EHS have already successfully pilote d this process. If your material is on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Chemicals of Interest list (DHS COIs), please place a mark in the checkbox of the purchase requisition . If it is determined by EHS that the COI can be ordered, there may be a delay while the information is verified and protocols updated. Attached is a shortened list of these chemicals of interest. The full list can be found through the link below to DHS. All COIs should be denoted on a lab's chemical inventory, along with the quantity of the COI. http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/chemsec_appendixa -chemicalofinterestlist.pdf Please note that it is against NYS/University Procurement Card Policy and Guidelines to purchase chemicals/hazardous materials with the card. If you use your procurement card to purchase hazardous materials, you may lose the privilege of having a procurement card. https://www.albany.edu/accounting/procurement -card.php For questions in regard to this proce dure, please contact the Environmental Health and Safety Office at 518 442 -3495. *Hazardous chemicals are defined by the OSHA Lab standard, as a chemical for which there is statistically significant evidence, based on at least one study conducted in accord ance with established scientific principles, that acute or chronic health effects may occur in exposed employees. 156 This includes chemicals which are carcinogens, toxic or highly toxic agents, reproductive toxins, irritants, corrosives, hepatot oxins, neurotoxins, agents which act on the hematopoietic systems, and agents which damage the lungs, skin, eyes or mucous membranes. ** HHS and USDA Select Agents and Toxins Li st -No select agents or toxins are to be purchased, used or transferred onto the University at Albany . For the list of Select Agents and Toxins go to https://www.selectagents.gov/SelectAgentsandToxinsList.html *** DEA List of Controlled Substances - Researchers need a NYS DOH License and a DEA Registration Number to order these substances. For a list of Controlled Substances go to https://www.deadi version.usdoj.gov/schedules/index.html 157 APPENDIX X. Chemicals of Investigator: Department: Building: Room: Date Complete: I have no Chemicals in this room : I have Chemicals in this room, But none on this list: Signature: In order to ensure that the University at Albany remains compliant with the Department of Homeland Security's Chemical Facility Anti -Terrorism Standard (CFATS), the University must maintain an accurate inventory of all chemicals that are included on the De partment's Chemicals of Interest (COI) list . All divisions, departments, laboratories and trade shops that possess any chemicals must complete this inventory annually for every sp ace or room under their supervision. Any chemical that is included on the COI inventory that is in your possession should be recorded with its approximate weight in pounds (1 lb. = 455 grams or ml). Common COI chemicals found at the University are highligh ted below. Each time a COI is purchased, the inventory shall be updated and submitted to EH&S in Chemistry B72 . All completed inventories should be submitted to the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (Chem B72 ) for compliance with the CFATS regulation.

Toxic gases are defined as gases that cause significant acute health effects at low concentrations, have a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) health rating of 3 or 4, have low occupational expos ure limits, or are pyrophoric. Examples of some common toxic gases are listed below, (there are others). If you are unsure if it is a toxic gas, consult the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for the gas or contact the EH&S Office in Chemistry oxide nitrogen dioxide arsine fluorine nitrogen trifluoride (and gas mixtures with any fluorine) 1, 3 bu tadiene germane phosphine boron dioxide sulfide hydrogen iodide vinyl chloride chlorine hydro gen selenide Many of the toxic gases listed above are on the Chemicals of Interest (COI) List in Appendix X. These gases will require special approval from the EH&S Office, in order to be purchased and/or used on campus. If you are planning to use a toxi c gas or a mixture that contains a toxic gas, and are unsure whether it is hazardous enough to be governed by the Toxic Gas Program, do not order the gas, and contact EH&S at 518-442-3495. When preparing to use a toxic gas, one or more of the following req uirements may apply to your laboratory: Exhausted cabinets or enclosures for storing toxic gas cylinders and manifolds Air flow monitors or alarms on exhausted enclosures Toxic gas sensors and alarms for the laboratory Gas distribution equipment that uses compatible materials and design Restrictive flow orifices that limit the flow rate of gas Documented safety procedures and training of lab personnel Modeling of \"worst case\" gas release scenario Secure storage EH&S must review and approve each proposed toxic gas use before the gas is obtained for that use. EH&S will determine which of the above safety measures is required on a case -by-case basis, after an evaluation of the planned research and experimental se tup. A consultant ma y be required to be brought in for further safety recommendations. In general, more stringent precautions will be applied to large quantities, continuous flow (as opposed to batch) uses of toxic gases, and to gases with poor physiological warning propertie s or gases that are highly toxic. If you have questions about the Toxic Gas Program requirements, contact th e EH&S Office at 518 -442-3495. For more safety information on compressed gases, refer to Section VI, B. Procedures for Using Compressed Gases of thi s plan. REMINDER - Even \"empty\" gas cylinders are still considered hazardous and must be disposed of appropriately. "}
