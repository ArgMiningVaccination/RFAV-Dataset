This study seeks to understand how chronic lung disease impacts SARS -CoV-2 vaccine -elicited immunity. Methods Deep immune phenotyping of humoral and cell mediated responses to the SARS -CoV-2 vaccine was performed in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an d interstitial lung disease (ILD) compared to healthy controls. Results 48% of vaccinated patients with chronic lung diseases had reduced antibody titers to the SARS -CoV-2 vaccine antigen relative to healthy controls. Vaccine antibody titers were signific antly reduced among asthma (p<0.035), COPD (p<0.022), and a subset of ILD patients as early as 3 -4 months after vaccination, correlating with decreased vaccine -specific memory B cells in circulation. Vaccine -specific memory T cells were significantly reduc ed in patients asthma (CD8+ p<0.004; CD4+ p<0.023) and COPD (CD8+ p<0.008) compared to healthy controls. Impaired T cell responsiveness was also observed in a subset of ILD patients (CD8+ 21.4%; CD4+ 42.9%). Additional heterogeneity between healthy an d disease cohorts was observed among bulk and vaccine -specific follicular T helper cells. Conclusions Deep immune phenotyping of the SARS -CoV-2 vaccine response revealed the complex nature of vaccine -elicited immunity and highlights the need for more pers onalized vaccination schemes in patients with underlying lung conditions. Introduction Vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) targeting the ancestral (Wuhan -Hu-1/2019) viral spike (S) protein has been broadly effective at limiting infection and severe coronavirus disease (COVID -19) [1-6]. With respect to SARS -CoV-2 infection, both the humoral and cell mediated arms of the adaptive response are important for achieving optimal control of COVID -19 [7]. As such, generating effective B cell and T cell immunity against SARS -CoV-2 remains the goal during vaccination. Much of the protection afforded by both the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 and the Moderna mRNA -1273 mRNA vaccines is by increased antibodies to the viral spike p rotein [8]. The efficacy of such neutralizing antibodies depends on their titer, avidity, and half -life [9-17]. In infected individuals, the half -lives of IgG anti -spike and anti -RBD have been reported to be 103 - 126 and 83 -116 days, respectively [18, 19] . The half -life of antibodies in vaccinated individuals may be shorter, as titers are significantly decreased after 6 months [20-25]. The difference in antibody half -life between infected and vaccinated individuals may depend on the half -lives of the plasma cells or differences in the memory B cells that produce them [26]. Memory B cells do not constitutively secret e soluble antibody but, after re -exposure to virus or vaccine, rapidly convert to plasma cells and can thus contribute to production of high levels of protective antibodies. cells [27]. The importance of memory B cells to lasting immunity to SARS -CoV-2 infection after vaccination is highli ghted by findings showing that RBD specific memory B cells survive even after anti -RBD antibodies are absent from serum [25, 28] . In addition to humoral immunity, SARS -CoV-2-specific T cells provide protection against the virus and may be particularly relevant in the case of SARS -CoV-2 variants of concern such as B.1.617.2 delta and B.1.1.529 omicron which express mutated spike proteins that can more effectively evade neutralizing antibodies [24, 29 -33]. The ability of the virus to escape antibody but not T cell immunity stems from the nature of the different antigenic targets on the spike protein recognized by B cells (proteins) and T cells (peptides) [7, 32, 34 -37]. Underlying their potential importance, the relative expansion of SARS -CoV-2 specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells associates with COVID -19 disease severity, and T cell memory appears more durable than serum antibody titers [18, 25, 35, 38, 39] . The rapidity of T cell responses after infectio n and vaccination also provides important protective benefits [35, 40, 41] . Circulating CD4+ follicular T helper cells (cTfh) are also found in the memory T cell pool. While SARS -CoV-2-specific Tfh cell are less durable than other memory T cell subsets after v accination and may not be required for the generation of antibodies against the virus, these cells are probably important in orchestrating a productive T and B cell response to SARS -CoV-2 infection [25, 34, 42 -46]. Although we have gained significant understanding about natural immunity and response to SARS -CoV-2 infection and vaccination, informative data were not generated in chronic lung disease patients, who are at highest risk of m ortality and morbidity due to COVID -19 [47]. Patients with lung diseases may suffer more than healthy subjects from SARS -CoV-2 infections because of underlying pulmonary limitation s and/or abnormal lung immune function. Immunosuppressant drugs taken by patients with chronic lung disease can also reduce their immune responses to the SARS -CoV-2 vaccine as reported in other disease contexts [48-52]. Indeed, certain conditions and treatments may significantly reduce the ability of patient s to produce anti-SARS -CoV-2 antibody [53-60]. Therefore, it is critical to understand th e vaccine response in high -risk chronic lung disease patients to help identify subsets of individuals who may be at greatest risk of poor outcomes. To reveal whether limitations in vaccine responsiveness exist within chronic lung disease patients and to un derstand better the heterogeneity of responses across different chronic lung diseases, we performed deep phenotyping of the humoral and cell mediated immune response to SARS -CoV-2 vaccination in a select, investigative cohort of patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma, compared to healthy subjects. Methods Study population: Chronic lung disease and healthy control blood samples were collected as part of two institutional IRB -approved protoco ls under which subjects provided informed consent: 1) a prospective study of response to SARS -CoV-2 vaccinations that recruited from NJH clinics and 2) the National Jewish Health BioBank that recruits patients undergoing normal clinical laboratory testing or from a healthy donor pool. Patient information regarding vaccine status, medicine, and infection status was collected at time of sample collection or as part of their normal medical record. For samples used, no prior SARS -CoV-2 infection was noted in me dical records at time of blood draw. All samples were taken between 6/17/2021 and 8/31/2021. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell sample preparation: Blood was collected from multiple 10 mL blood draws into EDTA tubes. Serum was processed after density gradient centrifugation and PBMC -post red blood cell DMSO + 90% FBS in cryovials prior to storage in liquid nitrogen. SARS -CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), nucleocapsid, and human ACE2 generation: SARS -CoV-2 spike 319 to 541) with C -terminal 6* histidine tag was expressed in 293F cell as described previously [61]. The SAR S-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (amino acids 247 to 364) was expressed in bacteria using plasmid NR - 52434 (B.E.I) and purified with Ni Sepharose. The RBD protein was purified with nickel column. Both RBD and nucleocapsid were eluted (20 mM Tris pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 250 mM Imidazole) and purified proteins concentrated with Amicon centrifugal tubes with a 10 KD cutoff filter. Proteins were then separated on the Superdex 200 10/300 GL size exclusion column with PBS as running buffer to collect monomers. Human ACE2 (1-615) fused to mouse IgG 2a (ACE2 -mFc) was expressed in the human 293F cell line as previously reported [62]. The fusion protein was purified with protein A and eluted with 0.1M glycine buffer pH3.0. competition assay to assess the function of serum antibody in blocking ACE2 binding to spike of Bamlanivimab or serum at 1:10 dilution. The mixture was then incubated with spike RBD coated ELISA plate. The binding of ACE2 -mFc to RBD was detected by AP histidine tag and Avitag was expressed and purified in the same way above. The RBD was biotinylated by BirA enzyme. The biotinylated Nucleocapsid was used for coating ELISA plate. After blocking, human serum at different dilutions was incubated on the plates. The bound IgG was detected with 1:50 dilution of goat anti - human IgG, Fc fragment specific conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Jackson ImmunoResearch). This was similarly done for bound IgM using an AP -conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmnoResearch). Bamlanivimab was used as standard for converting ELISA O.D. value to serum antibody amount [64]. Pre-pandemic biobank sera was used as a negative control. The value for positive nucleocapsid antibody testing is set as 2 -fold of negative control. QuantiVac EUROIMMUNE Assay: Serum was diluted 1:100 according to manufacturer instructions and IgG anti SARS -Co-V2 spike protein antibodies wer e detected by ELISA, using QuantiVAC anti -SARS -CoV-2 (IgG) kit This kit the recombinant S1 domain of the SARS -CoV-2 spike protein to coat the wells. Results were reported as a qualitative interpretation (positive, negative, or borderline for antibody) and as a semi -quantitative value expressed as RU/mL (relative units). The linear range of the assay was established in the lab as 8 -95 RU/mL and the reference range as < 8 RU/mL. Samples with val ues above the linear range were further diluted 1:4 and rerun. If results were above the linear range when run at this dilution, they were reported as > 380 RU/mL. Staining of RBD specific B cell subsets by flow cytometry: Human PBMC samples were obtained from Biobank at National Jewish Health. PBMC were thawed, enriched by ficoll gradient centrifugation, and stained with 2 \u00b5g/ml double with block and FITC then added for staining. Cells were washed and stained with Ghost UV450 dye and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde f or flow cytometry analysis. PBMC cultures and antigen -specific T cell stimulation: streptomycin). After count ing, PBMC were stained with 5uM cell proliferation dye eFluor 670 (CPD; #65 - 0840, Thermo Fisher). CPD labeled cells were plated at 2x105 PBMC per well in cRPMI + 2ng/mL (10U/mL) of recombinant human IL -2 (Biolegend). For RBD stimulation, wells were incubat ed with 2.5ug/mL of RBD protein (amino acids 319 -541 of Spike protein) or media alone for 5 days. For cytokine analysis, on day 5 of culture, cells were left unstimulated or were stimulated with 50ng/mL phorbol 12 -mryistate 13 (PMA; Sigma) and 1ug/ mL of ionomycin (Sigma -Aldrich) 4 hours before harvest. All wells were provided 10ug/mL of brefeldin A (Sigma -Aldrich) and by flow labeled with LIVE/DEAD fixable set (#00 -5523 -00, Biolegend). were collected by flow cytometric analysis on a LSR II (BD Biosciences) cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo (BD Bioscience). Statistical Analysis: All comparisons were made using paired and unpaired t tests with Prism 9 (GraphPad). Where possible p values and r correlations are provided directly in figures. P values in grouped graphs represent unpaired, two -tailed T test. Results A subset of patients with chronic lung disease exhibit reduced serum antibody titers after vaccination agains t SARS -CoV-2. Serum samples were used to -CoV-2 vaccine (Pfizer -BioNTech BNT162b2, Moderna mRNA -1273, and Janssen) responsiveness in a cohort of 9 asthma, 8 COPD, and 15 ILD patients and 31 healthy controls (Table 1). To investigate the humoral response, we performed an in -house quantitative ELISA for serum SARS - CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike RBD -specific antibodies. Serum collected between 14 - 231 days after the last vaccination/boost was analyzed. Asthma (p<0.035) and COPD (p<0.022) patients show ed significantly reduced antibody titers 3 -4 months after vaccination compared to healthy controls (Fig. 1A). 40% (6/15) of ILD patients also exhibited reduced antibody titers compared to healthy subjects. To validate these findings, serum titers from the in-house (semiquantitative Spike protein IgG) were compared. As expected, samples with the highest serum anti -RBD titers, including 100% of healthy controls, were most prominent in the highest anti -spike titer bin (>350 b inding antibody units (BAU)/mL) while those showing low anti -RBD titers were enriched in the lowest bin (<150 BAU/mL) (Fig. 1B). Although no prior infection was noted at the time of blood collection, 16% of the samples showed evidence of prior SARS -CoV-2 infection based on anti -nucleocapsid antibody titers in the serum that were 2 -fold higher than a pre -pandemic control sample (Fig. 1C). To investigate how prior infection was influencing anti -RBD antibody titers in Fig. 1A, we compared where individua ls with prior infection (open circles) fell on the graphs. While some asthma and ILD patients with prior viral exposure showed similar serum anti -RBD titers as healthy controls, some asthma and COPD patients with prior SARS -CoV-2 exposure still exhibited l ow anti -RBD antibody titers. Thus, while natural infection may complement the vaccine response in some patients with chronic lung disease, it does not boost vaccine titers in others suggesting that hybrid immunity (natural infection + vaccination = improve d protection) may be compromised in at least some patients with chronic lung disease [65, 66] . Because individuals with ILD, asthma, and COPD were more likely to exhibit reduced antibody responses after vaccination, we investigate if serum from these individuals was less likely to neutralize virus. To do this we performed an ACE2 -mFc competition assay. In this assay, the antibodies with recombinant -mFc -the receptor that binds RBD - for RBD binding. More neutralization capacity of the serum results in better blocking of ACE2 -mFc. This manifests as less ACE2 -mFc detection in the assay. Consistent with our prior work and others, 94% of serum from vaccinated healthy controls exhibited good blocking activity over the first 3 -5 months post vaccination (Fig. 1D). In contrast , only 22% of patients with ILD, asthma, or COPD showed good blocking activity over this same time span. The limited blocking activity in patients with chronic lung disease was independent of prior infection history as some patients with nucleocapsid antib odies also showed limited blocking activity in this assay. Together, these investigative findings suggest that many patients with ILD, asthma, and COPD may not achieve or maintain the same level of humoral protection after vaccination as healthy subjects. Circulating spike -specific B cells are reduced in patients with chronic lung disease. To investigate vaccine -specific memory B cells, we enriched PBMC for B cells and identified RBD -specific B cells using double colored RBD -tetramers (Fig. 2A,B) [67]. We minimized contamination of non -RBD -specific B cells by eliminating B cells that bound in PBMC taken pre -pandemic (Fig. 2B). Individuals with ILD (p<0.012) and asthma (p<0.032) had significantly fewer circulating RBD -specific B cells than healthy controls ( Fig. 2C). COPD patients on average had fewer RBD -specific B cells within the circulating B cell population than observed in healthy controls (Fig. 2C). Of note, recent SARS -CoV-2 infection based on anti -nucleocapsid antibodies in the serum did not appear t o impact the percentage of RBD -specific memory B cells (Fig. 2C). This appears consistent with reports showing that recent viral infection can impede B cell responses after boosting with the vaccine [70]. When RBD -specific B cells from all patients were compared to their RBD -specific serum antibody titers, a significan t correlation (r=0.477; p<0.002) was observed (Fig. 2D). While the strongest positive correlation was observed in healthy subjects (r=0.572), ILD patients (r=0.588; p<0.021) also correlated. Together, these data indicate that many individuals with chronic lung disease fail to generate a robust pool of circulating vaccine - specific B cells compared to healthy controls. T cell response to SARS -CoV-2 vaccination is impaired in patients with chronic lung disease. To investigate the RBD -specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses in a way that was agnostic to a patient's HLA type, we used a modified approach previously described to efficiently detect spike -responsive T cells in the blood of patients with mild COVID -19 [42]. This approach identifies RBD -reactive T cells based on their loss of cell proliferation dye (Fig. 2A). Using this approach, subsets of individuals with underlying lung conditions exhibited diminished RBD -specific T cell resp onses compared to healthy 3B, C). Specifically, CD8+ (p<0.004) and CD4+ (p<0.023) T cell responses in asthma patients were significantly reduced, as were CD8+ (p<0.008) T cell responses in COPD patients. Of note, 21% of ILD patients showed l imited CD8+ T cell responses and 42% failed to evoke a robust CD4+ T cell response after vaccination. Similarly, 33 -37.5% of asthmatic and COPD patients had no observable CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to the vaccine antigen. Similar to our findings with R BD-specific antibodies and memory B cells, prior SARS -CoV-2 infection did not have an obvious impact on the percentage of RBD -specific CD8+ or CD4+ T cells in this exploratory cohort. This indicates that prior infection in some patients with chronic lung d isease does not enhance T cell mediated immunity after vaccination. This again may suggest that hybrid immunity is impaired in a subset of ILD, asthma, and COPD patients . To find out if humoral and cell mediated immunity w ere impacted similarly in our patient pool after vaccination, we compared RBD -specific T cell responses to serum RBD -specific T cell responsiveness correlated strongly (r=0.728; p<0.0001) with CD8+ T cell vaccine responses across disease cohorts, no correlation was observed between RBD -specific T cell responses and RBD -specific antibody titers (Fig. 3D -F). This suggests that an individual's humoral response to vaccine can be independent of their vaccine -elicited T cell immunity and vice versa. Vaccine -specific T cells in patients with chronic lung conditions have impaired cytokine potential. To address T cell function, the cytokine potential of T cells in our patient cohorts was assayed by intracellular cytokine staining. While the percentages of bulk CD8+ T ce lls that were IFN - competent were significantly (p<0.012) elevated among vaccinated COPD patients compared to healthy controls, the percentage of such cells in asthmatic and ILD patients were not significantly different (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, the percentage of bulk C D8 T cells from asthmatic patients that could produce IL -2 were significantly (p<0.014) reduced relative to healthy controls (Fig. 4A). While this suggests some heterogeneity exi sts in the cytokine profiles of patients with chronic lung disease, for the mo st part , bulk T cell function appears similar across disease groups. Even less heterogeneity was observed in the cytokine potential of CD4+ T cells across disease groups and healthy patients (Fig. 4B). In contrast to bulk T cell populations, heterogeneity in cytokine potential was observed in vaccine -responsive T cell populations. In these experiments vaccine responsive T cells were defined by loss of the cell staining dye CPD, indicative of cells that had divided in response to RBD antigen. In patients wi th chronic lung disease , the percentage of RBD responsive CD8+ T cells from asthma and COPD patients that could produce IFN - and/or IL -2 was significantly reduced compared to similar T cells obtained from healthy subjects (Fig. 4C, D). A similar finding w as observed in RBD responsive CD4+ T cells from asthma and COPD patients (Fig. 4E, F). Of note, while asthma and COPD patients showed more homogeneity in their T cell functionality, a subset of patients with ILD also exhibited decreased IFN -gamma and IL -2 within RBD -specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to healthy controls. This suggests that at least some patients within each disease cohort exhibit reduced T cell functionality to the vaccine. No obvious difference was observed when individuals within eac h disease group were binned based on prior or recent SARS -CoV-2 infection (presence of anti - nucleocapsid antibodies). When looking at total T cell responsiveness, patients mounting a productive CD4+ T cell response generally exhibited a productive CD8+ T c ell response (r=0.703; p<0.0001) (Fig. 4G). To understand if T cell function similarly tracked with humoral immunity after vaccination, we compared IFN -gamma+ RBD -specific T cells in each patient to their serum anti -RBD titers. In all patient groups, no si gnificant correlation was observed (Fig. 4H, I). Together with serum antibody and memory B cell data, these findings indicate that the SARS -CoV-2 vaccine may differentially promote T cell and humoral immunity in some ILD, asthma, and COPD patients. SARS -CoV-2-specific Tfh cells exhibit decreased cytokine potential in patients with chronic lung conditions compared to healthy controls. Given Tfh cells are important in driving humoral vaccine responses, we next investigated the Tfh response in vaccinated pat ients with pulmonary disease. The percentage of circulating CXCR5+ CD4+ Tfh (cTfh) cells among the total CD4+ T cell pool was decreased across all disease cohorts reaching significance within asthma (p<0.011) and COPD (p<0.006) patients (Fig. 5A). While IL -2 production remained comparable to healthy controls, the relative percentage of IFN - expressing cTfh cells was increased across all chronic lung disease cohorts (Fig. 5B). Increased IFN - production was most evident in COPD (p<0.027) patients, however, at least some ILD and asthma patients also exhibited increased interferon expression within bulk cTfh cells relative to healthy controls. Despite the increased IFN - production observed in bulk cTfh cells in patients with chronic lung disease, RBD -responsi ve (CPD -lo) cTfh on average exhibited decreased IFN - production compared to vaccinated, healthy controls reaching significance in asthma patients (Fig. 5C). In fact, 21% of ILD patients, 44% of asthma patients, and 25% of COPD patients in this investigat ive cohort lacked IFN -- expressing RBD -responsive Tfh cells above background (Fig. 5C). This mirrors the decreased functionality of vaccine responsive T cells within non -Tfh cell populations. Discussion This study highlights the significant heterogeneity that exists in the vaccine response to SARS -CoV-2 in individuals with ILD, COPD and asthma compared to healthy controls. In our assessment of vaccine -induced antibody titers, memory B cell subsets, and T cells in patients with asthma, COPD, and ILD, we found that 48.3% of patients with chronic lung disease exhibited serum antibody titers to the vaccine antigen below the expected titers observed in healthy controls 3 -4 months after the last vaccine administ ration. This correlated with decreased RBD -specific circulating memory B cells. Importantly, while serum antibodies generated by healthy controls showed good \"neutralization\" activity, the vast majority of ILD, COPD, and asthma patients showed poor \"neutra lization\" activity, even during the first 3 -4 months post vaccination. In addition, most patients with asthma and COPD and a subset of patients with ILD had reduced circulating RBD -responsive CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and Tfh cells. Of note, while most chronic lung disease patients showed impaired vaccine responsiveness, many patients exhibited defects in only one arm of the adaptive response (humoral and cell mediated) to SARS -CoV-2 vaccination. This highlights the considerable variability in vaccine re sponses among patients with chronic lung disease and illustrates the importance of deep immunophenotyping of high -risk patients to determine their overall immunity to SARS -CoV-2 after vaccination. While the limited sample size prevents firm conclusions, an interesting observation within this small exploratory study was a failure to see enhanced vaccine responses in individuals who had evidence of a recent SARS -CoV-2 exposure. It has been shown that prior infection can promote more robust B and T cell respon se to the vaccine, and this hybrid immunity is associated with less severe COVID -19 [65, 66] . It is possible that natural exposures to SARS -CoV-2 in this setting occurred after vaccination, which has been linked to reduced antibody responses and memory B cell generation [70]. If and how hybrid immunity is impacted in patients with ILD, asthma, and COPD warrants further investigation, as these individuals would appear to be at greater risk for developing more severe disease if hybrid immunity is impaired. This evident lack of robust hybrid immunity in patients with chronic lung disease is likely to become more clinically relevant over time, as it appears that ongoing vaccination efforts are transitioning to a yearly dose, similar to traditional vaccination for influenza. In tha t regard, understanding how immune responses to both natural infection and vaccination differ between chronic lung disease patients and healthy controls is likely key to understanding how to evoke lasting protection. While not designed or powered to addres s safety, efficacy, or durability of the vaccine response in patients with chronic lung disease, the current data suggest that what we understand regarding vaccination in healthy subjects may not be directly applicable to patients with chronic lung disease . Further, the data also show that vaccine responses may differ depending on the type of underlying lung condition. For example, as a group, individuals with COPD and asthma were more likely to exhibit impaired antibody and T cell responses than ILD patien ts, who instead exhibited greater heterogeneity in their mRNA vaccine response. Factors that separate responders from non-responders within a particular disease group may reflect distinct disease - associated endotypes within COPD, asthma, and ILD, including the possibility that subsets of each of these lung diseases are associated with broadly abnormal immunity, a concept that finds support in previous studies [71]. Another likely factor co ntributing to the varied vaccine responses observed across these pulmonary disease cohorts are medicines used to treat chronic lung disease. Immunosuppressants (e.g. biologics and/or prednisone) represent one class of drugs often prescribed to patients with ILD (e.g. sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity and connective tissue disorder -ILD) and asthma to control disease pathobiology and symptoms. Future studies are needed to dissect the intrinsic impact of the disease from extrinsic factors that are impeding vaccination efficacy in patients with ILD, asthma, and COPD. A key caveat in the current study is the lack of a longitudinal assessment within these different disease cohorts. We know from healthy controls that each arm of the immune system varies over time after vaccination. For example, while anti -RBD antibody titers and cTfh numbers wane six months after vaccination, vaccine -specific T cell responses and memory B cell responses remain relatively stable over that same period in healthy subjects [25, 72] . Whether similar kinetics occur in individuals with chronic lung disease remains unknown. The investigative data provided herein suggest that a large percentage of individuals with chronic lung disease fail to mount productive humoral and cell mediated im munity during the first and second dosing of the vaccine. What remains unclear is whether such non -responders remain impaired after subsequent vaccination attempts. While there is evidence that a third booster can be effective in providing some protection against SARS -CoV-2 in other high -risk populations [56, 73 -75], some seronegative individuals who did not respond to the first two doses of vaccine also fail to respond to the third boost [76]. Thus, the benefit of multiple boosts or more frequent boosting in subsets of patients with asthma, ILD, and COPD that show inadequate vaccine responsiveness should be explored. Another caveat of the current study is that it focused solely on the circulating RBD -responsive IgG antibody, memory B cell, and T cell responses post vaccination. While the data are certa inly consistent with impaired vaccine responses within these circulating populations, natural infection can induce tissue -resident and mucosal immunity that may not be adequately reflected in the current data [77]. Indeed, serum IgA -a reflection of mucosal immunity - against SARS -CoV-2 generated after natural infection or vaccination corresponds to protection against the virus [78, 79] . Furthermore, while pr otective antibody responses to the vaccine largely concentrate to the RBD portion of the spike protein, the T cell repertoire to the vaccine is more heterogeneous [80]. Many vaccine -responsive T cells recognize antigens outside of the RBD, and these would not have been identified based on the protocols used in this study. Whether individuals with ILD, asthma, and COPD possess impaired mucosal responses in addition to t hose observed here and whether such individuals exhibit similarly impaired T cell responses to vaccine epitopes that lie outside of the RBD regions remain important areas of future investigation. In conclusion, while limited in sample size, this explorator y study suggests that efficacy of the vaccine and vaccine -induced immunity in healthy individuals should not be uniformly extrapolated to individuals with chronic lung disease. This finding has clinical relevance, as these individuals are considered at hig h-risk for contracting severe COVID -19. Patients with COPD, for example, have increased odds of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mortality compared to healthy controls if exposed to SARS -CoV-2 [47]. Given the relatively high pe rcentage of patients with chronic lung disease showing some form of impaired vaccine responsiveness and the high degree of heterogeneity in the responses observed across individuals with ILD, asthma, and COPD, chronic lung disease patients may benefit from personalized vaccination schemes and deeper assessment of immune responses to ensure optimal protection in this vulnerable population.
