They will develop their research capabilities, drive innovative programmes of work and deliver significant shifts in understanding that could improve human life, health and wellbeing. Scheme at a glance - Where your administering organisation is based: - UK, Republic of Ireland, [Low- or middle-income countries (apart from India and mainland China)](/grant-funding/guidance/low-and-middle-income-countries) - Level of funding: You should ask for your salary (if required) and the resources you need for your research programme - see the 'What we offer' section on this page. You will need to justify this in your application. - Duration of funding: Usually 8 years, but may be less for some disciplines and may only be longer if held on a part-time basis. Eligibility and suitability You can apply for a Wellcome Career Development Award if you are a mid-career researcher and you are ready to lead a substantial and innovative research programme. You must aim to make a key contribution to your field by: - generating significant shifts in understanding and/or - developing methodologies, conceptual frameworks, tools or techniques that could benefit health-related research. During the award, we expect you to: - develop your research capabilities and leadership skills - support others to undertake research responsibly and promote a positive and inclusive culture - start training the next generation of researchers and develop their research skills and careers. Your research can be in any discipline - including science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), experimental medicine, humanities and social science, clinical/allied health sciences, and public health - as long as it has the potential to improve human life, health and wellbeing, and aligns with our [funding remit](/grant-funding/guidance/discovery-research-schemes-remit). Career stage and experience To be eligible, you will already be driving your own research. You must have: - completed one or two substantial periods of research after your initial training - made important contributions to your area of research. You will probably have experience of working collaboratively. You may have directed, or closely guided, the work of others. At the point of application, you may also have been appointed to: - your first permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contract, or to a tenure track contract. If this applies to you, you cannot ask for your own salary with this award unless you are based in a low- or middle-income country and your contract states you must get salary from external grant funding. - a fixed term position with four years or less remaining on your contract at the point of application. If this applies to you, you can ask for your own salary with this award. If your contractual circumstances change between the point of application and your award activation you must tell us immediately as this may change your eligibility for salary. We will not normally supplement for salary funds after the award has been made (see our [supplementary grant funding page](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/supplementary-grant-funding)for more information). If after two or more years of your CDA activating your organisation awards you a permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contract that includes your salary, you will be able to keep the salary element of the award to use towards your remaining research costs. - a fixed term position with more than four years left on your contract at the point of application. If this applies to you, you cannot ask for your salary with this award and your host organisation must underwrite your salary costs for the duration of the award. You must be able to contribute at least 80% of your research time to the award. For permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contracts, you must have been appointed within the last three years unless, during this time, you: - spent time away from research due to personal circumstances (for example, for a career break, maternity leave, long-term sick leave or a chronic illness) - worked part-time and research was not part of the role, for example, if you have been employed as a healthcare professional - changed research discipline, for example, moving from astrophysics to computational neuroscience, or environmental chemistry to social anthropology. There may be some crossover, such as in research sites or techniques, but the shift should still be a significant change. - were based in a low- or middle-income country where it is normal to be appointed to a permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contract early in your research career. If the three-year limit falls between two deadlines for this scheme, and you would benefit from applying to the second deadline, we will allow you to do this. If you hold a proleptic appointment, you can request your salary costs from Wellcome for the duration of the award. If you are a health professional, you will have completed your clinical training. If you want to continue with clinical activities, you must be registered with, and licensed by, the relevant professional regulator in the country you intend to work in. Read our [Q&As for health professionals](/grant-funding/guidance/discovery-research-schemes-health-professionals-common-questions). By the end of the award By the end of the award, you should have achieved international standing in your area of research. You should also have the skills and experience to apply for permanent positions at research organisations. Host organisation You must have sponsorship from an [eligible host organisation](/grant-funding/guidance/eligibility-information-grant-applicants) in one of the following: - UK - Republic of Ireland - a [low- or middle-income country](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/low-and-middle-income-countries)(apart from India and mainland China). It can be a: - higher education institution - research institute - non-academic healthcare organisation - not-for-profit organisation. Time spent away from research You can apply if you've been away from research (for example a career break, maternity leave, or long-term sick leave). We'll allow for this when we consider your application. Depending on your previous career stage and the level of supervision and retraining you need now, you may also want to consider an [Early-Career Award](/grant-funding/schemes/early-career-awards). Resubmissions [If you are unsuccessful with an application to this scheme, you can submit one more full application for the same project. Significant changes are needed for the second application. You do not need to contact us first.] Current Wellcome grantholders We will allow current grantholders of the following mid-career schemes to apply for a Career Development Award until the end of their awards, unless they have been appointed to a permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contract: - Sir Henry Dale Fellowships (including those with extensions) - Research Career Development Fellowships - Research Career Re-entry Fellowships - Intermediate Clinical Fellowships (including those with one-year extensions) - Clinical Research Career Development Fellowships (stage 2) - International Intermediate Fellowships. If you are one of these grantholders, you must have an active grant at the time of application. Other Wellcome awards During a Career Development Award, you can be a coapplicant on up to two other Wellcome awards. In your application for the second award where you are a co-applicant you must explain: - why no other applicant or co-applicant can provide the expertise that you bring to the project - how you will manage your research commitments across the three awards. Assessment criteria We will review your research proposal, skills and experience, and research environment. Your research proposal To be competitive, your research proposal will be: - Bold. It aims to deliver a significant shift in understanding and/or it provides a significant advance over existing methodologies, conceptual frameworks, tools or techniques. It has the potential to stimulate new and innovative research. - Creative. Your proposed approach is novel - it develops and tests new concepts, methods or technologies, or combines existing ideas and approaches in a new way. - High quality. It is well-designed, clear, supported by evidence and the proposed outcomes/outputs are feasible. Your skills and experience We will review: - your research outputs and contributions to the research community - your experience of, and contribution to, developing other researchers - your leadership and management skills, and how you plan to develop these during the award. Your research environment We will review: - how you will contribute to the strategic aims of your organisation - how your research environment(s) will help you develop your research capabilities and leadership and management skills - how you will contribute to a positive and inclusive research culture. Who can't apply You are not eligible to apply if: - you hold, or have held, an equivalent award at this career stage (an exception to this is that our [current Wellcome grantholders](#currentgrantholders)at an equivalent stage can apply to this scheme) - you have made an application to this scheme and you are waiting for a decision. You cannot apply to carry out activities that involve the transfer of grant funds into mainland China. What's expected of your host organisation You must be based at an eligible organisation that can sign up to our [grant conditions](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/grant-conditions). We expect organisations based in the UK to meet the responsibilities required by the [Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/supporting-career-development-researchers) for institutions, managers and researchers. Any organisation with Wellcome funding that is based outside the UK is expected, at a minimum, to follow the principles of the Concordat. We also expect your host organisation to: - Give you, and any staff employed on the grant, 10 days a year (pro rata if part-time) to undertake training and continuing professional development (CPD) in line with the Concordat. This should include the responsible conduct of research, research leadership, people management, diversity and inclusion, and the promotion of a healthy research culture. - Provide a system of onboarding, embedding and planning for you when you join the organisation and/or start the award. - Provide you with the status and benefits of other academic staff of similar seniority. Your host organisation must guarantee they will: - provide you with a permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contract by the end of the award or - carry out a formal review process, no less than two years before the end of your award, to discuss your future at the organisation, including the possibility of a permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contract. This does not apply to applicants who already have a permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contract. If your host organisation is a core-funded research organisation, a Career Development Award should not replace or lead to a reduction in existing or planned core support. Sponsor Your sponsor must hold an established post (or an honorary academic appointment) at the host organisation for the duration of the award. They will be expected to: - Guarantee the space and resources you'll need from the start date to the end date of your award. - Ensure the research environment will support you to complete your programme. - Explain how your research fits with the strategic aims of the organisation. - Confirm workload expectations with you - you should not spend more than 20% of your time on non-research related activities, for example clinical duties, teaching or administration. If you're based in a clinical craft specialty, you may spend up to 40% of your time on clinical duties. - Organise a discussion about your future at the organisation, for example an appointment to a permanent position. If you plan to work for more than three months outside your host organisation, you must also have an additional sponsor at that location who will guarantee the space and resources you'll need during your visit. Mentor You should also identify a mentor for the period of your award. They should have a track record in training and mentorship, and support and guide you on how to: - manage your application - develop your research career - progress with your personal development - manage the processes and regulations at your host organisation (although they do not need to be based at your organisation). Your sponsor can also be your mentor. What we offer A Wellcome Career Development Award provides a salary for the grantholder (if required) and research expenses. The award usually lasts for 8 years, but may be less for some disciplines, such as humanities and social science. The award may be held on a part-time basis. We will extend the duration of the award to reflect this. You should ask for a level and duration of funding that's justifiable for your proposed research. You can only hold one of these awards. We do not offer renewals. The award includes: We will provide your salary if: - you do not have a post, or - you have a temporary or fixed-term post with four years or less remaining on your contract. If you have a permanent post, you can only ask for your salary if you are based in a low- or middle-income country and you hold a permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contract that states that you have to get your salary from external grant funding. Your host organisation must confirm: - that your employment contract states you must get salary recovery from external grant funding - that they will underwrite the salary and post for the period of time that you will be working on the grant. We will fund the total cost of your salary for the entire period of the grant. You can only receive one salary. Your salary should be based on the pay scales of the host organisation that will be employing you. It should include: - your basic salary - employer's contributions, including any statutory obligations (for example, National Insurance contributions if you're based in the UK) and pension scheme costs - any incremental progression up the salary scale - locally recognised allowances such as London allowance. You should not include: - any potential promotion costs - any Wellcome fellowship supplement that was part of a previous grant. If your host organisation is in a low- or middle-income country and you will be working in a high-income country for four weeks or more, you should be paid at an appropriate rate for that country, according to your age and experience. You should only allow for salary pay awards during Year 1. These should be based on pay awards already agreed. If the pay award is not yet known, applicants should use the International Monetary Fund inflation rate, selecting the 'inflation, average consumer price' option as indicator. From Year 2 onwards, we will automatically increase your salary, based on our current inflation allowance rates. If you are a clinical academic, your salary should be appropriate to your clinical status and within the salary scale for academic and senior clinical lecturers. If you're paid on a non-clinical salary scale, your basic salary should be in line with academics of a similar seniority. Read about the [responsibilities of grantholders and host organisations for people working on a Wellcome grant](/grant-funding/guidance/people-working-wellcome-grant). Teaching buyout If you're a humanities and social sciences researcher, you can ask for funds for teaching replacement to cover the cost of a temporary replacement lecturer. You must retain at least a 10% commitment to teaching. Costs: - can cover up to 33% FTE of your contracted time - are usually for a person at a more junior level than the postholder - can be spread across the full period of the grant. If you already get buyout costs from another grant (funded by Wellcome or elsewhere), you can ask us for this cost, but only for the period of time on your Career Development Award when you won't receive buyout costs from another grant. You must provide a letter from your employing organisation, confirming that your contract includes a teaching commitment. You should include this in your grant application. Visa and work permit costs If Wellcome is going to pay your salary on the grant, you can ask for visa and work permit costs to help you take up the post at your host organisation. Award holders who need a visa to work in the UK may be eligible for a [Global Talent Visa](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/global-talent-visa). You can also ask for: - visa costs for your partner and dependent children - Immigration Health Surcharge costs for you, your partner and dependent children if you will be in the UK for six months or more - essential associated costs, such as travel to attend appointments at a visa application centre or embassy, and English language tests, if you can justify these. We will cover the salary costs of up to 4 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) staff, full or part-time, who will work on your project. Staff members typically include research assistants or technicians employed on your grant. You can ask for more staff costs (in addition to the 4 FTE staff) if you need: - specialist service staff, for example data analysis, fieldwork and clinical studies - support because you or a member of staff employed on your grant is disabled or has a long-term health condition - see 'Disability-related adjustment support'. We do not provide studentships on this award. But if you employ a research assistant on your grant, you can ask for the costs to cover their PhD fees. You can ask for PhD fees for one research assistant at a time on your grant. Staff salaries should be appropriate to skills, responsibilities and expertise. You should ask your host organisation to use their salary scales to calculate these costs, which should include: - basic salary - employer's contributions, including any statutory obligations (for example, National Insurance contributions if you're based in the UK) and pension scheme costs - Apprentice Levy charges for UK-based salaries - any incremental progression up the salary scale - locally recognised allowances such as London allowance. You should allow for salary pay awards during Year 1. If the pay award is not yet known, applicants should use the International Monetary Fund inflation rate, selecting the 'inflation, average consumer price' option as indicator. From Year 2 onwards, you should use your organisation's current pay rates. We'll provide a separate inflation allowance for salary inflation costs. Read about the [responsibilities of grantholders and host organisations for people working on a Wellcome grant](/grant-funding/guidance/people-working-wellcome-grant). If you have named people on your grant whose salaries will be funded by Wellcome, you can ask for visa or work permit costs to help them take up their posts at the host organisation. You can also ask for: - visa costs for the person's partner and dependent children - essential associated costs, such as travel to attend appointments at a visa application centre or embassy, and essential English language tests - Immigration Health Surcharge costs for the person, their partner and dependent children if they will be in the UK for six months or more. If you or a member of staff working on your grant is disabled or has a long-term health condition, you can ask for adjustment support to help you carry out your project. Costs can include, but are not limited to: - additional costs for staff to help with day-to-day activities related to your project - assistive technology to help use computers, research equipment or materials - for example, text to audio software - care costs for assistance animals if you need to travel. We will not pay for capital or building costs, such as access ramps. You can ask for these costs if your government and/or employer: - does not cover any of the costs - only covers some of the costs (if they do, we will only meet the shortfall). The costs we provide must not replace the support you may get from the government or your organisation, who are responsible for providing these costs. If you don't know what these costs are now, you can [ask for them after we've awarded your grant](/grant-funding/guidance/disability-related-support-for-grantholders). You can ask for costs to cover the following types of training. Continuing professional development and professional skills training You can ask for a contribution towards these costs. Types of training can include: - research leadership, professional and people management skills - career development support - responsible conduct of research - diversity and inclusion - promotion of a healthy research culture. We expect your host organisation to provide and fund this training. However, if these types of training are not available, or the quality is inadequate, you can ask for up to \u00a3500 a year for you and each member of staff employed on your grant who will be: - in a post of 12 months duration or more only and - working on Wellcome funded awards for at least 50% full time equivalent. You will need to justify these costs in your application. Research skills training You can ask for costs to cover training for the technical and research skills you need to deliver your proposed research. You can ask for whatever research skills training you need for you, and each member of staff employed on your grant, who will be: - in a post of 12 months duration or more only and - working on Wellcome funded awards for at least 50% full time equivalent. You will need to justify these costs in your application. We will pay for the materials and consumables you need to carry out your project, including: - laboratory chemicals and materials (for example reagents, isotopes, peptides, enzymes, antibodies, gases, proteins, cell/tissue/bacterial culture, plasticware and glassware) - project-specific personal protective equipment (PPE) that is above the standard expected for the setting - printing associated with fieldwork and empirical research - associated charges for shipping, delivery and freight. You can ask for funds to buy animals if they are essential to your project. We will also fund the charge-out rates for animal house facilities if your organisation uses full economic costing methodology. These costs include: - running costs (including animal maintenance, any experimental procedures, licences and relevant staff training) - appropriate estates costs - cage and equipment depreciation costs, but not building depreciation costs. We may not pay the full charge-out rate for an animal house facility if we've provided significant funding towards the infrastructure and/or core support of the facility. If your organisation does not use full economic costing methodology to establish charge-out rates for animal house facilities, you can ask for funds to cover: - the cost of buying animals - running costs (including animal maintenance, any experimental procedures, licences and relevant staff training) - staff costs, for example, contributions towards the salaries of animal house technicians. We will not provide estates or depreciation costs. Equipment purchase You can ask for basic items of equipment that are essential to your research project. Costs may include purchase, delivery, installation, maintenance and training, where necessary. We will cover VAT and import duties if: - the usual UK exemptions on equipment used for medical research don't apply - you're applying from a non-UK organisation, and you can show these costs can't be recovered. You can also ask for specialised equipment if: - it is essential to the success of the proposed research project - it is not available at your host organisation or through collaboration, and - you'll be the main user and have priority access to the equipment. If a complete piece of specialised equipment costs \u00a3100,000 or more, we expect a contribution of at least 25% of the total costs, including maintenance, from the host organisation or another source. In some cases, we may expect a larger contribution. We'll discuss this with you after we've assessed your application. Contributions can include benefits in kind, such as refurbishment or the underwriting of a key support post. Multi-component items must not be broken down into component parts to avoid this contribution. Equipment maintenance We will cover maintenance costs for equipment if: - you are requesting it in your application - it is existing equipment that is: - funded by us or another source - essential to the proposed research project - more than five years old - cost effective to keep maintaining it. We won't cover maintenance costs for equipment if there is a mechanism in place to recoup these costs through access charges. Computer equipment We will cover the cost of one personal computer or laptop per person up to \u00a31,500. We won't pay for: - more expensive items, unless you can justify them - installation or training costs. You can ask for the cost of access to shared equipment, facilities or services if they're essential to your project. These may include materials and consumables, plus a proportion of: - maintenance and service contracts - staff time costs for dedicated technical staff employed to operate the equipment or facility. We don't cover the costs of: - estates and utilities - depreciation or insurance - other staff, for example, contributions towards departmental technical, administrative and management staff time. We do cover these costs if related to animal housing facilities. If the facilities or equipment were paid for by a Wellcome grant, you can only ask for access charges if: - the grant has ended - any support for running costs and maintenance contracts has ended. You can ask for overheads if your grant will be based at a: - university outside the UK or Republic of Ireland - research organisation that does not receive core funding for overheads - charitable or not-for-profit organisation - small or medium-sized commercial organisation. You can also ask for overheads on any part of your grant that is sub-contracted to any of the organisations listed above. If you're based at a UK university you can't ask for overheads for sub-contracted activity if your university will include the sub-contracted funding in its annual report to the UK Charity Research Support Fund. Overheads can include: - estates, for example building and premises - non-project dedicated administrative and support staff - administration, for example finance, library, and room hire. The total cost for overheads should not be more than: - 20% of the direct research costs if you're based in a low- or middle-income country - 15% of the direct research costs if you're based anywhere else. These costs must directly support the activity funded by the grant. How to apply for these costs In your grant application you must: - give a full breakdown of costs (you can't ask for a percentage of the research costs) - explain why these costs are necessary for your research - include a letter from the finance director of your host organisation, or the sub-contracted organisation, confirming that the breakdown is a true representation of the costs incurred. Conference attendance You can ask for a contribution towards the costs of attending scientific and academic meetings and conferences, including registration fees. The limits are: - Grantholder - \u00a32,000 a year - Research and technical staff on your grant - \u00a31,000 each a year We provide costs to cover caring responsibilities if you or any staff employed on your grant attend a conference. This includes childcare and any other caring responsibility you have. We will pay these if: - Wellcome is providing the salary - the conference is directly related to the research - the caring costs are over and above what they'd normally pay for care - the conference organiser and their employing organisation are unable to cover the costs. You can ask for up to \u00a31,000 per person for each conference. Collaborative travel You can ask for travel and subsistence costs for collaborative visits for you and any staff employed on your grant. You'll need to justify each visit and its duration. Other travel We will pay for other essential visits, for example to facilities, for sample collection and for fieldwork. You can include subsistence costs. Carbon offset costs This applies to all types of travel costs Wellcome provides. You can ask for: - essential travel costs, even if the low carbon option is more expensive (for example travelling by train instead of flying) - project-related resources or activities that provide an alternative to travel, such as video conferencing, communication and file-sharing software - costs to offset the carbon emissions generated by the essential travel. If carbon offsetting for travel is not part of your organisational sustainability strategy, you can ask us for a similar level of support for other sustainability initiatives. Your organisation must get our approval before submitting an application. We won't pay for the core infrastructure that your host organisation should provide, unless you're eligible to ask for these costs under our [overheads policy](/grant-funding/guidance/overheads-policy). Examples of these costs include: - organisation-wide video conferencing packages - high-speed broadband - HD screens. See our [carbon offset policy](/grant-funding/guidance/carbon-offset-policy-travel) for travel for information on what you and your organisation need to do. Subsistence costs If you're away for up to one month you can ask for subsistence costs. These include accommodation, meals and incidentals (for example, refreshments or newspapers). If your administering organisation has a subsistence policy, use their rates. If your administering organisation doesn't have a subsistence policy, please use the [HMRC rates](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/expenses-rates-for-employees-travelling-outside-the-uk). If you're away for more than one month and up to 12 months, we will pay reasonable rental costs only, including aparthotels. You should discuss appropriate rates with your administering and host organisations, or Wellcome, as appropriate. We expect you to choose the most economical options, booked in advance where possible. If you're from a low- or middle- income country and will be working in a high-income country for more than one month and up to 12 months, you can also ask for up to \u00a310 a day to cover extra costs, such as transport and incidentals. If you're away for more than 12 months, we will pay the costs of your housing. You should discuss your needs with your administering and host organisations. The allowance we provide will be based on family and business need. We will set the maximum allowance we pay for each location. This will be based on current market data or, where data is unavailable, in consultation with your administering organisation, using equivalent market rates. Please [contact us](/who-we-are/contact-us/funding-enquiry) if you need help calculating the costs. We will cover the direct expenses you have to pay to find and rent a home. We will not cover the cost of utilities or any refurbishment. Overseas research If you or any research staff employed on your grant will be doing research away from your home laboratory, we'll help with the additional costs of working on the project overseas. Please see the 'Overseas allowances' section for details. If you or any staff employed on your grant will be spending time in another country, we'll help you with the additional costs of working on the project overseas. Our overseas allowances are: - a contribution towards the personal cost of carrying out research overseas, to ensure that you are not disadvantaged - provided on the assumption that you'll be paying income tax, either in your home country, or the country you will be working in (your personal tax is your responsibility). - provided on the understanding that you or your partner will not receive equivalent allowances from elsewhere - determined by the amount of time you will spend away from your home country. Carbon offset costs We expect the people we fund to choose travel that has a lower carbon impact, where practical, even if it's more expensive (for example travelling by train instead of flying). You can ask for costs to offset the carbon generated by the travel, as part of your overseas allowances. If carbon offsetting for travel is not part of your organisational sustainability strategy, you can ask us for a similar level of support for other sustainability initiatives. Your organisation must get our approval for other sustainability initiatives to be included in applications. See our [carbon offset policy](/grant-funding/guidance/carbon-offset-policy-travel) for travel for information on what you and your organisation need to do. If you will be away more than 12 months, we will provide overseas allowances for your partner and any dependants if they are travelling with you. If you will be away for 12 months or less and can justify why your partner and dependants must travel with you, we may provide overseas allowances for them. We define your partner as the person: - you're married to - you're not married to but with whom you've been in a relationship for at least a year and - you live with at the same permanent address and share some form of joint financial commitment with, such as a mortgage. See a list of [low- and middle-income countries](/grant-funding/guidance/low-and-middle-income-countries), as defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). You can ask for the following allowances. You need to provide estimated costs as accurately as possible. We will pay your travel costs at the beginning and end of your overseas work. Costs can be for air, ferry, train or coach fares. All fares should be: - in line with our [carbon offset policy](/node/7687) - booked in advance where possible. If you are away for up to 12 months, you can ask for up to 80kg of additional baggage or unaccompanied airline freight for your outward and return journeys.

You cannot ask for these charges in your grant application. If you need to carry out clinical research using NHS patients or facilities, we will cover some of the research costs. Annex A of the [guidelines for attributing the costs of health and social care research and development (AcoRD)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-attributing-the-costs-of-health-and-social-care-research) sets out the costs we cover, and which costs should be funded through the Department of Health and Social Care in England, or its equivalent in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
