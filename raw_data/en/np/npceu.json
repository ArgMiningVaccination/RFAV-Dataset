The Lancet's retraction came le ss than a week after the United Kingdom's General Medical Council, the regulator of medical practice, ruled that British doctor Andrew Wakefield, the autho r of the study, had acted \"dishonestly an d irresponsibly\" by failing to disclose financial conflicts of interest. It also was stated that he had shown \"callous disregard\" to the patients in the study by subjecting them to u nnecessary invasive procedures. Wakefield's study, published in 1998, has done irreparable damage by causing skepticism of the safety of vaccines. This has resulted in lower vaccination rates, both i n Europe and the United States, and an increase in infectious diseases that previously had become rare. The Lancet's brief retraction article states: \"several elements of the 19 98 paper by Wakefield et al are incorrect.\" Ten of the 13 authors of the original paper had partially ret racted the paper in 2004, but W akefield did not. He continues to push the view that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine causes autism. Following the findings of the medi cal council and the retraction by The Lancet, Wakefield issued a statement saying: \"The allegations against me and against my colleagues a re both unfounded and unjust and I invite anyone to examine the contents of these proceedings and come to their own conclusion.\" While the retraction supports the scientific evidence that vaccinations do not cause autism, it is not likely to persuade the advocacy groups that believe in the link. It is very important to continue to educat e parents about the safety of vaccines. Immunization Newsletter .

The North Dakota Immunization Program will be hosting its first statewide immunization conference Aug. 2425, 2010, at the Seven Seas in Mandan, N.D. We are excited to The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Sanofi Pasteur's Fluzone\u00ae HighDose influenza vaccine. The new vaccine for adults 65 and older will be available to healthcare providers this fall in preparation for the 20102011 influenza season. Fluzone\u00ae HighDose vaccine was designed specifically to generate a more robust immune response in people 65 and older. Typically, this age group does not respond as well to the standard dose of influenza virus vaccines as younger individuals because of their weakened immune systems. Compared to younger adults, people 65 and older suffer disproportionately from seasonal influenza and its complications, including severe illness and death. Fluzone\u00ae HighDose vaccine contains 60 mcg of hemagglutinin per strain of influenza virus, compared to 15 mcg of hemagglutinin per strain of influenza virus in the standarddose influenza vaccine. The new Fluzone\u00ae HighDose vaccine is produced in the same production facility as Fluzone\u00ae vaccine and is supplied as a singledose, preservativefree, prefilled syringe. In the clinical trial, Fluzone\u00ae HighDose was shown to have a clinically comparable safety profile to Fluzone\u00ae vaccine. expected to be available for order beginning in late February. Merck has communicated that ProQuad\u00ae will be available sometime in 2010, but the timing of the availability is Due to new and unanticipated circumstances, Merck is delaying the relaunch of ProQuad\u00ae. ProQuad\u00ae \u2014 the measles, mumps, rubella, varicella combination vaccine \u2014 previously had been currently unknown. The purpose of the delay is to prioritize the supply of Varivax\u00ae and Zostavax\u00ae. Supplies of MMRII\u00ae and Varivax\u00ae are currently sufficient to meet demand.

Bring them to the conference! Immunization Newsletter . Page 2 Division of Disease Control AFIX (Assessment, F eedback, I ncentive, and eX change) is a continuous quality improvement tool that consists of (1) assessment of the healthcare provider's vaccination coverage levels and immunization practices; (2) feedback of the results to the provider, along with recommended strategies to improve coverage l evels; (3) motivating the provi der through incentives to improve vaccination coverage levels; and (4) exchanging healthcare information and resources necessary to facilitate improvement. The North Dakota Departme nt of Health began conducting AFIX visits in 2000. Each year, the NDDoH visits about 100 chil dhood immunization providers in North Dakota. This year, because of a shortage of Hibcontainin g vaccines, rates were assessed excluding Hib vaccine. The following providers have been recognized as \"Immunization L eaders\" by achieving immunization rates of 85 percent and higher by 24 months of age for the : Hettinger Clinic \u2014 Hettinger Center for Family Medicine \u2014 Bismarck Southeast Medical Center \u2014 Oakes Altru Clinic Pediatrics \u2014 Grand Forks Meritcare Broadway Children's Southwest \u2014 Fargo Q&R Family Practice \u2014 Bismarck Public Provider : Cavalier County Health Department \u2014 Langdon The following providers are recei ving the \"Most Improved Immuni zation Rates\" award.

The above providers were assessed in 2009. 2009 AFIX Awards Page 3 Traveling to another country can be an experience of a lifetime. To keep healthy in a foreign location, it is important for travelers to be vaccinated against preventable diseases. All travelers, regardless of age or destination, should be uptodate on the routinely recommended immunizati ons. These include: Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. Measles, mumps and rubella. Hepatitis B. Polio. Haemophilus influenzae type B. Pneumococcal disease. Hepatitis A. Varicella. Influenza. Meningococcal disease. Depending on the destina tion and purpose for travel, some travelers may need additional vaccines for diseases that are not vaccinated The North Dakota Immunization Program has a new children's activity book availab le at no cost to providers! Th e activity book, which features Ollie the Owl and his friends, is a fun way for kids to lea rn about vaccines. The book was designed by Tracy K. Miller, MPH, of the Division of Disease Control. To preview the book and print an updated order form, visit our website at www.ndhealth.gov/Immunize . Passport? Luggage? Tickets? Immunization Newsletter . Page 4 against routinely in the United States. These include: Yellow fever. Typhoid. Rabies. Japanese encephalitis. Yellow fever vaccination currently is required by International Health Regulations (IHR) for travel to 20 countries in subSaharan Africa and tropical South America. Meningococcal vaccination is required by the government of Saudi Arabia for annual travel during the Hajj. There are seven certified yellow fever vaccination clinics in North Dakota. The people of North Dakota would benefit from more!

NEW Immunization Activity Books The CDC has published the 2010 childhood, adolescent and adult immunization schedules. There are some important changes to note: Combination Vaccines The statement in the introductory paragraph has been changed to express the preference of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the use of combination vaccines. Polio The last dose in the IPV series is to be given after the age of 4 and at least six months after the previous dose. If four doses are given before the age of 4, an additional (fifth) dose should be given between the ages of 4 and 6. Hepatitis A The footnote was revised to allow the vaccination of children older than 23 months for whom hepatitis A immunity is desired. Meningococcal Conjugate Revaccination with meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) is recommended for children who remain at increased risk Confusion exists regarding whether or not college freshmen should be revaccinated with meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4, Menactra\u00ae). College freshmen should only be with MCV\u00ad4 if: They were vaccinated with MPSV4 (Menomune\u00ae) five or more years previously, OR They are at increased risk of meningococcal disease because of one of the three criteria (see box at right). 2010 Immunization Schedules Now Available College Freshmen & Menactra\u00ae: Revaccinate? for meningococcal disease after three years (if the first dose was administered between 2 and 6 years of age) or after five years (if the first dose was administered at age 7 or older). Human Papillomavirus Footnotes have been modified to include the availability of and recommendations for the bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. A permissive recommendation for vaccination with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine for males ages 9 through 18 was also added. Immunization Newsletter . Page 5 People considered to be at increased risk of meningococcal disease include those with: Functional anatomic asplenia. Persistent complement component deficiency. Prolonged exposure (microbiologists and travelers). Pneumovax\u00ae & Zostavax\u00ae \u2014 Simultaneous Administration Communication recently has been distributed by Merck Corporatio n indicating a decreased effectiveness of pneumococcal po lysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax \u00ae) when administered simultaneously with zoster vaccine (Zostavax \u00ae). The CDC has not changed its recommendation. Pneumovax and Zostavax may be administered simultaneously. Generally, the CDC recommends simultaneous administration of vaccines to increase the likelihood of being upto date on immunizations. WasteGuidance.pdf ). For information about vaccines that contain thimerosal, visit www.vaccinesafety.edu/thitable.htm . Hazardous waste should be kept separate and should be disposed of prop erly. A list of hazardous waste disposal companies can be found at www.ndhealth.gov/WM/Publications/ HazardousWasteManagementCompanies.pdf . Most health systems already have policies and procedures for handling hazardous waste. You can assume that preservativefree vaccines (most commonly singleuse vials) and singledose prefilled syringes are not hazardous. Infectious waste: You can assume that an emp ty vial that contained vaccine is not infectious. However, that vial is considered infectious waste if combined with a used sharp, such as an inj ection syringe, broken contaminated glass or lancet. Proper disposal of expired and wasted vaccines is everyone's responsibility to protect our environment. To dispose of vaccines appropriately, you need to know if they are either hazardous waste or infectious waste, both, or neither. Those that are neither are considered industrial solid waste (normal trash). Hazardous Waste: Unused or expired vaccines are considered hazardous if they contain mercury (such as thimerosal) or cresol based preservatives. These most commonly are found in multidose vials and some prefilled syringes. Any vial that is not empty and contains vaccine with a mercury or cresolbased preservative must be managed as hazardous waste per North Dakota's Pharmaceutical Waste Guidance ( www.ndhealth.gov/wm/ Publications/NorthDakotaPharmaceutical Hazardous Waste Disposal Guidelines Page 6 Immunization Newsletter . In-School Influenza Vaccination Pilot Project For the 20102011 influenza season, 19 public health units in N orth Dakota will be participating in the school influenza vaccination pro ject. In an attempt to ease the burden for all providers during the notoriously difficult influenza se ason, the participating healt h units are taking on the task of offering influenza vaccine to children in schools. The vaccine will be p rovided to insured and VFCeligible children. To find out if your county is participating or to offer assista nce to this beneficial program, contact your local public health unit. H1N1 Vaccine Available The NDDoH still has H1N1 influenz a vaccine available. To place an order, download the H1N1 Vaccine Order Form from the following website: www.ndflu.com//V accine/VaccineInformation.aspx . If your practice has expired vaccine, remember to dispose of it according to the g uidelines below. Immunization Newsletter . Page 7 New ACIP Recommendations At the February meeting of the ACIP, the committee voted to expand the recommendations for influenza vaccination to include healthy adults. As a result, everyone older than 6 months is recommended to receive seasonal influenza vaccine. H1N1 will be included in the trivalent seasonal vaccine for the 20102011 influenza season. The ACIP also made recommendations for the use of Prevnar 13\u00ae (PCV13), the new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine replacing Prevnar\u00ae (PCV7). Recommendations for infants and children 2 through 59 months who previously have not received any doses of PCV7 or PCV13 are the same as the previous recommendations for PCV7, with PCV13 replac ing PCV7 for all doses . Children who are vaccinated incompletely with PCV7 or PCV13 should co mplete the series with PCV13. A single dose of PC V13 is recommended for all healthy children 24 through 59 months with any incomplete schedule. For children 24 through 71 months wit h underlying medical conditions who have re ceived any incomplete schedule of less than three doses of PCV7 or PCV13, two doses of PC V13 are recommended. Children with underlying medical conditions who have received three doses of PCV7 or PCV13 are recommended to receive a single dose of PCV13 through 71 months. Many children have already completed the PCV7 series. A single dose of PCV 13 is recommended for all children 14 through 59 months who have received an ageappropriate, complete PCV7 schedule. For children with underlying medical conditions, a single PCV 13 dose is recommended through 71 months. A single dose of PCV13 may be administered to children 6 through 18 year s who are at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal disease because of sickle cell disease, HIV infection or other immunocompromising condition, cochlear implant or cerebrospinal fluid leaks, regardless of whether they previo usly received PCV7 or pneumococcal polysacchar ide at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ recs/provisional .
