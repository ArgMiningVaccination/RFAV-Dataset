Animal Health Component 100% Research Effort Categories Basic 50% Applied 50% Developmental (N/A) Goals / Objectives The over-arching goal of this Phase I SBIR project is to construct a non-neuroinvasive BoHV-1 R2 vaccine. The objectives are:1: Establish a self-excising bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) infectious clone from a BoHV-1 isolate. This new clone be used to produce a vaccine free of intellectual property constraints.2: Introduce R2 mutations into the BAC and delete the US9 gene to make a marker vaccine derivative. Our established recombination methods will be used to modify the BoHV-1 BAC clone first to mutate the UL37 gene in the R2 effector coding region, and second to delete the US9 gene. Propagation of the recovered viruses will be assessed in cell culture.3: Validate the safety and efficacy of the BoHV-1 live-attenuated vaccine in calves. A Go/No-Go decision to advance the BoHV-1 vaccine will be based on confirmation that the R2 mutations ablate the neuroinvasive property of the virus and its virulence, while also providing unprecedented protection against native BoHV-1 challenge. Project Methods In our proof-of-concept project, we will first generate a BoHV-1 vaccine that includes the R2 mutation. This is performed using state-of-the-art molecular virology methods. Once generated in the lab, the BoHV-1 R2 vaccine will be examined in vitro using live-cell imaging to establish that it demonstrates the expected phenotype, i.e., no net movement of viral capsids in neuronal axons. Next, the BoHV-1 R2 vaccine is examined in calves. After intranasal application, neural tissues are collected are processed for histological examination of viral infected sensory neurons. Lastly, we will compare BoHV-1 R2 vaccination to mock vaccination in calves to afford protection against wild-type BoHV-1 challenge. The effectiveness will be evaluated by the health of the animals and by examining "}
