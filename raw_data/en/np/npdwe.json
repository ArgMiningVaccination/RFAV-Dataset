These products are often marketed as natural alternatives to approved prescription and nonprescription products and are widely available in the marketplace. Homeopathic products, however, are marketed without FDA review and may not meet modern standards for safety, effectiveness, quality and labeling. FDA uses a risk-based approach to monitor these products and to evaluate reports of adverse effects. Homeopathy is an alternative medical practice developed in the late 1700s that is based on the principle that a substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person can be used in diluted form to treat symptoms and illnesses, also known as \"like cures like.\" Homeopathic drug products are made from a wide range of substances, including ingredients derived from plants, healthy or diseased animal or human sources, minerals and chemicals, including known poisons. These products have the potential to cause significant and even permanent harm if they are poorly manufactured, since that could lead to contaminated products or products that have potentially toxic ingredients at higher levels than are labeled and/or safe, or if they are marketed as substitute treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions, or to vulnerable populations. In addition, some products may be labeled as homeopathic that do not conform to traditional homeopathic principles. As the homeopathy industry continues to grow at a rapid pace, we want to clarify for both consumers and industry how we assess the potential safety risks of these products. That's why in 2017, the FDA issued a draft guidance discussing our, risk-based enforcement approach to drug products labeled as homeopathic. Today, we are taking two new steps toward clarifying this approach. First, we have [revised the 2017 draft guidance](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-23335.pdf) to provide further information around our approach and are asking for public input on the revised draft. The draft guidance details a risk-based enforcement policy prioritizing certain categories of homeopathic products that could pose a higher risk to public health, including products with particular ingredients and routes of administration, products for vulnerable populations, and products with significant quality issues. We encourage the public to review this revised draft guidance and comment before it is finalized. We will consider feedback gathered through this new public comment period, the more than 4,500 comments interested stakeholders submitted on the original 2017 draft guidance, and information gleaned from a 2015 public hearing on the current use of homeopathic drug products. When finalized, this guidance will help provide transparency regarding the categories of homeopathic drug products that we intend to prioritize under our risk-based enforcement approach. Second, the agency is [withdrawing](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-23334.pdf) the Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 400.400, entitled \"Conditions Under Which Homeopathic Drugs May be Marketed.\" Risk is an important driver of the FDA's regulatory and enforcement actions for all drug products, including homeopathic drug products. Since the issuance of CPG 400.400 in 1988, the FDA has encountered multiple situations in which homeopathic drug products posed a significant risk to patients, even though the products, as labeled, appeared to meet the conditions described in CPG 400.400. However, CPG 400.400 is inconsistent with our risk-based approach to regulatory and enforcement action generally and therefore does not reflect our current thinking. Therefore, it is appropriate to withdraw CPG 400.400 at this time. Today's efforts are a continuation of the FDA's long-standing work to protect Americans from potentially harmful products that are labeled as homeopathic. For example, the FDA has issued warning letters to companies who produce homeopathic drug products for significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations and various other violations. So far in 2019, we've issued more than 10 warning letters to companies for violations concerning homeopathic products. Recently, we issued warning letters to [Kadesh Inc.](/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/kadesh-international-570947-05022019), [U.S. Continental Marketing, Inc.](/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/us-continental-marketing-inc-570748-05022019), [Fill It Pack It Inc](/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/fill-it-pack-it-inc-570946-05022019). and [Bershtel Enterprises LLC dba WePackItAll](/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/bershtel-enterprises-llc-dba-wepackitall-570885-05022019), which had jointly manufactured and packaged eye drops produced in non-sterile conditions which could result in serious eye infections. These warning letters should alert all companies that homeopathic drug products must be manufactured and labeled in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and agency regulations. The FDA is committed to a risk-based approach to homeopathic drug products, and we'll continue taking appropriate regulatory and enforcement actions when we believe patients are being put at risk. In the meantime, we continue to encourage healthcare professionals and consumers to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of any homeopathic drug products to the [FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program](/safety/medwatch-fda-safety-information-and-adverse-event-reporting-program). The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. ### Inquiries - Media: - "}
