Oh to get a good night's sleep! I don't think I've actually had one since I gave birth to my first child. First it's the sleepless nights with baby, then the sicknesses and bad dreams of childhood. And when you think you've finally graduated from all that, you hit the stay-out-late teenage years (and who can sleep when your kid's not home yet)?!! And then you hit perimenopause and menopause - and the hot flashes start and the sleep disruption continues.... Natural Ingredients to Look For in Sleep Aids After SO many years of not-great sleep, I found myself in desperate need of a sleep aid of some sort. But not just any old sleep aid from the drug store - I wanted to use a sleep supplement made with clean and natural ingredients, and without any artificial fillers. And I was looking for something other than melatonin. [Melatonin is great for managing your sleep](https://mindfulmomma.com/natrol-melatonin-for-managing-sleep/) during times of transition, like daylight saving time or overseas travel, but it's not meant to be used as a sleep aid on an ongoing basis. After doing some research on natural sleep remedies, I've discovered the best sleep inducing ingredients to look for in a sleep supplement: Gaba (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid) is a widely studied neurotransmitter that helps put your brain into sleep mode for the night. Low GABA activity is linked to insomnia and disrupted sleep. ( [source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sleep-newzzz/201901/3-amazing-benefits-gaba)) Magnesium glycinate (or bisglycinate) is a highly absorbable form of magnesium that promotes a deep and restorative sleep. One of the many benefits of magnesium is that it helps regulate Gaba, which helps power you down and get ready for sleep. ( [source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12163983/)) Magnesium can also help improve restless leg syndrome, another disorder that can keep people up at night. ( [source](https://www.healthline.com/health/restless-leg-syndrome/link-between-magnesium-and-rls)) Jujube is a fruit used in Traditional Chinese medicine. It helps to calm the mind and quiet neural activity, which helps to induce sleep. ( [source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sleep-newzzz/201809/how-jujube-can-improve-your-sleep-and-health#:~:text=For%20sleep.&text=One%20of%20the%20strongest%20benefits,shown%20to%20increase%20sleep%20time.)). Clinical studies have found that the consumption of the jujube seed had a positive impact on the sleep quality of postmenopausal women. ( [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7735973/)) L-theanine is an amino acid that is clinically proven to reduce the amount of time it takes to fall asleep, and to reduce insomnia. ( [source](https://www.healthline.com/health/l-theanine#:~:text=Some%20research%20indicates%20that%20L,to%20promote%20relaxation%20(16).)) Reishi mushroom is an adaptogenic mushroom used in Traditional Chinese medicine that has been shown to support longer sleep time. ( [source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92913-6)) Passionflower is an herb that is clinically proven to calm the mind and promote longer, quality sleep. ( [source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21294203/)) Passionflower appears to boost the level of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. ( [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5699852/)) 5-HTP is a botanically derived compound of an amino acid that promotes a calm and relaxed mood by increasing serotonin, which can be converted into the hormone melatonin. A study has shown that a combination of 5-HTP and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reduced the time it took to fall asleep, increased sleep duration and improved sleep quality. ( [source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19417589/)) CBD is a phytocannabinoid derived from the hemp plant. Phytocannabinoids work naturally within the body to help regulate processes like appetite, mood and sleep. Studies have shown a connection between CBD and improved sleep.

[Full disclosure.](https://mindfulmomma.com/privacy-policy/) I've been fortunate to have been sent samples of three different sleep supplements to test out for myself. I used each of them for at least a full month. The first sleep supplement I tried was the mindbodygreen Sleep Support+ and I definitely noticed a difference in the quality of my sleep after using it for one month straight! However, when it came to changing from one of these three natural sleep aids to the other, to be completely honest, I didn't notice a big difference. My guess is that they all do a pretty good job of helping to induce sleep, based on the high quality, natural ingredients used in the formulas. One caveat - these sleep formulas do NOT make hot flashes disappear. Nor will they keep your baby from waking up in the middle of the night. But we take what we can get, right? And any bit of sleep support helps! mindbodygreen Sleep Support+ mindbodygreen makes all natural supplements with targeted nutrients and bioactives, in carefully calculated doses, that work synergistically to radically transform your health. Sleep Support+ is a science-backed formula that helps you fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, and wake up feeling rejuvenated. - Key daily 1-2 bedtime. - Cost: $49 subscription price, $60 one-time price for 60 capsules - My take: This was the first natural sleep supplement that I tried and I've kept in on auto-ship ever since!
