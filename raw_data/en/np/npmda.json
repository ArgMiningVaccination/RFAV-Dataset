Herein, we provide a pioneering report about the employment of VitC amphiphile self-assembled nanofiber hydrogels for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. Specifically, driven by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic in- teractions, the synthesized VitC amphiphile, consisting of a VitC headgroup and self-healing properties. The formed VitC hydrogel not only serves as a reservoir for VitC but also acts as an effective delivery platform for stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist-4 (SA). Interestingly, the VitC hydrogel itself exhibits antitumor effects by upregulating genes related to interferon (IFN) signaling, apoptotic signaling and viral recognition and defense. Moreover, the SA-encapsulated VitC hydrogel (SA@VitC hydrogel) synergistically activated the immune system to inhibit the progression of both local and abscopal tumors. Vitamin C (VitC), a natural bioactive compound with high biosafety and low cost, is emerging as an appealing anticancer candidate [1-3]. Many previous literatures have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of VitC with high dosage after intravenous injection for various cancer treatment [4-6]. Additionally, VitC has also been used in combination with many other therapeutic agents such as DNA methyltransferase in- hibitors, chemotherapeutic drugs, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, achieving synergistic therapeutic effects [7-9]. It has been reported that VitC can kill cancer cells by producing hydrogen peroxide via proox - idant effects and disrupting Fe2\u0087metabolism [5,9]. Moreover, VitC usually maintains at high levels in most immune cells and regulates many aspects of immune responses [10,11]. Intracellular VitC can also act as an enzyme cofactor for DNA and histone demethylation reactions to regulate cell phenotype, growth and survival pathways [12-15]. For instance, VitC shown to upregulate endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in lymphoma cells, which can trigger interferon responses by activating the viral defense pathway to activate the immune system to recognize tumor cells [12]. Furthermore, it has also been reported that VitC can promote both the innate and adaptive immune responses by epigenetically modulating T cells [13,14]. However, these unique functions of VitC, such as activating immune cells, only work at very high local concentrations [15,16]. Considering the hydrophilic charac - teristic of VitC, it usually exhibits quick excretion in vivo and leads to limited efficiency in activating immune cells [17,18]. To achieve ideal therapeutic efficiency, VitC at a high dosage is administered intrave - nously with high frequency, which may cause inconvenience to patients with repeated injection [19]. Moreover, the systemic adverse effects of long-term and repeated injections of VitC are still unclear [20]. Thus, it is of great significance to develop an advanced VitC delivery system to achieve high local concentrations in the long term to effectively promote cancer immunotherapy. Hydrogels are highly appealing drug delivery systems with high local concentrations, sustained release profiles, long-term retention, and minimal adverse effects [21-24]. For supramolecular hydrogels self-assembled by weak and dynamic noncovalent interactions, their structure and physicochemical properties could be easily and flexibly modulated, permitting effective and safe treatment [25,26]. Typically, timyangsh@tongji.edu.cn (Y. Received in revised form 30 June 2022; Accepted 6 July 2022 Biomaterials 287 (2022) 121673 2usually exhibits quick gel-sol phase transition and self-healing proper - ties, allowing direct injection into the target sites with minimal inva- siveness [27-29]. Moreover, such supramolecular hydrogels could effectively encapsulate bioactive substances with different properties (e. g., size and charge) and efficiently deliver them [30-32]. Recently, designing \"self-delivery \" supramolecular therapeutic hydrogels, which are able to achieve excellent therapeutic effects and deliver other ther- apeutics, has attracted wide attention [33,34]. Compared to traditional Scheme 1.Schematic illustration of VitC-based nanofiber hydrogels for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. A) The preparation of drug-loaded VitC hydrogel and the release of drugs from the hydrogel. B) Immune responses induced by VitC-based nanofiber hydrogels. hydrogels, self-delivery hydrogels exhibit many other unique advantages, including minimized excipient contents, high drug loading capacity, and synergistic functions with cargo [35-37]. Herein, we provide the first report on the use of a VitC \"self-delivery \" supramolecular hydrogel to regulate the immune microenvironment, delivery of immunologic stimulants, and achieve syn- ergistic immunotherapeutic effects (Scheme 1). we synthesized the amphiphile by modifying hydrophilic VitC with a hydrophobic alkyl chain via an ester bond, which is liable for enzymatic digestion in vivo. by self-healing the applied hydrogel, acting as VitC depots, could sustainably release VitC to inhibit tumor growth by upregulating genes related to interferon (IFN) signaling, apoptotic signaling and viral recognition and defense. Interferon genes (STING) agonist (SA) effec- tively activated the STING signaling pathway to vigorously stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses, achieving potent therapeutic results in pre-clinical studies [38-40]. Delivery of SA by VitC hydrogel may achieve synergistic anticancer effects by promoting dendritic cell (DC) maturation and improving the tumor infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. Thus, the SA-encapsulated VitC hydrogel (SA@VitC hydrogel) exhibited synergistic antitumor immune responses that significantly impaired the growth of both local and abscopal tumors. 1.Results and discussion Synthesis and characterization of VitC hydrogel. The gelator, an amphiphile based on VitC, was synthesized as shown in Fig. 1A and Scheme S1 by modifying a dodecyl carbon chain to the hydroxyl at position 6 of VitC. Specifically, we synthesized dibenzyl VitC derivative 3 according to reported procedures [41,42]. Then, dodecyl isocyanate was modified to dibenzyl VitC derivative 3 with carbamate bonds. Finally, the targeted VitC amphiphile was obtained by removing the dibenzyl protection via a hydrogen reduction reaction.

Zhang Biomaterials 287 of VitC by VitC amphiphiles phosphate-buffered sa- line (PBS) with annealing treatment. The self-assembly behavior of hydrogel revealed an obvious concentration-dependent process, and the minimum gelation concentration (MGC) of VitC amphiphile was found to be 15 mM (Fig. S2). The morphology of the obtained hydrogel was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. A supramolecular nanofiber with entangled network was observed in Fig. 1C, indicating the successful self-assembly of VitC amphiphile. As shown in the enlarged TEM image, the compact filamentous nano- structures were clearly observed. Then, the mechanical properties of the hydrogel were evaluated by rheological analysis. In the detected con- centration range in Fig. 1D and S3, the storage modulus (G) of hydrogels was much higher than the loss modulus (G), and both moduli were interdependent in the dynamic frequency sweep range, demonstrating the viscoelastic soft characteristic of the hydrogel. Moreover, as the concentration of hydrogel increased, both Gand Gincreased signifi - cantly, indicating that more molecules participated in the self-assembly process to improve the mechanical properties of the hydrogel (Fig. S3a). Moreover, as shown in Fig. S3b, no temperature-induced phase transi - tion was observed as Gremained higher than Gduring the temperature sweep from 4 C to 37 C. Meanwhile, Gand Gincreased initially and then remained stable until 20 C, indicating that multiple noncovalent interactions including hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions reached a balanced state after 20 C. Moreover, the VitC supramolecular hydrogel could quickly recover to its original shape and structure after being injected from needles with different gauge sizes due to its unique shear-thinning and self-healing properties (Fig. 1D and Fig. S4). Subsequently, the self-assembly mechanism was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Fig. 1E). The peaks of Fig. 2.Drug-release behavior of SA encapsulated VitC hydrogel.

Statistical significance was calculated via one-way ANOVA with a headgroups interacted with each other by hydrogen- bonding interactions (Fig. 1F), which was consistent with the FTIR results. Drug-release behavior of SA@VitC hydrogel. Then, the STING agonist SA (the molecular structure is provided in Fig. S5), which has been proposed to enhance tumor immunogenicity was encapsulated to form the SA@VitC hydrogel. It was found that the encapsulation of SA exhibited negligible effects on the formation and structure of the VitC hydrogel (Fig. S6). Then, the release behaviors of SA and VitC from the SA@VitC hydrogel were assessed in PBS containing esterase (50.0 units/ mL) at 37 C. As observed in Fig. 2A, SA and VitC were quickly released in the presence of esterase in the initial 7 days with cumulative release over 60%, and the release rate was gradually reduced in the subsequent time period. Additionally, the cumulative release behaviors of VitC amphiphile and VitC from VitC hydrogel in the absence of esterase were also studied (Fig. S7). As expected, nearly no VitC was detected and VitC amphiphile showed similar release mode with that of VitC in the pres- ence of esterase, indicating that VitC would disassemble in the dialysate, and then VitC amphiphile could be more accessible to esterase, leading to sustainable release of both VitC and encapsulated SA [43-45]. Next, a fluorescence dye, indocyanine green (ICG), was encapsulated in the amphiphilic matrix to form the ICG@VitC hydrogel for more intuitive observation. As shown in the confocal images of the frozen sections of ICG@VitC hydrogel, the fluorescence signal from ICG exhibited uniform distribution in the gel, indicating the successful encapsulation of cargos in the hydrogel matrix (Fig. 2B). Then, the release of encapsulated agent in VitC hydrogel in PBS with or without esterase was further studied. The fluorescence signal of ICG from the VitC hydrogel dispersed in PBS containing esterase lost much more quickly than that dispersed in PBS, further confirming that esterase could promote the degradation of VitC hydrogel and lead to the quick release of encapsulated cargos (Fig. 2C and D). We then investigated the degradation behavior of VitC hydrogel in vivo. VitC hydrogel (1% (w/v), subcutaneously injected into the backs of Balb/c mice, and then the mice were sacrificed, and the remaining hydrogel was photographed and weighed at the indicated time points (Fig. 2E and F). The nearly linear weight loss profile of VitC hydrogel confirmed its degradation behavior in vivo (Fig. 2F). To investigate the sustained release of encapsulated drugs from this VitC hydrogel, ICG-loaded VitC hydrogel and free ICG solution were injected into the tumors of mice and imaged by an in vivo fluorescence imaging system. As shown in Fig. 2G and H, the fluorescence signal of ICG in the tumor injected with ICG@VitC hydrogel was obviously detected even 7 days after injection, while the signal of ICG in the tumor injected with free ICG rapidly disappeared one day later. Quantitative statistical analysis further demonstrated the sustained release of ICG in tumors with ICG@VitC hydrogel injection. Therefore, the VitC hydrogel could be employed as a reservoir for targeted and long-term drug delivery. Immunotherapy and immune responses induced by SA@VitC hydrogel. Encouraged by the slow degradation and sustained release of encapsulated agents from VitC hydrogel, we then evaluated the anti- tumor effects of SA@VitC hydrogel on the subcutaneous CT26 colon tumor model (Fig. 3A). After CT26 tumors implanted, mice were grouped and intratumorally injected with PBS (20 L), free SA (15 g per mouse, 20 L), VitC hydrogel (2.5% (w/v), 20 L) or per mouse, 2.5% (w/v) VitC hydrogel, 20 L). Compared to the PBS group, the VitC hydrogel itself delayed tumor growth and extended the life span to 20-26 days, indicating that VitC at a high local concentration indeed exerted antitumor effects (Fig. 3B, C and Fig. S8). Moreover, the mice treated with SA@VitC hydrogel showed the smallest tumor volume (Fig. 3B) and significantly prolonged survival to 100% within four weeks (Fig. 3C) due to the encapsulation of STING agonist SA, which could promote the immune-stimulating tumor microenvi - ronment and augment antitumor immune responses [46-48]. These results suggested that the SA@VitC hydrogel was able to sustainably release SA and VitC during degradation, and that the released VitC may regulate the immune microenvironment to promote the immune re- sponses induced by SA. Meanwhile, to investigate whether the injectable hydrogel could cause mechanical damage to tumors, a control group, calcium ion coordinated alginate hydrogel (Ca@ALG hydrogel) was added. As shown in Fig. S9, compared to the PBS group, the growth rate of tumors injected with Ca@ALG remained nearly unchanged, but the growth rate of tumors injected with VitC hydrogel was obviously inhibited, indicating that the mechanical damage induced by injectable hydrogel could not delay the growth of tumors. Thus, the SA@VitC hydrogel could achieve a synergistic therapeutic effect. In addition, no appreciable decrease in body weight was observed, suggesting that such locally applied SA@VitC hydrogel induced no obvious side effects (Fig. 3D). Then, we investigated the population of different immune cells infiltrated in the tumor with different treatments. We first investigated the maturation of DCs, which are critical antigen-presenting cells con- necting the innate and adaptive immune systems [49]. Three days-after different treatments, the tumors near lymph nodes were collected to obtain single cells for flow cytometry analysis. Compared to the PBS group, both free SA and VitC hydrogel could promote DC maturation (Fig. 3E). More excitingly, the percentage of DC maturation (16.4%) of SA-loaded VitC hydrogel was higher than that treated with VitC or free SA (13.0%), demonstrating that SA-encapsulated VitC hydrogel could synergistically promote DC maturation. In the parallel experiment, six days after different treat- ments, the mice were sacrificed, and their tumors were collected to analyze different immune cells by flow cytometry. Notably, the per- centage of tumor-infiltrating natural killer in VitC hydrogel- and SA@VitC hydrogel-treated tumors, indicating that both SA and VitC hydrogel were effective in activating NK cells (Fig. 3F). In addition to NK cells, we further studied the per- centage of T cells, which usually play an important role in inhibiting tumor growth. Strikingly, the percentages of tumor-infiltrating CD4\u0087 (CD3\u0087CD4\u0087CD8\u0000) and CD8\u0087(CD3\u0087CD4\u0000CD8\u0087) T cells, especially T cells, obviously increased further demonstrating that SA-encapsulated VitC hydrogel could synergistically boost the adaptive immune system (Fig. 3G and I). In addition to the results measured by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining of tumor slides collected from mice with different treatments visually indicated that SA@VitC hydrogel obviously increased the infiltration of CD4\u0087and CD8\u0087T cells in the tumor (Fig. 3H). In addition to investigating the percentage of different immune cells within the tumor, we also studied the concentration of different cyto- kines six days after different treatments. As observed in Fig. 4A, the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF- ) and interferon- (IFN- ) in both hydrogel and SA@VitC hydrogel groups were increased (Fig. 4A). Considering that SA is a STING agonist that can trigger the production of type I IFNs [15] we then measured the pro- duction of type I IFNs through costimulatory markers IFN- we expected, the induction of IFN- and CXCL10 transcripts was obviously observed after SA@VitC hydrogel treatment, indicating the successful activation of the STING pathway (Fig. 4B). In contrast, free SA slightly induced the transcription of IFN- and CXCL10, which may be due to the quick release of free SA. Thus, the SA@VitC hydrogel exhibited obviously enhanced ability to activate the STING pathway due to the sustained release of SA delivered by VitC hydrogel. Encouraged by the above results, we further evaluated the mecha - nism of such strong immune responses induced by the VitC hydrogel itself. According to previous papers, high-dose VitC could act as a cofactor for a family of gene regulatory enzymes to effectively activate various immune cells and improve the immunogenicity of tumors.7-12 Thus, we then investigated the effect of VitC on two important immune cells, DCs and CD8\u0087T cells in vitro. To study the effect of VitC on DC H. Zhang et al. Biomaterials 7maturation, bone concentrations of VitC, and the maturation of BMDCs was measured by detecting the surface expression of costimulatory mole- cules CD80 and CD86. It was observed that VitC at concentrations higher than 1 mM significantly promoted DC maturation (Figs. S10-S11 & Fig. 4C). Then, the concentration of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF- ) secreted by BMDCs after incubation with 1 mM VitC was measured. Interestingly, the concentration of TNF- was also obviously increased in VitC-treated group (Fig. 4C), indicating that VitC at suitable concen - trations could indeed directly promote DC maturation. In addition, we also found that CD8\u0087T cells isolated from the spleen of mice after co- incubation with VitC in vitro, exhibited a higher percentage of IFN\u0087 CD8\u0087T cells (Fig. 4D and Fig. S12), suggesting that VitC may promote lymphocyte activation. In addition to immune cells, we also carried out transcriptome sequencing analysis of CT26 cancer cells after incubation with VitC. As shown in Fig. 4E, CT26 cancer cells incubated with VitC exhibited upregulated expression of many endogenous viral defense genes, which could promote the recognition of tumor cells by immune system. Moreover, we further carried out transcriptome sequencing analysis of CT26 tumors three days after injection with VitC hydrogel (2.5% (w/v), 20 L). As shown in Fig. 4F, the genes related to viral recognition and defense, IFN signaling and apoptotic signaling were markedly upregu - lated in VitC hydrogel-treated tumor cells. To investigate whether the pro-oxidative effects of VitC at high concentrations would contribute to antitumor immunotherapy, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor tissue was analyzed using a 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe. As shown in the fluorescence imaging, no detectable difference was found in the tumor slides collected from mice treated with VitC hydrogel and PBS (Fig. S13). Taken together, these results indicated that the VitC hydrogel activated the immune system by engaging in multiple immune stimulation pathways. Although more detailed data are still necessary to reveal these mechanisms, our pilot study indeed provided presumptive positive evidence for VitC-based hydrogels to promote cancer immunotherapy. Distant tumor inhibition effect. We further assessed whether such Fig. 4.Immune responses and related mechanism induced by SA@VitC hydrogel.

P value style: *p 8immune effects induced by the locally applied SA@VitC hydrogel could inhibit the growth of distant tumors. As exhibited in Fig. 5A, a bilateral CT26 tumor model was established in this experiment. A first tumor implanted on the right side of each mouse was defined as the \"primary tumor \", and a second tumor inoculated four days later on the left side was called the \"distant tumor \". This tumor model was established by many other works to evaluate the systemic immune responses [50-52]. After the indicated treatment of the primary tumors, the sizes of tumors on both sides were measured every two days. Excitingly, both VitC hydrogel and free SA not only inhibited the growth of primary tumors but also suppressed the development of distant tumors. As expected, thanks to the long-term retention and sustained release of VitC and SA from VitC hydrogel, the sizes of both primary and distant tumors in SA@VitC hydrogel-treated group were much smaller than those in other groups at all time points (Fig. 5B). The impairment of distant tumors was further identified by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. As shown in Fig. 5C, apparent apoptosis was detected in the distant tumors collected from mice treated with SA@VitC hydrogel. To reveal the abscopal tumor inhibition mechanism induced by locally applied SA@VitC hydrogel, distant tumors were collected to evaluate different immune cells by flow cytometry. Compared to PBS group, different immune cells, including NK cells and CD8\u0087T cells, in the distant tumors collected from mice in SA@VitC hydrogel-treated Fig. 5.Systemic antitumor immune responses induced by locally applied VitC hydrogel.

Moreover, the activa - tion of T cells in the distant tumors was further confirmed by the improved percentage of IFN\u0087CD8\u0087T cells in SA@VitC hydrogel group (Fig. 5F). Taken together, these results suggested that the locally applied SA@VitC hydrogel could effectively activate the systemic immune sys- tem to trigger strong protective immune responses against abscopal tumors, exhibiting great potential in killing metastatic tumors. 2.Conclusions Here, we have developed a novel nanofiber hydrogel that is self- assembled by esterase-sensitive VitC amphiphiles for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. It was found that such VitC supramolecular hydrogels with unique self-healing properties could be injected into the tumor and act as a reservoir for targeted and sustained release of VitC in the tumor. Moreover, this VitC hydrogel also acted as an effective delivery platform for other immunotherapeutics, such as STING agonist-4 (SA). Interest - ingly, the self-delivery VitC nanofiber hydrogel itself could inhibit CT26 tumor growth by upregulating genes related to IFN signaling and apoptotic signaling, together with viral recognition and defense. More importantly, the SA@VitC hydrogel with the ability to activate these antitumor and STING pathways could significantly promote DC matu - ration and improve the tumor infiltration of NK cells and T cells, leading to serious tumor regression and systemic immune surveillance. Our findings emphasized that the localized VitC nanofiber hydrogel offers great potential to sensitize tumors to immunotherapy in a highly effec- tive and safe manner, which will accelerate the clinical development of VitC-based cancer immunotherapy. 3.Experimental section Materials, cell lines, were obtained from 3A Chem. STING agonist-4 (SA) was purchased from MedChe - mExpress. Catalase solution (35,000 units per mg protein) was ob- tained from Aladdin. Ascorbic acid assay kit was purchased from BioVision. All other reagents, if not specified, were acquired from Sigma Aldrich and used without additional purification. Mouse colon cancer CT26 cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were cultured in 1640 medium (Gibco, Invitrogen) in CO2 at 37 C. Female Balb/c mice (6-8 weeks) were purchased from Nanjing Pengsheng Biological Technology Co. All animal experiments complied with the animal protection laws of China and were approved by Soo- chow University Laboratory Animal Center (No. ECSU-2019000198). Synthesis of VitC amphiphile. The synthesis route of VitC - VitC (3) were procedures reported in previous literature [41, 42]. Dibenzyl VitC derivative 3 (1 g, 2.8 mmol) and TEA (1 mL) were dissolved in DCM (30 mL) at 0 C. Then, dodecyl isocyanate (0.65 g, 3.07 mmol) was added dropwise, and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature (rt). Then, the solvent was removed, and the mixture was further purified by column chromatography (EA/hex - ane \u00881/3) on silica gel to obtain VitC derivative 4 as a yellowish oil (1.02 g, 64.1% yield). Next, VitC derivative 4 (280 mg, 0.5 mmol) was dissolved in a mixed solution of EA/MeOH (15 mL, V/V \u00881/4). Following the addition of 10% Pd/C (14 mg), the mixture was stirred at rt overnight in a hydrogen atmosphere. Next, Pd/C was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated to obtain VitC amphiphiles as white powder in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM) were heated to 60 C until a homogeneous solution appeared. The formation of VitC hydrogel by self-assembly took place during the cooling process. To fabricate the drug-loaded hydrogel, free SA or indocyanine green (ICG) solution was mixed into VitC solution before self-assembly. The hydrogel was stored at 4 C before use and returned to room temperature (25 C) before use. TEM imaging of the hydrogel was obtained using an FEI Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope. Then, the rheological test of the VitC hydrogel was carried out on an AR 2000ex (TA Instruments) system. The parallel plates used for the test were 25 mm, and the gap during the experiment was 500 m. A VERTEX-70/70v spectrometer (Bruker Optics, Germany) was used to execute FTIR characterization. The fluorescence image of the cry- osection of the ICG-loaded hydrogel was acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 710). Drug release behavior from VitC hydrogel. The release behavior of SA from the VitC hydrogel was assessed under sink conditions in PBS containing porcine liver esterase (50.0 units/mL) and NaN 3 (0.2 wt%) at 37 C. At the indicated time points, 0.5 mL dialysate was collected and replaced with the same volume of fresh medium. The quantity of released SA was determined using high-performance liquid chroma - tography (HPLC, BioLogical DuoFlowTM). To visually observe the release behavior of the drug from the VitC hydrogel, the fluorescent dye ICG was loaded in the hydrogel. Then, the hydrogel (150 L) was placed into the upper chamber of a Transwell plate (pore size \u00888 m, Corning, cat. No. 3422), and PBS with or without esterase was added to the bottom of the chamber. The fluorescence images of the upper chambers were imaged by an IVIS Spectrum Imaging System (PerkinElmer) at different time points. Regions of interest were quantified as total radiant efficiency [p/s]/[ W/cm2] (IVIS Living Image 4.2). Immunoregulation properties VitC in vitro. Bone marrow- derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from the bone marrow of naive Balb/c mice and incubated with granulocyte macrophage- colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for seven days until their blank maturation rate was approximately 20% for future use. Splenocytes were obtained from Balb/c mice to separate T cells using the MACS pan T cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) following the manufac - turer 's instructions. The isolated T cells were cultured in specific me- dium containing anti-CD3 (5 g/mL), anti-CD28 (1 g/mL) and IL-2 g/mL) for proliferation. Prior to treatment with high-dose VitC in vitro, cells were exposed to catalase to quench free radicals as previously suggested. Briefly, all the cells were pretreated with catalase (100 g/ mL) for 1 h and then cultured in medium with or without VitC for another 12 h. After the treatment, the cells were washed and resus - pended in fresh medium for assessment. Hydrogel degradation and drug release behavior in vivo. VitC hydrogel (100 L) was injected into the backs of Balb/c mice, and then the mice were euthanized at predetermined time points. The remaining hydrogel in each mouse was photographed, and the amount of remaining gelator was determined by HPLC. For in vivo fluorescence imaging, the same volume of free ICG or ICG-loaded hydrogel (20 L, equivalent ICG concentration at 0.2 mg/mL) was intratumorally injec- ted into CT26 mouse colon tumor -bearing mice (n \u00884). The signals were monitored by an IVIS Spectrum Imaging System at the indicated time points. In vivo tumor models and treatments. CT26 cells (1 \u00d7106 cells, 50 L) were subcutaneously injected into the backs of female Balb/c mice to establish the primary tumor. Mice were randomly divided into four groups (n \u00885) until the tumor size reached ~80 mm3 and then treated H. Zhang et al. Biomaterials 287 (2022) 121673 10with For inoculation of distant tumors, 1.0 \u00d7106 CT26 cells were inoculated into the left flank of each mouse four days after implanting the primary tumor. The tumor volume was calculated according to the formula: tumor volume \u0088length \u00d7width2/ 2. Mice were euthanized when their tumor volume exceeded 1000 mm3. Flow cytometry analysis. The tumor tissues resected from mice were sliced into small pieces, digested and filtered to form single-cell suspensions. The cells were counted and divided into 105 cells/tube and then stained with fluorescence-labeled antibodies, including anti- CD45 (cat. No. No. 100708), and anti-IFN- (cat. No. 505810) according to the manufacturer 's in- structions for flow cytometry analysis on a C6 plus flow cytometer. All data were analyzed by FlowJo software (Ver. 10.0.7). Cytokine detection. Serum samples were isolated from mice 6 days after different treatments. The concentrations of TNF- (eBioscience) and IFN- (eBioscience) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosor - bent assay (ELISA) kits following the manufacturer 's instructions. To detect the levels of IFN- and CXCL-10, RNA was collected and tran- scribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) with a RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master Mix (Rox) (Servicebio) by StepOne Plus (ABI) in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The following primers was normalized to GAPDH expression in the relevant untreated control. Immunofluorescence staining. Tumors harvested from the mice were cryo-embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound and sectioned into 10-m-thick slices using a cryotome at \u000025 C. Then, the tumor sections were stained with different primary antibodies: anti-CD4 (Abcam, cat. No. ab183685), anti-CD8 (Abcam, cat. No. ab22378) overnight at 4 C. After washing in PBS 5 times, the slices were stained with fluorescently labeled goat anti-rat IgG (H \u0087L; Thermo Fisher Sci- entific, cat. No. A18866) according to the vendors ' protocols. In addi- tion, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor tissue were stained with a 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe and imaged by confocal were harvested, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at a thickness of 10 m. Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed on tumor sections according to the manufacturer 's protocol. TUNEL staining was performed using a DNA fragmentation detection kit (S7101, Millipore, USA). All results were observed by optical micro - scopy (Leica, DM4000). Statistical analysis . All data are shown as the mean \u00b1standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). Student 's t-test and one-way ANOVA with a Tukey post hoc test were used for two-group and multiple comparisons, respectively. Survival benefit was assessed using a log-rank test. The threshold for statistical significance was *P D0.05; **P D0.01; ***P D 0.001.
