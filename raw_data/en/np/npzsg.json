Regional Focus More than 95 percent of the UW School of Medicine acceptances are applicants from Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho (WWAMI). Commitment to Equity Our objective is to create a community that encourages participation and connection and values each person's unique contributions, regardless of socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, language, nationality, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, spiritual practice, geography, mental and physical status and age. Contemporary Training Our curriculum features a more active, \"flipped\" classroom approach. Clinical skills are taught in classroom, outpatient and hospital settings beginning with immersion prior to the start of classes. M.D. Program The UW School of Medicine (UWSOM) is proud of the depth and breadth of our five-state school. From Foundations of Clinical Medicine through clinical education opportunities that exist throughout the WWAMI region, we are committed to excellence in medical education\u2014it is fundamental to who we are. Successfully completing the MD program allows graduates to enter residency training, the next phase of physician training required for licensure. In Admissions, our goal is to select a regionally representative and inclusive student body that will one day care for an increasingly diverse public. We encourage students from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine to apply. UWSOM does not prefer one undergraduate university or one undergraduate degree over another as long as the student has satisfied the [pre-medical course requirements](/school-of-medicine/admissions/course-requirements) and has maintained a rigorous and varied course load. Of greater importance is what the applicant gained from the undergraduate experience (including extracurricular activities) and the variety and level of course work pursued. We strongly recommend that you apply to more than one medical school. Each school will have different application procedures, course requirements and selection factors. As an applicant, it is important that you research each school that you are interested in. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) [Medical School Admission Requirements](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/applying-medical-school-process/medical-school-admission-requirements/) has the most authoritative guide to U.S. and Canadian medical school requirements. To be considered for the University of Washington M.D. program, applicants must have United States citizenship or permanent residency (green card). International and Canadian applicants without a green card will not be considered. Permanent residence documentation is part of the application requirement. Applicants with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) who reside in a WWAMI state and who are legally authorized and recognized by their state's residency office as a resident for WWAMI educational purposes will be considered for admission. Applicants must meet the [essential requirements](/school-of-medicine/admissions/essential-requirements-of-medical-education) and technical standards and complete the [pre-medical course requirements](/school-of-medicine/admissions/course-requirements). Applications from persons who have failed to meet minimum standards at this or another medical (M.D. or D.O.) or dental school will not be considered. Non-WWAMI Applicants: Consideration will be given to applicants from outside the WWAMI region if they have ties to the WWAMI region AND come from either economically or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds and/or who have demonstrated a commitment to serving underserved populations. More information about WWAMI ties can be found on our [State Eligibility page.](/school-of-medicine/admissions/residence-certification) Graduating Physicians that Reflect the Diversity of Washington - Senate Bill 5228 In 2021, the Washington State Legislature enacted a law addressing disproportionate health outcomes by building a foundation of equity in medical training.

UW School of Medicine Summer Prematriculation Program (PreMat) [UW School of Medicine Summer Prematriculation Program ] The Office for Academic, Rural and Regional Affairs and the Office for Healthcare Equity sponsor a summer Prematriculation Program (PreMat) for medical students in Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho who have backgrounds underrepresented in medicine and/or who have been away from an intensive academic program for two or more years. The intensive scholastic enrichment program consists of coordinated activities designed to address student competencies needed for the rapid adjustment to medical school. The PreMat lectures familiarize entering students with the course content taught early in medical school, while providing experiential learning and activities aimed at connecting students with peers, faculty, and advisors. The aim is for students to become acquainted with available resources to support their academic success. "}
