This evidence should be 'patient or rogi based' in addition to being 'disease or roga based' in accordance with the fundamental principles of Ayurveda. How this is made possible? - A thorough and complete recording of the patient's medical history, capturing every minute aspect of his/her lifestyle. - A thorough head-to-toe clinical examination, uncovering health risk factors that the patient is unaware of, directly connected or unrelated with his presenting medical complaint(s). - This process of detailed history recording and clinical examination- which includes the classical Srotha-Vikrti pariksha - leads to an accurate understanding of the Dosha status of the individual and lays the foundation for an accurate differential diagnosis and medical management. - Further, the patient is entitled to be clearly informed about the diagnosis arrived at, as also understand the medical management proposed for him. The Physician shall proceed only with the patient's informed concurrence. The rigour in diagnosis is followed through with treatment that is systematically planned and documented to ensure safety and efficacy. Patient data is systematically captured and documented in every case and at each stage of medical management. Patient Safety is a key deliverable throughout the treatment cycle and a key process design element. Outcomes are scientifically tracked through the treatment cycle, in addition to recording of patient feedback at regular intervals up to 1 year post discharge. KAPC's protocol and process driven approach enables physicians and caregivers to learn faster, work together effectively, helps detect compromises in service quality and to take preventive and corrective steps. Everything that ultimately serves our patients' interests best. The KAPC protocol shall continuously evolve both in range and depth of scope, as part of a controlled process, as is to be expected from any serious system and framework of applied knowledge Refer A Patient Once we have received the completed information we will contact your office to obtain the appropriate patient information and medical records and any authorizations needed beforehand. We will then notify the patient and arrange for an appointment. Note: The patient will undergo a full KAPC Consultation before starting treatment to ascertain his/her present health condition. Our approach Down to the root cause : Ayurveda gets down to the root cause and does not limit itself to treating symptoms. At KAPC we have built on this inherent property of Ayurveda in a number of ways: - Our Physicians follow a protocol of recording relevant patient medical details and thorough clinical examination. This maximizes the probability of uncovering all important past and present clinical information, and requires the physician to follow a disciplined approach in arriving at a differential diagnosis. - Diagnostic tests are prescribed only if needed. - Referrals to Allopathic specialists on our panel, as well as external experts, are made as found necessary. Customized to You : - Ayurveda recognizes that the same outward symptoms can have very different causes because of the unique constitutional differences between individuals. - A personalized regimen is recommended for different types of people. - A comprehensive prescription involving diet, lifestyle, medicine and treatment is drawn up for each individual. - This prescription is based on the stage of the disease and several other individual-specific factors.
