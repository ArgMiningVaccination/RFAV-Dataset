Email: immanuel2346@gmail.com What is a vaccine and how does it work? Vaccines prevent diseases that can be dangerous, or even deadly. They work with your body's natural defenses to safely develop protection from a disease. A vaccine helps your immune system to produce antibodies. After getting vaccinated, you have protection from that disease, without having to get the disease first. Unlike most medicines, which treat or cure diseases, vaccines prevent them.
