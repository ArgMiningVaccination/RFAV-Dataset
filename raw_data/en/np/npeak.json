High doses of vitamin C are selectively toxic to cancer cells, meaning the vitamin C fights cancer cells while leaving healthy tissue alone. Dr. Mark Levine, an internationally acclaimed researcher at the National Institutes of Health, led a team of researchers to analyze the cancer-killing effect of high-dose vitamin C treatment. They discovered that after a high dose and rapid intravenous infusion of vitamin C, large concentrations of vitamin C react spontaneously with the molecular oxygen within tumors and generates large amounts of hydrogen peroxide, which is lethal to tumor cells. Its anti-cancer benefit kills the cancer cells from the inside out by forming hydrogen peroxide based on the theory that cancer cells don't have a catalase enzyme to break hydrogen peroxide. It boosts the immune system function, fights viruses, neutralizes bacterial toxins, removes toxic metals, and enhances the function of all organ systems. Protects cells from damage caused by free radicals. It is critical for healing many acute and chronic diseases. History of High Dose Vitamin C IV Therapy In two published clinical trials, Drs. Pauling and Cameron reported that Vitamin C significantly prolonged and improved their patients' quality of lives. [[i]](#_edn1) For these trials, Pauling and Cameron used mega-doses of 10 grams (or 10,000 mg) of IV Vitamin C, followed by an additional 10 grams of oral Vitamin C. In later years, a doctor named C.G. Moertel, MD, conducted controlled clinical studies at the Mayo Clinic and reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that he was unable to replicate the results of Drs.' Pauling and Cameron. [[ii]](#_edn2) Because of Dr. Moertel's studies, for years, many health professionals disregarded high-dose Vitamin C as a viable treatment option for their patients. Yet recently, researchers from the National Institutes of Health have begun investigating Vitamin C again because new research has proven that Drs.' Pauling and Cameron were right. Dr. Levine, who discovered the Vitamin C-hydrogen peroxide-catalase connection, believed that Dr. Moertel's trials failed because he only gave his subjects Vitamin C orally, while research has proven that dozens of grams of Vitamin C must be given intravenously in order for it to work. Oral Vitamin C is completely ineffective against cancer. This is because the effect that Vitamin C has upon the body depends upon the dose that is taken. [[iii]](#_edn3) At low doses, it has anti-oxidative effects upon the body; at high doses, it has oxidant, or cancer-killing effects. In fact, there are many substances that render very different effects upon the body, depending on the dosage. The difference between a venom and cure is often in the amount. It's hard to believe, but even drinking too much water can kill you. We and other integrative doctors have treated hundreds of patients with high-dose Vitamin C, and found it to be both safe and effective. Yet this therapy hasn't worked for everyone, because there are a few variables that can undermine its effectiveness. The fact that some tumors produce larger amounts of catalase than others, which neutralizes the cancer-killing effects of hydrogen peroxide, is one variable. Also, sometimes there is an insufficient amount of oxygen in the space around the cells, which is needed for Vitamin C to produce hydrogen peroxide. For now, scientists have not found a way to stop tumors from producing catalase. However, we have found that adding Vitamin K3 to our patients' Vitamin C IVs markedly increases the creation of hydrogen peroxide in some tumors, enabling a more substantial \"kill\" in those cancers that have high catalase activity. Vitamin K3 is a synthetic form of Vitamins K1 and K2. We also use it at our clinic before and after administering low dose chemotherapy, since it also prevents metastases, or the spreading of cancer to other tissues and organs. Patients usually experience no side effects from this treatment. Benefits of High Dose Vitamin C IV Therapy For years, vitamin C has been recognized as one of the most powerful anti-oxidants available. How can a substance with antioxidant properties, produce levels of oxidative stress enough to kill cancer? The answer is simple, the effect of vitamin C in the body is dose-dependent. The research at the National Institutes of Health proved that to consistently achieve the concentration of vitamin C sufficient to provoke oxidation, a patient must receive dozens of grams of intravenous infusions of vitamin C. High doses of oral administration of vitamin C have been proven completely ineffective in tumor regression. Research has discovered the powerful anti-tumor agent of Vitamin C IV Therapy. High doses of vitamin C are selectively toxic to cancer cells, meaning the vitamin C fights cancer cells while leaving healthy tissue alone. Dr. Mark Levine, an internationally acclaimed researcher at the National Institutes of Health, led a team of researchers to analyze the cancer-killing effect of high-dose vitamin C treatment.
