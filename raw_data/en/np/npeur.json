I highly recommend CHH Clinic!!!L. L. - I'd highly recommend coming here to see Dr. Bruce, Best chiropractor and health specialist in town.J. M. - Dr. Lubitz is hands down the best chiropractor. He is helpful, knowledgeable, and accommodating. I found him while needing adjustments after a car accident. He not only took care of my back and neck pain but he also offered advice on my case. His most important priority is making people feel better! Now, any time I need assistance, I will definitely return to his office. Client for life! Thanks!Mar Jacobs - Since my stroke I haven't had very good balance and no good sleep. In just 2 treatments I'm falling asleep within a 1/2 an hour instead of 4 hours and only waking up one time at night and falling right back to sleep. This is the best treatment I have had without medication since 2002...hooray!J.M.
