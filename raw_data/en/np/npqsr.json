Degenerative disc disease cannot be cured, but it should be treated to help slow degeneration. If you don't treat degenerative disc disease complications can occur, such as: - Back stiffness and loss of flexibility [Bone spurs](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/bone_spurs/article_em.htm) - Spinal canal compression (myelopathy), which can compress the nerves - Weakness - Numbness - Tingling - Debilitating [back pain](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/back_pain_health/article_em.htm) [Neck pain](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/neck_pain_cervical_pain/article_em.htm) - Herniated discs - Loss of bladder or bowel control The goals of treatment for degenerative disc disease are to strengthen the muscles that support the back and relieve symptoms, and may include: - Home treatments [Exercise](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/exercise/article_em.htm) - Strength - Stretching - Low-impact aerobics - - Modify activities that irritate the back - Maintain a healthy weight/ [lose weight](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/weight_loss_and_control/article_em.htm)if [overweight](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/obesity/article_em.htm) - Heat and [cold](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/colds/article_em.htm)therapy - Don't smoke - Ergonomics - Proper lifting techniques - Ergonomic furniture - Supportive footwear - Avoid static [posture](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/drug-calcium_phosphate_tribasic_tricalcium_phosphate/article_em.htm)for prolonged periods of time - Medications - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) such as [ibuprofen](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/drug-ibuprofen/article_em.htm)( for pain [Narcotic](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/slideshow_pictures_prescription_drug_abuse/article_em.htm)pain relievers for severe pain - Corticosteroid injections into the disc space for inflammation - Oral [steroids](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/steroids/article_em.htm)for inflammation - Muscle relaxants - Physical therapy - Massage therapy - Chiropractic manipulation - Epidural injections - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulators (TENS) [Ultrasound](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/ultrasound/article_em.htm) [Acupuncture](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/medical_acupuncture/article_em.htm) - Behavioral therapy - Surgery - Artificial disc replacement [Spinal fusion](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/back_pain_health/article_em.htm) What Are Symptoms of Degenerative Disc Disease? Symptoms of degenerative disc disease include pain in the back: - Ranges from mild to severe and disabling - Comes and goes - Worsens when sitting or after bending, lifting or twisting - Mostly affects the lower back and neck - Extends to the arms and hands - Radiates to the buttocks and thighs - Causes weakness in the leg muscles or \"foot drop,\" which may be a sign of damage to the nerve root What Causes Degenerative Disc Disease? The pain and stiffness of degenerative disc disease is caused by the wearing down of discs in the vertebrae. The discs in the spine are relatively avascular (very little blood supply), so when discs are injured, they cannot repair themselves and they begin to deteriorate. Causes of disc degeneration include: [Aging](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/slideshow_healthy_seniors_pictures_exercise_aging/article_em.htm): discs dry out as people age - Tears in the outer portion of the disc due to daily activities and sports - Injury - Repetitive heavy lifting that can cause small tears in the discs [Smoking](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/cigarette_smoking/article_em.htm) is a risk factor for developing degenerative disc disease. How Is Degenerative Disc Disease Diagnosed? Degenerative disc disease is diagnosed with a physical examination and patient history, along with imaging tests such as: - X-rays [Magnetic resonance imaging](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/magnetic_resonance_imaging_mri/article_em.htm)( [MRI](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/magnetic_resonance_imaging_mri/article_em.htm)) scan - Computed tomography (CT) scan From Back Pain Resources Featured Centers Health Solutions From Our "}
