(Kacsmaryk oh so generously stayed his own order for seven days, meaning mifepristone should remain available until then.) Should the high court uphold the [Trump-appointed judge](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/01/matthew-kacsmaryk-mifepristone-abortion-pill-ban)'s ruling, it would be a devastating blow to abortion access nationwide\u2014 [including in states where abortion is legal](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/11/abortion-texas-mifepristone-ruling-order-threatens-access.html)\u2014and have a profound, life-altering impact on countless pregnant people. But upholding Kacsmaryk's decision wouldn't just affect mifepristone; it would, according to legal experts, give anyone seeking to get a particular drug removed from the market the opportunity to do so. If that sounds like a really f--king crazy, extremely scary, and wildly ill-conceived idea, rest assured it is indeed all of those things. But will SCOTUS actually let Kacsmaryk's ruling stand? Let's take a closer look. As The New Republic [notes](https://newrepublic.com/article/171797/mifepristone-supreme-court-roberts-kavanaugh), there are significant problems with Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA. For one thing, there's the matter of timeliness: A six-year statute of limitations seemingly precludes challenging the FDA's approval of mifepristone, which the agency green-lit more than 20 years ago. (For his part, Kacsmaryk disagreed with the plaintiffs' \"logic\" that the clock was somehow reset to 2021 after the agency denied a petition concerning a 2016 action by the FDA...and then he proceeded to act like the suit was valid anyway.) Another issue is the matter of standing to bring the lawsuit at all. As TNR writes: We're no lawyers, but that sure sounds like a pretty weak argument\u2014and yet! If the Supreme Court effectively decides, in upholding Kacsmaryk's ruling, that basically anyone at any time can bring a suit challenging some drug, medications that were approved decades ago\u2014that have been proven to be safe and effective and that millions of people rely on\u2014could suddenly be at risk because someone doesn't like them. Perhaps you can think of a couple classes of drugs that might suddenly be on the chopping block in this scenario? Per [Talking Points Memo](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/kacsmaryk-abortion-vaccine-contraception-abortion): Upholding Kacsmaryk's decision \"could allow virtually anyone to challenge any FDA drug approval decision with a good chance at succeeding,\" William Schultz, former deputy FDA commissioner and Department of Health and Human Services general counsel, told TPM on Monday. In a letter published the same day, hundreds of pharmaceutical and biotech executives issued a similarly grave warning, [writing](https://docsend.com/view/2ahvmwy8djzxax3g), in part: The one glimmer of hope is that, despite being [stacked](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/12/supreme-court-mississippi-abortion-case-roe-v-wade) with [creepy](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/05/samuel-alito-roe-v-wade-abortion-draft) [archconservatives](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/amy-coney-barrett-abortion-capital-crime) who took great pleasure in [overturning Roe v. Wade last year](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/06/the-supreme-court-has-struck-down-roe-v-wade-decision), Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA may simply be too outrageous for the Supreme Court to go along with it. As Vox correspondent and attorney Ian Millhiser [wrote](https://twitter.com/imillhiser/status/1644491544802775040) on Friday after Kacsmaryk's ruling came out: \"My best guess is that SCOTUS reverses Matty K in a 6-3 vote. This SCOTUS is awful. But I think that [justices John] Roberts, [Brett] Kavanaugh, and even [Amy Coney] Barrett probably understand that upholding this lawless order would be a declaration of war against the rule of law that they are likely to lose.\" Here's hoping.
