Over the past 50 years, rates of autoimmunity and chronic disease have exploded: Currently, one in two-and-a-half American children has an allergy; one in 11 has asthma; one in 13 has severe food allergies; and one in 36 has autism. While some attribute this rise to increased awareness and diagnosis, Thomas Cowan, MD, argues for a direct causal relationship to a corresponding increase in the number of vaccines American children typically receive - approximately 70 vaccine doses by age 18. The goal of these vaccines is precisely what we're now seeing in such abundance among our chronically ill children: the provocation of immune response. Dr. Cowan looks at emerging evidence that certain childhood illnesses are actually protective of disease later in life; examines the role of fever, the gut, and cellular fluid in immune health; argues that vaccination is an ineffective (and harmful) attempt to shortcut a complex immune response; and asserts that the medical establishment has engaged in an authoritarian argument that robs parents of informed consent. His ultimate question, from the point of view of a doctor who has decades of experience treating countless children, is what we are really doing to children when we vaccinate them.

I spent a great deal of time reading the peer reviewed research on both sides but wanted more discussion from the scientists and doctors themselves. So I downloaded to books to listen to: \"Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism\" by Dr Peter Hotez, and this book \"Vaccines, Autoimmunity, and the Changing Nature of Childhood Illness\" by Dr Thomas Cowan. Both are recognized pedestrians and both are on opposing sides of the vaccine debate. Dr Hotez, who by all definitions is an expert in vaccines and how they work, provides little to no explanation of how they work with the immune system and engages his readers/listeners as though they are too uneducated, and even too stupid, to comprehend the intricate process by which the body and vaccines work. In contrast, Dr Cowan not explains in detail how these processes work, but also explains what led to the misconceptions that are now pervasive in western medicine. Dr Cowan seeks to empower his audience with knowledge and support, whereas Dr Hotez chose to insult his listeners and spend nearly his entire time ridiculing parents and professors who are exposing the truth about vaccines and the injuries they cause. I challenge anyone to listen to both of these books and come to your own conclusions. 35 people found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [johnny_vindaloo](/listener/amzn1.account.AG3FME7TDWJ3W2VWPU62JGP2P4XA?ref=a_pd_Vaccin_c15_rvlsnl_1&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=FZ6A22JYX2TG9SBQK7A0&pageLoadId=KQDwKPFWSrBMSYEN&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 01-06-20 Wow I thought Dr. Cowan was brave to write his book on cancer, but this one goes to the heart of the current medical and political establishments far more so. Congratulations must also be given to Chelsea Green for publishing a book like this, and for publishing Dr. Cowan's other work. This is not something to be taken lightly. In the age of Google censoring natural health information online, a return to books might be our only source of information in the future.

This book seems to intentionally misrepresent science. While autoimmunity is in a shocking rise and a real threat to modern society, this is more likely due to the evolution of a modern society beyond our biological evolution. Its been proven our ultra sterile lifestyle, the foods we consume, over use of antibiotics and toxins in our society are directly linked to autoimmunity. In fact, autoimmunity uses a completely different set of cells and chemokines than immune response to vaccines. Vaccines actually use our natural immune system to our favor. Cultivation of a proper microbiome by getting kids away from the television, and playing outside has also has a direct correlation with proper antibody response. Dr Cowan does do a good job describing gaps in medical technology/knowledge for treatment of autoimmune diseases. There is a lot we don't know about medicine, immunity and vaccines. Please don't jump to conclusions. 12 people found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [John Bartemus](/listener/amzn1.account.AFTU5ASYP6QAZCU2FO5JO6VF77UA?ref=a_pd_Vaccin_c15_rvlsnl_3&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=FZ6A22JYX2TG9SBQK7A0&pageLoadId=KQDwKPFWSrBMSYEN&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 06-06-19 Excellent book on how immunity really works Dr Cowan did an excellent job of communicating how the immune system truly develops and results in healthy immunity against infectious disease. This process does not require or need to include vaccinations.

He states that infections are good to train your immune system but that is exactly what immunizations do. He states there is no elevation of immunoglobulin in asthma, but immunoglobulin E can be elevated in asthma and allergies.
