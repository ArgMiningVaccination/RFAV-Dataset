Nursing serves to maintain, or where necessary, regain or redevelop these connections.\" In August 2019 I started a course in Anthroposophic Nursing (it takes a while to get your tongue around it) @ Taruna College, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. I am excited about this new course as it will allow me to bridge my herbal medicine with my nursing knowledge and skills. Anthroposophic nursing (AN) is practice, training and research founded on the philosophies of Rudolf Steiner in conjunction with Dr. Ita Wegman. Anthroposophic nursing is a holistic extension of conventional medical science and practice. Anthroposophic nursing treats the individual as a being of body, mind, soul and warmth, and that a bridge exists between the physical and spiritual being of their patients. Through natural therapies, education and counselling, the AN calls forth the persons own healing forces to integrate health and illness into balance, this is of key importance in supporting a life of vitality. During the treatments, nurses work with the elements of warmth, rhythm, and conscious awareness. Examples include: compresses of yarrow to support liver function, chamomile for abdominal discomfort, foot baths for warmth and calm, rhythmical oiling for fatigue, grief, stress and anxiety, hydrotherapy and inhalations such as eucalyptus and chamomile for colds and sinus. What may be included in an Anthroposophic Nursing Treatment? Rhythmical Body oiling (Rhythmical Einreibung): Rhythmical oiling is a gentle therapy that is enlivening and provides a warm, expanding sensation. The natural substances that are used are chosen for their particular healing qualities for specific conditions. Through gentle rhythmical, stroking movements on certain areas of the patients body, the person's experience is relaxing, feeling one with oneself again and feeling new strength. Rhythmical lower leg oiling can help with: - Constipation - Pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatism - Heavy, tired legs - Cold extremities - Hemiplegia: associated with spasticity and limp paralysis - Circulatory problems - Oedema - A good support through labour - Insomnia/difficulty with asleep - Anxiety and panic attacks - Supports the prophylaxis of thrombosis and ulcers Rhythmical Einreibung can be applied in all clinical areas: In pediatric care, obstetrics (before and after birth), psychological medicine for all ages, child, adolescent and adult psychiatry, neurology, early rehabilitation, rehabilitation and geriatric nursing or care. Compresses: Compresses provide moist warmth on and over the skin which has a dissolving effect that seeps down to the organ that requires support. Some of the herbs and plants used are chamomile, yarrow, mustard and ginger. Foot bath: Foot baths, working with properties of water, stimulate the circulation, bring warmth and have a calming and relaxing effect. An example of substances used are fresh lemon and lavender milks. Ointment cloths: Ointment cloths help deliver plant, metal or mixed ointments (mixed with a base such as lanoline, beeswax and oil and are readily absorbed) to specific areas of the body. They can be used a number of times and provide relief for acute inflammation, emotional/heart issues, abdominal discomfort and for shock.
