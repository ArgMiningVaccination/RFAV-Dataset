This Chinese medicine has succeeded in helping people with the eye conditions listed below, and these are just a few. Acupuncture increases the blood flow in eyes and stimulates nerve cells. Its self healing properties regulate the autonomic nervous system and promote a parasympathetic response. Acupuncture is different compared to most other modern forms of medicine. It's focus is treating both the eye condition and the underlying cause. This physical medicine creates a balance both mentally and physically in order to maintain good health. Your eyes will get better and so will your overall being. If you work to preserve your vision early on, it will improve circulation, decrease inflammation, reduce oxidative stress and you'll have long time Neuro-Protection. Acupuncture treatments for eye conditions will initially require 4-5 adjacent treatments during weeks 1 and 2. The first 2 weeks will be a total of 10 back to back treatments. If we see improvement, then we will continue with treatments once a week for a month. A reassessment will take place after that month of treatments and we'll go forward with sessions once or twice a month for maintenance care. "}
