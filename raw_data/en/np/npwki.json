In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in herbal medicine due to, among other things, increasing resistance to many drugs used in orthodox medicine, and the side effects that often accompany them. Herbal medicine is also known as phytotherapy, as it is a plant-based therapy. Some herbalists, including Deanne Greenwood, who works here at the Helston Chiropractic Clinic, call themselves Medical Herbalists to denote the fact that they hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Herbal Medicine, and are therefore trained in both medical and plant sciences. How does herbal medicine work? The active ingredients found in the leaves, stems, flowers, berries, roots and bark of plants have many different properties. For example, they may be analgesic, anti-inflammatory, diuretic, laxative, stimulating or relaxing. Most plants have a number of different properties and therapeutic actions. Around 25% of pharmaceutical drugs in use today are derived from plants - but there is a big difference between using a synthetic version of a plant extract and using the whole plant! Herbal medicine is holistic, which means that it supports the whole body, on a physical and emotional level, to effect healing. It aims to get to the root cause of ill health - rather than just treating the symptoms - and discover why a person has become ill. There are usually many factors involved. Herbalists treat on an individual basis, as no two people are the same, physically or psychologically. This also explains why herbs recommended for one person may be different to those recommended for someone else, even though both people have been labeled with the same ailment! Herbal medicine works hand-in-hand with dietary and lifestyle factors, which are at the very heart of good health and healing. What can Herbal medicine be used for?
