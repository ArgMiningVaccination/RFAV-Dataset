See our full disclosure [here](https://zerowastememoirs.com/affiliate-disclosure/). What's Wrong with Traditional Kettles? [Studies have found](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51485767_Tea_brewed_in_traditional_metallic_teapots_as_%20a_significant_source_of_lead_nickel_and_other_chemical_elements) that cast iron, copper, plastic, and aluminum tea kettles with exposed heating elements can leach metals, [such as nickel](https://www.environmentalpollutioncenters.org/nickel/) and lead, into the water. Allowing these metals to accumulate in your body poses severe health risks. [Heavy metal poisoning](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lead-poisoning/symptoms-causes/syc-20354717) can cause reproductive issues, developmental delays in children, impaired brain functioning, and various cancers. Plastic tea kettles may contain BPA or BPA alternatives, such as BPS, that leach into the water over time. Studies show that heat accelerates this process, so boiling water in a plastic kettle may infuse those toxins into your tea at an alarming rate. Switching to a non-toxic water kettle ensures your favorite brew is uncontaminated by harmful chemicals and safe to drink. What to Look for in a Non-Toxic Kettle The safest tea kettle material is borosilicate glass - it can resist high temperatures, so you can use it on your stovetop without causing any damage. Stainless steel is another of the safest materials for non-toxic kettles that won't leach heavy metals into the water. Make sure you buy a kettle made from high-quality, food-grade stainless steel with a chromium-to-nickel ratio of 18/8 (304) or 18/10 (316). If you're looking for electric tea kettles, opt for one with a concealed heating element, and make sure any plastic parts are BPA and BPS-free. Look for a kettle with heat-safe materials, such as wood, on its handles and knobs to prevent nasty burns.
