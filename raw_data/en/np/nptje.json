They have given me everything I could possible want. They have boundless love and support, I am so lucky to have them. They have such a positive work ethic wh ich I try and live up to every day. I would also like to thank my two older brothers who continue to give me new reasons to look up to them. I know I can count on them for anything. I hope I make them all proud. This dissertation is a result of an academic evolution which has had many positive influences, of which the most important was Professor Mary Lou Longo at American International College. She was the first teacher to ever challenge me, the first to ever make me want to wo rk hard. She not only single h andedly raised my interest in academics to a whole new level, but her cl ass was the gateway into my love for Biochemistry. Had I not taken her class, th is dissertation would not exist. Everything I am academically, I owe to her. There are so many other professors who have influenced me. It was my Biochemistry teacher, Dr. Mani scalco, who taught me structure determines function. But it was my history teacher, Dr. Carty, who t aught me that the more we know, the more we realize we don't know. I would like to express my deepest apprecia tion to my mentors, Drs. Michael Chapman and Kenneth Taylor. I have been given a chance to explore a truly fascinating area of research, macromolecular structure det ermination by 3DEM. I am most fortunate to have been mentored by two world leaders in their fields and I owe them both eternal grat itude for their advice and patience. They are so passionate for not just science, but teaching it. I have seen t hem pay as much time and effort in helping out undergraduate students as the most senior post- docs. It is obvious they care very deeply about what they do. They create such an enriching environment. I am truly lucky to be around such great minds and wonderful role models. I am grateful to be surrounded by so m any great scientist. There are so many that have helped me one way or another along the way. I would like to thank the past and present members of Dr. C hapman's group, particularly: Qing, Weishu, Omar, Jeff, v Felcy, Eliza, Dan, Tom, Dustin, and Heather . Also, the past and present members of Dr. Taylor's group, particularly: Dianne, Jun, Hanspeter, Sandy, Zhong, Feng, Anthony, Cheri, Guiqing, Aguang, Zhuan, and Anthony. They have all helped me throughout my research. A special thanks goes to Qing and Tom for their advice and encouragement, to Dianne for specimen preparation, and to Z hong who has let me bother him so many times with questions regarding data processing. I must express additional gratitude to Jun who taught me how to prepare ice- embedded samples and how to use the micro scopes. I was associated with Jun during my early stages of Cryo-EM. As a member of Dr. Chapman's lab, I was not in the same laboratory as Jun, a member of Dr. Taylor's lab. But whenever he would see me in the hallway, he would always stop me and ask about my research. He always offered bits of advice, encouraged me to be a part of the EM Journal club, and made me feel connected to the \"cryo-EM\" community at FSU. This meant so much to me. Although, I was a novice to Cryo-EM at the time I worked with Jun, I knew I was lucky to be around him, that he was going to be great. In a good-bye email to me, Jun said the kindest, most flattering words that I have not for gotten to this day. I wish him the best. I would like to express my sincer est appreciation to Dr. Joan Hare, an extraordinary talent, an endless source of knowledge, and wonderful asset to the community. I was very lucky to have had her assistance in cell cu lturing, and growing and purifying our virus. She was always ava ilable for me whenever I needed her advice, both in research and on a personal le vel. I will be fore ver grateful. A special thanks goes to Dr. Mike Zawrot ny. I can safely speak on behalf of the biophysics community when I say I am so very grateful to have him in the building. It's hopeless to count the number of times he has helped me out with computer issues. I owe him so much. A special thanks goes to Kim Riddle and Tom Fellers, who were so patient in teaching me how to use the microscopes. They do a magnificent job of running the BSIR facility and taking care of the microsc opes. We in the cryo-EM community at FSU owe them a great deal of gratitude. vi I have received wonderful advice from so many over the years. Drs. Tim Logan, Scott Stagg, Soma, Claude, have helped me out, and I thank them all. Wade, Ed, and Rick have also helped me out over the y ears. They do a great job making sure everything is running. Last but not least, to my friends, colleagues, and the biophysics community, thank you. vii TABLE OF CONTENTS List of T ables .............................................................................................................ix List of fi gures ..............................................................................................................x List of Abbrev iations .................................................................................................xiii Abstract ....................................................................................................................xv i 1.

It was called the K ilham rat virus (KRV) after its discoverer, L. Kilham and the organism in which it was found [4]. In the years to come, numerous other viruses were discove red each having similar genetic make-up (single stranded DNA) and physical characterist ics both in size and regularity as the KRV. Some of these were di scovered as contaminants of laboratory tumor-containing tissue during research experiments, such as Toolan's H1 virus [10]. Other viruses were discovered as contaminants of viral stocks, for example the Hallaeur's LuIII virus and Minute Virus of Mice (MVM) [10-12]. In 1964, another similar virus was found in the greater wax moth showcasi ng the broad host range ext ends beyond vertebrates and into insects [13]. In the mid 60's, an infectious agent of similar character was found to be responsible for epidemics of enteritis , panleukopenia and congenital cerebellar ataxia in felines. It now known as the feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) [14]. In 1978, an FPV-like virus was discovered in canines , which quickly spread worldwide in less than a year as a panzootic disease of dogs [15-17]. It is now know as the canine parvovirus [18]. Around the same time that FPV was discovered, a similar looking virus was discovered in tissue cultures known to be infected with the adenovirus. It was soon revealed that the new virus was defective in replication by themselves but could replicate if in the presence of the Adenovirus. As a result, they were called \"adenovirus- associated virus\" because they required t he presence of the adenovirus during the infection process for successful infection [19, 20]. The term \"parvovirus\" emerged in 1966 by C. Brailovsky who was studying the Rat K virus [21]. The term comes from the Latin word, \"parvus\", meaning small. The name strived to categorically describe all the newly found viruses; canine and feline virus, the Rat K virus, adenovirus-associated virus, and others. Indeed, they were all 2 small. During the 70's, the growing population of different but similar viruses warranted a new taxonomic family. The Internationa l Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) created the Parvoviridae family. However, in addition to the parvovirus name, a group of scientist supported the name \"pic odnavirus\" due to the small (pico) size and genetic make-up (dna). Today, the parvoviridae family consists of Parvovirinae and ae. The Parvovirinae is of three genera. The first genus is the Parvovirus genus, ccmposed of species that infect a variety of animals, such as dogs (Canine parvo virus), rats (Kilham rat parvovirus), and geese (Goose parvovirus). The second genus is the Erythrovirus containing only one species, the B19 virus. The B19 virus is the only known hum an pathogen in the entire Parvoviridae, causing erythema infectiosum or fifth disease. Common in children, fifth disease first starts with a rash on the c heek (\"slapped-cheek syndrome\") which spreads to the arms and trunk. Fortunately, child ren quick recover from infection [22]. Collectively, these two genera are called \" autonomous\" because they can replicate by themselves. This is in contrast to the th ird genera, the Dependovirus, which requires the presence of a 2nd virus, a \"helper virus\" to pr opagate. This genera contains the adeno- associated virus (AAV) species with 8 seroty pes. A serotype is defined as a virus with a distinguishing set of antibodies that react only to that vi rus without cross reacting to another. Each serotype is identified by a num ber after its name. (i.e. Adeno-associated virus serotype 2 = AAV-2). The crystal struct ures of some Paroviruses are shown figure1. All parvovirus species are small a T=1 protein capsid ~18-26nm [23] (Fig 1.1). Within this c apsid is a single stranded DNA molecule that is approximately 5000 nucleot ides in length. Depending on the species, DNA strands of both positiv e and negative polarity may be packaged inside the capsid. (The negative strand is a comple ment of the transcribed RNA that is subsequently translated into proteins. The positive strand is the complement of the negative strand, thus nearly identical with the RNA strand except for a Uracil base substituted for Thymine base. Thus, viruses with a pack aged positive strand may infect cells but undergo abortive infection. This genome contains two genes, one encoding proteins 3 required for building the capsid (Cap protei ns) and another for non-structural (NS) or replication (Rep) proteins. The total number of proteins encoded by the Parvovirus family varies between members, a result from alternative splicing and multiple promoters. To this end, 3 or 4 Rep proteins and up to 3 c apsid proteins designated Vp1, -2 & -3 are produced. The genome is flank ed by inverted terminal repeats, approximately 100-300 bps in length with t he capacity to form T-shaped, hairpin secondary structure[24]. These serve varied ro les such as the priming site for DNA replication and the coordinati on of site-specific integrat ion into the host genome. Figure 1.1: Electron density representat ion of some members of the Parvovirus family. Each are colored similarly according to radius from inside (red) to outside (grey). 60-me r PDB's were created with symmetry expansion using the Uppsala software package. Electron density maps at 10\u00c5 were created using pdb2mrc of EMAN. The surface of B19 looks somewhat different when calculated from the atom ic coordinates, because external portions of the surface loops were not resolved in the crystallographic structure [6]. Abbreviation are as the first of the serotypes within the dependovirus genus to be cloned [25]. This facilitated in vitro production and the unveiling of detailed biological and physical information. It is model ed the [26] \"type species\" for this wealth of information [26]. The single stranded genome is approximatel y 4.7kilobases (kb) in length (Fig 1.2). Flanking both ends are inverted terminal repeat s of 145 nucleotides in length, which are known to be involved in DNA replication, gene expression regulation, site specific integration, rescuing and packaging [27]. The terminal repeats are at the ends of two open reading fr ames (ORF's), one encoding Rep proteins (Rep ORF) and the other capsid proteins (Cap ORF). The gene encoding the Rep proteins contains two prom oters at map unit regions, p5 and p19. (Genomes are often diagra mmed and annotated with a particular scale. Here, the p5 and p19 terms represent relative map units. (e.g. 50 relative map units corresponds to the middle of the genome. Each of these promoters produces a full-length protein and two additional splice variants. In total the Rep ORF yields 4 proteins, Rep40, Rep52, Rep68 and Rep78. (The numbers after \"Rep\" relate the mass in kilo Daltons (kDa)). The second ORF has a single promoter at position p40 that produces 3 capsid proteins, Vp1, Vp2 and Vp3. Two mRNA's are produced from alternative splic ing of the Cap ORF. One m RNA is translated just downstream of the splice acc eptor. This produces the largest capsid protein, Vp1. Figure 1.2: The organiz ation of the AAV-2 genom e. The genome has two open reading frames (ORF) which are shown as grey boxes. These ORF's encode replicative proteins (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins. Flanking the ends of the genome are Inverted termina l repeats (ITR) that are shown in nantucket red. There are th ree promoters in the gen ome, denoted as p5, p19 and p40 which correspond to relative map units. Alternative splicing leads to 7 mRNA transcripts, 4 of which give rise to Rep proteins (blue boxes and 3 capsid protein (green boxes). P5 and p19 give rise to a splice and unspliced mRNA transcript. Tranlation is initiated just down stream of the splice acceptor site. Vp2 and Vp3 are translated further down stream. Dashed line is shown to indicate the promoter site. 5 other mRNA is translated fu rther downstream at two diffe rent initiation codons (map position 56 and 60) resulting in successively shorter capsid proteins, Vp2 and Vp3 respectively. The alternative splicing and mult iple initiating codons is reflected in the molecular weights of the capsid proteins with Vp1, Vp2 and Vp3 having masses of 87 kDa, 73 kDa, and 62kDa respectively. Each of these are translated from mRNA in phase with one another creating identical C-termini. Vp3 contains 533 amino acids, while Vp2 and Vp1 are extended by 65 and 137 am ino acids respectively [28]. They are present in the capsid at a ratio of 1:1:10. While Vp2 has been shown to be dispensable for capsid assembly and infection, Vp1 is not [29]. In the N-te rminus of Vp1 is a phospholipase A 2 domain which is believed to be involved in endosomal escape during the infection process [30, 31]. In fact, th is domain is found in many parvoviruses [32- 37]. Additionally conserved among the was determi ned by X-ray crystallography to 3\u00c5 in 2002 [42]. It revealed a T=1 icosahedral symme try constructed from 60 subunits (Fig 1.3 and 1.4). At the core of each subuni t is a canonical 8 stranded anti-parallel -barrel motif (commonly known as a \"jelly roll\"), a motif found in nearly all subunits of icosahedral viral capsids [43, 44]. Between the strands in the -barrel are large loop insertions decorating most of the capsid surface and creating a unique surface topology. Each loop is identified by the two -strands which flank it. (i.e. the HI loop is located between the H and I strands of the jelly roll). The largest and most di stinctive of these loops are the GH loops. A GH loop from one subunit interdigitates with a GH loop from a symmetry related neighbor. These form lar ge peaks surrounding each three-fold axis of symmetry. These prominent pe aks are the hallm ark of AAV-2. Less prominent loops may be found elsewher e on the surface of the capsid. Five DE loops form the outer rim of a clear channel of which the 5-fold axis of symmetry runs through. Around the perimeter of this channel is another loop, the HI loop, which overlaps neighboring subunits. A s equence comparison between CPV and AAV-2 revealed that amino acids located in t he loop regions have lower sequence identity (<15%). In fact, the varied surface topology of all parvovirus is determined to a large 6 extent to differences in the loop regions [42]. To facilitate discussions about AAV-2's well-studied surface topology, particular areas of the capsid surface were bestow ed with generic names descr ibing their overall shape. Common terms are the \"channel\" or \"cylinder\", \"d imple\", and \"peaks\" (lower panel Fig. 1.3). These describe the 5-, 2-, and 3-fold areas respectively. Surrounding the 5-fold channel is a shallow surface depression. It should not be described as a canyon as this may inappropriately define a biol ogical function to this area by way of the \"canyon hypothesis\". The canyon hypothesis was developed in species within the picornavirus family and describes viral-host interactions under i mmune surveillance. It explains how certain animal viruses have evolved to develop narrow canyons that are large enough for a Figure 1.3: An overview of the struct ure of AAV-2 (created as described in figur e 1 at a resolution of 5\u00c5). The map is colored from inside to outside as red to grey respective ly. The view is down a 2-fold axis of symmetry. In the bottom row are close ups of the dashed circles on top. T hese are areas which are commonly described as the 5- fold channel, 2-fold dimple, and the 3- fold peaks. Much of the surface of AAV-2 (and Parvoviruses in general) is decorated with loops. The HI loops are indicated. 7 receptor to bind but too narrow for a neutra lizing antibody to bind. Unlike AAV-2's surface 5-fold depression, the canyons in some members of the rhinovirus species have been proven to be the sites of antibody atta chment [45, 46]. Fo r AAV-2, amino subunit of AAV-2 (RSCB entry 1LP3) in a side view (A) and top view (B). Sixty subunits assemble together with icosahedral symmetry to gener ate an entire capsid. (The electron density of an intact capsid is shown in Figure 1.3.) This is the 533 residue C-terminal portion of the capsid protein, which is common to all subunits. The subunit has a common barrel or \"jelly roll\", an 8 stranded anti-parallel beta sheet. The strands are designated with a letter. The jelly ro ll is formed from two 4-stranded sheets, BDIG and CHEF. Between the strands are large loops (blue). These form most of the surface topology. Helices are are colored yellow. 8 implicated in antibody binding are lo cated along the si de of the three fold peaks, away from the canyon and n ear the primary receptor binding site. Inasmuch as the area around the 5-fold of AAV-2 has not been proven to be the site of receptor attachment, the term \"canyon\" is unwarranted and should be withheld in reservation. 1.1.4 The receptor binding site The crystal structure of AAV-2 was important. It came at a time when much research about its molecular biology was posing many questions that could only be answered with structural analysi s. In 1998, Summerford et al . proposed that the primary receptor for AAV-2 was the cell surface proteoglycan, heparin sulfate [47]. Soon thereafter, Wu et al, through mutational analyses revealed a cluster of basic residues that if mutated, would prevent receptor binding [39]. With t he crystal structure solved, it was possible to place a location on all the amino acids in its capsid and those that abolished heparin binding (hep-), two arginines, R 448/585 and R 451/588 , which were located along the side of each three fold peak separated by a ~25\u00c5 valley [42]. (Two conventions for residue numbering are well-est ablished in the literature, one counting from the N-terminus of VP2, the other from VP1 and differing by 137 (for AAV-2). Here, to minimize ambiguity, both will be pr ovided in the form VP2/VP1.) Other hep- mutations were found along and around the floor of the valley as we ll as underneath and buried in the peak. The electrostatic surface reveal ed a positively charge d surface along the shoulder of each three fold peak. Other basic residues were locate d in the vicinity of the hep- mutants. The proximity of residues R 350/487 , R347/484 , K390/527 and K 395/532 along the side of the 3-fold peak suggest that this positively char ged region was the heparin binding site. The spacing between each peak, ~20\u00c5 afforded th e idea that a single elongated heparin polysaccharide could bind multivalently to the capsid surface. This was proposed for the foot and mouth disease virus to describe how strong binding could be achieved through the utilization of many, weak interaction sites [48]. A short time later, two mutagenic studies tested for which amino acids were implicated in receptor bind ing. They both confirmed that basic residues along the shoulder of the 3-fold peaks we re important for re ceptor binding [49, 50]. Although the level of importance differed for some re sidues amongst the two studies, it was 9 unanimous that a cluster of positively charged residues on the side of each 3-fold peak were involved with heparin binding. Residues implicat (Fig 1.5). The involvement of this positively charged area was supported by a third mutagenic study [5 ]. In this latter study, a second cluster of residues were found to be important for infection. These residues are located near the heparin binding site. Mutating these re sidues had no affect on heparin binding but resulted in significantly diminished transducti on of cells. They concluded this area of the virus surface to be involved in co-receptor bi nding. At the time of this study, Fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 was implicated as a co-receptor [51]. Moreover, this area's proximity to the heparin binding site in conjunction with the a priori knowledge of FGFR's involvement in binding AAV-2 and heparin, led the authors to propose a model for FGFR binding to AAV-2. Additional detail regarding heparin and co-receptor interaction will be discussed in chapter below and in chapter 4.

A dashed box highligh ts a set of 3-fold related peaks. Right: A trimer in ribbon format of 3 subunits which form large peaks on the surface (box area in left). A yellow arrow denotes the 3-fold axis of symmetry. The subunits are colored red, yellow, and blue. The amino acids that are crucial for receptor binding are shown as spheres. Each 3-fold related peak is composed of two subunits that interdigitiate and together form a receptor binding site along one side. Thr ee receptor binding sites can be seen in this image, as related b y the 3-fold axis of s ymmetr y. 10 1.1.5 The missing N-termini In the crystal structure, wild type AAV-2 containing the full complement of capsid proteins were used to generat e crystals [42]. Vp1 and Vp2 have N-terminal extensions of 202 and 65 residues respectively. Nevertheless, only the 533 C-terminal amino acids common to each subunit were visible and m odeled into the electron density. As previously stated, the uniqu e part of Vp1, \"Vp1u\" contai ns (rAAV-2) constructed without Vp1 can assemble and package DNA however, fails to infect cells. The respective 1:1:10 ratio of Vp1, Vp2, and Vp3 equates to about 5 Vp1 and 5 Vp2 per 50 Vp3 which make the occupancy of the unique N-termini low and difficult to discern after the averaging process of crystall ography. Inherent fl exibility would further weaken the electron density [42]. The lo cation of this region wa s first proposed by cryo-EM reconstructions of AAV-2 from DNA-lacking (empty) capsid and later shown again in a second cryo-EM study of empty and DNA-con taining (full) particles [40, 52]. Reconstructions from full and empty data se ts showed a novel piece of density along the inside shell of the capsid underneath the 2-fold region. Due to its diffuse density and globular appearance, the density was called a \"fuzzy globule\". In the later study, both full and empty capsids were reconstructed into separated 3D maps. Each showed a fuzzy globule in the same location. When capsids were incubated at 65oC the intensity of the fuzzy globule diminished in both structures, hinting at movement and perhaps the exposure of the N-termini to the outside of the capsid. This latter hypothesis would be commensurate with other studies indicating t hat the unique region is exposed during the infection process [53, 54]. What do we know from other parvoviru ses? Investigating CPV and B19 suggest the N-termini maybe outside the capsid even when it is not actively infecting. The crystal structure of CPV has 65% of the 5-fold pores occupied by the N-termini [55]. Since the volume in the 5-fold pore allows only one N- termini per 5-fold, t he unique parts of Vp1 and/or 2 may be both internal and external. A recent cryo-EM investigation into bot h empty B19 (eB19) and is composed of two proteins, Vp1 and Vp2, which share co mmon C-termini and are 83kDa and 58kDa 11 respectively. Vp1 accounts for 95% of the mass in the capsid shell. A crystal structure of only Vp2 virus like particle (VLP) has been determined. Difference map analysis between the cryo-EM reconstructions (Vp1 a nd Vp2) and the crystal structures (VP2 only) indicate that the N-terminus of V p1 is externalized on the outside. Difference density extends from the last ordered amino acid in the cryst al structure, located along the inside of the shell, through the capsid sh ell towards the outside. The placement of this difference density indicates that the N-terminus is extruded between subunits in the capsid shell as opposed to CPV which is along the 5-fold channel. Structural data on AAV-2 to support prio r cryo-EM information about the unique regions of AAV-2 has not surfaced and t he whereabouts of the N-terminus remains elusive. Ultimately, reconstructions schemes which do not impose icosahedral symmetry may prove to be the required step in discovering its location. 1.2 Infection: Cell identificat ion, penetration and uncoating 1.2.1 Introduction The primary, if not only goal in the life of a virus is to infect, replicate, exit and repeat. A number of events in the proper sequenc e must play out in order for this to occur. First and foremost, when not actively infecting the nucleic acid must be safely harbored such that during tr ansit between cells and host or ganisms it is securely protected from damage. However, this protection must be robust since after the cell has been penetrated by the virus, the protection must break down or \"uncoat\" and allow the cellular replicative machinery access. The fi rst step in the infection process is the localization and attachment to cell surfac e molecules called receptors. Receptor composition in many different viruses is diverse with protein, carbohydrates and glycolipids all known to be constituents. Their distribution predominantly determines host range, cell tropism and any pathogenic symptoms which may occur. For example, only human and apes are known to be susceptible to rhinovirus infection because of the presence of a specific type of receptor required, the Intr acellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) [56]. Receptor as heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) to ce ll-type specific such as CD4 found on the surface of lymphocytes, a target for HIV. 12 Receptor specificity extends not only to species but to serotypes within a family. The Picornaviradae is a good example. This family contains numerous animal species such as the poliovirus and foot and mouth di sease virus (FMDV) in addition to the rhinovirus of which there ar e over 100 serotypes [57]. A large portion of these serotypes (>78) bind ICAM-1, the major group rhinovir us receptor while others bind low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) [ 56, 58-60]. Often, attachment to a single receptor is insufficient for infection and there is a requirem ent for another receptor. In this role, the first receptor (primary or a ttachment receptor) se rves to locate the virus to the cell surface where it has a greater chance of bi nding the second receptor (co-receptor or secondary receptor), which often has higher affinity[61]. 1.2.2 Mechanism of entry Receptor binding is only the first step in the infection process. Afterwards the virus must penetrate the cell membrane and expos e its genetic material for replication. A number of markedly different mechanisms exis t for cell penetration. It is well out of the limits of this thesis to describe all in detail. Those discussed here are amongst those that are well-studied and have played instrumental roles in progressing the field of virology. They serve here as paradigms. 1.2.2.1 Enveloped virus penetration The Influenza virus, causative agent of the flu, has a lipid bi-layer membrane surrounding an eight dsRNA segmented genome. Influenza virus binds neuraminic acid (sialic acid) which is expressed on the surface of the lining of lung epithelial ce lls. As a result of successful infection, damage to this tissue triggers the cough and sneeze re flex, common pathological symptoms. Approximately 1200\u00c5 in diameter, the memb rane of influenza has three glyco-proteins which stick out radially ~140\u00c5 engendering a studded appear ance when visualized by EM [62]. Infection can apt ly be described as a fusion event between the membranes of the influenza and host cell. This fusion event is entirely driven by the three glyco- proteins, hemagglutinin, neuramidase, M2. Hemagglutinin (HA) is a homotrimeric type 1 integral membrane protein of approximately 135\u00c5 in length (Fig 1.6). HA is the protein responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion. Ea ch monomer is composed of a long -helical fibrous stalk and globular head. In t he globular head are located three receptor binding sites 13 (one per monomer) outlined by a shallow pocket ~5\u00c5 deep and ~12\u00c5 in diameter. The presence of a pocket-like motif is common in animal viruses and will be discussed in greater detail below. Interestingly, the globular head has an 8- stranded beta sheet motif known as a \"Swiss roll\" or \"jelly roll\", which is found in non-enveloped capsid subunits. Neurimidase (NA) is a homotetrameric type 2 integral membrane protein which projects approximately 150\u00c5 radially and has a \"mushroom\" shaped appearance in EM images [63]. Its primary role is cleaving sialic acid, a function entirely opposite to HA. However, this contradictory function helps Influenza solve a \"stickiness\" problem, which results when newly formed virus particles exit the cell and rebind previous host cell receptor molecules. Additionally, it helps the move ment through mucus in the respiratory tract [61]. M2 is a homotetrameric type 3 integr al membrane protein with an ecto-, transmembrane-, and cytoplasmic dom ain of 24, 19, 54 residues in length. M2 functions as a proton channel pump and is responsible for lowering the pH of the endosome- Figure 1.6: The Hemmagglutinin (HA) of influenza and its role in infection. A) The crystal structure of HA (RSC B entry 4HMG) is shown in the upper left. HA is composed of 3 monomers, (colored red, lite blue, and blue) each has a globuler head (H2) and a fibruous stalk (H1). Near the interior of the stalk is a fusion peptide (col ored back, arrowhead). In H2 is a receptor binding site for sialic acid (arrow and pink spheres). In negatively stained EM images, as shown to the right of A, the HA along with Neuramidase and M2, integral membrane proteins, may be visualized. B) A flow chart shown how HA undergoes a conformational change to allow infection. See text for details. P anel B from J.M White (1995) [2] 14 containing influenza. In turn, this triggers a larger conformational change in HA which is required for endosomal escape. After receptor binding and endocytosis, fusion may be described in 4 steps (Fig 1.6): 1) Irreversible conformation change in HA : The M2 protein, acting as a proton pump, shuttles H+ into the endosomal lumen. This lowe rs the pH to ~5-6 which induces a large conformation change and exposes a sm all hydrophobic peptide sequence from within the trimer stalk. This peptide, known as the \"fusion peptide\", is inserted into the endosome membrane and facilitates the ju xtaposition of the two membranes. 2) Formation of hemi-fusion intermediate: Clu stering of HA trimers with their fusion peptides inserted into endosome membrane. Membranes may dimple towards one another. 3) Reversible opening of fusion pore: Membranes between the endosome and influenza open and close, a process known as \"flickering\". 4) Irreversible opening of fusion pore: Dila tion of membrane between HA molecules allows the exposure of contents into the cytosol. 1.2.2.2 Non-enveloped viral entry. The rhinovirus, causativ e agent of the common cold is a small non-enveloped virus with over 100 different serotypes. It has a small (~300\u00c5 in diameter) protein shell surroundi ng a single stranded RNA genome (~7kb). The crystal structure, so lved in 1985 by Rossman et al. revealed P=3 capsid architecture constructed from 3 proteins, Vp1-4, Vp2, and each of which have a canonical 8-stranded, antiparallel -barrel motif [64]. Between these strands are large loop insertions which decorate the surface and generate a surface topology that is remarkably rougher than that found in plant spherical viruses (Fig 1.7). One notable feature is a large fissure or \"canyon\" surrounding the 5-fold vertex of symmetry that is about 4 \u00c5 deep and 12 \u00c5 wide (Fig 1.7A and B). Th is canyon is the central object of the canyon hypothesis which simply states that the rhinovirus and possibly other animal viruses evolved a strategy to circumvent immunological surveillance by developing fissures that are just lar ge enough for receptor attach ment but inaccessible to antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies are those that bind to a virus and prevent infection. Since it was first conceptualized, the cany on hypothesis has been supported with multi- faceted data. For example, plant viruses that do not have an immune system to evade 15 such as Satellite Tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) and tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) appear to have a smoother surface topology [65, 66]. Also, amino acids lining the canyon are more conserved than those exposed so areas that are accessible to antibodies are more susceptible to mutate and evade detection [67, 68]. Moreover, the cryo-EM structure of rhinovirus complexed with a 2 domain fragment of its cellular receptor showed that indeed the receptor bound directly into the canyon (Fig. D and E) [69]. The steps in the rhinovirus infection pathway and of non-enveloped viruses in general are less clear than their enveloped counter-parts, although some clues exist. Icosahedral viruses face a contradiction in te rms of need when it comes to shielding its nucleic acid. When it is not actively infect ing, the protein shell must be secure and unlikely to break apart. However, at the appropr iate moment it must lower its protection and break down or \"uncoat\" to expose its genome for replicating. It is speculated that Figure 1.7: The canyon hypothesis. The rhinovirus 5-fold canyon and its role in immune surveillance.

The st ick with black pentagon denotes the 5-fold axis which is in the plane of the page. Red is the density of the rhinovirus. Green is the receptor for HRV and the dashed \"U\" shape represents the variable region of an antib ody. The point of this panel is to shown that the canyon is larger enough for a receptor to bind, but too small and inaccessible for antibody. D) A cyro-EM map of HRV 16 at 28\u00c5. E) An HRV16-Fab complex at 28\u00c5. The FAb density is colored green, in panels A,D, and E the HRV density is colored from inside to outside the capsid as red to grey respectively. 16 uncoating is initiated by the cell upon rec eptor binding or at a later stage in an endosome. Here, the low pH environment may induce a conformational change in the capsid. In turn, this releases or exposes a component of the capsid normally unexposed which facilitates entry. Both t he rhinovirus and poliovirus have along the interior of the capsid shell a hydrophobic, myristolated VP4 N-terminus. If this N- terminus was exposed it could help create a cl oser proximity of t he virus to endosomal membrane and aid in escape [61, 70]. Evidenc e for a receptor-induced conformational change is put forth by incubating HRV14 ( 149S) with soluble receptor fragments of ICAM-1 which generates 80S empty virus she lls. However, no similar conformational change was observed when incu bating fragments of ICAM-1 with HRV16, indicating more than one pathway is possible fo r major group receptor serotypes. 1.2.3 Infection pathway of AAV-2 1.2.3.1 Primary r eceptor binding. The first crucial step in the infection process by AAV-2 is binding to primary receptor Hepar in Sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), a highly sulfated polysaccharide attached to an integral membrane protein that is found on the surface of most mammalian cells [71]. H eparan sulfates are a family of highly charged polysulfonated complex ca rbohydrates with molecu lar weights up to ~105 kDa that decorate the cellular surface. They are in volved in a number of regulatory processes such as cell growth, development and angi ogenesis [71-73]. Their actions and interactions are perhaps best understood wit h fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and antithrombin [9, 74-79].The latter has led to the production of various \"heparin\" fractions, heterogeneous mixt ures processed/ isolated from the pig intestine and used, for example, to modul ate clotting. These preparations are often close enough analogs to substitute for heparin sulfate as indicated for AAV-2 binding on affinity columns and binding competition assays. [80-83] Heparin-protein complex atomic structur es have shown that interactions are dominated by large numbers of arginines forming ionic pair s with sulfate groups, and this is supplemented by polar interactions wit h sugar hydroxyls [48, 74, 75, 77, 78, 84]. Beyond this there is little conservation of a binding motif so recognition of binding sites based on sequence alone can be difficult [85]. The capsid surface of AAV-2 has its most positively charged region from arginines from two subunits and several parts of their 17 sequence come together. This site has subs equently been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis [5, 49, 50]. Like the site in FMDV subtype 01, less positive charge is concentrated here than in other heparin-bindi ng proteins, leading to the suggestion that these viruses achieve strong binding by si multaneously binding at several of the 60 symmetrically equivalent sites. HSPG bi nding is predominantly driven by nonspecific electrostatic interactions. However, other more specific modes of binding have been suggested possible [49, 71]. Kern et al per formed a docking simulation showing several amino acids in close proximity to the docked macromolecule. While many of these were previously within 3\u00c5, indicating possibl e role in receptor binding. The authors suggested that threonine could be involved via. hydrogen bonding while the aspartic acids may play a role in charge neutralizat ion of the basic residue cluster composing putative receptor binding location. Ou r findings on this matter will be discussed in Chapter 4. 1.2.3.2 Co-receptor binding. A major determinant to AAV's wide cell tropism is the ubiquity of HSPG[86]. Howe ver, after cell transduction experiments showing 50% variation in AAV's capacity to transduce donor cells and a cell line, NIH3T3, which could bind the virus effectively but not be transduced, the possibility of co-receptors for efficient infections was investigated. Init ial experiments, warranted by HSPG's natural interaction with fibroblast gr owth factor (FGF) and its re ceptor, FGFR, confirmed the requirement of human FGFR-1 as a co -receptor for AAV-2 infection [51]. To date there are four known FGFR's (FGFR1-4) and 22 factors (FGF1-22) which bind [87]. FGF's have numerous biologic al roles in both the developing embryo and the adult such as cell growth, diffe rentiation, migrat ion, angiogenesis and chemotaxis of re ceptors have been identif ied with different affinities. One class, categorizing those rece ptors with high affinity is the fibroblast growth factor receptor and t here are four, FGFR 1-4. Each has an extracellular binding domain with up to three immunoglobulin Ig-l ike domains, a membrane spanning helix, and a cytoplasmic domain with tyrosine kinase activity [90, 91]. Ligand kinase domains stimulates their transphosphorylation activity, potentiati ng further signaling within the cell. FGFR 18 dimerization is dependent on the presence of heparin sulfate proteoglycan, the second class of FGF receptors [92-94]. These functi on as a storage reservoir for FGF to first bind and locate FGF to the cell surface so it is in closer proximity to FGFR [88, 95]. Crystal structures of ternar y FGF-FGFR heparin complexes provide structural reasoning for receptor dimerization and activation and show that when heparin binds two FGFR molecules, a canyon is formed by positive charges and extends to heparin binding sites on the FGF ligands. (See Fig. A.2 in the appendix for a diagram of a crystal structure of an FGF-FGFR-heparin ternary complex). In addition to FGFR, other co-receptors have been proposed including V5 and V1 hepatocyte receptor [96-99]. 1.2.3.3 Cell entry of AAV-2. The infection pathway of AAV-2 has been proposed (Fig. 1.8) [1]. Subsequent to co-receptor binding, AAV-2 is endocytosed in a fashion by clathrin coated pits [1, 100, 101]. Integrins have been documented to be involved a number of events including: motility, cell-cell adhesion, internalization and degradation of extracellular matrix molecules as well as interactions with Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 GTPases, molecules demonstrated to be connected with signal cascades [102-104]. A pathway has been proposed for an AAV-2 infection by binding HSPG and V5 [1]. Initial attachment to the cell surface is facilitated by HSPG where co-rec eptor binding occurs. Once bound to V5, Rac1 a Figure 1.8: Schematic representation of AAV entry and endocytic trafficking in HeLa cells. Following binding to cell surface HSPG (A), AAV is rapidly internalized via clathrin-coated pits (B) through a process involving avb5 integrin. Once internalized, the virus encounters a weakly acidic environment which is sufficient to allow penetration into the cytosol (C). Following endosome release, AAV accumulates peri nuclearly (D) and slowly penetrates through the NPC into the nucleus (E). (Figure and figure legend adapated from Bartlett et al. [1, 2]) 19 small GTP binding protein is stimulated which is closely lin ked to phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PIP-3) pathway required for the move ment of AAV-2 along microtubules and/or microfilaments to the nucleus [105, 106]. Interestingly, the Adenovirus is also mediated by Rho GTPases, Rac1 and PI3K pat hways [107]. Recently, Notch-1 has been shown to play an integral role in rAAV- 2 transduction. Notch-1 is a transmembrane receptor expressed as a heterodimer. U pon ligand binding, dy namin stimulate the cleavage and release of the in tracellular domain, which is known to be involved with nuclear trafficking with the activation of proteins such as phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, Rho, and Rack, all previously to be associ ated with rAAV2 trafficking [106]. Following internalization into early endosomes, AAV- 2 is routed to late endosomes where an acidic environment aids in the egress, pres umably with the exposure of Vp1 termini [53, 100]. Perhaps, through associated with unk nown transport proteins, AAV-2 quickly accumulates perinuclearly and enters the nucleus either through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) or by way of NPC-indep endent disruption of the outer nuclear membrane as intact particles [53]. 1.2.4 Gene Therapy 1.2.4.1 Introduction. The fundamental goal of gene therapy is to alleviate a diseased state (or predispositions) caused by a malf unctioning gene with the treatment of genetic material. The material contains the correct gene sequence that could be used by a cell and read into a functional product. Genera lly, all approaches in gene therapy may be categorically placed into two areas, Ex-vivo and In-vivo therapy. Ex-vivo therapy involves treating cells after their removal from the body, whereupon they are transferred back into the body . In-vivo therapy involves administering a therapeutic gene directly into a cell within the body. Common to both is the delivery of genetic material to target cells. With many diseases linked to genetic mutations, numerous gene constructs and delivery systems are being devel oped to restore fully functional genes back into cells. Some of the techniques performed to date involve hydrodynamic pressure, lipid-DNA complexes, DNA-gold particles and viral- based vector therapy [108-110]. However, despite being significantly more complex to perform, viral-based vector techniques have shown promise. Here, a viral genome is engineered with a therapeutic gene inserted in place of native genetic material. The virus is then administered and allowed to infect the 20 cells in need. Upon infection, the recombinant virus expose s its genetic material for the cellular machinery to create the functional product. Inasmuch as viruses naturally deliver their genetic material into cells, engi neered or recombinant viral-based vectors are an obvious choice for gene therapy. An i deal viral vector candidate would possess many characteristics such as having a la rge payload capacity, (i.e. the amount of genetic material that can be delivered for transduction) the ability to infect and transduce a cell of interest with sustained long-term expression, high efficiency, and little toxicity. Numerous vectors currently studied are at varying stages of development and run the full gamut from molecular biology through clinical trials. Retroviral and adenoviral vectors were popular in the early stages of gene therapy. However, negative side effects have re tarded their progress. Retroviral vectors such as lenti- and foamy viruses have large payloads and the capacity to integrate into the genome[111]. This allows the correct gene to be integrated into chromosome of dividing cells for long term expression. Howe ver, the integration is random and creates an ominous possibility of an integration site located in the middle of a gene and abolishing its function. Thus, while alleviating a disease, the retroviral vector could induce a novel one. Adenoviral vectors do not integrate into the chromosome of a cell and may infect both dividing and non-dividing cells. However, Adenoviral vectors are highly immunogenic [112]. This translates in to a possibly overwhelming strong immune reaction. Such a scenario played out in a c linical trial patient treated by an adenoviral vector [113]. 1.2.4.2 AAV as a gene therapy vector. AAV is at the forefront of gene therapy because it fulfills most of the requirements to be an i deal gene therapy vector. An important aspect of it s biology is a lack of pathogenic ity [114, 115]. Additionally, upon infection it illicits a low immune response (a potentially fatal complication with some vectors) [26]. It can infect cells independently of cell division and is widely tropic (also a disadvantage) [113, 114, 116-122]. Wild-type AAV also has a constant integration site (chromosome 19), reducing t he chance of accidentally modulating genes by random integration within the genome [123]. It is for these r easons that AAV vectors are being developed for many diseases including: AI DS, high blood pressure, cystic fibrosis, Parkinson's disease, hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy [124-144]. 21 Despite great promise, the development of vectors to transport the therapeutic gene to targeted cells remains a central chal lenge and many obstacles exist [145]. Site- specificity of AAV is modul ated by the Rep proteins which are replaced by the transducing gene in most vector constructs . So long-term transduction is predominantly through episomal elements [123, 147]. Secondly AAV' s modest genomic size (~5,000 nt's) limits the size of the gene which can be inse rted [148, 149]. Furthermore, most of the population (80%) have already been exposed so neutralizing antibodies and immune system surveillance will need to be evaded [150-152]. Finally, AAV's wide cell tropism increases the risk of erroneous and/or deleterious cell targeting. These obstacles notwithstanding, the benef its of AAV as a gene therapy vector outweigh the drawbacks and progress is being made on all these fronts. Strategies to circumvent promiscuous cell tropism include t he utilization of a more discrete serotype, the insertion of a cell-specific ligand into t he capsid, or using a bi-functional antibody to target the virus to a cell surface specific molecule [153-156]. Additionally, novel chimerc/mosaic rAAV capsid construct ed with subunits from more than one serotype have successfully been shown to alter cell tropism [157]. To overcome AAV's modest genomic size, recombinant splice variants have shown positive results. In this interesting approach, a gene of interest is cut in half and placed into two different vectors with one having a splic e acceptor site, the other a splice donor site. Upon infection, both halves of the gene are spliced together. This approach has been successful in retina, lung, and muscle, effe ctively doubling the payload to ~9kb [158]. Finally, 12 serotypes and >100 AAV variants have been discovered, increasing the potential of novel and unique cell tropism which facilitates the tailoring of a vector for cell specific transduction [116]. Today, the inherent biological advantages of AAV and the clever strategies to overcome its limitations are increasingly being exploited as a gene therapy vector and numerous clinical trials are underway, most in Phase I/II[159]. Undoubtedly, as the biology of the lesser known serotypes and vari ants surface, the potent ial of its utilization will further increase. 22 CHAPTER 2 THREE DIMENSIONAL CRYO-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY 2.1 Introduction It is the ultimate goal of a structural biol ogist, to unravel a bi ological mystery and describe it with molecular reasoning. That is , to be able to narrate the happenings of natures work with atomic level precision. In the face of such complex systems such as the human body, this requires breaking do wn the narration into chapters based on hierarchies within the body. For example, a physiological system is controlled by one or more organs which are composed of multiple tissues, each with one or more cell types that are governed by a proper metabolic state and dictated by enzymes whose instruction for building lies in DNA. This is a rather unwarranted si mplification. The point is that to understand a complex process one must break it down into smaller portions which may be studied individually. In this anal ysis we find various techniques that we can employ which are tailored with a parti cular advantage that make it ideal for a particular portion of the narration. Indeed, mu ch like a carpenter who embarks on a long journey of constructing a house, the means to an end for a structural biologist undoubtedly requires the use of various t ools for judicious measurements. In the atomic realm, X-ray crystallogr aphy and NMR spectroscopy have earned their keep. Since the first cryst al structure was determined, ov er 56,000 structures have been described, from single molecules to large assemblies [160]. Both NMR and crystallography each bring their own sets of advantages and disadvantages. In the case of the former, conformationally dynamic information can be gathered but is generally limited to objects that are <300 amino acids in size due to relaxation and spectral overlap [161, 162]. An obstacle in cryst allography is producing and purifying enough of the object of interest and ultimately forming diffraction-quality crystals. These limitations notwithstanding, both techniques have provided atomic level answers to many biological questions and continue to be powerhouse factories of information. However, how does one approach stru ctural questions involving three- dimensional (3D) analysis of large subcellular, macromolec ular assemblies that are not 23 amenable to crystal formation and too large for NMR spectroscopy? It is here where the merits of Cryo electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) are found. Cryo-EM was born with the pioneering work by Bob Glaeser and Kenneth Taylor at University of California, Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory [163]. It was not without need. Prior to their seminal work, pr oteins could not be exposed to an electron beam at high enough dose for visualization wit hout severe radiation damage [164, 165]. Negative staining techniques popularized by Horne et al. [166] circumvented this limitation, preserving structur al integrity and allowing the us e of higher doses. However, this failed to contain the crystalline order needed for atomic resolution [167]. Taylor and Glaeser showed not only that a frozen samp le had its crystalline order preserved to near atomic resolution but that freezing and low temperature microscopy allowed a sufficient electron dose per unit area to vis ualize the protein lattice [167]. No less appreciated were their innovative methods to overcome major obstacles unique to this burgeoning field, such as creating a thin aqueous sample for freezing, creating a device that would hold the sample and maintain a cryo state, acquiring a stage for the transfer of sample to this holder and ultimately, figuring out how to transfer it into the microscope without heating it up. The field of frozen hydrated specimen pr eparation and visualization was put on the map in 1984 by Adrian et al. in an arti cle titled, \"Cryo-electron Microscopy of viruses\" [168]. In it were stunning and beautiful images of the Adenovirus in a vitrified state. A vitrified frozen aqueous sample is ac hieved when a solution is frozen so quickly that water molecules do not have time to form hexagonal ice [169]. Since the virions and surrounding water molecules are frozen in place and imaged in situ, this preparation allowed visualizat ion of a near native-like st ate avoiding much of the damage to the structural integr ity of the specimen which oft en accompanied many of the techniques used heretofore, such as meta l shadowing, freeze drying, and negative staining. Undoubtedly, this work precipitated the appear ance of three dimensional reconstructions, that is, structures that are constructed from 2D images of the original 3D object in a vitrified state. The first few reconstructions were of a membrane protein by Unwin et al. in 1984, the icosahedral Semlik i Forest virus by Vogel et al. in 1986 and the asymmetric ribosome by Fr ank et al. in 1991 [170-172]. 24 Today, Cryo-EM has emerged a powerful we apon in the arsenal of structural biologist, especially for the analysis of large macromolecular assemblies. It is heralded for a capacity to obtain high resolution informa tion with objects of high order such as dihedral and icosahedral symmetry. Structures are now emerging at resolutions inferior to crystallography by merely an \u00c5ngstrom or two. In 2008, four cr yo-EM reconstructions were published with resolutions in the range of ~3.8\u00c5 - 4.5\u00c5 by a technique called single particle analysis (SPA) [173-176] . Prior to this, resolution in this range was obtained only from 2-D crystals or helic al filaments [177-180]. At th is level of detail one may not only detect and trace electron density corresponding to the backbone C chain of a polypeptide but visualize small spuds of density matching the location of protruding bulky side chains of amino acids of a fitted crystal structure. Mo reover, programs have been developed that design a denovo C backbone trace from EM density maps. In the cases where this has been performed there has been good correlation to known crystal structures [173, 175]. 2007 sa w the flexing of computation muscle with the automated data collection of over one quarte r million particles of the molecular chaperone, GroEL, in a single 25 hour session, subsequently refined to 8\u00c5 [181]. Perhaps a more important aspect of this research were the exemplar y automated procedures which pipelined this massive data set into reconstruction algorit hms for immediate processing, removing a significant portion of manual labor that is commonly found in data processing. This has laid a blueprint for future automation to follow. Cryo-EM is as versatile as it is powerfu l. At the specimen level there is no requirement beyond having the biological objec t immersed in a buffer of low scattering contrast, although specimens with small mass ( 500kDa) are difficult to image because of poor contrast [182]. Cryo-E M allows the analysis of spec imens in the form of ordered two-dimensional arrays or crystals, helical fi laments, as single par ticles with and without symmetry or as whole cell extracts. In a sim ilar way to the type of specimen that could be imaged, methodologies of imaging are diverse as well. Cellular st ructures that are pleiomorphic in shape such as the mitoc hondria and enveloped virus species can be studied by tomography. In this technique, a series of images are collected as the specimen is tilted at known ang ular increments. The images are then back projected to 25 reconstruct a 3D structure. Because no prior knowledge of the specimen is required this technique is amenable to many specimens. Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) pr ovides information which bridges light microscopy and crystallography and methodol ogies are developing to facilitate a stronger correlation. Recently a special st age for a fluorescent microscope has become commercially available [183, 184]. This stage allows a sample containing a fluorescent tag to be visualized under cryo conditions. In this process, a sample, perhaps a cell extract containing a tagged protein of interest, is vitrified on specia l grids that have X and Y coordinates pre-labeled. The sample is placed in the cryo stage under the fluorescent microscope and examined for fluor escence. Where there is signal, the X and Y coordinates are recorded. Due to the special light microscope stage preserving the cryo state of the EM sa mple, the sample may then be tr ansferred into an electron microscope for further analysis by locati ng the X and Y coordinates on the grid which gave the fluorescent signal. In total, Cryo-EM encompasses multiple techniques such as electron crystallography, tomography and single particl e analysis (SPA). It is well out of the scope of this thesis to discuss all in detail. Rather, the focus in t he following sections will be tailored to the technique of SPA which is relevant to the research presented. It will be presented in chronological order of the st eps taken from a pure sample and preparing frozen hydrated samples to data analysis and the inspection of the finished 3D map. Included in this process will be the technique of negative staining, which is performed prior to vitrification to inspect sample quality, transferring the frozen sample into the microscope, image formation theor y, and 3D reconstruction. 2.2 Specimen Preparation \"It is here where the ar t and science of Cryo-EM meet\" Van Heel et al. (2000) Preparing thin, frozen hydrated specimens is a finicky business. Most call it an art while many call it a crapshoot. Regardles s of its description, preparing samples for imaging is the most important aspect in acquiring quality data. It involves making a thin layer of sample and rapidly freezing it by plunging it into liquid ethane slush. The 26 freezing should be quick enough such that the rate of heat removal exceeds 104 oC/sec. At such a rate the motion of wate r molecules is arrested before nucleation and ice crystal formation occur. This is im portant for a number of reasons. First, hexagonal ice crystals have lower density t han amorphous ice and thus ordering water molecules may distort the spec imen's native structure. Sec ondly, hexagonal ice in the specimen produces strong diffraction effects in the imaging. Thirdl y, crystals in the aqueous solution contain pure water and their fo rmation is concomitant with displacing solutes from the crystal causing a localiz ed increase in solute concentration, which could perturb the local biochemistry [167, 169]. A number of factors play ro les in the vitrification process. They are listed in no particular order: user experience, blotting times and force applied to the filter paper, ambient temperature and humidity, the type of grid used, the volume of sample applied to the grid, bubbles in the sample, the type and shape of filter paper used for blotting, and blotting technique (i.e. whether one filter paper was used for blotting or two, one touching each side of the grid, A.K.A \"sandw ich technique\"). With such a number of variables in sample preparation, the cons istency between samples is poor. For the novice, it is difficult to figure out where to begin. Ultimately, if beginner's luck does not occur, thin layered sample preparation is an ex ercise in trial and error. Thus, one should be as consistent as possible and vary at most one variable at a time when refining blotting conditions. The degree of inconsis tency between sample preparations cannot be overstated. To this end, now commercially av ailable is a robotic vitrification device, the Vitrobot, with a controll ed environment chamber that the user can control [185]. This is discussed in greater detail below. 2.2.1 The Specimen Grid Cryo-EM samples are prepared on small, 3mm. disc-shaped copper grids (Fig 2.1). The grids are composed of a meshwork of bars which are used to support a thin layer of carbon. A variety of grid types are available that vary in mesh size (i.e. the number of bars) and may come pre-fabricated with a layer of carbon. \"holey-carbon\" grids have become the premier type for thos e wishing to pursue high resolution or automated image acquisition. Av ailable from Quantifoil and C-flat, these holey- 27 carbon grids come perforated with holes spaced at regular intervals [186]. This has advanced sample reproducibility and made po ssible automated image acquisition. 2.2.2 Freeze plunging The act of freezing occurs in a guillotine- like fashion. The device is appropriately called a guillotine (Fig. 2.2). Forceps holdi ng the grid sample are held a few inches above a cryogen that is used to vitrify the sa mples. Commonly, this cryogen is liquid ethane. The liquid ethane is contained in a li ttle cup that is surrounded by a dewar holding liquid nitrogen (LN) whic h keeps it in a liquid/solid state. Liquid ethane is used Figure 2.1: The holey carbon grid, low to high magn ification images. A) An image of a holey carbon grid next to a pencil for relative scaling. The grid is made up of a mesh of copper bars. The mesh size (number of squares) usually varies between 200 and 400 (B, representative image). Overlaid on top of the mesh is a thin carbon matrix containing regularly spaced holes. A close up of one of these squares is shown in C. In C is a vitrified sample prepared on a holey carbon grid with 2um hole size, spaced 2um apart. Different carbon matrices may be purchased, such as smaller or larger hole sizes and/or spacing. The white arrow points to a hole that contains no ice. The Black arrow points to a hole with a thin sheet of ice. The star is next to an area that has been imaged and shows signs of radiation damage. D) A close up of hole. Virus particles may be seen concentrated around the periphery of the hole and away from the center. This is typical of very thin vitrified samp les. When samples are thin enough, a meniscus forms 28 Figure 2.2: Freeze plunging with the gui llotine. An overview of the guilloti ne before (A) and after (B) freeze plunging. A) A solenoid acts as a lock and prevents the elastic bands from pulling the forceps downward and plunging the sample located at the end of forceps into a cryogen. Depressing a foot pedal (not pictured) activates the solenoid causing the abrupt plunging of the sample in to the cryogen. C) A top-view of the cryogen. In the center is the sample that is plunged into a small cup containing liquid ethane. Su rrounding the cup is liquid nitr ogen. Most of the ethane is frozen solid except for a small cavity in the center where th e sample is plunged. This ensures that the ethane is as cold as possible. 29 for the freezing because it has a larger heat capacity and a larger difference between its melting and boiling temperatures than nitr ogen. This allows large changes in temperature before boiling occurs. If the sample were plunged into LN, LN molecules immediately surrounding the grid would boil formi ng an insulating pocket of gas. This is the process of calefaction, in which a laye r of gas prevents thermal contact between two surfaces. This is similar to a water droplet on a very scalding hot iron skillet in which the lack of contact between the hot surfac e and the droplet prevents immediate Figure 2.3: A flow diagram highlighting sample preparation in the Vitrobot (F EI). A) The overall make up of the Vitrobot. The Vitrobot contains a computer screen a bove a controlled chamber (red square) and a loading platform (red rectangle below square). The platform contai ns a cryogen which is raised into the chamber. The computer screen displays various parameters used for sa mple preparation, such as humidity and temperature in the chamber as well as blotting times and force. B) A close up of the chamber (square in A). The chamber's atmosphere is regulated by temperature and humidity. In the middle of the chamber is a forcep holding a sample. Flanking the sample on each side are black pads with whit e filter papers attached to each. Below the forcep is a white trap door that is opened immediately before plungi ng. The sample is blotted with the pads (C) and plunged into the cryogen (D). E) Both the cryogen and forcep ar e lowered for removal. F) A close up of the sample plunged into the Liquid ethane. The blue circles are stor age boxes, which are submerged into liquid nitrogen. The grid is transferred into these boxes for long term storage. 30 evaporation. In our samp le preparation, the N 2 gas layer would slow the freezing process, in turn, allowing ice crystals to fo rm [169]. Attached to the device which holds the forceps are two elastic bands pulling do wn on it. Preventing the forceps from plunging into the liquid ethane is a solenoid whic h is controlled by a foot pedal. A small volume of liquid is applied to a grid which is being held by the forc eps. Excess sample is blotted with filter paper for a certain duration, the foot pedal is depressed and the elastic bands pull the grid into the liquid ethane. The grid is transferred to liquid nitrogen for long term storage. A new development in sample preparation is the Vitrobot or vitrification robot (Fig 2.3) [185]. The Vitrobot is a machine that provides improved consistency in the sample preparation stage by providing com puter regulation of key parameters that affect aqueous thin film formation of EM sp ecimens. Parameters that are regulated are temperature, humidity, and t he duration and force applied to the blotting paper. The grid is uploaded into the chamber which has tw o pads with filter paper on the inside. The grid is loaded between the pads. The samp le is either added through a small hole on the side of the chamber or out side the chamber before the grid is uploaded. Within the Vitrobot is a CPU which allows the programming of all variabl es involved with blotting. On the front side is a small scr een that allows the user to program variables for blotting. In addition to temperature and humidity, blotting duration and force may also be adjusted. The blotting duration and force are the respective length and applied force of the pads on the specimen grid. On ce the grid is blotted it is plunged through a trap door into a dewar containing liquid ethane. The grid and dewar are both lowered out of the chamber which allows the user to remove the grid from the ethane and transfer it into liquid nitrogen. 2.2.3 Cryo work station and cryo holders Before imaging, the first priority is transferring the grid from long term stor age into the microscope without heating up the specimen. This act is performed by a Gatan cryo-holder and workstation (Fig 2.4). The cryo holder is inserted into the workstati on and each are filled with liquid nitrogen. The grid is removed from long term storage and pl aced into the transfer area of the work station. Forceps for transferring the grid fr om the workstation and into the holder should be immersed in LN before use to prevent unw anted heat transfer to the specimen. With 31 the pre-chilled forceps the grid is moved into the tip of the holder and locked into place with a pre-chilled clamp. Once the clamp is in place, the holder is inserted into the microscope. The specimen is protected from fros t formation in the cryo-holder by a shield which when in place completely encloses the specimen. Insertion requires that the cyro-holder be rotated 90o which empties out most of the LN in the dewar. Once the cryo-holder is rotated back 90o the dewar must be immediately refilled. After the refilling of LN, the boiling of LN into N2 must be stopped. Otherwise this would cause the specimen to move too much during image acquisition. The boiling of LN is stopped by a small plastic tube with a r ubber stopper. It is inserted into the dewar such that the rubber stopper makes a seal on opening of the dewar. This reduces bubbling by increasing the pressure within the dewar and forcing the N 2 gas out of the dewar through a small rubber tubing. After this step, the LN should be very calm within the dewar, which can be verified by direct vis ualization. The removal of gas bubbles in the holder is a well-known and crucial step in reducing the amount of movement in the sample during image acquisition. 2.3 The Electron Microscope 2.3.1 Introduction The first microscope was constructed by Knoll & Ruska in 1931. A feat made possible by three seminal discoveries. 1) The discovery of the electron by J.J Figure 2.4: The Gatan 626 model cryo-holder and a transfer station. The holder contains a de war which is filled with liquid nitrogen to keep the rod tip (containing the grid) cold. The rod tip is inserted into the transfer area of a work station that is filled with liquid nitrogen (LN). The transfer area is where the physical loading of the grid takes place. 32 Thompson in 1897, 2) the determination of its wavelength properties by Louis de Broglie in 1927 and 3) the discovery that magnetic and electric fields can act as lenses to focus the electrons. The importance of this invention cannot be emphasized enough. It has allowed the visualization of life beyond the realm of light microscopy. The field of cellular architecture and components such as the mitochondrion and the structure of viruses, muscle, ribosomes could not be known without its invention. It has diverse application ranging from structure building to mere visualization of a biological sample. In many respects it is similar to a conventional light microscope. They both have a source which emits illuminating radiati on, lenses which focus the illumination, a specimen stage and a viewing source. The di fferences are numerous. Some of these are that the electron microsc ope is significantly larger, ha s better resolving power, and is operated under vacuum conditions. The follo wing section is a brief synopsis of the electron microscope, its workings and make up as well as image formation theory. Authoritative detailed descrip tions can be found by Reimer (1997), Spence (1988), and Frank (2006) [187-189]. 2.3.2 Electron gun Image formation in the electron microscope st arts with a source of electrons, the cathode (\"electron gun\"), emi tted at the top of a vacuum channel. The cathode is made up of a thin hair-shaped wire metal filamen t, usually tungsten or Lanthanum-hexaboride Figure 2.5: The FEI CM300 located in the Biological Science Imaging Resource at Florida State University 33 (LaB6). Electron emission from the cathode is with thermionic emission. Here, a current is applied to a thin metal filament and heat ed up to the point t hat electrons have enough kinetic energy to exit the wire. A potential is applied to the electrons, usually between 100kV and 300kV, which accelerates the electr ons to the anode. A field emission gun (FEG) is similar but has gained popularity over conventional thermionic emission cathodes because it can be focused more finely. In the FEG, a secondary voltage is applied (~2kV) near the cathode, lowering t he potential, and enhancing the emission of electrons from the source. Because more electrons are being emitted, the angular range that the electrons are exiting with may be restrict ed using apertures without significant loss of intensity [189]. 2.3.3 Condenser lenses. The beam of electrons exit the cathode, accelerated by a potential and are focused onto the specimen by electromagnetic lenses. Electron microscopes, like the FEI CM300 FEG in the Biological Scienc e Imaging Resource here at FSU, have a double condenser lens system. Each lens cons ists of a solenoid, a hollow cylindrical shaped object with metal wire wrapping around i t. Applying a current in the metal wire induces a magnetic field which forces electrons traveling off the central axis towards the center. In double condenser systems there are two condenser lenses. The first lens is situated near the cathode. It focuses the beam and demagnifies it. The electron beam continues to cross over and goes through a second condenser lens and aperture. Rays of electrons that hit the aperture are re moved effectively making a smaller opening angle of radiation. The second lens is used to control the illuminat ion on the specimen. Adjusting the current affects the focal length of the lens, which in turn affects the intensity of illuminat ion on the specimen. 2.3.4 Objective lens. A coherent beam of electrons stream out from the cathode and are focused onto the specimen by the condenser lens. The beam can be approximated as a plane wave front moving perpendicular to the plane of t he object. A portion of the electrons are scattered elastically by the s pecimen and undergo a phase shift of /2, which interferes with unscattered electrons. Ultimat ely, these electrons will produce phase contrast. A diffraction pattern occurs in the back focal plane. The objective lens focuses this 34 diffraction pattern into an image of the object. The objective lens is similar in construction to the condenser lenses but has a significantly shorter and less variable focal length usually in the range of 1-2 millim eters. The short focal length necessitates the specimen be immersed within the lens but a llows a large magnifica tion of the image. Electrons diffracting at too high of a radius from the optical axis are removed by an objective aperture located in the back focal plane above the objective lens. The removal of electrons by the aperture gives rise to amplitude contrast. Electrons scattered by the specimen wit hout depositing energy are said to be scattered elastically. These electrons do not degrade the specimen. Electrons scatter elastically off the screened nuc lear potential of the spec imen. The electron scattering cross section increases with atomic number but only at the rate of Z4/3 and is proportional to the projected c oulombic potential within the obj ect. This is approximated by the equation below. (r) = C(r,z)dz (1) Where (r) is the proj ected potential, r is a 2D vector encompassing the angular distribution in the x and y plane and C( r,z) is the Coulombic pot ential distribution. For biological samples made up of predominantly light atoms, C, H, O, and N, focusing the electron beam directly onto the specimen results in very littl e contrast in the image. Two methods to produce contrast in the image are with negative staini ng, which increases the amplitude contrast, and def ocus-dependent phase contrast. 2.3.4.1 Negative staining . The technique of negative st aining has become a popular and standard technique to visualize biological samples. Here, a solution containing a heavy metal, such as uranyl acetate is added to the sample. This blankets the object with a medium that scatters the electrons st rongly and to high an gles where they are removed by the objective aperture, produc ing amplitude contrast. Around the sample where the stain is thicker, more electrons scatter outside the objective aperture and fewer electrons reach the image in this area. Negative staining is popular for generating greater contrast since the heavy atom salt deposition not only generates high contrast but also acts as an excellent preservative. However, the use of heavy atom stains significantly limits the resolution that can be attained for two principal reasons. One, drying artifacts may distort the structure of the specimen and these will likely vary from 35 specimen to specimen. Secondly, the stain acts as a blanket and covers small structural features such as grooves, gaps , and fissures. The stain can only contrast what it can outline, so no internal structur es are visible. It is for t hese reasons that the use of negative staining is generally reserved for visualization and diagnostics in the sample preparation [190]. 2.3.4.2 Defocus depe ndent phase contrast. Visualization of biological objects without the use of heavy metals can be enhanced by defocus dependent phase contrast. That is, focusing beyond the specimen plane. This generates significantly greater contrast than could be visualized at zero defocus although generally less than can be generated with negative staining. However, the majo r advantage of this method of contrast enhancement is the avoidance of resolution- limiting artifacts associated with negative staining because the sample c an be imaged in its native state. Defocus dependent phase contrast is the principal source of contrast in vitrified images and high resolution microscopy. The scattering of electrons around the specimen gives rise to zones of high and lo w contrast. These zones are called Fresnel fringes and are the ha llmark of under focused images. Examples of defocus dependent Figure 2.6: Comparing two methods of enhancing image contrast, defocus-i nduced phase contrast and amplitude contrast by negative staining. Equal volumes of a virus sample were applied to grids, blotted, and either vitrified by freeze plunging (A and B) or stained with a solution of 1% uranly acetate (C). The excess sample was blotted off. A) A defocus pair of images collected at 1.59 and 3.5um under focus respective ly. The effect of the under focusing is contrast enhancement. In B, a faint white outline is se en around some particles. The white outline is a \"Fresnel fringe\", a hallmark of under focused images. In C, the contrast is reversed. The virus particles are now white because the uranyl acetate solution obscures electron pene tration giving rise to areas with greater electron scattering around each particle where the stain is thicker. In this image, the negatively stained sample shows enhanced contrast in comparison to A and B, despite being closer to focus. 36 phase contrast and negatively st ain induced amplitude contrast are shown in Figure 2.6. All images are of the Adeno-a ssociated virus-2. The partic les in panel A have less contrast and are more difficult to see than those in panel B, which was taken at a higher degree of under focus. In panel C, despite the image being ta ken at a defocus that is closer to zero than the image in panel A, the particles are significantly easier to see. The sample taken in panel C was negativ ely stained with 1% uranyl acetate. 2.3.5 Recording medium Recording the image is usually done with a charged couple device (CCD) or by photographic emulsion on film. Each br ings its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Photographic emulsions use si lver halide grains which interact with electrons after they have passed through t he sample. After the images are collected, the film is developed which conv erts areas of silver halide grains that have interacted with electrons into an opaque metal silver. Afte r development, the film is digitized with a scanner. In fortuitous situations where both ar e available, the decision of one over the other is debatable. An advantage of film is that it has no pr e-defined pixel size so the resolution limit is determined in the scanning st ep, which can be with as small as 5 um step sizes in some scanners. An obvious disadv antage of using film is the manual labor involved. The film must be loaded and unloaded, develope d and ultimately scanned. Film in general, takes substantial money and time. To this end, it takes days to merely obtain an idea about the qual ity of the imaging. CCD cameras are made out of an array of photosensitive diodes coupled to a scintillator. An electron im pacts the scintillator and is converted to photons which are transmitted to the array of diodes by fiber optic cables. The immediate digitization of images with the CCD allows the direct piping of data into processing stages. It is the immediate feedback of image acquisition which is the biggest advantage of CCD cameras. This has been exploited in high throughput, automated cryo-microscopy where the data is piped into im mediate processing steps [181]. A disadvantage in the use of CCD camera s is the predefined pixel size and smaller physical dimensions compared to film (2in.2 vs. 3.5in. x 4in., respectively). Thus, film can not only record larger images but may be scanned with finer steps. Images may 37 be collected on CCD with a pixel size compar able to a film scanner by acquiring images with a larger magnification. However, this reduces the area of view on the specimen level. In single particle anal ysis, this reduces the number of particles. In 2D crystallography, this reduces t he size of the 2D array. Both film and CCD cameras degrade the signal content in the image due to lateral and back scattering [191]. Lateral scatte ring occurs when an incident electron's trajectory is steered off cour se from collisions with atoms in the photographic emulsion (film) or scintillator (CCD). This causes secondary signals away from the incident trajectory and makes the electron's f ootprint larger. Back scattering occurs when electrons go through the recording medium, either film or sci ntillator, and bounce off supporting material or create secondary electr ons that do the same. In film this is usually the metal cassette that holds it. In CCD cameras, this bouncing occurs from the fiber optic cables. In both cases, the recordin g is not necessarily of the electron but of the path it takes. In the case of lateral or back scattering, the image of the electron or point is spread out over a certain area. The degree of scattering af fects the amount of signal corruption. The relative performance of the record ing material is expressed by two quantities, the Detective Quantum Efficien cy, (DQE) and the modulation transfer function or MTF [188]. DQ E measures the efficiency in detec tion. It is the square ratio of the signal going out to the signal coming in. T he MTF reveals the rate of decay in signal as a function of spatial frequen cy. It is the transform of the point spread function, which expresses how a single point source is r epresented in the image. A couple of methods to enhance the MTF involve removing the backi ng of film cassette holders and using a smaller accelerating voltage [191]. It has l ong been thought that only film could generate high resolution 3D data. Film is considered to be superior to CCD cameras at obtaining higher resolution informati on due to a better MTF. Regardless, both film and CCD images have been used to generate cryo-EM structures of superior qualit y. Out of the four near-a tomic resolution cryo-EM reconstructions in 2008, three were obtained from images recorded on film, the fourth on CCD [173, 174, 176, 192]. 38 2.4 Image Formation In cryo-EM, the final 3D reconstruction is a direct result fr om the acquisition and processing of two dimensiona l images. The higher the qualit y of these images positively correlates to higher quality 3D maps. Si nce these 2D images are formed by the microscope, knowledge of image formation in the microscope is important for proper use and correct 3D information. Image form ation in the microscope is a complex process. Detailed analysis of the physics of image formati on can be found in the books from J. Frank, J. Spence, and L. Reimer [187-189]. The fo llowing description serves as a brief overview of image formation in the microscope and is based on the theoretical development in J. Frank (2006) [189]. 2.4.1 The image The output image from a microscope is not a perfect repr esentation of the original object. The image is modified at vari ous points in the formation process. Three important areas are the elec tron-specimen interaction, m odifications from both the microscope, and the recording medium during the acquisition process. Contrast in the image comes from both phase and amplitude contrast due to electrons scattering elastically and inelastically respectively. Inel astic scattering results from a loss of energy in the electron which is deposited into the specimen. It typically scatters with a small angular range and forms background noise. Phase c ontrast arises from the interference between unscattered and elastically scattered el ectrons. The elastic scattering has a large angular distribution and generates hi gh-resolution information. This is a consequence of the wave-particle duality of electrons, electrons are particles which behave as waves. The incoming electrons may be approximated as a plane wave front with all electrons in phase. As indicated in equation one, the sca ttering potential of a plane wave traveling in the z-direction is proportional to the projected Coulombic potential, (r), of the object by (r) = C(r,z)dz (1) The plane wave before it interact s with the specimen is described by (r)= exp(ikz). It is affected by the coulombic potential in the spec imen to give the wave function as it exits the specimen: 39 (r)= o exp [i (r)] ( (r)= o (1+ i (r) -\u00bd (r)2 +...) (3) This equation describes the modification of the incoming plane wave into an unscattered wave ( o) and a scattered or phase shifted wave (i (r)). Higher order terms describe multiple scattering. If the por tion of the incoming wave that is scattered is small, (r) <<1, we can disregard the higher or der terms and approximate the wave as a scattered wave out of phase by 90o with an unscattered wave. This is the \"weak phase object approximation\". 2.4.1.1 Contrast Transfer Function. Since biological sample s have similar atomic compositions as the surrounding aqueous soluti on, the projected pot ential of the object is relatively low. The result is that in images collected at zero defocus there is very little contrast from scattered electrons. In light microscopy, phase contrast is produced by adding a phase plate in the back focal plane of the objective lens that shifts the scattered light by /2. Contrast then becomes linear wit h respect to the scattered wave function (which is small) rather than quadratic . This effect is generally known as Zernike phase contrast. In electron microscopy, the contra st may be enhanced by imaging with an underfocused beam. This applies an additional phase shift on the scattered electrons such that they are exactly in and out of phase with the unscattered wave and they now interfere with one another. This can be descr ibed as defocus-dependent phase contrast and it is the primary source of contrast in images of vitrified samples. How the sample is imaged is described by the Contrast Transfer Function (CTF), which modifies the wave function in the back focal plane by a phase shift. The CTF also adds a /2 phase shift to the scattered wave (actually +/- /2) just as the Zernike phas e plate. The CTF describes the effect of this phase shift as well as mi croscopic aberrations in the lens by an amount expressed by (k)=-2 (Cs3k4/4 - zk2/2) (4) 40 where (k) is the CTF, a function that encompa sses wave aberrations from defocusing, and spherical aberrations in the lens where k is the spatial frequency, is the wavelength of the electron, z is the amount of defocus, and C s is the spherical aberration coefficient. Spherical aberration results from electrons scattered at high angles not being focused at the correct pl ace in the image plane. This is because electrons further off the centra l axis of the beam feel the ma gnetic effects of the lens more than those closer to the center. This re sults in the focal length of the lens for electrons scattered at high angles being shor ter than for those focused at low angles. 2.4.1.2 The CTF contains bot h sine and cosine terms . The effect of amplitude contrast and the phase CTF, is commonly expressed one dimensionally as shown in figure 2.7. This figure shows the amplitude of the CTF as a function of spatial frequency. The function starts out at close to zero amplitude at the origin and oscillates between positive and negative values. The oscillation between positive and negative values means that the information will be transferred with opposite signs, which must be corrected for if the negative components are to be included in the image. At spatial frequencies where the CTF crosses zero amplitude, there will be no transfer of information. Information at spatial frequencies near the zeros will be transferred with little amplitude. Together, these effects represent the phase- contrast in the image. If there was only phase contrast and no amplitude contrast, the CTF would be sinusoidal and start off at zero. Figure 2.7: A theoretical CTF. T he CTF describes the effects of phase and amplitude contrast in the image. It describes the amplitude in the image as a function of spatial frequency. The CTF is a function that oscillates between positive and negative values. Some information will not be transferred due to the CTF crossing zero amplitude at some spatial fr equencies. The CTF is very close to a sinusoidal function due to defocus-induced phase contrast. Amplitude contrast in the image generates low scattering background noise. It is approximat ed as a cosine term that has a maximum at zero spatial frequency. Here, amplitude contrast has been approximated at 10%. The CTF encompasses both phase and amplitude contrast in the image and starts with non-zero amplitude. 41 The presence of some amplitude contrast in the image has an effect such that the CTF does not start out at zero. It is express ed as the cosine component of the CTF, which starts off with maximum amplitude at low spatial frequencies. Taking the phase and amplitude contrast com ponents into consideration, a more complete expression of the CTF, '(k), can be described as '(k)=(1-W)sin (k) + Wcos (k) (5) where W is the fractional contribu tion due to amplitude contrast and (k) is a function that was described in equation 5. This equation describes the relationship between amplitude and phase contrast. When there is no amplitude contrast and W=0, image formation process is purely phase contrast. In general, there is approximately 10% amplitude contrast in the images of ice embedded samples [189]. The wave function in the back focal plane bf describing the effects of lens aberrations and phase shift is the transform of the phase shifted exit wave behind the object multiplied by a term which encompasses lens aberrations. That is, bf (k) = {(r)} exp [i '(k)] (6) Here, indicates the Fourier transform, (r) is the exit wave function immediately behind object, and '(k) is defined in eq. 5. The objec tive lens forms the image of the diffracted image in the back focal plane by a Fourier inversion of equation 7. The wave function in the imaging plane is i (r)= - { { (r)} A(k) exp[i '(k)]} (7) where - is a symbol to denote a Fourier inversion, (r) is the exit wave function immediately behind the object, '(k) is the CTF, i (r) is the wave function in the image and A(k) is an additional term fo r the aperture function. The effect of the aperture function, A(k), is that electr ons that scatter outside the objective aperture are removed 42 from the image formation process, while thos e within contribute. A( k)=0 for the portion of the wave function in the back focal plane that is outside the radi us of the objective aperture, elsewhere it is 1. 2.4.1.3 Partial coherence. In the back focal plane with perfect coherence, the object's transform is multiplied by a CTF that has equally weighted spatial frequencies. In other words, as the CTF oscillates towards higher spatial frequencies between positive and negative values there is no diminution in the amplitude of the transfo rm of the exit wave. However, image formation in the microscope is not perfect and aberrations in image acquisition and formation process distort a tr ue representation. Two main contributors towards the degradation of beam coherence ar e a finite electron source size and chromatic aberration (energy spread). Chro matic aberration is from electrons with different energy or wavelengths which could arise from voltage fluctuations or energy loss to due inelastic scattering with the specim en. Electrons with different energy will be focused at different levels al ong the optical axis relative to the zero-loss electrons. The collaborative result of the finite source size and chromatic aberration is a partially coherent electron beam , which progressively deteri orates the signal to noise ratio with increasing spatial freque ncy. The effect of this is represented by an \"envelope\" function, E(k). The envelope function is a continuous function that deteriorates in amplitude towards higher spat ial frequency, characterizing t he partial coherence in the beam. The wave function in the image plan e taking this envelope function into consideration is: i (r)= - { { (r)} E(k)A(k) exp[i '(k)]} (8) which is identical to eq. 8 except for an ex tra multiplicative envelope term, E(k). The net effect is that the envelope function diminis hes the amplitude of the CTF in the high spatial frequency domain, sometimes called amplitude decay (Fig. 2.8B) [193]. This equation approximates the degradat ion of signal at high spatial frequency due to partial coherence in the illu mination system. In addition to partial coherence in the beam there is further signal degradation in the image recording process, Essentially t he recorder, either f ilm or CCD, contribute 43 to the envelope function, which is described by the MTF. This was discussed previously in section 2.3.5 The Recording Medium . The effect of the CTF and env elope functions in Fourier space is represented in real space by a point spread function. The point spread function describes how a single point in the object is imaged. The degradation of signal at high spatial frequency in the recorded image, I(r), can be expressed by convolution operation with h(r): symbol '\u00a4' denotes a convolut ion operation, I(r) is the image, (r) is the objects projected Coulomic potential, and h(r) is the point spread function, which is the transform of H(k) encompassing the CTF, aper ture function, and the envelope function. 2.4.2 3D Reconstruction Extracting three dimensional (3D) in formation from two dimensional images came to fruition in the late 60's by a group of scientist at the M edical Research Council (MRC) in Cambridge, United Kingdom. The basic principles of 3D reconstruction from Figure 2.8: Perfect and partial coherence. Two theoretical contrast transfer functions (CTFs) illustrating the effect of perfect (left) and partial (right) coherence. 1) A CTF from a beam with perfect coherence shows no amplitude decay towards higher resolution. However, aberrations in the microscope, specimen drift, noise, back and lateral scattering in the recording medium all contribute to partial coherence which down-weights information at high spatial frequency. In the im age formation process, these are weighted less than information at lower spatial frequency 44 2D projections of a micrograph were put fo rth by DeRosier and Klug in 1968 [194, 195]. The earliest applications involved icosahedral viruses, helical filaments and two dimensional arrays of a memb rane protein [194, 196, 197]. Today, the field of 3D electron microscopy (3DEM) is diverse in both biology and technique. It is well suited for macromolecular specimens particularly t hose with symmetry such as icosahedral viruses and filaments. Some cryo-EM fac ilities are now churning out three dimensional structures in as little as 7 days after receiving the sample (G. Lander personal communication). It is not wholly naive to th ink of these facilities as being similar to pharmacies where the scientist drops-off a sa mple (prescription) and picks up its 3D structure a week later. Undou btedly, the advent of electr onic data collection with the CCD camera, automated data collection, data storage availability and powerful data processing algorithms has greatly fac ilitated the field's computational need. 3D reconstruction is built upon the cent ral section theorem. The term \"central section\" means that the Fourier Transform of a plane must pass through the origin of Fourier space. The central se ction theorem states that the Fourier transform of a 2D projection from a 3D object density is a central 2D section in the objects 3D transform [195] : I(X,Y,Z)= object (x,y,z) exp(2 i(xX+yY+zZ))dxdydz (13) Where I(x,y) is the Fourier Tr ansform of the projection image and (x,y,z) is the objects density in x,y,z dimensions. The central secti on, Z=0, of the transform is given by (X,Y,0)= (x,y)exp(2 i(xX+yY))dxdy (14) Where (x,y)= '(x,y,z)dz (15) Here, (x,y) is the projection density parallel to the z axis. 2D projection images do, in fact, contain 3D information. They contain a plane of 3D information in Fourier space that is normal to the direction of view. T hus, if we have different projection images and we know their relative orientation with one another, its 3D transfo rm may be built by successively adding their central sections together in a plane by plane manner [198]. The inverse transform generates the real space reconstructed model. 45 The application of 3D reconstruction ext ends everywhere in biology, from purified particles to the entire breadth of the cell. An entire 3D reconstruction of the human body is commonly performed by Computed Axia l Tomography (CAT) scans. For some subcellular objects such as the ribosome and virus particles, which are present as identical copies, are perfect candidates fo r Cryo-EM because their orientations may be grouped and averaged to increase the SNR. This will be discussed in greater detail below. However, there are many objects that are not amenable to this sort of processing because they are too flexible, lending one ob ject to be different than the next. The mitochondrion is an example of this. Proce ssing of such specimens often involves iteratively tilting the objec t at known angular increments and acquiring images at very low doses. Because orientations of di fferent images are known they may be recombined, or reconstructed into a 3D object. There are many variations in the image acquisition and processing stages. This makes detailed descriptions an overly co mplex endeavor. The following describes a technique called single particle analysis as it is applied in the re construction of the Adeno-associated virus type 2. It describes , principally, the so ftware program EMAN, which is designed for the processing of single particle images [199]. 2.5 Single Particle analysis 2.5.1 Introduction Over the past decade a technique called single particle analysis (SPA) has become a very powerful technique for determi ning macromolecular structures in the field of Cryo-EM. Somewhat of a misnom er, SPA does not simply involve analyzing a single particle image but thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands of particle images. Here, a sample is embedded in vitreous ice and imaged in a transmission electron microscope. The parti cle images are treated as ident ical copies of a single object in different orientations. SPA is particularly amenable to macromolecular structures with symmetry. Since objects with symmetry are often constructed by repeating a single asymmetric subunit, an im age of an object with symmetry provides 46 multiple view of the asymme tric subunit. In the case of icosahedral viruses which have 60-fold symmetry, a single view (not down an axis of symmetry) will contain 60 asymmetric subunits in different orient ations. This field has reaped benefits from advancement in numerous areas of Cryo-EM, such as large array CCD collection, automated image acquisition, highly coher ent field emission guns, and computational algorithms. In 2008, 4 macrom olecular structures were published in the range of 3.8 - 5\u00c5 [173, 174, 176, 192]. For specimens with symmetry, Cryo-EM SPA is not only a very reasonable alternative to X-ray crystallography but should be considered in parallel or even in place thereof. 2.5.2 General overview of EMAN. Several software programs exist which a llow the 3D reconstruction of 2D images [200, 201]. One of which is EMAN (Elect ron Micrograph ANalysis) designed at the National Center for Macromolec ular Imaging at Baylor College of Medicine. A flow chart containing the processing steps which are performed in the 3D reconstruction is shown in figure 2.9. Briefly, particles are sele cted from digitized film or CCD images. These particles are classified into groups by aligning to references. Particles within a group are averaged and the groups are then transformed into their Fourier central section and inserted into its Fourier volume. The Fourie r volume is then reverse transformed into real space. New reference projections are made from this model, which are used for a 2nd round of classification. As before, the groups are averaged to make \"class averages\" and transformed into Fourier space. These st eps are iteratively performed until a final 3D map is produced. A brief descripti on of each of these steps follows. 2.5.3 Data collection a nd Particle selection. The object in an electron micrograph is a projection of the specimen in the viewing direction. In an ideal micrograph t he specimen is concentrated enough to have many particles in a field of view but not t oo concentrated to the ex tent that they are crowding and touching. Each particle image in the field of view is considered to be a projection of the same object but in di fferent orientations. Tens, hundreds and thousands of micrographs may be collected and digitized. The particles in each micrograph are cut out or \"box ed out\". In EMAN, this may be performed manually or automatically. BOXER, a graphical user interface (GUI) program allows the selection of 47 particles by displaying the image on the scre en and allowing the user to point and click to select each object. A semi-automatic proc edure is possible in BOXER as well. Here, a few particles are initially boxed out and are used as reference images. A cross- correlation search between these and the micrograph selects similar looking objects. If this noise level is low with little ice contam ination, this semi-automatic program works fairly well. However, the user invari ably has to verify and double check that misappropriate images were not boxed out, wh ich often occurs when small ice crystals are present. For micrographs with high noise levels or si mply acquired very close to focus, additional preliminary steps may be invoked. One method of locating particles in a micrograph is by collecting focal pairs with the first image collected close to focus and a second image with higher underfocusing. The fo cal pair method facilitates the particle selection process because of defocus-dependent phase contrast (section 2.4.1.1). The Figure 2.9: A flow chart generalizing the refinement process in EMAN. CTF parameters are determined in each image. Particles are first selected from images showing go od quality. The next step is initial model generation, followed by refinement. Refinement is an iterative process st arting with aligning particles to the initial model and building a new 3D model. A new set of reference projects are generated from this model which is used to refine the boxed out particles. 48 far from focus image may be used to initially lo cate the particles in the close to focus image. The particle locations in the far from focus image are saved in a database file and applied to the close to focus image. Another \"trick\" is to low pass filter the image to remove high frequency noise, which enhances the contrast in the image. The particle locations are defined and saved in a parameter file which is then used on the unfiltered image. (Fig 2.10) Figure 2.10: A Focal pair of images containing vitrified AAV-2 particles. The closer to focus image is on the left and the further from focus on the right. In row A, the par ticles haven't been selected for whereas in row B the virus particles have been. The enhanced contrast in the fu rther from focus image helps locate the particles in the closer to focus image. The arrow (right image in row B) points to ice contamination which is difficult to identify in the closer to focus image but easier in the further from focus. 49 For very large data sets EMAN provides a BATCHBOXER program which automatically boxes out images in batch rout ine without manual intervention. In a similar manner as the semi-automatic procedure outlined above, t he program automatically goes through a batch of images and performs a cross-correlation search between reference images and the micrographs. Howeve r, as before in the semi-automatic method, judicious selection of particles warrants the user to go over and correct the boxing program by deselecting incorrectly boxed out images. Once the particles have been selected in each micrograph they are ready for processing. 2.5.4 Correcting for the CTF and Envelope Projection images derived from the microscope are not true projections. During the image formation process they are altered by the Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) and envelope function. (For deta ils regard their derivation, please see section 2.4, Image formation.) When analyzing the data for correcti ng the CTF and Envelope function it is convenient to examine the averaged power spectrum of the images. The measured data can be expressed as: M(k)2 = F(k)2 C(k)2E(k)2 + N(k)2 (16) measured data, C(k) is the CTF, E(k) is the envelope function, and N(k) represents random noise. In the case of the CTF, the microscope enhances certain spatial frequencies at the expens e of others. Without correctin g for this, information at high spatial frequency is lost mainly due to the oscillating positiv e and negative phases of the CTF. Which spatial frequency is positive and negative depends highly on the defocus value with which the image was coll ected. Two different images taken at different defocus values will have zeros in the CTF at different positions, modulating spatial frequencies differently. This means in formation at a certain resolution will be transferred with positive values in one CTF and negative in the other. If left uncorrected, this results in the destructive interference in regions where the CTF oscillates between positive and negative phase. By correcting for the CTF, that is, locating the zero's in the CTF and reversing the sign of the negative phase such that all information has a positive value, significantly higher resolution may be achieved. The addition of multiple 50 images with different CTF curves also allows Fourier space to be filled up, since the CTF will cross zero amplitude at different s patial frequencies in different images. This type of CTF correction is called phase flipping. In order to correct for the CTF of each image various parameters must be determined. This is easily performed in Fourier Space with a rotationally averaged power spectrum with EMAN's program CTFIT (Fig. Figure 2.11: Determining the imaging parameters to correct for the Contrast Transfer Function (CTF). A) The power spectrum of the image shown in FIG. Superimposed is a 2D profile of the image's CTF (plotted in B) with inversion of the negative phases. The power spectrum indicates data quality. In coherent images, the spectrum shows concentric rings (Thon rings) which alter nate between zones of light and dark intensity. B) The 2D profile of the CTF curve (solid line) as a function of resolution. Towards higer resolution the CTF oscillates between positive and negative values. Also towards higher resolution, the amplitude diminshes. The dashed line corresponds to the effect of inverting the negative phases or \"phase flipping\". The positive values of the CTF and the inverted negative phases are show in white in figure A to highlight the locations of the Thon rings. C) A plot of various amplitude curves as a function of resolution. The dashed line is the background curve. The solid line is the theoretical CTF with negative phases fl ipped. The red line is the dat a curve or 2D profile of power spectrum. Arrowheads point to \"zeros\" or locations of zero intensity in the CTF (dark rings in the power spectrum). The zeros are where the intensity in the image changes value from positve to negative. 51 2.11). This program allows the fitting of both the theoretical C TF and data curve. In this manner, the numerous parameters involved in image formation, such as defocus value, amplitude contrast, and temperat ure factor may be fitted. After the various parameters have been determined there are a few ways one may correct for the CTF. The easiest way is to truncate or \"low pass\" filter information in the image at the location of the 1st zero of the CTF. This removes the oscillating information at high spatial frequencies beyo nd the first zero. In this method of correction, the highest resolution that may be attained is determined by the location of the first zero. Although high resolution informati on is lost, its advantage is in the fact that the SNR is greatly increased. A second way to CTF correct is to \"phase flip\", which was described above. Here, the zeros are loca ted in the CTF and the sign of negative phases are flipped so as to have a ll positive values in the CTF. However, if just the phases are fli pped, the projected im age is still not a true representation of the object bec ause of attenuations in the amplitude of the object's transform. Inherent aberrations in the micros cope, specimen drift, and noise in the image all contributed to an attenuation of the si gnal to noise ratio. The CTF not only has diminished amplitude at high s patial frequency but also near the zeros. The diminished amplitude in the CTF may be ca lled amplitude decay [193]. We now have come across a third way to correct for the CTF, amplitude correction. This is commonly called \"full\" C TF correction because it attempts to correct both the phase and amplitude of the CTF. A na\u00efve approach to enhance this decay would be to divide the objects transform by t he CTF. Where the signal is small, a large correction will be performed, vice-versa for high signal. However, the zeros disallow a simple division. A common way to perform amplitude corrections is to apply a Wiener filter to the data set. The Wiener filter is described as: W(k)=C(k)* C(k)2 +Rnoise(k) Robject(k) ( 17) Where C (k) is the CTF, \" * \" denotes the complex c onjugate, and R noise (k) and R object (k) are the power spectrums of t he noise and signal respectively . The effect of the Wiener 52 filter now depends on the noise to signal ratio term in the denominator, commonly described as a \"careful division\" of t he CTF. When the signa l is low, thus R noise (k) is large, W (k) is dominated by the R noise (k) /Robject (k) term and the Wei ner filter is a conservative multiplication by the C TF term. When the signa l is great the R noise(k) /Robject (k) term is irrelevant and the weiner filter is close to a division by the CTF. 2 .5.5 Classificat ion by projection In order to build up a three dimensiona l structure from it s two dimensional projections, the orientations of each projection must first be determined. This may be performed by aligning the images to multiple reference images of known orientation. This is called Multi Reference Alignment (MRA) or classification. All of the particles that get grouped by similarity to a reference are called a class. This is often the longest step in the data processing. Projections of known orientations (Euler angles) are generated from an initial model. Each particle undergoes a translational and rotational alignment process, after which each particle is associ ated with a particular reference projection. There are five parameters which must be determined: , the inclination of view from a 2- fold axis towards the 5-fold, , the azimuthal angle, which defines the angle between a line that extends up from the 2-fold axis of symmetry to the 3-fold, , the rotation of the projected view; and the x an y coordinates in the image. For particles with 532 symmetry, i.e. icosahedral particles, proj ections only need to be obtained through the asymmetric subunit afterwhich symmetry operations may be applied to generate 59 other sets of projections. An example of creating projections through the asymmetric subunit is given in figure 2.12. The use of reference projections for cla ssification necessitates the existence of an initial model for which reference projecti ons may be created. If the structure of the specimen is known, for example through X -ray crystallography, projections may be created by first converting the atomic coordina tes from a PDB file in to electron density. However, alternatives exist for specim ens of unknown structure. For icosahedral viruses, an initial model is generated by the program STARTICOS. This program searches through the data set for particles s howing the best 5-,3-, and 2-fold symmetry. Particles within each class are averaged and used to generated a preliminary 3D model. 53 Figure 2.12: A flow diagram characterizing multi-referenc e alignment. This is one of many ways to determining the orientation of particle images. It is shown here with data fr om the Adeno-associated virus type 2 but may similarly be applied to other macromolecules that differ in symmetry or lack any form thereof. In this diagram, 2D data collected on a microscope are aligned to reference projections. Refe rence projections are generated from an initial model. For icosahedral viruses with 60-fold symmetry (i.e. 60 asymme tric units) reference projections need only be created from one asymmetric subunit. This is because each asymmetric s ubunit is identical with every other asymmetric subunit. The asymmetric unit is defined as a triangle (grey, upper left) bounded by flanking 5-fold axes and a 3-fold axes of symmetry. Three angles, Euler angles, define how each as ymmetric subunit and projections created within are orientated with respect to the icosahedral particle. The asymmetric subunit is defined by the angles ,,, which define the inclination of view from a 2-fold ( ), the azimuthal angle spanning between adjacent 5-fold axes ( ) and the rotation in the viewing plane ( ). Once the reference projections are ge nerated the data set is aligned to the references and grouped into those with the greatest similarity. These groups are called class averages. Once a class average is created, the alig nment process is repeated with the average serving as the reference. Here, individual particles are aligned to the average to generate a new cl ass average. (* denotes new class average). After this iterative cycling, the class averages are inserted into a Fourier volume based on its known Euler angles. Applying icosahedral symmetry will generate the remaining planes in the Fourier volume. Inverse Fourier transforming generates the real space model. 54 The initial model will generally be quite noisy, resembli ng very little from the final structure (for example, see Fi g. 2.13). However, this is us ually sufficient to start the iterative refinement process. 2.5.6 Class averaging and 3D model building The number of projections required to sample Fourier space sufficiently depends on both the size of t he object and the desired reso lution. The minimum number of projections is estimated by : #projections =D d (18) where D is the objects diameter and d is the desired resolution [189]. After the classification scheme the particles in each class are averaged to create a \"class average\". During this procedur e, individual particles ar e aligned to the class average. A histogram is gener ated showing the similarity between the average and each aligned particle. Images represented by the tail of t he histogram are the least similar to the class average and, generally, not used in the class averaging. Similar looking particles are averaged to generate a new class average. After this initial class average is generated, each particle is alig ned to the class average and another histogram is generated. This process is iter ated several times until a self consistent class average is produced. The central section theorem (derived above) states that the Fourier transform of a 2D projection of a 3D object is a central section of the object's transform. Since the Euler angles have been assigned to the class av erages, the orientati on is known. Each class averages is transformed into Fourier space, slice by slice. By applying icosahedral symmetry to the class averages, 59 other sets of class averages are inverted into the Fourier volume. An inverse Fourier transform creates a three dimensional structure. (3D structures derived from elec tron microscopy are called \"maps \" to distinguish them from the term \"model\", often reserved for atomic coordinates. After a 3D reconstruction is created, new projections are made and the process is iterated until a self-sustain ing reconstruction is generated. After the reconstruction process has converged, the results are typica lly assessed by visual inspection and/or a Fourier Shell Correlation test (Section 2.5.7 below). If structural information about the 55 Figure 2.13: Evolution of two 3D reconstructions. This fi gure shows the evolution of re constructing 3DEM maps of AAV-2 in its native state and as a complex with primary receptor, HSPG. The figure is divided into 4 rows, of which the top two correspond to native AAV-2 and the botto m two of AAV-2 heparin. The native maps are labeled with a letter (A-F) which respectively show the progresses from a preliminary a map (A), to the final map (F). Similarly, the bottom two rows are labeled A'-F', which shows respectively the progression of a preliminary map towards the final (F') map. The preliminary maps (A and A') are identical, which were created with STARTICOS of the EMAN software package (section 2.5.5). The fi nal maps are described in greater detail in Chapter 4. 56 data is already known, comparisons may be made to better gauge how well the reconstruction is proceeding, after whic h additional data may be required and/or troubleshooting steps if erroneous features are visible. Fi gure 2.13 shows an example of how a 3D reconstruction converges from a low resolution preliminary reconstruction to a final reconstruction. 2.5.7 Refinement assessment After the 3D map is generated, the refinem ent loop is iterated over and over until convergence or a self sustaini ng 3D structure is created. The resolution of the 3D map is an indication of how well the refinement worked and is a good indicator of quality (Fig. 2.14). A common way to establish the resolu tion is with the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) [202]. Here, two 3D maps are created by splitting the original data set into even and odd halves, which are independently reconstr ucted. The resolution of the full data set map is estimated by comparing the cr oss-correlation between the two maps over shells in Fourier space as a function of spatial frequency (r), where the FSC is: FSC(r i)= \u00b7 \u00b7 (19) Here, F(r) is the complex structure factor at position r in Fourier space, the \"*\" denotes the complex conjugate and the summations are over all of Fourier space voxels \"r\" contained in the shell \"r i\". The correlation cutoff value to estimate the resolution is usually .5 is but lower values have been us ed [203]. However, despite the common use of the FSC, there is no uniformly accepted standard for resolution and other methods of estimation have been proposed [204-206]. Nevertheless, the proof is in the pudding. How well t he refinement worked or is working is almost always performed initially by di rect visual inspection. This is ultimately the strongest proof of m easure. If the 3D structure is kn own, the assessment is greatly facilitated by a side by side comparison. The 3D map is displayed at various density thresholds for inspection of the overall s hape, size, and structural elements such as motifs and secondary structures . The hallmark of sub-nanomet er resolution is that 3DEM maps should have secondary structures, -helices and -sheets that are identifiable. Density from -helices are often elong ated and cigar shaped (depending 57 on the number of turns in t he helix while Beta-sheets are c ontinuous and sheet-like. At resolutions approaching ~4-5 \u00c5 these featur es are further defined to an extent where the -helical pitch and -strands engenders regular variati ons of density. In the most detailed structures resolved by cryo-EM to date c.a 3.5\u00c5, small spuds of density correlating to bulky side chains can be readi ly identified emergi ng from the backbone strand [174, 176]. Other, more subjective measures of re solution may be specific towards the specimen itself. For example, parvoviruses have large loops which connect adjacent strands of a -sheet. These are often used as quality indicators for cryo-EM of paroviruses, which if visualized is suggesti ve resolution 207, 2.14: The Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC). The FSC provides an estimation of the correlation between two maps and is used to provide an estimate of resolution. Shown here are two FSC curves for the AAV-2 (solid line) and AAV-2- heparin (dashed line) reconstructions (chapter 4). The curves were generated by diving each data set into half data sets, even and odd data sets. Individual reconstructions were created from these half-data set and compared with one another. The resolution is estimated where the correlation between each map falls to .5. 58 CHAPTER 3 SEROTYPE-SPECIFIC DETECTION OF ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRUS DURING LABORATORY PREPARATION This chapter is the first of two which describes published research. This work was accepted in Journal of Virologica l Methods, 136 (2006) 277-282. This paper describes a rapid and reliable PCR-based method for the identification of AAV serotypes 2, 3B or 6 and screening for cros s contamination. The PCR assay is based on the use of differentially annealing, seroty pe-specific primer pai rs targeted to the hypervariable regions of the capsid codi ng region of the AAV genome. Identity is determined by the presence of a PCR product of size specific to each serotype. Multiplexing the reaction allows all serotypes to be queried in a single reaction tube and greatly diminishes the presence of false positives. The work performed on this project was equally contributed by two graduate students under the tutelage of Drs. Joan Hare and Michael Chapman. The contributions of the students were equal in volume and effo rt but focused at different stages during the evolution of the proj ect. In the project's early leve l of development, the role of first author was by Daniel A.J Mitchell. His contributions were aimed towards the functionality of the assay, incl uding much of the basic exper imental layout. This included designing primers based on the serotype-specific nucleotide sequence, establishing a protocol for extracting DNA from each vira l capsid and validating that the PCR assay could be used to amplify and detect serotype DNA. Indeed, by the time his role was transferred to me, not only had a version of the PCR assay been developed, it was shown to be functional in the amplificat ion of plasmid DNA of AAV2 (pAAV2). However, despite significant progress, the assay was still in a stage of infancy and needed much more work. Specifically, it required reaction parameters to be refined under which the correct primer set amplifie d its cognate DNA, while other primer sets had no activity. It is here where my personal contributions are made. Eventually, the assay was developed into a multi-plex assay and was successfully employed for serotype detection in various laboratory samples. 59 This chapter is laid out in a manner that describes the undertaking of each graduate student (co-first authors) separately. The first portion of this chapter entails a brief introduction to the assay as well as the various serotypes it is used for. (For a more detailed introduction to the biology of AAV-2, the reader is directed to chapter 1) Following this introduction, a section on material and methods encompassing all of the preliminary work performed by D aniel A.J. Mitchell is put fort h. Following this portion are my contributions which includes a results and discussion section. While much of this last section involves the analysis of assay resu lts directly for which I was responsible, it was the work of D. Mitchell, which la id the foundation of my contribution. 3.1 Introduction Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a small, icosahedral, single-stranded DNA virus from the Parvoviridae family, genus name Dependovirus [209]. AAV is dependent on either adenovirus or papillomavirus co-infecti on for its replication, but AAV itself is not associated with any known disease [210]. AAV has attracted much attention as a promising candidate vector for human gene therapy [211]. Wild-type AAV is found as multiple serotypes, infecting humans and other vertebrates. The number of sequence variants extracted from human tissue continues to grow (currently ~140) and these segregate into clades sharing serological properties [212]. Many of those found in human tissue have primary hosts that are thought to be non-human primates, but our studies focused on the three serotypes confirmed to infect primarily humans [213]. AAV-2 wa s the first of the serotypes to be cloned (Laughlin et al., 1983), facilitating production in vitro [214, 215]. Consequently, AAV-2 has been the model \"type species\" for biologic al and physical, studies [26]. Full DNA sequences for serotypes 1-8 ar e now available allowing molecular comparisons. Most but not all of the sequence variation are in capsid regions. Of mammalian serotypes, 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8 are about 80% identical in DNA sequence, while serotype 5 has a lower sequence homology to the others (~67% ident ity) [28, 216]. At 96% identity, AAV-6 is considered a variant of AAV-1 rather than a distinct serotype. The sequence variation between serotypes 1 through 4 is concentrated in four 60 hypervariable regions in the carboxyl-te rminal half of the large domain common to capsid proteins VP1, 2 and 3 [28]. When AAV- 7 and 8 are included in the comparison seven additional regions appear of <10 amino acids distributed throughout the unique portion of VP2 [217]. The most variable regions in the DNA or amino acid sequence can be mapped to exposed loops in the AAV-2 struct ure that are on the ca psid surface, as determined by the three-dimensional stru cture of AAV-2 at 3 \u00c5 resolution [218]. The structure also provided a basis for understandi ng the functional characterizations of the serotypes. In particular, t he immunological differences are likely largely due to sequence variation of the exposed loops that decorate the outer surf ace of the capsid near the icosahedral three-fo ld axes [150, 218, 219]. The viral serotypes functionally differ from each other not only in sensitivity of each to neutralizing antibodies, but also in tissue tropism and transduction efficiencies in target tissues (or host species) [ 220-223]. The continuing characterization of additional serotypes stems from hope for improvements in gene transfer therapy in terms of variety of cellular specificitie s and resistance to immune neutralization in patients previously exposed to the virus [120, 217, 224]. Serological studies indicate widespread human exposure to AAV-2 and to lesser extents serotypes 1 (6) and 3-8, even thoug h the primary host of some are non-human primates [152, 217]. Comparative studies of the human sero types, providing pot entially important structure-function insights, l ed our laboratory to the propag ation of large quantities of similar infectious viruses in vitro . This presents challenges of maintaining and verifying pure viral stocks. Should one of the vira l serotypes have a competitive growth advantage in the in vitro culture system, trace contam ination can quickly become a significant problem. An assay to verify the identity of samples was crucial. Absent a panel of antibodies that can discrimi nate adequately between all serotypes, PCR methods offer the best combination of tract ability and sensitivity needed to detect minor contaminants. PCR is commonly used to detec t presence of virus in biological and in clinical samples, to measur e viral levels following antivir al therapy, and to trace the spread or emergence of serotypes using c linical samples [212, 225, 226]. In gene 61 therapy trials, quantitative PCR (qPCR) has been used to quantify exact amounts of vectors to be introduced into patients [227]. Here, a simple single tube assay is described for use as a quality control standard in the setting of an AAV producti on laboratory for identifying human AAV serotypes 2, 3B or 6 within a mixture of genotypes. Because of the near identity of the primer sequences of 6 with the equivalent sequence in se rotype 1, the assay is expected to detect, but not differentiate se rotype 1 (from 6). By extension with the addition of primer sets, the assay could readily be extended to identify other serotypes of known sequence. The assay is also shown to be capable of detecting minor components of alternate serotypes at levels as low as 25 fg. The reaction is robust over a wide range of temper atures and conditions. 3.2 Materials and Methods 3.2.1 Virus production. HeLa cells were used as the host cell to support the growth and production of the adeno-associated viruses. All AAV serotypes were produced following the protocol of Xie et al. (2004) [190]. Briefl y, a primary inoculum was produced by transfection with a plasmid containing the AAV viral sequence and subsequent infection with adenovirus 2 as a helper virus. The plasmid pAV2 was a gift of K. Berns; plasmids pAAV-3B and pAAV-6 were gifts of David Russell. This primary inoculum is used to infect larger cultures from which the AAV is harvested and purified. 3.2.2 Viral DNA extraction Samples (1-5 l) were collected from purified virus stocks, media supernatants of infected cell cultures, or lysate s of cell pellets and diluted in 100 l of 1\u00d7TE with 0.05% NP40, and 0.05% Tween 20 with Proteinase 100 g/ml. The proteinase was heat inactivated before PCR. DNA concentrations following dilutions were verified using the Nanodrop ND 1000 spectrophotomet er down to the limit of the instruments detection of 1.5 ng/ l. 3.2.3 Designing the primers The sequence between nucleotide (nt) position 3534 and nt 4006 is highly 62 variable among serotypes. Nucleotide identit y among and between serotypes 2, 3B and 6 is 48% in this area (contrasting with ~80% i dentity overall) [28]. By targeting this area within the VP3 protein codi ng region, it was possible to design primers which could be predicted to anneal with high specific ity to a single serotype. The forward primers for each serotype were overlapped beginning near nt 3541 of AAV-2. Reverse primers were designed to anneal at vary ing distances from the common beginning within downstream variable regions. Varying t he position of the reverse primer for each serotype provided unique lengths for the PCR products. The AAV-2 specific primers yielded a 376 bp PCR product, the AAV-3B s pecfic primers gave a 444 bp product and the AAV-6 specific primers produced a 320 bp product (Fig. 3.1). Because AAV-1 shares a high degree of similarity with AAV-6, with only one mismatch in the middle of the primer, this assay would al so be expected to detect AAV-1. Figure 3.1: Viral sequences to which the primers we re targeted. Template sequences to which primers were targeted are underlined. Primers were targeted to regions of the genome with a high degree of diversity. Forward primers are centered on nucleoti de 3550 (AAV-2 numbering) in all three serotypes, an area designate \"variable domain\" 1 by Rutledge et al. (1998). Reverse primers for serotypes 6, 2 and 3B start at nucleotides 3867 (variable \"domain\" 3), 3917 and 3994 (both in variable \"domain\" 4), respectively. The primers are numbered according to serotype. Differ ential positioning of each reverse primer generates a PCR product of a unique size, as indicated above. Nu cleotides that are conserved in at least one of the other two serotypes are shaded. T herefore, unique sequence is indica ted by the absence of shading. A hyphen (-) indica tes a deletion. 63 3.3 My personal contribution I now describe my contributions on this re search project. Again, the goal of the assay is to determine the presence of a vi ral serotype in a sample by using the polymerase chain reaction. Double-strande d plasmid DNAs were used to establish conditions for standard PCR reactions. As described earlier in the PCR methodology, the exponential amplification of DNA in the reaction permits a high degree of false positives, which often arise from a primer binding weakly to a non-specific site. This assay is particularly prone to false positives since 3 different primer sets were used. 3.3.1 Standard PCR parameters When I joined this investigation the a ssay was functional towards amplifying pAAV2 DNA. However, a fa lse positive was continually being generated between this plasmid DNA and a primer set that was specific for a different seroty pe. The first task at hand was to optimize reaction conditions to e liminate false positives. There are many parameters one can adjust to alter non-specif ic binding. The two parameters often changed are the MgCl 2, concentration, and annealing temper ature. An example of how important the annealing tem perature is in this reaction is shown in figure 3.2. Here, two identical sets of reactions were put into tw o different thermal cyclers through 35 identical cycles: an initial denaturation step at 95 oC for 1 min., an annealing step at 68 oC for 1min., and an elongat ion step at 72 oC for 1 min. The intention here was to monitor, in duplicate, the activity of all three primer sets on pAAV2 DNA. Surprisingly, the results of the otherwise identical reactions turned out to be drastically different. It was discovered that a calibration error in one of the thermal cycler's annealing step caused the temperature to dip below what was set. The temperature fluctuated between 65 o and 68 o C instead of staying at 68 oC. The result of this was a lower thermal energy barrier between the primer s and DNA and the dete ction of additional bands. At the correct annealing tem perature, only the primer se t specific for the plasmid DNA was active. (Note: This particular therma l cycler was located in a different building and was not used frequently before this disco very. After this calibration error was discovered, the thermal cycler was not used any further). Each of the serotype plas mids were used in three separate reactions, one with each primer set. From these reactions, conditions were developed under which only the 64 correct primer set amplified the DNA, while other primer sets had no activity. The specicity and strength of the reaction was then optimized by adjusting annealing temperatures and concentrations of PCR reaction components The conditions for each primer set and cognate DNA were eventually finalized. The majority of the PCR parameters could be applied for all three primer sets. Ea ch were not sensitive to small change in MgCl 2, dNTP's or primer concentrations. Howe ver, the parameters for thermal cycling differed. This was principally due to the optimal annealing temperature which did not overlap between each serotype (68 oC, 64 oC and 61 oC for AAV2, 6, and 3B, respectively). The number of thermal cycles was 35 and the denaturation, annealing, and polymerization steps were of 1 min. duration. At this point, if one were to use this assay to verify the purity of a viral sa mple, three queries by PCR would need to be performed. 3.3.2 Multiplex PCR To increase efficiency, the standard PCR was supplanted by a multiplexed assay where all three primer sets were added into a reaction tube. Multiplexing requires that primers compete against alternat e primer sets for their ta rget DNA. The difference in Figure 3.2: The effect of different annea ling temperatures in the polymerase chain reaction assay. An assay was performed in duplicate under identical reagent and thermal cycling conditions but with two different thermal cyclers. The assay tested the activity of each primer set on pAAV2 DNA. The cycling involved a denaturation step at 95 o C for 1 min, an annealing step at 68 o C for 1min., and a polymerization step at 72 o C for 1 min. Above are two gels which show the results from each thermal cycler. The lane markers are identical for each gel. Lane \"M\" is a DNA ladder, Lane \"+\" is a positive control, and lanes \" 2' \" , \" 3' \", and \" 6' \" contain pAAV2 DNA and a primer set specific for pAAV2, pAAV3b and pAAV6 respectively. The left gel corresponds to the thermal cycler with the correct annealing temperature, 68 o C. Here, the only band detectable is in the lane \" 2' \". This lane contains primers specific for p AAV2. (Note, the posit ive control did not work because it has an optimal annealing temperature of 65 o C. When the annealing temperature is lowered a degree or two (right gel), additional bands develo p in the \"+\" and \" 6' \" lane. 65 Tms of the primers on t heir cognate template and on an alternate mismatched serotype differed by more than 10o (using Tm calculations that did not penalize mismatches). Surprisingly, the multip lexed reaction in which all three templates and all three primer sets were present was much more robust than the single standard reactions had been (Fig. 3.3). Eventually conditions were identified that allowed all three prim ers to bind its cognate DNA. These were de ned as 62 oC, 3 mM MgCl 2, 1 pmol of each primer, and 200 M of each dNTP. Taq polymerases used were from InVitrogen (2.5 units per reaction) or Epicentre Master Amp (1 unit per reaction). The three DNA/primer sets amplified equally well over a 5o temperature range, from 60o to 65o. Reaction times were shortened (reannealing steps to 45 s and extension steps to 1 min). The number of cycles was optimized at 25, a compromise between adequate intensity and the em ergence of non-speci c bands with excessive cycles (35 cycles\u2014 data not shown). An initia l denaturation cycle at 94 oC for 3 min., was followed by 25 cycles of 95 oC for 1 min., 62 oC for 45 s, and 72 oC for 1 min. The reaction was repeatable and was not sensitiv e to small changes in MgCl 2, dNTPs, or primer concentrations. When plasmid DNAs of the th ree serotypes were mixed and all three primer sets were added, three distinct bands of the predicted sizes could be seen (Fig. 3.3). When DNA from a single serotype was mi xed with all three pr imer sets, the assay detected only cognate plasmid DNA. Figure Multiplex reactions using plasmid DNA. containing the genomes of the three serotypes 2, 3B, and 6 were used to standardize the PCR assay. For each reaction all three primer pairs specific for each genotype were present. Lane1: A 50 bp marker (InVitroten), lanes 2-5 PCR reactions: lane 2: mixture of all 3 plasmids; lane 3: the AAV-2-plasmic alone (376 pb PCR product) lane 4: the AAV3B plasmid alone (444 bp PCR product); lane 5: the plasmid alone (320 pb PCR product). 66 3.3.3 Assay sensitivity To determine the level of sensitivity of our assay, we perfo rmed the multiplexed assay on 10-fold serial of the pl asmid DNAs of the three serotypes mixed in equal proportion. The assay continued to detect all three serotypes down to 25 fg of each DNA, or approximately 250 molecules in a 20 l reaction (Fig. 3.4A). Next, the discriminative capability was tested for one serotype in the presence of a larger excess of another serotype (Fig. 3.4B). The assay could detect 25 fg of AAV-2 or AAV-6 in the presence of 2.5 ng of AAV-3B. When the excess of one serotype is less extreme, contamination is even easier to detect. T hus, with 25 pg of one serotype (a typical aliquot used in our laboratory) 25 fg of the other serotypes are readily detected 3.3.4 Applying the assay on laboratory samples The laboratory had access to a collect ion of AAV samples prepared over a number of years. The majority were of AAV-2 at 375 bp indicating that only AAV-2 DNA was in the sample prepared when other seroty pes were not present in the laboratory, and were unlikely to be contaminated. More recent samples had been prepared when Figure 3.4: Sensitivity of multiplex used as templates in a serial dilution, then subjected to our standard multiplex PCR assay to determine the sensitivity. Lane 1 is a 50 base pair marker, lane 2 is a negative cont rol in which no DNA was added, lane 3 is the mixed plasmid at 2.5 ng each plas mid. Each subsequent lane is a 10-fold further dilution of the template DNA, such that lane 8 contains only 25 fg of each template DNA. Bands are detectable throug h all template dilutions. Note that as template amounts are decreased, unused primers become more visible at the bottom of the gel. Panel B: a similar assay in which the plasmid DNAs were mixed so that one DNA (pAAV3B) remained at 2.5 ng through all plasmid mixes, while the other two plasmids (pAV2 and pAAV6) were serially diluted. In lane 3, all three plasmids are pres ent at 2.5 ng. In lanes 4- 8 plasmids pAV2 and pAAV6 are serially diluted 10-fold with each lane. Thus, lane 4 contains 25 fg of pAV2 and pAAV6. The running time for the gel in panel B was longer than in panel A to better resolve bands of widely differing intensity. 67 AAV-2, and AAV-3B and AAV-6 were being inve stigated simultaneously, and therefore had greater possibility of c ontamination. AAV-6 preparat ion #10 was particularly suspicious because (on polyacr ylamide gel electrophoresis) a capsid proteolytic fragment that we had earlier as sociated specifically with AAV-2 (data not shown). These stocks were used to test w hether the assay could work as well with purified virus particles as it did with plasmid DNA. All of the AAV-2 preparations showed only a single band at 375 bp indicating that only AAV-2 DNA was in the sample (Fig. 3.5) . The assay also correctly identified stocks of AAV-3B and AAV-6. Notably, the assay revealed the presence of contaminating serotypes, in some recent preparations of AAV-3B and AAV-6, in addition to confirming the suspected contamination of AAV-6 pr eparation #10. Some preparations of AAV-6 were contaminated with AAV-2, while some preparations of AAV-3B were also contaminated with AAV-6. Consistent results were obtained on repetition of these assays. Figure 3.5: Assessment of viral prepar For each multiplexed assay r eaction, all three genotype-specific primer pairs were present. Lanes show reactions with template DNA drawn from different sources. Lanes 1-4 are plasmid DNA; lanes 6-17 are samples of AAV from different virus preparations (A-L), following lysis and Proteinase and #12 show cross contamination. 68 3.3.5 Determining the valid ity of false positives PCR assays are well known for produc ing additional ban ds under non-ideal reaction conditions. Indeed, befor e optimization of conditions , additional bands were not infrequent. Thus, it was necessary to eliminat e the possibility that the bands described above, indicating serotype contamination, were not false positives. Some of the AAV-3B preparations (abov e) showed both the expected band at 444 bp, and an additional band at 376 bp, whic h should be distinctive of AAV-2. We sequenced the PCR product of this sample wit h the AAV-2 primers [228]. The sequence matched the primer-targeted AAV-2 sequence [ 215]. Thus, the additional band was not a false positive, and the assay was correctly indicating that this sample contained a mixture of two serotypes. 3.3.6 Employing the assay to detect origins of source contamination The assay was also applied to the diagnos is of potential sources of serotype cross contamination. The multiplexed assa y identified two primar y stocks of AAV-3B and two of AAV-6 that had been cont aminated with a serotype 6 or 2. The assay verified that all other stocks were clean as well as host cell lines, serum, media and the helper virus (adenovirus) stocks used in AAV production, and made it possible for all subsequent preparations to be contaminant-free. With the assay's sensitivity of 25 fg, it was reasonable to rule these potentia l sources out of consideration. The multiplexed assay has also been applied to the near real-time monitoring of AAV preparations. The turn-around time is a few hours, so samples can be taken at appropriate steps in the viral production to veri fy continuing integrity of the preparation. The assay has been applied in this way to several recent AAV preparations, all but one of which were verified as contaminant-free. In the one case where a not yet identified contaminated stock had been used, the contam ination was identified quickly, and the preparation was abandoned before labo r-intensive purification. 69 3.4 Conclusions The multiplexed PCR assay is simple and robust. It operates well within a 5o annealing range and is not critically sensitiv e to small changes in other reaction conditions. Dependence only on widely availabl e instrumentation will allow widespread application. The short turn-around time and m odest cost of reagents, allow the assay to be applied repeatedly at multiple steps of an AAV preparation. This has already proved its worth in reducing losses from contaminated preparat ions, and in identifying and eliminating the origin s of contamination. However, even more important is the certification of the final vi ral product before structural or functional characterization, eliminating the possibility that the properties coul d be misappropriated between serotypes. The 25 fg sensitivity is sufficient to verify the effective purity for many laboratory investigations. The assay's discrimination between serotypes adds a valuable dimension to existing characterizations (protein gels, electron microscopy [190]) that are serotypes specific, such t hat it should become routine in large scale preparations. 70 CHAPTER 4 ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRUS-2 AND ITS PRIMARY CELLULAR RECEPTOR\u2014 CRYO-EM STRUCTURE OF A HEPARIN COMPLEX The following describes a cryo-EM study in wh ich I was first author. It was published in the journal, Virology (2009) 385 434-443. 4.1 Introduction 4.1.1 Brief history of AAV-2 Adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV-2) was rst discovered in tissues of children infected with adenovirus, from which its name is derived [25, 229, 230]. Since its discovery, AAV-2 has emerged as a leadi ng candidate vector for gene therapy. It was considered well-suited for development as a vector bec ause the wild-type virus is non-pathogenic, elicits a low immune ponse, integrates itself site-speci cally into chromosome 19, infects both dividing and n on-dividing cells and has wide cell tropism [114, 117-120, 122, 231, 232]. Recombinant ly engineered AAV vectors (rAAV) differ from wild-type in that transducti on is primarily episomal, and that the vector used is non- replicative and therefore not dependent on the presence of helper adenovirus [233, 234]. Experimental vectors have been designed to combat a variety of diseases such as AIDS, high blood pressure, cystic brosis, and Parkinson's di sease [124-128, 130, 131, 235]. However, AAV's promiscuous cell infection may also be considered a disadvantage and an obstacle towards the achievement of tailored cell-speci c vectors. Structural information regarding host-cell interactions could accelerate this development. 4.1.2 Structure AAV-2 is a dependovirus within the parvoviru s family and is the type species. It has an ~4.7 kb ssDNA genome encapsulated by a VP1, respec 236]. Common to all is the 533 residue component, co rresponding to VP3, which was seen in the crystal structure of AAV-2, determined to 3 \u00c5 [218]. It was t he infectious particles of 71 AAV-2 that were crystallized, containing the usual complem ent of VP1 and VP2, but the unique parts of these minor c apsid proteins were not observed in the structure which was averaged according to icosahedral symme try [190]. Relative to VP3, VP2 and VP1 are extended by 65 and 202 residues respectively at the N-terminus. The unique part of VP1, \"VP1u\" carries a phospholipas e domain that is important in transport of the viral genome from endosomes and/or into the nucl eus [41]. Two conventions for residue numbering are well-established in the literature, one counti ng from the N-terminus of VP2, the other from VP1 and differing by 137 (for AAV-2). Here, to minimize ambiguity, both will be provided in the form VP2/VP1. The common part of the VP1/2/3 subunit has a jelly-roll -barrel motif with long- loop insertions between the core -barrel strands. These intra-strand loops compose 60% of the structure and most of the distinctive surface topology. Loops from neighboring subunits interdigitate to form 3- fold related peaks as well as the putative receptor binding site found along the shoul der of each peak. These loops have a lower sequence identity (<15%) amongst different parvovirus genera and probably determine to a large extent tissue tropism [237]. AAV- 2's infection pathway is common to many viruses. 4.1.3 Infection On entering many types of ce lls, AAV-2 first binds a low af nity attachment (primary) receptor, heparan sulfate proteoglyc an (HSPG), to localize on the cell surface and then requires the presence of a coreceptor for endocytosis and infection [47]. Four co-receptors have been proposed to date for AAV-2 and its close relatives: broblast growth factor receptor (FGF hepatocyte growth receptor and integrins v1 been 238-240]. There are alte rnatives to AAV-2's HPSG-mediated cell entry, as revealed through tissue-dependent effects of mutation at heparin-binding motifs, poor correlation of infectivity wit h HSPG expression, and transduction by AAV vectors of low HSPG cells through -6, bind to sia lic acid with different speci cities for its various forms [243-245]. Thus, while cell entry is mo re complicated than once presumed, the 72 consensus is that HSPG-binding plays an im portant, often dominant, role for at least AAV-2 and AAV-3 [241]. HSPG is found on the surfac e of many cells. It is comprised of an integral membrane protein with an attached heparan sulfate (HS). HS, like heparin, is a linear polysaccharide of glucuronic/iduronic acid and glucosamine residues. The N-and O- linked sulfates of such heparinoids impart a negative charge which is implicated in their biological interactions with growth factors, chemokines, proteases, and pathogens [72]. HS differs from heparin in a higher diversity of disaccharides, lower levels of sulfonation and greater ubiquity, but heparin which is more speci c to mast cells is a close analog that is prepared for pharmaceutical use and is commonly used as a structural and functional analog [72]. Examples of viruses t hat use HS for cellular attachment include Foot and Mouth disease virus (FMDV), Herpes Simples Virus (HSV-1), human immunodeciency virus alphaviruses [72, 246-252]. Atomic structur es of Heparin-protein complexes have shown that interactions are often dominated by multiple ionic pairs between arginines and heparin's sulfate groups while polar inte ractions with sugar hydroxyls are also common [74-77, 84, 253]. Beyond this, there is little conservation of a binding motif between different HS-binding proteins so re cognition of binding sequences is dif cult [85]. In the report of the cryst al structure of FMDV subtype 01, complexed with heparin, it was suggested that a singl e heparin fragment could bri dge between multiple receptor sites on the symmetrical virus capsid [48]. It was proposed that weak binding interactions of individual sites could be combined to achieve strong binding in sum. The crystal structure of AAV-2, and calculation of the surface electrostatic potential suggested that the HS binding site might be a patch of strong positive charge on the shoulder of surface protrusions where 4 arginines and a lysine come together [42]. Subsequently, three independent mutagenesis studies tested this postulate, and all concluded that basic residues on the capsid surface were crucial for HSPG binding and cell infection [5, 49, 254]. There is consens us that a cluster of positively charged residues on the side of each 3-fold peak, speci cally R 448/585 , R451/588 and are involved in heparin binding. Unresolved i ssues include the lack of conservation of R451/588 and R 350/487 among heparin-binding serotypes, and differing experimental 73 characterizations of mutations at more conserved sites, including R 347/484 R350/487 and here are cryo-EM ons of AAV-2 with and without a 17 kDa receptor analog fragment at resolutions of 8.3 \u00c5 and 7.8 \u00c5 respectively. Difference map analysis shows the strongest peak as an elongated ellipsoidal shape laying tangential to capsid surface directly over the basic residues R 448/585 and R 451/588 and extending toward R 347/484 ,R350/487 and K 395/532 , in fact enclosing a footprint much larger than previously appreciated. At lower contour levels, difference density extends between 3- fold and also 2-fold related binding sites, indicating a single polysaccharide receptor bridges between multiple sites which together presumably achieve tighter attachment. 4.2 Materials and methods 4.2.1 Sample preparation Virus was propagated in HeLa cells, and puri ed by cesium chloride density gradient ultracentrifugation as previously de scribed [190]. Virus was dialyzed out of the 3 M CsCl salt and into a low salt bu ffer (125 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, and 1 mM MgCl 2 pH 7.5) using 50 l custom-built microdialysis cells. Quantifoil R2/1 grids were used to prepare vitried, thin layer samples. The grids were pre-coated with carbon, but an additional continuous carbon layer was appl ied to enhance contrast for particle identication and strengthen the Thon rings of t he power spectrum used to determine the appropriate contrast transfer function (CTF) correction. The grids were glow discharged immediately prior to sample application. For the native sample, 4 l of virus solution at 1.1 mg/ml was applie d to grids, blotted to remo ve and plunged into liquid ethane for vitri cation. Grids were transferred to liquid nitrogen for long term storage. Attempts to pre-inc ubate virus with heparin for as little as an hour, resulted in severe aggregation, even with10-fold molar exce ss of heparin relative to capsid protein (600-fold excess relative to virus particles). The aggreg ates, containing many virus particles crosslinked by heparin, were not suit able for the preparation of thin specimens needed for high resolution EM. Thus, samples were prepared using dilute AAV-2 that had been pre-adsorbed onto EM gr ids, such that heparin polymers were complexed 74 with individual viruses that were of xed location. Note that the procedure is different from the chemical xation used in other types of micr oscopy, in that the adsorption involves weak, non-speci c interactions that are neither expected to induce conformational distortions or to inhibit changes induced by ligands. However, the procedure will reduce slightly the occupancy of the receptor , because a handful of the 60 symmetry-equivalent binding sites will be o ccluded where the virus contacts the EM grid. Heparin was purchased from Sigma Aldr ich, Inc. (sodium sa lt, ~17 kDa fragment, catalog # H3393) and solubilized in di stilled water at 10 mg/ml. 4 l of virus at 1.1 mg/ml was added to the grid, as before. After blotting off excess, 4 l of receptor solution at 2.5 mg/ml was added to achieve a 10-fold molar exce ss relative to the capsid protein that had been applied. Thirty seconds later, the grids were again blotted and flash frozen. The grids were transferred to a pre-cooled Gatan cryotransfer holder and inserted into a Philips CM300 FEG electron microscope. Images were collected under low dose conditions (20e\u00af/\u00c52) at 300 kV onto a 4 k\u00d74 k CCD camera at a magni cation of 6.1\u00d7104, which corresponds to an effective pixel size of 2.45 \u00c5 and a Nyquist sampling limit of 4.9 \u00c5. 4.2.2 Data processing All 2-D and 3-D processing were perform ed with the EMAN software suite [199]. CTFIT was used to assess image quality. For this, each 4 k\u00d74 k pixel image was sampled with 512\u00d7512 pixel sized boxes fo r power spectrum analysis. Images with signs of drift or astigmatism were excluded. Particles within a defocus range of 0.8 to 3.8 m were selected automatically with the AUTOBOX option in the BOXER program, and manually checked for the presence of ic e crystals, broken par ticles, or debris. The renement of parameters describing the orientation of virus particles projected in the 2-D EM images (projecti on alignment) requires a starting 3-D map. Convergence might have been quicker had the starting map been simulated from the known crystal structure. However, to avoid bias, the initial map was built de novo from the EM images, assuming only that they contained icosahedral symmetry. In the STARTICOS program of EMAN, the data are searched fo r particles with approximate 5- , 3-, or 2-fold symmetry (in projection), i ndicating that the symmetry axis in the 3-D particles was approximately paralle l to the projection direction. Particles exhibiting each 75 of the symmetries were aligned and grouped in to class averages. A 3-D map can then be constructed using the known angular re lations of the icosahedral symmetry axes. Initial reconstructions were performed with low pass ltered (20 \u00c5) images and re ned until features of the virus began to emerge. To increase the resolution, data were corrected for the CTF and the re nement was continued. Particles were clustered into 179 classes, each corresponding to a differ ent projection direction within the asymmetric unit. Each cycle of 3-D particle rec onstruction involved 3 rounds of iterative 2-D class averaging. Individual particle images were excluded if their correlation differed by more than 0.8 standard errors from the mean. 68% and 70% of the total native and complex particles respective ly were included in the nal renement. To further remove reference bias and to be sure that features in the map of the co mplex were real, the nal 3-D map was reconstructed using 2-D pr ojection images whose orientations were rened with reference to the native map. The resolution was assessed by Fourier Shell Correlation between even and odd m aps with a cutoff of 0.5. Complex minus native difference maps were calculated using the \"DR DIFF\" procedure of the SPIDER program [200]. In this procedure t he maps are scaled to least- squares minimize their discrepancy within an opt ionally masked region. Prior to scaling, each map was low-pass ltered to the same 8.3 \u00c5 resolution as the complexed particles. For scaling complex to native, t he mask was a spherical shell between 79 and 125 \u00c5, thereby including most of the capsid protein, but excludin g the primary heparin site which began about 127 \u00c5 from the center (and the 3-fo ld capsid spikes). For difference map calculation, all maps were brought to a common scal e \u2014 that of the low- pass ltered native map, so that a single estimate of the experimental noise could be used. 4.2.3 Data Analysis The signicance of features in the maps, relative to noise, was assessed through analysis of a \"mock\" difference map, calcul ated between the native odd and even image half-data sets. Each data set was low-pass ltered to 8.3 \u00c5, processed as described above and scaled to the corresponding full- data native map before calculating the differences as a measure of error. The histogram of voxels between 79 and 160 \u00c5 from the virus center (including all of the capsid protein) yielded a standard deviation that 76 should correspond to the random error of di fference maps and approximately sqrt(2) times the error of separate native and comp lex maps. In the discussion contours are described in estimated error units (e.u.) ra ther than standard deviation or sigma. The latter are often cited in this context, but us ually refer to the variance of the density which is a measure of both real signal in a m ap and noise. Note also that the noise is estimated only from regions containing viru s and is and is therefore not lowered by inclusion of solvent regions. Density was compared to the atomic stru cture of AAV-2 (RCSB entry 1LP3) [42] using the molecular graphics program CHI MERA (Pettersen et al., 2004), after expanding the icosahedr al symmetry. The electrostatic surface potential was calculated by the Poisson-Boltzmann equati on using the program APBS [ 255] with the structure of the entire capsid, and assuming a sali ne like solvent at 0.15 M salt. 4.3 Results and discussion 4.3.1 Quality of the electron microscopic reconstructions AAV-2 complexed with a 17 kDa receptor analog fragment, together with a native control, has been visualized through cryo-E M reconstruction (Figs. 4.1A, C) at resolutions of 8.3 \u00c5 and 7.8 \u00c5 respectively (Fig. 4.2) that are among the highest that have been obtained for any parvoviru s [256]. The reconstruction of the native virus was built from 7491 particle images. The agreement between the EM reconstr uction of the native virus and the crystallographic structure is excellent, even though perfect agreement should not be expected at 8 \u00c5 resolution. All surface f eatures characteristic of AAV-2 are apparent, including conspicuous 3-fold related peaks, a 2-fold dimple and an empty 5-fold channel. The overall consistency is remarkably good, and improved relative to the earlier EM visualizations of AAV-2 particles at ca. 10 \u00c5 resolution [40]. Several hairpin loops, comprised of just two antiparallel backbone chains are clearly visible on the surface, such as the DE loop between -strands D and E, ve symmetry-equivalent copies of which form distinctive outer surfac e features surrounding the 5-fold axis (Fig. 4.2). 77 Figure 4.1 : 3-D electron microscope reconstructions of native (A, C) and AAV-2-heparin (B, D) at 7.8 and 8.3 \u00c5 resolution respectively. Panels A and B show stereo pairs of the outer surface, while C and D show cut-aways to reveal the inner surface, all viewed in the same orientation down a 2-fold axis of symmetry. Maps were spherically masked (at 80 and 160 \u00c5) for clarity. (Note t hat while the particles imaged contained DNA, generally it was not seen above noise levels at these resolutions , because its structure was disordered.) In panels A and B, maps are colored according to distance from the cent er (from green to yellow to brown). The arrow in panel B points to the general vicinity of the bound receptor. At this contour level (4.4 e. u.), relative to the native particle in panel A, density is added to the lower surface of t he 3-fold peak, and connecting density can be seen extending to a neighboring peak. In panels C and D, coloring is by strength of the density, from weakest (2.5 e.u., red) to strongest (25 e.u., blue). Some of the icosahedral symmet ry axes are annotated in panel D. The differences between the complexed (D) and native (C) are subtle, and will be best visualized in difference maps in later gures. However, the map of the comp lex has extra density between the 3-fo ld proximal surface peaks. The point to be emphasized from panels C a nd D are that the additi on of the heparin makes little difference to the capsid protein structure. 78 Interpretation was restricted to map featur es exceeding 3 or 4 error units. This threshold appears to be robust from several perspectives: (1) the mock difference map (odd-even images) gives highest peaks in general positions of \u00b13 e.u. (noting that symmetry axes can have higher noise). (2) The native EM map, contoured at 3.8 e.u. gives good correspondence to the crystallo graphic structure \u2014 at 4.4 e.u. some parts are outside the density, while at 1.8 e. u. all is enclosed within a possibly over- generous envelope. (3) If a single 17 kDa fragment were bound at each of 60 symmetrical sites, the appropriate volume would be enclosed by an isocontour at 2.5 e.u., 4.5 e.u. if each heparin bridges between two binding si tes. Thus, three different criteria suggest that the transit ion from noise to real features occurs between +2.5 and +4.5 e.u. Figure 4.2: Assessment of map quality. (A) Fourier shel l correlation (FSC) comparing the signal from two halves of the image set as a function of resolution. The correlation for the virus alone is shown in solid line and that of the heparin complex das hed. Resolutions are estimated from the points at which the correlation coef cients drop below 0.5. (B) Example region of the 7.8 \u00c5 resolution native reconstruction rendered at 8 e.u and overlaid on the crystallographic structure. The view is inwards, parallel to a 5-fold axis, around which 3 copies of the HI loop can be seen on the right, with two copies of the DE loop (top left and bottom). The reconstruction allows features of the virus to be resolved at the level of surface 79 The reconstruction of the HS-complex was built from 5950 individual virion images (Figs. 4.1B, D). Overall, t here is a good agreem ent with the native reconstruction. Extra density in the map of the complex co vers the entire 3-fold area. The differences between heparin-complex and native are most apparent in the difference map which is interpreted below, but all of the signi cant features could also be seen in the map of t he complex (Fig. 4.1). 4.3.2 Visualization of the bound heparin receptor analog In the heparin-native difference map, the st rongest density at +6.9 e.u. is located just off the viral surface near a concentra tion of 6 positively charged residues. The closest is R 448/585 , about 5 \u00c5 away from the highest de nsity (Table 1 and Figs. 4.3 and 4.4). Strong density >+6 e.u. wraps around neighboring side chains, R 448/585 and R 451/588 (Table 1), which are on the inner shoulder of each peak surrounding the 3-fold axes. Density at +5.2 e.u extends from each of the shoulders, connecting over and around the 3-fold axes, bridging the 28 \u00c5 wide valley between 3-fold related peak shoulders. If the contour level is dropped to +3 e.u., the ent ire valley between 3-fold peaks is filled in, from the bottom (120 \u00c5 from the virus center) on the 3-fold to a surface at 150 \u00c5 from the virus center. The entire 3-fold side of eac h of the peaks is covered, except for the most exposed residues, P 314/451 - T 319/456 , that protrude 10 \u00c5 above the heparin at the distal end of the peak, 160 \u00c5 from the virus center. The three peaks surrounding each 3-fold axis thereby become interconnected with heparin density. Connections between different 3-fold regions are also present, ex tending over the 2-fold axes, but at a lower density level (+2.5 e.u.) where th e significance is borderline. A crude estimate of the heparin occ upancy was obtained by comparing the highest peaks in the complex map in t he heparin and capsid protein regions. The heparin density is about 1/3 of the height providing an estimate of the heparin occupancy that is a lower bound to the degree t hat the heparin is more disordered and of weaker density than the capsid protein. The fragment size used in this study is 17 kDa or 70 monosaccharide units. It was larger than the oligosaccharides used in prior preliminary experiments, and not only easier to visualize by EM, but it better represents physiological interactions. However, with a long polymer, the heparin likely exists as a population of many possible c onfigurations. Its density will be smeared where different 80 Figure 4.3 : Differences between cryo-EM reconstructions of the heparin-complex and native AAV-2. (A) Superimposed on the EM reconstruction of the native part icle (gray translucent su rface) are the positive (red) and negative (green) regions of the difference map. The icosahedral symmetry axes are shown with arrows (the view is down a 5-fold) and the surface is divided into 60 equivalent triangular areas. The strongest positive difference densities surrounds each 3- fold axes, rising to 6.9 e.u. Contouring of the difference density at \u00b14 e.u. (translu cent) and \u00b15 e.u. (solid surface) shows that these peaks are the most massive. (B) The difference density is shown in a cross-section with a 5-fold axis vertical. Five symmetry - related capsid proteins are shown in C trace. Positive density is red, negative is blue, both contoured at \u00b13, \u00b14, and \u00b15 e.u. The strongest negative peaks (~-6.0 e.u) are on the inner capsid surface, 83 \u00c5 from the virus center at the boundary between protein and DNA. (Continued on next page.) 81 polysaccharide conformations are averaged by the icosahedral symmetry applied in 3-D reconstruction. How long is the heparin polymer? Extrapol ating from the st ructure of the fragment bound in the crystallographic study of FMDV, the 17 kDa fragment used here could be as long as 285 \u00c5. In an extended c onfiguration this corresp onds to 1/3 of the virus circumference. There may be many ways of winding between 3-fold peaks and connecting between adjacent capsid binding sites. 60-fold averaging over the different configurations will lead to diffuse heparin density. Furthermore, some paths of the polymer will be mutually exclusive. Thus, once two neighboring sites have been connected directly over the 3-fold, the same bi nding configuration is not available for the third equivalent site. In summary, an o ccupancy of less than one represents a combination of steric exclusi on, the averaging of statically disordered conformations and dynamic flexibility of the polymer chain, a ll of which lower the heparin density and make it more diffuse. Each of the 3-fold symmetric parts of the heparin density can be modeled with a nonasaccharide. The sample heterogeneity and structural disorder discussed above, together with the modest resolution mean that the density lacks the di stinctive features required to discern polysaccharide sequence, chain direction or exact conformation. Thus, only a crude model was warranted, built by connecting rigidly t monosaccharide The next strongest negative density forms a ring of peaks at 3 to 4 e.u. surrounding each 5-fold axis. These are comparable with the experimental noise level of ~3 e.u. (see text) and lie 11 \u00c5 from the viral surface. The strong positive density at the top left and right are the 3-fold proximal heparin peaks described in panel A. The next strongest positive peaks are on the 5-fold axes of symmetry where noise levels are expected to be 2.2\u00d7 that of general positions, so these peaks are not experimentally signi cant. (C) Sections through the cryo-EM reconstructions ~2.45 \u00c5 from a plane containing multiple 2-, 3-and 5-fold axes, some of which are annotated. The grey-scale runs from dark ( negative density) to white (positive). The green arrows point to the region where negative peaks ( 3 to 4 e.u.) surround the 5-fold axis . At this location, 11 \u00c5 from the viral surface, the density in both native and comple x is negative, suggestive of experimental error or solvent differences. By contrast, the stronger density, highlighted with a red arrow in panels A and C, is clearly more positive than that in the native and is the site where heparin binds. (D) Stereoscopic image of the most prominent difference peak. The view is similar to the boxed region in panel A, with a 3-fold axis rotated ~17\u00b0 clockwise from vertical and ~32\u00b0 forwards. The surface shows the cryo-EM reconstruction of the native virus contoured at 3.1 e. u. and colored according to the elec trostatic potential of the underlying crystallographic structure (ball-and-stick, green ca rbons). The red net shows the EM difference density contoured at +4.7 e.u., with the strongest regions ( ~6.5 e.u.) highlighted using ma genta spheres. The density lls most of the valley between spikes from the bottom of the valley at 120 \u00c5 to a \"height\" from the viral center of ~150 \u00c5, leaving the most distal residues of the viral surface expo sed. Note that the strongest density of the heparin (which carries negatively charge d sulfates) lies above a par t of the valley that is 82 units from RSCB entry 1SR5 using the progr am Coot [257]. Two of the three symmetry equivalent 9-mers can be connected through each 3-fold (Fig. 4.4B), so the density may represent the average of po ssible paths of 18 of the 70 monosaccharide units in each sample molecule. Such a con guration allows the observable part of each heparin to wind through the strongest difference density t hat is on the positively charged sides of two 3-fold proximal peaks (Fig. 4.3D and Fig. 4.4A). It is the regions where the heparin is mostly tightly bound that give the strongest density. The rest of the heparin is too disordered to visualize, but there are hints with density at about noise level, that the chains can also bridge between the 3- fold regions over the 2-fold axes. 4.3.3 Search for possible receptor- induced conformational changes The difference map has been examined syst ematically for evidence of heparin- induced conformational change in the capsid (Fig. 4.3). Protein conformational change should be apparent with adjacent negative and positive density in the difference map indicating the unbound and bound con gurations. The most negative difference density Table 4.1 Basic amino acids proximal to the highest sub-peaks in the heparin-native difference map Coordinates are given in a 222a reference frame in which icosahedral 2-folds are aligned with the principal axes. Chain \"G\" is a 3-fold equivalent of protomer \"A\". Distances are measured to the point of maximal density, and do not account for the size of a bound heparin molecule. If the contour level were dropped to 3.eu., all tabulated residues would contact the diffe rence density envelope that would encompass all the three sub-peaks. Distances are given in parentheses if access to the density peak would be occluded by another chain 83 Figure 4.4: Molecular interpretation of EM results (s tereoscopic images). (A) The interactions of the viral protein with the heparin are best illustrated by looking outwards from inside one of the peaks surrounding a 3-fold (left arrow). In this stereo diagram, the cut- away translucent surface is the experimental cryo-EM reconstruction of native, AAV-2 contoured at 3.1 e.u. and colored according to the electrostatic potential from r ed (most negative) to blue (most positive). (Continued on next page) 84 is on the inside surface of the capsid where there are several peaks of ~ 6 e.u. all ~83 \u00c5 from the virus center. Bo th complex and native maps have strong negative peaks, up to ~ 20 e.u. that are about 2/3 of the strength of the maximal capsid protein positive density. The spherical shape of capsids can lead to superposit ion of truncation ripples and to larger-than-usual series termination e ffects on the inside of the capsid. These peaks correspond to modest differences between densities that are strongly negative in both complex and native, and t herefore do not represent c onformational change. The only other negative feature ( 4.0 e.u.) in the difference map commensurate with the estimated noise is also in a location that is negative in both complex and native (Fig. 4.3C). It also sits 11 \u00c5 off the surf ace beyond molecular rationalization. The positive peaks in the difference m ap can similarly be analyzed. After the peak near residues R 448/585 and R 451/588 , there is difference densit y on the 5-fold that is almost as strong, ~108 \u00c5 from the virus center. The lling of the 5-fold pore, 21 \u00c5 wide at this point would be intriguing, but t he expected noise on a 5-fo ld axis is sqrt(5)- fold higher, so this feature is not experimentally signi cant. The next strongest peak (3.5 e.u.) is at the noise level in a surface pocket between K 528/665 and C 224/361 . The map of The potential was calculated from the crystallographic structure (ball and-stick). Behind the translucent surface can be seen a chicken-wire representation of the difference cryo-EM density for the heparin, contoured at a high level (5.7 e.u.) and with its st rongest regions highlighted by magenta spheres. The heparin density coincides with a positively charged surfac e (blue strip running lower right to upper left) that is formed by the positively charged amine and guanidinium groups (blue nitrogens) of K 390/527 and R 350/487 from subunit A, with R 448/585 and R 451/588 from neighboring subunit G which together with R 347/484 of subunit A, also in the vicinity, have been implicated in heparin-bind ing through structure-inspired mutagenesis (Kern et al., 2003; Opie et al., 2003; Xie et al., 2002). (B) The diffe rence density, contoured in red at 4.9 e.u. is commensurate in size with 3 \u00d7 9-mer saccharides, mode led in cyan ball-and-stick, surrounding a 3-fold axis (central arrow). (Heparin is a heterogenous mixture \u2014 t he model is not intended to represent accurately any one of the conformations averaged in the reconstructi on, but only its dimensions .) The green translucent surface shows the cryo-EM reconstructi on of native AAV-2 at 7.8 \u00c5 resoluti on, contoured at 6. 7 e.u. overlaid on the 3 \u00c5 crystal structure (Xie et al., 2002). (C) T he heparin density, contoured at 4.7 e.u., is overlaid on the atomic structure which is color ed according to atomic properties and to highlight amino acids subject to relevant mutational studies. Side chains are colored wi th positively changed atoms blue, negatively charged atoms red and uncharged polar atoms pink. Carbons are colored by mutation phenotype, combining the results of three studies (Kern et al., 2003; Lochrie et al., 2006; Opie et al., 2003). In green are colored residues affecting heparin interactions in any of the studies, darkly shaded for the strongest effects. Residues that did not appear to affect heparin binding ar e colored in brown, or in gold for those that had at least 10-fold impact upon transduction levels or infectivit y. The heparin footprint ha s at its center the three residues with strongest impact (R 448/585 ,R451/588 and R 350/487 ), but it extends to include other charged residues for which consistent mutagenesis results have not be en obtained. The footprint contains many residues (brown and gold) whose interactions were not det ected previously. The gold-colored residues were previously hypothesized to affect transduction throug h a secondary receptor binding site proposed to be distinct from the heparin binding site, but several are within the heparin footprint. 85 the complex covers the struct ure more generously than that of the native, resulting in a small peak in the center of the pocket that is not experimentally signi cant. What should not be lost in this detailed di scussion is that there is no evidence for large scale receptor-induced conformational changes. It is only the density near the 3- fold that rises clearly above the noise. Ther e are several other peaks at about the noise level, but there are no pai red regions of positive and negative density that would be indicative of conformational cha nge. Furthermore, there is no connection of these peaks to the site of heparin attachment near the 3-fold. Even though large conformational changes are not observed, there may be side chain rearrangements and small heparin-indu ced backbone adjustments which would only be seen at resolutions better than 8 \u00c5. It is also possible that subtle changes are masked by the partial heparin occupancy leading to a mixture of states in the complex. It is also possible that conformational change could depend upon asymmetry between a bound site and unoccupied neighbors, which is not seen in the current multi-ligand complex, but, to the authors, this seems implausible in the absence of any observed conformational changes. In summary, with se veral caveats, this study cannot exclude the possibility that there ar e subtle changes of small magnitude, but it does rule out large receptor-induced conformational cha nges that would have been apparent in maps of such high quality. 4.3.4 Capsid-receptor interactions Intriguingly, the contact residues for the most tightly bound part of the heparin are R448/R585 , R451/588 which are not conserved among AAV serotypes, even those that are closely related, such as AAV-3 and AAV-6, human serotypes that are known to bind heparin and are 89% and 85% identical in capsid sequence respectively [28, 232, 258] (Table 1). In the other serotypes, they ar e replaced, for the most part, with polar residues, Ser, Thr, Gln or Asn that are also commonly part of heparin-binding regions [72], but unlikely to form associations that are as strong. The non-conserved R 448/R585 , R451/588 form part of a contiguous itively charged surface with R 347/484 , R350/487 , 218] (Fig. 4.4A), but ther e has not been consensus in prior studies of the importance of these residues . There are many plausible reasons for 86 apparent discrepancies includi ng possible differences between cell entry via heparan sulfate attachment and physical measures of the binding to the analog, heparin. Much can be learned by integrating the cu rrent complex struct ure with three prior studies in which the effects of mutati ng many of these residues upon heparin binding were [5, 49, 254]. R 448/585 and R 451/588 , which had strong impact in all three studies, are in the center of t he observed heparin-binding site. R 350/487 and R 347/484 were found to be important in the study of Kern et al. (2003), but less so in the studies of Opie et al. (2003) and Lochrie et al. (2006). The current EM structure shows that R 350/487 makes contact with the heparin density just below R 448/585 while R 347/484 is only slightly further removed, and still in the rst shell of heparin nei ghbors to the side of R 451/588 . There has been greater discrepancy in the mutational data for K 395/532 , and K 390/527 leading to different conclusions about thei r importance. The EM structure shows that both are in contact with the edge of the heparin, supporting the earlier, not later, mutational data. On the other hand, R 347/484 , studied by Kern et al. (2003) is buried four amino acids below, indicating that any effect upon heparin-binding would have to be collateral. The G 375/512P mutant studied by Lochrie et al. (2006) is slightly removed from the heparin, but sits immediately below K 390/527 ,so collateral effect upon heparin-binding is plausible. The measured effects upon heparin -binding of several multi-site mutants Lochrie et al., (2006) is more dif cult to rationalize unless there are more substantial collateral effects through which buried resi dues have impact, or unless the modest changes in binding are withi n experimental error. 4.4 Conclusions In summary, consensus emerged from mutagenesis studies that R 448/585 , R451/588 and R 347/484 are critical in AAV-2/HS interact ions. There has been little agreement on three other basic resi dues in the area: R 350/487 , K395/532 and K 390/527 whose contact may be less intimate, but, as now seen, also fall within the binding foot print. The current EM structure shows, for the rst time, the full extent of the f ootprint. The structure arbiters the inconsistencies between the mutagenesis studies, and suggests t hat some of the 87 assays reveal the strongest interactions, while others remain undetected. This is relevant to the following point. The mutagenesis data have also been used to infer co-receptor interactions in cases where mutation affects infectivity or transduction, but not heparin binding [5]. Details of the interpretation need revision in light of the structure reported here. The heparin binding footprint is much larger than implicated by Lochrie et al., comprising a contiguous area of 36 amino acids (Table 2). This footprint is consistent with the prior studies in that it encloses all surface residues positively implicated in at l east one of the mutagenesis studies. Within this area, however, are many additional resi dues whose interactions with heparin were not detected by the prior me thods. Of the 36 ami no acids in the footprint, 19 have previously been mutated with 6 having detectable impact in at least one of the studies. Those successfully identi ed were core interactions with positively charged residues. Remaining undetected were contributions fr om neighboring polar side chains that are also expected to contribute [72]. The apparent lack of heparin interaction combined with impact upon transduction led one study to c onclude that a \"dead zone\" region on the plateau where such residues were concentra ted was the likely site of co-receptor binding [5]. However, the footprint revealed in the current work includes 10 of the 17 amino acids assigned to this site. This does not eliminate the possibility that the plateau is involved with co-receptor binding, but it undercuts a principal argument. The issue remains open pending more de nitive evidence. Given the laboratory-dependent Table 4.2 Amino acids at the AAV 2 heparin interface Direct contacts with the heparin dens ity (contoured at 4.7 e.u ) are made by 23 amino acids. Another 13 have side chains with unobstructed access to the density through a short gap that might be filled with solvent or disordered parts of the heparin. 88 variation in assaying several mutants, it is reasonable to question whether some heparin interactions have been harder to detect than effects upon transduction. Alternatively, it is possible that some mutations within the f ootprint might have an indirect effect upon transduction t hat is greater than a direct affect upon heparin binding, if HSPG still binds, but in a conformation that is not so favorable fo r ternary interactions between virus, HSPG and co-receptor needed for ce ll entry. In fact, this is only one of many possible explanations, but speculat ion should be limited until it is understood whether the variation in reported mutant phenotypes re flects something more signi cant than experimental errors and sensitivity. In the current work, more questions are re-opened than answered. However, visualization of the full f ootprint has taken us beyond t he prior mutagenic studies, resolving some of the past discrepancies. The broad extent of the f ootprint has provided a foundation for understanding how serotypes such as AAV-3 might bind HSPG, albeit with different af nity, even though residues previous ly implicated in AAV-2/heparin interactions are not conserved. The size of the footprint highlights the potential importance of ternary viru s interactions involving both primary and secondary receptors. Finally, connecting heparin densit y between symmetry-related binding sites indicates how higher af nity multi-valent binding can be achieved. 89 CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH 5.1 Conclusions 5.1.1 Cryo-EM Reconstructions This thesis describes the technique of 3D cryo-EM and how it was used to further understand viral-host interactions of AAV-2. Cryo-EM reconstructions were performed on AAV-2 with and without an attached 17kDa receptor analog fragment, at resolutions of 8.3\u00c5 and 7.8\u00c5 respectively. The resolu tions attained are among the highest obtained for any parvovirus and virus-receptor complex [33, 207]. At such resolutions, secondary structures are clearly visible, which are indicative of subnanometer resolution (Fig. 5.1). The presence of surface exposed loops on t he outer surface of the viral capsid and - helices and -sheets along the inner surface can easily be visualized. The -sheets are from the jelly-roll motif of the capsid subunit. The surface loops are long peptide insertions located betw een two strands of the -sheets. These features are common indictors of data quality [207, 259]. A comparison between the AAV-2-heparin and native AAV-2 reconstruction clearly shows that the only difference is t he addition of heparin density within the 3-fold spikes. There are no visible signs of heparin density elsewhere or a heparin-induced conformational change in the capsid. The vi ral surface surrounding the 2- and 5-fold areas appear identical between the two maps. Nevertheless, for judicious analysis, a difference map was created to highlight differenc es and locate areas on the viral surface where heparin attaches to most tightly. Areas on the viral surface that have the greatest affinity for heparin are indicated with the strongest difference peaks in the difference map. The peaks with the strongest height are near resides that had the greatest impact in prior mutagenic studies from Opie, Kern, and Lochrie et al. [5, 49, 50]. The peaks are located just off the viral surface near a concentration of 6 positively charged residues, the closest two are R 448/585 and R 451/588 , about 4.7\u00c5 and 6.9 \u00c5 away (respectively) from the highest peak at +6.9 e.u. Strong density > 6 e.u. is an elongated strand which wraps 90 around the inner shoulder of each 3-fold related spike extending towards symmetry related neighbors.

The following summarizes their methodology, results, and conclusions. It will be reviewed and compared with my own cryo-EM reconstructions. 5.1.3 Methods and Materials Virus particles were produced from 293 ce lls under an expression vector which encodes the capsid gene ( cap) ORF. Virus particles produced from this expression system have the full complement of caps id proteins, VP1, VP2, and VP3, but do not contain DNA. These are di fferent from those used for the current cryo-EM reconstructions in that they are devoid of DNA and are not capabl e of replicating. Particles produced from this expression system are called \"VLPs\" or virus-like particles in contrast with those produc ed in our system which is wild type AAV-2. To distinguish between the two sets of reconstructions, the following section will refer to the virus and virus-heparin complex from Le vy et al. (2009) as \"VLP\" and \"VLP-heparin\" respectively. Reconstructions described in the beginning of this chapter will be called \"AAV-2\" and \"AAV-2-heparin\". While the source of the capsids is different , as indicated below, it is unlikely to be the material difference that ac counts for the different conclusions of the two studies. To prepare VLP-heparin complexes, VLPs were mixed with a heparin oligosaccharide with an average molecular mass of 6kDa, at a virus to receptor ratio of 120:1, or 2 oligosacchar ides per receptor binding site. Images were collected on film at 200kV with an under-focus range of .5 - 3.0 m. The film was scanned with 7 m step- size and twofold binned, which corresponds to a pixel size of 3.68\u00c5 on the specimen scale. A total of 2335 VLP's and 1523 VLP-heparin particles were boxed out and processed using a model based routine wit h AAV-5 as the starting model. 2045 VLP and 1466 VLP-heparin particles were included fo r each final reconstruction. Resolution was assessed by an even-odd test (using a F ourier shell correlation (FSC) cut-off of 0.5). The resolution of the VLP was 12\u00c5 and the VLP-heparin complex was 18\u00c5. Thus, compared to my studies, the heparin was of smaller size (6 kDa vs. 17 kDa), fewer images were collected (1523 cf. 5950 for the complex), and the resolution achieved was 92 significantly lower (18 \u00c5 cf. 8.3 \u00c5). The resolu tion is likely a critical difference, because Fourier theory indicates t hat the information content, which depends on the inverse cube of resolution, is 10-fold higher in an 8.3 \u00c5 map than in an 18 \u00c5 map, all other things being equal. For difference map analysis, the VLP recons truction was low-pass filtered to 18 \u00c5 and subtracted from a scaled (density range and magnification) VLP-heparin complex. Difference data were interpreted at a densit y strength of 1 and .5 sigma. (No details were given regarding how the -levels were calculated, although sigma usually refers to one standard deviation within the map. 5.1.4 Comparing and contrast ing 3DEM reconstructions 5.1.4.1 3DEM native reconstructions, co mparing VLP and AAV-2 to the crystal structure. The VLP reconstruction (Fig 5.2) was initially processed to 12 \u00c5 but was low pass filtered to equal resolution as the VLP-heparin map at 18 \u00c5 for proper comparison with the VLP-heparin map. Each native reconstructi on, VLP and AAV-2, are commensurate with the AAV-2 crystal structure low-passed to equal resolution providing validity to the control reconstructions. The c apsid surface of the VLP reconstruction and crystal structure at 18\u00c5 ar e smooth and shows no signs of surface exposed loops. The 5-fold channel is not empty and faintly s hows signs of pentagona l symmetry which is due to the DE loops lining the outer rim. The AAV-2 reconstruction corresponds well with the crystal structure at equal resolution. It has a rough su rface topology from intra -strand loops such as HI that form the surface of the depression surrounding the 5-fold and DE, which line the rim of the channel. 5.1.4.2 3DEM Complex Reconstructions , comparing VLP-heparin and AAV-2- heparin to native reconstructions. A side by side comparison of VLP-heparin and VLP from Levy et al. (2009) is provided in figur e 5.2. The intention of this figure is to show the areas of the capsid surface that differ between the two maps. These differences give rise to the peaks in their difference map. Addition al panels within the figure show magnified views of the 2-fold ( panels 5.2B and panels 5.2B, 5.2F, 5.2C, 93 and 5.2G, the dashed circle highlights \"regions of obvious difference\". These regions are the areas of capsid surface that generated large positive difference peaks, which were shown later in the paper. It is difficult to discern the differences, which may be exacerbated by the small figure size. Unfortunately, no other figure comparing both reconstructions was provided. Panels 5.2B and 5.2F show a close up of the 2-fold area. An area is highlighted with a dashed circle. This corresponds to an area of the capsid su rface near a positive difference density peak. Thus, we should expect to see surface feat ures in the complex map that occupy a space that is absent in the native map. Ho wever, it is unclear what the differences are within the circle since they are not explicitly pointed out. A recognizable difference at the 2-fold regi on is the appearance of a small bump in the native map that is absent in the complex map. The bump is close to the base of the 3- fold spikes near the valley which separates neighboring peaks. Panels 5.2G and 5.2H show close ups of the 3-fold areas. A dashed circle is directly over the 3-fold axis of symmetry. Similar to the 2-fold, a circle is shown intending to mark regions of obvious differences and likewise, it is difficult to see what they are referring to. Figure 5.2D and 5.2H shows a magnified vi ew of the 5-fold, a location with the most obvious difference. The outer rim of t he VLP-heparin map is circular and drops off less towards the surround areas than the native VLP map. In the native VLP map, the Figure of complex.

[8] with permission) 94 5-fold channel has just enough resolution to see the beginnings of a pentagon shape from 5-fold related DE loops. In the VLP-hep arin map, the rim is circular rather than pentagonal as the VLP map. The authors claim t he 5-fold channel opens up more in the VLP-heparin and rotates 36o. A black dot is placed in each figure to represent the location of a single DE loop before and after a 36o rotation. However, there are simply not enough features in the VLP-heparin map to visualize this rotation. The authors state the channel opens up. The outer most portion of the ch annel rim in each map appears to be of nearly equal width (compare figure 5.2B and 5.2F). The central area in the outer rim is depressed more in the VLP-heparin m ap and the rim itself drops off less towards the surrounding surface. This creates an appearance that the channel is wider. A different conclusion is reached in the comparison of the AAV-2-heparin and AAV-2 reconstructions showing a clear differenc e, that of additional density between the 3-fold peaks, an area previously implicated in receptor binding. These observations contrast with those from the VLP-heparin and VLP reconstructions whose only clear difference is near the 5-fold where the channel is smoother and possibly wider. As described above in the introduction of this chapter, the density in the AAV-2-heparin map between the 3-fold peaks is clearly additional as it is not found in the AAV-2 reconstruction. Capsid regions elsewhere appear identical. 5.1.5 Comparing and contr asting difference maps. 5.1.5.1 Heparin difference density. A difference map was generated between the VLP-heparin and VLP reconstructions (Fig 5. 3). The difference map is significantly different from that generat ed between the AAV-2-heparin and AAV-2 reconstructions. The difference map between VL P-heparin and VLP rendered at 1 shows two large positive peaks directly over the 3-fold and 2- fold axis of symmetry. Additional smaller positive peaks surround the 5-fold axis of sy mmetry. These were interpreted to be a result from a conformational change and wi ll be discussed in the section below. Over the 2-fold surface is an elongated peak that ext ends toward the \"walls\" of the 2-fold axis. The term \"wall\" refers to a lo cation of the viral capsid near the 2-fold axis. It connects the surface depression at the 2-fold with th e valley which is located between the 3-fold peaks. At a lower contour level of 0.5 , the authors state but do not show that difference density extends from the wall of the two-fold axes between the 95 threefold protrusions towards the 3-fold axis of symmetry. They also state that density at this lower (0.5 ) level is near to the residues imp licated in binding heparin through prior mutagenic studies [5, 49, 254]. However, this 0.5 level is lower than the 1.0 level that the authors are able to interpret in terms of a pseudo -atomic model of heparin.

(2009) with permission) 96 5.1.5.2 Pseudoatomic model of heparin. A heparin decasaccharide was built into a portion of the difference peak near the walls of the 2-fold axis (Fig 5.3). A single disaccharide was also built into the differenc e density at the 3-folds. The authors admit that the oligosaccharides built into the pos itive difference density are too far from the heparin binding residues for direct contact in the current configur ation. It was proposed that the interaction between mutagenically implicated heparin binding residues and fitted oligosaccharides could be mediated by solvent molecules and/or a conformational change induced by heparin could bring the residues into closer contact. If it were the latter, then characteristic features in the difference map would be expected, as described below. 5.1.5.3 Conformation changes. Conformational changes should be indicated with positive and negative difference peaks correspond ing to location where a feature moved to and the location where it moved from. Tw o conformational changes are proposed in the VLP-heparin map. The firs t change was invoked to bring previously implicated viral amino acids into contact wit h the modeled oligosacchari de. The authors suggest an alteration occurs within the capsid shell brin ging the heparin bindi ng residues closer to the fitted oligosaccharide in the 2-fold difference peak. The proposed conformation change is described as a flattening of the 3-fold peaks and a raising of the 2-fold floor, which together bring the heparin binding resid ues, as well as additional basic residues into the positive differenc e density at the 2-fold. Difference density to support the flattening of the spikes is with large negative peaks located at the tips of the three-fold spikes in the difference map. Support for a conformation change at the two fold floor s hould be with a positive difference peak in the region where the protein is moving to and a negative peak where it is moving from. However, there is only a positive difference peak and no negative peak. This was observed by the authors and said to be due to subtle movements or low resolution of the maps. A second conformational change is proposed around the 5-fold region which is described as a widening of the channel and a 36o rotation of the DE loops.

Figures (A and B) were generated using RobEM (Baker et al., 1999) a nd (C-F) by Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004). (Figure and figure caption from Levy et al. 2009 with permission) 98 density to support this is from two sets of positive and negative peaks around the 5-fold areas. There are positive peaks located above t he 5-fold related depression of the viral capsid and negative peaks located within the capsid shell in the depression surrounding the channel (Fig 5.4). The authors state that this se t of peaks are due to a 90o rotation of the HI loop away from the viral surface. The peaks were superimposed onto a crystal structure to show their relative location. A second set of positive and negative peaks at 1 are located near the 5-fold axis of symmetry (Fig 5.4). Within the channel , directly along the axis of symmetry, is a large negative peak. It is surrounded by a circular tube of positive de nsity located within the DE loops of the channel. The authors propose that this is a result of the channel becoming wider and rotating 36o. The authors show the befor e and after movement with a black dot in figure 2.2D and 2.2H. At the current resolution of the map, it is difficult to visualize molecular movements. Moreover, the level of experi mental noise on the 5-fold axis is sqrt(5)-fold higher. Thus, the peak alo ng the axis is not expe rimentally significant [259]. In support of the proposed conformati onal change around the channel, Levy et al. (2009) cited numerous mutagenic studies that collectively indicate this area to play an important role in capsid assembly, pack aging, and infectivity [ 37, 39, 54, 260-263]. Comparisons were also made to the cryo-E M reconstruction of human parvovirus B19 attached with its globoside receptor [264], studied by some of t he same authors. Two sets of peaks could be seen in the differ ence map between the B19-receptor complex and native B19. The most pr ominent was a height of 4.5 (1 is 1 standard deviation of the difference density) above t he background noise. It was loca ted at the 3-fold area and interpreted as bound receptor, although this was retracted later (1.Kaufmann, B. et al. Parvovirus B19 does not bind to memb rane-associated globoside in vitro. Virology 332, 189-98 (2005)). The second se t of peaks at a height of 2 could have represented conformational change but the aut hors noted were most likely noise. Levy et al. had at their disposal a weal th of mutagenic data which suggested that the channel and surrounding HI loops played important roles in some stage of viral infectivity. It seems that out of the many steps that mu tation could be affecting, Levy et 99 al. have assumed that it is a speculative re ceptor-induced conformational change. Then the approximate co-location of EM diffe rence peaks makes a compelling story. Unfortunately, contrary to the discussion by Levy et al. , evidence to back the assertion is lacking. Firstly, the di fference peaks taken as evidence of HI-loop conformational change are at the 1 level which most would regard as falling within experimental noise. Secondly, the negative peaks do not superimpose on the unbound conformation of the HI loop. Thirdly, there is no ev idence (from the EM) of a conformational change propagated through the capsid that might link the changes of the HI loop with receptor- binding near the 3-fold axes. Finally, our ow n reconstructions of a fundamentally similar complex, but at higher resolution, s how no evidence of the purported HI loop conformational change. This seems to be a ca se of over-interpretation of noise in the EM reconstruction, encouraged by the apparent consistency of the interpretation with one possible rationalization of prior mutational data. 5.1.5.4 Ordering of DNA. Additional positive differenc e density in the shape of a dodecahedron was observed along the interior of the capsid shell. The density spans between the 3-fold axes through the 2-fold area. It is stated to be due to DNA that becomes ordered upon heparin binding. Two visual pieces of evidence are prov ided to support this ordering of DNA. The first is that ordered nucleotides in the crystal structures of the MVM and AAV-4 fit into this difference density [265, 266]. The second line of support is a figure showing a cross section of the VLP and VLP-hep arin capsid (Fig 5.4). Criticisms similar to those about the proposed conformational changes can also be leveled at the interpretation of DNA structure. 5.1.5.5 Differenc mapping. More needs to be said regarding difference mapping. A review into the literature demonstrates t hat there is no fine line between signal and noise in a difference map. There are many ways to display and interpret reconstructions and difference maps. Common ways to display a di fference map are to either show it by itself or as superimposed ont o a reconstruction [267, 268]. Generally, no processing is done to the difference map once it is generated. This is not always the case. One study first used a program to remove small bits of density which were probably noise [207]. While this type of filtering may not have much bearing on biological interpretation, it 100 generally makes the reconstructions appear to have less noise than is naturally present. What is the appropriate contour level to disp lay isosurface values? The display contour level varies in the literature but is genera lly between 3 and 1 standard deviations of the difference [252, 269, 270]. Occasionally, mult iple thresholds are displayed to show regions of strong and weak density [271]. Th is is commonly performed if the ligand is flexible. Another criteria used to display at a particular threshold is to use some type of intrinsic measurement, such as to display the isosurface at a volume that is equal to the molecular volume of the ligand [269, 271]. A pr oblem with this approach is that flexibility may render disordered parts of the molecule invisible. The point of emphasis here is that in difference maps, ther e are both real features and noi se. There are no uniformly accepted criteria for distinguish ing real features in an EM reconstruction from those of noise. In the reconstructions of AAV-2 and AAV-2-heparin, the scale for displaying isosurface representations was based on the e rror unit (e.u.). As descr ibed in chapter 4, the error unit allows the display of contours based on scale of experimental noise. This is different from the commonl y used sigma value which is a measure of both noise and signal. Regardless of what the unit of density is, proper and robust interpretation includes some type of inter nal measurement control. This helps determine the threshold between signal and noise. In the diffe rence map between AAV- 2 and AAV-2-heparin, three different internal measurements were used to suggest that the transition from noise to real features occurs between +/-2.5 e.u. and +/-4.5 e.u. Once the signal to noise transition level was established, differ ence peaks were interpreted from strongest to weakest, noting that symmetry axes t end to have greater noise. Difference peaks were interpreted to +/-4.5 e.u. Peaks lo wer than this were only interpreted very cautiously and with explicit caveats, bec ause their height was commensurate with the noise level. The explicit analysis of erro r in our study is not the norm, and Levy et al. calibrate their analysis in te rms of the more usual map units, which, contrary to the name, are not only a measure of map error, but as the square root of the variance in density levels through the map, also represent the magnitude and extent (in volume) of differences between the two structures. Thei r values can be lowered misleadingly ~2- fold by inclusion of masked or solvent regi ons in the calculation which can occur by 101 default in some calculations. We do not know the details of how the -levels were calculated by Levy et al. , but we can, for the sake of argument, assume that they took as much care as we did. The magnitude of the 4.5 e.u. peaks that are interpreted in our study are at the 2.85 -level by calculating a histogram of the difference map itself. By comparison, Levy et al. are interpreting featur es in the 0.5 to 1.0 range. In summary, it is my contention that Levy et al. fail to provide any experimental evidence for their intriguing conclusion that heparin-binding causes far-reaching receptor-induced conformational changes to the AAV capsid, and that there is, at this point, no reason to doubt our own, more cons ervative, conclusions that are based on a more careful study at mu ch higher resolution. 5.1.6 New insights into AAV-2 host cell interaction Integrating prior mutagenic studies with the current AAV- 2 and AAV-2-heparin cryo-EM reconstructions provides deeper insi ght into our understanding of viral-host interactions. A total of 23 amino acids make direct contacts with the heparin density. Another 13 have side chains with unobstructed access to the density which could bind heparin through a disordered part. In the mutagenic studies, there is a lack of consensus in the import ance of the residues R 350/487 , K395/532 , and K 390/527 , however are now shown to fall within t he binding footprint. Included in the 36 residues is G 375/512 , which was implicated by Lochrie et al. (2006) to be important in heparin binding. It is slightly removed from the hepar in binding residues, below K 390/527 , but sits within the heparin footprint. All 36 residues are in vicinity to play a role in heparin binding after initial attachment of virus to receptor. Cell su rface attachment by AAV-2 may be initiated principally through the cluster of basic residu es located along the shoulder of the trimer spikes. Once localized on the cell surface, AAV-2 may fortify attachment through the binding of disordered parts of heparin with additional residues outside the basic residue cluster. The AAV-2-heparin reconstruction shows for t he first time the fu ll extent of the heparin binding footprint. It encloses all of t he surface residues positively implicated in at least one of the mutagenic studies. Ho wever, many additional residues whose interactions with heparin were not detected by prior methods are within the heparin 102 footprint. Lochrie et al. ( 2006) found an area of 17 amino ac ids on the viral surface which if mutated reduced transduction but reta ined the ability to bind heparin. This led the authors to suggest the region of the vi ral surface where such residues were concentrated to be the location of co-receptor binding. However, 10 of these 17 amino acids fall within the heparin footprint. This bri ngs us to the following questions: Were the interactions of these amino ac ids with primary recept or harder to detect ? Alternatively, does mutation of these have an indirect im pact upon transduction that is greater than that of heparin binding? In the latter scenario , an indirect impact on transduction could occur if amino acids within the footprint are involved with ternary interactions with heparin and co-receptor. Here, a mutant may still bind heparin, however in a conformation that is disfavored for co-receptor binding. Additional data is required to understand more clearly which amino acids play an important role in co-receptor binding. 5.2 Future research 5.2.1 Obtaining a higher resoluti on AAV-2-heparin reconstruction. The difference map between AAV-2- heparin and AAV-2 was systematically searched for evidence of a heparin-induced conformational change in the capsid. This should be apparent with adjacent negative and pos itive density in the difference map. There was no evidence of a conformational change. It is quite possible that side chain rearrangements and subtle hep arin-induced backbone adjustments have occurred but are masked by inadequate resolution, which is currently at 8.3\u00c5. A larger data set of better quality can help in this regard. Signifi cant improvements in sample preparation have become available and have been successfully tested on AAV-2 for improved data quality. In addition to the sample preparation advancements, more exciting advancements in imaging are on the horizon for the Biological Science Imaging Resource at Florida State University. T hese improvements and how they can be applied to a second AAV-2-heparin structure with higher resolution are discussed below. 103 5.2.2. Vitrobot Recently, a machine called the Vitrobot has become available (s ee section 2.2.2 for a description and figure 2.3 for an illustra tion). The Vitrobot aut omates the sample preparation process and is the newest developm ent. It provides improved consistency in the sample preparation process with com puter regulation of key parameters that affect thin aqueous film formation process. This allows the fine tuning of blotting parameters to achieve the highest quality samples. A major factor in generating im ages of high quality is the level of ice thickness in the holes of the grid. The grids prepared fo r the AAV-2-heparin study were prepared by manual blotting methods (section 2.2.2 and Fig. 2.3). Although identical blotting parameters were used for each grid (blotting durat ion, type of filter paper, etc.) the level of ice thickness varied significantly from gr id to grid. This level of is unfortunately common common in sample pr epration in cryo-EM. The vitrobot has already been tested on AAV-2 and has not only been more consistent in the production of samples suit able for imaging than with prior methods, but the samples generated were of equal quality as those from prior methods. Because the grids are consistently produc ed with similar ice thickness, the blotting time has been adjusted to generate ultra thin samples where t he ice thickness is close to the diameter of the viral particles (~25nm). A sign that the ice thickness is close to the size of the specimen is when the particles are squished to the periphery of t he hole due to the formation of a meniscus in the hole. Images of AAV-2 squished to the side of holes are routinely generated in grids prepared with the Vitrobot (see Fi g. 2.1 for an example). Automated sample preparation with t he Vitrobot not only makes sample preparation more convenient but consistently generates samples of very high quality. This allows the possibility of collecting very large data sets (~100,000 particles) of good quality. Granted, not all of t he images will be equal in qualit y but the advantage of large data sets is that data of poor quality may be removed leaving only those of the highest quality. 104 5.2.3. Titan Krios and Leginon Under ideal imaging conditions such as low noise levels, zero specimen drift, and aberration-free lenses, approximately a littl e over 10,000 images are required for averaging and reconstructing an object to ~3 \u00c5 [272, 273]. The reason why so many images are required is that biological sample s are susceptible to radiation damage due to inelastic scattering of electrons with the obj ect [274]. In order to avoid this, images are acquired with very low doses (~30e-/\u00c52), which do not severely degrade the sample but generate images that have a low signal to noise ratio (SNR). To increase the SNR, many images are acquired and are averaged together. However, in practice often substantially greater number of image s are required to obtain an intermediate resolution reconstr uction (10-20\u00c5) [275]. This reason more images are required is that im aging is not under ideal conditi ons. It is affected by a variety of factors which attenuate the signal at high spatial frequency such as lens aberrations and specimen movement (see section 2.4.1.2. for details). To increase the resolution of a reconstruction from interme diate to subnanometer resolution (1nm=10\u00c5) and beyond, the required num ber of images increases exponentiall y [193]. Not all images have the same level of quality and one should not expect a quality reconstruction from simply having colle cted a large data set. The quality of the reconstruction is largely dictated by the quality in the data and this depends on many parameters during the imaging proc ess (note: this is not taking into consideration errors in the processing stage). Cryo-EM studies per formed on GroEL, a molecular chaperone, clearly indicate that modifying image par ameters can affect the quality of the reconstruction [181, 205]. In these studies, individual reconstructions were performed from data collected at eit her low magnification (50,000X), high magnification (100,000X), areas of thick ice or thin ice. Also, reconstructions were compared from data sets that did and did not have poor dat a removed. To briefly summarize their results, the authors conclude d that the quality of a reconstruction may be enhanced by collecting data from areas of thin ice, e liminating data of poor qua lity, and increasing the magnification (finer sampling). This will be re levant in a future reconstruction of AAV-2- heparin at higher resolution beyond 8.3\u00c5, whic h will require a larger data set of high quality. 105 Two new additional featur es at the Biological Sc ience Imaging Resource at Florida State University, which will greatly expedite future data collection are expected to be completed at the end of the year. Thes e two features are t he installation of the Titan Krios and the Leginon autom ated data collection package. The installation of the Ti tan Krios, a stat e of the art transmission electron microscope, is expected to be complete by t he end of the year. The Titan Krios is a high performance, high throughput microscope de signed to collect data 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is flexible in its accele rating voltage, between 80 and 300kV which can be tailored to suit imaging needs. Additionally , it has a special 12 grid sample loader that allows the automated exchange of radiation damag ed samples with fresh ones . Additionally, the Leginon software program will be installed [276]. Leginon is a program which automates the dat a collection process. It is a program that is designed to mimic the microscopist by finding ar eas suitable for imaging and adjusting imaging parameters such as focus and magnification. A valuable feature is that it performs a low magnification survey of the entire grid whic h locates the areas th at are most suitable (thinnest ice) for imaging. Once a general area is located, a second inspection of ice thickness at a slightly higher magnification is performed on each hole. In the inspection process a threshold criteria for ice thickness is established whereby the thickness of every hole is compared with. If the ice is th inner than the criteria threshold, a higher magnification image is acquired. This allows t he user to judiciously select the thinnest areas with the greatest SNR. Automated data collection with Legi non has been performed successfully on GroEL [181]. In a single 25 hour session, ov er a quarter million particles images were collected and used to reconstruct an ~8\u00c5 m ap. The 3D reconstruction of AAV-2 was built by refining an initial data set of ~10, 000 particles from images that were manually collected over a period of 2 days, totaling ~15 hours of data collection time. At this rate, it would take approximately 17 days to acquire as much data as Leginon did in one day. The difference is likely from a quicker and more consistent rate of data collection. Another advantage in using Leginon for data collection is that it automatically pipes data into preliminary steps for imm ediate processing. So data is processed while additional data is collected. 106 In conjunction with one another, the vitrobot, Titan Krios and the Leginon software package not only allow a more conv enient way of collecting data but allow world class sample preparation and imaging and creates a wonderful opportunity for a high resolution reconstruction. 5.2.4 Locating the Vp1u region. As indicated above, cryo-EM is becoming an increasing used tool to help investigators understand macromolecular stru ctures. It is arguably the most robust technique available for this line of work. It has a capacity for resolving high resolution features through the use of electron cryst allography with 2D arrays or with single particle analysis of structures with a high or der of symmetry. However, it should be pointed out that symmetry is not a requirement for high resolution. The seminal work by Joachim Frank on the irregularly shaped ribo some dictates that symmetry in the specimen is merely a facilitator in this endeavor [277]. For specim ens that do not form 2D arrays or are irregular in appearance su ch as mitochondria, tomography has been very successful in obtaining 3D reconstructi ons. In tomography, images are collected at known angular increments, which are back projected into a 3D volume. Because no symmetry is enforced during t he back projection, asymmetric al macromolecular objects may be reconstructed into a 3D object. A dditionally, asymmetrical features in symmetrical objects may be visualized. For example, many icosahedral dsDNA viruses such as the P22 bacteriophage have a special 5- fold vertex that functions as a portal to shuttle DNA in and out of the icosahedral head [278]. Attached to this special vertex are additional proteins which assemble into an entire macromolec ular complex that contribute to this function. Since only a singl e vertex exists for th is function, icosahedral averaging with single particl e analysis would not allow this to be visualized. Similar to the P22 bacteriophage, AAV-2 has asymmetrical features within the icosahedral capsid shell. Howe ver, these features are not as large as the asymmetrical portal vertex. As indicated in section 1.1. 5, AAV-2 is constructed from three proteins which differ in extensions at the N-termi nus. The unique region of the N-terminus of Vp1, \"Vp1u\" has a phospholipase motif that has been shown to be crucial for infection [41]. Due to their low occupancy of the c apsid shell and possible flexibility, the icosahedral averaging that generated the X-ray struct ure and the AAV-2 and AAV-2-107 heparin cryo-EM structures did not gener ate strong enough density to reveal the structure or location of Vp1u [42]. In order to resolve the Vp1u density, one needs to avoid using icosahedral averaging. With tomogr aphy, it is possible to visualize the Vp1u region since no symmetry is used to reconstruct the object. 5.2.5 2D arrays A little creativity goes a long way. A less appreciated aspect of cryo-EM is in the varied number of ways a sample may be pr epared. This is a burgeoning and exciting area of cryo-EM. New methodologies are de veloping to facilitate the preparation and visualization of samples that are generally very difficult to work with. For example, Wang et al. noted significant difficulty in obs erving an adequate number of membrane protein containing liposomes over the holes in vitrif ied samples (see figure 2. 1 in Chapter 2 for an image of virus particles suspended over hol es) [279]. In Wang's study, the liposome serves the role of the cell membrane, so as to study the membrane protein in as close to in vivo conditions as possible. To overcome their problem of low concentration, 2D crystals of streptav idin were created that spanned the entire area of the EM grid, including the holes. The crystals were used to bind the liposome and increase its concentration over the hole because the lipos omes have biotinylated lipids which bind readily to the streptavidin 2D crystals. This helped increase the concentration of liposome over the holes for proper imaging. The above example describes just one of many creative ways to circumvent sample preparation problems for cryo-EM. The reconstructions in this thesis alone could not have been performed without a little creativity in sample preparation. As previously mentioned in chapter 4, the preparation of a heparin-AAV-2 complex was hampered by severe aggregation. This was overcome by fi rst immobilizing the virus to a thin carbon layer and then allowing it to incubate with a receptor-containing solution. Indeed, it was observed that incubati ng heparin with AAV-2 resulted in large aggregates. However, another inte resting observation was made; the formation of 2D arrays from what looked like hexagonally packed virus particles (Fig 5. 5). In this figure, a solution containing a 50:50 mixture of viru s particles that contained DNA (\"full\" capsids) and did not contain its DNA (\"emp ty\" capsids) were incubated with a 17 kDa heparin fragment at 600-fold excess relative to each virus particle. The complex was 108 allowed to incubate for an hour and prepared fo r cryo-EM. In t he images the empty particles appear as empty circles, while the full particles of similar size are filled in. Even though a 50:50 mixture of empt y and full particles were used, the 2D array is predominantly formed by full capsids. The i nability of the empty particles to form within the 2D arrays suggests that they are different in size and/or structure. Support for this lies in the lone empty capsid wi thin the middle of the 2D arra y (black arrow in Fig. 5.5). It is surrounded by 5 neighboring particles, not 6 as most of the other s are. Its presence may have distorted the 2D latti ce to an extent that the 6th neighbor couldn't fit appropriately, or the empty par ticle might be asymmetric, so that it does not form a complete set of spherical close packing intera ctions like the full particles. The remaining empty capsids in the 2D array are located al ong the outside of the 2D array where their Figure 5.5: A vitrified sample of AAV-2 after it was incubat ed with a 600-fold excess (relative to each virion) of a 17kDa heparin fragment. The solution of AAV-2 contained a 50:50 mixture of empty and full virus capsids. In addition to aggregation (not shown) 2D arrays form, whic h vary in size. One is shown here and magnified to the right. Empty, full, and broken particle are visible and pointed out. A black arrow points to space in the capsid which is next to the only empty capsid within the 2D array (not on the perimeter). All parti cles in the array (not on the perimeter) except for the empty capsid ar e surrounded by 6 neighbors. The lack of a 6th neighbor around the empty capsid suggest that empty capsids may have a slight difference in the capsid structure, either in size, shape or symmetry such that inclusion of an empty caps id within the 2D array distorts the hexagonal lattice and prevents close packing 109 inclusion may have contributed to the arre st of 2D array formation. However, predominantly, the empty particles are f ound at much higher concentration outside the array - perhaps, again, indicative of imperfect symmetry that would be conducive to incorporation within the array. At this point, it is not known whether the empty particles represent an assembly intermediate, an assembly error, or previ ously fully assembled particles that have somehow ejected their DNA. It is possible that in some states of the empty capsid, that the VP1-unique phospholipase domains could lie external to the capsid instead of sequestered within as is hypothesized to o ccur during endosomal entry [1, 41]. This provides a motivation to study the differ ences between the in-array full particles and isolated empty particles by EM reconstr uction methods that do not need to impose Figure 5.6: A hypothetical diagram showing how the he parin-AAV-2 2D-array could be used as a substrate for A20 antibody binding. The heparin-AAV-2 2D array is show n as silver spheres. The A20 antibody is shown as a red \"Y\". If the virus and its epitopes (antibody binding site) are crystalline then the antibody could bind in an crystalline array as well. Alternatively, the 2D array may not be crystalline. Epitopes on the viral surface could be randomly oriented and buried within neighbors. An ant ibody is shown here but this could be applied to co- receptors. The attached antibody is less likely to induce aggregation since its movement is regulated by movement of the entire 2D array 110 the 60-fold symmetry (see above). The 2D arrays could also help overcome some present day problems of preparing macromolecular complexes with AAV- 2. For example, it may be used as an ordered substrate for extend ed incubation with whole A20 neutralizing antibodies. A20 is called a neutralizing antibody, which deriv es its name because it will bind to AAV-2 and neutralize, or abrogate infection. Antibodie s to viruses recognize particular features on the capsid shell. The area that antibodies recognize is called an epitope. A mapping of the epitope area is of inte rest since it could provi de insights into engineering recombinant AAV-2 vectors that can bypass immune neutralization. Cryo-EM studies of AAV-2 with A20 have been hindered by the aggr egation of virus (D. McCraw, personal communication). This is because of the dimeri c structure of antibodies that contain two epitope binding sites (paratopes). In many cases when a whole antibody binds a virus, two paratopes might bind to two (symmetrically equivalent) epitopes on the same virus, or can cross-link paratopes on two different virus particles. If the 2D array is stable enough, use of arrays as an antibody binding substrate might prevent AAV-2-A20 aggregation if the concentration of free AAV particles (out of the array) is low. Preventi on of aggregation is necessary fo r the preparation of the thin samples that are needed for high resolution TEM imaging. Will the A20 be visible in images? In cryo -EM, the gold standard of evidence that a complex has been made is by direct visual evidence. Reconstructions of virus-Fab and whole antibody complexes have been pe rformed from images where one can directly visualize the bound molecule [207, 280-282]. If the level of signal is strong enough in images of AAV-2 and A20, it is reasonable expect A20 will be visible. What orientation will the antibody be in? This unknown will depend on the orientation of each virus. In figure 5.6, two scenarios are shown. One scenario is that the 2D array is crystalline, each particle and its epitope (antibody binding site) are in identical orientation. The second scenario is of non-crystalline array. If this were the case, some epitopes may be exposed while ot hers would be blocked from neighbors. Steric hindrance may also prevent some an tibodies from binding to solvent exposed epitopes. 111 There are additional applicat ions of these 2D arrays. It could be used create a complex between AAV-2 and co-r eceptor similar to what was proposed with A20. The driving force behind the use of 2D arrays in forming a complex with AAV-2 is that A20 aggregates AAV-2 which makes structural studies difficult. At the pres ent moment, it is unknown whether co-receptor and AAV-2 binding induce aggregation. If aggregation does, in fact, occur, than the 2D array may provide an alternative approach that could bypass this. Alternatively, if co-recept or and AAV-2 binding does not induce aggregation but there are only one or a few co-receptor b ound to the viral capsid, than the 2D array could be used in conjunction with tomography. This 2D array could be used to investi gate a possible unique vertex in the viral capsid. This was introduced in section 5.2.4. and as mentioned, this type of research is suitable for tomography. An advantage of using the 2D array in tomography is that it increases the number of particles in view, and the array packing ma y limit the possible orientations of the unique mo iety, facilitating alignment. However, there are many factors which c ould affect binding of either antibody or co-receptor. For instance, it remains unknown whether the caps id integrity within this 2D array remains unaffected to an extent that it could be recognized by antibody or co- receptor. Heparin will be used to create the 2D array. In t he cryo-EM reconstructions of AAV-2-heparin, there was no appreciable confo rmation change in the capsid shell upon receptor binding. But the 2D array may induce its own alteration in the capsid shell. It should also be questioned whether heparin prevents the binding of MAb A20. Wobus et al. showed that while A20 neutrali zed AAV-2 infection, AAV-2 still retains the ability to bind to the cell surface [219]. Th is suggests that the epitope for A20 and the heparin binding site do not overlap to an ext ent that it would prevent viral binding. This is a very exciting time for t he AAV-2 and cryo-EM commu nities. The cryo- EM reconstruction of AAV-2 attached to hepar in is the first of many possible AAV complexes that could be studied by cryo-EM. Many new avenues exist for the future. Different co-receptors are curr ently being tested for binding such as alternative forms of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) and 51 integrin. Also, Ternary complexes of co-receptor with heparin are also being te sted for possible future structural work. Upon verification of binding, the choice in methodology for reconstr uction may ultimately 112 have to be made at a later date as it highly depends on receptor occupancy and homogeneity of the complexes. In images where complexes appear to have low- occupancy, tomography can be employed. For particles that appear to have full occupancy of symmetry related binding sites, single particle analysis is an obvious choice. This type of processing is ideal for virus particles with full occupancy. With the installation of the Titan Krios and the Legino n software to allow data collection 24 hours a day and seven days a week, along with t he availability of high performance computing, it would not take much time for an intermediate microscopist to reconstruct a high resolution AAV-2 map by single-particle analysis. It is exciting to think of what areas of the viral surface are responsible for infection. Will the co-receptor require heparin for a ternary binding interaction or might it bind independently? Will the co-recept or footprint be close to that of heparin? Will it be further away? Will there be any overlap? Wi ll there be a conformation change in the capsid upon co-receptor binding? Will the mi ssing N-terminus finally become visible or remain elusive? These are just a few of many questions that will be asked, and hopefully answered to better understand viral- host interactions as we learn how to improve the specificity of AAV for use in gene therapy treatments of genetic disorders. 113 APPENDIX A CONFIRMING THE FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR IS BOUND TO AAV-2 The following describes pre liminary steps into a thir d research project. This project is investigating the in teraction of AAV-2 with one of it s co-receptor, the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1). The overall goal is to pr epare an FGFR1-virus complex for cryo-EM imaging and three dimensio nal reconstruction, similar to that which was done with the AAV-2-heparin complex described in chapter 4. Before significant time and effort is to be employed upon imaging, refinement, and analysis, it is important to verify that our receptor is binding to AAV-2. Various biochemical assays were performed to test for binding. These were performed by post-doctoral fellow Tom Learch and included a dot blot, an ELISA, and an immunoprecipitation assays. An alternative approach that was performed in parallel was to visualize binding by direct detection with EM imaging. Here , virus and receptor would be allowed to incubate together and imaged with an electron microscope. Through trial and error, variations in the incubations schemes were required to allow sufficient incubation and visualization. Unfortunately, each approach yielded inconclusi ve results. The incubation methodology, imaging, and resu lts are discussed below. A.1 Introduction A.1.1 History of Fibroblast growth factor receptor Insight into the existence of the Fibroblas t growth factor receptor (FGFR1) first occurred approximately 60 years ago in 1939 where It was shown that bovine brain extracts promoted the proliferat ion of a fibroblast cell line in vitro [283]. Later in the 70's it was discovered that a 15kDa molecule was responsible for this proliferative activity. The molecule was called the Fibroblast Gr owth Factor (FGF) and two forms were discovered. One was called basic FGF (bFG F) and the other, acid ic FGF (aFGF) for their respectively higher and lower isoelectr ic points [284, 285]. In the middle of the 114 80's, heparin a linear polysaccharide was shown to potentiate the activity of aFGF and bFGF by binding and localizing it to the ce ll surface [286, 287]. However, it was the work by Shing et al. with the discovery of a heparin affinity purification protocol which generated a significantly greater quantity of purifi ed FGF. This was pivotal towards expediting its molecular characterization. Today , the fibroblast growth factor family is one of the largest growth factor fa milies comprised of 22 members [87]. Inceptive observations regarding FGF binding to cell receptors was by Moscatelli et al in 1987 [288]. It was obs erved that hamster kidney ce lls had two binding sites for FGF that differed in their level of affini ty, one had low affinity while the other had high affinity. This was determined by the conditi ons which were required to remove the FGF molecule from the surface. Binding between t he FGF and its low affinity receptor could be abrogated by 2M NaCl, competed by hepar in, and significantly reduced with the addition of heparinase. Collectively, these re sults strongly implicated that cell surface heparin sulfate molecules were the low affi nity receptor. FGF re moval from the high affinity receptor required a low pH (4.5) in addition to 2M NaCl. It was not clear what the high affinity receptor was at the time. In the late 80's, FGF binding to the hi gh affinity binding site was shown to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylat ion within 30 seconds of exposure [289]. This was the first piece of data to implicate the high affini ty receptor to a biological effect. Initial purification and isolatio n of the high affinity receptor was with the use of a novel FGF affinity column that pulled out the receptor from chicken embryos solution [290]. Today there are currently 4 genes in humans which encode Fibroblast growth factor receptor- 1,-2,-3, and -4 [291-294]. Collectively, they play a versatile and important role in the human body starting within the developing embryo and continuing onwards into the mature adult [295, 296]. Some of the ro les are tissue homeosta sis, wound healing, cholesterol metabolism, and tissue repair [ 297-300]. Humans that do not have properly functioning FGFR1 develop into various dise ased states. For example, craniosynostosis affects 1 in 2500 with diverse syndromes su ch as Apert syndromes (AS), Crouzon syndrome (CS) and Pfeiffer syndrome to name a few [301-303]. Other effects by mis- functioning FGFR1 lead to cancer [304] and A.1.2 FGFR1 Molecular advances led to detailed characterization of FGFR1. A schematic diagram of a recept or is given in figure A.1. The receptor contains three domains, an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic domain which contains tyrosine kinase activity. The extracellular domain are num bered 1-3, distal to proximal from the cell surface respectively and generally are labeled in text with an \"Ig\" or \"D\" in front of the number. For example the outer domain ma y be called \"Ig1\" or \"D1\". Between D1 and D2 is a segment of acidic amino acids called the \"acid box\". Closer to the cell surface in D2 are the bindi ng sites for FGF and heparin, the latter site is abbreviated \"HBS\". It is proposed that D1 and the acid box have inhibitory functions. The inhibiting function is from the acid box and D1 both bi nding D2 in a location that includes the HBS. This prevents excessive FGFR1 activa tion by inhibiting heparin binding in the HBS, a prerequisite for receptor binding [ 303]. A single transmembrane helix connects the extracellular domain with tyrosi ne intracellular domain. A.1.3 splici ng isoforms A variety of isoforms exist for FGFR1 as a result of alternative splicing. One such event occurs in the region encoding the out er domain, D1, of FG FR1- FGFR3. This generates two versions of thes e receptors. One version c ontains all three domains, while the other contains only D2 and D3. Receptors with only D2 and D3 are referred to as the (beta) isoform. Those with all 3 domains are called the (alpha) isoform. Regardless of whether the outer domain is present in the molecule, each isoform is Figure A.1: Schematic diagram of fibroblas t growth factor receptors. D1,D2, and D3 represent immunoglobulin-like domain s 1,2, and 3. S represents the signal peptide; AB represents the acid box; TM represents the transmembrane helix; TK1 and TK2 represents the split-kinase dom ain, which is interrupted by the kinase insert; J represents the juxtamembrane region. The heparin-binding site in D2 is marked by a thick black line. The alaternatively spliced region (encode by either exon \"b\" or \"c\" in FGFR1-3)_in D3 is represented by a thick grey line. (Adapted from Ibrahimi et al.[3] 116 capable of activating their tyrosine kinase doma in within the cell interior. The reason this occurs is that the FGF bind ing site is located in D2. This is supported by numerous FGFR1-FGF crystal structure complexes [9 , 79, 307]. A second alternative splicing event in FGFR1-FGFR3 occurs in the C-term inal portion of D3. This event generates receptors that differ in the 2nd half of D3 with alternative ex ons (IIIb and IIIc). Regardless of which one is present in the encoded protein, t hey are always spliced into the exon encoding the 1st half of D3 (IIIa). A.1.4 Activation and dimerization The work by Amaya et al. and Ueno et al. showed FGFR1 molecules must dimerize in order to propagate a signal toward s the cellular interior [308, 309]. The reason this occurs is that the dimerizati on juxtaposes the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains allowing them to transphosphorylate each other, transmitting signal into the cell. Since this discovery, the mechanism of signal generation in the cell by ligand induced receptor activation has been the s ource of great controversy and how and why the receptors dimerize have been explained with, at times, conflicting models. The earliest model showed that re ceptor dimerization was driven by a dimer of FGF that was facilitated and stabilized by heparin [92]. The FGF dimers, in turn, facilitated receptor dimerization. There was no detection of contact between FGFR1 and heparin. A year later a heparin binding site was di scovered in FGFR1. Mutations in this region resulted in loss of FGF binding activity [310]. This work led to the first ternary model of FGFR1 activation indicating t hat interaction of all three components simultaneously was required for tyrosine ki nase activity. Additional experiments suggested that direct contact between eac h FGFR1 molecule was involved in the dimerization process [311]. A model based on these findings proposed that a heparin and FGFR1 form a complex prior to FGF bindi ng. Here in this model, a heparin FGFR1 monomers forming an inactive dimer. The dimer is activated by the binding of two FGF molecules. Note, this model is di fferent than the prior model. In the prior model only FGF dimers are responsible for dimerization. In this model, heparin spans and stabilizes two FGFR1 monomers forming an FGFR1 dimer, which may be activated with the binding of two FGF ligands. This re sults in an active 2: 2 FGF-FGFR1 dimer. 117 A.1.5 Dimerization models by crystallography Through the use of X-ray crystallography, the initial crystal st ructure of FGFR1 was solved and others soon follo wed [78, 79, 312-314]. Quickly, the structure of FGFR1 and FGF with and without heparin became known. Undoubtedly, this was facilitated by production and purification of only the extracellular doma in of FGFR1, the portion responsible for ligand binding and signal trans mittance into the cell [303]. Inaugural structural insight into the mechanism of dimer formation occurr ed with the crystal structure of a FGFR1-FGF complex in the absence of heparin [307]. This complex is formed by two FGF:FGFR1 m onomers. The complex has 2-fold symmetry and is stabilized by both intra- and intermolecul ar interactions between an FGF:FGFR1 monomer. Several sulfate ions were observ ed within a positively charged channel which connects the outer portions of each monomer . This was predicted to be the heparin binding site. Two additional crystal struct ures proved the pr ediction was true, that the channel was indeed the binding site. One was prepar ed by incubating the previously solved Figure A.2: A top and side view repr esentation of the crystal structure of 2:2:2 ter nary complex of heparin, FGFR1, and FGF (RSCB 1FQ9). Although was used for crystallization, only 6 monosaccharides were visible (light blue spheres). A dimer of FGFR:FGF is shown as electron density. Two FGF monomers are colored blue and pink and two FGFR1 monomers are colored green and grey. FGFR1 domains 2 and 3 are denoted as D2 and D3 respectively (Figure adapted from Schlessinger et al. [9] 118 FGF-FGFR1 crystals in a solution contai ning a heparin decasaccharide. A second crystal was created by co-crystallizing FG F, FGFR1, and heparin. Although both were prepared different, very similar structures re sulted. Each revealed two oligosaccharides within the canyon whose binding was facilitated by electrostatic interaction with basic residues and numerous hydrogen bonds wit h polar residues (Fig. A.2). A.1.6 AAV-2 and FGFR1 binding AAV-2's ability to infect cells is similar to many other virus s pecies. It first is localized to the cell surface by binding an a ttachment (primary) re ceptor, heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) but requires the presence of a co-receptor for in fection. Five co- receptors have been proposed to date for AAV-2: FGFR1, the 36/67 kDa and integrins v1 and v5. There are other many reasons to allow spec ulation of a co-receptor playing a role in AAV-2 infection that is of more subst ance than the mere general observation that many virus species require co-receptors. Conjecture about AAV-2 and FGFR1 binding was initially fueled by a significant variabilit y in AAV2's capacity to infect cells. A study by Ponnazhagain et al. allowed recombinant AAV-2 to infect CD34+, hematopoietic progenitor cells that are derived from bone marro w [315]. These cells ha ve the ability of multi-lineage differentiation. It was found that transduction occurred in approximately 15 to 80% of half of the donor cells. T he remaining 50% showed no transduction. However, transduction could be enhanced if gr owth factors were added. These growth factors facilitate the di fferentiation of the progenitor cells into various lineages such as erythroid, myeloid, or lymphoid cells [316]. The maturation of CD34+ cells into different lineages results from expressi on of different proteins. The permissive transduction of some cells is likely due to expression of the correct co-receptor in some of these cells. Additional data implicating a co-receptor was required for infection came from Qing, et al. [51]. This study was built upon the preliminary study by Summerford et al. who showed that heparin sulf ate proteoglycan is a receptor for AAV-2. [47]. A decade before Summerford's study, it was shown that FGF binds to cells through HSPG and a second receptor, which was later identified as FGFR1 [288, 303]. In the study of Qing et al. it was hypothesized that AAV-2 binds to the cell surface similar to FGF in that HSPG 119 functions for initial attachment to the ce ll surface but infection is directed by the presence of FGFR1. To test this, a comparative analysis was performed between AAV-2 and FGF. Here, they measured the binding of FGF and AAV-2 to two cell lines. One was known to be permissive for FGF and AAV-2 binding while the other was not. In an additional experiment, the authors measured binding to the non-permissive cells after they were transfected with a plasmid encoding HSPG and/or FGFR1. This tested whether production of receptor could in crease binding. The result s showed a strikingly similar binding profile between FGF and AAV-2. Each could not bind to the non-permissive cells. However, if these cells were trans fected with plasmids for HSPG and FGFR1, binding was equal to the permissive cell line. In a third experiment by Qing et al., it was shown that AAV-2 binding to a permissive cell line could be inhibited with the addition of FGF, but not the epidermal growth factor (EGF). Together , these results indicate that cell infection by AAV-2 is mediated through HSPG and FGFR1. In 2006, Lochrie et al. performed a mut agenic study on surface exposed residues of AAV-2 [5]. Mutants were tested for their ability to bind heparin and in vitro transduction. In addition to verifying prior mutagenic studi es of Kern and Opie et al., they found a group of amino acids that if mutated maintained their ability to bind heparin but transduced cells <10% of wild type. They concluded a region of the viral surface, the \"dead zone\", was an area that is responsible for co-receptor binding. It is near the 2-fold dimple and adjacent the heparin binding site along the three fold peaks. Lochrie et al. hypothesized based on the proximity of the dead zones to heparin and the size Figure A.3: Docking of a fibrobla st growth factor receptor 1/basic fibroblast growth factor/heparin complex into the dimple. The receptor complex is shown in the wire frame format, a cropped virus is shown as colored spheres: red, acidic amino acid; blue, basic; yellow, polar; and gray, hydrophobic. (Figure from Lochrie et al.[5]) 120 of the dimple, which is large enough to accommodate two Ig-like domains of FGFR, that FGFR may bind at the dead zone over the 2-fold dimple. In a docking experiment, they docked the crystal structure (RSC B entry 1FQ9) into the dimple on the viral surface (Fig. A.3). In 2008, Belur et al. presented additional evidence that FGFR1 was a co-receptor for AAV-2 [317]. In this study, mice were injected with a recombinant AAV-2 vector into Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Purkinje cells are the largest of the neuronal cell types in the cerebellum and are responsible for the transmission of information between the cerebellum and other areas of the brian [317]. The rAAV-2 vector contained a Green Fluoresence Protein (GFP) reporter gene, which would fluoresce if expressed through transduction. These cells had previously been shown to be permissive for AAV2 vector transduction. 30 minutes prio r to vector administration, one side of the cerebellum received pre-treatment injections of anti- FGFR1 antibody while its counterpart half received a placebo injection of either PBS so lution or a control antibody that was not specific for FGFR1. After a certain per iod, each left and right side halves were compared with one another. T he half which received the anti-FGFR1 antibody pre- treatment had ~10X fewer transduced cells. Th is study lends further support for AAV-2 using FGFR1 as a co-receptor for infection. A.1.7 Stoichiometry of FGFR1 binding The icosahedral symmetry of AAV-2 permits 60 possible binding sites per capsid. However, it is likely that not all 60 binding sites will be available due to steric hindrance between two neighboring FGFR1 molecules. This plays an important role in correctly Figure A.4: A hypothetical scenario showing how steric hindrance between neighboring receptors may not allow full (60-fold) decoration. A) A semi-transparent cryo-EM map. Solid lines denote symmetry axes. The view is down the 5-fold. B) Electron density of 5 FGFR1 receptors (RSCB entry 1FQ9) were docked onto the surface in relative equivalent positions around the 5-fold vertex. Overlap can be seen between each receptor, which would prevent full decoration. 121 incubating the correct stoichiometric rati o of virus and receptor. A simple docking graphic is instructive and one is shown in figure A.4. In this figure, five copies of the FGFR1 crystal structure (RSCB entry 1FQ9) were docked onto the outer surface of a cryo-EM map of AAV-2 in approximately equal pos itions relative to the capsid surface. The crystal structure is a ternary complex containing domains D2 and D3 of FGFR1 bound with FGF and heparin. Note that this is a hypothetical scenario. The purpose of this figure is to show the dimensions of FGFR1 relative to the surface of AAV-2 and how steric hindrance may play a role in preventing FGFR1 from binding to all receptor binding sites on the viral su rface. The figure is not intended to suggest how FGFR1 binds to AAV-2. In order for there to be 60 FGFR1's attached to the virus capsid, the binding of one receptor must not block symme try related binding sites. Blocking could result from an excessively large receptor or closely juxtaposed bi nding sites. The top panel of the figure shows a view down the 5-fo ld axis of a semi-transparent AAV-2 map. In the bottom panel, the view is also down the 5-fold axis but now there are 5 receptors docked into equivalent locations on the vira l surface. Here, there is overlap between neighboring receptors, which is likely to prevent atta chment of two receptors juxtaposed. A real example of steric hindrance preventing full 60-fold decoration with a molecule is given by Kauffmann et al [207] . Here, the minute virus of mice (MVM) was bound with Fab. A Fab is an ~50kDa cleaved portion of an antibody that binds to the virus. The Fab bound at a position on the vi ral surface near the 3-fold axis of symmetry,which prevented the binding of 3-fo ld equivalent neighbor s. The strength of the Fab density in the reconstruction indica ted only 20 Fabs bound per virion. This is because there are 20 3- folds per virus. A.2 Materials and Methods A.2.1 Virus and receptor A.2.1.1 Virus. Virus was produced and purified according to the protocol of Xie et al. [190]. For imaging, the virus was dialyzed out of the cesium chloride solution and into a low salt buffer (125 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, and 1 mM MgCl 2 pH 7.5) using 50 l custom- built microdialysis cells. 122 A.2.1.2 Receptor. The receptor was purchased as a recombinant protein construct containing either 2 or 3 extracellular domains fused to a human (Fc) domain (Fig. A.5). Most of the data reported her e is with the alpha form of FGFR1(IIIc) containing all three domains (Sigma Cat #F9174). For the cryo-EM imaging, the beta form of FGFR1(IIIc) was tested (Sigma Cat#F9299). All constructs from the manufacturer were initially in the form of a lyophilized powder. For negative staining, the FGFR11 (IIIc) construct was resuspended into a PBS solution (pH 7.5) as suggested by the manufacturer to a concentration of 2 g/l. For cryo-EM imaging, the receptor was resuspended into 25mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150mM NaCl to a concentration of 2 g/l. A.2.2 Direct Visualization Solutions containing virus and FGFR1 were mixed together with and without heparin and allowed to incubate for up to 24hours. The virus concentration suitable for imaging was determined empirically and adj usted to be approximately ~2.5 g/l. This concentration reconciles conflicting requirements, the need for adequate particle numbers in an image and the need to be frugal with low quantity of FGFR1 available. Many methods were used to prepare a complex. They are described below in the order of wh ich they were performed. A.2.2.1 Grid application method. In this protocol, virus was applied to an EM grid containing a thin, continuous carbon layer (Fig A.6). The virus was allowed to adhere for 1 min. Excess solution was blotted off with a Whatman #542 filter paper until no excess was visible on the grid. A 3ul receptor solu tion contain FGFR1 was applied to the grid and allowed to bind the virus for 1 min and the excess was blotted off. To test whether heparin was required for bindi ng, FGFR1 was pre-mixed wit h heparin and applied done previously. A stoichiometric ratio of 60:60:1 (heparin:FGF R1:AAV-2) was used. Figure A.5: A schematic diagram of the FGFR-Fc construct used to prepare complexes. The alpha isoform is shown here with Ig-like domains Ig1, Ig2, and Ig3. They are fused to the constant domain (Fc) of a human Immunoglobulin. (Adapted from Anderson et al. [7] 123 A.2.2.2 Incubation in a micr ocentrifuge tube method. The \"grid application\" method generated a high degree of background staining which could be from the resuspended lyophilized FGFR1 construct (see results below ), which was at a high ratio of 60:1 (FGFR1:AAV-2). To test this, AAV-2 and FGFR1 were incubated with and without heparin for either an hour or 24 hours in a microcentrifuge tube before being applied to the grid. The receptor to virus ratio was 10: 1. The idea here is that by using a lower concentration of FGFR as well as not applying the FGFR1 solution directly to the grid, the background noise could be reduced. In addition, this method also tested for the effects of a longer incubation period. Here in this incubation, FGFR1 and AAV- 2 were mixed together at a reduced ratio of 10:1, receptors per virion. W hen heparin was included, a ratio of 10:10:1 (heparin:FGFR1:AAV-2) was used. The mixtur e was allowed to in cubate for either an hour or overnight. The solution was then negatively stained and imaged with an electron microscope. A.2.2.3 Incubation on an EM grid method. It is has been observed in preliminary experiments that incubating AAV-2 with hepari n causes a significant decrease in the concentration of AAV-2 due to aggregation. This was first observed when attempting to prepare AAV-2-heparin complexes for cryo-E M imaging (see chapter 4). In the above incubation method (\"Incubation in a micr of the \"grid applic ation method\". Virus is applied to an EM grid, allowed to sit for 1 minute, the excess is blotted off and a solution containing recept or(s) is added. In this figure, both FGFR and heparin are shown being added simultaneously. When not testing heparin's role in complex formation, only FGFR is added. The receptor is allowed to incubate with vi rus for one minute and the excess is blotted off. 124 induce a similar effect. There was a signifi cant decrease in the number of visible particles. To avoid this, a novel incubation strategy was developed whereby the incubation was performed on the grid itsel f. Figure A.7 shows a schematic outline. In this method, a 6 l droplet containing either FGFR1 or FG FR1 and heparin is placed on a piece of parafilm located inside a petridish. Underneath t he parafilm is a wetted piece of filter paper, which helps maintain humid environment and prevent evaporation of the droplet. 3l of viral solution is added onto an EM grid and blotted to remove excess. It is then placed sample-side down on the droplet. The petri dish is covered and sealed with parafilm. The idea behind this is to immob ilize virus onto the grid where may still incubate with heparin and FGFR but cannot bind to other virus where it could aggregate. This method of incubation has two negative aspects. First, not all of the virus particles adhere to the grid . The percentage of particles that fall off depend on the duration of incubation. Inc ubation of an hour does not lend a noticeable amount from falling off. For extended in cubations of up to 24 hours, between 25 and 50% of the original particles number remain adhered. The second negative aspect is a large degr ee of uncertainty in whether the correct stoichiometry of receptor(s) and virus is achieved. This is because most of the virus particles are blotted off leaving only a very small and unknown fraction left on the Figure A.7: A diagram of the \"incubation on an EM grid method\". A) A sc hematic representation of the method. Virus is added to an EM grid and the excess is blotted off. The EM grid is then plac ed onto a droplet c ontaining receptor(s) with the virus facing the solution. B) A picture of a grid incubating on a droplet. This method allows AAV-2 to incubate in a heparin-containing solution without aggregating since AAV-2 is immobilized onto the grid. 125 grid. If the quantity of receptor(s) in the droplet was calculated based on the numbers in the entire 3 l droplet, then a greater than desired excess of receptors will be added. This tends to increase the background noise level with the presence of non-bound receptors and creates ambiguous interpretati on of whether a receptor is attached or merely in close vicinity. (This applies to the \"grid application\" method too. Correction for this was only tested in this incubation method) In an attempt to more a ccurately mix stoichiometric amounts of virus and receptor, the number of virus particles in a single 2K X 2K image at a given magnification and pixel size was counted. Th is was used to calculate the number of particles on the entire grid. The receptor concentration wit hin the drop was recalculated to reflect this number of parti cles which were present on the grid after blotting. This required ~1000X dilution of the receptor containing solution. Because in the previous methods there were greater than expected background staining from the PBS solution, the receptor solution was diluted into a buffer containing 25mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150mM NaCl. A.2.3 Negative staining and Imaging After the incubation period, the samp le was negatively stained. Here, a 3 l volume of the sample was applied to a cont inuous carbon grid and was allowed to bind for 1min. Excess sample was blotted off, 3ul of 1% uranyl acetate solution was added and allowed to sit for 1min. bef ore the grid was again blotted to remove excess solution. The grids were then imaged on a Phillips CM 120 at 120keV. Controls were negatively stained AAV-2 by itse lf and bound with heparin. A.2.4 Cryo-EM A.2.4.1. Sample preparation. The receptor isoform tested wa s the beta FGFR1 (IIIc) (2 Ig-like domains). Samples were prepared from overnight incubations of virus with FGFR1-Fc from the \"microc entrifuge tube incubation\". The vitrification process was perform ed with a Vitrobot (see chapter 2 for protocol and diagram). Briefly, a 3 l virus-FGFR1 solution was applied onto a holey carbon grid (C-flat) with 2 m hole size and 1 m spacing. The sample grid was doubled blotted in 100% humidity for 2.5 sec. and plunged into liquid ethane. Grids were transferred into liquid nitrogen for long term storage. 126 A.2.4.2 Imaging. Imaging was performed on a Phill ips CM300 FEG and collected with a 4K X 4K CCD camera at 100KeV at va rious magnifications and defocus levels, generally between 1 m and 6 m. A.3 Results A.3.1 Negative staining A.3.1.1 Grid application method. Control images of AAV-2 and heparin-AAV-2 in any method of incubation appeared similar (Figures A.8). In general, all of the particles appeared to be intact and readily visualized with good contrast. Nearly all particles have a black ring surrounding its shell from an accumulation of stain. This is common in negatively stained samples of AAV-2. Often, a few broken particles are visible in each image with some being more obvious than others. Many broken particles have the appearance of a \"pac man\" shape. These are also seen in vitrified samples, although to a lesser extent. The cause of this increased incidence remains unknown but could be from dehydration from the staining process. A diagnostic aid to discriminate less obvious broken particles from those intact is that broken particles often have a dark center in the viral capsid from stain filling the interior of the shell. In some images, sm all circular particulates may be visible Figure A.8: Control images of negatively stained AAV-2 and heparin- AAV-2. There is no observable difference between the two images. Particles in each have a dark circular ring along the periphery due to accumulation of stain. Magnificati ons are different in each image. 127 Figure A.9: Images of negatively stained AAV-2 and FGFR1 with and without heparin from the \"Grid application\" method. Here, virus was applied onto an EM grid, blotted to remove excess, and a receptor solution was added on top. As in figure 8, negativ ely stained AAV-2 particles generally have a dark symmetrical circle around them from an accumulation of stain. A) AAV-2 with a 600-fold excess of FGFR (relative to virion). Free (non-bound) FGFR can be seen in the background and appear as white and elongated pieces of density. The background noise makes it difficult to determine with certainty whether a receptor is attached to a virus or merely in the vi cinity. B) AAV-2 with a 600 fold excess of FGFR and heparin (relative to virion). A virus particle is high lighted with a black box, which is shown magnified in panel C for clarity. C) The area with the black box in panel B. The virus appears to have a small piece of white density attached and sticking out radially from t he viral surface. Uranyl ac etate stain (dark areas) has accumulated around the attached white density. The size of the white densit y is approximate to the size of an attached FGFR in one of many possible orie ntations (see Fig10. for a relative scale of FGFR and AAV-2). However, dehydration artifacts and the large number of possible FGFR orientations allow a significant range in the visibility of an attached FGFR. In favorable orientations, the FGFR could be sticking out radially in the plane of the image. In unfavorable orientations, it could be completely masked by the virus. These images are representative of t hose collected in that some areas of the image are completely dark while in other areas it appears to be nearly stain free. When the stain is intermittent between the two, both virions and receptors are visible. 128 (arrowhead, A.12A). They are variable in size and shape. On average, it is generally \u00bc the size of the viral capsid in projection A.3.1.2 Receptor-virus images. In the images, there were visible AAV-2 particles and elongated white features which were not found in the control images (Fig. A.9). The size of the white features is approximately the same size as FGFR1 (Fig A.10). These are attributed as FGFR1 molecules. There are many FGFR1 molecules in the background of the image that are not attached to any AAV-2 particles. Some AAV- 2 particles appear to have one or two FGFR1 molecules attached. There is also a significantly greater level of background stain as compared to the control images. Some areas were overly stained and completely opaque while others appeared to be stain free. This correlated into a fraction of the grid with an appropriate level of staining suitable to visualize virus particles. This variation is due to two reasons. One reason is the form ation of uranyl salts from the PBS solution. The second reason could be from the solution of the resuspended lyophilized FGFR1 solution. These tend to be impure and rich with background debris, which makes negative staining images difficult to interpret. (D. Taylor, personal communication). Additionally, this solution was applied directly to the carbon grid itse lf where it may adhere Figure A.10: The relative sizes of AAV-2 and the FGFR1 constructs used in this study. This picture is not intended to depict a particular orientation of binding. In black and white is a native cryo-EM reconstruction of AAV-2 (described in chapter 4). Shown above are electron density representations of the crystal structures of the Fc regions of an IgG antibody (RSCB entry 1t83, blue and light blue) and the extracellular Ig-like domains D2 & D3 of FGFR1 (RSCB entry 1fq9, red and pink). The Fc region is composed of two monomers that are held together by a disulfide bond. Each of the monomers of the Fc regions are linked to an FGFR monomer (red and pink) through a polypeptide linker (not shown). Each FGFR monomer contains only the extracellular domains D2 and D3. Dashed circles represent domain D1 of FGFR1, which is disordered in the crystal structure of FGFR1. 129 Figure A.11: An image of a negatively st ained sample from the \"incubation in microcentrifuge tube\" method. In this method of incubation, virus and FGFR were allowed to mi x in a microcentrifuge tube overnight before applying to a grid and negatively stained. This image shows the irregu lar staining patterns and the shape of FGFR which is near the vicinity of the viral capsid. Most particles in the im age have been highlighted with a black box and labeled with a number. A magnified image of these boxed particles are sh own around the periphery of the central image with their corresponding number. The features in each of the magni fied image are not the same amongst each other. Near some of the magnified images, arrows point to areas arou nd the viral surface that appear to have additional white density in the vicinity. In majority of these images there is asymmetric staining around the periphery of the virus, which is different for each magnified image. In some area s of stain, there is whit e density that appears to be attached to the viral surface. In additio n to the staining, the whit e density has an irregular shape that varies between all the images. This could be due to either dehydration arti facts, unattached FGFR which is laying on the grid in random orientations, or attached to the virus but has some disorder and flexibility such that distal regions of the receptor move around. 130 to the carbon substrate during the incubation process. A second cont ributor to the noise was an excessive background level of non-bound FGFR1. When the level of staining was appropriate to visualize virus particles , the non-bound FGFR1 particles were readily visible too. This was likely due to the 60:1 ratio of receptor to AAV-2. It is difficult to draw conclusions regar ding receptor binding as it was unclear whether a virus particle had an FGFR1 rec eptor bound or whether one was close but unattached. Supporting evidence that a recept or was attached is in an observable different staining pattern around some particles. This staining pattern was not seen in control images. In these images, the staining pattern was of a th in circle directly around the virus perimeter. In many of the virus-receptor particles there was often an excess of stain located on one side of the particle, whic h could be from an accumulation of stain around an attached FGFR1 (Fig. A.9C). In the images there were many particles with clearly nothing bound to the virus particles. This could be due to a few reasons . One reason is that there are simply no receptors binding. The second reason is that the receptor is bound but is screened from the virus particle itself. For example, if the re ceptor is sticking out into the direction of the viewer, the receptor density could be masked by underlying capsid density. A.3.1.3 Incubation in mi crocentrifuge method. Images were noticeably cleaner with significantly less background noise from staining (Fig. A.11). The decrease in background noise is probably due to the fact that the resu spended lyophilized solution is not being added to the carbon grid directly. Also, a lower rec eptor:virus ratio of 10:1 was used, previously it was 60:1. The better staining allowed many more particles to be analyzed for receptor binding. However, similar conclusions were m ade regarding receptor binding in that confidence in binding was low due to high background level of non-bound FGFR1 despite using a stoichiometry of 10:1, receptor to virus. When heparin was incubated with FGFR1 and virus, there were very few particles which could be imaged. Thus, if heparin played a role, there was an insufficient number of particles that could be visualized (data not shown). This heparin- induced aggregation warranted t he development of a third inc ubation protocol to allow mixing and imaging of all three. 131 Figure A.12: Images of negatively stained samples from the \"incubation on grid\" method. In this method, AAV-2 was pre-adhered to an EM grid and then allowed to incubate with either FGFR1 or FGFR1/heparin. Both incubations were held overnight with a virus:receptor ration of 1:10 relative to virus par ticle. In the samples that were imaged here, the amount of receptor in the drople t was dependent on the number of virus present on the grid after blotting and not the amount that was present before blotting. To reduce the concentration of receptor in the droplet, the receptor solution was diluted ~1000X into a Tris buffer. A) A control image containing only AAV-2. Arrowheads point to background contaminants from either the viral prep or broken capsids. B) An image of AAV-2 with FGFR1. The quality of this image appears signific antly better than those shown previously in Figs A.9 and A.11. This is likely due to the Tris buffer that was us ed for the incubation. Both PBS and resuspended lyophilized solutions often contribute to increased background noise in uranyl acetate stained samp les. A red arrow points to a broken capsid. Some virus particles are highlighted wi th a black arrow and identified with a number. The area within each highlighted square is shown in C. C) M agnified squares in B. The number next to each image corresponds to each numbered box in B. Black arrows in Images 1-4 point to extra density near the viral capsid which could be due to attached FGFR. In Images 5 and 6, no extra density can be seen attached to the capsid. 132 A.3.1.4 Incubation on grid method. In this method there were two different calculations used to estimate the number of virus particles adhered to the grid for incubation. The first did not take into consid eration the decrease in virus particle number which occurs when the excess sample is bl otted off. The second used a calculation based on the number of particles adhered onto the grid after blotting. In this method the control images of only AAV-2 and AAV-2 with heparin were similar to that shown previously (Fig. A.8A , A.8B, A.12A). Particles appeared intact and gave us confidence that this method of incubat ion did not affect the capsid integrity and could be used to test for binding. When the entire 3 l viral solution was used to calculate the number of receptors to add, there was a greater level of noise si milar to that seen in figure A.9. However, conclusions with regards to binding are similar to other incubation schemes, there is no clear evidence one way or another that the FGFR1 construct was binding AAV-2. While some particles appeared bound with extra densit y many did not. It does not appear that heparin influences binding, since the same observation and ambiguity exists in those images. When the decrease in virus quantity on the grid after blotting was taken into consideration upon calculating the quantity of receptor, im age quality was significantly better than all prior methods (Figure A. 12B and A.12C). There was lower background noise from over staining and uranyl salts as well as fewer non-bound receptor. The lower level of background noise could be due to the dilution of PBS solution. A.3.2 Cryo EM Images showed virus particles that were crisp and distinct (Fig. A13). Many images were acquired to ascertain a sufficient number of particles for assessment of receptor binding. Scattered in the backgroun d of the image are small elongated pieces of black density which are of similar size as the white pieces of density in the images from the negative staining experiments. These are at tributed as non-bound FGFR molecules. The reversal in contrast is due to the two different me thodologies in sample preparation. Images of negat ive stained samples show an outline of the biological object from an accumulation of negative stai n. More electrons penetrate through the sample than around the perimeter. Thus, aro und the perimeter wher e there are few 133 electrons being transmitted, the color in the image is black and where the object is located, the is a brighter color. In ice-embedded sample s, there is no negative stain around the perimeter of the particles. The only thing that prevents some electrons from being transmitted are objects within the ice that are dens e enough to interfere with the electrons. Since the biological objects in the sample scatter more electrons than the ice, the object looks darker. In the experimental image there was a greater background level of noise present in the images that is likely from excess of non-bound FGFR1.There was no clear evidence of binding. Again, similar to t he negative staining imag es there were some particles which appeared to have extra density bound to its shell, while many did not. Figure A.13: Images of vitrified AAV-2 a fter an incubation period with and without FGFR-1. In this figure, the virus particles now appear dark with a faint white outline arou nd the perimeter from the Fresnel fringes. These images now have contrast reversal than those shown in Figs 7, 8, and 9 which were of images of virus particles that had density colored white. Both images in this figure were low passed to 30\u00c5 to enhance contrast. A) A control image of only AAV-2. The virus particles appear distinctly polyhedral. B) An image of AAV-2 incubated with FGFR1 overnight at a ratio of 10:1, recept ors per virion. The dashed line denotes the edge of the hole. The background level of noise in the image is signific antly greater than that in A. In B, t he background noise is mainly contributed by dark, elongated spots which are similar in size to the attached white pieces of density in Figs 7, 8, and 9. These spots are not found in panel A and are excess FGFR molecules. 134 A.4 Conclusions A.4.1 Results AAV-2 and FGFR1 were allowed to incubat e and were subsequently imaged in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Addi tionally, a 17kDa fragment of heparin was also tested to see if it played a role in complex formation. In the first method of incubation (\"grid application method\"), AAV-2 was immobilized on a grid, the excess was blotted, and a receptor-containing solution was added on top. In one grid, the receptor containing solution had only FGFR1. In another grid, the receptor-containing solution had both FGFR1 and heparin. Images from this method allowed ambiguous interpretation due to an excessive leve l of background noise from non-bound FGFR molecules. Many virus particles appeared to have an attached white piece of density that is approximate to the ex pected size based on the crystal structure of both parts of the FGFR construct (the two Ig-like extracellu lar domains of FGFR1 and the Fc portion). The concentration and proximity of non-bound receptor made the interpretation less certain. The addition of heparin did not make an observable difference. It was thought that lowering the concentration of receptor and extending the in cubation duration could enhance visualization. A second method of incubation was the \"Incubation in microcentrifuge method\". In this method, FGFR and AAV-2 were allowed to incubate at a stoichiometry of 10:1 for either an hour or overnight. In images of these samples the background noise was less. However, there was still a significant am ount of non-bound FGFR in the images and interpreting between bound and non-bound was difficult. When heparin was added to the incubation, few particles were visible in the images and it appeared a majority had been pulled out of solution. This is likely due to precipitation of AAV-2 from heparin, which has been seen before whil e trying to prepare AAV-2 and heparin complexes. An alternative method was needed to test for heparin. A third incubation scheme was developed. Here, AAV-2 was pre-adhered to an EM grid, blotted to remove excess and was inverted onto a droplet containing either FGFR or FGFR and heparin. With this meth od, the immobilized virus was free to interact with the receptors in the solution and was unlikely to bind other virus particles. 135 The stoichiometry of receptor to virus was 10:10:1 (FGFR:heparin :AAV-2). The results from this incubation were similar to the se cond method of incubation in that the images were better with less background noise and ambiguous interpretation between bound and non-bound FGFR. To further reduce the leve l of non-bound FGFR, the concent ration of receptors in the droplets was reduced to account for only t he amount of virus particles that remained attached to the grid after the excess was blotted off. The stoichiometry remained 10:10:1 (FGFR:heparin:AAV-2). In these images the quality was significantly better than all prior methods. There was lower background noise from over staining as there were fewer non-bound receptor. However, conclusions with regards to binding are similar to previous virus receptor images. While so me particles appeared bound with extra density many did not. It is unknown whether heparin influences binding, since the same observation and ambiguity exists in those images. An alternative method of visualizati on was to observe ice-embedded samples. The purpose of this was to image AAV-2 and FG FR without any supporting material. While much of the background noise from the supporting material was removed, it remained difficult to determine if a receptor was attached. A.4.2 Interpretation The aforementioned results may be inte rpreted ambiguously, in that the formation of a complex between FGFR and AAV- 2 cannot be confirmed or denied. What do we know from previous cryo-EM studies? It is commonly seen in micrographs of ice embedded virus and Fab complexes, many vi rus particles with numerous molecules sticking out radially from the viral surface [69, 207, 318]. The reason multiple Fabs can be seen as opposed to just a single Fab is because of the icosahedral symmetry within the virus. The symmetry allows up to 60 possible binding sites on the suface of the capsid. When a virus particle has all of the binding sites occupied by a molecule, many of these molecules will be sticking out ortho gonal to the viewing direction and will not be obstructed by the capsid density. However, not all receptor binding sites may be equal. In a recent cryo-EM study of the canine parvovirus, it was proposed t hat not all of its 60 binding sites have the capacity to bind its cellular receptor [319, 320]. In this study, ra ther than observing 136 numerous receptors attached to the viral ca psid, the authors could only observe one or a few. They proposed that a special unique vertex in the icosahedral shell was responsible for receptor binding. How does this translate into the current data? If all 60 binding sites of AAV-2 are occupied by FGFR molecules, it is reasona ble to expect receptor density to be visibly attached to the viral surface regardless of the or ientation of the virus. However, if only one or a few are attached to the virus as s een in the cryo-EM study of CPV, then there will be some orientations wher e the receptor visibility is favorable and others where it will be masked by the virus density. Based on these two scenarios, the amount of attached receptor molecules that could be visible runs the full spectrum of possibilites, from one to many. Our observations follow those seen for the canine par vovirus in that some particles appear to have one or a few FGFR molecules attached while other particles showed no sign of attached receptor. A hint that FGFR is attac hed to the viral surface (or very close) is an asymmetrical staining patte rn around the virus. In control images, negative stain accumulates symmetrically around each virus particle. In the images of FGFR and AAV- 2 samples, some virus particle had exce ss stain on one side, often surrounding an elongated piece of white densit y. These observations suggest that one or a few FGFR molecules are binding or are very close AAV-2 There is a low level of c onfidence in interpretating the images. It is unknown which isoform(s) of FGFR bind AAV-2 . FGFR molecules contain up to 3 Immunoglobulin-like domains in its extrace llular domain and there are many naturally occurring isoforms of FGFR1 due to alternative splicing. These have been discussed previously. Whether AAV-2 uses one isoform for infection over the other is unknown. Another reason to suggest that there is no binding is through a biochemical investigation using an ELIZA, immunoprecip itation, and dot bot analysis which showed no evidence of binding between AAV-2 and FGFR1 ( isoform). The same isoform that was used in the incubation and negative staining was also used in these biochemical assays, which were performed by a pos t-doctoral fellow in the laboratory. 137 A.4.3 Future considerations The observations discussed in this chapter can be used as a guide in the design of future experiments to test for co-recept or binding. A total of 4 genes encode the FGFR family, FGFR1-4. All have naturally occurring isoforms in which the extracellular domains are commercially available in 50 g quantities. It would be interesting to test each one's ability, with and without heparin, to bind AAV-2 through a biochemical assay. This would allow a comparison between all the isoforms. If one shows a greater affinity than the others, additional methods to verify detection may be employed such as those described here. Based on the observations presented in this Appendix, visually observing attached receptor may be more difficult t han expected. Both negatively stained as well as ice embedded samples should be imaged sinc e each has its own set of advantages. Negatively stained samples have greater cont rast and are easier to prepare but are prone to dehydration artifacts and excessive ba ckground noise from the supporting film and stain. On the other hand, ice embedded samples ar e more difficult to see but do not have the support film and this reduces the level of backgr ound noise. Since automated sample preparation has become possible, ice embedded samples of AAV-2 have been routinely produced with an ultr a-thin aqueous film. An adv antage of testing for binding with ice embedded samples is that t hey are vitrified in their nat ive state, preserving their structural integrity. In circ umstances such as this, where the attachment of a receptor may be directed by a single binding site, the di slodging of a receptor due to dehydration artifacts may be more \"costly\" in the diagnosis. For exampl e, if a single attached receptor is dislodged during t he negative staining process, it will appear as if nothing is bound. In contrast, virions with full occupancy of its receptor binding sites can afford the loss of a receptor since many more will remain attached. Since vitrified samples are frozen in their native state, they will not be prone to dehydration artifacts as negative stained samples may. In summary, while the results presented in this appendix were not conclusive they do help formulate a guide for the utilizat ion of TEM in the diagnosis of complex formation. 138 APPENDIX B LICENSE AGREEMENTS ELSEVIER LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS Apr 08, 2009 This is a License Agreement between Jason K O'Donnell (\"You\") and Elsevier (\"Elsevier\") provided by Copyright Clearance Center (\"CCC\").

If full payment is not 156 received on a timely basis, then any license preliminarily granted shall be deemed automatically revoked and shall be void as if never granted. In addition, permission granted is contingent upon author permission, which you MUST obtain, and appropriate credit (see item number 3 for details). If you fail to comply with any material provision of this license, ASM shall be entitled to revoke this license immediately and retain fees paid for the grant of the license. Further, in the event that you breach any of these terms and conditions or any of CCC's Billing and Payment terms and conditions, the license is automatically revoked and shall be void as if never granted. Use of materials as described in a revoked license, as well as any use of the materials beyond the scope of an unrevoked license, may constitute copyright infringement and ASM reserves the right to take any and all action to protect its copyright in the materials. 8. ASM reserves all rights not specifically granted in the combination of (i) the license details provided by you and accepted in the course of this licensing transaction, (ii) these terms and conditions and (iii) CCC's Billing and Payment terms and conditions. 9. ASM makes no representa tions or warranties with respect to the licensed material and adopts on its own behalf the limitations and disclaimers established by CCC on its behalf in its Billing and Payment terms and conditions for this licensing transaction. 10. You hereby indemnify and agree to hold harmless ASM and CCC, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims arising out of your use of the licensed material other than as specifically authorized pursuant to this license. 11. This license is personal to you, but may be assigned or transferred by you to a business associate (or to your employer) if you give prompt written notice of the assignment or transfer to the publisher. No such assignment or transfer shall relieve you of the obligation to pay the designated license fee on a timely basis (although payment by the identified assignee can fulfill your obligation). 12.
