Statement of Purpose of Campbell University I. Campbell University is a university of the liberal arts, sciences, and professions which is committed to helping students de velop an integrated Christian personality characterized by a wholeness of body, mind and spirit that includes a method of critical judgment; an appreciation of th e intellectual, cultural, and religious heritage; stewardship of the body; and a sensitive awareness of the world and society in which they live and work with persons. II. Campbell University is a Baptist univers ity affiliated with the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina. Both in a nd out of the classroom, the University endeavors to present Christian principles to students and to foster their application to daily life. III. The purpose of Campbell University arises out of three basic theological and Biblical presuppositions: learning is appoi nted and conserved by God as essential to the fulfillment of human destiny; in Ch rist all things consist and find ultimate unity; and the Kingdom of God in this worl d is rooted and grounded in Christian community. IV. Therefore, the mission of Campbell University, as a community of Christian scholars, is to A. provide students with a Christian world view; B. bring the word of God, mind of Christ, and power of the Spirit to bear in developing moral courage, social sens itivity, and ethical responsibility that will inspire a productive and faithful maturation as individuals and as citizens; C. transfer from one generation to the next the vast body of knowledge and values accumulated over the ages; Campbell University 2007-2009 7 D. encourage creativity, imagination, and rigor in the use of intellectual skills; E. affirm the University's commitment to the belief that truth is never one- dimensional but in wholeness is revela tory, subjective, and transcendent as well as empirical, objective, and rational, and that all truth finds its unity in the mind of Christ; F. frame University teaching in the contex t of a liberal arts education seeking to free persons to live more abundantly and securely in an ever-changing social order; G. foster stewardship in nurturing the gifts of the mind and in developing aesthetic sensibilities; H. equip students with superior vocational skills, productive insights, and professional integrity; I. provide a community of learning that is committed to the pursuit, discovery, and dissemination of knowle dge to serve the region as well as national and international communities; J. prepare students for purposeful lives and Christian service throughout the world through undergraduate, gradua te, and professional instruction including terminal graduate and professional programs; K. provide services to the general community through research efforts, continuing education, cultural enrichment programs, and extended campus education; L. cooperate with other educational in stitutions for the advancement of mankind. V. This university sees the human vocation as living by faith under grace, with no conflict between the life of faith and the life of inquiry. Campus and Buildings The University occupies a spacious 850- acre cam pus in the village of Buies Creek, located in Harnett County, and equidistant from North Carolina's fast-growing metropolitan centers of Raleigh and Fayetteville. The location combines the advantages of accessible urban convenience with the friendly, academic atmosphere of a rural university village. The University had its beginning in a small one-room building erected by local citizens. Though later enlarged by 1896 it had become inadequate to house the growing student body, and additional f acilities were added. On December 20, 1900, with the exception of one building that was later used for classrooms, these structures were destroyed by fire. The burned buildings were replaced by Kivett Hall, named for Z. T. Kivett, the builder; it was constructed between May 23, 1901, and Nove mber 2, 1903. During 1991-1993, Kivett Hall was remodeled to provide additional space for the Norman A. Wiggins School of Law. Other buildings include: William Pears on Hall (1915) renovated 2000, Carrie Rich Memorial Library (1925); D. Rich Memorial Building (1926) renovated 2004; Carter Gymnasium (1952); Leslie Hartwell Campbell Hall of Science (1961); J. Clyde Turner Chapel (1963) renovated 2004; Campbell Home Management House (1965); Fred L. Taylor Hall of Religion (1973); Johnson Memori al Natatorium (1976), Taylor Bott Rogers Fine Arts Center (1984); J.P. Riddle Pharmacy Center (1991); Lundy Fetterman School of Campbell University 2007-2009 8 Business (1999); Pharmacy Research Laboratory (2001); the McLeod Athletic Training Facility (2004); and the Pharmacy Building (2007). In addition, the following serve the administrative function of the University: B. P. Marshbanks Dining Hall (1934); W. S. Britt Hall (1947); John S. Pearson Memorial Student Health Service (1960); James A. Campbell Administration Building (1961); Northeast Hall (1963); Godwin Maintenance Building (1964); and the James M. Shouse Dining Hall (1973). The residence halls for students are: Joel G. Layton Hall (1923); William H. and Lula Bostic Jones Hall (1954); J. E. Kitchin Ha ll (1955); O. Hampton Baldwin Hall (1958); Fred N. Day Hall (1959); Mabel and Nell Powe ll Hall (1960); James E. and Mary Z. Bryan Hall (1961); J. Hunter and Mabel C. Strickla nd Hall (1962); Ernest P. Sauls Hall (1962); Bobby Murray Hall (1967); R. A. and Elsie Hedgpeth Hall (1967); A. R. Burkot Hall (1973); Fred McCall Hall (1973); and Lonni e D. Small Hall (1973); Faculty Memorial Apartments (1999-2000); and Barker Hall (2005). The University also provides more than 250 housing facilities for faculty, staff and graduate students. These are houses, duplexes, and apartments. Some of them are Ellis Memorial Apartments (1957) and East Hall (1969). Brief History Ad astra per aspera Implicit in this old Latin motto, \"To the star s through difficulties,\" adopted during the dark days of post-Reconstruction, are beliefs, aims, and objectives that have guided this institution through ever-changing circumstances. Campbell's rise from a community school of tw enty-one students to eminence as a great southern academy and later to its present st anding among the state's largest church-related senior universities is illustrative of what perseverance can accomplish in scaling the heights. Campbell University was founded January 5, 1887, by James Archibald Campbell, a North Carolina preacher who believed that no student should be denied admission because of lack of funds. Known as Buies Creek Academy, the school that began with twenty-one students grew slowly during the early years. In Campbell College: Big Miracle at Little Buies Creek, (1887-1974), Dr. J. Winston Pearce wrote of Dr. James Archibald Campbell, \"From the beginning, his passion was that his school prepare young men and women for a living and for a life, not one but both. He was concerned that Christ have his way in the classroom and that he have his way in the church house, no difference...\" In 1926, the school attained junior college st atus and changed its name from Buies Creek Academy to Campbell Junior College. In 1961, Campbell became a senior college. The name was changed to Campbell University on June 6, 1979. Campbell University 2007-2009 9 Graduate programs were begun in 1977 with the Master of Education degree. The Master of Business Administration degree was added in 1978, and the Master of Science in Government was established in 1982 (alt hough this degree is no longer offered). The Campbell University School of Law wa s founded in 1976, and the Lundy-Fetterman School of Business was begun in 1983. The Sc hools of Pharmacy and Education were established in 1985. The Divinity School was established in 1995. Campbell University has developed into a majo r university that will enroll nearly 10,000 students during the 2007 academic year. Students hail from all one hundred North Carolina counties, all fifty states of the United States, and over thirty-five countries of the world. Campbell University is now the second largest private university in North Carolina and the second largest Baptist University in the world. Open to all qualified students, Campbell's student body includes persons from more than forty denominations and faiths. In over one hundred years of service, Campbell University has been served by only four presidents: James Archibald Campbell (188 7-1934), Leslie Hartwell Campbell (1934- 1967), Norman Adrian Wiggins (1967-2003), and Jerry McLain Wallace (2003- ). Faculty One of the chief assets of Cam pbell University is its faculty. Members of the faculty are competent, experienced, and dedicated t eachers. Their educational backgrounds are represented by undergraduate a nd graduate degrees from many outstanding institutions. At the present time, over four-fifths of the faculty hold the doctoral degree or its professional equivalent. Campbell University is committed to the task of selecting and maintaining a group of highly qualified teachers who are dedicated to l earning in general, to the special knowledge of their subject area, and to the process of instructing students. Assets The University has total net assets in excess of $226,000,000, including endowment assets in excess of $104,000,000. Also included among its assets is Keith Hills. The first eighteen-hole-course of this championship golf course was completed in 1973, while the second eighteen-hole-course was completed in 2002. Keith Hills is named for its longtime trustee and his family, Fred R. Keith, of Lumberton, North Carolina. The Robin Whitley Hood family of Benson, North Carolina, made possible the building of the Robin Hood Pro Shop. Library The original Carrie Rich Memorial Library ( 1925) has been expanded several times, with the most recent addition completed in 1965. The mission of the library is to provide services and resources to meet the present and fu ture scholarly and informational needs of the Campbell University community and, insofar as possible, to share resources with those outside the University. The library's collection consists of over 230,000 book volumes, 520 print serial subscriptions, over 11,500 electronic periodical subscriptions, and more than 1,000,000 microforms.

When the participation requested pertains to student progress in the major a nd/or minor, such participation becomes a requirement for graduation. IV. Satisfy the Campbell University Worship (CUW) attendance requirement. Campbell University Worship reflects the Christian mission and purpose of Campbell University by offering the opportunity for students to engage in Christian worship, theological reflection, and co mmunity-building experiences. Attendance requirements for CUW are as follows: Students entering as freshmen will attend for four semesters (CUW 100 during the first two semesters and two additional semesters of CUW 200) Students entering as sophomores (24 semester hours) will attend CUW 200 for three semesters Students entering as juniors (64 semester hours) will attend CUW 200 for two semesters Students entering as seniors (98 semester hours) will attend CUW 200 for one semester Students who are seeking an Associate degree will attend for two semesters (CUW 100 during the first two semesters) One-half hour credit is awarded for each se mester of CUW attendance. The grade will depend upon the number of absences. CUW 100 meets Monday at 10:00 a.m. in Turner Auditorium and is required of all freshmen during their first two semesters at Campbell University. All first year freshmen at Campbell University are required to take CUW 100 for the first two semesters of college.

Complete a minimum of 12 upper-level semester hours in the departmental major at Campbell. A student may be a candidate for only one undergraduate degree. Normally, each student chooses a major field when nearing completi on of the core curriculum requirements, usually not later than the second semester of the sophomore year. Each Campbell University student is responsible for ensuring that the choice of major is properly and currently recorded with his/her adviser and in the Registrar's Office and the University Computer. Please Note: Students must take cognizance of th e fact that the Registrar's Office is the office of record with respect to student acade mic information during residence and at the time of graduation. If the information on record in that office is not correct, then permanent student records as well as Federal, State, Fina ncial Aid, and VA reports can be in error, perhaps causing the student academic and/or financial hardship. Double Majors It is someti mes possible to com plete the requi rements for two majors while in residence. Qualification in two majors does not entitle a candidate to two degrees. Depending upon the requirements, this process may necessitate an additional semester or two in residence. Forms for declaring multiple majors are availa ble in the Registrar's Office. Students who desire qualification in two major fields must obtain for the official record the one-time written approval of both of the appropriate depa rtment chairpersons and have the approvals on file in the Registrar's Office. Since requi rements for the major vary by department, the student must select one department's requirements as primary. In the event of misunderstandings or conflicts with respect to requirements with one of the majors, the problem must be resolved by the department chairperson of the department where the problem resides. In the case of duplicate requirements, the student may be released from the course requirement by the department chair of the secondary major, but the student must still have 128 hours for graduation. Students must have a 3.0 average before starting a double-major program. Please Note: Students receiving veteran's benefits must document with the Veteran's Affairs Coordinator, the Office of the Registrar, and the appropriate de partment chairs their intent to pursue the double major or a major with a minor. A written course requirement sheet, agreed to by respective department chairs, must be provided to the veteran's benefit student with the clear understanding that an additional semester may be required to complete all requirements. The course requirement sheet will be developed on a case-by- case basis, tailored individually, and agreed to by the appropriate department chairs. Successful completion of all degree requirements will result in award of a single diploma. Minors Students may also elect to earn a minor field. Requirem ents for minors are normally less demanding than those of a major field. Minimum requirements for a minor are 18 semester hours, including at least five courses. Variati ons will be determined by the appropriate department. The student must designate the major and minor fields in writing to the Campbell University 2007-2009 16 registrar at the time of application for graduation. There is no grade point average requirement to meet before commencing work on a minor; however, no credit will be given for a minor unless the student has a \"C\" averag e (2.000) when all courses counting toward the requirement are included. VI. For the bachelor's degree, earn 128 semester hours of credit, of which the last 32 must be at Campbell. N.B I: A student is normally allowed to attempt only 160 semester hours before graduation. This number may be exceeded only with the approval of the Retention Committee. From time to time, changes are made in General College Curriculum requirements, graduation requirements, and related matters. Unless otherwise indicated, such changes will be applicable to all students enrolled at the time the change is adopted, as well as to all students who re-enroll after a period of absence. N.B. II: Extended Campus students will be gov erned by the academic residency requirements of the Service-Members Opportunity Colleges (SOC), which at the baccalaureate level requires 32 minimum credit hours, of which 12 must be in upper-level coursework in the major with Campbell.

Standards and Expectations Ethics and Discipline, Code of Ethics Christian higher education has always been a major concern and integral part of Baptist life in North Carolina. Consequently, over the years, Christian universities and the church have stood as partners. Campbell University plays an important role in the mission of the church and the mission of the Kingdom of God on earth. Campbell University is Christian but not sectarian. Each year, many religious denominations and faiths are represented on the campus. However, it is expected that all those who attend the University will be sympathetic to its stated purposes. As a Christian university, Campbell is co mmitted to teaching students to think with Christian values as their basic guidelines. Accord ingly, it is incumbent upon the University to provide its students with a code of honorable behavior that in its observance makes more nearly possible an environment whereby the student can grow spiritually, morally, and intellectually. To perpetuate these Christian ideals and principles, it is the responsibility of each student to maintain a high standard of personal be havior. Thus, a student who matriculates at Campbell University 2007-2009 33 Campbell University should demonstrate a willingness to abide by the following code while a member of the student body. The code of Campbell University arises dire ctly out of the institution's statement of purpose. The basic principles which guide the development of Christian character and govern Christian behavior are to be found in the Scri ptures. Moral law is the gift of God and is fully revealed in the teachings of Jesus Christ. The student, by virtue of his enrollment, agrees to abide by the rules and moral precepts which govern the University community. Because of the University's commitment to the Lordship of Christ over every area of life, w holehearted obedience to moral law as set forth in the Old and New Testaments and exemplifie d in the life of Christ applies to every member of the University community, regardless of position. While the Bible does not provide a specific teaching regarding all social practices, its emphasis on general principles is unmista kable, particularly in circumstances where lack of self-restraint would be harmful or offensive to others. Out of these general principles come certai n concrete expectati ons which should be viewed not negatively but as practical guidelines for conduct and for a productive way of life: To uphold at all times and in all places, both on- and off-campus, the University's statement of purpose. To protect the property rights of others from theft, damage, or misuse. To adhere to all college policies and re gulations, including the rules governing the use of facilities, housing on and off th e campus, and campus organizations. To obey, respect, and uphold the law of the land. To refrain from the possession, use, or distribution of alcoholic beverages and drugs. To maintain a standard of dress wh ich insures neatness, cleanliness, and appropriateness of attire. To exhibit good taste, decency, and restraint at all times, refraining from disorderly conduct and indecent, profane, or obscene expression. To be honest in all behavior, never chea ting, plagiarizing, or knowingly giving false information. To abstain from any sexual relations outside the bonds of marriage. To exemplify principles of honor, integrity, and morality, and to help others fulfill their obligations under this code. Student Handbook The Student Handbook is published each year by the student personnel staff. Student activities, campus services, academic regulati ons and policies, and regulations governing student life at Campbell University are stated in the Student Handbook. Every student is expected to become thoroughly acquainted with the Student Handbook. Students are responsible for complying with the policies and regulations presented in the annual edition of the Student Handbook.

Grades of \"IC, WP, AU, and P\" will not affect the grade point average. The cumulative grade point average (GPA) is determined by dividing the total quality points earned by the total number of semester hours attempted. A grade of \"I\" (Incomplete) must be removed by the completion of the work within 30 days after the opening of the next semester; ot herwise, it will be recorded as an \"F\". A grade of \"IC\" must be removed by the completion of the work within 120 days; otherwise, it will be recorded as an \"F\". A student may appeal a grade within a period of one academic year from the semester in which the grade was assigned. No changes to the transcript will be made after a twelve-month period unless a professor acknowledges in writing that an error in grade reporting has occurred. The Grade of \"FX\" A faculty me mber has a number of courses of action available to deal with academic dishonesty. In less flagrant situations involving students with no previous record of academic dishonesty, the faculty member may refer the case to the Office of Student Life Campbell University 2007-2009 35 or the faculty member may choose to assign a gr ade of \"FX.\" The \"F\" indicates failure of the course; the \"X\" indicates the reason for th at failure (i.e., academic dishonesty). The \"X\" will remain on the student's record until he or she graduates or transfers to another college or university. The \"F\" may be replaced if the student retakes the course. If the student believes that the \"FX\" grade is not justified, he or she may appeal the \"X\" portion of the grade to the Student Conduct Committee unless the violation is plagiarism in which the appeal is to the Faculty Conduct Committee. The Committee will hear the appeal and may affirm the \"X\" or direct the registrar to remove it from the student's record.

Campbell University Financial Aid Office Satisfactory Ac ademic Pro gress Policy (SAP) (Revised January 2005) The Higher Education Act mandates institutions of higher education to establish minimum standards of \"Satisfactory Academic Progress.\" Campbell University makes these standards applicable to all programs funded by the federal government, including but not limited to Federal Pell Grants, Federal S upplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, Federal Perkins Loans, Federal Work-Study, Fe deral Stafford Loans, and Federal Parent PLUS Loans. These standards are also applicab le to certain North Carolina aid programs, Campbell University 2007-2009 50 including but not limited to, the North Carolina Student Incentive Grant, North Carolina State Contractual Scholarship Fund, North Caro lina Loan Program for Health, Science, and Mathematics; and certain university controlle d scholarships based in part upon academic ability. Programs administered by agencies other th an Campbell University, such as private scholarships, or grants given by states ot her than North Carolina, may have their own academic standards for students. Students will n eed to contact such agencies to find out what those requirements are. Campbell University Academic and Endowed scholarships have academic requirements that are higher than those in this policy. Student-Athletes must satisfy the eligibilit y requirements established by Campbell University and by the NCAA to be eligible for athletically related financial aid. General Satisfactory Academic Progress Principles These principles apply to all of Ca mpbell University's degree programs. Specific guidelines for each academic program are ou tlined after these general principles. 1. Federal Regulations require the university to establish SAP standards in the following areas: (1) Cumulative GPA; (2) Cumulative Hours Earned; and (3) Maximum Time Frame. In addition, a school's SAP policy must include the student's total academic history. 2. These general principles apply to all of Campbell University's degree programs. In addition to the general principles, st udents must meet specific guidelines for their individual academic program(s). Program specific requirements are detailed after the general principles. 3. Any student who is enrolled in more than one academic program must meet the guidelines for each of the programs in which they are enrolled . 4. SAP will be determined one time per academic year , specifically, at the end of each Spring semester. Students wishing to have their progress reevaluated at other times during the year must submit a written request to the financial aid office. 5. To earn hours at Campbell University, a stude nt must receive a grade of A, B, C, or D. Any other grade does not earn hours. 6. Classes in which a student receives a grade of Withdrew Passing (WP) will not be counted as hours attempted nor hours earned, therefore, will not negatively impact a student's ability to satisfy SAP. 7. Classes in which a student receives a grade of Withdrew Failing (WF) will be counted as hours attempted but not hours earned, therefore, will negatively impact a student's ability to satisfy SAP. 8. Classes in which a student receives a grade of Incomplete (I or IC) count as hours attempted but not as hours earned, therefore, will negatively impact a student's ability to satisfy SAP. 9. When a student repeats a course, the total attempted hours will increase with each repeat, but the student will only earn hours for a completed course once. Therefore, repeating classes will negatively impact a student's ability to satisfy the 70% passage rate, but may significantly increase a student's cumulative GPA. 10. Included in attempted hours are all c oursework attempted, including transfer credits, which consists of passed, repeated, incomplete, failed, and withdrew failing courses. Attempted hours do not include credits earned through Advanced Campbell University 2007-2009 51 Placement (AP), College Level Examina tion Program (CLEP), or other similar testing programs. Failure to Meet Satisfactory Academic Progress Students who fail to m eet the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards will be placed on Financial Aid Probation (FAP) for a period up to one academic year. During the FAP period, a student will be eligible to receive fi nancial aid. No student will be allowed more than two (2) semesters of FAP for the duration of any particular degree program at Campbell. At the end of the FAP period, students who still do not meet the SAP standards will be placed on Financial Aid Cancellation (FAC). Students who are placed on FAC will be ineligible for financial aid. Transfer students will be evaluated at the time of enrollment using the same SAP standards. Students returning to Campbell University following a period of absence or FAC must meet Campbell's SAP policy in order to regain eligibility for financial aid. Appeals Students on Financial Aid Probation or Can cellation may make a written appeal to the Financial Aid Committee. The Financial Aid Co mmittee is comprised of the Director and Assistant Directors of Financial Aid. If necessary, the Dean of Admissions, Financial Aid, and Veteran's Affairs may be included. Financ ial aid may be reinstated by the committee upon demonstration of mitigating circumstances, which must be documented in writing to the satisfaction of the committee. Examples of mitigating circumstances and appropriate documentation include, but are not necessarily limited to: 1. Serious Illness of student--statement from physician that illness interfered with student's ability to meet SAP along with written letter of appeal from student. 2. Serious Illness of immediate family me mber--statement from a physician along with written letter of appeal from student. 3. Death of an immediate/close family me mber--statement from a minister, nearest relative, or an unbiased concerned adult along with written lette r of appeal from student. 4. Disruptive internal family problems--state ment from parents, minister, or an unbiased concerned adult along with writte n letter of appeal from student. Satisfactory Academic Progress for Undergraduate Students Cum ulative GPA The cumulative number of credits attempted in the undergraduate schools of the university includes those credits attempted as of the last day to drop a course. Multiple attempts of the same course will be counted for each attempt for financial aid purposes. Campbell University 2007-2009 52 Credits Attempted Minimum Cumulative GPA 1 - 47 1.4 48 - 77 1.6 78 - 109 1.8 110 - 129 1.9 130 - 192 2.0 In addition, any student with a quality point de ficit of 40 or more as calculated by the Registrar will be deemed academically in eligible, and therefore, will be placed directly on Financial Aid Cancellation without a probation period.

Campbell University 2007-2009 56 Standards for North Carolina Residents With the passage of the 2001 budget, the No rth Carolina Legislature began requiring institutions t o reduce a student's eligibilit y for the North Carolina Legislative Tuition Grant (NCLTG) if s/he has attempted 140 hours or more. The reduction is equal to 25% of the student's regular eligibility. This applies only to students who would otherwise be eligible for the NCLTG. This standard includes all attempted coursework including repeated, incomplete, failed, withdrew faili ng, and withdrew passing courses. Attempted hours for the NCLTG program only do not include credits earned through Advanced Placement (AP), College Level Examinati on Program (CLEP), other similar testing programs, or credits taken during summer school. In addition, NC regulations prohibit awarding state funds to students who are pursuing an acade m ic major whose intent is to train the student in a religious vocation. The number of religious vocation majors at Campbell Univers ity is very limited, and only a small number of students will fall into this category. Students pursuing Religion as a major are eligible for NC funds. Refund/Repayment Policy In the event of a student's complete wit hdrawal from the university for a particular enrollment period, refunds/repayments are ca lculated according to the Higher Education Act and its subsequent modifica tions. Campbell University will comply fully with federal regulations as required. This method will be used to determine refunds/repayments for Title IV aid as well as state and institutional ai d. This includes students who do not follow the university's policy for official withdrawal. Students may acquire a copy of the Campbe ll University Refunds/Repayment Policy upon request from either the Business Office or the Financial Aid Office. Scholarships Each year, Campbell University provides assist ance to many of its students through various scholarships that are financed through ins titutional funds as well as privately funded sources.

The government continues to pay the interest during the six-month grace period. A Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan is a non-need-based loan. Unlike the Subsidized Stafford Loan, interest on the Unsubsidized St afford, which begins to accrue at the time of disbursement, is the responsibility of the student. Students have the option to (1) make payments on the interest while enrolled; or (2) have their lender capitalize interest while enrolled. Note: Origination and insurance fees of up to 4 % may be deducted from loan proceeds by the lender.

Campbell University 2007-2009 65 Departments/Schools and Course Descriptions College of Arts and Sciences Dean: Dr. Mark L. Hammond The undergra duate College is the custodian of the liberal arts core curriculum. This General College Curriculum (GCC) is the integr ated, interdisciplinary education, which is the hallmark of the liberal arts. It is of medieval European origin; traditionally at the completion of the two-year post-secondary period, European colleges awarded the baccalaureate, which signified the recipient's entry into educated society; students then went to university for the study of the law, medicine, or theology. The tradition was imported to America, where the concept of \"major\" or specialized study was added as the traditional curriculum evolved away from its European roots. In colonial America, all elementary, middle, and secondary educati on was conducted under the auspices of the Christian church. In the nineteenth centu ry, population growth and the process of secularization of society stimulated the initiati on and rapid expansion of public education to insure the continuation of a literate cu lture, the fundamental basis of democratic government. At the beginning of the twentieth century, only twenty percent of college students were in land-grant colleges and public un iversities; the rest were in private, often church-related colleges and schools. By the e nd of the twentieth century, the proportions were reversed, with only twenty percent of college students in private and/or church- related schools. The College of Arts and Sciences of Campbell University is one of those remaining church-related schools. The central thread in the history of the Univer sity is the development of the College and its curriculum. Founded in 1887 as an academ y, the institution has experienced no interruption in the work of its faculty. Until 1925, it was Buie's Creek Academy; from then until 1963, it was a well-respected junior college. Beginning with the class of 1963, Campbell College became a four-year senior institution; then, with the graduation of the first class from the Norman Adrian Wiggi ns School of Law, Campbell became a university. Thus, the College of Arts and Sciences evolved as the successor undergraduate College within the larger body of the Univers ity. Its graduates span the globe, serving in a wide variety of fields and callings. The purpose of the University is derived from that of the College; succinctly stated, it is to educat e and encourage its students of all ages to think, live, and serve others in a forthright , Christian way. The success of this College as an exemplar of excellence in education in a Christian community in a secularized society is a credit to the vision of its founder, Rev. J. A. Campbell, and to the achievements of his successor presidents, Leslie Campbell, Norman A. Wiggins, and Jerry M. Wallace. Majors, Minors, and Pre-Professional Programs Each Cam p bell University student is required to declare a major by the beginning of the junior year, but has the option not to select a minor field of study. Pre-professional programs include pre-law, pre-pharmacy, pre-medical/dental, and pre-seminary, as well as a pre-engineering program approved by North Carolina State University. Class sizes vary from eighty in science lectures to twenty-four in science labs to thirty-five in humanities lectures to twenty-five in freshman Englis h to less than fifteen in senior humanities seminars. Campbell University 2007-2009 66 Faculty of the College Along with its students, the College's greatest asset is its faculty. Some of the senior members have served the school for four decades; they impart not only academic knowledge, but also wisdom to their students a nd institutional memory to their colleagues. Over eighty percent of the faculty have the highest available degree in their teaching discipline; that percentage is growing as th e former junior college faculty retire. The Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law Dean: Melissa Essary In July of 1975, following extended feasibility studies, the General Board of the North Carolina Baptist State Convention approved establishment of the Campbell University School of Law. In August of 1976, the charter class of 97 students was admitted. The University Trustees named the law school in 1987 in honor of the founding president. The decision to establish the School of Law was not lightly taken; it was made with the firm conviction that the Campbell University School of Law and its graduates would help meet needs presently unmet, particularly in the southeastern United States. This School of Law was not designed to be one that duplicates the emphasis and programs of existing law schools. Rather, its intention w as to formulate a unique program to educate a particular type of lawyer for whom there is a special and continuing need. Campbell educates lawyers who are prepared from the outset of their careers to serve their communities with legal skill and ethical and intellectual leadership, in the noblest tradition of the counselor. The School of Law is a highly demanding, purposely small, intensely personal community of faculty and students whose aim, guided by transcendent values, is to develop lawyers who possess moral conviction, social compassion, and professional competence and who view the practice of law as a calling to serve others and to create a more just society. The Lundy-Fetterman School of Business Dean: Dr. Ben Hawkins In October 1982, the es tablishment of the Lundy-Fetterman School of Business was announced. The School was named for the late Bu rrows T. and Mabel L. Lundy, generous benefactors to the University and strong supporters of Free Enterprise, as well as for Lewis and Annabelle Fetterman , son-in-law and daughter of th e late Mr. and Mrs. Lundy. The Lundy-Fetterman School of Business is a community of scholars and professionals who are committed to developing students as responsible individuals through an emphasis on professional education, entrepreneurial attitudes, Christian values, and practical experiences. The mission of the School of Business, at both the undergraduate and Campbell University 2007-2009 67 graduate levels, is to engage students in a learning process that provides a comprehensive professional education, instills a passion for life-long learning, creates a commitment to service, and examines ethical behavior in th e business environment. Graduates of the Lundy-Fetterman School of Business are prep ared for careers in a rapidly changing business environment. They are aware of the significance of technology in business organizations, the value of a global perspective in planning, the need for an understanding of cultural diversity, and the process of continuous improvement in shaping business operations. The Lundy-Fetterman School of Business strives to be recognized as a premier business school known for its free enterprise based cu rriculum, distinctive academic programs, practical work experiences, and values-based entrepreneurial emphasis. The actions and activities of the faculty and sta ff are based on a core of values held in the School of Business. Seven specific belief st atements form the foundation for these core values. 1. The creation of a caring family-type environment is essential to the personalized style of education provided to students. 2. An entrepreneurial free enterprise focus is important to all aspects of the academic programs. 3. Programs of study on all campuses will provide for academic excellence. 4. Practical work experiences are an important part of a holistic educational process in the School of Business. 5. An understanding of Christian values provides a solid foundation for a life-long commitment to service in business or professional environments. 6. A strong liberal arts academic foundati on is a critical component of a true professional education. 7. Faculty and staff should model a passi on for learning, an understanding of the global environment, and the values of integrity, mutual respect, and accountability in personal and professional relationships. Academic and Professional Programs The Lundy -Fetter man School of Business offers programs that serve undergraduate and graduate students, as well as executives. Intern ships are required in the Professional Golf Management and Trust and Wealth Management programs. The evening graduate programs, Master of Business Administration and Master of Trust and Wealth Management, serve working professionals. U ndergraduate and graduate programs are designed to provide flexibility which can acco mmodate working adults in their role as students. The School of Business also designs and delivers executive education programs in partnership with industry primarily in the trust area. The orientation of the faculty is teaching and service, supported and augmented by focused applied research. The Lundy-Fetterman School of Business is hou sed in a 76,000 square foot state-of-the-art building. This two-story building features a 5,500-pound solid piece cupola (the tallest point on campus), ten tiered and conventional classrooms, an auditorium, student and faculty lounges, a library, an academic computer center, museum and exhibit hall, board room, faculty and administrative staff offi ces, conference rooms, interview facilities, student work/breakout rooms, and reception areas.

Campbell University 2007-2009 163 Honors Program Directors: Dr. Ortiz, TBD The Honors Program Statement of Purpose The Honors Program at Campbell University exis ts to enrich the educational experience of students whose academic successes and demonstrat ed character indicate that they are likely to benefit from the additional challenges of an enhanced course of study. The Honors Program builds on the standard curriculum in two related ways. First, it fosters the intellectual growth of honors students by expecting that they demonstrate both broad knowledge and deep understanding. Honors students demonstrate breadth of knowledge in a general way by maintaining a high level of su ccess in all of their classes. In addition, they participate in academically challengi ng classes designed especially for the Honors Program which emphasize, by means of inte rdisciplinary presentation, the integral relatedness of all knowledge. Students finish these classes more fully aware that the abstractions of philosophy may have very prac tical historical consequences, for example, or that literary works may influence developm ents in the natural sciences. Because they develop particular topics in greater detail th an similar courses in the standard curriculum do, these classes also require that honors students gain depth of understanding. To put it another way, they ask students to grapple with the complexity that characterizes much of human experience. Because wholeness of life involves more than intellect, however, the Honors Program fosters a second area of growth in students, gr owth towards the maturity of character that serves others. This area of growth involves, first, an awareness that human beings, in addition to being intellectual beings, are also social and cultural. The Honors Program enriches the social experience of students by encouraging honors students to recognize themselves as members of a community through making it possible for them to meet socially. In addition to such informal soci al events as picnics and study sessions, these social occasions include more formal cultu ral opportunities, such as together attending a Shakespeare play. These events are meant to be enjoyed, of course, but also to make students more aware that they are participan ts in a society, a culture, and a community involving others. Integrity of living further requires gratitude and service. The Honors Program expects honors students to recognize and act on an aw areness that their natural gifts and their practiced skills have not been developed in isolation, but in community. When students are able to see that they are part of a commun ity, they are more likely to take seriously the claims of that community on their lives. Family, friends, faith communities, and teachers have all contributed in their various ways to the successes of most students. Honors students recognize, in other words, that their intellectual and personal gifts come with responsibilities; they work to fulfill these r esponsibilities by serving as leaders among their peers and by giving personal time to others (in missions or tutoring or other community service). Through their participation in ser vice activities, honors students practice their commitment to the good of others and express gratitude for the good they have received. These service activities round out the learning experience of honors students; through working for others, being exposed to new s ituations, and interacting with people they might not otherwise meet, students will learn about themselves and their world in ways that build on and balance classroom learning. Campbell University 2007-2009 164 While the honors program exists primarily as a means of enhancing the learning and service opportunities of motivated and gifted students, it also benefits the broader University community. Because the program ac tively invites faculty to design creative and challenging courses for the honors student, it en courages every faculty member to think about his or her teaching subject in fresh ways . Professors who teach in the program profit from the chance to develop and t each their ideas to a select group of motivated learners. In addition, the interdisciplinary emphasis of the program promotes faculty dialogue as professors look beyond their own specialties and beyond their own departments for support in developing the honors courses. These benefits for faculty will ultimately enrich the learning of the student body at large; ideally, professors who have taught in the hon ors program will bring to their other classes the fresh insights they have developed as we ll as new perspectives that may be suggested to them by the honors students. The honors students also, as they interact with other students, are likely to challenge and encourage them, both academically and with respect to service opportunities, making their own contribut ion to the general student population. Ideally, honors students will continue to inte ract positively with the communities they are part of away from campus and after graduati on\u2014in their churches, home towns, graduate programs, and professional lives\u2014making them, in these communities, ambassadors for Campbell University. The Honors Program Requirements For Adm ission into the Program: As an incoming freshman: o High school GPA=4.0 or higher o SAT=1100 or higher As a second-semester freshman or transfer student: o College GPA=3.25 or higher o Letter of recommendation from faculty For Continuance in the Program: Maintain a college GPA=3.25 or higher Successful completion of courses in the Honors Curriculum Participation in community service: o At least one group service activity pe r semester (or an equivalent acceptable to the committee) o Individual service hours on the following per-semester schedule: o 2 group activities (8-12 hours) + 12 hours individual service=20-24 hours/semester OR 1 group activity (4-6 hours) + 20 hours individual service=24-30 hours/semester Participation in social events (one of two scheduled each semester) The Honors Program Curriculum Over the course of several y ears, the Honors Curriculum Committee has worked to establish a curriculum which would accomplish the goals of the program and fulfill the needs and interests of both students and facu lty. The results of this work, as outlined below, define a program that is innovative, integrative, and challenging.
