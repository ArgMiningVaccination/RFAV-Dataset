We recommend that patients follow their doctor's guidance in regard to nootropic supplements. Brillia is a homeopathic nootropic supplement. The brand claims that it \"enhances clarity & improves focus,\" and it's marketed both to children and adults. But what is homeopathic medicine and is there any evidence it works? Does Brillia contain research-backed ingredients for improving focus and mental clarity? Does it contain any potentially harmful ingredients? And how do real users rate and describe the effects of Brilia? In this article we'll answer all of these questions and more as we review medical research on homeopathy to give our take on whether the practice generally is effective or is unscientific. We'll then analyze the ingredients in Brillia based on clinical trials to give our take on whether the supplement is likely to be effective. We'll share our concerns about the research cited by the brand to prove their product works, and highlight real, unsponsored customer reviews. Is Homeopathy Unscientific? Homeopathy is an unsubstantiated medical discipline that uses extremely small amounts of active substances and claims that these small amounts are actually more potent than larger amounts of the substance, which defies basic logic. A [meta-study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20402610/) published in the Medical Journal of Australia analyzed data from tens of clinical trials on homeopathy. The study authors concluded that homeopathy has not been proven effective for any health condition: \"The findings of currently available Cochrane reviews of studies of homeopathy do not show that homeopathic medicines have effects beyond placebo.\" As we discussed in our [AZO Yeast Plus reviews](https://illuminatelabs.org/blogs/health/azo-yeast-plus-review) article on another homeopathic supplement, we have not come across any convincing medical research suggesting that homeopathy works. A YouTube video on the \"Reactions\" channel has over 450,000 views, is produced by the American Chemical Society, and investigates in an engaging and animated way what the tenets of homeopathy are and whether or not they are proven to work: Highly Questionable Brillia Research Brillia claims there is \"verified science\" and \"in-depth research\" backing their product on a page on their site titled \"Verified Science.\" The page features graphics such as the one shown above which suggest that the supplement has been studied in a clinical trial. However, there is zero explanation where this data came from and there are no links on the page to a full clinical trial. We consider it to be a major red flag when a supplement company claims their product is clinically proven to work without clearly citing a clinical trial backing that claim. It leaves consumers without the full set of information to make an informed purchase decision. The same page claims that Brillia \"has the efficacy of other prescription medications without the harmful side-effects,\" as shown above. This is an unproven, uncited and dangerous claim. There is no proof that Brillia is as effective as other nootropic supplements or drugs, and we cannot determine whether Brillia has been studied in any clinical trials published in peer-reviewed medical or scientific research journals proving it to be free of side effects. The prescription drug comparison is highly confusing, because Brillia is not a prescription medication. It's available for purchase online with a notice on another page stating \"No prescription required,\" as shown below. We hope that the FDA and FTC will investigate these disease claims and claims of clinical efficacy made by Brillia. Nothing published by the brand convinces us of the efficacy of their product, and we recommend that consumers be wary of health brands making claims of clinical efficacy without support for those claims. Brilla Ingredient Analysis Brillia contains three active ingredients, all of which are different potencies of a compound called Lapine S-100 immune globulin. We cannot find any clinical studies published in peer-reviewed medical journals proving the safety or efficacy of this ingredient. Brillia describes this ingredient as \"antibodies to the brain-specific S100 protein.\" We consider antibody therapy a very strange way to target something as simple as focus and attention, when there are research-backed and safe alternatives like caffeine which have been studied extensively for those outcomes. As shown in the ingredient label above, the active ingredients are listed with a numeric multiplier of \"C:\" 12C, 30C and 200C. The \"C\" describes how many times the active ingredient is diluted in a homeopathic remedy. Wikipedia's [resource page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathic_dilutions) on homeopathic dilutions documents that a 30C dilution results in such a small amount of the original ingredient that no molecules of the original ingredient would exist if diluted in water. There are no active ingredients in this formulation that we consider likely to be effective for improving focus or concentration. Real, Unsponsored Brillia User Reviews A TikTok user named Erin shares her experience using Brillia to treat her children who have ADHD: [@erin.the.great...nurse]pardon my hair and face but I wanted to get this out to share. [#momsoftiktok] [#RN] [#proudmama] [#Brillia] [#registerednurse] [#momlife] [#adhd] [ original sound - Erin] A YouTube creator named Dana Kay explains whether or not she recommends Brillia: Does Brilla Cause Side Effects? Brillia's Drug Facts label claims that \"allergic reactions may occur in very rare cases,\" likely due to the inclusion of lactose as an inactive ingredient. Lactose intolerant individuals may wish to avoid this supplement. Brillia's own \"Verified Science\" page reports the following side effects for trial participants taking the supplement: headaches (2% of users), impaired glucose tolerance (2%), hay fever (2%). The same page concludes: \"Therefore, Brillia is determined to be completely safe\" which seems strange considering the above information. We do not believe that Brillia will cause side effects for the average consumer for the same reason that we do not believe any homeopathic medication will: the active ingredients are included at too low of a dose to have any biological effects or side effects. Can Behavioral Therapy Treat ADHD in Children? A video published by NBC News is only two minutes long and explores results from a medical study which found that behavioral therapy was highly effective for ADHD in children. We consider this to be relevant and worth considering given that Brillia is marketed to children: Our Nootropic Supplement Picks There are herbs which have been shown in medical studies to be effective for short-term cognitive enhancement and memory support. Ginkgo biloba extract is arguably the most well-studied nootropic supplement apart from caffeine, and was shown in a [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10890330/) to enhance neurocognitive functions in older adults. A [medical review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11026748/) published in the Psychopharmacology journal found ginkgo biloba supplementation to also improve attention and cognitive performance in healthy, young adults. Illuminate Labs manufactures a [Ginkgo Biloba Extract Supplement](https://illuminatelabs.org/products/ginkgo-biloba-extract) that's potent and 6% terpene lactones) and third-party tested to ensure purity and label accuracy.

Panax ginseng extract is another well-studied nootropic supplement.
