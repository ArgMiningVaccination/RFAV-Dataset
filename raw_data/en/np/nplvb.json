ADMINISTRATION PART 15. TEXAS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES COMMISSION CHAPTER 354. MEDICAID HEALTH SERVICES SUBCHAPTER A. PURCHASED HEALTH SERVICES DIVISION 25. SCHOOL HEALTH AND RELATED SERVICES 1 TAC \u00a7354.1341, \u00a7354.1342 The Executive Commissioner of the Texas Health and Hu- man Services Commission (HHSC) adopts amendments to \u00a7354.1341, concerning Benefits and Limitations; and \u00a7354.1342, concerning Conditions for Participation. The amendments to \u00a7354.1341 and \u00a7354.1342 are adopted without changes to the proposed text as published in the August 5, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4607). These rules will not be republished. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION The School Health and Related Services (SHARS) program is jointly administered by HHSC and the Texas Education Agency (TEA). The SHARS program allows independent school districts and public charter schools to obtain Medicaid reimbursement for the provision of certain direct medical and transportation services to Medicaid enrolled students who receive benefits to meet federal and state laws guaranteeing the students a free and appropriate public education. Currently, SHARS must be prescribed in a student's individualized education program (IEP) as required by the Texas Education Code, \u00a729.001(7), and implemented through Commissioner of Education rule at Title 19 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) \u00a789.1001. The adopted amendment to \u00a7354.1341 is necessary to comply with implementation of House Bill (H.B.) 706, 86th Legislature, Regular Session, 2019. H.B. 706 amended the Texas Educa- tion Code by adding \u00a738.033 to permit SHARS providers to bill and receive reimbursement for allowable audiology services pro- vided to Medicaid-eligible children as prescribed in a plan cre- ated under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7794). H.B. 706 requires HHSC to adopt rules neces- sary to implement Texas Education Code Section 38.033 (re- designated as Section 38.034 by H.B. 3607, 87th Legislature, Regular Session, 2021) in consultation with the Texas Educa- tion Agency and as approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The adopted amendment to \u00a7354.1342 implements H.B. 2658, 87th Legislature, Regular Session, 2021, effective 1, 2021. H.B. 2658 added Human Resources Code \u00a732.0317. The adopted amendment restated and clarified the federal require- ment to obtain parental consent to access a student's Medicaid in order to receive Medicaid reimbursement for all SHARS ser- vices. The adopted amendments to \u00a7354.1341 and \u00a7354.1342 also align these rules with 1 TAC \u00a7355.8443, concerning Reimburse- ment Methodology for School Health and Related Services (SHARS), and include other clarifying language. COMMENTS The 31-day comment period ended September 6, 2022. During this period, HHSC received comments regarding the pro- posed rules from six commenters, including the Texas Associa- tion of School Boards (TASB), the Texas Association of School Business Officers (TASBO), Ounce of Prevention, Houston In- dependent School District (ISD), Royse City ISD, and one indi- vidual. HHSC considered all comments received, both in writ- ing and at a public hearing on August 22, 2022, regarding the proposed amendments. A summary of comments relating to \u00a7354.1341 and \u00a7354.1342 and HHSC's responses follows. Comment: A commenter asked a clarifying question as to whether proposed amendments to \u00a7354.1341 and \u00a7354.1342 relating to the expansion of SHARS audiology services for stu- dents with a Section 504 Plan would require a student to have a 504 Plan in order for the schools to obtain reimbursement for SHARS. Response: The proposed amendment permits Local Education Agencies (LEAs) to seek Medicaid reimbursement for providing applicable SHARS audiology evaluation and management ser- vices to eligible students with either a Section 504 Plan or an IEP. However, for all other SHARS services, an eligible student must have an IEP in order for LEAs to seek Medicaid reimbursement for the services. Comment: A commenter expressed disagreement with the SHARS programmatic changes associated with the proposed amendments to \u00a7354.1341 and \u00a7354.1342 relating to the expansion of SHARS audiology services for students with a Section 504 Plan. The commenter asserted these proposed amendments along with proposed amendment to \u00a7355.8443 would result in more administrative work for special education teachers and administrators. The commenter requested HHSC reconsider the associated proposed rule amendments and work with school districts to find better alternatives. Response: HHSC respectfully declines to reconsider the pro- posed amendments to \u00a7354.1341 and \u00a7354.1342 in response to this comment. As required by H.B. 706, HHSC consulted ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7657 with TEA on the development of the proposed amendments re- lated to SHARS audiology evaluation and management services for students with a Section 504 Plan and considers these pro- posed amendments as an opportunity for LEAs to obtain addi- tional Medicaid reimbursement. Although LEAs are not required to participate in the SHARS program and LEAs that do partic- ipate are not required to seek reimbursement for Section 504 audiology services, all participating LEAs must comply with the requirements of the program. The amendment to \u00a7355.8443 be- came effective October 9, 2022, and HHSC addressed applica- ble public comments regarding the amendment accordingly. Comment: A commenter expressed disagreement with the SHARS programmatic changes associated with the proposed amendment to \u00a7354.1342 relating to the addition of required annual SHARS trainings. The commenter asserted the pro- posed amendment along with the amendment to \u00a7355.8443 would result in more administrative work for special education teachers and administrators. The commenter requested HHSC halt the associated proposed rule amendments and study the changes more fully. Response: HHSC respectfully declines to halt proposed amend- ment to \u00a7354.1342 in response to this comment. LEAs will be required to complete SHARS programmatic, cost report, and time study trainings on an annual basis to be certain all appli- cable staff are properly informed of the requirements for partic- ipating in and seeking reimbursement for services provided un- der the SHARS program. LEAs are not required to participate in the SHARS program; however, if they choose to participate, they must comply with all requirements of the program. The amendment to \u00a7355.8443 became effective October 9, 2022, and HHSC addressed applicable public comments regarding the amendment accordingly. Comment: Multiple commenters expressed disagreement with the proposed rule amendment to \u00a7354.1342, requiring compli- ance with parental consent and notification requirements in 34 CFR \u00a7300.154 before accessing a student's Medicaid to pay for SHARS prescribed in the student's Section 504 Plan or IEP. The commenters asserted the inclusion of the parental consent methodology change associated with the cost reports and new parental consent rules requiring the date of consent will reduce federal reimbursements to schools for special education ser- vices. The commenters requested HHSC either halt or revise the associated proposed rule amendments and study the changes more fully. Response: HHSC respectfully declines to revise or halt the pro- posed amendment to \u00a7354.1342 in response to this comment. The parental consent requirements are not new. As stipulated in 34 CFR \u00a7300.154, LEAs have always been required to ob- tain parental consent prior to accessing a student's Medicaid benefits to pay for SHARS. Any related changes to cost report methodology are outside the scope for the proposed amendment to \u00a7354.1342. Comment: Multiple commenters expressed disagreement with the proposed amendment to \u00a7354.1342, requiring compliance with \u00a7355.8443. The commenters asserted that the proposed amendment to related rule \u00a7355.8443, published in the April 29, 2022, issue of the Texas Register have not been implemented; thus, creating confusion as stakeholders do not have final rule to comply with. Additionally, the commenters expressed concern relating to the proposed amendment to \u00a7355.8443 indicating dis- agreement with proposed changes to the SHARS cost reporting methodology, interim claiming, IEP ratio, time study participant list, and associated parental consent requirements. The com- menters requested HHSC either halt or revise the associated proposed rule amendments and study the changes more fully. Response: HHSC respectfully declines to halt or revise the pro- posed amendment to \u00a7354.1342 in response to this comment. HHSC acknowledges the proposed amendment to \u00a7355.8443 was published in the April 29, 2022, issue of the Texas Regis- ter, which was before the proposed amendments to \u00a7354.1341 and \u00a7354.1342 were published. However, LEAs currently are required to comply with \u00a7355.8443, and the proposed amend- ment to \u00a7354.1342 clarifies this requirement. The amendment to \u00a7355.8443 became effective October 9, 2022, and HHSC ad- dressed applicable public comments regarding the amendment accordingly. Comment: Multiple commenters expressed concern with the SHARS programmatic changes associated with proposed amendments to \u00a7\u00a7354.1341, 354.1342, and 355.8443, as well as updates to the SHARS Medicaid medical policy relating to re- cently amended documentation requirements. The commenters asserted these changes taken together will negatively impact the school Medicaid program and cause participation to become more difficult, which is not in alignment with recent information released from CMS on the subject of \"School-Based Services in Medicaid: Funding, Documentation and Expanding Services.\" The commenters requested HHSC either halt or revise the associated proposed amendments and study the changes more fully. Responses: HHSC respectfully declines to halt or revise pro- posed amendments to \u00a7354.1341 and \u00a7354.1342 in response to this comment. HHSC believes the proposed amendments allow- ing LEAs to seek reimbursement for providing applicable SHARS audiology evaluation and management services to eligible stu- dents with a Section 504 Plan are aligned with the referenced information bulletin released by CMS. LEAs are not required to participate in the SHARS program; however, if they choose to participate, they must comply with all requirements of the pro- gram, including documentation requirements. The amendment to \u00a7355.8443 became effective October 9, 2022, and HHSC ad- dressed applicable public comments regarding the amendment accordingly. Comment: A commenter expressed the need for increased transparency and stakeholder participation, asserting that deci- sions are being made without necessary input from educators and administrators who work in special education. Response: HHSC acknowledges this comment but respectfully disagrees with the commenter that decisions are being made without stakeholder input. HHSC sought stakeholder input and comment from educators, administrators, providers, and the general public at various intervals during the SHARS rulemaking process. HHSC engaged TEA during the rule development phase prior to publishing the proposed amendments in the Texas Register on August 5, 2022. HHSC accepted public input throughout the public comment period, and during the public hearing on August 22, 2022, at which interested parties had the opportunity to provide verbal and written comments regarding the proposed amendments. STATUTORY AUTHORITY The amendments are adopted by Texas Government Code \u00a7531.0055, which provides that the Executive Commissioner of HHSC shall adopt rules for the operation and provision of services by the health and human services agencies; Texas 47 TexReg 7658 November 18, 2022 Texas Register Government Code \u00a7531.033, which authorizes the Executive Commissioner of HHSC to adopt rules as necessary to carry out the commission's duties; and Texas Human Resources Code \u00a732.021 and Texas Government Code \u00a7531.021(a), which authorize HHSC to administer the federal medical assistance (Medicaid) program. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the adop- tion and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal au- thority.

ECONOMIC REGULATION PART 1. RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS CHAPTER 3. OIL AND GAS DIVISION 16 TAC \u00a73.65 The Railroad Commission of Texas (the \"Commission\") adopts amendments to \u00a73.65, relating to Critical Designation of Natural Gas Infrastructure, with changes to the proposed text as pub- lished in the September 16, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 5560). The amendments are adopted to simplify the rule language and the process for designating certain natural gas facilities and entities critical during energy emergencies. Section 3.65 went into effect December 20, 2021. It imple- mented requirements from House Bill 3648 and Senate Bill 3 (87th Legislature, Regular Session) directing the Commission to collaborate with the Public Utility Commission of Texas (the \"PUC\") to adopt rules to establish a process to designate certain natural gas facilities and entities associated with providing natural gas in this state as critical customers or critical gas sup- pliers during energy emergencies. The Commission's process for designating certain facilities critical has been in place for approximately ten months. During that time, the Commission became aware of points of confusion in current \u00a73.65. Addition- ally, during the recent comment period for proposed 16 Texas Administrative Code \u00a73.66 (relating to Weather Emergency Preparedness Standards), the Commission received several comments requesting changes to \u00a73.65. The Commission addresses some of those concerns with these adopted amend- ments. The Commission received 35 comments on the proposal: 7 from associations, 18 from companies/organizations, and 10 from in- dividuals. Comments on proposed amendments to \u00a73.65(a) - Definitions CrownQuest Operating (CrownQuest), Office of Public Utility Counsel (OPUC), Permian Regulatory Solutions (PRS), and the Texas Oil and Gas Association (TXOGA) support the Com- mission's proposed amendments to the definition of \"energy emergency.\" The Commission appreciates these comments. TXOGA and the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) requested that the Commission notify operators with facilities subject to the requirements of \u00a73.65 when the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) issues an Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) 1, EEA 2, or EEA 3. The Commission will notify operators of a weather emergency as defined in \u00a73.66. Thus, the Commission will notify operators when weather conditions result in an energy emergency, as that term is modified in these amendments. The Texas Competitive Power Advocates (TCPA) and Texas Electric Cooperatives (TEC) suggested the Commission align the definition of \"energy emergency\" with the definition of \"weather emergency\" adopted by the PUC. TCPA and TEC expressed concern that the Commission's definition of \"energy emergency,\" which focuses on ERCOT-issued EEAs, places the threshold for targeted action at a point in an emergency where there could be insufficient time to implement meaningful steps to stave off further situational deterioration. TCPA and TEC noted that gas facilities should address the risk of losing production long before the onset of an EEA. Thus, TCPA suggested the Commission define \"energy emergency\" more broadly to include an Operating Condition Notice, Advisory, Watch, or some other threshold prior to an EEA and TEC suggested the Commission define \"energy emergency\" to include an Emergency Notice. The Commission declines to change the definition in response to these comments. The requirement in the Commission's weath- erization rule, \u00a73.66, is for facilities subject to that rule to \"imple- ment measures to prepare to operate during a weather emer- gency.\" Weather emergency is defined in \u00a73.66 as \"weather con- ditions such as freezing temperatures, freezing precipitation, or extreme heat in the facility's county or counties that result in an energy emergency as defined by \u00a73.65 of this title.\" Because an energy emergency is now defined as when the reliability co- ordinator issues an Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) 1, 2, or 3, facilities subject to \u00a73.66 are required to implement measures to prepare to operate in weather conditions that result in the is- suance of an EEA 1, 2, or 3. The Commission finds that if a facil- ity has implemented measures to prepare to operate in weather conditions that cause an EEA 1 or higher, then consequently, the facility is prepared to operate in less serious conditions, such as those that prompt a advisory, watch, or emergency notice. Thus, the facility will be prepared to operate in the period leading up to the emergency - the period about which TCPA and TEC ex- pressed concern. Henry Resources, LLC (Henry) asked that the Commission in- clude clarifying definitions of \"electricity supply chain map\" and \"Director.\" The Commission agrees that adding definitions to clarify these terms is helpful and adopts subsection (a) with changes to add the definitions in paragraphs (4) and (5). ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7661 Comments on proposed amendments to \u00a73.65(b) - Critical Des- ignation Criteria Bluefin Resources, Citation Oil and Gas Corp. (Citation), Creek Energy, Inc., CrownQuest, Henry, OPUC, Diamondback, PRS, Southwest Gas Systems, Stephens Engineering, Permian Basin Petroleum Association (PBPA), the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers (Alliance), TXOGA, TIPRO, and four individuals ex- pressed support for the Commission's proposed amendments in subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B), which increase the average amount of gas a gas well or oil lease must produce for it to be designated critical. The Commission appreciates the support of these commenters. Diamondback requested the Commission raise the threshold to 1500 Mcf/day for oil leases. The Atmos Cities Steering Com- mittee (ACSC) and TEC also asked that the Commission further limit the list of critical facilities. Conversely, Commission Shift expressed concern that too many facilities are excluded and the remaining facilities designated critical will not produce enough gas to meet peak demand experienced during Winter Storm Uri. These four comments highlight the difficulty in striking the ap- propriate balance in determining the amount of critical facilities - designating too many facilities critical places a burden on elec- tric utilities when prioritizing critical loads during an energy emer- gency and designating too few facilities critical risks losing natu- ral gas supply to meet demand during the emergency. As the Commission noted in the preamble for the proposed amend- ments, raising the threshold in \u00a73.65(b)(1) to 250 Mcf/day for gas wells and 500 Mcf/day for oil leases producing casinghead gas leaves 78.4% of the total natural gas produced per day, or approximately 24.5 Bcf/day of natural gas, designated as critical while removing the low-producing gas wells and oil leases, which aggregated together statewide only represent a small portion of the natural gas production. However, they account for a large number of the facilities. Thus, removing these facilities from the list reduces the burden on electric utilities and helps ensure other electric customers receive power in an emergency. Additionally, gas-fired generation nameplate capacity in Texas is 15 Bcf/day according to TCPA. During Winter Storm Uri, peak day demand for gas-fired generation was approximately 9 Bcf/day based on American Gas Association's estimates. The Commission also notes that raising the volume thresholds in subsection (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) does not preclude facilities producing under the thresholds from producing gas during an energy emergency. Removing those wells and leases from the critical gas supplier list merely prevents their power from being prioritized by electric utilities during a load-shed event. How- ever, the facilities may be located on the same meter as another critical facility such that their power remains on and they con- tinue to produce, or they may otherwise maintain power, allowing more than 24.5 Bcf of production to be available. Therefore, the Commission declines to make changes to subsection (b)(1)(A) or subsection (b)(1)(B) in response to these comments. ACSC also commented that the Commission has not provided enough guidance to electric utilities regarding how the facilities should be prioritized. The Commission should establish a hier- archy to provide direction during load shed events. The Commission declines to make any changes in response to this comment. The PUC has the authority to regulate electric utilities and has published guidance on how critical natural gas facilities should be prioritized for load-shed purposes. The guid- ance is available on the PUC's website. Regarding the list of facilities in subsection (b)(1), the Alliance and TXOGA requested that the facilities only be designated crit- ical if they are also included on the electricity supply chain map developed by the Electricity Supply Chain Security and Mapping Committee pursuant to Senate Bill 3 (87th Legislature, Regular Session). The Commission disagrees. The facilities on the electricity sup- ply chain map are included on the map because they are located in the natural gas supply chain for electric generation. Thus, they are designated critical to ensure electric utilities prioritize their power during an energy emergency and they continue to oper- ate to provide gas for electric generation. However, facilities that are not included on the map provide natural gas to other end users, notably, local distribution companies (LDCs) that serve city gates. Therefore, these facilities should also remain critical. Relatedly, TEC asked that the Commission further limit the list of critical facilities to only those that directly support the delivery of gas to gas-fired electric generation or to end users. The Commission notes that facilities that help provide gas to gas-fired electric generation and other end users are those des- ignated critical in \u00a73.65(b)(1). Other facilities designated critical in subsection (b)(1), such as saltwater disposal facilities, are in- cluded because if they lose power and are unable to operate, facilities that more directly contribute to the supply chain may be unable to operate. The Commission also notes that it adopts changes to the list of critical facilities in subsection (b) due to other comments. AVAD Operating LLC, Slant Operating, PBPA, the Alliance, and one individual asked the Commission to find a solution for large waterflood/enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects. These oper- ations cover large areas of land (often thousands of acres) and are particularly vulnerable to cold weather but produce negligible volumes of casinghead gas from each unit, especially consider- ing the likelihood of high energy intensive electricity equipment required to operate a single lease. The Commission understands this concern and adopts subsec- tions (a) and (b) with changes to address EOR projects. Sub- section (a) is adopted with a change to define \"EOR project\" for the purposes of \u00a73.65 as \"an enhanced oil recovery project as defined in \u00a73.50(c)(6) of this title (relating to Enhanced Oil Re- covery Projects-Approval and Certification for Tax Incentive) with at least one injection well permitted under \u00a73.46 of this title (re- lating to Fluid Injection into Productive Reservoirs) whether or not the project has received Commission approval or certifica- tion under \u00a73.50.\" Changes adopted in subsection (b)(1)(B) ex- clude EOR projects from oil leases designated critical provided the EOR project consumes more energy than it produces calcu- lated by comparing the amount of electricity used to the amount of gas produced both in Million British Thermal Units (MMBTU). Henry, TXOGA, the Alliance, WaterBridge Operating LLC, and Stephens Engineering commented about the Commission's crit- ical designation of saltwater disposal facilities and saltwater dis- posal pipelines in \u00a73.65(b)(1)(H). Henry and TXOGA requested that the Commission limit the saltwater disposal facilities desig- nated as critical to those that support the other facilities desig- nated critical in subsection (b)(1). The Alliance and WaterBridge raised concerns that the designation of all saltwater disposal fa- cilities in subsection (b)(1)(H) does not allow flexibility for saltwa- ter disposal well networks connected through pipelines. These networks allow operators to shift disposal volumes to different areas if constraints arise in one part of their system. The Al- 47 TexReg 7662 November 18, 2022 Texas Register liance and WaterBridge requested the rule allow operators of in- terconnected systems to only designate as critical the portions of the network necessary to ensure sufficient disposal capacity is maintained. Stephens asked for clarification on which types of saltwater disposal facilities are included in subsection (b)(1)(H) and asked that critical designation be limited to commercial salt- water disposal facilities. The Commission declines to make changes in response to these comments. The Commission prefers that operators of saltwater disposal facilities who do not want their facilities to be critical seek an exception to critical designation through the process in subsection (e). If a saltwater disposal facility is not on the elec- tricity supply chain map and can provide objective evidence that it does not support a critical facility listed in subsection (b)(1)(A)- (G), then it is eligible for an exception to critical designation, as discussed in the section regarding comments on subsection (e) below. Similarly, the Commission disagrees with the Alliance and Wa- terBridge that saltwater disposal connected system operators should be able to determine which facilities on their system are critical. The Commission notes that all saltwater disposal facili- ties that are not included on the electricity supply chain map are now eligible to request an exception to critical designation. The Commission prefers saltwater disposal facilities to go through the exception process rather than removing these facilities from the list of critical facilities. The Commission disagrees with Stephens that critical saltwater disposal facilities should be limited to commercial facilities. The Commission defines commercial saltwater disposal facilities as those whose owner or operator receives compensation from oth- ers for the storage, reclamation, treatment, or disposal of oil field fluids or oil and gas wastes that are wholly or partially trucked or hauled to the facility and whose primary business purpose is to provide these services for compensation. This definition ex- cludes saltwater disposal facilities that receive waste through a pipeline and the Commission determines facilities that receive waste through a pipeline should be designated critical. TCPA asked the Commission to provide clarity as to whether gas infrastructure facilities used to export natural gas from Texas via intrastate gas pipelines to Mexico or by way of liquefied natural gas (LNG) liquefaction and export terminals into the international LNG market are or should be designated as critical infrastruc- ture. LNG facilities are not currently designated critical under \u00a73.65(b)(1) and the Commission declines to make changes to subsection (b) to include LNG facilities or LNG export terminals. Senate Bill 3 specified that the Commission's critical designation rule should designate certain facilities that are associated with providing natural gas in this state. LNG being exported for the international market is outside the intended scope of Senate Bill 3. Additionally, the Commission has no jurisdiction over LNG export facilities. A natural gas pipeline subject to the juris- diction of the Commission that delivers natural gas to an LNG liquefaction plant may be designated critical under subsection (b)(1)(D) (\"natural gas pipelines and pipeline facilities including associated compressor stations and control centers\"); however, if the pipeline is not on the electricity supply chain map and all of the natural gas delivered by the pipeline facility is consumed outside of this state, the pipeline is eligible to apply for an exception to critical designation pursuant to \u00a73.65(e). TXOGA requested additional clarity regarding natural gas liquids transportation and storage facilities, which are designated critical in \u00a73.65(b)(1)(G). TXOGA suggested that natural gas liquids that originate at crude oil wells be exempted from critical designation. The Commission disagrees. Section 3.65(b)(1) designates as critical natural gas liquids transportation and storage facilities to ensure facilities that store or carry off natural gas liquids retain power. If these facilities lose power and a gas processing facility or an oil lease operator has no transport or storage for natural gas liquids, then the liquids may back up and slow or stop pro- duction or processing of natural gas. Henry requested that the Commission clarify the term \"critical customer,\" in subsection (b)(2) by changing the description to \"a critical customer is a critical gas supplier that requires electricity to operate.\" The Commission agrees to clarify the term \"critical customer,\" but does not adopt Henry's proposed language, which would in- advertently include facilities that have their own power source or otherwise do not receive power from an electric entity. The Commission adopts \u00a73.65(b)(2) with the following description: \"A critical customer is a critical gas supplier that requires elec- tricity delivered by an electric entity to operate.\" This change en- sures that only customers of electric entities are deemed \"critical customers\" such that only true customers are required to be pri- oritized by the electric entities for load shed purposes. Comments on proposed amendments to \u00a73.65(c) - Request for Critical Designation Citation and PRS commented in support of the Commission's proposed amendments to subsection (c). The Commission ap- preciates the support of these commenters. TCPA and TEC commented that facilities that qualify for an ex- ception under the list of reasonable bases and justifications in \u00a73.65(e)(2)(A)-(C) should not be eligible to request critical des- ignation under \u00a73.65(c). The Commission agrees in part. A facility that does not con- tribute to the natural gas supply chain in Texas should not be des- ignated critical unless the facility supports a facility designated critical in subsection (b)(1). To be designated critical through the process in \u00a73.65(c), a facility's operator must show with objec- tive evidence that the facility's operation is required for another facility designated critical in \u00a73.65(b) to operate. The Commis- sion retains this process in the adopted amendments to ensure facilities not listed in subsection (b)(1) may apply to retain power if their operation is required for a critical facility to operate. ACSC requested clarification regarding the process for request- ing critical designation under \u00a73.65(c). Specifically, ACSC re- quested clarification regarding who makes the determination that a facility is critical and how that decision is made. The Commission agrees to clarify the process for requesting crit- ical designation and adopts subsection (c) to state that the Crit- ical Infrastructure Division director reviews applications submit- ted under \u00a73.65(c). The changes also clarify that if a request for critical designation is denied, the applicant may request a hear- ing. The Commission notes that the determination will be made based on the whether the requirements specified in subsection (c) are satisfied. Subsection (c) requires an applicant to submit objective evidence that the facility requesting critical designation must operate in order for a facility designated critical in subsec- tion (b) to operate. ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7663 Comments on proposed amendments to \u00a73.65(e) - Critical Des- ignation Exception Henry, Occidental (Oxy), PBPA, PRS, the Alliance, TXOGA, and TIPRO commented that every critical facility should be able to request an exception regardless of the facility's status on the electricity supply chain map. The Commission declines to make any changes in response to these comments. It is the Commission's understanding that the legislature does not support allowing facilities on the electricity supply chain map to apply for an exception to critical designation. When \u00a73.65 was proposed in 2021, the Senate Business and Commerce Committee submitted a comment letter on the pro- posed rule. The letter stated, \"Under no circumstances should a component of the natural gas supply chain that is directly tied to electric power generation be allowed to opt out of the critical designation requirements and subsequent weatherization.\" TIPRO also requested that critical facilities that are not included on the electricity supply chain map be allowed to request an ex- ception. The amendments as proposed allow critical facilities not included on the electricity supply chain map to request an exception if the operator's reasonable basis and justification for the exception aligns with the examples provided in \u00a73.65(e)(2). The Alliance suggested that disposal wells that are disposing relatively small volumes in their daily operations be allowed to apply for a critical designation exception, just as disposal wells not supporting critical wells are currently allowed to do. The amendments as proposed allow saltwater disposal facilities and pipelines not included on the electricity supply chain map to request an exception. A reasonable basis and justification for saltwater disposal facilities is added in \u00a73.65(e)(2)(D) in re- sponse to comments below. Regarding the examples of a reasonable basis and justification that may be provided with an exception request, TCPA noted that there may be more than just natural gas production that is directed entirely out of state and the reasonable basis and jus- tification in \u00a73.65(e)(2)(B) should be amended to include other types of facilities. PRS and an individual requested the Commission add more bases for exception into the rule to allow for more administrative exceptions and reduce the number of hearings. Henry and PBPA requested that the Commission include a reasonable basis and justification specific to saltwater disposal facilities in \u00a73.65(e)(2). The Commission adopts \u00a73.65(e)(2) with changes in response to these comments. The Commission adds \"processed\" and \"delivered\" in subsection (e)(2)(B) to address processing facil- ities and pipeline facilities. The Commission also adopts new \u00a73.65(e)(2)(D) to provide a reasonable basis and justification ap- plicable to saltwater disposal facilities. A saltwater disposal facil- ity or saltwater disposal pipeline may request an exception if it is not included on the electricity supply chain map and it provides objective evidence to show that the facility or pipeline does not support a facility designated critical in \u00a73.65(b)(1)(A)-(G). Stephens Engineering commented that it is impossible to provide objective evidence of where lease water comes from for a non- commercial saltwater disposal facility. Thus, Stephens suggests a statement from the operator should be sufficient evidence to support an exception application. The Commission understands this concern but declines to re- move the requirement for objective evidence. To grant admin- istrative approval without a hearing, Commission Staff must be able to verify the reasonable basis and justification claimed by a facility seeking an exception to critical designation. Citation asked that the Commission include in the list of rea- sonable bases and justifications the bases and justifications approved in a final order by the Commission after a hearing. Henry also requested that a reasonable basis and justification approved in a final order of the Commission be added in sub- section (e)(2). The Commission does not agree these should be added to the rule because the list would become incomplete if the Commis- sion issues additional final orders after a hearing. TXOGA commented that the examples of reasonable bases and justifications does not adequately address possible exceptions for natural gas liquids pipelines. The Commission notes that the list of reasonable bases and jus- tifications is not exhaustive. Under the proposed amendments, natural gas liquids facilities and pipelines are eligible to request an exception if the facility/pipeline is not included on the elec- tricity supply chain map. The Commission makes no changes in response to this comment. In addition to Henry's comments requesting provisions in \u00a73.65(e)(2) for saltwater disposal facilities and a reasonable ba- sis and justification approved after a hearing, Henry requested that the following reasonable bases and justifications be added to subsection (e)(2): (1) The facility does not produce gas that supports electric generation in the state; (2) Gas production reported on an oil lease basis is disproportionately high when compared to gas production attributable to the individual oil wells on the lease; (3) The Commission has not provided at least 30 days written notice to the operator prior to the March 1 or September 1 Form CID filing deadline that the facility is included on the map; and (4) Other good cause shown, including but not limited to, facilities are capable of reducing their demand in response to an instruction issued by the applicable power region's reliability coordinator during certain grid conditions. The Commission declines to add these provisions to \u00a73.65(e)(2). First, the Commission notes that the list of reasonable bases and justifications contains examples and is not an exhaustive list. Operators seeking an exception may provide objective evidence of a reasonable basis and justification not contained in the list and receive administrative review. If the exception request is administratively denied, the operator may request a hearing. Regarding Henry's first suggestion, the Commission disagrees that a facility that does not produce gas for electric generation should be able to obtain an exception on that basis alone. Fa- cilities that do not support electric generation help provide gas for other end users, such as local distribution companies (LDCs) that serve city gates. Regarding Henry's second item, the Com- mission partly addressed this concern with changes to subsec- tion (b)(1)(B) regarding EOR projects. The Commission also de- clines to add Henry's third item. The Commission understands operators' concerns with receiving notice of their facilities on the electricity supply chain map because a facility's map status af- fects whether it is required to weatherize pursuant to \u00a73.66. Al- though \u00a73.65 and \u00a73.66 are related, the purpose of \u00a73.65 is not solely to identify facilities required to weatherize, but to designate facilities as critical customers so that critical customers' power is prioritized during a load-shed event. Thus, an operator's failure 47 TexReg 7664 November 18, 2022 Texas Register to receive notice from the Commission regarding a facility's map status is not a sufficient reason to be exempt from critical des- ignation. Finally, the Commission declines to add Henry's fourth item. Section 3.65 already allows an operator to submit an ex- ception application for other good cause shown, because the list included in subsection (e)(2) merely contains examples. Further, it is not appropriate for the Commission to make changes that impact demand response programs managed by reliability co- ordinators and outside the Commission's authority to regulate. Operators concerned with demand response program implica- tions may contact their reliability coordinator regarding changes to these programs. The Commission received several comments regarding amend- ments proposed in \u00a73.65(e)(2)(D), which allow an operator to submit objective evidence of an electric utility's denial of a facility's critical designation application as a reasonable basis and justification in support of an exception application. The Commission notes that this provision proposed in subsection (e)(2)(D) is adopted as subsection (e)(2)(E) because of the new language related to saltwater disposal facilities adopted as subsection (e)(2)(D). TCPA's comment stated that for the majority of Texas, the \"elec- tric entity\" that will receive and review critical designation forms required under 16 TAC \u00a725.52(h) (relating to Reliability and Con- tinuity of Service) will be Transmission and Distribution Utilities (TDUs). TDUs deliver electricity, but in the ERCOT competitive market, the provision of electricity is a transaction between gen- erators and retail electric providers for the benefit of providing service to the customer. Thus, TCPA suggested the word \"pro- viding\" in proposed subsection (e)(2)(D) be changed to \"deliver- ing.\" The Commission appreciates this insight from TCPA and adopts \u00a73.65(e)(2)(E) with the requested change. Commission Shift commented that a denial from an electric utility should not be a reason an operator is eligible for an exception under subsection (e)(2) because designating facilities critical is not the sole purpose of \u00a73.65. PBPA expressed support for the proposed amendment allowing an exception if a facility's critical load request is denied by their utility. The Commission understands that a facility that receives an ex- ception from critical designation is no longer required to weather- ize under the requirements of \u00a73.66. The Commission considers an exception to critical designation and, consequently, weather- ization requirements, appropriate when a facility's electric utility has communicated the facility's power will not be prioritized dur- ing a weather emergency. It would be unreasonable to require an operator to invest in weatherizing a facility that is a critical customer (i.e., a facility requiring electricity from an electric util- ity to operate) if the electric utility communicates the customer's electricity will not be prioritized. ACSC requested a change to subsection (e)(2)(D) to specify electric utilities' authority to deny a request for critical status. The Commission does not regulate electric utilities and, there- fore, declines to make changes addressing electric utilities' au- thority for denials. However, the Commission notes that Utilities Code \u00a738.074 directs electric utilities to be provided discretion to prioritize power delivery and power restoration among facilities and entities designated critical, as circumstances require. Commission Shift commented generally on subsection (e)(2) ex- pressing concern that the list contains examples of reasonable bases and justifications such that the Commission could rou- tinely grant exceptions for other reasons not listed in the rule. Commission Shift is correct that the Commission retains discre- tion to approve exceptions for additional reasons. However, the Commission included the examples because the Commission considers those reasons sufficient. A request for an exception that does not align with the examples in subsection (e)(2) would require a hearing before it could be approved. Henry requested the Commission revise \u00a73.65(e) to require the CID director to administratively approve a request for exception if the exception was previously approved for the same facility or facilities. The Commission declines to add the requested language. An exception will be administratively approved if it meets the re- quirements of \u00a73.65 at the time the exception request is filed. Other Comments Proposed amendments in subsection (e) reference the electricity supply chain map, and the Commission received several com- ments about the map. Atmos Pipeline Texas (APT), PBPA, TX- OGA, and an individual asked that the Commission clarify the process operators should use for adding or removing assets from the map. These comments are outside the scope of this rulemaking, but the Commission will consider these comments as it works to en- sure the map continues to be viable and accurate. An individual, WaterBridge, and Commission Shift expressed concerns about the confidentiality of the electricity supply chain map. The Commission does not have authority to address these con- cerns. The information on the electricity supply chain map is deemed confidential by Texas Utilities Code \u00a738.203. ACSC and the Joint TDUs (AEP Texas Inc., Entergy Texas, Inc., Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC, Southwestern Electric Power Company, Southwestern Public Service Company, and Texas-New Mexico Power Company) noted that \u00a73.66 requires a facility to weatherize only if it is designated critical under \u00a73.65 and on the electricity supply chain map. Thus, some facilities may be critical but not on the map and, therefore, are not re- quired to weatherize. The comments stated it does not make sense for utilities to have to prioritize facilities as critical if they are not required to weatherize. The Joint TDUs stated the Com- mission should require all critical facilities to weatherize, not just those that are included on the map. The Commission declines to make any changes in response to these comments. The Commission's authority in Natural Re- sources Code \u00a786.044 to adopt rules requiring gas supply chain facilities to implement measures to prepare to operate during a weather emergency (i.e., \"weatherize) is limited to gas sup- ply chain facilities that are (1) included on the electricity supply chain map; and (2) designated critical by the Commission. The legislature included the two elements intentionally. If the legisla- ture intended for all facilities designated critical to weatherize, it would not have included the first element, which limits the list of facilities required to weatherize to those on the electricity supply chain map. Requiring facilities that are not on the map to weath- erize goes beyond what was authorized in \u00a786.044. Commission Shift requested that the Commission clearly explain how both gas production and storage can meet demand needs during the next weather event. The Commission should also ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7665 disclose its plan for extra supply in the event the supply chain is not functioning in all geographies. The CID should develop systems and processes to regularly compare projected gas de- mand against the supply that can be generated from facilities designated as critical and subject to the weatherization rule. The Commission will not \"establish a plan for extra supply\" be- cause the Commission does not have authority to require facil- ities to operate during a weather emergency. Further, it is not appropriate to explain production and storage availability, de- mand needs, or CID systems and processes in \u00a73.65; therefore, the Commission declines to make any changes to the rule in re- sponse to these comments. Finally, the Commission received several comments that ad- dress issues outside the scope of the proposed amendments. Two individuals, PBPA, PRS, and Southwest Gas Systems commented about experiencing difficulty with the critical desig- nation and exception request filing processes (the Form CI-D and CI-X filings, respectively). The Commission is working to improve the filing process and re- solve any technical issues that arise. The Commission has also increased its CID staff since the first filing deadline in January 2022, and more staff members are available to assist operators when filing deadlines occur. Commission Shift expressed concern regarding when operators transfer their critical assets between the Form CI-D filing dead- lines and asked how the new operator's contact information will be available if a weather emergency occurs during that time- frame. The Commission understands this concern. For most critical fa- cilities, the Commission requires a filing upon transfer of a facility to a new operator. The Commission can access this information during an emergency if necessary. The Commission is working to ensure it has accurate information for the remainder of the fa- cilities. The Commission also notes that it coordinated with the PUC when \u00a73.65 was adopted in 2021. The PUC and the electric utilities informed the Commission that the electric utilities create their critical load lists twice per year and cannot continually up- date the critical load information. Thus, to align with this process and lessen the administrative burden on the utilities, \u00a73.65 re- quires critical customers to send their electric utility their critical customer information twice per year. Commission Shift commented that the penalties for violations of \u00a73.65 are too low to incentivize compliance. The Commission disagrees and declines to make any changes because the penalty rule, \u00a73.107 of this title (relating to Penalty Guidelines for Oil and Gas Violations), was not included in this rulemaking. Commission Shift expressed concern that ERCOT is still using a redundant form and process to obtain information from opera- tors on whether they represent a critical load. Commission Shift asked the Commission to coordinate with ERCOT to simplify the process for operators and reduce redundancies. The Commission will communicate this concern to ERCOT but notes that it cannot require ERCOT to change its process. TEC asked the Commission to provide another tool to electric utilities by allowing electric utilities to obtain assistance from the Commission in parsing critical load applications submitted to the utility. The Commission is available to assist electric utilities with critical load applications. The Commission does not make any changes to the rule in response to this comment. NGL Water Solutions requested an opportunity to engage with the Commission to discuss weatherization methods for saltwater disposal wells and systems. This comment is outside the scope of \u00a73.65 but the Commission notes it will engage with operators when it updates the Weath- erization Practices Guidance Document on its website. Finally, the Commission received a comment from an individual about hydrogen sulfide gas, which is not related to \u00a73.65, and a comment from another individual regarding Commission train- ings on \u00a73.65. The Commission makes no changes in response to these comments. The adopted rule language is summarized in the paragraphs be- low. Amendments to subsection (a) provide more certainty regarding the definition of \"energy emergency.\" The Commission adopts amendments to define an event with \"potential to result in firm load shed\" as when the reliability coordinator of a power re- gion in Texas issues an Energy Emergency Alert Level 1 or 2. More clearly defining when there is a potential for firm load shed will provide operators with more certainty as to when an energy emergency is occurring. Section 3.66, which was adopted concurrently when these amendments to \u00a73.65 were proposed, contains a related defini- tion. It defines weather emergency as \"weather conditions such as freezing temperatures, freezing precipitation, or extreme heat in the facility's county or counties that result in an energy emergency as defined by \u00a73.65 of this title.\" Comments received on \u00a73.66 noted the lack of certainty in the definition due to its reference to \"energy emergency\" in \u00a73.65. The adopted amendments to subsection (a) address these concerns. As noted above, subsection (a) is also adopted with definitions of \"Director,\" \"electricity supply chain map,\" and \"EOR project\" in response to comments. The Commission adopts amendments to the list of critical gas suppliers in subsection (b)(1). The Commission received multi- ple comments on the original proposal of \u00a73.65 expressing con- cern that the list of critical gas suppliers encompassed too many facilities such that electric utilities may experience a burden in prioritizing the facilities for load-shed purposes. Similarly, com- ments on \u00a73.66 requested reducing facilities on the list by ex- cluding more gas wells and oil leases with marginal production. The amendments now adopted in \u00a73.65(b)(1) exclude gas wells producing an average of 250 Mcf of natural gas per day or less and oil leases producing an average of 500 Mcf of natural gas per day or less. The Commission also adopts subsection (b)(1)(B) with changes due to comments on EOR projects. Third, adopted amendments in subsections (c), (e), and (f) re- vise requirements triggered by a critical gas supplier's inclusion on the electricity supply chain map produced by the Texas Elec- tricity Supply Chain Security and Mapping Committee. Changes to subsection (c) allow a facility that is not designated a criti- cal gas supplier in subsection (b) an exemption from filing Form CI-D. Additional amendments are adopted in subsection (c) in response to comments requesting clarification on the process to request critical designation. 47 TexReg 7666 November 18, 2022 Texas Register Amendments to subsection (e) and (f) clarify that if a facility des- ignated critical in subsection (b) is included on the electricity sup- ply chain map, it is not eligible to request an exception from crit- ical designation. Adopted changes to subsection (e) and (f) restate the exception process to affirmatively state which facilities are eligible for an exception rather than stating the facilities that are not eligible for an exception. The amendments remove the current language in subsection (e) and make current subsection (f) new subsection (e). Adopted subsection (e) states that a facility designated critical under subsection (b) may request an exception unless the facil- ity is included on the electricity supply chain map. The amend- ments also clarify the acceptable reasons for requesting an ex- ception. The reasons are examples which are intended to cap- ture the Commission's goal that facilities contributing natural gas to the supply chain in Texas are not eligible for an exception. Subsection (e)(2)(A) and (e)(2)(C) were included in the original proposal of \u00a73.65 when it was adopted effective December 20, 2021. In this rulemaking, the exceptions are moved from sub- section (e)(1) to the list in subsection (e)(2). Adopted subsec- tion (e)(2)(B) adds language consistent with Natural Resources Code \u00a781.073, which states, \"The commission shall collaborate with the Public Utility Commission of Texas to adopt rules to es- tablish a process to designate certain natural gas facilities and entities associated with providing natural gas in this state as crit- ical customers or critical gas suppliers during energy emergen- cies\" (emphasis added). The Commission adopts subsection (e)(2) with changes to in- clude new subsection (e)(2)(D), which provides a reasonable basis and justification specific to saltwater disposal facilities in response to comments. Regarding adopted subsection (e)(2)(E), proposed as subsec- tion (e)(2)(D), it is the Commission's understanding that some fa- cilities designated critical customers were denied as critical loads by their electric utilities. This decision is in the electric utility's dis- cretion. However, if a critical facility is denied as a critical load, the amendments allow the facility to request an exception such that it is not required to comply with \u00a73.65. The exception will not be approved if the utility's denial was not communicated in writing or was due to errors made by the critical facility in submit- ting its critical customer information. Similarly, the exception will not be approved if the denial was based on the utility's adminis- trative reasons, such as the facility's power is already prioritized due to its location on a meter that is already a critical load. Other adopted amendments merely update internal references due to the removal of subsection (e) and the renaming of sub- section (f). The Commission adopts the amendments under Texas Natural Resources Code \u00a781.073, which requires the Commission to adopt rules to establish a process to designate natural gas fa- cilities and entities associated with providing natural gas in this state as critical customers or critical gas suppliers during an en- ergy emergency; and Texas Natural Resources Code, \u00a781.051 and \u00a781.052, which give the Commission jurisdiction over all per- sons owning or engaged in drilling or operating oil or gas wells in Texas and the authority to adopt all necessary rules for governing and regulating persons and their operations under the jurisdic- tion of the Commission. Statutory authority: Natural Resources Code \u00a7\u00a781.051, 81.052, and 81.073. Cross reference to statute: Natural Resources Code Chapter 81. \u00a73.65. Critical Designation of Natural Gas Infrastructure. (a) Definitions. (1) In this section, the term \"energy emergency\" means any event that results in firm load shed or has the potential to result in firm load shed required by the reliability coordinator of a power region in Texas. An event that has the \"potential to result in firm load shed\" is when the reliability coordinator of a power region in Texas has issued an Energy Emergency Alert Level 1 or 2. (2) In this section, the term \"critical customer information\" means the information required on Commission Form CI-D and any attachments. (3) In this section, \"any volume of gas indicated in Mcf/day\" means the average daily production from the well's six most recently filed monthly production reports. Wells without six months of production reports shall average the production from the well's production reports on file with the Commission or use the production volume from the well's initial potential test or deliverability test if the well has not yet filed a production report. (4) In this section, the term \"electricity supply chain map\" means the electricity supply chain map produced by the Texas Electric- ity Supply Chain Security and Mapping Committee. (5) In this section, the term \"Director\" means the Director of the Critical Infrastructure Division or the director's delegate. (6) In this section, the term \"EOR project\" means an enhanced oil recovery project as defined in \u00a73.50(c)(6) of this title (relating to Enhanced Oil Recovery Projects-Approval and Certifi- cation for Tax Incentive) with at least one injection well permitted under \u00a73.46 of this title (relating to Fluid Injection into Productive Reservoirs) whether or not the project has received Commission approval or certification under \u00a73.50 of this title. (b) Critical designation criteria. The following facilities are designated critical during an energy emergency: (1) Critical Gas Supplier. The following facilities are des- ignated a critical gas supplier: (A) gas wells producing gas in excess of 250 Mcf/day; (B) oil leases producing casinghead gas in excess of 500 Mcf/day, except for EOR projects provided the EOR project consumes more energy than it produces calculated by comparing the amount of electricity used to the amount of gas produced both in Million British Thermal Units (MMBTU); (C) gas processing plants; (D) natural gas pipelines and pipeline facilities includ- ing associated compressor stations and control centers; (E) local distribution company pipelines and pipeline facilities including associated compressor stations and control centers; (F) underground natural gas storage facilities; (G) natural gas liquids transportation and storage facil- ities; and (H) saltwater disposal facilities including saltwater dis- posal pipelines. (2) Critical Customer. A critical customer is a critical gas supplier that requires electricity delivered by an electric entity to oper- ate. A critical customer is required to provide critical customer infor- mation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section to the electric entities ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7667 described in \u00a725.52(h) of this title (relating to Reliability and Conti- nuity of Service) and Texas Utilities Code \u00a738.074(b)(1) so that those electric entities may prioritize the facilities in accordance with Texas Utilities Code \u00a738.074(b)(2) and (b)(3). Priority for load shed purposes during an energy emergency is described by \u00a725.52(h)(2) of this title and any guidance issued thereunder by the Public Utility Commission. (c) Request for critical designation if not designated critical in subsection (b) of this section. A facility that is not designated critical under subsection (b) of this section may write to the Commission to apply to be designated critical if the facility's operation is required in order for another facility designated critical to operate. The applicant shall include objective evidence that the facility's operation is required for another facility designated critical in subsection (b) of this section to operate. The director will review the application and if the applica- tion is approved, the facility shall submit Form CI-D. If the request is denied, the applicant may request a hearing. (d) Acknowledgment of critical status. Except as provided by subsection (e) of this section, an operator of a facility designated as critical under subsection (b) or (c) of this section shall acknowledge the facility's critical status by filing Form CI-D as provided in this subsec- tion. In the year 2022, the Form CI-D acknowledgment shall be filed bi-annually by January 15, 2022, and either September 1, 2022, or 30 days from the date the map is produced by the Texas Electricity Supply Chain Security and Mapping Committee, whichever is later. Beginning in 2023, the Form CI-D acknowledgment shall be filed bi-annually by March 1 and September 1 of each year. (e) Critical designation exception. (1) A facility listed in subsection (b) of this section that is not included on the electricity supply chain map produced by the Texas Electricity Supply Chain Security and Mapping Committee may apply for an exception. An applicant shall demonstrate with objective evidence a reasonable basis and justification in support of the applica- tion. The Director of the Critical Infrastructure Division will admin- istratively approve or deny a request for an exception. If the request is denied, the Division will notify the applicant and the applicant may request a hearing to challenge the denial. The party requesting the hear- ing shall have the burden of proof. (2) Examples of a reasonable basis and justification for which an exception may be granted include, but are not limited to, the following: (A) All of the natural gas produced at the facility is con- sumed on site; (B) All of the natural gas produced, processed, or de- livered by the facility is consumed outside of this state; (C) The facility does not provide gas for third-party use; (D) For saltwater disposal facilities and saltwater dis- posal pipelines, the facility or pipeline does not support a facility des- ignated critical in subsection (b)(1)(A)-(G) of this section; or (E) The electric entity delivering electricity to the facil- ity has provided notice that the facility's request for critical designation status was rejected, denied, or otherwise disapproved by the electric utility; provided, however, that the electric utility communicated its determination in writing, and the decision was for reasons other than the lack of correct identifying information or other administrative rea- sons. (3) An applicant for exception shall submit a Form CI-X exception application that identifies each facility for which an excep- tion is requested. The Form CI-X shall be accompanied by an excep-tion application fee. The amount of the fee is $150 as established in Chapter 81, Texas Natural Resources Code. (A) In the year 2022, the Form CI-X exception applica- tion shall be filed bi-annually by January 15, 2022, and either Septem- ber 1, 2022, or 30 days from the date the map is produced by the Texas Electricity Supply Chain Security and Mapping Committee, whichever is later. Beginning in 2023, the Form CI-X exception application shall be filed bi-annually by March 1 and September 1 of each year. (B) Once an operator has an approved Form CI-X on file with the Commission, the operator is not required to pay the $150 exception application fee when the operator updates the facilities iden- tified on its Form CI-X. (f) Providing critical customer information. A critical cus- tomer shall provide the critical customer information to the electric entities described in \u00a725.52 of this title and Texas Utilities Code \u00a738.074(b)(1) unless the critical customer is granted an exception under subsection (e) of this section. The critical customer information shall be provided in accordance with \u00a725.52 of this title. The operator shall certify on its Form CI-D that it has provided the critical customer information to its electric entity. (g) Confidentiality of information filed pursuant to this sec- tion. A person filing information with the Commission that the person contends is confidential by law shall notify the Commission on the ap- plicable form. If the Commission receives a request under the Texas Public Information Act (PIA), Texas Government Code, Chapter 552, for materials that have been designated confidential, the Commission will notify the filer of the request in accordance with the provisions of the PIA so that the filer can take action with the Office of the Attorney General to oppose release of the materials. (h) Exceptions not transferable. Exceptions are not transfer- able upon a change of operatorship. When a facility is transferred, both the transferor operator and the transferee operator shall ensure the transfer is reflected on each operator's Form CI-D or Form CI-X when the applicable form update is submitted in accordance with the bi-annual filing timelines in subsections (d) and (e) of this section. If the facility has an exception under subsection (e) of this section, the exception shall remain in effect until the next bi-annual filing deadline. If the transferee operator seeks to continue the exception beyond that time period, the transferee operator shall indicate the transferred facil- ity on the Form CI-X pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. (i) Failure to file or provide required information. An operator who fails to comply with this section may be subject to penalties un- der \u00a73.107 of this title (relating to Penalty Guidelines for Oil and Gas Violations).

PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION OF TEXAS CHAPTER 25. SUBSTANTIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS SUBCHAPTER B. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROTECTION 16 TAC \u00a725.43 The Public Utility Commission of Texas (commission) adopts amendments to 16 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) \u00a725.43, re- lating to Provider of Last Resort (POLR). The commission adopts this rule with changes to the proposed text as published in the September 30, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 6363). The amended rule updates the POLR formulas for resi- dential, and small and medium non-residential customer classes to reduce the likelihood that the POLR rate is lower than market rates. The rule will be republished. The amended provisions include \u00a725.43(j)(3) which would re- quire the Electricity Facts Label (EFL) for the POLR rate to be filed by the large service provider (LSP) on a monthly basis by the 10th of each month; \u00a725.43(m)(2)(A) and (B) which would revise the POLR rates applicable to residential, and small and medium non-residential customers; and \u00a725.43(m)(4) which would au- thorize the commission to direct an LSP to adjust the POLR rate under \u00a725.43(m)(2) upon a showing of good cause by an af- fected person. The commission received comments on the proposed rule from the REP Coalition and the Office of Public Utility Counsel (OPUC). General Comments in Support OPUC and the REP Coalition provided general comments in support of this proposed rulemaking. \u00a725.43(m)(2)(A)(iii) Proposed \u00a725.43(m)(2)(A)(iii) prohibits the LSP energy charge from exceeding 140% of the preceding month's LSP energy charge multiplied by an adjustment factor and for that ad- justment to be set to 1.0 every calendar year. Proposed \u00a725.43(m)(2)(A)(iii) also authorizes commission staff to file a recommendation for the commission to set a different adjust- ment factor and requires an LSP offering POLR service to declare the adjustment factor on its EFL. Residential Customer LSP Energy Charge Cap The REP Coalition argued that the cap under \u00a725.43(m)(2)(A)(iii) should be increased to 160%, rather than the proposed 140%, which would minimize the risk of market rates rising above the LSP POLR rate. The REP Coalition noted that a 140% ceiling would have been exceeded five times in 2022, while a 160% ceiling would have been exceeded only once. The REP Coalition asserted that a 140% cap on the LSP energy charge would also result in prepaid service being capped at a below-market price \"approximately 40% of the year.\" Commission Response The commission agrees with the REP Coalition that the LSP POLR rate should be slightly above market rates to account for the additional risk that LSPs face in terms of potentially having to assume a large number of unexpected customers after a mass transition to POLR event. The commission also agrees that the LSP POLR rate being capped below market rates has the addi- tional consequence of capping the rate for prepaid service below market rates. Accordingly, the commission modifies the rule to increase the cap on how much the residential LSP energy charge can increase each month from 140 percent to 160 percent. This will allow the monthly LSP POLR rate to adjust more quickly in response to actual market conditions while still providing cus- tomers with protection against the significant price spikes that a monthly formula could produce following events such as Winter Storm Uri. Residential LSP Customer Energy Charge Adjustment Factor The REP Coalition stated that language in the proposed rule re- garding the adjustment factor is unnecessary given the other rec- ommendations the REP Coalition made and should be deleted if the REP Coalition's recommendations are adopted. Commission Response The commission agrees with the REP Coalition's recom- mendation regarding deletion of the adjustment factor under \u00a725.43(m)(2)(A)(iii) and adopts its proposed language. Increas- ing the cap to 160% will allow the LSP POLR rate to more frequently remain above market rates without an adjustment factor. Removing the adjustment factor will also reduce the complexity of administering the formula. The REP Coalition expressed concern that, if the commission elects to implement the proposed adjustment factor, such a mechanism would be too time intensive and unwieldy to utilize when a cap adjustment becomes necessary. Specifically, a recommendation filing by commission staff, followed by commis- sion consideration and approval during an open meeting may take too much time to properly address the circumstances dur- ing a mass transition. The REP Coalition instead recommended authority to adjust the cap be delegated to the executive director so that the adjustment can be made in a more expedient man- ner. The REP Coalition further recommended clarifying that, under \u00a725.43(m)(2)(A)(iii), the default adjustment factor of 1.0 is a floor. The REP Coalition provided draft language consistent with its recommendation. Commission Response The adjustment factor for the residential customer POLR formula has been removed from the rule, rendering the REP Coalition's comments moot. The REP Coalition recommended the phrase \"LSP offering POLR service\" under \u00a725.43(m)(2)(A)(iii) (j)\" because POLR service is a \"temporary, last resort service that is not meant to be proactively offered by LSPs.\" The REP Coalition stated that the provision specifically applies to the largest LSP for each customer class or POLR area designated under \u00a725.43(j)(3) to supply the example EFL to commission staff and not all LSPs. The REP Coalition also indicated that the proposed language of \u00a725.43(m)(2)(A)(iii) would require an LSP to declare the adjustment factor on the EFL, but if the adjustment factor was exercised either by the commission or reset every calendar year, the LSP would be \"re- quired to create a second EFL shortly after creating the month's initial EFL.\" The REP Coalition noted that the inclusion of the adjustment factor is of minimal use to customers as the average prices disclosed on the EFL are typically the most helpful infor- mation. The REP Coalition provided draft language consistent ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7669 with its recommendation but noted that if the adjustment factor is not retained in the adopted rule, then the language relating to it under \u00a725.43(m)(2)(A)(iii) may be omitted entirely. Commission Response The adjustment factor for the residential customer POLR formula has been removed from the rule, rendering the REP Coalition's comments moot. \u00a725.43(m)(2)(B)(ii) and (iii) Proposed \u00a725.43(m)(2)(B)(ii) provides that the LSP customer charge component of the small and medium non-residential cus- tomer POLR rate formula is $0.025 cents per kWh. Proposed \u00a725.43(m)(2)(B)(iii) sets the LSP demand charge component of the small and medium non-residential customer POLR rate for- mula be $2.00 per kW, per month, for customers that have a demand meter, and $50.00 per month for customers that do not have a demand meter. Small and Medium Non-Residential Customer - LSP Customer Charge The REP Coalition noted that the proposed rule does not address any changes to the LSP customer charge for POLR service to small and medium non-residential customers un- der \u00a725.43(m)(2)(B)(ii). The REP Coalition recommended the LSP customer charge under \u00a725.43(m)(2)(B)(ii) be in- creased to $0.09 per kWh and the LSP demand charge under \u00a725.43(m)(2)(B)(iii) be deleted. The REP Coalition stated that not all small and medium non-residential customers have a de- mand meter and that the \"alternative $50 monthly fee for small and medium non-residential customers without a demand meter may not provide an equitable approximation.\" If the commission elects to retain the LSP demand charge, then the REP Coalition alternatively recommended increasing the customer charge by $0.03 to $0.055 to appropriately account for increased costs. Specifically, the REP Coalition indicated that the increased cus- tomer charge for small and medium non-residential customers is commensurate with the increase to the LSP customer charge for residential POLR service. Commission Response The commission agrees that it is appropriate to modify the small and medium non-residential LSP POLR formula consistent with the modification made to the residential formula. Both customer classes are subject to the same underlying wholesale market conditions. The commission modifies the rule consistent with the REP Coalition's primary proposal to increase the LSP cus- tomer charge $0.025 to $0.09 LSP demand charge under \u00a725.43(m)(2)(B)(iii). Fur- ther, eliminating the demand charge reduces the complexity of administering the formula. \u00a725.43(m)(2)(B)(iv) Proposed \u00a725.43(m)(2)(B)(iv) prohibits the LSP energy charge from exceeding 140% of the preceding month's LSP energy charge multiplied by the adjustment factor and for the cap to be set to 1.0 every calendar year. Proposed \u00a725.43(m)(2)(B)(iv) authorizes commission staff to file a recommendation for the commission to set a different adjustment factor and requires an LSP offering POLR service to declare the adjustment factor on its EFL. Small and Medium Non-Residential Customer - Energy Charge Cap The REP Coalition recommended the 140% cap under \u00a725.43(m)(2)(B)(iv) be increased to 160% for the same reasons provided in its comments related to \u00a725.43(m)(2)(A)(iii). Commission Response The commission agrees with the REP Coalition's proposal to in- crease the energy charge cap to 160% for the same reasons discussed in response to comments related to the Residential Customer LSP Energy Charge Cap. Small and Medium Non-Residential Customer - LSP Energy Charge Adjustment Factor If the commission declines to implement its primary recommen- dation to delete the adjustment factor, then the REP Coalition recommended that authority to adjust the cap be delegated to the executive director and clarify in \u00a725.43(m)(2)(B)(iv) that the default adjustment factor of 1.0 is a floor. The REP Coalition also recommended the phrase \"offering POLR service\" be removed from \u00a725.43(m)(2)(B)(iv) and that the provision be reworded to indicate it is relevant only to LSPs designated under subsection (j) by insertion of the phrase \"An LSP designated under subsec- tion (j).\"REP Coalition also recommended \u00a725.43(m)(2)(B)(iv) be revised to not require an LSP to issue a second EFL after the adjustment factor is exercised, either by the commission or every calendar year, and instead allowing the adjustment factor to be built into the prices on the EFL rather than include the adjustment factor as a separate variable on the EFL. The REP Coalition also noted that if the adjustment factor is not retained in the adopted rule, then the language relating to it under \u00a725.43(m)(2)(B)(iv) may be omitted entirely. The REP Coalition offered alternative draft language if the commission elects to maintain the LSP de- mand charge for the small and medium non-residential customer POLR rate, rather than increasing the LSP customer charge. Commission Response The adjustment factor for the small and medium non-commer- cial customer POLR formula has been removed from the rule, rendering the REP Coalition's comments moot. \u00a725.43(m)(4) - Good Cause Exception Proposed \u00a725.43(m)(4) provides, upon a showing of good cause by an affected person, the commission may direct an LSP to ad- just the rate under \u00a725.43(m)(2), if necessary to ensure that the rate is sufficient to allow an LSP to recover its costs of providing service. The REP Coalition expressed support for the authorization per- mitting any affected person to show good cause in support of an adjustment to the LSP POLR rates. However, the REP Coali- tion indicated that, because the LSP POLR rates serve as the cap on the price for prepaid products, \u00a725.43(m)(4) should be amended to reflect it is not solely applicable to LSPs, but to other affected REPs who \"may not have the information to prove an LSPs' costs.\" The REP Coalition also recommended inserting language in \u00a725.43(m)(4) that would clarify that any REP with a product subject to the POLR calculations under \u00a725.43(m) is permitted recover costs associated with the provision of service to customers served under such products. The REP Coalition provided draft language consistent with its recommendations. Commission Response The commission declines to modify the standard for adjusting the LSP POLR rate to ensuring that the rate is sufficient to allow \"any REP with products subject to the calculation(s) under subsection (m) to recover its costs of providing service\" as requested by the 47 TexReg 7670 November 18, 2022 Texas Register REP Coalition. REPs are not guaranteed cost recovery for any competitively-offered products, including prepaid products, and it would be inappropriate for the commission to consider an indi- vidual provider's costs of providing a competitive product when setting the LSP POLR rate. However, the commission agrees with the REP Coalition that providers of prepaid service are sub- ject to the LSP POLR rate cap but may not have access to the information required to support a good cause motion based on the proposed standard of \"if necessary to ensure that the rate is sufficient to allow an LSP to recover its costs of providing ser- vice.\" Accordingly, the commission modifies the rule to provide that the commission may direct an LSP to adjust the LSP POLR rate if necessary to ensure the rate is consistent with prevail- ing market conditions. This modification will allow LSP POLR providers and providers of prepaid products to support claims that the LSP POLR rate needs to be adjusted. The commission also agrees with the REP Coalition's recom- mendation to revise \u00a725.43(m)(4) to indicate the good cause rate adjustment is related to cost recovery associated with products subject to the POLR formula. This revision is consistent with the PURA \u00a739.107(g) provision that prepaid electric service sold to residential customers may not be sold at a price higher than the price charged by the provider of last resort. The REP Coalition also expressed concern that the existing good cause mechanism, which requires commission action, may be inefficient to address the severe circumstances such as those immediately preceding a mass transition as such action would have to be taken up at an open meeting.\" The REP Coalition ac- cordingly recommended that the authority to determine a good cause exception be delegated to the commission's executive di- rector with additional authority to shorten the notice window if circumstances require it. Commission Response The commission declines to delegate authority to the executive director at this time. The commission may, at a future time, del- egate authority to the executive director on its own initiative. This amendment is adopted under the following provisions of Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA): \u00a714.001, which provides the commission the general power to regulate and supervise the business of each public utility within its jurisdiction and to do any- thing specifically designated or implied by PURA that is neces- sary and convenient to the exercise of that power and jurisdic- tion; \u00a714.002, which provides the commission with the author- ity to make and enforce rules reasonably required in the exer- cise of its powers and jurisdiction; \u00a717.003, which requires elec- tric utilities and retail electric providers to provide clear and uni- form information about rates, terms, services, involuntary load shed procedures, critical designations, and procedures for ap- plying for critical designations; \u00a717.102, which directs the com- mission to adopt and enforce rules requiring that charges on an electric service provider's bill be clearly and easily identified, \u00a739.101, which requires the commission to ensure that retail customer protections are established that entitle a customer to safe, reliable, and reasonably priced electricity, and other pro- tections; and \u00a739.106, which requires that the commission des- ignate providers of last resort. Cross reference to statutes: Regulatory Act \u00a7\u00a714.001, 14.002, \u00a725.43. Provider of Last Resort (POLR). (a) Purpose. This section establishes the requirements for Provider of Last Resort (POLR) service and ensures that it is available to any requesting retail customer and any retail customer who is transferred to another retail electric provider (REP) by the Electric Re- liability Council of Texas (ERCOT) because the customer's REP failed to provide service to the customer or failed to meet its obligations to the independent organization. (b) Application. The provisions of this section relating to the selection of REPs providing POLR service apply to all REPs that are serving retail customers in transmission and distribution utility (TDU) service areas. This section does not apply when an electric cooperative or a municipally owned utility (MOU) designates a POLR provider for its certificated service area. However, this section is applicable when an electric cooperative delegates its authority to the commission in ac- cordance with subsection (r) of this section to select a POLR provider for the electric cooperative's service area. All filings made with the commission pursuant to this section, including filings subject to a claim of confidentiality, must be filed with the commission's Filing Clerk in accordance with the commission's Procedural Rules, Chapter 22, Sub- chapter E, of this title (relating to Pleadings and other Documents). (c) Definitions. The following terms when used in this section have the following meanings, unless the context indicates otherwise: (1) Affiliate--As defined in \u00a725.107 of this title (relating to Certification of Retail Electric Providers (REPs). (2) Basic firm service--Electric service that is not subject to interruption for economic reasons and that does not include value- added options offered in the competitive market. Basic firm service excludes, among other competitively offered options, emergency or back-up service, and stand-by service. For purposes of this definition, the phrase \"interruption for economic reasons\" does not mean discon- nection for non-payment. (3) Billing cycle--A period bounded by a start date and stop date that REPs and TDUs use to determine when a customer used elec- tric service. (4) Billing month--Generally a calendar accounting period (approximately 30 days) for recording revenue, which may or may not coincide with the period a customer's consumption is recorded through the customer's meter. (5) Business day--As defined by the ERCOT Protocols. (6) Large non-residential customer--A non-residential cus- tomer who had a peak demand in the previous 12-month period at or above one megawatt (MW). (7) Large service provider (LSP)--A REP that is designated to provide POLR service pursuant to subsection (j) of this section. (8) Market-based product -A month-to-month product that is either offered to or matches the rate of a product offered to non- POLR customers of the REP for the same TDU territory and customer class. A month-to-month contract may not contain a termination fee or penalty. For purposes of this section, a rate for residential customers that is derived by applying a positive or negative multiplier to the rate described in subsection (m)(2) of this section is not a market-based product. (9) Mass transition--The transfer of customers as rep- resented by ESI IDs from a REP to one or more POLR providers pursuant to a transaction initiated by the independent organization that carries the mass transition (TS) code or other code designated by the independent organization. (10) Medium non-residential customer--A non-residential retail customer who had a peak demand in the previous 12-month pe- riod of 50 kilowatt (kW) or greater, but less than 1,000 kW. ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7671 (11) POLR area--The service area of a TDU in an area where customer choice is in effect. (12) POLR provider--A volunteer retail electric provider (VREP) or LSP that may be required to provide POLR service pursuant to this section. (13) Residential customer--A retail customer classified as residential by the applicable TDU tariff or, in the absence of classi- fication under a tariff, a retail customer who purchases electricity for personal, family, or household purposes. (14) Transitioned customer--A customer as represented by ESI IDs that is served by a POLR provider as a result of a mass transi- tion under this section. (15) Small non-residential customer--A non-residential re- tail customer who had a peak demand in the previous 12-month period of less than 50 kW. (16) Voluntary retail electric provider (VREP)--A REP that has volunteered to provide POLR service pursuant to subsection (i) of this section. (d) POLR service. (1) There are two types of POLR providers: VREPs and LSPs. (2) For the purpose of POLR service, there are four classes of customers: residential, small non-residential, medium non-residen- tial, and large non-residential. (3) A VREP or LSP may be designated to serve any or all of the four customer classes in a POLR area. (4) A POLR provider must offer a basic, standard retail ser- vice package to customers it is designated to serve, which is limited to: (A) Basic firm service; and (B) Call center facilities available for customer in- quiries. (5) A POLR provider must, in accordance with \u00a725.108 of this title (relating to Financial Standards for Retail Electric Providers Regarding the Billing and Collection of Transition Charges), fulfill billing and collection duties for REPs that have defaulted on payments to the servicer of transition bonds or to TDUs. (6) Each LSP's customer billing for residential customers taking POLR service under a rate prescribed by subsection (m)(2) of this section must contain notice to the customer that other competitive products or services may be available from the LSP or another REP. The notice must also include contact information for the LSP, and the Power to Choose website, and must include a notice from the commis- sion in the form of a bill insert or a bill message with the header \"An Im- portant Message from the Public Utility Commission Regarding Your Electric Service\" addressing why the customer has been transitioned to an LSP, a description of the purpose and nature of POLR service, and explaining that more information on competitive markets can be found at www.powertochoose.org, or toll-free at 1-866-PWR-4-TEX (1-866-797-4839). (e) Standards of service. (1) An LSP designated to serve a class in a given POLR area must serve any eligible customer requesting POLR service or as- signed to the LSP pursuant to a mass transition in accordance with the Standard Terms of Service in subsection (f)(1) of this section for the provider customer's class. However, in lieu of providing terms of ser- vice to a transitioned customer under subsection (f) of this section and under a rate prescribed by subsection (m)(2) of this section an LSP may at its discretion serve the customer pursuant to a market-based month-to-month product, provided it serves all transitioned customers in the same class and POLR area pursuant to the product. (2) A POLR provider must abide by the applicable cus- tomer protection rules as provided for under Subchapter R of this chap- ter (relating to Customer Protection Rules for Retail Electric Service), except that if there is an inconsistency or conflict between this sec- tion and Subchapter R of this chapter, the provisions of this section apply. However, for the medium non-residential customer class, the customer protection rules as provided for under Subchapter R of this chapter do not apply, except for \u00a725.481 of this title (relating to Unau- thorized Charges), \u00a725.485(a) - (b) of this title (relating to Customer Access and Complaint Handling), and \u00a725.495 of this title (relating to Unauthorized Change of Retail Electric Provider). (3) An LSP that has received commission approval to des- ignate one of its affiliates to provide POLR service on behalf of the LSP pursuant to subsection (k) of this section must retain responsibility for the provision of POLR service by the LSP affiliate and remains liable for violations of applicable laws and commission rules and all finan- cial obligations of the LSP affiliate associated with the provisioning of POLR service on its behalf by the LSP affiliate. (f) Customer information. (1) The Standard Terms of Service prescribed in subpara- graphs (A) -(D) of this paragraph apply to POLR service provided by an LSP under a rate prescribed by subsection (m)(2) of this section. (A) Standard Terms of Service, POLR Provider Resi- dential Service: Figure: 16 TAC \u00a725.43(f)(1)(A) (No change.) (B) Standard Terms of Service, POLR Provider Small Non-Residential Service: Figure: 16 TAC \u00a725.43(f)(1)(B) (No change.) (C) Standard Terms of Service, POLR Provider Medium Non-Residential Service: Figure: 16 TAC \u00a725.43(f)(1)(C) (No change.) (D) Standard Terms of Service, POLR Provider Large Non-Residential Service: Figure: 16 TAC \u00a725.43(f)(1)(D) (No change.) (2) An LSP providing service under a rate prescribed by subsection (m)(2) of this section must provide each new customer the applicable Standard Terms of Service. Such Standard Terms of Service must be updated as required under \u00a725.475(f) of this title (relating to General Retail Electric Provider Requirements and Information Dis- closures to Residential and Small Commercial Customers). (g) General description of POLR service provider selection process. (1) Each REP must provide information to the commission in accordance with subsection (h)(1) of this section. Based on this in- formation, the commission's designated representative will designate REPs that are eligible to serve as POLR providers in areas of the state in which customer choice is in effect, except that the commission will not designate POLR providers in the service areas of MOUs or electric cooperatives unless an electric cooperative has delegated to the com- mission its authority to designate the POLR provider, in accordance with subsection (r) of this section. (2) POLR providers must serve two-year terms. The initial term for POLR service in areas of the state where retail choice is not in 47 TexReg 7672 November 18, 2022 Texas Register effect as of the effective date of the rule must be set at the time POLR providers are initially selected in such areas. (h) REP eligibility to serve as a POLR provider. In each even- numbered year, the commission will determine the eligibility of certi- fied REPs to serve as POLR providers for a term scheduled to com- mence in January of the next year. (1) Each REP must provide information to the commission necessary to establish its eligibility to serve as a POLR provider for the next term. A REP must file, by July 10th of each even-numbered year, by service area, information on the classes of customers it provides service to, and for each customer class, the number of ESI IDs the REP serves and the retail sales in megawatt-hours for the annual period ending March 31 of the current year. As part of that filing, a REP may request that the commission designate one of its affiliates to provide POLR service on its behalf pursuant to subsection (k) of this section in the event that the REP is designated as an LSP. The independent organization must provide to the commission the total number of ESI ID and total MWh data for each class. Each REP must also provide information on its technical capability and financial ability to provide service to additional customers in a mass transition. The commission's determination regarding eligibility of a REP to serve as POLR provider under the provisions of this section will not be considered confidential information. (2) Eligibility to be designated as a POLR provider is spe- cific to each POLR area and customer class. A REP is eligible to be designated a POLR provider for a particular customer class in a POLR area, unless: (A) A proceeding to revoke or suspend the REP's cer- tificate is pending at the commission, the REP's certificate has been suspended or revoked by the commission, or the REP's certificate is deemed suspended pursuant to \u00a725.107 of this title (relating to Certifi- cation of Retail Electric Providers (REPs)); (B) The sum of the numeric portion of the REP's per- centage of ESI IDs served and percentage of retail sales by MWhs in the POLR area, for the particular class, is less than 1.0; (C) The commission does not reasonably expect the REP to be able to meet the criteria set forth in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph during the entirety of the term; (D) On the date of the commencement of the term, the REP or its predecessor will not have served customers in Texas for at least 18 months; (E) The REP does not serve the applicable customer class, or does not have an executed delivery service agreement with the service area TDU; (F) The REP is certificated as an Option 2 REP under \u00a725.107 of this title; (G) The REP's customers are limited to its own affili- ates; (H) A REP files an affidavit stating that it does not serve small or medium non-residential customers, except for the low-usage sites of the REP's large non-residential customers, or commonly owned or franchised affiliates of the REP's large non-residential customers and opts out of eligibility for either, or both of the small or medium non- residential customer classes; or (I) The REP does not meet minimum financial, techni- cal and managerial qualifications established by the commission under \u00a725.107 of this title. (3) For each term, the commission will publish the names of all REPs eligible to serve as a POLR provider under this section for each customer class in each POLR area and will provide notice to REPs determined to be eligible to serve as a POLR provider. A REP may challenge its eligibility determination within five business days of the notice of eligibility by filing with the commission additional documentation that includes the specific data, the specific calculation, and a specific explanation that clearly illustrate and prove the REP's assertion. Commission staff will verify the additional documentation and, if accurate, reassess the REP's eligibility. Commission staff will notify the REP of any change in eligibility status within 10 business days of the receipt of the additional documentation. A REP may then appeal to the commission through a contested case if the REP does not agree with the staff determination of eligibility. The contested status will not delay the designation of POLR providers. (4) A standard form may be created by the commission for REPs to use in filing information concerning their eligibility to serve as a POLR provider. (5) If ERCOT or a TDU has reason to believe that a REP is no longer capable of performing POLR responsibilities, ERCOT or the TDU must make a filing with the commission detailing the basis for its concerns and must provide a copy of the filing to the REP that is the subject of the filing. If the filing contains confidential information, ER- COT or the TDU must file the confidential information in accordance with \u00a722.71 of this title (relating to Filing of Pleadings, Documents, and Other Materials). Commission staff will review the filing, and will request that the REP demonstrate that it still meets the qualifications to provide the service. The commission staff may initiate a proceeding with the commission to disqualify the REP from providing POLR ser- vice. No ESI IDs will be assigned to a POLR provider after the com- mission staff initiates a proceeding to disqualify the POLR provider, unless the commission by order confirms the POLR provider's desig- nation. (i) VREP list. Based on the information provided in accor- dance with this subsection and subsection (h) of this section, the com- mission will post the names of VREPs on its webpage, including the aggregate customer count offered by VREPs. A REP may submit a re- quest to be a VREP no earlier than June 1, and no later than July 31, of each even-numbered year unless otherwise determined by the ex- ecutive director. This filing must include a description of the REP's capabilities to serve additional customers as well as the REP's current financial condition in enough detail to demonstrate that the REP is ca- pable of absorbing a mass transition of customers without technically or financially distressing the REP and the specific information set out in this subsection. The commission's determination regarding eligibil- ity of a REP to serve as a VREP, under the provisions of this section, will not be considered confidential information. (1) A VREP must provide to the commission the name of the REP, the appropriate contact person with current contact informa- tion, which customer classes the REP is willing to serve within each POLR area, and the number of ESI IDs the REP is willing to serve by customer class and POLR area in each transition event. (2) A REP that has met the eligibility requirements of sub- section (h) of this section and provided the additional information set out in this subsection is eligible for designation as a VREP. (3) Commission staff will make an initial determination of the REPs that are to serve as a VREP for each customer class in each POLR area and publish their names. A REP may challenge its eligibil- ity determination within five business days of the notice of eligibility by submitting to commission staff additional evidence of its capability to serve as a VREP. Commission staff will reassess the REP's eligi- ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7673 bility and notify the REP of any change in eligibility status within 10 business days of the receipt of the additional documentation. A REP may then appeal to the commission through a contested case if the REP does not agree with the staff determination of eligibility. The contested status will not delay the designation of VREPs. (4) A VREP may file a request at any time to be removed from the VREP list or to modify the number of ESI IDs that it is will- ing to serve as a VREP. If the request is to increase the number of ESI IDs, it must provide information to demonstrate that it is capable of serving the additional ESI IDs, and the commission staff will make an initial determination, which is subject to an appeal to the commission, in accordance with the timelines specified in paragraph (3) of this sub- section. If the request is to decrease the number of ESI IDs, the request must be effective five calendar days after the request is filed with the commission; however, after the request becomes effective the VREP must continue to serve ESI IDs previously acquired through a mass transition event as well as ESI IDs the VREP acquires from a mass transition event that occurs during the five-day notice period. If in a mass transition a VREP is able to acquire more customers than it origi- nally volunteered to serve, the VREP may work with commission staff and ERCOT to increase its designation. Changes approved by commis- sion staff will be communicated to ERCOT and must be implemented for the current allocation if possible. (5) ERCOT or a TDU may challenge a VREP's eligibility. If ERCOT or a TDU has reason to believe that a REP is no longer ca- pable of performing VREP responsibilities, ERCOT or the TDU must make a filing with the commission detailing the basis for its concerns and must provide a copy of the filing to the REP that is the subject of the filing. If the filing contains confidential information, ERCOT or the TDU must file it in accordance with \u00a725.71 of this title (relating to General Procedures, Requirements and Penalties). Commission staff will review the filing of ERCOT and if commission staff concludes that the REP should no longer provide VREP service, it will request that the REP demonstrate that it still meets the qualifications to pro- vide the service. The commission staff may initiate a proceeding with the commission to disqualify the REP from providing VREP service. No ESI IDs will be assigned to a VREP after the commission staff ini- tiates a proceeding to disqualify the VREP, unless the commission by order confirms the VREP's designation. (j) LSPs. This subsection governs the selection and service of REPs as LSPs. (1) The REPs eligible to serve as LSPs must be determined based on the information provided by REPs in accordance with subsec- tion (h) of this section. However, for new TDU service areas that are transitioned to competition, the transition to competition plan approved by the commission may govern the selection of LSPs to serve as POLR providers. (2) In each POLR area, for each customer class, the com- mission will designate up to 15 LSPs. The eligible REPs that have the greatest market share based upon retail sales in megawatt-hours, by customer class and POLR area must be designated as LSPs. Commis- sion staff will designate the LSPs by October 15th of each even-num- bered year, based upon the data submitted to the commission under subsection (h) of this section. Designation as a VREP does not affect a REP's eligibility to also serve as an LSP. (3) For the purpose of calculating the POLR rate for each customer class in each POLR area, an EFL must be completed by the LSP that has the greatest market share in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection. The Electricity Facts Label (EFL) must be supplied to commission staff electronically for placement on the commission webpage by the 10th of each month. Where REP-specific information is required to be inserted in the EFL, the LSP supplying the EFL must note that such information is REP-specific. (4) An LSP serving transitioned residential and small non- residential customers under a rate prescribed by subsection (m)(2) of this section must move such customers to a market-based month-to- month product, with pricing for such product to be effective no later than either the 61st day of service by the LSP or beginning with the customer's next billing cycle date following the 60th day of service by the LSP. For each transition event, all such transitioned customers in the same class and POLR area must be served pursuant to the same product terms, except for those customers specified in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. (A) The notice required by \u00a725.475(d) of this title to inform the customers of the change to a market-based month-to-month product may be included with the notice required by subsection (t)(3) of this section or may be provided 14 days in advance of the change. If the \u00a725.475(d) notice is included with the notice required by subsection (t)(3) of this section, the LSP may state that either or both the terms of service document and EFL for the market-based month-to-month product will be provided at a later time, but no later than 14 days before their effective date. (B) The LSP is not required to transfer to a market- based product any transitioned customer who is delinquent in payment of any charges for POLR service to such LSP as of the 60th day of service. If such a customer becomes current in payments to the LSP, the LSP must move the customer to a market-based month-to-month product as described in this paragraph on the next billing cycle that occurs five business days after the customer becomes current. If the LSP does not plan to move customers who are delinquent in payment of any charges for POLR service as of the 60th day of service to a market-based month-to-month product, the LSP must inform the cus- tomer of that potential outcome in the notice provided to comply with \u00a725.475(d) of this title. (5) Upon a request from an LSP and a showing that the LSP will be unable to maintain its financial integrity if additional customers are transferred to it under this section, the commission may relieve an LSP from a transfer of additional customers. The LSP must continue providing continuous service until the commission issues an order re- lieving it of this responsibility. In the event the requesting LSP is re- lieved of its responsibility, the commission staff designee will, with 90 days' notice, designate the next eligible REP, if any, as an LSP, based upon the criteria in this subsection. (k) Designation of an LSP affiliate to provide POLR service on behalf of an LSP. (1) An LSP may request the commission designate an LSP affiliate to provide POLR service on behalf of the LSP either with the LSP's filing under subsection (h) of this section or as a separate filing in the current term project. The filing must be made at least 30 days prior to the date when the LSP affiliate is to begin providing POLR service on behalf of the LSP. To be eligible to provide POLR service on behalf of an LSP, the LSP affiliate must be certificated to provide retail electric service; have an executed delivery service agreement with the service area TDU; and meet the requirements of subsection (h)(2) of this section, with the exception of subsection (h)(2)(B), (C), (D), and (E) of this section as related to serving customers in the applicable customer class. (2) The request must include the name and certificate num- ber of the LSP affiliate, information demonstrating the affiliation be- tween the LSP and the LSP affiliate, and a certified agreement from an officer of the LSP affiliate stating that the LSP affiliate agrees to provide POLR service on behalf of the LSP. The request must also in- 47 TexReg 7674 November 18, 2022 Texas Register clude an affidavit from an officer of the LSP stating that the LSP will be responsible and indemnify any affected parties for all financial obli- gations of the LSP affiliate associated with the provisioning of POLR service on behalf of the LSP in the event that the LSP affiliate defaults or otherwise does not fulfill such financial obligations. (3) Commission staff will make an initial determination of the eligibility of the LSP affiliate to provide POLR service on behalf of an LSP and publish their names. The LSP or LSP affiliate may chal- lenge commission staff's eligibility determination within five business days of the notice of eligibility by submitting to commission staff ad- ditional evidence of its capability to provide POLR service on behalf of the LSP. Commission staff will reassess the LSP affiliate's eligibility and notify the LSP and LSP affiliate of any change in eligibility status within 10 business days of the receipt of the additional documentation. If the LSP or LSP affiliate does not agree with staff's determination of eligibility, either or both may then appeal the determination to the commission through a contested case. The LSP must provide POLR service during the pendency of the contested case. (4) ERCOT or a TDU may challenge an LSP affiliate's el- igibility to provide POLR service on behalf of an LSP. If ERCOT or a TDU has reason to believe that an LSP affiliate is not eligible or is not performing POLR responsibilities on behalf of an LSP, ERCOT or the TDU must make a filing with the commission detailing the basis for its concerns and must provide a copy of the filing to the LSP and the LSP affiliate that are the subject of the filing. If the filing contains confiden- tial information, ERCOT or the TDU must file it in accordance with \u00a725.71 of this title (relating to General Procedures, Requirements and Penalties). Commission staff will review the filing and if commission staff concludes that the LSP affiliate should not be allowed to provide POLR service on behalf of the LSP, it will request that the LSP affiliate demonstrate that it has the capability. The commission staff will review the LSP affiliate's filing and may initiate a proceeding with the com- mission to disqualify the LSP affiliate from providing POLR service. The LSP affiliate may continue providing POLR service to ESI IDs currently receiving the service during the pendency of the proceeding; however, the LSP must immediately assume responsibility to provide service under this section to customers who request POLR service, or are transferred to POLR service through a mass transition, during the pendency of the proceeding. (5) Designation of an affiliate to provide POLR service on behalf of an LSP must not change the number of ESI IDs served or the retail sales in megawatt-hours for the LSP for the reporting period nor does such designation relieve the LSP of its POLR service obligations in the event that the LSP affiliate fails to provide POLR service in ac- cordance with the commission rules. (6) The designated LSP affiliate must provide POLR ser- vice and all reports as required by the commission's rules on behalf of the LSP. (7) The methodology used by a designated LSP affiliate to calculate POLR rates must be consistent with the methodology used to calculate LSP POLR rates in subsection (m) of this section. (8) If an LSP affiliate designated to provide POLR service on behalf of an LSP cannot meet or fails to meet the POLR service requirements in applicable laws and Commission rules, the LSP must provide POLR service to any ESI IDs currently receiving the service from the LSP affiliate and to ESI IDs in a future mass transition or upon customer request. (9) An LSP may elect to reassume provisioning of POLR service from the LSP affiliate by filing a reversion notice with the com- mission and notifying ERCOT at least 30 days in advance. (l) Mass transition of customers to POLR providers. The transfer of customers to POLR providers must be consistent with this subsection. (1) ERCOT must first transfer customers to VREPs, up to the number of ESI IDs that each VREP has offered to serve for each customer class in the POLR area. ERCOT must use the VREP list to assign ESI IDs to the VREPs in a non-discriminatory manner, before assigning customers to the LSPs. A VREP must not be assigned more ESI IDs than it has indicated it is willing to serve pursuant to subsection (i) of this section. To ensure non-discriminatory assignment of ESI IDs to the VREPs, ERCOT must: Sort ESI IDs by POLR area; Sort ESI IDs by customer class; (C) Sort ESI IDs numerically; (D) Sort VREPs numerically by randomly generated number; and (E) Assign ESI IDs in numerical order to VREPs, in the order determined in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, in accordance with the number of ESI IDs each VREP indicated a willingness to serve pursuant to subsection (i) of this section. If the number of ESI IDs is less than the total that the VREPs indicated that they are willing to serve, each VREP must be assigned an equal number of ESI IDs, up to the number that each VREP indicated it was willing to serve for a given class and POLR area. (2) If the number of ESI IDs exceeds the amount the VREPs are designated to serve, ERCOT must assign remaining ESI IDs to LSPs in a non-discriminatory fashion, in accordance with their percentage of market share based upon retail sales in megawatt-hours, on a random basis within a class and POLR area, except that a VREP that is also an LSP that volunteers to serve at least 1% of its market share for a class of customers in a POLR area must be exempt from the LSP allocation up to 1% of the class and POLR area. To ensure non-discriminatory assignment of ESI IDs to the LSPs, ERCOT must: (A) Sort the ESI IDs in excess of the allocation to VREPs, by POLR area; (B) Sort ESI IDs in excess of the allocation to VREPs, by customer class; (C) Sort ESI IDs in excess of the allocation to VREPs, numerically; (D) Sort LSPs, except LSPs that volunteered to serve 1% of their market share as a VREP, numerically by MWhs served; (E) Assign ESI IDs that represent no more than 1% of the total market for that POLR area and customer class less the ESI IDs assigned to VREPs that volunteered to serve at least 1% of their market share for each POLR area and customer class in numerical order to LSPs designated in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, in proportion to the percentage of MWhs served by each LSP to the total MWhs served by all LSPs; (F) Sort LSPs, including any LSPs previously excluded under subparagraph (D) of this paragraph; and (G) Assign all remaining ESI IDs in numerical order to LSPs in proportion to the percentage of MWhs served by each LSP to the total MWhs served by all LSPs. (3) Each mass transition must be treated as a separate event. (m) Rates applicable to POLR service. ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7675 (1) A VREP must provide service to customers using a market-based, month-to-month product. The VREP must use the same market-based, month-to-month product for all customers in a mass transition that are in the same class and POLR area. (2) Subparagraphs (A) -(C) of this paragraph establish the maximum rate for POLR service charged by an LSP. An LSP may charge a rate less than the maximum rate if it charges the lower rate to all customers in a mass transition that are in the same class and POLR area. (A) Residential customers. The LSP rate for the resi- dential customer class must be determined by the following formula: LSP rate (in $ per kWh) = (Non-bypassable charges + LSP customer charge + LSP energy charge) / kWh used, where: (i) Non-bypassable charges must be all TDU charges and credits for the appropriate customer class in the applicable service territory and other charges including ERCOT administrative charges, nodal fees or surcharges, reliability unit commitment (RUC) capacity short charges attributable to LSP load, and applicable taxes from various taxing or regulatory authorities, multiplied by the level of kWh and kW used, where appropriate. (ii) LSP customer charge must be $0.09 per kWh. (iii) Beginning on the 10th of each month, an LSP energy charge must be the average of the actual Real-Time Settlement Point Prices (RTSPPs) for the applicable load zone for the preceding calendar month (the historical average RTSPP) multiplied by the num- ber of kWhs the customer used during that billing period and further multiplied by 120%. The LSP energy charge must not exceed 160%of the preceding calendar month's LSP energy charge. The applicable load zone will be the load zone located partially or wholly in the cus- tomer's TDU service territory with the highest average under the his- torical average RTSPP calculation. (iv) \"Number of kWhs the customer used\" is based on usage data provided to the POLR by the TDU. (B) Small and medium non-residential customers. The LSP rate for the small and medium non-residential customer classes must be determined by the following formula: LSP rate (in $ per kWh) = (Non-bypassable charges + LSP customer charge + LSP energy charge) / kWh used, where: (i) Non-bypassable charges must be all TDU charges and credits for the appropriate customer class in the applicable service territory, and other charges including ERCOT administrative charges, nodal fees or surcharges, RUC capacity short charges at- tributable to LSP load, and applicable taxes from various taxing or regulatory authorities, multiplied by the level of kWh and kW used, where appropriate. (ii) LSP customer charge must be $0.09 per kWh. (iii) Beginning on the 10th of each month, LSP en- ergy charge must be the average of the actual RTSPPs for the applicable load zone for the preceding calendar month multiplied by the number of kWhs the customer used during that billing period and further mul- tiplied by 125%. The LSP energy charge must not exceed 160% of the preceding calendar month's LSP energy charge. The applicable load zone will be the load zone located partially or wholly in the customer's TDU service territory with the highest average under the historical av- erage RTSPP calculation. (iv) \"Number of kWhs the customer used\" is based on usage data provided to the POLR by the TDU. (C) Large non-residential customers. The LSP rate for the large non-residential customer class must be determined by the fol- lowing formula: LSP rate (in $ per kWh) = (Non-bypassable charges + LSP customer charge + LSP demand charge + LSP energy charge) / kWh used, where: (i) Non-bypassable charges must be all TDU charges and credits for the appropriate customer class in the applicable service territory, and other charges including ERCOT administrative charges, nodal fees or surcharges, RUC capacity short charges at- tributable to LSP load, and applicable taxes from various taxing or regulatory authorities, multiplied by the level of kWh and KW used, where appropriate. (ii) LSP customer charge must be $2,897.00 per month. (iii) LSP demand charge must be $6.00 per kW, per month. (iv) LSP energy charge must be the appropriate RT- SPP, determined on the basis of 15-minute intervals, for the customer multiplied by 125%, multiplied by the level of kilowatt-hours used. The energy charge must have a floor of $7.25 per MWh. (3) If in response to a complaint or upon its own investi- gation, the commission determines that an LSP failed to charge the appropriate rate prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subsection, and as a result overcharged its customers, the LSP must issue refunds to the specific customers who were overcharged. (4) On a showing of good cause by an affected person, the commission may direct an LSP to adjust the rate prescribed by para- graph (2) of this subsection, if necessary to ensure that the rate is con- sistent with prevailing market conditions. Notwithstanding any other commission rule to the contrary, such rates may be adjusted on an in- terim basis for good cause shown and after at least 10 business days' notice and an opportunity for hearing on the request for interim re- lief. Any adjusted rate must be applicable to all LSPs charging the rate prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subsection to the specific customer class, within the POLR area that is subject to the adjustment. (5) For transitioned customers, the customer and demand charges associated with the rate prescribed by paragraph (3) of this subsection must be pro-rated for partial month usage if a large non- residential customer switches from the LSP to a REP of choice. (n) Challenges to customer assignments. A POLR provider is not obligated to serve a customer within a customer class or a POLR area for which the REP is not designated as a POLR provider, after a successful challenge of the customer assignment. A POLR provider must use the ERCOT market variance resolution tool to challenge a customer class assignment with the TDU. The TDU must make the final determination based upon historical usage data and not premise type. If the customer class assignment is changed and a different POLR provider for the customer is determined appropriate, the customer must then be served by the appropriate POLR provider. Back dated transac- tions may be used to correct the POLR assignment. (o) Limitation on liability. A POLR provider must make rea- sonable provisions to provide service under this section to any ESI IDs currently receiving the service and to ESI IDs obtained in a future mass transition or served upon customer request; however, liabilities not ex- cused by reason of force majeure or otherwise must be limited to direct, actual damages. (1) Neither the customer nor the POLR provider must be liable to the other for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary, or 47 TexReg 7676 November 18, 2022 Texas Register indirect damages. These limitations apply without regard to the cause of any liability or damage. (2) In no event will ERCOT or a POLR provider be liable for damages to any REP, whether under tort, contract or any other the- ory of legal liability, for transitioning or attempting to transition a cus- tomer from such REP to the POLR provider to carry out this section, or for marketing, offering or providing competitive retail electric service to a customer taking service under this section from the POLR provider. (p) REP obligations in a transition of customers to POLR ser- vice. (1) A customer may initiate service with an LSP by re- questing such service at the rate prescribed by subsection (m)(2) of this section with any LSP that is designated to serve the requesting cus- tomer's customer class within the requesting customer's service area. An LSP cannot refuse a customer's request to make arrangements for POLR service, except as otherwise permitted under this title. (2) The POLR provider is responsible for obtaining re- sources and services needed to serve a customer once it has been notified that it is serving that customer. The customer is responsible for charges for service under this section at the rate in effect at that time. (3) If a REP terminates service to a customer, or transitions a customer to a POLR provider, the REP is financially responsible for the resources and services used to serve the customer until it notifies the independent organization of the termination or transition of the service and the transfer to the POLR provider is complete. (4) The POLR provider is financially responsible for all costs of providing electricity to customers from the time the transfer or initiation of service is complete until such time as the customer ceases taking service under this section. (5) A defaulting REP whose customers are subject to a mass transition event must return the customers' deposits within seven calendar days of the initiation of the transition. (6) ERCOT must create a single standard file format and a standard set of customer billing contact data elements that, in the event of a mass transition, must be used by the exiting REP and the POLRs to send and receive customer billing contact information. The process, as developed by ERCOT must be tested on a periodic basis. Each REP must submit timely, accurate, and complete files, as required by ER- COT in a mass transition event, as well as for periodic testing. The commission will establish a procedure for the verification of customer information submitted by REPs to ERCOT. ERCOT must notify the commission if any REP fails to comply with the reporting requirements in this subsection. (7) When customers are to be transitioned or assigned to a POLR provider, the POLR provider may request usage and demand data, and customer contact information including email, telephone number, and address from the appropriate TDU and from ERCOT, once the transition to the POLR provider has been initiated. Customer proprietary information provided to a POLR provider in accordance with this section must be treated as confidential and must only be used for mass transition related purposes. (8) Information from the TDU and ERCOT to the POLR providers must be provided in Texas SET format when Texas SET transactions are available. However, the TDU or ERCOT may sup- plement the information to the POLR providers in other formats to ex- pedite the transition. The transfer of information in accordance with this section must not constitute a violation of the customer protection rules that address confidentiality. (9) A POLR provider may require a deposit from a cus- tomer that has been transitioned to the POLR provider to continue to serve the customer. Despite the lack of a deposit, the POLR provider is obligated to serve the customer transitioned or assigned to it, beginning on the service initiation date of the transition or assignment, and con- tinuing until such time as any disconnection request is effectuated by the TDU. A POLR provider may make the request for deposit before it begins serving the customer, but the POLR provider must begin provid- ing service to the customer even if the service initiation date is before it receives the deposit - if any deposit is required. A POLR provider must not disconnect the customer until the appropriate time period to submit the deposit has elapsed. For the large non-residential customer class, a POLR provider may require a deposit to be provided in three calendar days. For the residential customer class, the POLR provider may require a deposit to be provided after 15 calendar days of service if the customer received 10 days' notice that a deposit was required. For all other customer classes, the POLR provider may require a deposit to be provided in 10 calendar days. The POLR provider may waive the deposit requirement at the customer's request if deposits are waived in a non-discriminatory fashion. If the POLR provider obtains sufficient data, it must determine whether a residential customer has satisfactory credit based on the criteria the POLR provider routinely applies to its other residential customers. If the customer has satisfactory credit, the POLR provider must not request a deposit from the residential cus- tomer. (A) At the time of a mass transition, the executive direc- tor or staff designated by the executive director will distribute available proceeds from an irrevocable stand-by letter of credit in accordance with the priorities established in \u00a725.107(f)(6) of this title. For a REP that has obtained a current list from the Low Income List Adminis- trator (LILA) that identifies low-income customers, these funds must first be used to provide deposit payment assistance for that REP's tran- sitioned low-income customers. The Executive Director or staff de- signee will, at the time of a transition event, determine the reasonable deposit amount up to $400 per customer ESI ID, unless good cause ex- ists to increase the level of the reasonable deposit amount above $400. Such reasonable deposit amount may take into account factors such as typical residential usage and current retail residential prices, and, if fully funded, must satisfy in full the customers' initial deposit obliga- tion to the VREP or LSP. (B) For a REP that has obtained a current list from the LILA that identifies low-income customers, the Executive Director or the staff designee will distribute available proceeds pursuant to \u00a725.107(f)(6) of this title to the VREPs proportionate to the number of customers they received in the mass transition, who at the time of the mass transition were identified as low-income customers by the current LILA list, up to the reasonable deposit amount set by the Executive Director or staff designee. If funds remain available after distribution to the VREPs, the remaining funds must be distributed to the appropriate LSPs by dividing the amount remaining by the number of low income customers as identified in the LILA list that are allocated to LSPs, up to the reasonable deposit amount set by the Executive Director or staff designee. (C) If the funds distributed in accordance with \u00a725.107(f)(6) of this title do not equal the reasonable deposit amount determined, the VREP and LSP may request from the customer pay- ment of the difference between the reasonable deposit amount and the amount distributed. Such difference must be collected in accordance with \u00a725.478(e)(3) of this title (relating to Credit Requirements and Deposits). (D) Notwithstanding \u00a725.478(d) of this title, 90 days after the transition date, the VREP or LSP may request payment of ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7677 an amount that results in the total deposit held being equal to what the VREP or LSP would otherwise have charged a customer in the same customer class and service area in accordance with \u00a725.478(e) of this title, at the time of the transition. (10) On the occurrence of one or more of the following events, ERCOT must initiate a mass transition to POLR providers, of all of the customers served by a REP: (A) Termination of the Load Serving Entity (LSE) or Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) Agreement for a REP with ERCOT; (B) Issuance of a commission order recognizing that a REP is in default under the TDU Tariff for Retail Delivery Service; (C) Issuance of a commission order de-certifying a REP; (D) Issuance of a commission order requiring a mass transition to POLR providers; (E) Issuance of a judicial order requiring a mass transi- tion to POLR providers; and (F) At the request of a REP, for the mass transition of all of that REP's customers. (11) A REP must not use the mass transition process in this section as a means to cease providing service to some customers, while retaining other customers. A REP's improper use of the mass transition process may lead to de-certification of the REP. (12) ERCOT may provide procedures for the mass transi- tion process, consistent with this section. (13) A mass transition under this section must not override or supersede a switch request made by a customer to switch an ESI ID to a new REP of choice, if the request was made before a mass transition is initiated. If a switch request has been made but is scheduled for any date after the next available switch date, the switch must be made on the next available switch date. (14) ERCOT must identify customers who are mass tran- sitioned for a period of 60 calendar days. The identification must ter- minate at the first completed switch or at the end of the 60-day period, whichever is first. If necessary, ERCOT system changes or new trans- actions must be implemented no later than 14 months from the effective date of this section to communicate that a customer was acquired in a mass transition and is not charged the out-of-cycle meter read pursuant to paragraph (16) of this subsection. (15) In the event of a transition to a POLR provider or away from a POLR provider to a REP of choice, the switch notification no- tice detailed in \u00a725.474(l) of this title (relating to Selection of Retail Electric Provider) is not required. (16) In a mass transition event, the ERCOT initiated trans- actions must request an out-of-cycle meter read for the associated ESI IDs for a date two calendar days after the calendar date ERCOT ini- tiates such transactions to the TDU. If an ESI ID does not have the capability to be read in a fashion other than a physical meter read, the out-of-cycle meter read may be estimated. An estimated meter read for the purpose of a mass transition to a POLR provider must not be considered a break in a series of consecutive months of estimates, but must not be considered a month in a series of consecutive estimates performed by the TDU. A TDU must create a regulatory asset for the TDU fees associated with a mass transition of customers to a POLR provider pursuant to this subsection. Upon review of reasonableness and necessity, a reasonable level of amortization of such regulatory as- set must be included as a recoverable cost in the TDU's rates in its next rate case or such other rate recovery proceeding as deemed necessary. The TDU must not bill as a discretionary charge, the costs included in this regulatory asset, which must consist of the following: (A) fees for out-of-cycle meter reads associated with the mass transition of customers to a POLR provider; and (B) fees for the first out-of-cycle meter read provided to a customer who transfers away from a POLR provider, when the out- of-cycle meter read is performed within 60 calendar days of the date of the mass transition and the customer is identified as a transitioned customer. (17) In the event the TDU estimates a meter read for the purpose of a mass transition, the TDU must perform a true-up evalua- tion of each ESI ID after an actual meter reading is obtained. Within 10 days after the actual meter reading is obtained, the TDU must cal- culate the actual average kWh usage per day for the time period from the most previous actual meter reading occurring prior to the estimate for the purpose of a mass transition to the most current actual meter reading occurring after the estimate for the purpose of mass transition. If the average daily estimated usage sent to the exiting REP is more than 50% greater than or less than the average actual kWh usage per day, the TDU must promptly cancel and re-bill both the exiting REP and the POLR using the average actually daily usage. (q) Termination of POLR service provider status. (1) The commission may revoke a REP's POLR status after notice and opportunity for hearing: (A) If the POLR provider fails to maintain REP certifi- cation; (B) If the POLR provider fails to provide service in a manner consistent with this section; (C) The POLR provider fails to maintain appropriate fi- nancial qualifications; or (D) For other good cause. (2) If an LSP defaults or has its status revoked before the end of its term, after a review of the eligibility criteria, the commission staff designee will, as soon as practicable, designate the next eligible REP, if any, as an LSP, based on the criteria in subsection (j) of this section. (3) At the end of the POLR service term, the outgoing LSP must continue to serve customers who have not selected another REP. (r) Electric cooperative delegation of authority. An electric co- operative that has adopted customer choice may select to delegate to the commission its authority to select POLR providers under PURA \u00a741.053(c) in its certificated service area in accordance with this sec- tion. After notice and opportunity for comment, the commission will, at its option, accept or reject such delegation of authority. If the com- mission accepts the delegation of authority, the following conditions apply: (1) The board of directors must provide the commission with a copy of a board resolution authorizing such delegation of au- thority; (2) The delegation of authority must be made at least 30 calendar days prior to the time the commission issues a publication of notice of eligibility; (3) The delegation of authority must be for a minimum pe- riod corresponding to the period for which the solicitation must be made; 47 TexReg 7678 November 18, 2022 Texas Register (4) The electric cooperative wishing to delegate its author- ity to designate a continuous provider must also provide the commis- sion with the authority to apply the selection criteria and procedures described in this section in selecting the POLR providers within the electric cooperative's certificated service area; and (5) If there are no competitive REPs offering service in the electric cooperative certificated area, the commission must automati- cally reject the delegation of authority. (s) Reporting requirements. Each LSP that serves customers under a rate prescribed by subsection (m)(2) of this section must file the following information with the commission on a quarterly basis begin- ning January of each year in a project established by the commission for the receipt of such information. Each quarterly report must be filed within 30 calendar days of the end of the quarter. (1) For each month of the reporting quarter, each LSP must report the total number of new customers acquired by the LSP under this section and the following information regarding these customers: (A) The number of customers from whom a deposit was requested pursuant to the provisions of \u00a725.478 of this title, and the average amount of deposit requested; (B) The number of customers from whom a deposit was received, including those who entered into deferred payment plans for the deposit, and the average amount of the deposit; (C) The number of customers whose service was phys- ically disconnected pursuant to the provisions of \u00a725.483 of this title (relating to Disconnection of Service) for failure to pay a required de- posit; and (D) Any explanatory data or narrative necessary to ac- count for customers that were not included in either subparagraph (B) or (C) of this paragraph. (2) For each month of the reporting quarter each LSP must report the total number of customers to whom a disconnection notice was issued pursuant to the provisions of \u00a725.483 of this title and the following information regarding those customers: (A) The number of customers who entered into a de- ferred payment plan, as defined by \u00a725.480(j) of this title (relating to Bill Payment and Adjustments) with the LSP; (B) The number of customers whose service was phys- ically disconnected pursuant to \u00a725.483 of this title; (C) The average amount owed to the LSP by each dis- connected customer at the time of disconnection; and (D) Any explanatory data or narrative necessary to ac- count for customers that are not included in either subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph. (3) For the entirety of the reporting quarter, each LSP must report, for each customer that received POLR service, the TDU and customer class associated with the customer's ESI ID, the number of days the customer received POLR service, and whether the customer is currently the LSP's customer. (t) Notice of transition to POLR service to customers. When a customer is moved to POLR service, the customer must be provided notice of the transition by ERCOT, the REP transitioning the customer, and the POLR provider. The ERCOT notice must be provided within two days of the time ERCOT and the transitioning REP know that the customer must be transitioned and customer contact information is available. If ERCOT cannot provide notice to customers within two days, it must provide notice as soon as practicable. The POLR provider must provide the notice required by paragraph (3) of this subsection to commission staff at least 48 hours before it is provided to customers, and must provide the notice to transitioning customers as soon as prac- ticable. The POLR provider must email the notice to the commission staff members designated for receipt of the notice. (1) ERCOT notice methods must include a post-card, con- taining the official commission seal with language and format approved by the commission. ERCOT must notify transitioned customers with an automated phone-call and email to the extent the information to con- tact the customer is available pursuant to subsection (p)(6) of this sec- tion. ERCOT must study the effectiveness of the notice methods used and report the results to the commission. (2) Notice by the REP from which the customer is trans- ferred must include: (A) The reason for the transition; (B) A contact number for the REP; (C) A statement that the customer will receive a sep- arate notice from the POLR provider that must disclose the date the POLR provider must begin serving the customer; (D) Either the customer's deposit plus accrued interest, or a statement that the deposit must be returned within seven days of the transition; (E) A statement that the customer can leave the as- signed service by choosing a competitive product or service offered by the POLR provider, or another competitive REP, as well as the following statement: \"If you would like to see offers from different retail electric providers, please access www.powertochoose.org, or call toll-free 1-866-PWR-4-TEX (1-866-797-4839) for a list of providers in your area;\" (F) For residential customers, notice from the commis- sion in the form of a bill insert or a bill message with the header \"An Im- portant Message from the Public Utility Commission Regarding Your Electric Service\" addressing why the customer has been transitioned to another REP, the continuity of service purpose, the option to choose a different competitive provider, and information on competitive markets to be found at www.powertochoose.org, or toll-free at 1-866-PWR-4- TEX (1-866-797-4839); (G) If applicable, a description of the activities that the REP will use to collect any outstanding payments, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, debt collection agencies, small claims court, and other remedies allowed by law, if the customer does not pay or make acceptable payment arrangements with the REP; and (H) Notice to the customer that after being transitioned to POLR service, the customer may accelerate a switch to another REP by requesting a special or out-of-cycle meter read. (3) Notice by the POLR provider must include: (A) The date the POLR provider began or will begin serving the customer and a contact number for the POLR provider; (B) A description of the POLR provider's rate for ser- vice. In the case of a notice from an LSP that applies the pricing of subsection (m)(2) of this section, a statement that the price is generally higher than available competitive prices; (C) The deposit requirements of the POLR provider and any applicable deposit waiver provisions and a statement that, if the customer chooses a different competitive product or service offered by the POLR provider, a REP affiliated with the POLR provider, or another competitive REP, a deposit may be required; ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7679 (D) A statement that the additional competitive prod- ucts or services may be available through the POLR provider, a REP affiliated with the POLR provider, or another competitive REP, as well as the following statement: \"If you would like to choose a different retail electric provider, please access www.powertochoose.org, or call toll-free 1-866-PWR-4-TEX (1-866-797-4839) for a list of providers in your area;\" (E) The applicable Terms of Service and Electricity Facts Label (EFL); and (F) For residential customers that are served by an LSP under a rate prescribed by subsection (m)(2) of this section, a notice to the customer that after being transitioned to service from a POLR provider, the customer may accelerate a switch to another REP by re- questing a special or out-of-cycle meter read. (u) Market notice of transition to POLR service. ERCOT must notify all affected Market Participants and the Retail Market Subcom- mittee (RMS) email listserv of a mass transition event within the same day of an initial mass-transition call after the call has taken place.

The POLR provider must comply with the applicable customer protection rules as provided for under Subchapter R of this chapter, except as otherwise stated in this section. To ensure continuity of service, service under this section must begin when the customer's transition to the POLR provider is complete. A customer deposit is not a prerequisite for the initiation of service under this section. Once service has been initiated, a customer deposit may be required to prevent disconnection. Disconnection for failure to pay a deposit may not occur until after the proper notice and after that appropriate payment period detailed in \u00a725.478 of this title has elapsed, except where otherwise noted in this section.

TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF LICENSING AND REGULATION CHAPTER 73. ELECTRICIANS 16 TAC \u00a773.100 The Texas Commission of Licensing and Regulation (Commis- sion) adopts amendments to an existing rule at 16 Texas Ad- ministrative Code (TAC), Chapter 73, \u00a773.100, regarding the Electricians program, without changes to the proposed text as published in the June 17, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3522). The rule will not be republished. EXPLANATION OF AND JUSTIFICATION FOR THE RULES The rules under 16 TAC Chapter 73 implement Texas Occupa- tions Code, Chapter 1305, Electricians. Pursuant to Occupations Code, Chapter 1305, \u00a71305.101(a)(2), the Commission is required to adopt the National Electrical Code (NEC) every three years \"as the electrical code for the state.\" The Commission has adopted the 2020 NEC in its entirety by rule at 16 TAC, Chapter 73, \u00a773.100, Technical Requirements. Section 90.4 of the 2020 NEC authorizes the Department to waive spe- cific code requirements when doing so will not have a negative impact on safety. Section 210.8(F) of the NEC requires certain outdoor outlets to have ground-fault circuit-interrupter (GFCI) protection. An in- compatibility between most GFCI products on the market and common air-conditioning and heating equipment has resulted in that equipment failing by persistently tripping circuit breakers. Recent rulemaking by the Department has delayed the imple- mentation of Section 210.8(F) until January 1, 2023, in order to allow equipment manufacturers to correct this incompatibility. See 16 TAC \u00a773.100(b). However, because this incompatibility will not be resolved by January 1, 2023, the adopted rule will ex- clude Section 210.8(F) from the Department's implementation of the 2020 NEC altogether. The summer heat and winter cold pose a serious threat to Texas residents whose air conditioning or heating systems have failed or are malfunctioning. Adopting the proposed rule would help keep Texas residents safe by ensuring installed air conditioning and heating systems are not subject to failure due to equipment incompatibility. Additionally, the Department's technical experts have confirmed that adopting the proposed rule would not have a negative impact on safety. SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY The adopted rule amends \u00a773.100(b) to state that compliance with Section 210.8(F) of the 2020 NEC is not required. PUBLIC COMMENTS The Department drafted and distributed the proposed rules to persons internal and external to the agency. The proposed rules were published in the June 17, 2022, issue of the Texas Register 47 TexReg 7680 November 18, 2022 Texas Register (47 TexReg 3522). The public comment period closed on July 18, 2022. The Department received comments from four inter- ested parties on the proposed rules. The public comments are summarized below. Comment: Two commenters expressed their support for the pro- posed rule as published. Department Response: The Department appreciates these comments. Comment: One commenter stated that the Department was \"moving in the right direction\" by adopting the proposed rules. The commenter stated that requiring GFCI protection for air conditioning equipment is a bad requirement that is not practical and that imposes extreme costs. Department Response: The Department appreciates the com- ment. Comment: One commenter stated simply, \"Keep the rule in place.\" Department Response: The Department was unable to deter- mine whether the commenter was in favor of or against adopting the proposed rule. The Department appreciates the comment. ADVISORY BOARD RECOMMENDATIONS AND COMMIS- SION ACTION The Electrical Safety and Licensing Advisory Board met on Au- gust 25, 2022, to discuss the proposed rules and the public com- ments received. The Advisory Board recommended that the Commission adopt the proposed rules as published in the Texas Register. At its meeting on October 18, 2022, the Commission adopted the proposed rules as recommended by the Advisory Board. STATUTORY AUTHORITY The adopted rule is adopted under Texas Occupations Code, Chapters 51 and 1305, which authorize the Texas Commission of Licensing and Regulation, the Department's governing body, to adopt rules as necessary to implement these chapters and any other law establishing a program regulated by the Department. The statutory provisions affected by the adopted rule are those set forth in Texas Occupations Code, Chapters 51 and 1305. No other statutes, articles, or codes are affected by the adopted rule. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the adop- tion and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal au- thority.

AIR CONDITIONING AND REFRIGERATION 16 TAC \u00a775.100 The Texas Commission of Licensing and Regulation (Commis- sion) adopts amendments to an existing rule at 16 Texas Ad- ministrative Code (TAC), Chapter 75, \u00a775.100, regarding the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Contractors program, without changes to the proposed text as published in the July 8, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3864). The rule will not be republished. EXPLANATION OF AND JUSTIFICATION FOR THE RULES The rules under 16 TAC Chapter 75 implement Texas Occupa- tions Code, Chapter 1302, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Contractors. Pursuant to 16 TAC, Chapter 75, \u00a775.100(a)(4), electrical work performed by air conditioning and refrigeration contractors must be performed in accordance with the 2020 National Electrical Code (NEC). Section 90.4 of the 2020 NEC authorizes the De- partment to waive specific code requirements when doing so will not have a negative impact on safety. Section 210.8(F) of the NEC requires certain outdoor outlets to have ground-fault circuit-interrupter (GFCI) protection. An in- compatibility between most GFCI products on the market and common air-conditioning and heating equipment has resulted in that equipment failing by persistently tripping circuit breakers. Recent rulemaking by the Department has delayed the imple- mentation of Section 210.8(F) until January 1, 2023, in order to allow equipment manufacturers to correct this incompatibility. See 16 TAC \u00a775.100(a)(5). However, because this incompatibil- ity will not be resolved by January 1, 2023, the proposed rule will exclude Section 210.8(F) from the Department's implementation of the 2020 NEC altogether. The summer heat and winter cold pose a serious threat to Texas residents whose air conditioning or systems have failed or are malfunctioning. Adopting the proposed rule would help keep Texas residents safe by ensuring installed air conditioning and heating systems are not subject to failure due to equipment in- compatibility. Additionally, the Department's technical experts have confirmed that adopting the proposed rule would not have a negative impact on safety. SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY The adopted rule amends \u00a775.100(a)(5) to state that compliance with Section 210.8(F) of the 2020 NEC is not required. PUBLIC COMMENTS The Department drafted and distributed the proposed rules to persons internal and external to the agency. The proposed rules were published in the July 8, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3864). The public comment period closed on Au- gust 8, 2022. The Department received comments from twelve interested parties on the proposed rules. The public comments are summarized below. Comment: Ten commenters expressed their support for the pro- posed rule as published. Department Response: The Department appreciates these comments. Comment: One commenter stated that Texas should have a law requiring all residences and businesses to have working air con- ditioning. ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7681 Department Response: The Department appreciates the com- ment, but is not empowered to make such a change. Only the Texas Legislature could impose such a requirement. Comment: One commenter stated that GFCI protection makes installation of air conditioning equipment more costly, and should not be required if the equipment is installed correctly. Department Response: The Department appreciates the com- ment. ADVISORY BOARD RECOMMENDATIONS AND COMMIS- SION ACTION The Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Contractors Advisory Board met on August 24, 2022, to discuss the proposed rules and the public comments received. The Advisory Board rec- ommended that the Commission adopt the proposed rules as published in the Texas Register. At its meeting on October 18, 2022, the Commission adopted the proposed rules as recommended by the Advisory Board. STATUTORY AUTHORITY The adopted rule is adopted under Texas Occupations Code, Chapters 51 and 1302, which authorize the Texas Commission of Licensing and Regulation, the Department's governing body, to adopt rules as necessary to implement these chapters and any other law establishing a program regulated by the Department.

EXAMINING BOARDS PART 3. TEXAS BOARD OF CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS CHAPTER 72. BOARD FEES, LICENSE APPLICATIONS, AND RENEWALS 22 TAC \u00a772.3 The Texas Board of Chiropractic Examiners (Board) adopts amended 22 TAC \u00a772.3 (Qualifications) without changes as published in the September 9, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 5391). The organization of the accrediting entities for chiropractic schools recognized by the Board for licensing purposes has changed; the amendment updates that change. The rule will not be republished. The Board received no comments about the proposed amend- ment. The amended rule is adopted under Texas Occupations Code \u00a7201.152, which authorizes the Board to adopt rules necessary to perform the Board's duties and to regulate the practice of chi- ropractic, and Texas Occupations Code \u00a7\u00a7201.302 and 201.303, which authorizes the Board to recognize national chiropractic ac- creditation organizations. No other statutes or rules are affected by this amended rule. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the adop- tion and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal au- thority.

BUSINESS PRACTICES 22 TAC \u00a775.10 The Texas Board of Chiropractic Examiners (Board) adopts new 22 TAC \u00a775.10 (Chiropractic Health Requirements) with change as published in the September 9, 2022, issue of the Texas Reg- ister (47 TexReg 5393). The rule will be republished. This rule reiterates the current statutory requirements for chiropractors providing telehealth services found in Texas Occupations Code Chapter 111 (Telemedicine, Teledentistry, and Telehealth). The new rule also adds a requirement that licensed chiropractors pro- vide their patients with access to copies of their Board-issued li- cense and the Board-required mandatory notice to the public. A chiropractor is already required to provide access to those two documents (found in 22 TAC \u00a775.6 and \u00a775.7) to patients during live face-to-face visits; the proposed rule merely extends that re- quirement to telehealth visits. The Board received no comments about the rule. The new rule is adopted under Texas Occupations Code \u00a7201.152, which authorizes the Board to adopt rules necessary to perform the Board's duties and to regulate the practice of chiropractic, and Texas Occupations Code \u00a7111.007, which authorizes the Board to adopt rules pertaining to the standard of care for telehealth services. No other statutes or rules are affected by this new rule. \u00a775.10. Chiropractic Telehealth Requirements (a) A licensee may provide chiropractic telehealth services to patients in compliance with this rule. (b) Before providing chiropractic telehealth services, a li- censee shall obtain a patient's written informed consent. (c) A licensee shall use the same standard of care when pro- viding chiropractic telehealth services to a patient as the licensee would in an in-person setting.

STATE BOARD OF DENTAL EXAMINERS CHAPTER 101. DENTAL LICENSURE 22 TAC \u00a7101.2 The State Board of Dental Examiners (Board) adopts this amendment to 22 TAC \u00a7101.2, concerning licensure by ex- amination for dentists. The amendment updates the language to clarify that clinical examinations must use live patients or hands-on simulations. The amendment reflects the merger of the regional examining board CDCA-WREB-CITA, and the name change of the regional examining board SRTA. The amendment also changes the time period the Board will accept examination results.

The Texas Dental Association (TDA) provided a written com- ment in support of adoption of the rule as proposed. TDA states the rule is consistent with TDA policy supporting clinical den- tal licensure examination formats that are manikin-based, com- puter-based, or live-patient based. All examination formats must be psychometrically valid and reliable measurements of a den- tist licensure applicant's clinical skills in general dentistry. No changes to the proposed rule were made as a result of the com- ment. This rule is adopted under Texas Occupations Code \u00a7254.001(a), which gives the Board authority to adopt rules necessary to perform its duties and ensure compliance with state laws relating to the practice of dentistry to protect the public health and safety.

TEXAS STATE BOARD OF PLUMBING EXAMINERS CHAPTER 361. ADMINISTRATION SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS 22 TAC \u00a7361.1, \u00a7361.13 The Texas State Board of Plumbing Examiners (Board) adopts the amendments to 22 Texas Administrative Code \u00a7361.1, re- lating to Definitions, and \u00a7361.13, relating to Board Committees and Enforcement Committee. The amendments to \u00a7361.1 and \u00a7361.13 are adopted without changes to the proposed text pub- lished in the July 8, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3870). These rules will not be republished. REASONED JUSTIFICATION OF ADOPTED AMENDMENTS The Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 1301 (Plumbing License Law or PLL) was amended by House Bill 636 (HB 636), 87th Texas Legislature, Regular Session, 2021. The adopted rules implement statutory changes made by HB 636. The amendment to \u00a7361.1(16) amends the definition of Contin- uing Professional Education by removing a reference to \"Board\" approval and eliminating unnecessary language. HB 636 trans- ferred the responsibility of continuing education approval from the Board to the Executive Director. The amendment to \u00a7361.1(21)(E)(iv) amends the definition of Field Representative by eliminating the responsibly of a Field Representative to issue citations. HB 636 eliminated the author- ity of Field Representatives to issue citations.

LICENSING AND 365.8, 365.14, 365.15, 365.19 - 365.25 The Texas State Board of Plumbing Examiners (Board) adopts the amendments to 22 Texas Administrative Code \u00a7365.1, relating to License, Endorsement and Registration Categories; Scope of Work Permitted, \u00a7365.5, relating to Renewal of License, Registration or Endorsement, \u00a7365.7, relating to Duplicate Pocket Card, \u00a7365.8, relating to Change of Name, Address, or Employment, \u00a7365.14, relating to Course Year for Continuing Professional Education and Training Programs, \u00a7365.15, relating to Curriculum Minimum Standards, \u00a7365.19, relating to Course Providers of Continuing Professional Edu- cation Programs, \u00a7365.20, relating to Course Instructors for Continuing Professional Education Programs, \u00a7365.21, relating to Continuing Professional Education Programs for the Med- ical Gas Piping Installation Endorsement, \u00a7365.22, relating to Licensing Procedures for Military Spouses, \u00a7365.23, relating to Transfer of License, \u00a7365.24, relating to Continuing Education and Training Exemptions, and a new rule at \u00a7365.25, relating to Temporary License. The amendments to 365.8, 365.14, 365.15 and 365.19 - 365.24 are adopted without changes to the proposed text published in the July 8, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3870.) These rules will not be republished. The new rule at 22 Texas Administrative Code \u00a7365.25, relating to Temporary License is adopted with changes to the proposed text as published in the July 8, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3870) and will therefore be republished. REASONED JUSTIFICATION OF ADOPTED AMENDMENTS The Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 1301 (Plumbing License Law or PLL) was amended by House Bill 636 (HB 636), 87th Texas Legislature, Regular Session, 2021. The adopted rules implement statutory changes made by HB 636. The amendment to \u00a7365.1 eliminates unnecessary language and references to simplify the rule and make it easier to read. ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7685 The amendment to \u00a7365.5 rewords and restructures the require- ments for renewal in an effort to simplify it and make it easier to read. The amendment to \u00a7365.7 eliminates an unnecessary reference. The amendment to \u00a7365.8 consolidates subsection (d) into (a) to show a licensee or registrant must inform the Board of a change of physical address and legal name change. It also makes a new requirement that the Board be notified of a change in email address. The amendment to \u00a7365.14 changes the rule heading to \"Con- tinuing Professional Education and Training Requirements.\" It further adds \"as applicable\" to subsection (c) to clarify that con- tinuing education and training can be taken in person, via corre- spondence, or virtually. The amendment to \u00a7365.15 eliminates references to a \"pub- lisher\" of course material. The Board earlier repealed regulation of publishers. Further language is eliminated to streamline the rule and clarify the Executive Director will approve both continu- ing professional education and training courses. Lastly, a clarifi- cation in (c) shows that course material is approved for two years from their stated effective date, or the date they are approved, whichever is later. The amendment to \u00a7365.19 eliminates reference to Board ap- proval. Under HB 636, the Executive Director facilitates the administrative approval of courses and instructors. Overly pro- scriptive rules regarding class format, delivery, and class size are eliminated as was recommended by the Sunset Commis- sion. Courses and training segments are required to be at least one hour in length. Providers may incorporate materials or pre- sentations by manufacturing vendors but only educational and informative portions will be given credit. If a course is cancelled, the Provider shall offer to refund or reschedule the course. The provider will furnish a certificate of completion to the student within three business days of successful course completion. The amendment to \u00a7365.20 sets the minimum qualifications for instructors of continuing education courses and training programs, eliminates overly proscriptive language as recom- mended by the Sunset Commission and facilitates the standards under which the Executive Director will approve instructors as mandated by HB 636. An instructor must be a journeyman, master, or plumbing inspector in good standing. An instructor teaching an endorsement course, must hold that endorsement. Instructors must teach approved material and report course completion with 48 hours after the course ends. The amendment to \u00a7365.21 adds to the current rule that provides that continuing education for a medial gas piping endorsement must have two hours of CPE. The rule proposal amends the rule to include that the successful completion of a national certifica- tion in medical gas may also satisfy the continuing education re- quirement for that endorsement. Further changes eliminate the requirement for a bound, physical copy of NFPA 99, as the NFPA is available and used digitally. Further language is eliminated to remove unnecessary language and references. The amendment to \u00a7365.22 adopts rules providing for licens- ing military service members, military veterans, and military spouses. The amendment to \u00a7365.23 reflects the statutory authority to al- low for the transfer of a license held for 35 consecutive years. \u00a7365.23(a) is inconsistent with statute and is eliminated. The remaining changes simply eliminate unnecessary language and reference to improve readability. The amendment to \u00a7365.24 allows instructors who teach the al- ternative option for becoming a Tradesman-Limited Plumber at a high school or institute of higher education the ability to renew their license by completing six hours of continuing education at least every three years, if they provide at least 18 hours of in- struction annually. This provision facilitates the requirement in HB 636 which amended 1301.407(g). The new rule at \u00a7365.25 creates a rule to support the temporary, non-renewable, 30-day licenses provided in HB 636. This rule shows that this license may be granted in conditions of disaster as declared by the Governor or an event determined by the Ex- ecutive Director. COMMENTS No comments were received regarding the proposed rules. STATUTORY AUTHORITY The amendments are adopted under the authority of \u00a71301.251(2) of the Occupations Code, which requires the Board to adopt and enforce rules necessary to administer and enforce the Plumbing License Law. \u00a7365.25. Temporary License. (a) The agency may issue temporary licenses to qualified, out- of-state plumbing professionals to work in Texas if the Governor of Texas issues a disaster proclamation, or in an event determined by the Executive Director; (b) Temporary license holders may only engage in the activi- ties authorized by the license type during the disaster recovery period and only in the designated disaster area; and (c) An emergency license expires 30 days after issuance. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the adop- tion and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal au- thority.

List of interested groups or associations against the rule. None. Summary of comments against the rule. None. List of interested groups or associations for the rule. None. Summary of comments for the rule. None. Agency Response. None. Statutory Authority. The rule is adopted under Tex. Occ. Code, Title 3, Subtitle I, Chapter 507, which provides the Texas Behavioral Health Exec- utive Council with the authority to make all rules, not inconsistent with the Constitution and Laws of this State, which are reason- ably necessary for the proper performance of its duties and reg- ulations of proceedings before it. Additionally, the Executive Council adopts this rule pursuant to the authority found in \u00a7507.152 of the Tex. Occ. Code which vests the Executive Council with the authority to adopt rules nec- essary to perform its duties and implement Chapter 507 of the Tex. Occ. Code. In accordance with \u00a7505.2015 of the Tex. Occ. Code the Texas State Board of Social Worker Examiners previously voted and, by a majority, approved to propose the adoption of this rule to the Executive Council. The rule is specifically authorized by \u00a7505.2015 of the Tex. Occ. Code which states the Board shall propose to the Executive Council rules regarding the qualifica- tions necessary to obtain a license; the scope of practice, stan- dards of care, and ethical practice; continuing education require- ments for license holders; and a schedule of sanctions for viola- tions of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter. The Executive Council also adopts this rule in compliance with \u00a7507.153 of the Tex. Occ. Code. The Executive Council may not propose and adopt a rule regarding the qualifications nec- essary to obtain a license; the scope of practice, standards of care, and ethical practice for a profession; continuing education requirements; or a schedule of sanctions unless the rule has been proposed by the applicable board for the profession. In this instance, the underlying board has proposed the rule to the Executive Council. Therefore, the Executive Council has com- plied with Chapters 505 and 507 of the Texas Occupations Code and may adopt this rule. Lastly, the Executive Council adopts this rule under the author- ity found in \u00a72001.004 of the Tex. Gov't Code which requires state agencies to adopt rules of practice stating the nature and requirements of all available formal and informal procedures. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the adop- tion and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal au- thority.

APPLICATION AND LICENSING 22 TAC \u00a7781.401 The Texas Behavioral Health Executive Council adopts amend- ments to \u00a7781.401, relating to Qualifications for Licensure. Sec- tion 781.401 is adopted without changes to the proposed text as published in the August 5, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4616) and will not be republished. Reasoned Justification. The adopted amendment removes the requirements that super- vised experience must be obtained within five years immediately preceding the date of application for specialty recognition. List of interested groups or associations against the rule. None. Summary of comments against the rule. A commenter opined that the 3000 hours, and 100 supervision hours, over 24-48 months does not meet requirements consis- tent in other states. List of interested groups or associations for the rule. None. Summary of comments for the rule. A commenter voiced support for the deletion of the five year re- quirement, but then voiced concern that the opportunity created by this change is defeated by the requirement that the 100 super- vision hours must be with a Council approved supervisor. The commenter opined that this will not help applicants that previ- ously completed their 100 supervision hours with a Board ap- proved supervisor, since the Council was not formed until 2019, and asked that the Council approved supervisor part of this rule be deleted. Agency Response. The commenter's concerns regarding the 24-48 month require- ment in this rule were not part of the proposed rule amendments. This proposed change removed the requirement that supervised experience must be obtained within five years immediately pre- ceding the date of application for specialty recognition. There- fore, the Executive Counsel declines to make any requested changes to the 24-48 month requirement in this rule adoption because it would be beyond the scope of this rule proposal. Ad- ditionally, the Executive Council declines to delete the require- ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7687 ment that 100 supervision hours must be completed by a Council approved supervisor, because the Executive Council will accept previous supervised experience hours completed under a former Board approved supervisor. When H.B. 1501, 86th Leg., R.S. (2019), created the Executive Council it consolidated the author- ity to issue licenses, rules, and regulate the professions for the underlying Boards to the Executive Council. Therefore, when a license is issued or status change granted, such as supervisor status, it is now done so by the Executive Council with input from the member Boards, see 22 Texas Administrative Code \u00a7882.20. The supervisor status for social workers has not changed, only the government entity issuing the supervisor stats has, so if the required 100 supervision hours were completed under a previ- ous Board approved supervisor they will still qualify, just as if they are currently completed under a Council approved supervisor.

TEXAS STATE BOARD OF EXAMINERS OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPISTS CHAPTER 801. LICENSURE AND REGULATION OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPISTS SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS 22 TAC \u00a7801.2 The Texas Behavioral Health Executive Council adopts amended \u00a7801.2, relating to Definitions. Section 801.2 is adopted without changes to the proposed text as published in the August 5, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4624) and will not be republished. Reasoned Justification. The adopted amendment adds a definition for direct clinical ser- vices to couples or family for the purpose of providing greater clarity in the rules. List of interested groups or associations against the rule. None. Summary of comments against the rule. A commenter opposed this rule change because the commenter believed this rule change could result in applicants becoming licensed as an LMFT without working clinically with any, or few, intact families or couples. The commenter requested the rule be amended to place a limit or cap on the number of these hours that could be counted towards licensure. List of interested groups or associations for the rule. None. Summary of comments for the rule. A commenter voiced support for this rule, the commenter be- lieved that residential groups and treatment groups should be included as part of the definition of direct clinical services to cou- ples or family. The commenter believed that youths in detention who are in group counseling are treated as members of a sys- tem, which is much different than group counseling for members in the community. Therefore, the commenter supports the inclu- sion of these groups into the proposed definition for direct clinical services to couples or family. Agency Response. The Executive Council declines to make changes to the rule as requested. The services provided under this definition will always be systemic and the Texas State Board of Examiners of Marriage and Family Therapists did not want to limit these systemic hours as the commenter requested. Further, the Board felt placing numerical caps or limits on the types of systemic hours would create a more complicated licensing requirement than would be necessary to ensure public protection and that competent providers are licensed. The Executive Council agreed with the Board's recommendation not to amend this rule as requested by the commenter. The Executive Council thanks the commenter for the supportive comments. Statutory Authority. The rule is adopted under Tex. Occ. Code, Title 3, Subtitle I, Chapter 507, which provides the Texas Behavioral Health Exec- utive Council with the authority to make all rules, not inconsistent with the Constitution and Laws of this State, which are reason- ably necessary for the proper performance of its duties and reg- ulations of proceedings before it.

Severity Level and Sanction Guide. The following severity levels and sanction guides are based on the rel- evant factors in council rules, 22 Texas Administrative Code, \u00a7884.20 (relating to Disciplinary Guidelines and General Schedule of Sanc- tions). (1) Level One--Revocation of license. These violations ev- idence intentional or gross misconduct on the part of the licensee or cause or pose a high degree of harm to the public or may require severe punishment as a deterrent to the licensee, or other licensees. (2) Level Two--Suspension of license. These violations in- volve less misconduct, harm, or need for deterrence than Level One vi- olations, but may require suspension of licensure for a period of time. (3) Level Three--Probated suspension of license. These vi- olations do not involve enough harm, misconduct, or need for deter- rence to warrant suspension of licensure, yet are severe enough to war- rant monitoring of the licensee to ensure future compliance. Probation- ary terms may be ordered as appropriate. (4) Level Four--Reprimand. These violations involve in- advertent or relatively minor misconduct or rule violations not directly involving the health, safety and welfare of the public. (5) An administrative penalty may be assessed for any vi- olation, in lieu of, or in addition to, other disciplinary actions. A max- imum amount of $5,000 may be imposed for each violation, each day a violation continues or occurs is a separate violation for purposes of imposing a penalty.

The Executive Council may not propose and adopt a rule regarding the qual- ifications necessary to obtain a license; the scope of practice, standards of care, and ethical practice for a profession; contin- uing education requirements; or a schedule of sanctions unless the rule has been proposed by the applicable board for the pro- fession. In this instance, the underlying board has proposed the repeal of this rule to the Executive Council. Therefore, the Ex- ecutive Council has complied with Chapters 502 and 507 of the Texas Occupations Code and may adopt the repeal of this rule. Lastly, the Executive Council also adopts the repeal of this rule under the authority found in \u00a72001.004 of the Tex.

Section 801.305 is adopted without changes to the proposed text as published in the August 5, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4630) and will not be republished. Reasoned Justification. This new rule has been adopted to make the format of the sched- ule of sanctions easier to use and standardized between the other behavioral health boards. There are a few substantive changes being adopted to the schedule currently in effect. Rules that are currently split between an extended and moderate sus- pension are proposed to be a Level 2 suspension to align with the adopted changes to \u00a7801.302, which combines the two sus- pension levels into one, for example see \u00a7\u00a7801.44(t) and (v), 801.47, and 801.57(e). Additionally, a few typographical errors are being corrected with this adopted change, the sanction for 801.47 is now split into subsections (a) and (b) which are a sus- pension and revocation respectively. And \u00a7801.44(s) - (v) have been updated to correspond more accurately to the correct rule and sanction. Lastly, in the April 22, 2022, edition of the Texas Register, \u00a7801.143(h) - (l) were adopted to be amended so cor- responding amendments have been made to match those pre- viously proposed changes.

TEXAS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EXECUTIVE COUNCIL CHAPTER 885. FEES 22 TAC \u00a7885.1 The Texas Behavioral Health Executive Council adopts amend- ments to \u00a7885.1, relating to Executive Council Fees. Section 885.1 is adopted without changes to the proposed text as pub- lished in the August 5, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4632) and will not be republished. Reasoned Justification. On October 8, 2019, Governor Greg Abbott sent a letter to all Texas State agency heads instructing agencies to reform oc- cupational-licensing rules in several areas. One such area the Governor focused on was the reduction of fees, specifically the Governor instructed agencies to develop and implement plans to reduce license applications fees to 75% or less of the national av- erage for equivalent or comparable occupations, whenever pos- sible. This adopted amendment is intended to do just that, all ap- plication and renewal licensing fees have either been reduced to 75% of the national average or, if the fee was already below 75% of the national average, then the fee stayed the same. The cur- rent fee schedule will remain in effect until September 1, 2023, on this date these new fee changes are scheduled to take ef- fect. Application fees are adopted to be reduced for the follow- ing license types: LCSW by $9.00, LPC LP by $426.00, and LSSP by $36.00. Renewal fees are adopted to be reduced for the following license types: LBSW and LMSW by $33.00, LCSW and LP by $129.00. Additionally, the $4.00 Texas.gov fee is adopted to be removed from the temporary license appli- cation for social workers and the application for criminal history evaluation. The implementation of these fee changes is sched- uled to take effect on September 1, 2023, to provide all inter- ested parties the opportunity to comment on these changes, and based upon future comments and information gathered these fee changes may be subject to future amendments.

HEALTH SERVICES PART 1. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HEALTH SERVICES CHAPTER 139. ABORTION FACILITY REPORTING AND LICENSING The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) adopts amendments to \u00a7139.2, concerning Definitions; \u00a7139.4, concerning Monthly Reporting Requirements for All Abortions Performed or Induced; \u00a7139.5, concerning Additional Report- 47 TexReg 7696 November 18, Texas Register ing Requirements; \u00a7139.32, concerning License Denial, Sus- Probation, or concerning \u00a7139.53, concerning Medical and Clinical Services; and \u00a7139.55, concerning Clinical Records. The amendments to \u00a7\u00a7139.2, 139.4, 139.5, and 139.53 are adopted with changes to the proposed text as published in the May 6, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 2694). These rules will be republished. The amendments to \u00a7\u00a7139.32, 139.50, 139.52, and 139.55 are adopted without changes to the proposed text as published in the May 6, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 2694). These rules will not be republished. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION The amendments are necessary to comply with Senate Bill (S.B.) 8, 87th Legislature, 2021, Regular Session, and S.B. 4, 87th Legislature, 2021, Second Called Session. S.B. 8 requires physicians who perform an abortion on or after September 1, 2021, to maintain certain documentation regarding the rea- sons for an abortion and prohibits HHSC from enforcing Texas Health and Safety Code (HSC) Chapter 171, Subchapter H, concerning Detection of Fetal Heartbeat. S.B. 4 amends abor- tion complication reporting requirements and requirements for providing abortion-inducing drugs for abortions performed on or after December 2, 2021. The amendments are also necessary to remove outdated information and ensure consistency with current HHSC terminology. COMMENTS The 31-day comment period ended June 6, 2022. During this period, HHSC received comments regarding the proposed rules from three commenters, including Texas Medical Association (TMA), Parkland Health, and an individual commenter. A sum- mary of comments and HHSC's responses follow. Comment: TMA commented the public could interpret the proposed amendment to \u00a7139.2(1), which removes language from the abortion definition clarifying only a physician licensed in Texas may perform or induce an abortion, to permit individuals who are not licensed Texas physicians to perform or induce an abortion. TMA suggested amending \u00a7139.53 to add language clarifying only a physician licensed in Texas may perform or induce an abortion. Response: HHSC revised \u00a7139.53(b) by adding \u00a7139.53(b)(8) to clarify only a physician may perform a medical abortion. HHSC also added the word \"surgical\" to \u00a7139.53(a)(7) to in- crease clarity and consistency with \u00a7139.53(b)(8). Comment: TMA suggested amending the abortion-inducing drug definition under \u00a7139.2(4) to use the same language as HSC \u00a7171.061(2) because the proposed rule omits part of the statutory definition. TMA expressed their concern with omitting a portion of the statutory definition and stated doing so may lead the public to assume an abortion-inducing drug has a different meaning in Chapter 139 than under HSC \u00a7171.061(2). Response: HHSC revised \u00a7139.2(4) to align with Health stated the medical abortion def- inition under \u00a7139.2(35) differs from the definition in HSC \u00a7171.061(5) and that the difference may cause confusion regarding when using a particular medication constitutes a potentially prohibited medical abortion. Response: HHSC revised \u00a7139.2(35) to align with HSC \u00a7171.061(5). Comment: expressed concern with the proposed amend- ments to \u00a7139.4(c), which replace the list of 16 categories of in- formation required for monthly abortion reporting with language requiring the monthly report to include the information HHSC re- quires through the agency's secure electronic reporting system in accordance with HSC Chapters 171 and 245. TMA stated re- moving the list of specific information a facility must report may cause confusion among providers regarding what information they must report because HSC Chapters 171 and 245 contain multiple requirements. TMA suggested revising \u00a7139.4(c) to in- clude the list of specific reporting requirements. Response: HHSC revised \u00a7139.4(c) to include the list of the 16 categories of information required for monthly abortion reporting currently listed under \u00a7139.4(c) to increase clarity and added four additional categories regarding the required information facilities must report monthly and to increase consistency with S.B. 8's amendment to HSC \u00a7245.011. Comment: Parkland Health commented on \u00a7139.4(f), stating the language proposes a single method of filing required reports and urged HHSC to adopt a backup system allowing providers to report outside of the primary electronic reporting system so providers can comply with the reporting requirements when the electronic system is unavailable due to technical issues. Park- land Health suggested HHSC revise \u00a7139.4(f) to include the op- tion to submit reports by certified mail, as permitted under current rule, or by receipted courier. Response: HHSC declines to revise \u00a7139.4(f) in response to this comment because HSC \u00a7245.011(g) requires HHSC to es- tablish and maintain a secure electronic reporting system for the submission of reports. HHSC encourages providers to contact HHSC when they experience technical issues with the electronic reporting system. Comment: Parkland Health suggested amending \u00a7139.5(2)(C) to clarify when a provider must complete the Induced Abortion Report or the Medical Emergency Abortion Incident Report and to add a definition for emergency abortions. Response: A physician who performs or induces an abortion must always complete the Induced Abortion Report under \u00a7139.4. In addition to the Induced Abortion Report, a physician who performs or induces an emergency abortion under one of the three circumstances identified in 139.5(2) must also complete the Medical Emergency Abortion Incident Report. Accordingly, HHSC revised \u00a7139.5(2)(A) and (B) to clarify the three circumstances under which a Medical Emergency Abortion Incident Report is required. HHSC declines to revise the rule to add a definition for emergency abortion because \"medical emergency\" is already defined in the relevant statutes. Comment: TMA stated replacing the list of 11 categories of infor- mation required for reporting of abortion complications in \u00a7139.5 with a reference to the requirements listed HSC Chapters 171 and 245, may cause confusion among providers about what in- formation to report. TMA suggests that HHSC list the specific reporting requirements in the rule itself. Response: HHSC revised \u00a7139.5(3)(E) to list the 11 categories of information required for abortion complication reporting un- der current \u00a7139.5(3)(E) to increase clarity and align with HSC \u00a7171.006. ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7697 Comment: An individual expressed concern about \u00a7139.32(b) prohibiting HHSC from enforcing HSC Chapter 171, Subchap- ter H, and stated the language places Texas residents' health, safety, and wellbeing at risk because private civil entities do not have the capacity to oversee and ensure a licensed entity's reg- ulatory compliance. Response: HHSC declines to revise the rule in response to this comment because \u00a7139.32(b) aligns with HSC \u00a7171.005 and \u00a7171.207, which expressly prohibit HHSC from enforcing HSC Chapter 171, Subchapter H.

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PART 1. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES COMMISSION CHAPTER 553. LICENSING STANDARDS FOR ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES SUBCHAPTER A. INTRODUCTION 26 TAC \u00a7553.3 The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) adopts in Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Title 26, Part 1, Chapter 553, Licensing Standards for Assisted Living Facilities, amendments to \u00a7553.3, relating to Definitions; \u00a7553.17, relating to Criteria for Licensing; \u00a7553.103, relating to Site and Location for all Assisted Living Facilities; \u00a7553.257, relating to Human Resources; and \u00a7553.259, relating to Admission Policies and Procedures. The amendments to \u00a7\u00a7553.3, 553.17, 553.103, and 553.257 are adopted with changes to the proposed text as published in the August 5, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4633). These rules will be republished. The amendments to \u00a7553.259 are adopted without changes to the proposed text as published in the August 5, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4633). These rules will not be republished. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION The purpose of the amendments to \u00a7553.17 and \u00a7553.103 is to implement House Bill Legislature, Regu- lar of as- sisted living facilities (ALFs) in a 100-year flood plain in counties of more than 3.3 million residents. The amendments also update outdated procedural information related to the licensing process. The purpose of the amendments to \u00a7553.257 is to implement Senate Bill (S.B.) 271, 87th Legislature, Regular Session, 2021. S.B. 271 requires ALFs to obtain a signed disclosure, on an HHSC prescribed form, from applicants for employment regarding out-of-state criminal convictions and to perform a name-based criminal history check in any state the applicant has lived in during the previous five years. The purpose of the amendments to \u00a7553.3 and \u00a7553.259 is to implement S.B. 383, 87th Legislature, Regular Session, 2021. S.B. 383 requires an ALF that advertises, markets, or otherwise promotes that it provides memory care services to provide an additional HHSC-prescribed memory care disclosure statement to each resident. The amendments also update rule references that became out- dated as a result of the administrative transfer of rules from 40 TAC Chapter 92 to 26 TAC Chapter 553, reflect the transfer of functions from the Texas Department of Human Services or the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services to HHSC, up- date terminology, and remove outdated references and require- ments. COMMENTS The 31-day comment period ended September 6, 2022. During this period, HHSC received comments regarding the pro- posed rules from three commenters: Texas Assisted Living As- sociation, Office of the State Long-term Care Ombudsman, and Texas Healthcare Association. A summary of comments relating to the rules and HHSC's responses follows. Comment: A commenter suggested moving the date of imple- mentation for the requirement prohibiting a newly constructed ALF from being built in a 100-year flood plain if the facility is located in a county of more than 3.3 million residents. The com- menter also recommended that HHSC accept Federal Emer- gency Management Agency (FEMA) documentation in addition to the FEMA flood maps. The proposed rules at \u00a7553.103 im- plemented this rule beginning November 1, 2022. This date was chosen to coincide with the effective date of the rule. The com- menter suggested changing the date to January 1, 2023, and to have the date apply to the submission of construction documents for architectural review by HHSC. Response: HHSC declined to make the requested change to the rule implementation date but did change the date to match the rule effective date. HHSC will provide clarifying policy guid- ance about when the requirement will begin being enforced after the rule becomes effective. HHSC will also include in the policy guidance that FEMA documentation will be accepted by HHSC in addition to the FEMA flood maps. Comment: A commenter recommended adding language to \u00a7553.257 to clarify that an employee may be hired by a facility pending the out of state background checks but must not hold a position that has direct contact with residents until the background checks have cleared. Response: HHSC agreed with the commenter and revised the rule as suggested. Comment: Multiple commenters expressed concern over an additional memory care disclosure statement required by \u00a7553.259. Commenters stated that multiple disclosure state- ments may be confusing to prospective or new residents. One commenter stated that the definition of \"Memory care services\" at \u00a7553.3(52) may confuse people by using the term \"memory care impairment.\" Response: HHSC declined to remove the additional memory care disclosure statement from rule as it is required by S.B. 383. HHSC agreed with the commenter regarding the defini- tion of \"Memory care services\" and made clarifying changes in \u00a7553.3(52). HHSC made a change to \u00a7553.3(10) to clarify the definition of the \"Assisted Living Facility Memory Care Disclosure Statement.\" ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7705 HHSC edited the date in \u00a7553.17 and \u00a7553.103 to December 6, 2022. This date will coincide with the effective date of the rule. HHSC made a change to \u00a7553.257(b)(4) to reflect the new TAC reference for the employee misconduct registry.

NURSING FACILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR LICENSURE AND MEDICAID CERTIFICATION 47 TexReg 7712 November 18, 2022 Texas Register The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) adopts in Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Title 26, Part 1, Chapter 554, Licensing Standards for Licensure and Medicaid Certification, amendments to \u00a7554.101, relating to Definitions; \u00a7554.204, relating to Application Requirements; \u00a7554.403, relating to Notice of Rights and Services; \u00a7554.1921, relating to General Requirements for a Nursing Facility; \u00a7554.1935, relat- ing to Automated External Defibrillators; \u00a7554.2002, relating to Procedural Requirements--Licensure Inspections and Surveys; \u00a7554.2326, relating to Medicaid Swing Bed Program for Rural Hospitals; and the repeal of \u00a7554.1913, relating to Clinical Records Service Supervisor. The amendments to \u00a7\u00a7554.101, 554.403, 554.1921 and \u00a7554.2326 are adopted with changes to the proposed text as published in the August 5, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4645). These rules will be republished. The amendments to \u00a7\u00a7554.204, 554.1935, and 554.2002, and the repeal of \u00a7554.1913 are adopted without changes to the pro- posed text as published in the August 5, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4645). These rules will not be republished. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION The purpose of the amendments to \u00a7\u00a7554.101, 554.204, 554.403, and 554.1921 is to implement Senate Bill (S.B.) 383, 87th Legislature, Regular Session, 2021. S.B. 383 requires a nursing facility (NF) that advertises, markets, or otherwise promotes that it provides memory care services to provide an additional HHSC prescribed memory care disclosure statement to each resident or resident representative and to each person applying for services from the facility or that person's next of kin or guardian. The purpose of the repeal of \u00a7554.1913 and amendments to \u00a7554.2326 is to remove the requirement for a NF to employ a clinical records supervisor or other medical records keeper. The purpose of the amendments to \u00a7554.1935 is to implement S.B. 199, 87th Legislature, Regular Session, 2021. S.B. 199 requires a NF to conduct monthly inspections of its automated external defibrillator. The purpose of the amendment to \u00a7554.2002 is to implement House Bill (H.B.) 1423, 87th Legislature, Regular Session, 2021. H.B. 1423 increases the survey frequency of required unannounced NF inspections from two per three-year licensing period to one annually. H.B. 1423 also allows HHSC to conduct a follow-up inspection for evaluation and monitoring purposes to ensure HHSC is citing deficiencies consistently. The amendments also update rule references that became out- dated as a result of the administrative transfer of rules from 40 TAC Chapter 19 to 26 TAC Chapter 554, reflect the transfer of functions from the Texas Department of Human Services or the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services to HHSC, up- date terminology, and remove outdated references and require- ments. COMMENTS The 31-day comment period ended September 6, 2022. During this period, HHSC received comments regarding the proposed rules from two commenters: the Office of the State Long-term Care Ombudsman and Texas Healthcare Associa- tion. A summary of comments relating to the rules and HHSC's responses follows. Comment: The commenters expressed concern over an additional memory care disclosure statement required by \u00a7554.403(n)(1). Commenters stated that multiple disclosure statements may be confusing to prospective or new residents. One commenter was concerned that memory care services may not be clearly distinguished from an Alzheimer's certified facility's services and recommended changes to language at \u00a7554.403(n)(1)(B). Another commenter recommended allowing more time to notify the residents of a change to the disclosure statement as required by \u00a7554.403(o). Response: HHSC declined to remove the additional memory care disclosure statement in \u00a7554.403(n)(1) as it is required by S.B. 383. HHSC agreed with the concerns that memory care services may not be clearly distinguished from Alzheimer's and revised the definition of \"Memory care services\" at \u00a7554.101(82) and revised language at \u00a7554.403(n)(1)(B). HHSC declined to increase the time frame in \u00a7554.403(o) to allow for more than 30-days' notice to residents and families before a change to the disclosure statement. HHSC will take this recommendation into consideration during a future rule project. HHSC made a change to \u00a7554.1921(e)(12) to comply with changes to Government Code \u00a7411.204 and remove the word \"concealed\" when referencing handguns. HHSC made a change to \u00a7554.2326(e) to remove the swing bed NF applicability reference requirements as they are informational only and are found in the requirements for hospitals. There is no additional benefit to having the rule references in the NF rules. SUBCHAPTER B.

Medicaid Swing Bed Program for Rural Hospitals. (a) Program description. HHSC operates the Medicaid Swing Bed Program for rural hospitals located in counties with populations of 100,000 or less. The Medicaid Swing Bed Program is modeled on Medicare's Swing Bed Program. The Medicaid Swing Bed Program permits participating rural hospitals to use their beds interchangeably to furnish both acute hospital care and nursing facility care to Medicaid recipients, when no care beds are available in nursing facilities (NFs) in the area. When a participating rural hospital furnishes NF nursing care to Medicaid recipients, HHSC makes payment to the hospital using the same procedures and the same Resource Utilization Group daily rates that the Texas Health and Human Services Commission authorizes for reimbursing NFs participating in the Texas Medicaid Nursing Home Program. (b) Application to participate. Rural hospitals apply to HHSC to participate in the Medicaid Swing Bed Program. Each applicant must be located in a county with a population of 100,000 or less and must meet the qualifying requirements of the Medicare Swing Bed Program. Hospitals approved for participation enter into swing bed provider agreements with HHSC. (c) Parallel participation in Medicare. A rural hospital partic- ipating in the Medicaid Swing Bed Program must: (1) have a Medicare hospital provider agreement; and (2) be Medicare-certified as a swing bed hospital in the Medicare Swing Bed Program. (d) Applicability of Medicare requirements. Each participat- ing rural hospital must satisfy all the requirements of the Medicare Swing Bed Program, except that Medicare's five-weekday transfer re- quirement and 15 percent payment limitation, as stated in 42 CFR \u00a7413.114(d)(2), do not apply for Medicaid reimbursement purposes. (e) Applicability of NF requirements. From day one of the res- ident's stay, a rural hospital participating in the Medicaid Swing Bed Program must meet the requirements set forth in \u00a7554.2304(c) of this chapter (relating to Contract Requirements); \u00a7\u00a7554.2601 - 554.2608 and 554.2610 of this chapter (relating to Vendor Payment (Items and Services Included), Additional Charges (Items and Services Excluded from Vendor Payment), Therapeutic Home Visits Away from the Facil- ity, Vendor Payment Information, Effective Date of Vendor Coverage, Supplementation of Vendor Payments, Penalties for Supplementation, Limitations on Provider Charges, and Medicare part A Skilled Nursing Facility Deductible and Coinsurance Payment); and Subchapter Y of this chapter (relating to Medical Necessity Determinations). (f) Rural hospital (Medicaid swing bed facility) licensure and certification requirements. Pursuant to Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7222.024 concerning the duplication of health care inspections and li- censing, a rural hospital participating in the Medicaid Swing Bed Pro- gram satisfies licensure and certification requirements referenced in this section when it is currently licensed and certified as a hospital. However, in accordance with Texas Human Resources Code, \u00a732.024, if the rural hospital's swing beds are used for more than one 30-day length of stay per year, per resident the hospital must comply with the full Nursing Facility Requirements. (g) Rural hospital (Medicaid swing bed facility) administra- tor. The governing body of a rural hospital participating in the Med- icaid Swing Bed Program satisfies the requirement to appoint a quali- fied full-time nursing facility administrator, found at \u00a7554.1902(b) of this chapter (relating to Governing Body), when it appoints a hospital administrator as its official representative and designates the adminis- trator's responsibilities and authority, subject to the following excep- tion. If the swing beds are used for more than one 30-day length of stay per year, per resident, the hospital's governing body must appoint a full-time licensed nursing facility administrator. (h) Rural hospital (Medicaid swing bed facility) staff devel- opment requirements. A rural hospital participating in the Medicaid Swing Bed Program satisfies the staff development requirements found at \u00a7554.1929 of this chapter (relating to Staff Development) if the swing beds are used for no more than one 30-day length of stay per year, per resident. 47 TexReg 7724 November 18, 2022 Texas Register (i) Rural hospital (Medicaid swing bed facility) transfer agree- ment. A rural hospital participating in the Medicaid Swing Bed Pro- gram is not required to have a transfer agreement with another hospital, as required by \u00a7554.1915 of this chapter (relating to Transfer Agree- ment). (j) Rural hospital geographic region. The phrase \"a participat- ing rural hospital's geographic region\" refers to an area that includes nursing facilities with which the hospital normally arranges transfers and all other nursing facilities in similar proximity to the hospital. If a hospital has no previous transfer practices on which to base a determi- nation, the phrase \"geographic region\" refers to an area that includes all nursing facilities within 50 miles of the hospital except for facilities that the hospital demonstrates to be inaccessible to its patients. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the adop- tion and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal au- thority.

LICENSING The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) adopts amendments to \u00a7\u00a7745.273, 745.275, 745.277, and 745.435 in Title 26, Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 745, Licensing. Amendments to \u00a7745.435 are adopted with changes to the pro- posed text as published in the July 22, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4254). This rule will be republished. Amendments to \u00a7\u00a7745.273, 745.275, and 745.277 are adopted without changes to the proposed text, as published in the July 22, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4254). These rules will not be republished. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION The amendments are necessary to implement sections of statute that were amended by Senate Bill (S.B.) 225, 87th Texas Legis- lature, Regular Session, 2021. S.B. 225, SECTIONS 5 and 9, amended Texas Human Re- sources Code (HRC) \u00a742.048(e) and \u00a742.048(e-3) to (1) delete the requirement that a license or certificate is automatically revoked when certain operations change location (although HRC \u00a742.048 only explicitly applies to licensed operations, this provision also applies to certified operations by way of HRC \u00a742.052(b)); (2) require the operation to inform HHSC Child Care Regulation (CCR) of the new location before moving there; and (3) allow the operation to operate at the new location after CCR approves the location as meeting all relevant require- ments. These changes to HRC \u00a742.048 took effect on September 1, 2021, and apply to the following operation types that may now change location without their license or certification being automatically revoked: (1) school-age programs, regardless of when they operate; (2) before or after-school programs; (3) licensed child-care homes; (4) child-care centers; and (5) general residential operations (GROs). Child-placing agencies (CPAs) were already able to change location without these statutory changes. However, the bill repealed the subsection that explicitly addressed CPAs, so CCR is aligning requirements for CPAs with those for other licensed or certified operation types for consistency. The amendments are also necessary to implement sections of statute added by S.B. 781, 86th Texas Legislature, Regular Ses- sion, 2019. This bill added HRC Chapter 42, Subchapter H, which includes requirements for GROs that provide treatment services to children with emotional disorders. CCR is clarifying in rule that if such an operation fails to comply with any applica- ble public notice and hearing requirements, CCR may deny the operation an amendment to provide treatment services to chil- dren with emotional disorders. CCR conducted two work group meetings: one on November 15, 2021, which included 32 invited participants with day care experience, and one on November 18, 2021, which included 12 invited participants with residential care experience. The work- groups met to discuss rule changes needed to implement the legislation and provided feedback on the drafted rules. COMMENTS The 31-day formal comment period ended August 22, 2022. Dur- ing this period, HHSC received five comments regarding the pro- posed rules from four commenters, which included the Texas Al- liance of Child and Family Services, a licensed child-care center; one set of parents; and one member of the public. A summary of comments relating to the rules and HHSC CCR's responses follows. Comment: Regarding the proposed rules in general, one com- menter simply stated that SECTIONS 5 and 9 of S.B. 225 are very important and need to be implemented. Response: HHSC appreciates the support for the rules. Comment: Regarding the proposed rules in general, one com- menter expressed appreciation for HHSC's work in implementing legislation and carrying out federal guidance. Response: HHSC appreciates the support for the rules. Comment: Regarding \u00a7745.273, one commenter asked for clar- ification regarding an operation moving to a location \"in a differ- ent community,\" as that language may be interpreted in multi- ple ways. The same commenter also recommended that HHSC consider whether the rule changes are in keeping with the statu- tory language in HRC \u00a742.0461, which refers to the issuance of a license or expansion of capacity, and HRC \u00a742.255, which al- lows county commissioners to request a hearing if needed at the time of an operation's license renewal. Response: HHSC disagrees with the commenter's a different community.\" Section 745.275 pro- vides context for when a GRO would need to meet public hear- ing requirements related to a change in location within a county with a population of less than 300,000. Through its repeated reference to \"the governing body of a community,\" \u00a7745.275 im- plicitly conveys that the GRO would have to meet public hearing requirements related to the new location if the new location is in a part of the county served by a governing body that does not serve the prior location. An obvious example is when the GRO ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7725 relocates to a different city or town within the county; other ex- amples include a different hospital district, housing authority, or special district. The bottom line is that HRC \u00a742.0461 recog- nizes that a GRO located in a county with a population of under 300,000 could have a significant effect on the law enforcement, school district, and community resources of that county, and that persons have the right to weigh in on how the presence of a GRO may affect those resources. Allowing the GRO to change location to a part of the county with different resources without requiring the GRO to meet the public hearing requirement in re- lation to the new location would circumvent the purpose of the public hearing requirement. Accordingly, HHSC also disagrees with the commenter's implication that the rule changes are not in line with statutory language for when a public hearing is re- quired. Regarding the commenter's mentioning of HRC \u00a742.255, HHSC adopted \u00a7745.487 (relating to When is a public hearing required for the renewal of license?) in April 2021 to implement the statute and allow HHSC to hold a public hearing regarding the renewal of the license of a GRO that provides treatment ser- vices to children with emotional disorders, if requested by the commissioner's court in the county in which the operation is lo- cated. Lastly, if HHSC decides at some point to develop more specific criteria for what constitutes a \"community,\" HHSC would seek input from providers, stakeholders, and the public during the rulemaking process. Comment: Regarding \u00a7745.435, one commenter expressed support for the changes, which allow certain child-care oper- ations to relocate without their licenses or certificates being automatically revoked. Response: HHSC appreciates the support for the rule. Comment: Regarding \u00a7745.435, one commenter expressed support for the changes, but recommended that language be added to ensure an operation's permit number does not change due to relocation. Response: HHSC appreciates the support for the rule. HHSC agrees with the commenter's recommendation and revised the rule to include language indicating that an operation's amended permit will retain the same \"permit number\" that is on the original permit.

MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR GENERAL RESIDENTIAL OPERATIONS The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) adopts amendments to \u00a7748.153 and \u00a7748.303 in Title 26, Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 748, Minimum Standards for Gen- eral Residential Operations. Amendments to \u00a7748.153 and \u00a7748.303 are adopted without changes to the proposed text, as published in the July 22, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4257). These rules will not be republished. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION The amendments are necessary to implement sections of statute that were amended by Senate Bill (S.B.) 225 and S.B. 863, 87th Texas Legislature, Regular Session, 2021. S.B. 225, SECTIONS 5 and 9, amended Texas Human Re- sources Code (HRC) \u00a742.048(e) and \u00a742.048(e-3) to (1) delete the requirement that a license or certificate is automatically revoked when certain operations change location (although HRC \u00a742.048 only explicitly applies to licensed operations, this provision also applies to certified operations by way of HRC \u00a742.052(b)); (2) require the operation to inform HHSC Child Care Regulation (CCR) of the new location before moving there; and (3) allow the operation to operate at the new location after CCR approves the location as meeting all relevant require- ments. These changes to HRC \u00a742.048 took effect on September 1, 2021, and apply to the following operation types that may now change location without their license or certification being auto- matically revoked: (1) school-age programs, regardless of when they (2) before or after-school programs; (3) licensed child-care centers; and 5) general residen- tial operations (GROs). S.B. 863 took effect on May 15, 2021. This bill amended HRC \u00a742.048 by adding subsection (e-4), which allows CCR to com- ply with a local or state order during a declared disaster (as de- scribed in Texas Government Code Chapter 418) by authorizing a licensed or certified residential child-care facility to temporarily (1) move to a new location not on the facility's license applica- tion; or (2) provide care for one or more children at an additional location that is not stated in the facility's license application. CCR conducted two work group meetings: one on November 15, 2021, which included 32 invited participants with day care experience, and one on November 18, 2021, which included 12 invited participants with residential care experience. The work- groups met to discuss rule changes needed to implement the legislation and provided feedback on the drafted rules. COMMENTS The 31-day formal comment period ended August 22, 2022. During this period, HHSC received three comments regarding the proposed rules from two commenters: the Texas Alliance of Child and Family Services, a licensed child-care center, and one member of the public. A summary of comments relating to the rules and HHSC CCR's responses follows. Comment: Regarding the proposed rules in general, one com- menter simply stated that SECTIONS 5 and 9 of S.B. 225 are very important and need to be implemented. Response: HHSC appreciates the support for the rules. Comment: Regarding the proposed rules in general, one com- menter expressed appreciation for HHSC's work in implementing legislation and carrying out federal guidance. Response: HHSC appreciates the support for the rules. Comment: Regarding \u00a7748.303, one commenter recommended that HHSC more comprehensively review the list of reporting re- quirements for serious incidents to determine if all the incidents truly need to be reported as soon as they are currently required to be. The commenter mentioned that there are 20 different cat- egories listing various type of incidents that allow for 38 possi- ble deficiencies with the standard's subsections being weighted from medium-high to high. The commenter expressed concern for the \"day-to-day compliance load for the regulated commu- nity.\" In addition, with regard to reporting as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after relocating or providing care at a location not noted on the operation's permit, the commenter rec- ommended the reporting time frame be more lenient and that it begin \"after the safety of the children...has been assured and the situation has stabilized such that the operation can reasonably be expected to have awareness of the relocation or additional child and the ability to make the report.\" Response: HHSC disagrees with the commenter's recommen- dations to revise the rule. HHSC recently evaluated the content and time frames for \u00a7748.303, during the comprehensive review of Chapter 748, and adopted rule changes resulting from that re- view took effect in April 2022. The reporting requirements and time frames that HHSC is currently adding to that rule implement HRC \u00a742.048(e-4), which provides that CCR may authorize a residential child-care operation to temporarily relocate or care for any child at a different location so the operation can comply with a declared state of disaster. The time frame stated in the rules for reporting these serious incidents is \"as soon as possi- ble, but no later than 24 hours\" after the occurrence of the rele- vant incident. This time frame for notifying CCR and parents is necessary to ensure that parents know the whereabouts of their children during a disaster. Further, this time frame is easily mea- surable when the date of relocation or provision of care at an alternate location is known. By comparison, the time frame and revisions suggested by the commenter would not provide clarity as to when the operation would have to make a report to CCR and parents; this lack of clarity could delay notifications to CCR and parents and result in inconsistent regulation.

MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR CHILD-PLACING AGENCIES The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) adopts amendments to \u00a7\u00a7749.153, 749.503, and 749.2551 in Ti-tle 26, Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 749, Minimum Stan- dards for Child-Placing Agencies. Amendments to \u00a7749.2551 and \u00a7749.503 are adopted with changes to the proposed text as published in the July 22, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4259). These rules will be republished. Amendments to \u00a7749.153 are adopted without changes to the proposed text, as published in the July 22, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4259). This rule will not be repub- lished. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION The amendments are necessary to implement sections of statute that were amended by Senate Bill (S.B.) 225 and S.B. 863, 87th Texas Legislature, Regular Session, 2021. S.B. 225, SECTIONS 5 and 9, amended Texas Human Re- sources Code (HRC) \u00a742.048(e) and \u00a742.048(e-3) to (1) delete the requirement that a license or certificate is automatically revoked when certain operations change location (although HRC \u00a742.048 only explicitly applies to licensed operations, this provision also applies to certified operations by way of HRC \u00a742.052(b)); (2) require the operation to inform HHSC Child Care Regulation (CCR) of the new location before moving there; and (3) allow the operation to operate at the new location after CCR approves the location as meeting all relevant require- ments. These changes to HRC \u00a742.048 took effect on September 1, 2021, and apply to the following operation types that may now change location without their license or certification being automatically revoked: (1) school-age programs, regardless of when they operate; (2) before or programs; (3) li- censed child-care homes; (4) child-care centers; and (5) general residential operations (GROs). Child-placing agencies (CPAs) were already able to change location without to these statutory changes made. However, the bill repealed the subsection that explicitly addressed CPAs, so CCR is aligning requirements for CPAs with those for other licensed or certified operation types for consistency. S.B. 863 amended HRC \u00a742.048 by adding subsection (e-4), which allows CCR to comply with a local or state order during a declared disaster (as described in Texas Government Code Chapter 418) by authorizing a licensed or certified residential child-care facility to temporarily (1) move to a new location not on the facility's license application; or (2) provide care for one or more children at an additional location that is not stated in the facility's license application. HRC \u00a742.048(e-4) took effect on May 15, 2021, and applies to GROs and CPAs. The amendments in Chapter 749 address temporary relocation of children in foster homes to be consis- tent with the bill's requirements for CPAs, which are tasked with overseeing foster homes. The amendments are also necessary to align foster home ca- pacity requirements related to 42 United States Code (U.S.C.) \u00a7671(a), which includes requirements that a state must meet to have a federally approved IV-E plan. CCR conducted two work group meetings: one on November 15, 2021, which included 32 invited participants with day care experience, and one on November 18, 2021, which included 12 invited participants with residential care experience. The work- 47 TexReg 7728 November 18, 2022 Texas Register groups met to discuss rule changes needed to implement the legislation and provided feedback on the drafted rules. COMMENTS The 31-day formal comment period ended August 22, 2022. Dur- ing this period, HHSC received four comments regarding the pro- posed rules from two commenters: the Texas Alliance of Child and Family Services, a licensed child-care center, and one mem- ber of the public. A summary of comments relating to the rules and HHSC CCR's responses follows. Comment: Regarding the proposed rules in general, one com- menter simply stated that SECTIONS 5 and 9 of S.B. 225 are very important and need to be implemented. Response: HHSC appreciates the support for the rules. Comment: Regarding the proposed rules in general, one com- menter expressed appreciation for HHSC's work in implementing legislation and carrying out federal guidance. Response: HHSC appreciates the support for the rules. Comment: Regarding \u00a7749.503, one commenter recommended that HHSC more comprehensively review the list of reporting re- quirements for serious incidents to determine if all the incidents truly need to be reported as soon as they are currently required to be. The commenter mentioned that there are 20 different cat- egories listing various type of incidents that allow for 38 possible deficiencies with the standard's subsections being weighted from medium-high to high. The commenter expressed concern for the \"day-to-day compliance load for the regulated community.\" In ad- dition, with regard to reporting as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after relocating the CPA office or foster home or providing care at a location not noted on the foster home's veri- fication, the commenter recommended the reporting time frame be more lenient and that it begin \"after the safety of the chil- dren...has been assured and the situation has stabilized such that the operation can reasonably be expected to have aware- ness of the relocation or additional child and the ability to make the report.\" Response: HHSC disagrees with the commenter's recommen- dations to revise the rule. HHSC recently evaluated the content and time frames for \u00a7749.503, during the comprehensive review of Chapter 749, and adopted rule changes resulting from that re- view took effect in April 2022. The reporting requirements and time frames that HHSC is currently adding to that rule implement HRC \u00a742.048(e-4), which provides that CCR may authorize a residential child-care operation to temporarily relocate or care for any child at a different location so the operation can comply with a declared state of disaster. The time frame stated in the rules for reporting these serious incidents is \"as soon as possi- ble, but no later than 24 hours\" after the occurrence of the rele- vant incident. This time frame for notifying CCR and parents is necessary to ensure that parents know the whereabouts of their children during a disaster. Further, this time frame is easily mea- surable when the date of relocation or provision of care at an alternate location is known. By comparison, the time frame and revisions suggested by the commenter would not provide clarity as to when the operation would have to make a report to CCR and parents; this lack of clarity could delay notifications to CCR and parents and result in inconsistent regulation. Comment: Regarding \u00a7749.2551, one commenter recom- mended that HHSC not delete subsection (d) as proposed because the subsection allows a CPA to ask for a capacity ex- ception for a foster home to care for seven or eight children. The commenter also recommended that HHSC consider including the additional exceptions permitted by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7672(c)(1)(B), particularly those allowing a parenting youth in care to remain with the parent's child and a family with special training or skills to provide care to a child with a severe disability. Response: HHSC partially agrees with the commenter's recom- mendation to reconsider the deletion of subsection (d). Instead of deleting the entire subsection, HHSC will retain the first sen- tence of subsection (d) in the revised rule with a slight modifica- tion to correct the TAC title reference. The second sentence of subsection (d) will remain deleted because the language is su- perfluous and not integral to meeting the intent of the subsection. In addition, HHSC agrees with the commenter's recommenda- tion to include all exceptions allowed by federal law and revised subsection (b) to allow a parenting youth in care to remain with the child of the parenting youth and to allow a family with special training or skills to provide care to a child with a severe disabil- ity. To ensure that HHSC only grants variances that are con- sistent with additional exceptions permitted by state and federal law, including federal law related to Title IV-E funding require- ments, HHSC is adding language to subsection (d) highlighting that HHSC will consider any limitations in state or federal law. A separate rule project may also include a cross reference to this subsection in Chapter 745, Subchapter J (Waivers and Vari- ances for Minimum Standards), to further ensure that Texas will meet Title IV-E funding requirements. HHSC made a change to correct a reference in paragraph (9) in Figure: 26 TAC \u00a7749.503(e). SUBCHAPTER C. ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION DIVISION 2.

CAPACITY AND CHILD/CARE- GIVER RATIO 26 TAC \u00a7749.2551 STATUTORY AUTHORITY The amendments are authorized by Texas Government Code \u00a7531.0055, which provides that the Executive Commissioner of HHSC shall adopt rules for the GRO and provision of services by the health and human services agencies, and Texas Govern- ment Code \u00a7531.02011, which transferred the regulatory func- tions of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to HHSC. In addition, HRC \u00a742.042(a) requires HHSC to adopt rules to carry out the requirements of HRC Chapter 42. \u00a7749.2551. What is the maximum number of children a foster family home may care for? (a) A one-parent foster family home with one additional full- time, live-in caregiver or a two-parent foster family home may care for up to six children, except as noted in the chart below: Figure: 26 TAC \u00a7749.2551(a) (b) A one-parent foster family home with one additional full- time, live-in caregiver or a two-parent foster family home may care for seven or eight children if all of the following criteria are met: (1) Each foster or adoptive child that you place in the home that expands the home's capacity to more than six children is placed in the home for the purpose of allowing: (A) Siblings to remain together; (B) A child with an established meaningful relationship with the foster family (including a relative or close family friend) to remain with the family; (C) A parenting youth in care to remain with the child of the parenting youth; or (D) A family with special training or skills to provide care to a child who has a severe disability; (2) The foster family home cares for a maximum of two infants and two more children less than six years old, unless the place- ment is necessary to maintain a sibling group of children; (3) The foster family home cares for a maximum of three children with primary medical needs requiring total care, unless the placement is necessary to maintain a sibling group of children; (4) You complete a Foster Family Home Capacity Excep- tion Form with the appropriate signatures and place the form in the foster family home record; and (5) After you complete the exception form, you lower the home's capacity each time a child listed on the form leaves the home until the home's capacity does not exceed six. This applies to both a 47 TexReg 7730 November 18, 2022 Texas Register foster child that leaves and a child who was placed in the home to be adopted leaves without the adoption being consummated. (c) A one-parent foster family home or two-parent foster fam- ily home with one foster parent absent for extended periods of time (such as military service or out-of-town job assignments) may care for up to six children, except as noted in the chart below: Figure: 26 TAC \u00a7749.2551(c) (d) Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this sec- tion, a child-placing agency may request an exception for a foster fam- ily home to care for seven or eight children by using the process for requesting a variance that is in 26 TAC Chapter 745, Subchapter J of this title (relating to Waivers and Variances for Minimum Standards) and meeting the requirements of that subchapter. When processing a request for a variance related to a foster home's capacity, we will con- sider any limitations in state or federal law. (e) The maximum number of children that a foster family home may care for includes any biological and adopted children of the caregivers who live in the foster home, any children receiving foster or respite child-care, and any children for whom the family provides day care.

RESEARCH INVOLVING HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES COMMISSION SERVICES 26 TAC \u00a7\u00a7925.1 - 925.11 The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) adopts in Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Title 1, Part 1, new Chapter 925, concerning Research Involving Health and Human Services Commission Services, consisting of \u00a7925.1, concern- Institutional Review Board; \u00a7925.6, con- cerning Designated Institutional Review Board Functions and Operations; \u00a7925.7, concerning Review and Approval of Pro- posed Research; \u00a7925.8, concerning Informed Consent; \u00a7925.9, concerning Using and Disclosing Protected Health Information in Research; \u00a7925.10, concerning Investigation of Allegations of Misconduct in Science; and \u00a7925.11, concerning Responsibili- ties of the Institutional Review Board 2. Sections 925.3, 925.6, 925.7, and 925.8 are adopted with changes to the proposed text as published in the July 8, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3917). These 925.9, 925.10, and 925.11 are adopted without changes to the proposed text as published in the July 8, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3917). These rules will not be republished. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION The purpose of the new rules is to move HHSC rules in 25 TAC Chapter 414, Subchapter P and 40 TAC Chapter 4, Subchap- ter P to 26 TAC Chapter 925 as part of consolidating HHSC rules. The adopted rules have up-to-date agency information, research protocols, population language, and includes plain lan- guage where possible. The adoption of repealed 25 TAC Chap- ter 414, Subchapter P, concerning Research in TDMHMR Facili- ties, and repealed 40 TAC Chapter 4, Subchapter P, concerning Research in State Facilities, are published simultaneously else- where in this issue of the Texas Register. The adopted rules describe the components and use of an in- stitutional review board for the review of research requests and activities pertaining to mental health, substance use, and intel- lectual or developmental disabilities services within HHSC, in- volving one or more of the following: or services; HHSC intellectual or developmental dis- abilities services; data owned or created regarding individuals receiving HHSC services; or related HHSC resources (e.g., em- ployees, property, and non-public information). COMMENTS The 31-day comment period ended August 8, 2022. During this period, HHSC received comments regarding the pro- posed rules from the Texas Medical Association (TMA). A sum- mary of comments relating to the rules and HHSC's responses follow. Comment: TMA requested clarification of the research review process when an external institutional review board (IRB) is the designated IRB. TMA recommended edits to the rules regarding which IRB or person has final approval or disapproval and the timing within the review process this decision occurs. Addition- ally, TMA recommended editing the rules to include the process for and steps following the determination by the IRB2 that an ad- ditional review is needed. Response: HHSC agrees with the comment and added the fol- lowing language to \u00a7925.7(e)(1)(D) for clarity, \"Any approval by an external IRB is subject to HHSC policy requirements.\" Comment: TMA recommended modifying \u00a7925.8(a)(2)(A) to in- clude that the qualified professional determining whether an in- dividual has capacity to consent to a research study is indepen- dent of the research study. Response: HHSC disagrees and declines to revise the rule in response to this comment. A primary function of the IRB, which is an independent board, is to review the appropriateness of an investigator's informed consent process, which includes deter- mining the capacity to consent by individuals who may partici- pate in the research. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 45, Section 46.116, governing IRB activities, sets forth re- quirements on how informed consent must be obtained and does not require the qualified professional to be independent of the re- search study. Section 925.8 requires an investigator to ensure compliance with 45 CFR \u00a746.116. ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7731 Comment: TMA recommended adding language to \u00a7925.8(a)(7) to require that the preferred modes of communication for prospective human subjects receiving HHSC intellectual and developmental services are considered for purposes of as- sessing their capacity to consent or attempting to obtain their consent or assent to participation. Response: HHSC agrees with the recommendation and modi- fied \u00a7925.8(a)(7) to include, \"The procedures must take into con- sideration a prospective human subject's preferred method of communication for consent or objection.\" A minor editorial change to \u00a7925.3(12) was made to include a section symbol; and a minor editorial change was made to \u00a7925.6(a)(1) to correct a reference. STATUTORY AUTHORITY The new sections are authorized by Texas Government Code \u00a7531.0055, which provides that the Executive Commissioner of HHSC shall adopt rules for the operation and provision of ser- vices by the health and human services agencies, and Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7574.154. \u00a7925.3.

(A) Scholarly and journalistic activities (e.g., oral his- tory, journalism, biography, literary criticism, legal research, and his- torical scholarship), including the collection and use of information, that focus directly on the specific individuals about whom the informa- tion is collected. (B) Public health surveillance activities, including the collection and testing of information or biospecimens, conducted, sup- ported, requested, ordered, required, or authorized by a public health authority. Such activities are limited to those necessary to allow a pub- lic health authority to identify, monitor, assess, or investigate poten- tial public health signals, onsets of disease outbreaks, or conditions of public health importance (including trends, signals, risk factors, pat- terns in diseases, or increases in injuries from using consumer prod- ucts). Such activities include those associated with providing timely situational awareness and priority setting during an event or crisis that threatens public health (including natural or man-made disasters). (C) Collection and analysis of information, biospeci- mens, or records by or for a criminal justice agency for activities au- thorized by law or court order solely for criminal justice or criminal investigative purposes. (D) Authorized operational activities (as determined by each agency) in support of intelligence, homeland security, defense, or other national security missions.

If an IRB suspends or terminates research, the IRB must promptly notify the following in writing of the suspension or termina- tion and include a statement of the reasons for the IRB's action: (1) the principal investigator; (2) the appropriate HHSC services authorized person; and (3) the IRB2. (c) When IRB2 is not the designated IRB for a research pro- tocol, a reliance agreement will be signed by the IRB2 chair outlining all oversight responsibilities and obligations in order to ensure the pro- tection of human subjects. \u00a7925.7. Review and Approval of Proposed Research. (a) Proposed research must be submitted to the designated in- stitutional review board (IRB) and contain written information for the IRB to determine whether the requirements described in 45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) \u00a746.111 are satisfied. (b) Each designated IRB shall review all proposed research in accordance with 45 CFR \u00a746.109. (c) Each designated IRB has the authority to approve, require modifications to, or disapprove any proposed research. Approval of proposed research shall be based on: (1) consideration of the information described in 45 CFR \u00a746.111; (2) the designated IRB's verification that the requirements in 45 CFR \u00a746.111, \u00a7925.4 of this chapter (relating to General Prin- ciples), and \u00a7925.8 of this chapter (relating to Informed Consent) are met; and (3) the designated IRB's verification that procedures for obtaining and documenting authorization to use or disclose protected health information (PHI) meet the requirements in 45 CFR \u00a7164.508, unless: (A) the designated IRB approves a waiver or alteration of the authorization requirement as permitted in \u00a7925.9(b) of this chap- ter (relating to Using and Disclosing Protected Health Information in Research); or (B) the designated IRB determines and documents that: (i) the data needed for the research is contained in a limited data set and the investigator will comply with the requirements in 45 CFR \u00a7164.514(e), including the execution of a data use agree- ment; or (ii) the data needed for the research is limited to decedents' PHI and documentation submitted by the investigator meets the requirements in 45 CFR \u00a7164.512(i)(1). (d) The designated IRB may take into consideration delibera- tions and reviews from another IRB that has approved the protocol for a specific research proposal, but the designated IRB is ultimately re- sponsible for approval of the proposed research. (e) Research review and documentation process. (1) External IRB as the designated IRB. The research re- view and documentation process for research using an external IRB is generally as follows. (A) The IRB2 screens the research proposal and, if de- termined appropriate for implementation, the investigator submits the research proposal to the external IRB for review. (B) The external IRB reviews the research proposal. (C) The investigator informs the IRB2 of the external IRB's approval or disapproval. The IRB2 informs the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) services authorized person of the external IRB's approval or disapproval. (D) Any approval by an external IRB is subject to HHSC policy requirements. (2) IRB2 as the designated IRB. The research review and documentation process for research involving HHSC services using the IRB2 is generally as follows. (A) The principal investigator submits the proposal to the IRB2. (B) The IRB2 reviews the research proposal. (C) The IRB2 informs the HHSC services authorized person of the IRB2's approval or disapproval and recommendations, if any. (D) If the research proposal is approved by the IRB2, the HHSC services authorized person considers the IRB2's recommen- 47 TexReg 7734 November 18, 2022 Texas Register dations, if any, and either approves or disapproves the research proposal for implementation. (f) In addition to approval by the designated IRB and HHSC services authorized person, review and approval by the chief medical officer or chief medical director of the state hospitals, state supported living centers, or other entity primarily responsible for the health and safety of the research subjects, as applicable, is required for any re- search proposal involving: (1) a placebo as the primary medication therapy; (2) medication or doses of medication as the primary med- ication therapy with an unknown effectiveness for the targeted disorder or condition; or (3) an investigational medication or device. (g) The review process for proposed research may require ad- ditional steps as necessary, (e.g., in the event a proposal is initially re- jected). (h) The HHSC services authorized person is responsible for ensuring that all investigators are qualified to perform any clinical du- ties assigned to them and are knowledgeable of HHSC's rules govern- ing the care and protection of individuals as described in 25 TAC Chap- ter 404, Subchapter E (relating to Rights of Persons Receiving Men- tal Health Services) and 40 TAC Chapter 4, Subchapter C (relating to Rights of Individuals with an Intellectual Disability). \u00a7925.8. Informed Consent. Requirements for approval of proposed research. Investigators shall ensure: (1) procedures for obtaining and documenting informed consent meet the requirements in 45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) \u00a746.116 and 45 CFR \u00a746.117 and address: (A) any extension of the subject's length of stay because of participation in the research; (B) the subject's ability to receive the medication or de- vice after the research has concluded if the research involves an inves- tigational medication or device; (C) whether the research involves the use of a placebo and the likelihood of assignment to the placebo condition; (D) whether the research involves medication or doses of medication which are known to be ineffective for the targeted disor- der or condition and the likelihood of assignment to such medication or doses of medication; and (E) any risk of deterioration in the subject's condition and the potential consequences of such deterioration (e.g., an exten- sion in the length of stay, or the use of interventions, such as restraint, seclusion, or emergency medications); (2) there are procedures to ensure prospective human sub- jects are assessed for capacity to consent for research protocols that present greater than minimal risk, and: (A) provide for a qualified professional to assess prospective human subjects for capacity to consent; (B) identify and document who will conduct the assess- ments; and (C) describe the nature of the assessment and justifica- tion if less formal procedures to assess capacity will be used; (3) the requirements in 45 CFR \u00a746.408 are met if children are the proposed human subjects; (4) there are procedures that: (A) each prospective human subject or the subject's legally authorized representative (LAR) understands the information provided before obtaining consent to research participation; and (B) if consent is obtained from the subject's LAR, at- tempts are made, to the extent possible given the prospective subject's capacity, to obtain the human subject's assent to participation. Assent is an affirmative agreement of a prospective human subject to partici- pate in research, which is obtained when the subject does not have the capacity or legal authority to consent; (5) there are adequate safeguards to minimize the possi- bility of coercion or undue influence. For example, the possible ad- vantages of the subject's participation in the research may not be so valuable as to impair the subject's ability to weigh the risks of the re- search against those advantages. Possible advantages within the lim- ited choice environment may include enhancement of general living conditions, medical care, quality of food, or amenities; opportunity for earnings; or a change in commitment status; (6) there are procedures for ensuring a prospective human subject's objection to enrollment in research or a human subject's ob- jection to continued participation in a research protocol is heeded in all circumstances, regardless of whether the subject or the subject's LAR has given consent. Objection may be conveyed verbally, in writing, behaviorally, or by other indications or means; and (7) procedures to ensure, throughout the course of the re- search study, human subjects' comprehension and capacity are assessed and enhanced since informed consent is an ongoing process. The pro- cedures must take into consideration a prospective human subject's pre- ferred method of communication for consent or objection. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the adop- tion and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal au- thority.

NATURAL RESOURCES AND CONSERVATION PART 2. TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT CHAPTER 51. EXECUTIVE SUBCHAPTER G. NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS 31 TAC \u00a751.168 The Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission in a duly noticed meeting on August 25, 2022 adopted new 31 TAC \u00a751.168, ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7735 concerning Promotion of Hunting and Fishing by Military Veter- ans, without changes to the proposed text as published in the July 8, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3924). The rule will not be republished. The new rule provides a process for selecting one or more non-profit partners (NPP) that exclusively serve veterans to promote hunting and fishing by those veterans and guidelines under which a representative of or a veteran served by an approved nonprofit partner may engage in hunting or fishing activities under the section. House Bill 1728, enacted during the most recent regular session of the Texas Legislature, authorized the department to select and cooperate with one or more nonprofit partners that exclusively serve veterans to promote hunting and fishing by those veter- ans. Under the provisions of the bill, a veteran who is a Texas resident and who is served by a selected nonprofit may hunt or fish on one day without holding the required license for that ac- tivity if accompanied by a representative of the nonprofit partner (NPP) who holds the appropriate license. The bill requires the department to adopt rules governing \"guidelines under which a representative of or a veteran served by a nonprofit partner may engage in hunting or fishing activities.\" Subsection (a) of the new rule provides that the selection of NPPs shall be made according to existing department rules re- garding nonprofit partners, as applicable, and is restricted to NPPs serving residents of Texas who are veterans of the U.S. armed forces. The provision is necessary to provide a structure for agency interaction with qualified NPPs and to comply with statutory requirements restricting the types of NPPs authorized to engage in the activities regulated under the rule. Subsection (b) establishes guidelines for participation in hunt- ing and fishing activities pursuant to the section. The new rule requires all hunting and angling activities to be provided by a se- lected NPP to be on private lands and/or public waters, which is necessary to ensure that hunting opportunity provided under the section is additive to and not at the expense of hunting opportu- nity for the general public on public lands. The new subsection also requires all hunting and angling activity under the section to be in accordance with all regulations that prescribe seasons, bag limits, gear restrictions, lawful means and methods, and spe- cial provisions governing the take of wildlife resources, which is necessary because the department has a statutory obligation to conserve, protect, and manage the fish and wildlife resources of the state in order to provide the public with the benefits of enjoy- ment of those resources and therefore believes that all hunting and fishing activities should be conducted consistent with exist- ing regulations intended to accomplish that duty. The new sub- section also requires that the selection of veterans for participa- tion in hunting and fishing activities under the section be by a fair and equitable method advertised by public notice, which is necessary to prevent favoritism or the appearance of favoritism in allocating opportunity for qualifying persons to enjoy the ben- efits of wildlife resources, which are a public trust resource. Additionally, the new subsection requires all hunting and fishing opportunity provided under the section to be at no cost to partic- ipants, which is necessary in order to ensure that measures in- tended as a gesture of gratitude for national service are not mis- used by unscrupulous persons as an opportunity for monetary gain. The new subsection also imposes reporting and record- keeping requirements necessary for the department to ensure that all hunting and angling activities are consistent with appli- cable statutory and regulatory provisions, including provisions governing eligibility for participation, documentation of the iden- tities of participants, and the dates, times, and locations that regulated activities took place, which is necessary for the de- partment to verify that activities under the section are conducted in accordance with both legislative intent and the regulations of the commission. Finally, the new section would waive stamp endorsement requirements and provide for documentation of re- sources taken by participants, which is necessary because by statute, participants are not required to obtain or possess a hunt- ing or fishing license and therefore will not have tags or stamp endorsements required of other hunters, necessitating alterna- tive documentation processes for the department to be able to determine that all hunting and angling activity is conducted in a lawful manner. The department received no comments opposing adoption of the rule as proposed. The department received three comments supporting adoption of the rule as proposed. The new rule is adopted under the authority of Parks and Wildlife Code, \u00a711.208, which allows the commission to establish by rule the criteria under which the department may select the nonprofit partner and the guidelines under which a representative of or a veteran served by a nonprofit partner may engage in hunting or fishing activities provided by the nonprofit partner; Parks and Wildlife Code, \u00a742.0177, which authorizes the commission to modify or eliminate the tagging, carcass, final destination, or final processing requirements or other similar requirements or provi- sions in Chapter 42; Parks and Wildlife Code, \u00a743.402, which au- thorizes the commission to exempt by rule a person from require- ments regarding purchase and possession of saltwater fishing stamps; \u00a743.652, which authorizes the commission to exempt a person or class of persons by rule from the upland or migra- tory game bird stamp requirements; \u00a743.802, which authorizes the commission to exempt a person by rule from the freshwater fishing stamp requirement; and \u00a746.0086, which authorizes the commission by regulation to exempt a person from the finfish tag requirement of that chapter. The proposed new rule affects Parks and Wildlife Code, Chap- ters 11, 42, 43, and 46. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the adop- tion and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal au- thority.

FINANCE SUBCHAPTER A. FEES DIVISION 1. LICENSE, PERMIT, AND BOAT AND MOTOR FEES 47 TexReg 7736 November 18, 2022 Texas Register 31 TAC \u00a753.15 The Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission in a duly noticed meeting on August 25, 2022, adopted an amendment to 31 TAC \u00a753.15, concerning Miscellaneous Fisheries and Wildlife Licenses and Permits, without changes to the proposed text as published in the July 8, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3925). The rule will not be republished. The amendment removes the cormorant control permit from the fee catalogue. In another rule action published elsewhere in this issue of the Texas Register, the department adopts the repeal of 31 TAC \u00a765.901, concerning Cormorant Control Permit, which the department no longer has the authority to issue. Therefore, references to that permit are being removed from various sec- tions of department rules. The department received no comments opposing adoption of the proposed amendment. The department received eight comments supporting adoption of the proposed amendment. The amendment is adopted under the authority of Parks and Wildlife Code, Chapter 67, which authorizes the commission to establish any limits on the taking, possession, propagation, transportation, importation, exportation, sale, or offering for sale of nongame fish or wildlife that the department considers necessary to manage the species. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the adop- tion and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal au- thority.

AGENCY DECISION TO REFUSE LICENSE OR PERMIT ISSUANCE OR RENEWAL AND AGENCY DECISION TO SUSPEND OR REVOKE AFFECTED LICENSE OR PERMIT 31 TAC \u00a7\u00a756.1 - 56.7 The Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission in a duly noticed meeting on August 25, 2022 adopted new 31 TAC \u00a7\u00a756.1 - 56.7, concerning Agency Decision to Refuse License or Permit Is- suance or Renewal and Agency Decision to Suspend or Revoke Affected License or Permit, with changes to the proposed text as published in the July 22, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4267). The rules will be republished. The new rules constitute new Chapter 56 and implement the di- rectives of the Texas Sunset Advisory Commission by establish- ing a uniform process to govern department decisions to refuse issuance or renewal of non-recreational licenses and permits for which such processes are not prescribed by statute and pre- scribe a similar process regarding agency decisions to suspend or revoke a license or permit affected by the new subchapter. Under Government Code, Chapter 325, the Sunset Advisory Commission is required to conduct reviews of state agencies to determine if a public need exists for the continuation of a state agency and to identify areas for improvement. Typically, state agencies undergo sunset review once every 12 years. The de- partment underwent sunset review during the last regular ses- sion of the legislature and was reauthorized to continue in exis- tence until September 1, 2033. As part of that process, the Sun- set Advisory Commission adopted recommendations aimed to improve consistency and fairness for individuals and small busi- ness owners licensed by the department, including a directive to provide an option for an informal review for non-recreational li- cense types that do not have an existing statutory review process and alignment of criminal and administrative enforcement pro- cesses to ensure fair, strong, and consistent enforcement. New \u00a756.1, concerning Definitions, creates unambiguous mean- ings for specialized words and terms used in the rules. \"Appli- cant\" would be defined as \"a person who seeks to obtain a li- cense or permit issued by the department.\" The definition is nec- essary to make clear that an applicant is a person who seeks to obtain a license or permit generally, whether initial permit or li- cense issuance or renewal. \"Final conviction\" would be defined as \"a final judgment of guilt, the granting of deferred adjudica- tion or pretrial diversion, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere.\" The definition is necessary to make explicit the var- ious juridical outcomes upon which the processes described in the rules are predicated. \"License or Permit\" would be defined as \"a non-recreational license or permit issued by the depart- ment, including but not limited to the licenses and permits listed in \u00a756.7 of this title,\" which is necessary to identify the specific licenses and permits to which the rules apply, and to definitively exclude licenses and permits for which the process of denying permit or license issuance or referral is wholly or partially pre- scribed by statute. New \u00a756.2, concerning Refusal to Issue or Renew Permit or License, identifies the specific types of criminal conduct to be considered by the department in determining whether to issue or renew a permit or license. The department believes that a decision to issue or renew a license or permit should take into account the applicant's history of violations involving the possession of live animals; the commercial exploitation of public wildlife and fisheries resources; major violations of the Parks and Wildlife Code (Class B misdemeanors, Class A misdemeanors, and felonies); specific provisions of the Penal Code involving falsification of governmental records and animal cruelty; and federal laws applicable to conduct regarding unlawful wildlife trafficking or violations of federal airborne hunting laws. The department reasons that it is ap- propriate to deny the privilege of possessing live wildlife or engaging in the commercial exploitation of a public wildlife resource to persons who exhibit a demonstrable disregard for the statutes and regulations governing such activities. Similarly, it is appropriate to deny such privileges to a person who has exhibited demonstrable disregard for fish and wildlife law in general by committing more egregious (Class B misdemeanors, Class A misdemeanors, and felonies) violations of wildlife law. The department also believes that persons with a criminal history of disregard for honesty or truthfulness with respect to furnishing information required by law in applications, reports, or communications involving governmental records should be ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7737 prevented from the privilege of possessing or benefiting from wildlife resources. The department is the primary state agency responsible for managing, protecting, and conserving public wildlife and fisheries resources and is statutorily authorized or required to issue a wide variety of permits and licenses for many purposes, including, variously, the take, possession, use, propagation, importation, exportation, purchase, sale, etc., of those resources. As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, the department believes that unscrupulous persons and persons known to exhibit disregard for the law should not enjoy the privileges of exploitation of a public trust resource because their behavior is evidence that they cannot be expected to discharge the responsibilities, requirements, and expectations attendant to such privileges. One example and indication of unscrupu- lous character is the lack of fidelity to the truth with respect to providing information required by the department to effectively assess and determine a person's fitness to be allowed to exploit a public trust resource. The department reasons that a person who is untruthful in furnishing information to the department, in addition to committing the criminal offense of falsification of a government record, will be similarly indisposed to faithfully follow and discharge the requirements of a permit or license to exploit a public trust. The department similarly believes that persons who have been convicted of animal cruelty should not be allowed to possess or benefit from the possession or use of wildlife resources. Animal cruelty is the intentional or reckless disregard for animal welfare that results in unwarranted or unjustified pain or suffering and includes torture, poisoning, killing, causing serious injury, failure to provide necessary food, water, care, or shelter, abandonment, and other, similar, types of abuse. The department reasons that persons with a demonstra- ble history of either failure to care for animals in that person's custody or the opportunistic infliction of pain and suffering on animals cannot be entrusted with a permit or license to possess live wildlife resources and should not be able to benefit from any other activity that involves the take and use of live wildlife resources. Therefore, the new rules specify that the department may refuse permit or renewal issuance to persons who have been finally convicted of or received deferred adjudication for a violation of Parks and Wildlife Code, Chapter 43, Subchapters C (Permits for Scientific Research, Zoological Collection, Re- habilitation, and Educational Display), E (Permits for Trapping, Transporting and Transplanting Game Animals and Game Birds), G (Permits to Manage Wildlife and Exotic Animals from Aircraft) , L (Deer Breeder's Permit), or R (Deer Management Permit - White-tailed Deer) or R-1 (Deer Management Permit - Mule Deer); violations of the Parks and Wildlife Code or rules of the commission that are Class A or B misdemeanors, felonies or state jail felonies; violations of Parks and Wildlife Code, \u00a763.002 (which although a Class C misdemeanor, specifically addresses the unlawful possession of live game animals); Penal Code, \u00a737.10 (Tampering with Governmental Record); Penal Code, \u00a742.092 (Cruelty to Nonlivestock Animals); the federal Lacey Act; the federal Airborne Hunting Act; or any statutory or regulatory provision involving conduct or behavior regulated by the permit or license the applicant seeks to obtain or renew. The Lacey Act (16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a73371 - 3378) is a federal law that, among other things, prohibits interstate trade in or movement of wildlife, fish, or plants taken, possessed, transported or sold in violation of state law. Lacey Act prosecutions are normally conducted by the United States Department of Justice in federal courts. The department believes that it is reasonable to include and use a Lacey Act conviction or civil penalty as the basis for denial of a license or permit subject to the provisions of the rule. The new rule also allows the department to refuse permit or li- cense issuance or renewal for any statutory or regulatory pro- vision not described in subsection (a)(1)-(6) that involves con- duct or behavior regulated by the permit or license the applicant seeks to obtain or renew. The new rule sets forth the criteria to be used in determining whether a criminal conviction directly re- lates to the duties and responsibilities required under a permit or license sought by an applicant, including the relationship of the crime to the purposes for which a license or permit listed in \u00a756.5 of this title is required; the extent to which the issuance of a license or permit might offer an opportunity to engage in fur- ther criminal activity of the same type as that in which the person previously had been involved; the relationship of the crime to the ability or capacity required to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities under the license or permit being sought; and any correlation between the elements of the crime and the duties and responsibilities of the license or permit being sought. In addition to providing for the possible refusal to issue or renew a license or permit on the basis of criminal conduct, the new rule provides for the ability of the department to deny license or permit issuance or renewal on the basis of noncompliance with appli- cable administrative provisions. Virtually all of the licenses and permits affected by the new rules require some form of admin- istrative process and oversight, including application processes, the payment of fees, and reporting and/or notification require- ments. The application process is used by the department to en- sure that a prospective permitee or licensee is qualified to and/or capable of enjoying the privileges of the license or permit. The information contained in reports and notifications is used by the department for a variety of oversight and management purposes, including as a measure to determine regulatory compliance dur- ing the period of validity of the permit or license. Therefore, sub- section (b) provides that the department may refuse to issue or renew a permit or license if an applicant fails to submit a com- pleted application (including all application materials required by the department), the required fee, accurate required reports or notifications, and any additional information or material the de- partment determines necessary to process the application. Subsection (c) provides for denial of permit or license issuance or renewal on the basis of outstanding debt owed to the depart- ment by the applicant. The department is the regulatory authority for a wide variety of programs and activities, including hunting, recreational fishing, commercial fishing, operation of the state parks system, water safety, boat and motor titling, environmental protection and much more. Most regulated entities and activities are subject to fees of various kinds, and criminal violations can result in fines. Under Parks and Wildlife Code, \u00a712.301, a person who kills, catches, takes, possesses, or injures any fish, shell- fish, reptile, amphibian, bird, or animal in violation of the Parks and Wildlife Code or regulation of the department is liable to the state for the value of each fish, shellfish, reptile, amphibian, bird, or animal unlawfully killed, caught, taken, possessed, or injured. Such payments are commonly referred to as \"civil restitution.\" The department believes that it is entirely reasonable to deny permit or license issuance or renewal to any applicant who is indebted to the department, including those who have failed to remit required payments to the department as civil restitution for violation of conservation law. Subsection (d) establishes the criteria used by the department to guide a decision to refuse permit or license issuance or re- newal. The department does not intend for denial of permit or license issuance or renewal to be either automatic or perma- nent; accordingly, the subsection establishes a matrix of various 47 TexReg 7738 November 18, 2022 Texas Register factors to be considered when making a determination to deny permit or license issuance or renewal. Those factors include the extent and nature of the person's past criminal activity with re- spect to the factors identified, the age of the person when the crime was committed, the amount of time that has elapsed since the person's last criminal activity involving factors identified in this section, the conduct and work activity of the person before and after the criminal activity, evidence of the person's rehabili- tation or rehabilitative effort while incarcerated or after release; evidence of the person's compliance with any conditions of com- munity supervision, parole, or mandatory supervision, other ev- idence of the person's fitness, including letters of recommenda- tion; and any other adverse or mitigating factors, including the number of final convictions or administrative penalties; the seri- ousness of the conduct on which the final conviction or adminis- trative penalty is based; the existence, number, and seriousness of offenses or violations other than offenses or violations that re- sulted in a final conviction or administrative penalty; the length of time between the most recent final conviction or administrative penalty and the permit or license application; whether the final conviction, administrative penalty, or other offense or violation was the result of negligence or intentional conduct; whether the final conviction or administrative penalty resulted from conduct committed or omitted by the applicant, an agent of the applicant, or both; the accuracy of the permit or license history information provided by the applicant; whether the applicant for a permit or license renewal agreed to any special provisions recommended by the department as conditions to the expiring permit. New \u00a756.3, concerning Subpermittees, Volunteers, Agents, and Surrogates, addresses the various peripheral roles of persons other than the permittee or licensee who are authorized to en- gage in activities authorized under a permit or license. In many cases, authorized activities are conducted by other persons in addition to the permittee. The department believes that, in addi- tion to provisions affecting permittees, it is appropriate to prevent persons who have been convicted of or received deferred adju- dication for an offense that otherwise is a reason for license or permit denial from assisting in activities involving live animals or that are conducted for the personal benefit of the permitee or licensee. The provision is necessary to prevent unscrupulous persons from circumventing the intent of the department (that they not engage in an activity for which they are prohibited from obtaining a license or permit to conduct) by using another person to obtain a permit with the objective of continuing to do business as usual in the name of the shadow permittee. New \u00a756.4, concerning Review of Agency Decision to Deny Issuance or Renewal of License or Permit, creates a review process for department decisions concerning the issuance and renewal of licenses and permits. The rule is necessary to create a process to allow persons who have been denied issuance of permits or permit renewals to have the decision reviewed by a panel of senior department managers. The process allows the department to reverse such decisions upon further review. New \u00a756.5, concerning Revocation or Suspension of License or Permit, prescribes the informal, internal process and criteria used by the department to revoke or suspend an affected permit or license. The new section utilizes the same criteria enumer- ated in new \u00a756.2, concerning Refusal to Issue or Renew Permit of License, as the basis for pursuing revocation or suspension of an affected license or permit, and would employ the same process for making determinations. The department notes that the new rule creates an informal internal administrative process that is in addition to but does not replace, negate, or supersede the provisions of Parks and Wildlife Code, Chapter 12, Subchap- ter F, which governs the revocation or suspension of all licenses or permits issued by the department. New \u00a756.6, concerning Review of Agency Decision to Seek Re- vocation or Suspension of a License or Permit, creates a review process for department decisions concerning revocation or sus- pension of affected licenses or permits. The new rule is neces- sary to create a process to allow persons whom the department has determined should have an affected license or permit re- voked or suspended to have the decision reviewed by a panel of senior department managers. The new rule is substantively identical to new \u00a756.4, concerning Review of Agency Decision to Deny Issuance or Renewal of License or Permit. The depart- ment notes that the new rule creates an informal internal ad- ministrative process that is in addition to but does not replace, negate, or supersede the provisions of Parks and Wildlife Code, Chapter 12, Subchapter F, which governs the revocation or sus- pension of all licenses or permits issued by the department. New \u00a756.7, concerning Permits and Licenses Affected, lists the specific licenses and permits identified by the Sunset Advisory Commission to which the new rules apply. The department received no public comment opposing or sup- porting adoption of the rules as proposed. The new rules are adopted under Parks and Wildlife Code, \u00a712.001, which authorizes the department to collect and enforce the payment of all taxes, licenses, fines, and forfeitures due to the department; \u00a712.508, which authorizes the department to refuse to issue or transfer an original or renewal license, permit, or tag if the applicant or transferee has been finally convicted of a violation under the Parks and Wildlife Code or rule adopted or a proclamation issued under the Parks and Wildlife Code; \u00a731.0412, which authorizes the commission to adopt rules regarding licenses issued under Parks and Wildlife Code, \u00a731.041, including rules regarding application and re- newal procedures; \u00a731.180, which authorizes the commission to promulgate rules necessary to implement Parks and Wildlife Code, Chapter 31, Subchapter G; \u00a743.022, which requires the commission to adopt rules to govern the collecting, hold- ing, possession, propagation, release, display, or transport of protected wildlife for scientific research, educational display, zo- ological collection, or rehabilitation; \u00a743.109, which authorizes the commission to make regulations governing management of wildlife or exotic animals by the use of aircraft; Chapter 43, Subchapter F, which authorizes the commission to adopt regulations necessary to administer that subchapter; Chapter 43, Subchapter H, which authorizes the commission to adopt rules to implement that subchapter; \u00a743.855, which authorizes the commission to adopt rules to implement Parks and Wildlife Code, Chapter 43, Subchapter V, including rules to govern permit application forms, fees, and procedures; Chapter 44, which provides for the applicability of all laws and regulations of the state to game animals held under a game breeder's license; Chapter 49, which authorizes the commission to prescribe eligibility requirements and fees for and issue any falconry, raptor propagation, or nonresident trapping permit; \u00a765.003, which authorizes the commission to promulgate regulations to provide for permit application forms, fees, and procedures, and hearing procedures; \u00a766.007, which authorizes the department shall make rules governing the issuance and use of permits to possess harmful or potentially exotic harmful fish, shellfish, and aquatic plants; Chapter 67, which authorizes the commission to establish any limitations on the taking, possession, propagation, ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7739 transportation, importation, exportation, sale, or offering for sale of nongame fish or wildlife that the department considers necessary to manage the species; \u00a771.002, which authorizes the commission to promulgate regulations to provide for permit application forms, fees, and procedures, and hearing proce- dures; Chapter 77, which authorizes the commission to regulate the catching, possession, purchase, and sale of shrimp; and Chapter 78, which authorizes the commission to regulate the taking, possession, purchase, and sale of mussels and clams. \u00a756.1.

FISHERIES SUBCHAPTER A. HARMFUL OR POTENTIALLY HARMFUL FISH, SHELLFISH, AND AQUATIC PLANTS 31 TAC \u00a757.111, \u00a757.114 The Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission in a duly noticed meeting on August 25, 2022 adopted amendments to 31 TAC \u00a757.111, concerning Definitions, and \u00a757.114, concerning Con- trolled Exotic Species Permits, without changes to the proposed text as published in July 8, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3927). The rules will not be republished. The amendments will function in concert to remove ambiguity concerning the circumstances under which the department issues permits authorizing the possession of controlled exotic species for zoological display purposes. The purpose of the rules in this subchapter is to minimize to the greatest extent possible the documented and unquestioned risk posed to indigenous species and ecosystems by exotic fish, shellfish, and aquatic plants. The department considers this threat to encompass not only the direct threat posed by possession of such species and their accidental or intentional release, but the indirect threat posed by lack of public awareness of their dangers, including perceptions that exotic species are somehow benign, unimportant, or not worth worrying about. To this end, the department maintains a robust, continuous public relations effort to educate and equip the public with information about the dangers posed by exotic species. Current rule allows for the issuance of an exotic species permit for purposes of educational display, under which the sale or in- tentional propagation of controlled exotic species is prohibited. As noted earlier in this discussion, the department believes that educating the public about the threat of exotic species is impor- tant and, therefore, that there is value and public benefit in the issuance of controlled exotic species permits for that purpose; however, the department also considers that the most appropri- ate and effective vehicles for such educational efforts are entities established and operated for the purpose of educating the pub- lic about natural history, ecology, and the sciences (museums, aquaria, nature centers, and so forth). The department is con- cerned that the display of controlled exotic species in commer- cial and retail environments where animals and/or aquatic plants are sold to the public is problematic because it could result in public perception that the controlled exotic species on display in such environments, even if the specimens are not for sale, are appropriate, desirable, or lawful for hobbyists to obtain, which in turn could drive market demand for exotic species and pose additional threats to native species and ecosystems, as one of the main components of the spread of exotic species is their in- tentional or accidental release to the wild for various reasons. Therefore, the amendments will function to restrict the issuance of controlled exotic species permits for zoological display only to facilities that the department determines are engaged in bona fide educational activities and do not engage in the sale of fish, shellfish, wildlife, or aquatic plants. The amendment to \u00a757.111, concerning Definitions, defines \"zo- ological facility\" as \"A zoo, aquarium, nature center, or other, similar facility that is open to the public, operated for the purpose of furthering scientific understanding, encouraging management and conservation, or furthering awareness and understanding of biology, and does not engage in commercial or retail activities in- volving the sale of animals or aquatic plants.\" The amendment to \u00a757.114, concerning Controlled Exotic Species Permits, provides for the issuance of permits authoriz- ing the possession of controlled exotic species for purposes of educational display at a zoological facility that the department has determined exists for the bona fide purpose of educating the public and not for any ancillary or additional commercial purpose that involves the sale of animals or aquatic plants. The department received no comments opposing adoption of the rules as proposed. The department received two comments supporting adoption of the rules as proposed. The amendments are adopted under the authority of Parks and Wildlife Code, \u00a766.007 and \u00a766.0072, which authorize the de- partment to make rules necessary to authorize the import, pos- session, sale, or introduction of harmful or potentially harmful exotic fish, shellfish, and aquatic plants. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the adop- tion and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal au- thority.

The rule will not be republished. The amendment adopts by reference a revised MOU adopted by the TCEQ and published in the May 13, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 2864). The amendment also retitles the section to reflect the fact that TDA is no longer involved in aquaculture facility licensure. The amendment is necessary to implement applicable pro- visions of Senate Bill (S.B.) 703, 87th Legislature, Regular Session, which eliminated TDA's primary role and responsibili- ties related to regulation of aquaculture (i.e., facility licensure). Prior to the enactment of S.B. 703, regulation of aquaculture in Texas was coordinated by the terms of an MOU between the department, TCEQ, and TDA, as required by statute. The amendment adopts by reference a revised MOU that reflects the removal of TDA's regulatory licensure role with respect to aquaculture and delineates each agency's responsibilities. The revised MOU outlines coordination procedures for the review of revisions of the TCEQ Aquaculture General Permit and individual wastewater discharge permit applications and notices of intent to be covered under the TCEQ general permit and establishes operating procedures and scope. The department received no comments opposing adoption of the rule as proposed. The department received one comment supporting adoption of the rule as proposed. The rule is adopted under Agriculture Code, \u00a7134.031, which requires the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to enter into a mem- orandum of understanding for the regulation of matters related to aquaculture, and \u00a7134.005, which requires the commission to adopt rules to carry out duties under the chapter. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the adop- tion and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal au- thority.

WILDLIFE SUBCHAPTER I. DEPREDATION PERMITS 31 TAC \u00a765.221 The Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission in a duly noticed meeting on August 25, 2022, adopted an amendment to 31 TAC \u00a765.221, concerning General Provisions, without changes to the proposed text as published in the July 8, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3943). The rule will not be republished. The amendment removes a reference to the cormorant control permit. In another rule action published elsewhere in this issue of the Texas Register, the department adopts the repeal of 31 TAC \u00a765.901, concerning Cormorant Control Permit, which the department no longer has the authority to issue. Therefore, ref- erences to that permit are being removed from various sections of department rules. The department received no comments opposing adoption of the proposed amendment. The department received eight comments supporting adoption of the proposed amendment. The amendment is adopted under the authority of Parks and Wildlife Code, Chapter 43, Subchapter H, which authorizes the commission to adopt rules to implement that subchapter, and Chapter 67, which authorizes the commission to establish any limits on the taking, possession, propagation, transportation, im- portation, exportation, sale, or offering for sale of nongame fish or wildlife that the department considers necessary to manage the species.

SPECIAL PERMITS 31 TAC \u00a765.901 The Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission in a duly no- 47 TexReg 7744 November 18, 2022 Texas Register changes to the proposed text as published in the July 8, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3944). This rule will not be republished. The (Phalacrocorax auritus) is a long- lived, colonial-nesting waterbird native to North America, and is the most abundant of six species of cormorants occurring in North America. They are opportunistic and generalist feeders, preying on many species of fish, but concentrating on those that are easiest to catch. In many areas, the double-crested cor- morant is regarded as a nuisance species. The double-crested cormorant is a protected species under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, and federal approval is required to take or possess them. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) in 1998 al- lowed U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services to con- duct winter roost control on double-crested cormorants and later established a public resource depredation order to allow state wildlife agencies (including Texas), Tribes, and U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services to conduct control activities fo the protection of public resources. Under the order, the depart ment was allowed to authorize agents to conduct lethal contro activities. The current rule created a mechanism to protect publi fisheries resources from depredation by allowing persons act ing as agents of the department to control double-crested cor morants by permit on specific tracts of land. The Service i response to a court order in 2016 vacated federal regulation relating to control of depredating double-crested cormorants, a which point the department ceased issuing the state's cormoran control permit. Staff has determined that if the Service at some point authorizes the resumption of control activities, it will be in a form and manner that will be incompatible with current rule; therefore, the current rule can and should be repealed. The department received no comments opposing adoption of the proposed repeal. The department received eight comments supporting adoption of the proposed repeal. The repeal is adopted under the authority of Parks and Wildlife Code, Chapter 67, which authorizes the commission to establish any limits on the taking, possession, propagation, transportation, importation, exportation, sale, or offering for sale of nongame fish or wildlife that the department considers necessary to man- age the species.

RIGHTS AND PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY SERVICES SUBCHAPTER P. RESEARCH IN STATE FACILITIES 40 TAC \u00a7\u00a74.751 - 4.765 As required by Texas Government Code \u00a7531.0202(b), the De- partment of Aging and Disability Services (DADS) was abolished effective September 1, 2017, after all of its functions were trans- ferred to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) in accordance with Texas Government Code \u00a7531.0201 and \u00a7531.02011. Rules of the former DADS are codified in Title 40, Part 1, and will be repealed or administratively transferred to Title 26, Health and Human Services, as appropriate. Until such action is taken, the rules in Title 40, Part 1 govern functions previ- ously performed by DADS that have transferred to HHSC. Texas Government Code \u00a7531.0055, requires the Executive Commis- sioner of HHSC to adopt rules for the operation and provision of services by the health and human services system, including rules in Title 40, Part 1. Therefore, the Executive Commissioner of HHSC adopts the repeal of Title 40, Part 1, Chapter 4, Subchapter P, consist- ing of \u00a74.751, Institutional \u00a74.756, concerning IRB Functions and Opera- tions; \u00a74.757, concerning Review and Approval of Proposed Re- search; \u00a74.758, concerning Informed Consent; \u00a74.759, concern- ing Research Involving Offenders as Human Subjects; \u00a74.760, concerning Using and Disclosing Protected Health Information (PHI) in Research; \u00a74.761, concerning Investigation of Allega- tions of Misconduct in Science; \u00a74.762, concerning Responsibili- ties of the Office of Research Administration (ORA), \u00a74.763, con- cerning Exhibits; \u00a74.764, adopted without changes to the proposed text as published in the July 8, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3956). These rules will not be republished. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION The purpose of the adoption is to reflect the transition of pro- grams from DADS to HHSC. The adoption of new rules address- ing research in state hospitals, state supported living centers, and by community service providers is simultaneously published elsewhere in this issue of the Texas Register. The new rules re- flect the transition of programs to HHSC and current research protocols which align with applicable federal laws. COMMENTS The 31-day comment period ended August 8, 2022. During this period, HHSC did not receive any comments regard- ing the proposed repeals. STATUTORY AUTHORITY The repeals are authorized by Texas Government Code Chap- ter 531, Health and Human Services Commission, Section 531.0055, Executive Commissioner: General Responsibility for Health and Human Services System, which provides that the Executive Commissioner of HHSC shall adopt rules for the operation and provision of services by the health and human services agencies, and adopt rules to implement the executive commissioner's authority under this section.

The Veterans Land Board adopts the proposed amendment that will add the United States Space Force (USSF) as an eligible branch of service. The rule amendment was pub- lished in the September 23, 2022 issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 6188) and will not be republished. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION The National Defense Authorization Act of 2020 amended 10 U.S.C. effective December 20, 2019, establishing the United States Space Force (USSF) as the newest branch of the United States Armed Forces. Current and discharged members of the USSF or USSF Reserves, may be eligible for VA home loan benefits upon meeting length-of-service (LOS), and character- of-service (COS) requirements. Qualifying Surviving Spouses of Veterans who served in the USSF may also be eligible for the VA home loan benefit. On June 23, 2022, the Veterans Admin- istration issued a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) Update (Circular 26-22-10) announcing a COE enhancement to include the USSF as a branch of service. PUBLIC COMMENT REQUEST The VLB did not receive any comments during the 30-day com- ment period. STATUTORY AUTHORITY The amendments are adopted under Texas Natural Resources Code \u00a7161.001(b), that provides that the Board may by rule 47 TexReg 7746 November 18, 2022 Texas Register change the definition of \"veteran\" as necessary or appropriate to protect the best interests of the program.

DISCIPLINARY AC- TIONS/DETRIMENTAL PRACTICE/COM- PLAINT PROCESS/CODE OF ETHICS/LI- CENSURE OF PERSONS WITH CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS 40 TAC \u00a7374.3 The Texas Board of Occupational Therapy Examiners adopts amendments to the 40 Texas Administrative Code \u00a7374.3, Com- plaint Process. The amendments are adopted to remove certi- fied mail and notarized signatures requirements with regard to agreed orders. The changes will allow orders and notices to be sent by all the methods listed in Texas Government Code sec- tion 2001.054(c), and will not limit delivery to certified mail, re- turn receipt requested. The amendments are adopted without changes to the proposed text as published in the September 9, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 5452) and will not be republished. Changes to the section include the removal of requirements con- cerning the Board's use of certified mail when sending agreed orders to the respondent to a complaint. The amendments will also remove the requirement that respondents have their signa- tures notarized on agreed orders. These changes will streamline both board processes regarding mailing and requirements for respondents concerning agreed or- ders. The Board anticipates that these changes will increase the efficiency of investigative mailing processes and reduce the pos- sible complications respondents to a complaint may encounter when responding to agreed orders. The amendments also include a revision to correct a reference in the section to Texas Government Code section 2001.054(c). The change is adopted to increase the accuracy of the board rules. No comments were received regarding adoption of the amend- ments. The amendments are adopted under Texas Occupations Code \u00a7454.102, which authorizes the Board to adopt rules to carry out its duties under chapter 454, and under \u00a7454.153, which requires the Board to adopt rules relating to the investigation of a complaint received by the Board.

PART II. EXPLANATION OF INDIVIDUAL PROVISIONS (Note: Minor editorial changes are made that do not change the meaning of the rules and, therefore, are not discussed in the Explanation of Individual Provisions.) SUBCHAPTER B. ALLOCATIONS TWC adopts the following amendments to Subchapter B: \u00a7800.52. Definitions. Section 800.52(5), the definition for \"Deobligation\" is amended to add \u00a7800.78 and \u00a7800.79 to the rule reference. \u00a7800.71.

Midyear Deobligation of AEL Funds Section 800.78 is amended to rename the section \"Deobligation of AEL Funds.\" Section 800.78(a) is amended to update the reference to \u00a7800.78(d). Section 800.78(d) is deleted and the reference is updated to \u00a7800.80(a), which contains similar language to the language that was deleted. Section 800.78(a)(1) is amended to revise the time in which TWC may review expenditures for deobligation from months four to seven, to any month after month four. Section 800.78(d), which provides that amounts deobligated from an AEL grant recipient must be made available as a first priority to another grant recipient providing AEL services in the same workforce area, is deleted. The subsequent subsection is relettered accordingly. \u00a7800.80. Reallocation of AEL Funds Section 800.80 is amended to modify the criteria a grant recipi- ent must meet in order to receive deoglibated funds and revise language related to the reallocation of funds.

Section 800.80(b) is also amended to add that if AEL grant recipients outside the workforce area are not able to meet the criteria in \u00a7800.80(a), then TWC staff will present an alternate plan for the Commission's consideration.

TAX REFUND FOR WAGES PAID TO EMPLOYEE RECEIVING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE 40 TAC \u00a7\u00a7800.550 - 800.557 The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) adopts the following new subchapter to Chapter 800, relating to General Administra- tion: Subchapter M. Tax Refund for Wages Paid to Employee Receiv- ing Financial Assistance, \u00a7\u00a7800.550 - 800.557 The new sections are adopted without changes to the proposed text as published in the August 26, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 5083), and, therefore, the adopted rule text will not be republished. PART I. PURPOSE, BACKGROUND, AND AUTHORITY The purpose of new Chapter 800, Subchapter M is to establish administrative rules to clarify the requirements and eligibility de- termination applicable under Texas Labor Code, Chapter 301, Subchapter H, relating to Tax Refund for Wages Paid to Em- ployee Receiving Financial Assistance. Senate Bill (SB) 82, enacted by the 73rd Texas Legislature, Reg- ular Session (1993), amended Texas Human Resources Code, Chapter 31 by adding Subchapter D, Tax Refund for Wages Paid to Employee Receiving Financial Assistance (Tax Refund Pro- gram). The Tax Refund Program required the Texas Department of Human Services (DHS) to provide tax vouchers to persons upon application and certification of eligibility. In 1997, the 75th Texas Legislature enacted SB 1113, which transferred the Tax Refund Program from the Texas Human Re- sources Code, Chapter 31, Subchapter D to Texas Labor Code, Chapter 301, Subchapter H, effectively moving the application eligibility and certification procedures from DHS to TWC. SB 1113 also implemented new rulemaking authority, allowing TWC to \"adopt rules as necessary to carry out its powers and duties under this subchapter\" and required DHS to provide information to TWC that is required to determine eligibility for persons apply- ing for the Tax Refund. The Comptroller of Public Accounts' rule under 34 Texas Ad- ministrative Code (TAC) \u00a73.4, implemented in 1995, was not amended when the program transitioned from DHS to TWC. TWC did not establish rule to operate the Tax Refund Program. The application and eligibility certification procedures related to the Tax Refund Program have been operated by TWC staff since 1997 through publicly available information and a tax refund ap- plication form, currently maintained on TWC's Work Opportunity Tax Credit Program Overview webpage. 47 TexReg 7748 November 18, 2022 Texas Register The Comptroller's office is reviewing possible amendments to 34 TAC \u00a73.4 that would eliminate reference to eligibility deter- minations in its rule. TWC determined that the establishment of an administrative rule to clarify the requirements and eligibility determination applicable under Texas Labor Code, \u00a7301.107 is now needed. PART II. EXPLANATION OF INDIVIDUAL PROVISIONS SUBCHAPTER M. TAX REFUND FOR WAGES PAID TO EM- PLOYEE RECEIVING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TWC adopts new Subchapter M, as follows: \u00a7800.550. Purpose New \u00a7800.550 states the purpose and goal for Chapter 800, Subchapter M. \u00a7800.551. Definitions New \u00a7800.551 defines terms used in Chapter 800, Subchapter M. \u00a7800.552.

Eligibility New \u00a7800.554 describes the eligibility required for the tax re- fund. New \u00a7800.554(1) describes the eligibility requirements re- garding wages incurred by a person for service of an employee. New \u00a7800.554(2) refers to the certification requirements in new \u00a7800.555, and new \u00a7800.554(3) describes the options for a per- son to provide and pay a part of the cost for health care coverage. \u00a7800.555. Certification New \u00a7800.555 describes the time parameters for an employee to be receiving financial or medical assistance prior to employment. \u00a7800.556. Application for Refund: Issuance New \u00a7800.556 identifies the time period, on or after January 1 and before April 1, for persons to submit applications for the pre- vious calendar year. New \u00a7800.556(b) gives TWC the authority to promulgate the application for the tax refund voucher. New \u00a7800.556(c) limits the use of the tax refund voucher to the year for which the voucher is issued. \u00a7800.557. Limitations. New \u00a7800.557(a) reinforces the requirement of health care coverage for the employee under new \u00a7800.554(3). New \u00a7800.557(b) identifies rules of conveyance, assignment, or transfer of a refund under Chapter 800, Subchapter M. TWC hereby certifies that the adoption has been reviewed by legal counsel and found to be within TWC's legal authority to adopt. PART III.

PURPOSE, BACKGROUND, AND AUTHORITY The purpose of the adopted amendments to Chapter 805 is to add and clarify Adult Education and Literacy (AEL) terms and definitions, clarify professional development requirements and activities that must be provided by AEL programs, and modify an advisory committee term requirement. Further, the General Appropriations Act (Senate Bill (SB) 1, Ar- ticle VII, Texas Workforce Commission, Rider 46, 87th Legisla- ture, Regular Session (2021)) requires TWC to ensure and re- quire that digital skill building is permitted in its programs. Terms and definitions for \"digital literacy skills\" and \"workforce prepa- ration activities\" are adopted to indicate that such activities are expressly allowed under the Workforce Innovation and Opportu- nity Act (WIOA) and to support digital skill building. ADOPTED RULES November 18, 2022 47 TexReg 7749 Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.039 requires that every four years each state agency review and consider for readoption, re- vision, or repeal each rule adopted by that agency. TWC re- viewed the rules in Chapter 805 and determined that the rules are needed, reflect current legal and policy considerations, and reflect current TWC procedures. The reasons for initially adopt- ing the rules continue to exist, and any changes to the rules are described in Part II of this preamble. PART II. EXPLANATION OF INDIVIDUAL PROVISIONS SUBCHAPTER A.
