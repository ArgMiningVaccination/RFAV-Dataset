German, M.D. Vice President for Medical Affairs Dean, College of Medicine Welcome to the University of Central Florida (UCF) College of Medicine. Our faculty, staff and students are working together to make the College of Medicine the nation's premier 21st century college of medicine. The college's strength will always lie in the quality of its students and faculty. Students are working closely with faculty to create the history and founding traditions of our medical school. We are committed to attracting and engaging a diverse group of leaders and scholars who continually strive for excellence. UCF recognizes the aspirations of each student who can design a curriculum around his or her individual interests. The opportunities for personal and intellectual growth are endless. The University of Central Florida is the third largest public university in the United States, having its origin in 1963 as Florida Technological University. With a continuing strong focus on the sciences and technology, UCF provides the perfect environment for an integrated researchbased college of medicine. The College of Medicine educates students to become exemplary physicians, leaders in medicine, scholars in discovery, innovators in technology and compassionate providers of health care for our community. Welcome to the future of medical education. 11 Education that Creates Opportunities UCF is one of the largest and fastest growing metropolitan research universities in the country\u2014and it is located in one of the most dynamic metropolitan areas in the United States\u2014Orlando, Florida. UCF is the university that seeks opportunities, cultivates them and brings them to reality. UCF is a thriving multicampus university. In addition to its physical growth, UCF has become prominent in graduate education nationwide, offering innovative corporate partnerships, worldrenowned faculty and cutting edge research. UCF ranks first among Florida's state universities in total enrollment and ranks third in enrollment in the nation. Current total student enrollment is 56,646. As Central Florida's highereducation partner, UCF plays a major role in the region's fastpaced growth through its community and corporate partnerships; its research programs; and the talents of its 204,444 alumni, 56,646 students and 10,152 faculty and staff. UCF is one of 11 Florida public universities and is located 13 miles east of downtown Orlando. As a metropolitan research university, UCF is committed to innovative community partnerships, worldclass research with local impact and the integration of technology and learning. UCF is classified by the Carnegie Foundation as a comprehensive doctoral institution with high research. With 1,727 faculty members, the university offers 90 bachelor's degrees, 91 master's degrees, three specialist degrees, 29 doctoral degrees and one professional degree program (medicine). Increasing diversity and inclusiveness is one of the central goals of UCF. Minorities account for nearly 20 percent of the faculty and an aggressive minority recruitment plan continues to be a priority for the university. The student community includes Hispanics (14%), Blacks (9%) and Asian/Pacific Islanders (6%) and represents 63 of Florida's 67 counties, all 50 states and 142 countries. This is a particularly strong focus of the College of Medicine, dedicated to graduating physicians of the future from underrepresented populations. One of UCF's main goals is to be America's partnership university. Hundreds of joint projects are in place with community organizations, government agencies at all levels, and corporations\u2014ranging from collaborative research in nanoscience to neighborhood nursing clinics. Major partnerships target two of the region's most prominent business sectors. The Rosen College of Hospitality Management is increasing the university's already significant commitment to the area's tourism and hospitality sector. Hightech interests are wellserved by the Florida High Tech Corridor partnership\u2014an initiative of UCF, the University of South Florida, and the University of Florida that now embraces over 21,400 companies supporting more than 263,000 employees. 12 University of Central Florida Board of Trustees UCF has a governing Board of Trustees composed of 13 members that is the legal body with specific authority over the institution. The board is an active policymaking body for the institution and is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the financial resources of the institution are adequate to provide a sound educational program.

The primary accreditation organization for undergraduate medical education is the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). The LCME (www.lcme.org ) is the nationally recognized accrediting authority for medical education programs leading to the M.D. degree in U.S. and Canadian medical schools. The LCME is jointly sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the American Medical Association (AMA). All state licensing boards in the United States require graduation from an LCME accredited school to be eligible for licensure as an allopathic physician. The LCME has a threestep process for granting accreditation to new medical schools: preliminary accreditation granted prior to recruiting the charter class of students (granted to the UCF College of Medicine on February 5, 2008); provisional accreditation, granted during the second year of operation of the first class; and full accreditation, granted during the fourth year of the first class. The college is developing a curriculum and appropriate standards to achieve full accreditation of the program prior to the graduation of its first class. Other Accreditations All key university health professional programs are currently accredited by the corresponding accrediting organizations. These include: Nursing: Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education Psychology\u2014Human Factors: Accreditation Committee of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Psychology\u2014Clinical Psychology: American Psychological Association Physical Therapy: Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education, American Physical Therapy Association Health Services Administration: Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education Medical Laboratory Sciences: National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences There are also a number of scientific, professional and academic bodies conferring accreditation in specific disciplines.

Examples of conduct for which students may be subject to academic and/or disciplinary penalties including expulsion are: Cheating, whereby nonpermissible written, visual, or oral assistance including that obtained from another student is utilized on examinations, course assignments or projects. The unauthorized possession or use of examination or course related material may also constitute cheating. Plagiarism, whereby another's work is deliberately used or appropriated without any indication of the source, thereby attempting to convey the impression that such work is the student's own. Any student failing to properly credit ideas or materials taken from another has plagiarized. Unauthorized assistance: communication to another through written, visual or oral means. The presentation of material which has not been studied or learned, but rather was obtained solely through someone else's efforts and used as part of an examination, course assignment or project. The unauthorized possession or use of examination or course related material may also constitute cheating. Commercial Use of Academic Material: Selling notes, handouts, etc. without authorization or using them for any commercial purpose without the express written permission of the university and the instructor is a violation of this rule. NOTE: A student who has assisted another in any of the aforementioned breach of standards shall be considered equally culpable. In cases of cheating or plagiarism, the instructor may take appropriate academic action ranging from loss of credit for a specific assignment, examination, or project to removal from the module with a grade of \"F.\" Additionally, the instructor may request disciplinary action through the office of student rights and responsibilities as outlined in the Golden Rule. M.D. students are subject to UCF and College of Medicine policies as reflected in the M.D. Program Student Handbook, including the UCF College of Medicine M.D. Program Honor Code. (See Student Professional Conduct Council, page 50.) Administrative Procedures Act Policy Statement UCF, under applicable rules of the Administrative Procedures Act, may change any of the announcements, information, policies, rules, regulations or procedures set forth in this Bulletin and any of its publications and catalogues. This Bulletin and its contents are subject to change. Classroom Responsibility Students are responsible for maintaining classroom decorum appropriate to the educational environment. When the conduct of a student or group of students varies from acceptable standards and becomes disruptive to normal classroom procedures, the instructor has the authority to remove the 20 offending party from the room and refer the student to the Associate Dean for Students for disciplinary action. M.D. students are held to a much higher standard of professionalism and mutual respect is expected. Complaint Policy UCF supports the right of students to file grievances, lodge complaints and make appeals in a safe environment free of fear, retaliation, or other adverse consequence. The university has a number of offices and committees that are responsible for implementing the institution's established procedures for addressing written academic and nonacademic student complaints. In most cases, the recommended strategy for complaints of any nature is to ask the concerned individual to first contact the person or office most directly connected to the issue, unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. If the concerned individual does not want to contact a faculty or staff member directly, he or she begins with the next highest level of authority, which typically is the department chair or director. If the problem or complaint is unresolved or the individual is not satisfied with the resolution, he or she may file a written grievance or appeal. Specific procedures are included in specific sections of this Bulletin and the Golden Rule. For additional information, please contact the Office of Student Conduct .

Classes include live patient interaction early and often. Innovative simulation and animation experiences have been developed explicitly for the study of medicine that integrate and reinforce the curriculum. From basic science concepts to clinical diagnoses and treatment, the mannequin simulators and online interactive virtual patients enhance and complement learning. The M.D. Program curriculum at UCF fully integrates basic and clinical sciences across all four years. The first two years of the curriculum are structured into modules with the first year focusing on a fundamental understanding of how the various basic science disciplines relate to the normal human body. The second year takes an organ systembased approach and applies the basic knowledge of the first year to the study of clinical disease, pathological processes and treatment. In concert with these aspects of medicine the curriculum presents psychosocial issues, cultural differences, communication skills, and physical diagnosis skills as they relate to the different topics in medicine. Educational experiences throughout the curriculum are designed to enhance the learning environment, emphasize studentcentered learning, application and synthesis of information, and foster an appreciation of lifelong learning. All modalities of learning are incorporated into the curriculum including interactive lectures using audience response systems, simulation, Webbased activities and clinical cases, teambased learning, problembased learning, and standardized patient encounters. Clinical experiences occur throughout the first two years in the Practice of Medicine. Approximately twice a month, students work with community preceptors in a variety of settings, including primary care, specialty practices and hospital based practices. These clinical experiences provide students the opportunity to observe the application of their studies to real patients, as they gain experience in communication, history taking, physical exam skills, and cultural competency. An exciting component of the curriculum at UCF is best described by the Dean as the \"Keep the Dream Alive\" module. This Focused Individual Research Experience (FIRE) module continues throughout the first two years. The scope of these projects is limited only by the student's imagination, and may include every aspect from bench to clinical research, quality of care, hospitality in medicine, quality of life, disease prevention, legal aspects of medicine, and more. Each student works with a mentor to develop an individualized project or area of study that focuses on the student's unique interest and career plan in medicine. 36 The third and fourth years of the curriculum are devoted to clinical experience through clerkships, selectives, and electives. Fundamental knowledge from the first two years is reinforced through lectures, simulations, journal clubs, and conferences during the six core clerkships. Overall, the fouryear medical curriculum at UCF is designed to fully integrate basic sciences and clinical medicine, giving students an appreciation of cultural diversity and the need for sensitivity in treating patients, foster professionalism in all interactions, and ignite a passion for lifelong learning. 37 College of Medicine Facilities at the University of Central Florida Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona Campus at Lake Nona CF nd The College of Medicine medical education building is a multistory facility, approximately 168,000 square feet, located about 20 miles south of UCF's main campus in Orlando.

Composition and Continuity The UCF College of Medicine has an individual SEPC for each cohort of students. The voting members of the committee consist of five core faculty representatives from both the basic sciences and clinical disciplines as appointed by the Dean. The committee also includes the Dean's staff members, Curriculum Directors, Module Directors and Clerkship Directors as described below. The committee follows its cohort or class through each of the four years of medical school (M1, M2, M3 and M4). The committee is identified by the anticipated graduation year of the entering cohort. A class entering in 2010 will be designated the 2014 Class. The intention is that the core faculty members on each committee follow a particular class through the program of study. This provides the committee members greater intraclass continuity and insight into the abilities of the students and also promotes continuity from year one through year four for the class. In addition to the core faculty members, the directors of modules and clerkships in a respective curriculum year are also nonvoting members of the committee for that curriculum year. The Curriculum Directors for years one and two are also nonvoting members of the committee for their respective year. The Dean appoints the committee and the chair from the core faculty. The Assistant Deans for Medical Education and the Registrar support each committee and the Associate Dean for Students also serves on the committee. All are exofficio, nonvoting. The Knowledge Management System also serves as a comprehensive source of continuity. Each Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee is composed of the following: 1. Formal committee members as appointed by the Dean. These committee members follow a single class from year to year until graduation. 2. Dean's staff members, consisting of the Assistant Deans for Medical Education and the Associate Dean for Students, who follow all classes from year to year until graduation. 3. Module Directors, years one and two, Curriculum Directors, years one and two, and Clerkship Directors, years three and four, who serve on each SEPC for the years in which they have responsibility for curricular modules and clerkships. Continuity across the four years for a single class is achieved by the presence of the Dean's staff (Assistant Deans of Medical Education, Associate Dean for Students and COM M.D. Registrar) and SEPC members who are present at every meeting over all four years of a cohort of students (intraclass consistency). Continuity across separate Student Evaluation and Promotion Committees representing different classes (2013, 2014, 2015, etc.) of students (interclass consistency) is achieved by the presence of the Dean's staff (Assistant Deans of Medical Education, Associate Dean for Students, and COM M.D. Registrar), Module Directors, years one and two, Curriculum Directors, years one and two and Clerkship Directors, years three and four, who are present for each yearone class, yeartwo class, yearthree class 48 and yearfour class, respectively. The diagram presented below shows the SEPC composition for four classes over four years. It illustrates both the interclass consistency (SEPC and Dean's Staff) and the intraclass consistency (Dean's Staff, Module Directors, Curriculum Directors, and Clerkship Directors). Composition of Student Evaluation and Promotion Committees (SEPC) Purpose The purpose of each committee is to systematically review the academic progress of each student within that curriculum year. Each committee meets at least twice per year. Additional meetings can be called as required. At each meeting the Module/Clerkship Directors report on the academic progress of the students within their respective modules/clerkships and discuss any shortterm remedial strategies currently being used with specific students. Evaluation Process The SEPC regularly reviews the academic and clinical performance of each medical student. Students are reviewed at each meeting of the committee. In the early to mid part of each instructional module, the Module Director will contact students performing at the C level (or below) in the overall module or a specific subject area to determine whether there is a need for remediation with a tutor or other special 49 help. Students are provided with the appropriate remediation as assessed by the Module Director and the student. The SEPC uses the following process for evaluation and advancement: I. The SEPC shall review the academic and clinical performance of each medical student and make recommendations to the Dean regarding advancement, graduation, probation, dismissal, remediation, leaves of absence, and readmission. II. The committee will review the performance of students in academic difficulty, those students demonstrating a potential for being in academic difficulty, and those students who have exhibited unprofessional behavior or noncompliance with other standards of performance. The committee may recommend an improvement plan, may develop more comprehensive longer term remedial plans for those students having difficulty, or recommend appropriate disciplinary action, possibly including dismissal from the educational program. III. The committee will recognize the achievements of those students displaying exceptional or outstanding performance. IV. The committee chair will notify each student of the committee's recommendation regarding advancement and provide the student with an opportunity to appeal that decision if they desire. V. The Dean makes the final decision regarding an appropriate course of action for each student. Student Professional Conduct Council The Student Professional Conduct Council (SPCC) considers the suitability of students for medical practice due to behavioral, ethical or other reasons. The council performs peer evaluation for issues of student professionalism and other conduct issues that are inconsistent with the values of the College of Medicine. The SPCC strives to educate the students in their professional responsibilities, to investigate any reported violations of the Honor Code, to recommend appropriate penalties, and to interface with the College of Medicine Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC) when breaches of professional conduct are suspected. The SPCC consists of one student representative and one alternate elected from each class. The council is supported by the Associate Dean for Students and chaired by the elected fourthyear student. When a matter is brought to the group, the SPCC and the Associate Dean for Students discuss the merits of the reported violation and must decide whether to hold a hearing within five business days. The hearing shall begin within five days of the notification of the student. When a recommendation for action is made it will be presented to the Associate Dean for Students. The SPCC will prepare periodic reports and recommendations to be submitted to the Associate Dean for Students. Issues pertaining to graduate or undergraduate students within the college will be directed to the appropriate graduate or undergraduate appeals committee. 50 M.D. Program Student Council The M.D. Program Student Council consists of medical students and considers all issues relevant to them. The council makes recommendations to the deans of the college and the faculty when appropriate. The Student Council also organizes social events, professional development activities, student interest groups and other meetings/activities of importance to medical students. Other Committees of the College of Medicine The following committees formulate policies, provide assessment and make recommendations to carry out the mission of the college. Faculty Council The Faculty Council consists of all members of the core faculty of the College of Medicine. The council shall function as a representative body of the faculty (core and noncore) and shall obtain broadly based faculty input regarding affairs of the college. The Faculty Council shall consider any matter brought before it by its members, the faculty, the Medical School Enterprise, or the Dean, find facts relative to such matters and formulate principles and objectives so as to make recommendations or advise the Dean, Medical School Enterprise or other individuals or groups as appropriate. It shall make recommendations to the Dean regarding appointments to standing committees of the College and approve members and chairs of committees of the Faculty Council. The council shall receive reports from the administration, the Medical School Enterprise and the standing committees of the college and shall report regularly to the faculty regarding activities of the administration, the Medical School Enterprise, the Faculty Council, standing committees of the college or other matters deemed appropriate. The council makes recommendations to the Dean of the college, the standing committees and the faculty when appropriate. Promotion and Tenure Committee Faculty members in the College of Medicine are appointed as tenured faculty, tenure track faculty, non tenure track faculty on singleyear or multiyear appointments, affiliated faculty and volunteer faculty. Faculty appointed at Assistant Professor and Associate Professor ranks will be considered for promotion and/or tenure in accordance with university policy. The committee shall be composed of six core faculty members holding the rank of professor. The committee will consist of two subcommittees: one composed of tenured faculty members and the other, faculty members on multiyear appointments. Tenured faculty in the college recommend three of its elected faculty to the Dean for appointment to one subcommittee. Since only tenured faculty may vote on tenure, this subcommittee makes recommendations to the Dean for the award of tenure and promotion of tenure track faculty. Multiyear contract faculty in the college recommend three of its elected faculty to the Dean for appointment to the other subcommittee. This subcommittee makes recommendations to the Dean for the promotion of multiyear contract faculty, and affiliated and volunteer faculty. 51 College of Medicine Student Support Services and Related Policies Office of M.D. Admissions http://www.med.ucf.edu/admissions/ Lake Nona Health Sciences Campus, Suite 115 2661399 Email: mdadmissions@mail.ucf.edu Office Hours: MondayFriday, 8 am - 5 pm (Hours subject to change during holidays and term breaks) Overview The College of Medicine seeks to matriculate students of the highest quality into this very competitive M.D. Program. In addition, UCF College of Medicine encourages applications from a diverse population and values diversity in the medical program. Admissions decisions are made on the basis of a wide variety of information provided in the admissions package of each applicant. The Medical Student Admissions Committee (MSAC) considers factors such as academic qualifications, demonstrated humanism and empathy, research and work experience, teamwork and leadership skills, as well as motivation for medicine. An applicant's character, integrity and general fitness to practice a particular profession may also be considered in the admission process. Admission to the M.D. Program is competitive and although qualified, many applicants will not be invited for an interview. Role of the Admissions Office The College of Medicine M.D. Admissions Office guides students through the medical application and admissions processes. The office develops and implements a College of Medicine recruiting plan that serves to fulfill the mission of the college. The College of Medicine Admissions Office manages the M.D. admissions process for the college. As such, the office is primarily responsible for overseeing the recruitment, application, interview and admissions processes ensuring that they are in compliance with all College of Medicine, UCF, state and American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) governing directives. The Admissions Office works in tandem with the MSAC and other College of Medicine offices to ensure that each matriculated class embodies strength in academics, research, work experiences, professional goals and skills, professionalism and medical motivation that contributes to a diverse, teamoriented, culturally competent classroom. The Admissions Office provides administrative support to the MSAC chair and committee. The Admissions Office uses the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) as the primary application processing system and works with College of Medicine and UCF offices to ensure that supporting data is made available on a timely basis. The College of Medicine Admissions Office both receives and maintains applicant file components in electronic format whenever possible. 52 Applicant Recruiting As the primary recruiting office for applicants to the M.D. Program, the Admissions Office represents the program and uses all means necessary to ensure that viable applicants understand the mission, culture and objectives of the College of Medicine. The Admissions Office participates in as many medical student forums and meetings as deemed appropriate to achieve a diverse, motivated and academically solid student body. The Admissions Office works closely with undergraduate program advisors and special high school advisors to ensure that their students have been prepared properly to begin the medical school application process. This office is also the primary office to provide program advising to applicants to ensure that they understand the application and admissions process. They work with applicants who were not accepted to help them to understand the areas where their application may be strengthened for possible success in a future application year. Finally, the Admissions Office attends AAMC and other meetings deemed necessary to ensure that the office is cognizant of all admissions rules and requirements. International Applicants As a statesupported M.D. Program in Florida with a mission to produce more physicians for the population of the state, only applicants who are U.S. Citizens or who are Permanent Resident Aliens or Asylees with permanent INS documentation in their possession will be allowed to matriculate. Applicant files that are not one of these three groups will not be considered for an interview. Admissions with Advanced Standing (Transfer) The M.D. Program does not plan to accept Advanced Standing (Transfer) applicants for the first several years of the admissions cycle. Application Process The only method by which applicants (excluding transfer applicants) may apply to the UCF M.D. Program is through the online American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). AMCAS is the national application service that processes applications for M.D. Programs throughout the nation. Through AMCAS, an applicant may apply to most M.D. Programs by completing one application document and paying the appropriate fees. AMCAS is considered a service organization to both the student and the school. Although there is an application fee to the student, the institution is not charged for any of the services that AMCAS provides. In addition to processing the application (which includes the verification of all college grades), AMCAS provides the school with current, categorically summarized information regarding all applicants immediately upon completion of AMCAS transcript verification. The AMCAS application period begins in late May and, for most M.D. Programs, terminates on or before December 1st of the year prior to that year in which the applicant anticipates matriculation. The AMCAS application deadline is the date by which the applicant must have their application, all fees and associated data verified by AMCAS. Schools are allowed to make exceptions to the established deadline date for individual applicants when deemed appropriate by the Admissions Office. This institution honors the AMCAS Fee Assistance Program waiver as a basis for waiving the Supplemental Application Fee. 53 The M.D. Program will evaluate completed applications from both residents and nonresidents of the state of Florida. Qualified nonFlorida residents may be invited for an interview. As a statesupported institution, a large majority of each matriculating class will be composed of Florida residents. Required Academic Coursework The College of Medicine has established certain required academic prerequisite coursework for admissions. These requirements must be taken in residence (not online) from a properly accredited college or university in the United States. Applicants must also have completed at least a bachelor's level degree prior to matriculation into the M.D. Program. General Biology 2 Semesters (with labs) General Chemistry 2 Semesters (with labs) Organic Chemistry 2 Semesters (with labs) General Physics 2 Semesters (with labs) College English 2 Semesters College Math 2 Semesters Please note that the College of Medicine does not recommend or encourage an undergraduate college major in any discipline as the \"best\" major for entry to the M.D. Program. Undergraduate majors in either the humanities or sciences are equally acceptable as students are encouraged to follow their own desires when pursuing majors. The College of Medicine recognizes that both the sciences and the humanities are essential to the practice of medicine and encourages studies in that applicant's area of interest. Nonscience majors are encouraged to take as many science courses as possible to assist the MSAC in understanding the applicant's science aptitude. Additional coursework that is recommended, but not required, includes biochemistry (with lab), embryology, cell biology, comparative anatomy and genetics. Coursework in humanities, natural sciences or communication arts is also encouraged. While no specific college math courses are required, some college work in calculus is strongly recommended; familiarity with the principles of statistics for analysis of data is also important. For those applicants who have completed upperlevel degrees, all academics are considered and some of the undergraduate prerequisites may be substituted with upperlevel coursework in the same discipline. Requirements for Interview Consideration In addition to the coursework noted in the preceding section, the College of Medicine expects that each applicant selected for admissions will have demonstrated strong academic skills as well as a motivation for medicine and compassion for others. As such, all applicants invited for an interview should have achieved a minimum of a 3.00 overall and science GPA and have scored a minimum of a 24 on a single MCAT exam which is not older than the last 3 application cycles (i.e. an applicant for the class entering in 54 August 2011 must have taken the MCAT in 20082010). Applicants competitive for an interview should have demonstrated a strong motivation for medicine by having consistently participated in meaningful volunteerism, both in the medical and community service areas. Furthermore, motivated applicants are expected to have participated in some physician shadowing and also have demonstrated teamwork, leadership and preferably basic science lab research skills. State Residency Classification The College of Medicine Office of Admissions for the M.D. Program determines residency for all first timeoncampus medical students; the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office reviews student requests for changes in residency once the student is enrolled. A firsttimeoncampus student will be classified according to the information he or she includes on the application for admission and state residency affidavit, providing that no other information is available that calls into question the information contained on these documents. The M.D. Admissions Office strictly observes the Florida Residency Guidelines, and no exceptions will be made regarding a student's legal state of residence unless it is in accordance with the office of general counsel. The Application File The major portion of the applicant file is maintained electronically in the AMCAS system. AMCAS updates schools with information initiated by the applicant and, using official school transcripts, verifies the academic work of the student. The M.D. Admissions Office collects additional documents submitted on behalf of an applicant and monitors all files until they are complete or until the application deadline has passed. A completed application consists of the following items at a minimum: Verified AMCAS Application Completed Supplemental Application Letters of Recommendation (via AMCAS only) o three Faculty Recommendation Letters OR Preprofessional Committee Letter o two Character Recommendation Letters Application Fee or AMCAS Fee Waiver Designator Passport Type Photo (Requested but not required for completion of file) Official Transcripts (after Acceptance) State Residency Affidavit (after Acceptance) Additional Information Provided by the Applicant (Optional) o Letters providing updated or amplifying information o Recent Grade Sheets/Transcript o U.S. Citizenship Forms o Change of Name Information The M.D. Admissions Office will send an email to each applicant immediately upon file completion and will continue to provide status updates via the Supplemental Applicant dashboard as warranted. It is the responsibility of each applicant to meet established deadlines and to monitor completion of their application. 55 The M.D. Admissions Office maintains the electronic/paper files for all applicants that contain all of the above as well as any other documentation which is pertinent to the applicant for each application year. While in the M.D. Admissions Office, all applicant files are treated as privileged and confidential information. None of the data will be shown to the applicant or any other individual that does not have the need to view the information in the course of their own university business responsibility. Upon the date of matriculation, the M.D. Admissions Office will provide all appropriate documentation to the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar Office which will begin the student educational record that is subject to FERPA Guidelines. Initial Screening of Applicants The initial indication that an applicant has begun the application process is provided by AMCAS. The M.D. Admissions Office communicates with applicants upon receipt of a verified AMCAS application and ensures that qualified applicants receive Supplementary Applications. Once all components of the applicant file have been received, the Director of Admissions for the M.D. Program reviews the file to ensure that the applicant meets, or will meet, all requirements for admission prior to matriculation. Files that meet all requirements are evaluated by being placed in a pool of applicants which may be selected for an interview. Files that do not appear to meet all requirements are reviewed by the Director of M.D. Admissions and the MSAC chair to determine whether to reject the application or allow it to remain in the pool for possible interview selection. The M.D. Admissions Office will release Letters of Rejection to all applicants as sanctioned by the MSAC chair. Interview Selection Guidelines The MSAC chair works in tandem with the Director of Admissions for the M.D. Program to ensure that all applicants chosen for an interview are those who are not only academically talented, but also have demonstrated the desire to pursue medicine. As such, during the rolling admissions process, the Director of Admissions for the M.D. Program constantly reviews the pool of interview ready applications to select the best students available for interview. Those students should have averages which meet or exceed the committee's minimum GPA and MCAT scores. Ideally, those selected for an interview should have: experienced meaningful and consistent medical clinical activities demonstrated consistent service to the community shadowed a physician displayed teamwork and leadership skills participated in basic science research showed perseverance or excelled in an activity (sports, research, etc.) at a very high level Not all applicants selected for an interview will have all of the qualities listed above; however, the Admissions Office seeks to interview applicants who are academically solid, motivated for medicine and bring diversity to the classroom. 56 Interview Day Once an interview group has been created and the applicants have selected an interview date, the Admissions Office provides the applicant with an email confirming the date of interview. This confirmation email provides additional information to include an agenda and information regarding overnight stay, local travel, parking and other details to enhance the applicant's visit. The interview day structure includes a visit of approximately seven hours which includes interviews, program overview, student financial information, a visit to a clinical training site, tour of the medical education building, interaction with current students and administrators, and a discussion regarding the admission and acceptance process. Notification of Acceptance, Rejection or Wait Listing When the MSAC has made a final decision regarding each interviewed applicant, the Director of Admissions for the M.D. program makes immediate contact with each applicant via telephone to inform them of the committee decision. MSAC meetings normally occur within two weeks of the applicant's interview visit. Acceptance Packages Acceptance packages include an Acceptance Letter signed by the MSAC chair. Other items in the package include a copy of the College of Medicine Technical Standards and a Technical Standards Response Form. A written response is desired from the applicant within two weeks of the date of the acceptance letter. The response letter from the applicant should also include the Technical Standards Response Form. If a response letter is not received from the applicant, the Admissions Office will make every effort to contact the applicant to determine their intent. Technical Standards Response Forms are filed with the applicant's response to the acceptance offer in the Admissions File. Those Technical Standards Response Forms which indicate that an accommodation may be necessary are forwarded immediately to the Office of Student Affairs for further action. Official Transcripts All applicants that have been selected for admission to the M.D. Program must provide an official transcript showing a bachelor's degree earned at a regionally accredited U.S. institution to the College of Medicine M.D. Admissions Office prior to matriculation. To be official, transcripts and diploma/degree certificate must bear the original seal or signature of the school's registrar or of the appropriate school official or office. An official transcript bearing the applicant's bachelor's degree must be provided prior to matriculation. Criminal Background Checks Accepted applicants' Criminal Background Checks (CBC) are currently funded by AMCAS. AMCAS initiates the CBC process after January 1st, for all applicants that have been accepted by any AMCAS member institution. As additional institutions offer acceptance to that applicant, they too will be provided access to the result of the original CBC. 57 Office of Registrar/Student Records and Related Policies http://med.ucf.edu/academics/registrar/ Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona, Suite 115 Office Hours: MondayFriday, 8 am - 5 pm (Hours subject to change during holidays and term breaks) Overview The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar manages and maintains the academic records of all medical students. The primary role of the Registrar is to maintain the permanent records and documents pertinent to each matriculated student's progress through medical school. The Registrar is also responsible for maintaining the documents that preserve the institutional memory of the college. The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office provides services to students, faculty, administrators and alumni first among its priorities, recognizing these individuals as the office's primary constituency. As the primary information resource for students and faculty, this office actively seeks to communicate effectively and to inform students about academic policies and procedures, and to provide prompt access to information. The office will continue to seek ways to continuously improve the quality of service provided and to anticipate ways to better meet the changing needs of the College of Medicine community. Registration Before the beginning of the first and second year of classes, medical students are enrolled in all required coursework for the upcoming academic year. For third and fourthyear students, it is important for students to consult with the College of Medicine Office of Student Affairs and their faculty advisor to gain advice on the courses or clerkships that they may want to enroll in, consistent with their career goals. For additional information regarding registration, please visit the College of Medicine Office of Student Affairs webpage at http://www.med.ucf.edu/ . Registration is the process by which students are enrolled in classes. Students may view their schedule by using the Student Self Service web site at https://my.ucf.edu . Enrollment Certifications/Letters of Good Standing UCF has outsourced these services to the National Student Clearinghouse. Students may obtain their enrollment verification online at https://my.ucf.edu . Enrollment certification is free to currently enrolled students. Letters of \"good standing\" are provided upon written authorization from the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office. Parents, employers, background checking firms and other third party agencies may request enrollment and degree verifications online at www.enrollmentverify.org . A fee will be assessed for all such requests. UCF has contracted with National Student Clearinghouse to provide current enrollment, degree and past 58 attendance verifications online 24 hours a day, seven days a week at www.enrollmentverify.org or available at 7037424200 between 9:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. ET Monday through Thursday, and 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Friday. Withdrawal Policy Withdrawal for each term begins after the \"tenth day of enrollment.\" Students may withdraw from a module and receive the notation of \"W\" with the approval of the Office of Student Affairs of the College of Medicine. Withdrawing from classes may have financial aid consequences. Students should seek appropriate advisement prior to withdrawing. A student is not automatically withdrawn from a module for not attending, nor can an instructor withdraw a student from a module. Upon request the instructor will provide the student with an assessment of the student's performance in the module prior to the last permitted day of withdrawal. No withdrawal is permitted after the deadline except in extraordinary circumstances such as serious medical problems. Unsatisfactory academic performance is not an acceptable reason for withdrawal after the deadline. Students who are seeking to petition for a late withdrawal should consult with the College of Medicine's Office of Student Affairs. At the time of the request, the Office of Student Affairs will ascertain from the instructor whether the student was passing or failing the module. If the student was passing, a \"WP\" will be recorded on the student's permanent record; if failing, a \"WF\" will be entered. Medical and late withdrawals normally are granted for all modules being taken at the time of withdrawal. Students who seek late withdrawal because they are ill must apply for the withdrawal within six months of the term from which the withdrawal is sought. Students seeking a late withdrawal because of medical conditions must follow the medical withdrawal procedure. The student's physician provides the university with the appropriate medical information, using the forms available in the College of Medicine Office of Student Affairs. If a medical withdrawal is approved, a \"W\" will be recorded for each module that the student was enrolled in. Students who receive a medical withdrawal may be placed on hold until the college can determine that the student is ready to return. If a medical withdrawal is not approved, the request may be approved as a late withdrawal and grades of \"W\" will be recorded. Following the close of the tenth date of enrollment for each term, students withdrawing from modules will incur both grade and fee liability. Students with circumstances determined by the university to be exceptional and beyond their control may apply for a cancellation of enrollment and the elimination of fee liability. Exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to, sickness, death, involuntary call to military service, or administrative errors created by the college or university. Students must submit a 59 petition and all supporting documentation for a late drop of modules to the College of Medicine Office of Student Affairs within six months of the end of the semester for which the late drop is sought. If a student withdraws from a module while an alleged academically dishonest act is under consideration and the case is not subsequently resolved in favor of the student, the college reserves the right to assign the appropriate grade for the module. Holds A hold (negative service indicator) may be placed on a student's records, transcripts, grades, diplomas or registration due to financial or other obligations to the university. Satisfaction and clearance of the hold is required before a release can be given. Students may check for holds at https://my.ucf.edu . To obtain an immediate release for a financial hold, payment to the UCF Main Campus Cashier's Office must be made either in cash, credit card, cashier's check or money order. Records The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar is responsible for maintaining permanent records and documents that pertain to each matriculated student's progress through medical school. These records include application materials, medical school evaluations, official transcripts of all medical school coursework, documentation of grade changes, USMLE scores and USMLE ID number, official dates of enrollment, Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE), documentation of dismissal or withdrawal, copy of diploma, copy of Federation of State Medical Boards and other state licensing forms. The procedures used in managing these records are consistent with established standards and existing regulations. As a student, the educational records are considered confidential. Under most circumstances an individual student's records will not be released without the student's written and signed consent. Student records are maintained electronically within a secure infrastructure. The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar provides access to student records to faculty and administrative staff with a legitimate educational interest. Students have the right, under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), to inspect and review their educational records. Student records submitted to the university become the property of the university and cannot be returned to or copied for the student or released to a third party. Student records are digitally scanned. Students may request to amend their records under the provisions outlined in the regulation. Challenges to medical student academic records will follow the appeal process included in the university's Golden Rule to be adapted for the College of Medicine. 60 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The procedures for protecting the confidentiality of student records are based on state regulations and the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). FERPA affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. They are: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days (State of Florida law = 30 days) of the day the university receives a written request for access. Students should submit to the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar written requests that identify the record(s) they desire to inspect. The university official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the university official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed; 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate. Students may ask the university to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate. They should write the university official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate. If the university decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the university will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing; 3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the university in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the university has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility; and 4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by a state university to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA are: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington DC, 202024605 61 Directory Info Under the provisions of the FERPA, students have the right to withhold the release of the following items designated by UCF as \"Directory Information:\" name current mailing address telephone number date of birth major field of study dates of attendance enrollment status degrees and awards received participation in officially registered activities and sports athletes' height and weight Unless otherwise indicated, these informational items may be released at the discretion of the university. The university will honor a student's request to withhold \"Directory Information\" until such time as that student's request to withhold \"Directory Information\" is rescinded. Until such rescindment is affected, the university will continue to withhold such information, even after enrollment has terminated. For more information, please refer to the Student Rights to Privacy (FERPA) . Higher Education Act Lists, descriptions and sources of information required for disclosure under the Higher Education Act may be obtained from the UCF registrar's office (Millican Hall 161) or from the UCF registrar's website http://registrar.sdes.ucf.edu/hea/ . Name Changes To change the legal name maintained on the student's official UCF record, the student must submit a completed \"Change of Name\" form and supporting documentation to the appropriate UCF office. A copy of a legal name change document (e.g., marriage certificate, divorce decree, etc.) must be attached to the form. Students must submit the form to the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office. The \"Change of Name\" form is available from the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office website http://www.med.ucf.edu/academics/registrar/forms.asp . Address and E\u00admail Changes To communicate in a more expedient manner, UCF uses email as the primary means of notifying students of important university business and information dealing with registration, deadlines, financial assistance, scholarships, tuition and fees, etc. The College of Medicine sends all businessrelated and academic messages to a student's Knights email address to ensure that there is one repository for that information. It is critical that students maintain and regularly check their Knights email account for official announcements and notifications. Communications sent to the Knights email address on record 62 will be deemed adequate notice for all university communication, including issues related to academics, finances, registration, parking, and all other matters. The university does not accept responsibility if official communication is rejected or fails to reach a student who has not registered for, or maintained and checked on a regular basis, their Knights email account. Students must ensure that permanent and mailing (local) addresses and telephone numbers are current with the university at all times. Students can update their contact information online at https://my.ucf.edu . Transcript Requests Official UCF transcripts are requested using the new online ordering process. All currently enrolled students have access via the student portal at: https://my.ucf.edu . Telephone and email requests are not accepted. Transcripts cannot be released if the student has a hold due to a financial obligation to the university. Transcript requests must include the student's signature, full name, identification number and the name and complete address of the person(s) or organizations to which transcripts are to be sent. If final grades or degree statement are needed, a student may indicate that the transcript request is to be held until all requested data are posted. Official transcript costs for the M.D. program have been assessed as part of yearly fees; consequently, transcripts are provided to enrolled students at no charge. However, the transcript cost for other UCF undergraduate and graduate programs is $10 per copy effective January 1, 2008. There is a transcript fee of $10 per transcript for requests made following graduation or withdrawal from the program. Full\u00adtime Enrollment Requirements All students enrolled in the M.D. Program must attend fulltime and take the educational modules as a cohort group. Exceptions to these enrollment requirements are granted only in cases of documented medical hardship. Requests for an exception should be directed to the College of Medicine Associate Dean for Students in writing. Registration in Term of Graduation A student must be registered in a term in which the College of Medicine faculty or administrative and professional time are required (e.g., for review of thesis or research report by faculty or editorial staff, for completion of internships, or for comprehensive or other examinations). Each student is reviewed during the fourth year by the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC) to determine the student's suitability for graduation. In conducting that review, the committee examines the student's performance in the preclerkship educational program, clinical performance in the clerkships, and professionalism exhibited throughout the program of study and during the capstone experience. In addition, the committee verifies that all required examinations have been completed. All students must take the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and pass at the national standard in order to graduate. This examination is usually taken by all students in April 63 following the secondyear studies. In addition, all students must take the USMLE Step 2 CK and Step 2 CS examinations in order to be certified for graduation. Students should take the Step 2 CK and the Step 2 CS examinations no later than December 31 prior to their year of graduation. Certification of Degree Completion The College of Medicine certifies that all program and college requirements have been met. Degree certification forms are prepared in the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office and forwarded to the SEPC (M4) for final determination that all requirements for the M.D. degree have been met. Medical students who have completed all the requirements for the degree and have successfully completed the required clerkships may request a letter to that effect prior to the receipt of the degree. Such letters will be issued by the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office. Grade System The college uses a letter system for the M.D. Program where grades are assigned for overall performance in a given module or clerkship. Students' performance in academic course work are evaluated by assignment of grades of (A) Excellent Performance, (B) Good Performance, (C) Conditional Performance, in order of excellence. The (F) grade (Unacceptable Performance) is given to students who fail a module/clerkship, who demonstrate inappropriate professional behaviors, or who fail to attend or participate in required course activities. Other grade actions include an (I) showing incomplete work, a (W) indicating that a student withdrew from the course, an (R*) followed by a grade showing that the student repeated the course (Grade Forgiveness), and a (T) used as a \"temporary grade\" for performance pending review by the SEPC. The (T) is used when a student has an overall passing grade but may require further study to strengthen their fund of knowledge in one or more subject areas in a module. The (T) grade is replaced when remediation is accomplished. Faculty may specify that some programs (selectives/electives) can be graded using a (P) pass/ (F) fail grade designation. All grade options for the program are subject to approval by the M.D. Program Curriculum Committee. The instructor assigns an I (incomplete grade) when a student is unable to complete a module or clerkship due to extenuating circumstances, and when all requirements can clearly be completed in a short time following the close of regular classes. In all circumstances where a student receives an (I), the student and faculty member must complete an agreement that specifies how and when the incomplete grade will be made up, which will be considered by the appropriate SEPC. All students receiving financial assistance (federal and institutional loans), will be cautioned that the terms of the assistance require that the (I) grade must be made up by the agreement date. Minimal competency in each module/clerkship is a composite score of 70 or above (A, B or C grade). A (T) entry identifies students whose performance, although within the passing range, requires study and reevaluation in one or more areas within the module/clerkship. A (T) is used as a \"temporary grade\" for module/clerkship grades when students have achieved an overall score that would indicate a passing grade, but they have shown weak or marginal performance in one or more of the traditional subject areas that are included in the overall module/clerkship. The overall performance of students 64 receiving a (T) in lieu of a grade is reviewed by the SEPC with the Module/Clerkship Director to determine how the student may improve their fund of knowledge in the identified subject area(s). The (T) grade is replaced by the final module/clerkship grade when remediation is successfully accomplished in knowledge, skills, attitudes and/or behavior. Individual Module or Clerkship Directors specify how performance on assigned work is related to this grading scale in the particular module or clerkship. The final grade assigned for the module is recorded on the official transcript. However, because the preclerkship modules are integrated or organ system based but involve a number of traditional basic science disciplines, Module Directors will also record performance in those areas as well. Where appropriate, the Module Director will assign a (T) grade to indicate that the student's performance in one or more discipline areas falls in the conditional or unacceptable range. Similarly, Clerkship Directors may assign a (T) grade to indicate that a particular student's knowledge, skill or professionalism is conditional or unacceptable in a particular area, even though the student's overall performance is excellent or good. Assigned (T) grades with annotations are used by the SEPC in its review of an individual student. A student may appeal his or her exam or course grade if he or she feels that the grade was assigned in a manner not in accordance with the module or clerkship statement of policy distributed at the beginning of the module or clerkship. This is not a process for appeal of established module or clerkship grading policies. The appeal is directed initially to the Module or Clerkship Director and then to the Assistant Dean of Medical Education for resolution at an informal level. If resolution of the issue is not made to the student's satisfaction, then a formal appeal is made in writing to the Office of Faculty and Academic Affairs stating the reasons for the appeal. After an appropriate hearing and review, the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs will recommend final disposition of the appeal. A student wishing to appeal to the Dean concerning the recommendation must make a written request within 10 school days of receipt of written notification of the recommendation from the Office of Faculty and Academic Affairs. Acting as the University President's representative, the Dean of the College of Medicine shall make a final decision on the matter within 10 school days of receipt of the student's request for review. Medical students are assigned a personal portal on the MyUCF web site where final grades, notices and announcements are posted. In addition, each medical student receives a secured portal into a personal web site using MEDS (Medical Education Delivery System) where instructional module notices, assignments and grades from formative assessments are posted. Summative final grades are submitted electronically by the Module Directors through a secure web site to the College of Medicine M.D. 65 Registrar who reviews the grades and forwards them to the university registrar for final posting on https://myUCF.edu . Incomplete Grades The instructor assigns an I (incomplete grade) when a student is unable to complete a module or clerkship due to extenuating circumstances, and when all requirements can clearly be completed in a short time following the close of regular classes. In all circumstances where a student receives an (I), the student and faculty member must complete an agreement that specifies how and when the incomplete grade will be made up, which will be considered by the appropriate SEPC. All students receiving financial assistance (federal and institutional loans), will be cautioned that the terms of the assistance require that the (I) grade must be made up by the agreement date. Minimal competency in each module/clerkship is a composite score of 70 or above (A, B or C grade). Classification of Modules/Courses 60006999 Advanced graduate level modules. These modules are designed to build upon the beginning graduate level courses/modules and to deliver more advanced content and experiences. 70007999 Doctoral level courses . These courses provide material at the most advanced graduate level. Florida's Statewide Module/Course Numbering System Modules/courses in this Bulletin are identified by prefixes and numbers that were assigned by Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS). This numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institutions in Florida and by thirtythree nonpublic institutions. Students and administrators can use the online Statewide Course Numbering System to obtain course descriptions. The information is at the SCNS website: http://scns.fldoe.org . Validity of Submitted Documents If the college finds that an applicant has made a false or fraudulent statement or a deliberate omission on the application, residency affidavit, health report, or any accompanying document or statement, that applicant will be denied admission. If the student is enrolled when such fraud is discovered, the student is immediately withdrawn (with no refund), denied further enrollment and invalidated on credit and any degree based on such credit. Actions for this type of offense are handled administratively by the Office of Student Affairs after notification to the alleged violator and hearing by that office. Leave of Absence Students who are unable to continue enrollment, complete required modules or clerkships due to illness, maternity leave of absence, hardship or special circumstances must immediately contact the College of Medicine Office of Student Affairs. The student requesting a leave of absence must submit a letter outlining the reasons for the request and timetable for return to the Associate Dean for Students and the Chair of the SEPC for the appropriate class. 66 The Associate Dean for Students in conjunction with the SEPC may approve a shortterm leave of absence. Any incomplete work must be completed by the time specified in the letter to the student sent by the Associate Dean for Students or the Chair of the SEPC. Leave of absence may be granted for up to one calendar year. Leaves requested for a longer period are approved only in exceptional circumstances. Extension requests must be made to the SEPC before the expiration of the original Leave of Absence. Note: for purposes of deferring repayment of student loans during a schoolapproved leave of absence, federal regulations limit the leave to six months. The M.D. Program at the College of Medicine does not permit auditing of modules. Modules are only available to students enrolled in the M.D. Program. Residency Reclassification The College of Medicine Office of Admissions for the M.D. Program determines residency for tuition purposes for all newly admitted students at the College of Medicine. Thereafter, the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office reviews requests for changes in residency. To request a residency review, the student must submit a completed \"Residency Reclassification Request Form\" and supporting documents to the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office. This form is available either at the UCF registrar's office or online at http://registrar.ucf.edu/ . The reclassification form must be accompanied by all documents that support the student's Florida residency claim. Residency reclassification requests are subject to Florida Statute 1009.21 (formerly 240.1201), Florida State Board of Education Administrative Code 6A10.44 and State Board of Education rule 6C7.005. In addition, university policy requires students requesting residency reclassification to provide documentation establishing that they have income or personal resources to meet financial obligations of attendance and living expenses. Contact the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office for additional information regarding all residency reclassification requirements. When building a case for Florida residency for tuition purposes, the student may choose to submit documents from a variety of categories. Students may consult the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office before submitting the reclassification request and supporting documents. The submission of documents in itself does not qualify the student for Florida residency for tuition purposes. The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office will evaluate the submitted documents and available information and will render an eligibility determination. UCF is authorized to make discretionary judgments as to residency within the bounds of the law and in reaching this professional judgment will evaluate all documents submitted and information available. No single document shall be conclusive. Students seeking residency reclassification should understand that living in or attending college in Florida is not tantamount to establishing residency in Florida for tuition purposes. The student who comes to Florida to enroll in a Florida postsecondary educational institution as an outofstate resident and continuously enrolls in a Florida institution normally will not meet the Florida residency 67 requirement for instate tuition regardless of the length of time enrolled. Living or attending school in Florida merely evidences physical presence. The student must provide documentation verifying that he or she has formed significant legal ties to the state of Florida. This documentation must establish that the Florida residence constitutes a bona fide domicile rather than serving the purpose of maintaining a mere temporary residence or abode incident to enrollment in an institution of higher education. Evidence establishing legal ties to states other than Florida may disqualify the student from Florida residency for tuition purposes. All determinative documents must be dated at least 12 months before the first day of class for the term in which residency is sought. New and continuing students who believe that they qualify for Florida residency must submit the request and all documents prior to end of \"Late Registration\" for the term in which Florida residency is requested. Documentation received after the last day of \"Late Registration\" will not be used to determine residency for the current term. Approved residency reclassification will not be applied retroactively to previous terms. The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office may require additional documentation beyond that initially submitted by the student or the claimant before it can render a reclassification eligibility determination and it will not complete its review of the residency reclassification application until both the student and the claimant have submitted all requested documents. Office of Student Financial Services and Related Policies http://med.ucf.edu/students/financial/ Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona, Suite 115 Office: 2661381 Office Hours: MondayFriday, 8 am - 5 pm (Hours subject to change during holidays and term breaks) Overview The College of Medicine Office of Student Financial Services makes every effort to assist students in securing adequate funding for their educational expenses. A major function of the office is to assist with the financial aid application and disbursement process, as well as provide financial counseling on topics such as debt management and budgeting. The Office of Student Financial Services conducts group presentations and workshops and accepts individual appointments to discuss and counsel students on their individual situation and needs. It is recommended that all students read the Student Financial Services Guidebook which lists steps to take to apply for, as well as policies in place regarding, financial aid. 68 Tuition and Fees Information about tuition and fees can be obtained from the College of Medicine Office of Student Financial Services, or the College of Medicine Office of M.D. Admissions, located on the first floor of the Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona (or by visiting http://med.ucf.edu/students/financial/tuition.asp ). Fee Invoices and Due Dates Students can view their fee invoices by visiting https://my.ucf.edu . Please note that students will not have an invoice until they are registered for courses. Fall payment (50 percent of annual total) is due on the first day of orientation Spring payment/Second payment (remaining 50 percent of annual total) is due on the first day of class in January. Deferrals of Tuition and Fees Financial aid awards will normally result in a deferment of tuition and fee payments. Deferments allow for the time lag that normally occurs between the date that tuition and fees are due and the date on which financial aid disbursements are made and enrollment can be verified (add/drop date), which is normally two to three weeks after the term begins. Students are responsible to pay any amount owed to the university that is not covered by estimated aid and/or other resources by the payment deadline. The deferment process occurs automatically if the student is meeting all general eligibility requirements and has enrolled full time in the M.D. Program. Students should refer to correspondence from the Office of Student Financial Services, contact the Director of Student Financial Services, or utilize https://my.ucf.edu to obtain uptodate information. Since awards are subject to change, deferments are also subject to change. Deferments based on estimated Stafford loans will be canceled prior to the beginning of the term if the student has not completed the loan application process. Students should communicate with administrators if enrollment plans or financial plans change during the course of their attendance. Student Financial Responsibility Statement/Late Payment Fee Registration at the College of Medicine requires students to acknowledge the following financial responsibility statement: \"I accept responsibility for payment of my term tuition and fees by the published deadline. I understand that if I do not pay my tuition and fees by the due date, I will be charged a $100 Late Payment Fee, my records will be put on hold, my account will be referred to a collection agency and I may incur other financial consequences.\" Past Due Accounts All financial obligations to the university must be met. Failure to meet obligations can result in the withholding and denial of registration, diploma, transcripts and readmission to the university. The services of a professional collection agency and recourse to the courts may also be invoked if deemed necessary. All costs of collection, including attorney's fees, are borne by the debtor. Students should not 69 assume registration will be canceled for failure to pay fees or attend classes. Tuition deferrals, for example, will prevent class cancellation for nonpayment. Fee Appeals Students who desire to appeal a late registration fee and/or a late payment fee may make their appeal to the Fee Appeals Committee by initiating a student petition (Form 41561). This form can be obtained online at www.fa.ucf.edu (Click Forms, Student Services and Fee Appeals Petition). Students must submit their petitions to the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's Office or College of Medicine Office of Student Affairs and may appear before the Committee (not mandatory). Forms faxed to College of Medicine Office of Student Affairs should be addressed Attn: Fee Appeals (407) 2661389. Holds Holds due to unpaid tuition and fees that prevent registration and the receipt of transcripts will automatically be removed overnight once fees are paid. Financial Aid Disbursements/Short Term Advances Financial aid disbursements begin the second week of each payment period. Students should be aware of this, so they are prepared to use their personal savings for anticipated expenses such as books and supplies at the beginning of each term. A Short Term Advance may be available for students to help with these expenses, but funds are limited and should not be relied upon. The application is available for download prior to each payment period, so that funds may be available as early as two weeks before classes start. Students who apply late for financial aid should be prepared to cover their own educational and living expenses well into the enrollment period. When financial aid disburses, the funds first apply towards university debts. The remaining balance is refunded to the student in one of two ways: via direct deposit or paper check. If a student has provided his or her bank information to set up direct deposit, which can be done on https://my.ucf.edu , then the refund is deposited into the student's account. Otherwise, a check is mailed to the student's current mailing address on https://my.ucf.edu . Paper checks take longer to process and there will be at least a threeday delay. Direct Deposit of Refunds Students are strongly encouraged to establish direct deposit with the university. Direct deposit prevents delays due to lost checks or change of address. All refunds from students' accounts can be directly deposited into their checking accounts. Funds are usually available within 2448 hours after disbursement and enrollment only takes a few minutes. To enroll, sign in at https://my.ucf.edu and click on Student Self Service. Click on the Student Accounts icon and then click on Direct Deposit and follow the instructions. Please note that efficient budgeting practices need to be implemented by students receiving refunds that cover their living expenses. Whether the refund is from loan proceeds or scholarship funding, it is important that students practice smart spending techniques. For further information, please contact the Office of Student Financial Services at 4072661381 or 4072661383. 70 Payment Procedures If financial assistance will not cover the full balance due on a student's account then proper payment procedures must be followed. Payment must be received or postmarked no later than the fee payment deadlines specified to be considered on time. Noncash payments (checks and money orders) placed in the 24Hour Depository (at the main campus) by the official fee payment deadline will be considered on time. Acceptable forms of payment include cash, checks or credit cards. There are several ways to pay: Pay Online - the most convenient, especially for UCF Medical students : Credit card and check payments may be made online, through MyUCF EPay (https://my.ucf.edu/ ).

Pay by Mail: Check or Money order: Do not send cash. Please include the student's Social Security Number or PID (Personal Identification Number) on checks or money orders. For mailing address, click on the link: www.fa.ucf.edu/cashier/cashier.cfm (COM Finance Office) 24Hour Depository Location: Students may pay by cash, check, money order or credit card at the locations listed. Please put Social Security Number or PID (Personal Identification Number) on check or money order. o Main Campus, MH 110\u2014(407) 8232614 o Main Campus, John T. Washington Center\u2014(407) 8230829 Refund of Fees Withdrawal or dismissal from the College of Medicine by the end of the week indicated will result in a full or partial refund as indicated below. Please note that this refers to classes, not orientation. Refunds for withdrawals or dismissals apply only to the portion of the year for which payment has been made. The date of withdrawal is determined by the date that document of withdrawal is received by the Associate Dean for Students. The College of Medicine uses the university schedule for refunds. The schedule is as follows: end of first week - one hundred percent end of second week - seventyfive percent end of third week - fifty percent end of fourth week - twentyfive percent fifth week or later - no refund In the case of a medical withdrawal associated with a medical condition that prevents the completion of studies, a full refund of tuition and fees may be approved by the Associate Dean for Students. Refunds for medical withdrawals apply only to the portion of the year for which payment has been made. Consideration will be given for a medical withdrawal only when an illness or injury makes it impossible to complete a term. A medical withdrawal normally requires withdrawal from all instructional activities. 71 Medical withdrawals will not be approved if the difficulty resulting from an injury or illness was present when the student enrolled for the term. A refund of fees will be processed under the conditions noted. The student must submit a written appeal for a refund or other appeal action to the Associate Dean for Students within six months of the close of the year to which the refund or other appeal action is applicable. Any debts to the university will be deducted from the refund, up to the full amount. The refund amount depends upon eligibility as described below: A refund of fees will be processed automatically based on the date of receipt of the documentation of withdrawal by the Associate Dean for Students. Any outstanding debts owed to the university and the College of Medicine will be deducted from the refund, up to the full amount. Refunds for exceptional circumstances are determined by the college and are available up to 100 percent of tuition and registration fees. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, sickness, death, involuntary call to military service or administrative error. Refunds for students receiving federal financial aid must adhere to the Return of Title IV Funds Policy noted. Refunds for students receiving university sponsored aid such as scholarships and grants are subject to the same refund policy. Therefore, if a student is subject to a percent refund of tuition due to early withdrawal, the same percent of gift aid will be refunded to the university. This includes institutional scholarships that cover living expenses. The earlier noted calculation will be performed within 30 days after notification of withdrawal or within 30 days after the university becomes aware of the withdrawal. Return of Title IV Funds Students who withdraw after having received Title IV financial assistance might have to repay a portion of that assistance. If the student's award package includes any federal funds and the withdrawal occurs in the first 60 percent of the payment period, federal regulations require that a portion of the student's federal aid be returned to the aid programs. The portion of the aid to be returned is determined by a refund calculation which is based on the number of days remaining in the period. The return of aid is credited in the following order: Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan Federal GradPLUS Loan Other Aid Students who received Federal Stafford Loans should also know that the College of Medicine Office of Student Financial Services is required to notify the Department of Education of student withdrawals. 72 Approved Leaves of Absence A student who is on an approved leave of absence may retain \"ininstitution\" status for Title IV loan repayment purposes. However, if the student does not return from a leave of absence, the student's loan grace period starts at the date the leave began. Moreover, Title IV regulations limit leaves of absence to 180 calendar days for recipients of federal funding. If the student has not completed the course work from the term in which the leave of absence was taken or is not reenrolled at the end of 180 calendar days, the leave of absence is treated as a withdrawal for federal financial aid purposes. Student Eligibility for Federal Funds To receive aid from most federal financial aid programs, students must meet certain requirements and complete a FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) every year. A student's citizenship status must fall into one of the following categories to receive federal student aid from the U.S. government: U.S. Citizen U.S. National (includes natives of American Samoa or Swain's Island) U.S. Permanent Resident who has an I151, I551, or I551C (Alien Registration Card) Foreign National holding an ArrivalDeparture Record (I94) from the Department of Homeland Security showing one of the following designations: o \"Refugee\" o \"CubanHaitian Entrant\" (valid only if issued before April 1, 1980) Other eligible noncitizens with a Temporary Resident Card (I688) Foreign national with a suspension of deportation case pending before Congress. If an applicant has only a Notice of Approval to Apply for Permanent Residence (I171 or I464A) he or she is not eligible for federal student aid. Financial Aid Application Process Financial aid is awarded on an annual basis. Standard requirements for students who are applying for ALL types of financial aid are as follows: Complete and accepted Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA ) for upcoming academic year. All aid applicants who are U.S. citizens and permanent residents must complete this form online at www.fafsa.ed.gov . Applicants must be sure to list UCF's school code: 003954. Additional documentation as requested on a case by case basis. Additional documents SHOULD NOT BE SUBMITTED UNLESS specifically requested by the Office of Student Financial Services. These items may include: \u0083 A signed copy of the student's previous year's tax return and W2 Forms; \u0083 Federal Verification Worksheets; \u0083 Other necessary documents to complete the verification process. 73 Please note that any special circumstances the applicant or their family may be experiencing should be noted by completing the Professional Judgment Appeal Form at http://med.ucf.edu/students/financia l/documents/prof_judgment_appeal.pdf . Supporting documentation should be provided along with the form. Once the processed FAFSA is received by the College of Medicine (and once the student is admitted into the M.D. Program), the student will receive an email or written letter requesting any outstanding documents that may be needed to complete their file application. Students may also view their \"to do\" list by visiting the student portal at https://my.ucf.edu . Specific Eligibility Requirements and Conditions for Receiving Financial Aid Students must be accepted into the M.D. degree program and be enrolled as a fulltime student. (The M.D. Program does not have a parttime program.) Students must maintain College of Medicine's Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress . Students are required to inform the Office of Student Financial Services of any additional sources of aid they expect to receive beyond those listed on the award notification. Any subsequent awards or resources may necessitate a revision of the financial aid award(s). This includes, but is not limited to, any private scholarships or third party tuition payments, departmental payments or waivers. Students may not receive aid in excess of their cost of attendance. Students must not be in default on any federal educational loan or owe repayment on a federal grant at this or any other institution. Students must provide all information requested for the completion of their file. If selected, verification must be completed within specified deadlines and prior to the receipt of all federal and most state and institutional funds. Students must notify the College of Medicine Office of Student Financial Services of any changes in their housing status, household size, or family members in college from that listed on their processed FAFSA . Students must reapply annually for needbased financial aid. Students must be a U.S. citizen or an eligible noncitizen (e.g. resident alien). Eligible noncitizens include I151, I551 and I688 cardholders as well as some I94 classifications. For need based programs, students must show a financial need as determined by the FAFSA . Helpful Hints Students should apply early to be considered for the full range of financial aid available each year by completing the FAFSA (or renewal FAFSA). The processed results of the FAFSA should be received by UCF from the federal processor by March 1 to meet the application priority deadline date. Make a copy of tax return forms before submission to IRS. Start a folder to save financial aid information and photocopies of all documents filed and received. Include student's name and PID on all documents submitted. (Do not submit originals; documents may be shredded after scanning.) 74 Maintain an up to date and accurate mailing address on https://my.ucf.edu . Complete all items, even if it doesn't seem advantageous at the time. Respond promptly to all information requests. If students have any questions or concerns, they should call the College of Medicine Office of Student Financial Services. Determining Financial Need All awards are made on the basis of calculated financial need. Financial need is determined by subtracting the estimated available resources of the applicant (as determined by a standard need analysis formula) from the estimated cost of attendance for the student. The cost of attendance/budget estimates are published by the Office of Student Financial Services every fall with the actual figures published in the spring. Financial Need Formula Cost of Attendance (COA) - Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as derived by the FAFSA = Financial Need Need Analysis The information provided on the FAFSA is evaluated by the federal government using its Federal Methodology need analysis formula. This formula determines the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) that is used in the financial need formula above. The Student Budget/Cost of Attendance (COA) The most up to date COA figures can be found on http://med.ucf.edu/students/financial/cost.asp . Purpose and Design Student Cost of Attendance (COA) budgets are developed each academic year by the Office of Student Financial Services and are dependent on tuition and fee structures set by the governing boards. Therefore, the COA may be estimated during the early awarding process and is subject to change. The COA, minus EFC, is used in the evaluation of financial need (COAEFC=NEED). The COA or student budget has two primary purposes: 1. To give students an estimate of reasonable costs to attend the College of Medicine. 2. To establish the federally required uniform COA standard against which to measure financial need. Living expense items in student budgets are modest and require students to carefully plan their expenditures. While the published budget offers a suggested breakdown for housing, food, transportation and personal expenses, students are free to exercise flexibility within these lineitems to accommodate personal preferences as long as the total spending does not exceed the total living expense budget. The use of good judgment is necessary. Standard student budgets are based on typical expenses for a single student. Costs for the student's spouse/children are not included in the standard student budget; these expenses are accounted for in the need analysis formula when determining the expected student/spouse contribution. 75 Student's Rights Regarding Financial Aid Federal regulations state that the student has a right to know: What financial aid programs are available. The deadlines for submitting applications for each of the financial aid programs available. How financial aid is distributed. How the student's financial need was determined. How much of the determined financial need has been met. An explanation of the various programs in the student's aid package. The college's tuition refund policy in case the student withdraws. What portion of the financial aid is a loan and must be repaid and what portion is nonrepayable grant/scholarship aid. For loans awarded, what the interest rate is, the total amount that must be repaid, the repayment procedures, the length of time to repay the loan and when the repayment is due to begin. How the college determines satisfactory academic progress and the consequences if such progress is not met. That they have a right to appeal decisions made by the Office of Student Financial Services. That although each student's case is analyzed individually, eligibility standards are applied uniformly without regard to race, gender, creed, national origin, physical handicap, or sexual orientation. That all documents submitted to the Office of Student Financial Services are confidential. Student's Responsibilities Similarly, the student's responsibilities are to: Read the information that the college is required to provide about policies. Complete all required documents accurately and submit them before the deadlines to the proper places. Provide correct information. In most instances, misrepresentation of information on financial aid application forms is a violation of law and may be considered a criminal offense that could result in indictment under the U.S. Criminal Code. Misrepresentation may also result in disciplinary action by the College of Medicine. Supply all additional documentation, verification, corrections and/or new information requested by the Office of Student Financial Services or the agency to which the application is submitted. Read and keep copies of all forms requiring signature. Be aware of the terms of the assistance programs awarded. Accept responsibility for all signed agreements including the repayment of loans according to the stated terms. Notify the Office of Student Financial Services promptly and in writing of any changes in financial circumstances that occur after submission of the aid application. 76 Notify the Office of Student Financial Services promptly and in writing of any change in academic status from that of being a fulltime medical student in good academic standing. Be aware of the college's refund procedures. Fraud If the College has reason to suspect that a financial aid applicant may have deliberately misrepresented information in connection with his or her aid application, the college may initiate disciplinary action. In the case of fraud or other criminal misconduct, referral may be made to the U.S. Department of Education's office of Inspector General, or if more appropriate, to a state or local authority. If evidence of misconduct is documented, the college will review the matter to determine if the student should be sanctioned or dismissed. U.S. Income Tax Liability Any source of funding that is contingent upon performing some kind of work or service is considered taxable income regardless of whether it is used to pay tuition. Students who receive scholarships, grants, fellowships or other forms of gift assistance in excess of the cost of tuition, mandatory fees, books and equipment should be aware that the excess amounts are subject to taxation under current federal law. The fact that such income is not reported on a W2 form does not mean that these funds are not taxable. Further information is available from the IRS (www.irs.ustreas.gov ), as well as from most tax preparers. Credit Report If a student has established credit with anyone (student loans, credit cards, auto loans, etc.) they should check their credit report in order to ensure accuracy. A credit check is currently done for students applying for Alternative and GradPLUS Loan Programs. Reviewing their credit history now could save a student time and energy at a later date. Students are entitled to one free credit report per year and they may request a copy of their credit report by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/ or going directly to the web sites of any of the following credit bureaus: TRANS UNION CORP: http://www.transunion.com/ EXPERIAN: http://www.experian.com/ EQUIFAX: http://www.equifax.com/ Please note: The College of Medicine cannot be responsible for funding any student who has a loan application denied due to a negative credit report. Satisfactory Academic Progress Federal regulations require the university to establish Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) as a general eligibility requirement for financial aid. A student must maintain satisfactory academic progress in their medical studies regardless of whether the student previously received financial aid. To meet the standards adopted by UCF, a student must: Demonstrate that all competencies have been met in all requirements for the year. 77 Be certified by the Office of Student Affairs of the College of Medicine as having made satisfactory academic progress. Standards of Progress for Veteran Students \u00adM.D. Program 1. Unsatisfactory Performance As defined in the Academic Policies section of the M.D. Program Student Handbook, students with unsatisfactory performance will be subject to dismissal from the College of Medicine. 2. Academic Probation As defined in the Academic Policies section of the M.D. Program Student Handbook, students are subject to dismissal from the College of Medicine if they do not achieve academic good standing under established rules. VA benefits will be terminated for VA students for failure to achieve academic good standing and dismissal after probation. 3. Dismissal (Veteran Benefits) As defined in the Academic Policies section of the M.D. Program Student Handbook, benefits may be terminated for VA students who are dismissed from the College of Medicine. For more specific information regarding financial aid and financial services, please refer to the Student Financial Services Guidebook. Other College of Medicine Policies, Requirements and Information Students are subject to all policies of the university as delineated in the UCF Golden Rule. M.D. students are also subject to all policies and procedures outlined in the M.D. Student Handbook and the College of Medicine M.D. Bulletin. Absences/Attendance Students are expected to attend all scheduled hours of instruction. Mandatory session and participation requirements in modules and clerkships and remediation due to absence are determined by the Module/Clerkship Directors. The student will be held responsible for any material covered during the excused absence, but will be permitted a reasonable amount of time to complete any missed work. Recognizing that situations arise which require students to miss time from their module/clerkship responsibilities, the procedures presented below will be followed when absence is necessary: Emergencies - Personal Illness, Family Illness, etc. Year 1 and Year 2 Modules If a student must miss a scheduled exam or mandatory module requirement due to personal or family illness or emergency, the student must contact the Office of Student Affairs to report his or her absenteeism on the first day of being absent. The student should indicate the nature of the emergency. The Office of Student Affairs will take whatever action is necessary and will notify the Module Director 78 of the student's absence. If possible the student should contact the Module Director as well. Upon return the student absence form must be completed by the student. Year 3 Clerkships The College of Medicine recognizes the primacy of the Core Clerkships as critical components of medical students' education. The following policy is intended to address the amount of time that students can miss from their Clerkship for approved circumstances. The goal is to ensure that students obtain he objectives of the curriculum. sufficient experience to meet t Clerkship Attendance Policy 1. On a sixweek clerkship, students are allowed to miss three full days of responsibilities as excused absences for the following: o Illness o Family emergencies o Presentation at professional meetings 2. Absences due to illness or family emergencies should be reported to the appropriate Clerkship or Site Director and supervising physician/chief resident on service. Approval for student presentations at professional meetings must be requested in advance (refer to College of Medicine M.D. Program Student Handbook). Such absences must also be reported in writing to the Clerkship Coordinator for documentation purposes. Once approved, you must inform your supervising physician/chief resident of your absence. The student absence form must be completed and forwarded to the Office of Student Affairs by the Clerkship Directors. The student will contact the resident or attending physician if no resident is on the service and the Clerkship Director to report his or her absenteeism on the first day of being absent. He or she should indicate the nature of the emergency. It will be the prerogative of the Clerkship Director, following consultation with the student, to excuse the absence. 3. Absences exceeding three days will require makeup, the nature of which will be determined by the Clerkship Director. Examples include the taking of additional call or weekend shift. 4. The three days of excused absences do not include, for example, vacation or social events. 5. Any questions or problems during the clerkship should be addressed with the Clerkship or Site Director. Year 4 Senior Required and Elective Rotations The student contacts the individual faculty member or resident responsible for the elective, to report their absenteeism on the first day of being absent. The faculty member may excuse the absence. The student absence form must be completed by the faculty member and student and forwarded to the Office of Student Affairs. 79 Scheduled Time Off (e.g. conflicts, out of town meetings, personal requests, etc.) All modules/clerkships: Students must submit a written request (student absence form ) to the Module/Clerkship Director for permission to miss scheduled exams, module/clerkship projects, or mandatory sessions. The request should be submitted well in advance of the scheduled event. The decision to grant or deny the request and determine subsequent action will be at the discretion of the Module/Clerkship Director. It is the responsibility of the student to advise the Module/Clerkship Director if they are experiencing academic difficulties. Consideration will be given for activities such as elected student representation to various committees, organizations, and personal requests. The Module/Clerkship Director will respond to the student's request in writing with a copy to the Office of Student Affairs. The student must provide any documentation requested to the Office of Student Affairs addressing absenteeism. Students who miss scheduled hours are expected to acquire the same level of competency as other students involved in the module/clerkship. Religious Observances It is the policy of UCF to reasonably accommodate the religious observances, practices and beliefs of individuals in regard to admissions, class attendance and the scheduling of examinations and work assignments. A student who desires to observe a religious holy day of his or her religious faith will notify all of his or her instructors and will be excused from classes to observe the religious holy day. The student will be held responsible for any material covered during the excused absence, but will be permitted a reasonable amount of time to complete any missed work. Where practicable, major examinations, major assignments and university ceremonies will not be scheduled on a major religious holy day. Students who are absent from academic or social activities because of religious observances will not be penalized. A student who believes that he or she has been unreasonably denied an educational benefit due to his or her religious belief or practices may seek redress under the Student Grievance Procedure, located in the Golden Rule. Academic Policies Evaluation Policy Pre\u00adclerkship Evaluation Methods Formative methods of evaluation are incorporated throughout each module of study using multiple assessment approaches appropriate to the module. Examinations are given at periodic intervals during the preclerkship basic science portion of the curriculum. In addition, in certain modules a more comprehensive evaluation is conducted at the mid term of each module with a comprehensive summative evaluation conducted at the completion of each module. The content and time of each 80 examination is established by the Module Directors and coordinated by the Assistant Deans of Medical Education. The questions are generally multiple choice and computer graded, but may include other formats. It is the responsibility of each Module Director to establish the criteria for the awarding of module grades, the format of the examination, the role of examinations and other graded work in the determination of the grades, and the communication of this information to students on the first day of each module. Any concerns relative to individual examination questions, criteria for module evaluation or final grades should be directed to the appropriate Module Director. Written examinations account for a major portion of the grade in most modules, but other evaluation methods including laboratories, small group and teambased learning activities and projects will also be utilized and may influence the final grade in each module. Students are expected to take examinations as scheduled. Students unable to take an examination as scheduled because of an emergency situation (e.g., hospitalization or death in the family) must notify the Office of Student Affairs and the Module Director prior to the examination. Where applicable the summative evaluation may include \"shelf exams\" of the national board exam. Student performance on both the formative and summative evaluations are presented to the students as completed and it is the responsibility of each Module Director to monitor the progress of the students through that module and implement immediate, shortterm remedial strategies for individual students within that module timeframe, if needed. The results are also reported to the appropriate SEPC at each of their meetings (described on page 48) where more formal, comprehensive and longer term remediation plans may be developed for those students showing minimal academic progress within that curriculum year. Clinical Evaluation Methods Student evaluation in the clerkship portion of the curriculum includes written examinations, as well as other forms of evaluation. The format of clerkship examinations may include multiple choice exams obtained from the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME), Objective Structured Clinical Exams (OSCE), simulation exams, or other formats. Some clerkships use oral examinations administered by faculty, or faculty and house staff together. In addition, attending faculty and house staff evaluate clinical performance. It is the responsibility of each Clerkship Director to establish the criteria for the awarding of clerkship grades, and to communicate these criteria to students on the first day of the clerkship. Examples of these evaluation areas include: Knowledge of information Interest in learning Historytaking and physical examination skills Technical skills Organization of data/formulation of hypotheses Ability to relate to patients Professionalism Cultural competency 81 Student performance data for years one through four are captured and maintained in the Online Grading System managed by the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office, inclusive of both formative and summative results. Students are provided access through a secure website to review their performance record. Module and clinical evaluation reports are generated from data captured in the Online Grading System. The evaluation reports become the permanent academic record of each student and are maintained in the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's Office within an electronically secured infrastructure of the UCF. Students are expected to take examinations as scheduled. Concerns affecting individual examination questions or other forms of evaluation, as well as final grades, must be directed to the appropriate Clerkship Director, within ten school days of receipt/notification of the final clerkship grade. Evaluation of students in the selectives and electives may or may not include a written examination. The evaluation method is established by the Clerkship Director and is provided to the student on the first day of the rotation. Appeal of Grades A student may appeal his or her final grade if he or she feels that the grade was assigned inappropriately and not in accordance with the module or clerkship statement of policy distributed at the beginning of the program. The appeal is directed initially to the module or Clerkship Director; and then to the Assistant Dean of Medical Education for resolution at an informal level. If resolution of the issue is not made to the student's satisfaction, then a formal appeal is made in writing to the Office of Faculty and Academic Affairs. After an appropriate hearing and review, the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs recommends final disposition of the appeal. A student wishing to appeal to the Dean concerning the recommendation must make a written request within five (5) working days of receipt of written notification of the recommendation from the Office of Academic and Faculty Affairs. Acting as the university president's representative, the Dean of the College of Medicine shall make a final decision on the matter within 10 school days of receipt of the student's request for review. Student Professional Conduct Council Students are subject to the rules and regulations of the College of Medicine's Student Handbook. The Student Professional Conduct Council has as its duties the consideration of students where suitability for the practice of medicine needs to be evaluated (further details can be found on page 50). In granting the M.D. degree, the faculty of the college endorses each student as being suitable for the practice of medicine. Students, where their suitability for practice is questioned due to behavioral, ethical, or other reasons, will be reviewed by the council. The council realizes that some behaviors may call for accommodation as a disability. The process used and the rights of students in this process are outlined below: The student shall be notified by SPCC of the decision to hold a hearing within 48 hours of the decision. The student has the right to request excuse from any tests, assignments, or examinations from 48 hours before the start of the hearing to 48 hours after the SPCC has made their decision. 82 At the sole discretion of the Dean, the student may be removed from all clinical and classroom work during the preliminary and formal proceedings if it is determined that the student poses a threat to patients, students, faculty, or other personnel associated with the COM. The student has the right to present witnesses during the hearing. The student has a right to an expedited resolution of the charges; every effort must be made to resolve matters quickly. The student shall be given reasonable and adequate time for preparation of defense. The student will be given copies of all written evidence three business days before starting the Honor Code Hearing. The student has the right to confront his or her accusers and to crossexamine all witnesses who appear at the hearing. The student has a right to decline discussing any and all aspect of the charges. This decision shall in no way be considered admission of guilt. The student has a right when found not responsible to request that this finding be made public. The student may not graduate until the case and all appeals have been resolved. Attorneys are not permitted to represent the student. The student does have a right to be accompanied by a faculty advisor chosen by the student that will only assist in an advisory role. Grading Policy See page 64 of this Bulletin for detailed information on the grade system. Medical Student Advancement More detailed information on medical student advancement can be found under the \"Advancement of Students\" section in the M.D. Program Student Handbook. Advancement Process The Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC) regularly reviews the academic and clinical performance of each medical student. Students are reviewed at each meeting of the committee. In the early to mid part of each instructional module, the Module Director will contact students performing at the C level (or below) in the overall module or a specific subject area to determine whether there is a need for remediation with a tutor or other special help. Students are provided with the appropriate remediation as assessed by the Module Director and the student. The SEPC uses the following process for evaluation and advancement: I. The SEPC shall review the academic and clinical performance of each medical student and make recommendations to the Dean regarding advancement, graduation, probation, dismissal, remediation, leaves of absence, and readmission. II. The committee will review the performance of students in academic difficulty, those students demonstrating a potential for being in academic difficulty, and those students who have exhibited unprofessional behavior or noncompliance with other standards of performance. The committee may recommend an improvement plan, may develop more comprehensive longer 83 term remedial plans for those students having difficulty, or recommend appropriate disciplinary action, possibly including dismissal from the educational program. III. The committee will recognize the achievements of those students displaying exceptional or outstanding performance. IV. The committee chair will notify each student of the committee's recommendation regarding advancement and provide the student with an opportunity to appeal that decision if they desire. V. The Dean makes the final decision regarding an appropriate course of action for each student. For more information on SEPC, please turn to page 48. Annual Evaluation Each student is reviewed annually by the SEPC to determine the student's preparedness for advancement to the next level of medical study. Students receiving all A and B grades for all modules or clerkships in a given year are normally advanced to the next year of study or recommended for graduation. Students with one or more C grades or T grades are reviewed by the committee to determine appropriate followup or action which could include no additional requirements, completion of a particular course or examination, requirement to retake a particular module/clerkship, repeat a complete year, dismissal from the program, or other requirements. The student may also be placed in a probationary status until required actions are completed. Students with one or more F grades will be reviewed separately by the committee to determine their suitability for continuing in the program. The committee may recommend remedial action requiring the student to retake a module/clerkship, repeat a year, other requirements, or may recommend dismissal from the program. Appeal of Advancement Recommendation A student may appeal the advancement recommendation by the SEPC if the student feels that that the recommendation decision was not made in accordance with the advancement policy specified for the program. The student may be advised by the Associate Dean for Students and College of Medicine M.D. Registrar regarding official policies. The written request for an appeal is directed initially to the chair of the SEPC for resolution by the committee. If resolution of the issue is not made to the student's satisfaction, then a formal appeal is made in writing to the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs within 10 school days after receiving notification of the SEPC decision regarding the appeal. After an appropriate hearing and review, the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs will recommend final disposition of the appeal. A student wishing to appeal to the Dean concerning the recommendation must make a written request within 10 school days of receipt of written notification of 84 the recommendation from the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs. Acting as the university president's representative, the Dean of the College of Medicine shall make a final decision on the matter within 10 school days of receipt of the student's written request for review. In the event student progression is delayed, a student will be assigned to the present or adjusted year SEPC as is deemed appropriate by the present SEPC. Medical Student Final Evaluation Graduation Each student is reviewed during the fourth year by the SEPC to determine the student's suitability for graduation. In conducting that review, the committee examines the student's performance in the pre clerkship basic science areas, clinical performance in the clerkships, and professionalism exhibited throughout the program of study and during the capstone experience. In addition, the committee verifies that any required examinations have been completed. Further information on gr Required Examinations aduation requirements can be found on page 122 of this Bulletin. All students must take the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), Step 1 and pass at the national standard in order to graduate. This examination is usually taken by all students in April following the secondyear studies. In addition, all students must take the USMLE Step 2 CK (Clinical Knowledge) and Step 2 CS (Clinical Skills) examinations in order to be certified for graduation. Students should take the Step 2 CK and the Step 2 CS examinations no later than December 31 in the fourth year. Technical Standards for Medical School Admission, Academic Progression and Graduation The M.D. Program educates physicians who are capable of entering residency training (graduate medical education) and meet all requirements for medical licensure. All candidates are evaluated according to the same standards and criteria. Delineation of technical standards is required for the accreditation of U.S. medical schools by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). The technical standards describe the essential abilities required of all candidates. Reasonable accommodation in achievement of the standards is defined under federal statutes applied to individuals with disabilities. Such accommodations are intended to support the successful completion of all components of the M.D. degree. The technical standards for the M.D. degree are applied in concert with other policies of the university, including academic policies, academic standards established by the faculty, and student conduct policies. 85 Standards in five areas must be met by all candidates: Observation, Communication, Motor Function, Cognitive, and Professional. 1. Observation Candidates are reasonably expected to observe demonstrations and participate in experiments in the basic sciences; observe patients at a distance and close at hand; demonstrate sufficient use of the senses of vision and hearing and the somatic sensation necessary to perform a physical examination; and integrate findings based on these observations and to develop an appropriate diagnostic and treatment plan. 2. Communication Candidates are reasonably expected to communicate in verbal and written form with health care professionals and patients, including eliciting a complete medical history and recording information regarding patients' conditions; perceive relevant non verbal communications such as changes in mood, activity, and posture as part of a physical examination of a patient; establish therapeutic relationships with patients; and demonstrate reading skills at a level sufficient to individually accomplish curricular requirements and provide clinical care for patients using written information. Accommodation through use of a trained intermediary or other communications aide may be appropriate when this intermediary functions as an information conduit. 3. Motor Function Candidates' motor and sensory functions must be sufficient to diagnose and deliver effective patient care by consistently, quickly, and accurately integrating all data gathered through whatever sense(s) employed. Candidates are reasonably expected to perform physical examinations and diagnostic procedures, using such techniques as palpation, auscultation, and percussion; complete routine invasive procedures as part of training, using universal precautions without substantial risk of infection to patients; perform basic laboratory tests and evaluate routine diagnostic tools such as EKGs and Xrays; respond in emergency situations to provide the level of care reasonably required of physicians; and participate effectively in physically taxing duties over long hours and complete timed demonstrations of skills. 4. Cognitive Standards Candidates must have sufficient cognitive abilities and effective learning techniques to assimilate the detailed and complex information presented in the medical curriculum. They are reasonably expected to: measure, calculate, analyze, synthesize, extrapolate, and reach diagnostic and therapeutic judgments; recognize and draw conclusions about threedimensional 86 spatial relationships and logical sequential relationships among events; formulate and test hypotheses that enable effective and timely problemsolving in diagnosis and treatment of patients in a variety of clinical modalities; understand the legal and ethical aspects of the practice of medicine; and remain fully alert and attentive at all times in clinical settings. Problemsolving, the critical skill demanded by physicians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. 5. Professionalism Candidates are expected to demonstrate behavior and social attributes that enable the effective practice of medicine. Candidates are reasonably expected to demonstrate the judgment and emotional stability required for full use of their intellectual abilities; possess the perseverance, diligence, and consistency to complete the medical college curriculum and prepare to enter the independent practice of medicine; exercise good judgment in the diagnosis and treatment of patients; complete all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients within established timelines; function within both the law and ethical standards of the medical profession; work effectively and professionally as part of the health care team; relate to patients, their families, and health care personnel in a sensitive and professional manner; participate effectively in physically taxing duties over long work hours, function effectively under stress, and display flexibility and adaptability to changing and uncertain environments; maintain regular, reliable, and punctual attendance for classes and clinical responsibilities; contribute to collaborative, constructive learning environments, accept constructive feedback from others, and respond with appropriate modification. Compassion, integrity, interpersonal skills, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admission and educational processes. All candidates are responsible for meeting acceptable standards for behavior and intellectual functioning. Only minimal accommodation is foreseen with regard to the professional section of the technical standards. Campus Security Security at the UCF Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona has several components. Student spaces, teaching facilities, and much of the administrative space is secured by cardaccess entry. Cameras are located throughout the facilities and are recorded. The exterior of the campus includes strategically placed emergency blue light telephones that provide a handsfree speakerphone link to the local first responder. The campus is patrolled 24 hours a day by the University of Central Florida Campus Police with additional patrols provided by the Orlando Police Department and the Orange County Sheriff's Office, all of which are agencies fully accredited by the Commission for Florida Law Enforcement Accreditation, Inc. 87 The UCF Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona is located in the City of Orlando and emergency responders are located nearby the campus. The security presence uses a combination of vehicular and foot patrols. Additional security coverage is provided during preparation time for exams, and escort services are available to assist anyone on campus during the evening and weekend who need an escort to their vehicle by calling the UCF Police Department at (407) 8235555. The University of Central Florida Office of Emergency Management (UCF OEM) prepares the University for responding, recovering from, and mitigating against any natural or manmade disaster and/or crisis. Information on emergency preparedness can be found at http://emergency.ucf.edu/about.html or by calling (407) 8236300. Counseling Center Counseling services on the UCF Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona include two onsite licensed mental health practitioners, one who will be available on Tuesdays from 1:30 to 6:30 p.m. and the other on Thursdays from 12 to 5 p.m. These individuals, in addition to personal counseling, are charged with the development of specific outreach and consultation offerings for UCF medical students to enhance their adjustment and wellbeing. The practitioners report directly to the UCF counseling center director. Counseling services are also available to medical students at the Counseling Center on the UCF Orlando campus. In situations where referral is indicated or desired by students, the Counseling Center staff will provide referrals to community agencies or private practitioners as needed. In response to specific needs of medical students and their adjustment to medical school, specific outreach programming will be offered in the areas of stress management, time management, self care and adjustment to a demanding schedule. When counseling services are closed and there is an emergency, students are encouraged to call 911 or the UCF Police Department at 4078235555. After hours, students may also contact Lifeline of Central Florida at 4074252624 for assistance in a crisis. UCF Counseling staff members are available on an asneeded basis for consultation with UCF College of Medicine administrators, faculty and staff related to overall student wellbeing and developmental support. Health professionals at UCF Counseling and UCF Health Services are not part of the evaluation system for student progress in medical school. Furthermore, staff in the respective programs maintain the strictest rules of confidentiality. Students are given the names of other agencies and other health professionals not affiliated with the College of Medicine or UCF should they wish to seek other assistance. Although the Office of Student Affairs staff members serve as advisors to medical students, they do not act as counselors; they serve as liaisons to the Orlando campus and the community and provide referral services to students as appropriate. 88 Dress Code M.D. students, at all levels of education and training, are expected to maintain a proper professional image in their behavior and personal appearance at all times. During the preclinical years medical students are expected to wear clean, appropriate apparel (shirts, pants, shorts, dresses, skirts, etc.), shoes, and the UCF COM ID badge to all academic functions and on the premises of the College of Medicine. During the clinical training years, and any time students are in the Clinical Skills and Simulation Center (CSSC), have contact with patients, or are in patient care areas, the following dress code is in effect: Dress Code for Patient Care and Clinical Activities Students must maintain an appearance that conveys a professional image and is suitable for duties in all patient care areas including patient encounters in the CSSC, the ambulatory setting and hospital wards. Acceptable requirements for appearance include the following: a) Photo identification badge must be worn at all times when engaged in College of Medicine sanctioned activities off campus, as appropriate. b) White lab coats when required for an activity should be clean, wrinkle free and in good repair. c) Professional clothing: Pressed slacks or skirt as appropriate for gender. Neat, clean shirt or top. a. Men should wear dress shirts or polo shirts with collar. Ties are optional but are recommended for patient care. b. For women, low cut, midriff, strapless or seethrough blouses, shirts or dresses are not acceptable. Undergarments should not be visible. c. Tshirts with slogans or pictures are not allowed. d. Jeans, shorts, miniskirts and athletic shoes are not considered professional clothing. e. Shoes should be clean with heels no greater than 2 inches. d) Jewelry selection: Two earrings per ear maximum may be worn and must be appropriate for patient care areas. Other than earrings, no visible piercings are allowed. Bangle bracelets are not recommended. e) Makeup should project a professional image. f) Hair must be clean and styled in such a manner as to prevent inadvertent contamination during patient care and other professional duties. Unusual and unprofessional hair styles or color are not allowed. Long hair should be controlled in the back and unable to fall forward during activities. Facial hair must be neatly groomed or cleanshaven. g) Headgear that is not worn for religious purposes is not allowed. h) Fingernails should be clean and maintained at a reasonable length of \u00bc\" or less. Acrylic nails are not allowed. i) Body art/tattoos should not be visible. j) For patient comfort purposes excessive perfumes, colognes, aftershaves, scented lotions etc. should not be worn in patient care settings. k) Gum chewing or use of any tobacco products is not allowed in clinical settings. Enrollment Policy Students enrolled in the College of Medicine are not permitted to enroll in courses or degree programs in any other school/college of the university or in any other institution of learning without the consent of the Dean of the College of Medicine. Request to enroll in dual degree programs are handled on an individual basis and may be permitted with approval of the committee overseeing each program 89 involved. Maintenance in that program related to academic performance may be reviewed as appropriate by the SEPC. Requests should be initiated through the Associate Dean for Students for advice and administrative assistance and support. Employment Policy No student may accept outside employment of any kind without prior approval of the Associate Dean for Students. This rule is in place so that outside activities do not interfere with academic performance. Exposure to Infectious Diseases and Environmental Hazards Educational sessions are conducted on prevention of exposure to infectious diseases and environmental hazards at matriculation orientation and at the beginning of each academic year. Prior to the initiation of clinical experiences, medical students receive specific training on use of personal protective equipment including appropriate fit testing of N95 masks. At matriculation/orientation all students receive verbal and written protocols and procedure for care and treatment should exposure occur. Should an exposure occur students should immediately report exposure to any potentially infectious material (blood, open wounds, etc.) to their clinical instructor or appropriate agency. When an HIV infected individual comes to the attention of the university, whether student, faculty, or staff member, confidentiality of the individual as well as the individual's welfare and that of the university community must be respected. Other infectious diseases will be handled appropriately and reported according to State requirements. Immediate procedure: Remove bloodborne pathogen. Sharps exposure - wash with soap and water. Students SHOULD NOT squeeze the affected area. Mucous membrane exposure - flush with copious amounts of water. Report exposure to immediate supervisor. Report within 12 hours of exposure to: o Hospital setting during regular business hours Contact clerkship, module, elective or selective director. Inform resident or attending physician. Report to Employee Health, Occupational Health or Infectious Disease in the hospital. Designations and follow up of exposures may be handled by different departments in affiliated facilities. In some cases, emergency room physicians may handle exposures. The director of nursing services or nursing supervisor on duty may be the first line of contact. o Hospital setting during nonregular hours and holidays Report exposure to resident and attending physician follow their advice on obtaining treatment. Seek assistance from clinic or facility emergency room physicians if resident and attending physician are not immediately available. 90 The director of nursing services on duty may be the first line of contact during non regular hours. o Other setting during regular and nonregular business hours and holidays: If HIV status of source is unknown, whenever possible rapid HIV testing will be performed on source. If exposure occurs during Health Services hours of operation and source HIV status is unknown, student will call Health Services 4078230260 to speak with the medical director or his or her designee. If exposure occurs after Health Service hours of operation, or source is known HIV positive, student will proceed to nearest hospital emergency department for evaluation and treatment as deemed necessary. The student's clinical instructor and the student will report the exposure to the College of Medicine. The incident, including the names of all contact points, will be documented by the Office of Student Affairs. All exposures will be reported to the Office of Student Affairs of the College of Medicine and to UCF Health Services. The Associate Dean for Students will provide assistance should the student encounter difficulties and in informing and coordination of followup care with UCF Health Services. Assistance in obtaining evaluation, prophylaxis and followup care can be obtained through the Office of Student Affairs for the College of Medicine and UCF Health Services. Code names are used for all laboratory testing performed through UCF Health Services to assure confidentiality. UCF Health Services maintains a strict policy regarding confidentiality and requirements concerning protected health information. The student assumes responsibility for all charges associated with diagnosis and treatment. If exposure results in contraction of disease or disability, the student will be allowed to continue in the program to the extent that he or she does not pose a risk to self or others. Prophylaxis for Hepatitis B may be indicated, dependent on the status of the patient, the exposure and immunity of the student. When an exposed student is known to be immune to Hepatitis B, no prophylaxis or testing of the patient is needed. If a student is unsure of his or her status, laboratory testing can be performed to assess both the patient and student's status. If the student is not immune and the patient is positive for Hepatitis B, then the student should receive immune globulin and Hepatitis B vaccine series. Followup testing should be performed at six months to verify the student's Hepatitis B status. When HIV postexposure prophylaxis is indicated the most current antiretroviral medication(s) as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will be employed. Students who opt to use antiretroviral therapy will be followed at UCF Health Services for the appropriate duration of therapy. Followup HIV studies will be recommended at six weeks, 12 weeks, six months and 12 months, or according to current CDC guidelines. 91 Source patients should also be tested for Hepatitis C. Exposed students should receive followup testing for this virus as outlined by the CDC. Faculty Advising Students receive academic advisement and career counseling from three sources over the course of their medical education: a faculty advisor, a specialty advisor, and the Office of Student Affairs. The faculty advisor is primarily responsible for academic advising, and the specialty advisor is primarily responsible for career counseling and academic advising relevant to the clerkship years. The Office of Student Affairs, under the direction of the Associate Dean for Students, has overall responsibility for the advising and counseling system. This includes providing faculty development to the faculty and specialty advisors, developing an overarching advising and career counseling program, and advising the student body both as a group and individually as needed. All students are assigned a faculty advisor. The faculty advisor, who must be a core faculty member with the College of Medicine, is responsible for academic advising, professionalism, career counseling, and providing guidance when appropriate for personal matters. Students are asked to meet with their assigned faculty advisors at recommended intervals and more often as needed or desired. Ideally, the assigned faculty advisor stays with a particular student throughout the preclerkship years of the M.D. Program. If there are circumstances which preclude a successful continued advisoradvisee relationship, then the Office of Student Affairs (through the Associate Dean for Students) makes arrangements for an alternate advisor to be assigned. Faculty serving on the SEPC for a particular academic year who are also serving as advisors for students within that academic year must recuse themselves from any SEPC business relating to those students. In addition to having individual meetings with the faculty advisor, the Office of Student Affairs coordinates small group sessions for students with their faculty advisors. In these sessions, students are paired with other students and their advisor to form several small groups. These meetings occur approximately twice per year in small group sessions focusing on professionalism, humanism, career planning or other issues of importance to students. Students are encouraged to take an active role in the development, planning, and execution of these small group sessions, as well as the advising program as a whole. Beginning in the third year, students are asked to choose one specialty advisor (or more, if appropriate) to provide specialtyspecific guidance and assistance with applying to residency, as well as advisement in selecting electives. Ideally the specialty advisor writes one of the student's letters of recommendation, provides assistance and feedback with the residency application (personal statement, CV, ERAS application, etc.), and discusses a variety of residency programs around the country with the student. The Office of Student Affairs also provides substantial support for students during elective planning and the residency application process. 92 Finally, the Office of Student Affairs also holds regular meetings with students throughout the year to discuss issues of particular relevance to their phase of education. For example, at the beginning of the M1 year, this session may focus on stress management, time management, and study skills. Special sessions are held by the Office of Student Affairs timed to coincide with critical events in the students' careers, such as preparation for the USMLE, orientation to the M3 year, choosing electives and planning for the M4 year, and application to residency. The Office of Student Affairs also works with students to develop and support specialtyinterest groups, residency fairs, and workshops providing guidance to students on career choice and planning. Advisor Assignments (Faculty) a. Role of the Faculty Advisor Essentially, the role of the advisor is to serve as an advocate for the student. Ideally, the relationship develops into one in which the advisor is sought out by his or her advisee for counseling, friendship and advocacy. He or she becomes a trusted confidential guide. Although the frequency of contact depends largely upon the advisee, it is appropriate for the advisor to become proactive in the relationship and initiate dialogue. For example, the advisor can offer guidance in such matters as surviving in medical school, geographic location, personal problems, and referral to other resources as necessary. Issuing caveats in certain areas is also within the realm of advisement. Being accessible to the student is important; therefore, advisors are encouraged to maintain opendoor policies. b. Role of the Specialty Advisor The specialty advisor counsels the student in choosing and progressing toward a career, developing a senior year program which is in concert with the student's career goals, and assisting in the process of applying for residencies. Changes or adjustments to the senior year schedule must be approved by the specialty advisor and the Associate Dean for Students. c. Access to Student Records and Grades Guidelines of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), also known as the Buckley Amendment, are followed in managing student records and grades. The personal records and grades of a student on file in the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's Office and Office of Student Affairs are accessible for review by the assigned faculty and specialty advisors. It is the responsibility of the advisor to ensure confidentiality of all student records reviewed. d. Changing Advisors If for any reason a student wishes to change advisors or mentors, or vice versa, the Office of Student Affairs will affect the desired change upon request and provide appropriate notifications to the advisor and/or the student. Faculty/Medical Learner Compact (Adapted Directly from the AAMC) Preparation for a career in medicine demands the acquisition of a large fund of knowledge and a host of special skills. It also demands the strengthening of those virtues that undergird the doctor/patient 93 relationship and that sustain the profession of medicine as a moral enterprise. This Compact serves both as a pledge and as a reminder to teachers and learners that their conduct in fulfilling their mutual obligations is the medium through which the profession inculcates its ethical values. 1. Guiding Principles DUTY Medical educators have a duty, not only to convey the knowledge and skills required for delivering the profession's contemporary standard of care, but also to inculcate the values and attitudes required for preserving the medical profession's social contract across generations. INTEGRITY The learning environments conducive to conveying professional values must be suffused with integrity. Students learn enduring lessons of professionalism by observing and emulating role models who epitomize authentic professional values and attitudes. RESPECT Fundamental to the ethic of medicine is respect for every individual. Mutual respect between staff, patients and learners, as novice members of the medical profession, and their teachers, as experienced and esteemed professionals, is essential for nurturing that ethic. Given the inherently hierarchical nature of the teacher/learner relationship, teachers have a special obligation to ensure that students and residents are always treated respectfully. 2. Commitments of Faculty We pledge our utmost effort to ensure that all components of the educational program for students are of high quality. As mentors for our student colleagues, we maintain high professional standards in all of our interactions with patients, colleagues and staff. We respect all students as individuals, without regard to gender, race, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation; we will not tolerate anyone who manifests disrespect or who expresses biased attitudes towards any student or resident. We pledge that students will have sufficient time to fulfill personal and family obligations, to enjoy recreational activities and to obtain adequate rest; we monitor and, when necessary, reduce the time required to fulfill educational objectives, including time required for call on clinical rotations, to ensure students well being. In nurturing both the intellectual and the personal development of students, we celebrate expressions of professional attitudes and behaviors, as well as achievement of academic excellence. We do not tolerate any abuse or exploitation of students. We encourage any student who experiences mistreatment or who witnesses unprofessional behavior to report the facts immediately to appropriate faculty or staff; we treat all such reports as confidential and do not tolerate reprisals or retaliation of any kind. 3. Commitments of Students We pledge our utmost effort to acquire the knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviors required to fulfill all educational objectives established by the faculty. 94 We cherish the professional virtues of honesty, compassion, integrity, fidelity and dependability. We pledge to respect all faculty members and all students as individuals, without regard to gender, race, national origin, religion or sexual orientation. As physicians in training, we embrace the highest standards of the medical profession and pledge to conduct ourselves accordingly in all of our interactions with patients, colleagues and staff. In fulfilling our own obligations as professionals, we pledge to assist our fellow students in meeting their professional obligations as well. Harriet F. Ginsburg Health Sciences Library The Harriet F. Ginsburg Health Sciences Library is located in the College of Medicine building and provides the latest in information technology, with networking and telecommunications to many other libraries and resources. The library's catalog records are in the same online catalog as the main UCF library's holdings. A virtual medical library is created by limiting the search to location, creating a medical library filter. Medical library clients have access to the State University Libraries (SUL) shared catalog, which will provide access to items at all state university medical libraries. Through participation in the Florida Center for Library Automation (FCLA), the Association of Southeastern Research Libraries (ASERL), the Southeastern Library Network, Inc. (SOLINET) and ad hoc consortia, the College of Medicine library has access to online periodicals from the majority of publishers of science journals (Elsevier, Wiley, Springer, Blackwell). Consortium purchasing also provides access to medical and science databases through ProQuest CSA and Lexis/Nexis. Expanded participation in medical networks, health networks and consortia provides additional access to health information resources. A high bandwidth link to the main Orlando campus continues to provide full access to global research and education networks and their associated resources. UCF is a member of the Florida Distance Learning Consortium. The consortium coordinates statewide licenses for educational materials and course management systems for use by member institutions. UCF is also a member of the Sloan Consortium, a national organization dedicated to advancing the state of the art in online learning. Relationships with affiliated hospital information networks are being addressed during the coming year. Health Services/Requirements Mandatory Health Information All matriculating medical students are required to have certain immunizations as required by Florida law: Two Measles, One Mumps, One Rubella (two MMR doses meet this requirement). 95 Hepatitis B series (three shots) and a surface antibody titer (takes a minimum of seven (7) months to complete this series). o Medical students are required to complete the Hepatitis B series. A postvaccination titer is checked after completion of the series. If this is inadequate, per CDC guidelines, the person is vaccinated with another series of Hepatitis B vaccine and another postvaccination titer is checked. If the student still has an inadequate antibody response, the student is labeled a nonresponder and counseled appropriately. Influenza inoculations are required in the fall of each year during the medical students' enrollment. Meningitis vaccination (Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4)). Tdap immunizations. (Important: Obtaining a Td booster alone will not meet the College of Medicine requirement.) Tuberculosis Skin Tests (PPDs). Documentation of a PPD skin test or last chest xray within past six months if positive PPD or positive history. Quantiferon Gold test is acceptable for those students with a history of a positive PPD. Varicella (chickenpox) titer or two dates of immunizations. A history of chicken pox does NOT satisfy this requirement. If a medical student does not complete the series of vaccinations and tests required by the time of orientation, he or she is directed to UCF Health Services to complete them. Immunizations are not covered by the mandatory health fee. Students are not allowed to register without proper health information documentation. Students should refer to the immunization form for specific details of requirements and acceptable documentation. For more information, students should contact the Immunization Coordinator, UCF Health Services website for additional information at http://hs.ucf.edu . Additional details regarding UCF Health Services can also be found on page 32 of this Bulletin. Optional health and accident insurance may be purchased by response to periodic mailers or by contacting the office of student development and enrollment services, Student Government, or the Health Services Business Office at 4078231087. Optional health and accident insurance is not part of the Health Services program provided by the health fee. However, the insurance, if purchased, will cover most of the supplemental Health Services charges and will provide for health coverage needs that are beyond the scope of the campus Health Services program, such as hospital referrals and specialty care. Charges incurred outside the Health Center are the responsibility of the student. When the Health Center is closed, students may obtain information and assistance from Health Services telephone message at (407) 8232701, by calling the 24hour, tollfree Nurse Line at 18005561555 to 96 speak to a team of registered nurses (a free service to all UCF students), accessing information at the website www.freeMD.com (the webbased interactive system to help make decisions about health needs accessible at http://hs.ucf.edu ) or, if the situation is urgent, by calling either 911 or the UCF Police Department. Health Services staff offer confidential testing for HIV. A program for anonymous testing is available elsewhere by calling the REACH HIV AIDS Education Office at UCFAIDS (4078232437). Information concerning these programs may be obtained by calling the Health Center at 4078232701 during regular hours. Medical History Report All new students must furnish medical history reports on the approved university health form before registration is allowed. The Immunization Form is available from the College of Medicine Office of Student Affairs. This form should be completed and mailed to the address on the form. Immunizations and diagnostic procedures may be required of students by the university prior to any registration. Where physician examinations or certificates are required, they must be signed by a doctor of medicine or by a doctor of osteopathy. The university reserves the right to refuse registration to any student whose health record or report of medical examination indicates the existence of a condition that may be harmful to members of the university community. Health and Disability Insurance Medical students need the protection of a comprehensive health insurance policy to help with medical bills which are not covered by UCF Health Services. Coverage by health insurance must be continuous and uninterrupted as the medical student progresses through the curriculum. The Health Services program at UCF is accredited by the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC). The Health Services program is staffed by physicians, advanced registered nurse practitioners, physician assistants, registered nurses, pharmacists and a full complement of other medical support personnel. Referrals to specialists in the Orlando area are facilitated by Health Service staff. Students are required to provide health insurance information on a Health Insurance Verification form upon matriculation. Medical students are eligible to enroll in the university sponsored Student Health Insurance Plan. Medical students who enroll in the university sponsored plan will automatically have their coverage verified. Otherwise, the student must provide additional documentation bearing the student's name by one of the following methods: a current health insurance card; a copy of the policy; or a company official's signature confirming enrollment. Because health insurance is required, any falsification of coverage will be considered an honor code violation. If plan coverage changes at some point during medical school training, the student needs to update his or her health insurance information on a new Health Insurance Verification Form. Each health fee paying student is entitled to the benefits provided through UCF Health Services and outlined in printed 97 material available in the Health Center. At UCF Health Services, there are no outofpocket expenses for most procedures done when the student has the university sponsored plan. Most office consultations and programs are provided without additional costs. Laboratory tests, Xrays, medications and some supplies require additional but significantly reduced payments which may be made with cash, credit card, personal check or charged to the student's account. Although students have their choice of carriers, the UCF Student Health Insurance Plan is designed to work in conjunction with UCF Health Services primary care. Students covered by the university sponsored plan must receive the initial consult through UCF Health Services unless they are out of the area and urgent care is required. At UCF Health Services, there is no outofpocket expense for most procedures done when the student has the university sponsored plan. Referrals to other services must be made through UCF Health Services in order for them to be covered by the university sponsored plan. The plan includes an option for dependent coverage. The current UCFendorsed medical insurance plan annual premium is about $1,900 (current rates and information can be found at http://hs.sdes.ucf.edu/healthcenter/insurance.html ) If a student is initially covered under his or her parents' health plan and later becomes ineligible due to age, he or she will have an opportunity to enroll in the UCF plan as long as there is no break in coverage. All College of Medicine matriculating students are required to have Disability Insurance and Professional Liability Insurance. Disability insurance can be obtained through the American Medical Association at a lowcost for M.D. students. An informational brochure can be downloaded at www.medplusadvantage.com along with other information regarding coverage. While enrollment in this plan is not mandatory, proof of comparable coverage is required if the M.D. student decides to enroll in another plan. The proof of disability insurance form must be provided to the College of Medicine, Office of Student Affairs. Certification of current disability insurance is required for each year of enrollment. The required Professional Liability Insurance coverage will be issued to students via a consortium agreement and the cost is included in the M.D. tuition and fee assessment. A certificate of coverage is provided to the Office of Student Affairs. Information Technology Office http://www.med.ucf.edu/students/technology/ This office, reporting to the Director of Information Technology, will assist students at the Health Sciences Campus with establishing email accounts (via Knights EMail), setting up their laptops to work with the telecommunications networks, providing information technology training and user help and other needs. This office is responsible for telecommunications, servers and their maintenance, networking and support, hardware and software, lab support, maintenance and personnel to provide computer security and to run the student computing facilities. The two instructional and research buildings are equipped for wireless access to the Internet and are set up to run commercial software to 98 provide medical materials for each course. Laptops with password protection are also provided for e mail messages. Information Technology (IT) Support The College of Medicine is provided with full access to UCF enterprise information technology services and resources, including: PeopleSoft Financials, Human Resources, Student, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and portal Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system Electronic mail Online learning course management system Web services Directory and identity management services User services help desk Software site and volume software licenses (Microsoft, Symantec, Adobe, Corel, SPSS, MiniTAB, etc.) Campus ID Card services Personal Identification Number (PID) PID is the key to accessing online registration, class schedule searches, managing courses, viewing your grades and fee schedules. Students obtain the PID on their first login to https://my.ucf.edu . The initial login uses a default password. Following instructions, students choose a new password and reminder clue. PID passwords can be changed at any time. Medical Student Clinical Duty Hours Policy The University of Central Florida College of Medicine will follow the duty hour guidelines set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). 1. Duty hours are defined as all clinical and academic activities related to the education of the medical student i.e., patient care (both inpatient and outpatient), administrative duties relative to patient care, the provision for transfer of patient care, time spent inhouse during call activities, and scheduled activities, such as didactic sessions, grand rounds and conferences. Duty hours do not include reading and preparation time spent away from the duty site. a. Duty hours must be limited to 80 hours per week, averaged over a fourweek period, inclusive of all inhouse call activities. b. Inhouse call must occur no more frequently than every third night. c. Continuous onsite duty, including inhouse call, must not exceed 24 consecutive hours. Students may be on site for up to 6 additional hours in order to participate in didactic activities. 99 d. Students must be provided with one day (24 consecutive hours) in seven, free from all educational and clinical responsibilities, averaged over a fourweek period. 2. This policy will be published on the College of Medicine website, in the clerkship handbooks, and in the faculty and preceptor handbooks. This information will also be covered in the COM Clerkship Orientation. Patent and Invention Policy for Medical Students http://www.graduatecata log.ucf.edu/content/ policies.aspx?id=5700 It is the intent of the university to foster the professional development of its faculty and students. In particular, the proprietary and patent policies serve to protect the interests of UCF students so that they can engage in research that will ultimately be published. In no circumstances should the university knowingly enter into agreements with outside agencies that would prevent the ultimate publication of the student's work. These policies also help to clarify protections for intellectual property for students who engage in employment outside the university. If student work is supported by a contractual agreement with an outside agency and provision was made in the agreement to delay disclosure of the study's results for the purpose of filing a patent or copyright, then this section describes procedures for handling the work. Only for those works where a prior written agreement was made between UCF and an outside agency or where the university wishes to pursue a copyright/patent may publication of the work be delayed, or in exceptional circumstances as determined by the university on a case by case basis. Review and delay of disclosure of the work may take up to six months. The review by the outside agency or by the university may take up to six months for the purpose of pursuing a copyright or patent. If material is sensitive, classified or will be patented, the work will not be released for up to six months. Contractual agreements that contain provisions for review and delay of disclosure shall be reviewed by the Office of Research and Commercialization. Exceptional cases may include a delay of disclosure for more than six months. UCF has three fundamental responsibilities with regard to student research. They are to (1) support an academic environment that stimulates the spirit of inquiry, (2) develop the intellectual property stemming from research and (3) disseminate the intellectual property to the general public. In most cases, UCF owns the intellectual property developed by students using university resources. The student as inventor will, according to this policy, share in the proceeds of the invention. University Authority and Responsibilities: Florida Statutes Section 1004.23 authorizes the university to take any action necessary to secure letters of patents, copyrights and trademarks on any work products 100 and to enforce its rights therein. This policy applies to medical students who are considered university personnel. 1. Definitions: For the purposes of this policy the following definitions shall apply: a.

The university also has a policy addressing the division of proceeds between UCF inventor(s) and the university (see UCF Regulation 6C72.029). It is also contained in the Patents and Copyrights Policy of the UCF Research Foundation. The same division of royalties will apply in the disbursement of royalty income to students as inventor(s), unless this has been negotiated in a separate contractual agreement. b. All sponsored research done by students enrolled at the university for and with companies must have a contractual agreement with UCF negotiated at the start of that research. Students must be informed at the start of the research about any contractual agreements that would concern future publication of their research work. Research Involving Medical Students It is the policy of the College of Medicine that research studies will not be conducted on medical students, apart from educational studies focusing on the curriculum. All requests for information concerning research and medical students should be directed to the Office of Student Affairs. Responsibilities of Students and Faculty It is the policy of the College of Medicine that student mistreatment, harassment or abuse will not be tolerated. Student abuse may be verbal, psychological or physical. It includes, but is not limited to, sexual harassment and discrimination based on age, racial or ethnic background, religion, national origin or disability. It is understood that all personnel will treat students in a collegial and professional manner. Student abuse and sexual harassment are best defined functionally. Student abuse includes, but is not limited to, treating students in a harmful, injurious or offensive way; attacking in words; speaking insultingly, harshly, or unjustly to or about a student; reviling or demeaning a student; and/or undermining the selfesteem or confidence of a student. Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited 103 to, offensive comments to or about the student; unwanted attention or unwelcome verbal advances; unwanted, persistent invitations; unwelcome explicit propositions; offensive displays; offensive body language; unwanted physical advances; and/or sexual bribery. Abuse and harassment create a hostile environment in which to learn. It is understood that incidents of abuse or harassment may cover a spectrum from flagrant to ambiguous and subjective. The abuser may be a member of the faculty, a resident, a nurse, another student, a member of administration, a hospital employee, or even a patient. Students who believe they have been subject to abusive treatment may report the allegations to the Associate Dean for Students in the College of Medicine, any faculty or staff member in the College of Medicine, or to the College of Medicine Associate General Counsel. If the student contacts a College of Medicine faculty member or staff member, that individual should report the incident to the Associate Dean for Students. The Associate Dean for Students will conduct a preliminary review and will refer the case to the Student Professional Conduct Council. The council will review relevant documentation, conduct an investigation of the complaint, which may include facetoface discussion with the complainant and with the individual about whom the complaint is being made. Recommendations for action will be taken to the Dean and executive cabinet if the complaint has merit. All proceedings are confidential. Materials concerning policies and procedures will be posted on a College of Medicine web page. During new medical faculty orientation, faculty members are educated on the policies and procedures for the prevention of student mistreatment. Written policies and procedures are included in the packet of materials provided. The director of equal opportunity and affirmative action programs (EO/AA) at UCF provides periodic training sessions on sexual harassment. The director, EO/AA, is also periodically invited to COM meetings to update the training of faculty and staff when it is determined that there is benefit. M.D. Curriculum Orientation First Year Orientation Orientation is a weeklong event conducted at the beginning of the academic year (during the first week). It begins with an introduction to the College of Medicine, faculty and students. During orientation students are paired with second year students which provide the opportunity for students to receive both faculty and student views on the ins and outs of medical school. First year medical students receive Basic Life Support (BLS) for health professionals training during this period. A White Coat ceremony is included in the first week of orientation to the College of Medicine. Details about this ceremony can be found on page 109, under FirstYear Curriculum. 104 Second Year Orientation Second year orientation is conducted during the beginning of the academic year. In addition to participating in their own orientation, second year students are encouraged to participate in all aspects of the first year orientation process so that incoming students may benefit from their experience. Academic Calendar The M.D. Program's Academic Calendar is available at: med.ucf.edu/academics/ registrar/calendar.asp . All dates are subject to change. The calendar is only available electronically. Holidays may be waived for students serving in clinical clerkships at the discretion of the clinical Clerkship Directors. Overview The College of Medicine's mission is to educate and inspire individuals to be exemplary physicians and scientists, leaders in medicine, scholars in discovery, and adopters of innovative technology to improve the health and well being of all. This patientcentered mission is achieved by outstanding medical care and services, groundbreaking research, and leading edge medical and biomedical education in an environment enriched by diversity. To that end, students accepted into this program spend time in a variety of clinical settings, particularly with college partners at Florida Hospital and Orlando Health, so that they come in regular contact with patients from diverse ethnic and sociologic backgrounds that manifest an equally diverse array of medical problems. Students are also given ample time to conduct individualized study and research. Success ultimately rests in the longterm accomplishments of the college's medical graduates. The College of Medicine educates individuals to become exemplary physicians, leaders in medicine, scholars in science, innovators in medical technology and compassionate providers of health care for the well being of the community. Objectives The \"general objectives of the educational program\" have been defined by the M.D. Program Curriculum Committee as the core competencies expected of all graduates from the College of Medicine. The dissemination of the competencies is the responsibility of the academic leadership and includes the instructional staff of College of Medicine students that are employed by the college's hospital and clinical partners. Prior to teaching in the College of Medicine, all instructional staff in all years of instruction complete an orientation where they are instilled with the core educational competencies and the mission of the college. The medical students are also presented with the core competencies during their orientation through this Bulletin, the M.D. Student Handbook (pages 130133), and other electronic means of communication including the College website (www.med.ucf.edu ). The curriculum not only prepares physicians to practice medicine, but also incorporates several themes that begin in the first year and carry through until graduation. These themes address current problems 105 with medical education that must be improved to produce physicians who can think independently and work as team members of health care groups. One important theme is sensitivity to the social and cultural factors in medical practice\u2014particularly important in a region with a large minority population. The curriculum is designed to be evidencebased, incorporating lifelong learning so that graduates of the program will be able to keep current throughout their professional careers. Students must demonstrate that they can locate pertinent information, absorb it and interpret it and then use it appropriately for patient diagnosis and treatment. The overall objectives of the Doctor of Medicine degree program are to: provide an evidencebased curriculum to ensure effective learning outcomes. provide a curriculum that is flexible in its response to scientific progress in medicine, innovative teaching and learning methods and changes in societal and cultural perspectives related to health care delivery and clinical practice. provide medical education that will produce competent and compassionate physicians, sensitive to cultural, social and health issues. integrate clinical practice early into the curriculum to produce graduates with a comprehensive clinical experience. Curriculum Plan The course of study consists of four years of education. The basic sciences are taught in the first two years (the preclerkship years). Clinical practice begins in the first year of the curriculum and is enhanced by clerkships and subinternships in the third and fourth years of study. The clerkships and sub internships that take place in hospital and ambulatory settings are intended to expose medical students to clinical training opportunities. During both of the first two years, a Practice of Medicine instructional module parallels the other modules and integrates with the basic science modules to enrich the clinical connection. Incorporated into the Practice of Medicine is a Community of Practice component that provides opportunity for additional structured clinical interaction with the Central Florida medical community. All of the basic science modules include significant use of casebased learning and small group interactions. An important feature of the curriculum in both years is an independent learning and research instructional module, the Focused Individual Research Experience, that is intended to provide an early exposure to research and foster the pursuit of each student's \"passion.\" The results of these independent learning and research efforts are showcased in a miniconference near the end of the school year. This module reinforces learning in the other modules and develops a strong commitment to lifelong learning. Ethical behavior and a respect for human values are addressed throughout the curriculum beginning with the orientation where the College of Medicine Honor Code is introduced to the students along with a session about student responsibilities. 106 The preclerkship curriculum consists of lectures and small group discussions that focus on mastery of the relevant basic sciences. In addition, problem solving and clinical skills necessary for medical education are taught through the Practice of Medicine modules offered in years one and two. All modules referred to in this section match the curriculum schematic showing the instructional modules and systems. The curriculum schematic shows the approximate scheduling of the modules.

The first year concludes with the first of the organsystem modules, Hematology and Oncology (S1). Traditional basic science subject areas are vertically integrated across organ systems in each of these modules. Clinical practice begins with the Practice of Medicine (P1) that parallels with examples and case studies in the Human Body modules (HB1 through HB3). It includes training in areas such as clinical interactions with patients, awareness and understanding of the ethical and medicosocioeconomic issues in health care (including endoflife issues and socioeconomic related topics), an emphasis on humanities, community medicine and the development of skills necessary for effective communication with patients from a variety of cultural backgrounds and belief systems. In addition, firstyear students participate in a White Coat Ceremony in the fall semester prior to their first interaction with patients. The purpose of this ceremony is to emphasize the responsibility that they are assuming to provide compassionate and ethical care for their patients. The charter class of medical students was also given the privilege and responsibility of developing an Honor Code for the college. Also in the first year, the Psychosocial Issues in Healthcare module (C1) is designed to present the issues of health care in diverse cultures and socioeconomic populations. It includes the role of race, gender and religion in illness and healing. The small group discussions on the cultural context of medical decisions, respect for family and community beliefs and the need to take these into account in delivering medicine are important topics in the module. Among other topics, this course addresses physical abuse and domestic violence, substance abuse and human sexuality. Each medical student has as part of his or her program a research project requirement (Focused Individual Research Experience, I1 and I2) during years one and two of the M.D. Program. This work may continue in the third and fourth year. The goal of these modules is to fuel a passion in medical students\u2014specifically, to allow them to pursue their own interests while being exposed to research topics and scientific methods important to health care and medical science. The Focused Individual Research Experience module (I1) in the first year provides a basic grounding in scientific and research methods and exposes students to possible research focus topics through lectures, colloquia and seminars. Students choose areas of research and work with a research advisor from the UCF faculty (some students also have community mentors) approved by the course director. Students may choose to work in a broad range of disciplines. Students complete a research proposal and present their plan to the class at the end of the first year. Students are required to engage in self assessments and to devise plans to address areas in need of development in the second year. Many students use summer months to continue work on their projects. Students are required to complete all or a part of their project or study in the second year. Some opt to continue working through all four 109 years to graduation. The projects should be of sufficient quality to result in a scholarly presentation d continuing research in the fourth year, there will be another opportunity for presentation. and/or publication. The college provides funds in the form of stipends on a competitive basis to selecte students. To provide additional visibility for these research efforts, the college has included a mini conference on research that highlights the research projects of the secondyear students. The conference is scheduled so that both firstyear and secondyear students attend. For students 110 First Year Module Descriptions HB1: Molecules to Cells (eight weeks; five credit hours) Includes Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, Genetics and Preclerkship Informatics Description The objective of this module is to provide a better understanding of the biology and biological processes of healthy humans, and pathological states, from the molecular to the cellular level. The eight week module integrates the disciplines of biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, nutrition, pharmacology and cell biology. In this manner, students study the biomolecular structure of cellular components, learn about their role in molecular biology and genetics, and observe their functions inside the whole cell or within the cellular domain. As more molecules and cellular components are introduced, the relationship between molecular structure and its influence on a compound's ability to interact with other biomolecules is examined. Weekly topics include interdisciplinary discussions of nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, steroids, hormones, nutrients and metabolism and cell biology. Positioned at the beginning of the curriculum, the HB1 module provides the basic science foundations necessary for student success in the later modules. HB2: Structure and Function (17 weeks; 11 credit hours) Includes Anatomy, Embryology, Radiology, Physiology, Histology and Neurobiology Description This module is a multidisciplinary approach to fully integrate the disciplines of anatomy, physiology, histology, embryology, and neuroscience.

Students can apply their understanding of threedimensional anatomy knowledge to interpreting normal medical imaging. The module runs in parallel, and is integrated with the Practice of Medicine (P 1) module, so that students have the opportunity to apply their understanding of the normal body immediately to the interpretation of medical testing, diagnosis, treatment, and identification of abnormal findings and disease processes. This 17week module utilizes multiple learning modalities including casebased small group experiences, teambased learning, lectures, laboratories (cadaver dissection, medical imaging, and histology). Small group casebased settings are designed to understanding and applying the basic science concepts discussed in large groupexperience and to enhance clinical problemsolving skills. HB3: Health and Disease (eight weeks; five credit hours) Includes Microbiology and Virology, Introduction to Pathology and Immunology Description Health and disease is the final eightweek module of the integrated first year basic science curriculum. It provides the student with a thorough grounding in three major subject areas: microbiology, pharmacology, and immunology. The module also provides an introduction to some basic aspects of pathology. The most significant bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infectious diseases are covered in detail, with emphasis on epidemiology, typical clinical presentation, biological characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of causative agents, immune responses to infection, and treatment with antimicrobial pharmaceuticals. Students are also introduced to the major classes of antimicrobial drugs and their modes of action at the cellular and molecular levels. The infectious diseases are organized primarily by organ system in order to present information as it would be encountered in clinical practice. A combination of didactic lectures, largegroup case based discussion sessions, small group discussion sessions, and supplemental materials is used to deliver the content and to facilitate varying learning styles. Formative feedback is provided throughout the module in the form of weekly quizzes and practice questions. 111 S1: Hematolo gy and Oncology Hematology a ostasis, nd Oncology is an integrated overview of major hematologic diseases and basic neoplasia. The topics include hem anemias, nonn eoplastic blood disorders, basic neoplasia, carcinogenesis, cancer genetics, and hematologic malignancies.

Treatment methods include pharmacological, physical, and surgical modalities. 114 S6: Brain and Behavior (seven weeks; six credit hours) Description The S6 Neuroscience module emphasizes the molecular basis and pathophysiological processes of common neurological disorders. The module focuses on basic and common neurologic issues, integrated of their effects on other physiologic systems. The module includes an overview of neuroanatomy and neurophysi relation to disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system. This module offers an indepth understanding of the molecular basis of neurologic disorders, pathology, pathophysiology, diagnosis with an understanding ology, with cor and treatment. Inclusive in the study of nervous system disorders is the study of developmental and psychiatric disorders along with their pathology, diagnosis and treatment. P2: Practice of Medicine (31 weeks; eight credit hours) Description The Practice of Medicine (P2) is a yearlong instructional module that builds on the basic skills that were emphasized during the first year. This module begins with a weeklon ctory week provides an g introduction to the principles and application of the latest diagnostic tools. This introdu important foundation for medical microbiology, histology, flow decisionmaking. The tools include laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, serology, cytometry, immunohistochemistry, pharmacology, genetics), imaging methods 2D and 3D simulations, endoscopy, colonoscopy, angiograms, catheters), functional assessment (ECG, E pulmonary V/Q), and forensic pathology (genomics, autopsies, EG, Stress test, biopsies). In the P2 module, students continue to develop physical examination and communication skills and further prepare for clinical problems in medicine, such as patient interaction, ethical and medico socioeconomic issues, and skills necessary for effective communication. Problemfocused interviewing techniques and physical examination skills are mastered, with emphasis on compassionate dealing with individuals with certain medical conditions. Endoflife issues and socioeconomic related topics are covered with emphasis on humanities and community medicine. Communication with patients, other healthcare providers and the community at large are emphasized. The Community of Practice component is integrated within P2 as students continue to work with preceptors throughout Central Florida medical community, expanding their experiences with clinical patients in a manner fully correlated with the curriculum of the second year. As in P1, students encounter Standardized Patie d assessment of physician nts, and use simulation and webbased activities in this module for the learning, practice an skills. P2 culminates in a weeklong instructional unit presenting students of clinical problems without knowing the organ system being with a variety presented. These clinical cases incorporate problems from the entire spectrum of medical care. Emphasis is placed on how doctors think and act to manage diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas, including management of complications. Types of errors are identified along with methods for error recognition and prevention. Clinical cases are presented in both live and simulated case format. A major objective of this unit is to increase students' awareness of the need to be systematic and complete in their analysis of information available. This experience is intended to prepare students for situations they will likely encounter during the clerkship experience.
