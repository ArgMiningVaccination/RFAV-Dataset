Kubota Y, Iso H, et al. Association of measles and mumps with cardiovascular disease: the Japan Collaborative study. Atherosclerosis Jun. 18; 241(2):682-86, 2015 - Measles can be spread from fully vaccinated people to other fully vaccinated people. Rosen JB, Rota JS, et al. Outbreak of measles among persons with prior evidence of immunity, New York City, 2011. Clin Infect Dis May; 58(9):1205-10, 2011 - Measles vaccine failures cause outbreaks of the disease. \"This outbreak raises important questions concerning the relative contributions of vaccine failure versus failure to vaccinate.\" De Serres G, Markowski F, et al. Largest measles epidemic in North America in a decade - Quebec, Canada, contribution of susceptibility, serendipity, and superspreading events. J Infect Dis Mar 15;207(6):990-98, 2013 - Loss of immunity after MMR Vaccine and viral shedding, could spread disease and prevent herd immunity. \"If wild virus can be spread via individuals with subclinical infections, it is doubtful whether population immunity (herd immunity), which is necessary to eliminate the three diseases, can be attained in large populations.\" Trier H, Ronne T. Duration of immunity and occurrence of secondary vaccine failure following vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella. The MMR vaccine may be associated with brain autoimmunity and autism. \"Over 90% of MMR antibody-positive autistic sera also positive for MBP (meaning, myelin basic protein) autoantibodies, suggesting a strong association between MMR and central nervous system autoimmunity in autism. Stemming from this evidence, we suggest that an inappropriate antibody response to MMR, specifically the measles component thereof, might be related to pathogenesis of autism.\" Singh VK, Lin SX, et al. Abnormal measles-mumps-rubella antibodies and CNS autoimmunity in children with autism. J Biomed Sci Jul-Aug; 9(4):359-64, 2002 - MMR and other vaccines made with human fetal cells may be linked with rising cases of autism. \"Rising autistic disorder prevalence is directly related to vaccines manufactured utilizing human fetal cells.\" Deisher TA, Doan NV, et al. Impact of environmental factors on the prevalence of autistic disorder after 1979. J Public Health Epidemiol Sep; 6(9):271-86, 2014 - MMR contains human fetal DNA fragments that may be associated with autism and genetic mutations. \"This study is one of the first laboratory and ecological studies conducted that has examined the relationship between human fetal cell line manufactured vaccines, cellular DNA damage, and the worldwide autism epidemic.\" Deisher TA, Doan NV, et al. Epidemiologic and molecular relationship between vaccine manufacture and autism spectrum disorder prevalence. Issues Law Med, Spring; 30(1):47-70, 2015 - Emergency room visits are significantly more common in children who were recently vaccinated against MMR. \"There are significantly elevated risks of primarily emergency room visits approximately one to two weeks following 12 and 18-month vaccination.\" Wilson K, Hawken S, et al. Adverse events following 12 and 18 month vaccinations: a population-based, self-controlled case series analysis. PLoS ONE; 6(12): e27897, 2011 - Young children have an increased risk of requiring emergency care after MMR; Girls have an even greater risk. \"Our findings suggest that girls may have an increased reacto-genicity to the MMR vaccine.\" Wilson K, Ducharme R, et al. Increased emergency room visits or hospital admissions in females after 12-month MMR vaccination, but no difference after vaccinations given at a younger age. Vaccine, Feb 26; 32(10): 1153-59, 2014 Truth in science matters especially when it comes to our perfectly healthy infants, children and ourselves. In Merck & Co., Inc., the pharmaceutical company who produces the MMR is accused of fraudulently lying about the efficacy of its mumps vaccine. In 2011 our friends at Merck whom we most assuredly can trust with our children's health were fined $950 million for the illegal promotion of its painkiller Vioxx, which was withdrawn from the market in 2004. The settlement also resolved allegations that Merck made false and misleading statements about the drug's heart safety to increase sales. Ghostwritten studies appear to have been relied upon to support Merck's claim that Vioxx was safe and effective (sound framiliar?). A 2008 editorial published in JAMA questioned whether Merck might have deliberately manipulated dozens of academic documents published in the medical literature in order to promote Vioxx under false pretenses. It has been estimated that more than 60,000 deaths were caused by the Vioxx before being finally pulled from the market. "}
