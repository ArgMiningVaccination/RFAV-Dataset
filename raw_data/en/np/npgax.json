Many believe the risk is remote. At the same time, they look at the bright, emerging personality of their child and fear they might be condemning him or her to what one parent calls \"the growing army of lost souls\". Parents find it hard to fathom Government obduracy over the question of single vaccines: those who dare to question the policy put themselves at risk of being accused of scaremongering - even those who believe that their child's massively disabling autism must be linked with their MMR injection. As important, many parents who are disillusioned by \"slow\" Government action following the threat of BSE want swift answers to what might be causing autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). Epidemiologists, however, such as those who carried out the Medical Research Council's review of autism research, have scientific agendas, which often stretch, five, 10 and even 20 years ahead. In its last review of autism research, the MRC scientists could find no association between MMR and autism. Dr Peter Dukes, strategic policy adviser for the MRC research, points out: \"Of all the non-genetic theories around autism, the most researched one is MMR. That does not close the question, but no association has emerged.\" It is time, these scientists think, for the research agenda to move on, helped by the Government's recent announcement of \u00a32.5 million to fund new studies. Top of the action list is how to plan a major epidemiological study on the interaction between genes and such environmental influences as diet, drugs, allergies, infections and even subtle environmental shifts in the womb. The scientists also intend to focus on how and if gut physiology and immune reaction might play a part in provoking ASD. After the furore caused by Dr Andrew Wakefield's study at the Royal Free Hospital, which raised the possibility of an association between MMR, autism and bowel disorder, this will be pleasing news for him. In a recently published investigation of changes in gut physiology, Dr Wakefield is among colleagues who suggest the possibility of \"auto-immunity\" as a trigger of severe autism - though there is no mention of MMR. Not least, the MRC scientists propose looking at how specific psychology and education services can contribute to children's wellbeing, especially when introduced early - not before time, many campaigners might think. However, no research is planned to investigate those children who, their parents are convinced, were developing normally until they had the MMR vaccine. For such parents, the only way to produce answers may be through the courts. Already, 1,000 plan to do so, says Jackie Fletcher of Jabs. There are unlikely to be any early definitive answers to what provokes ASD. Nor is the MMR dilemma likely to go away, as the opinions below suggest. RICHARD NICHOLSON, former paediatrician and editor of the Bulletin of Medical Ethics, says government health officials are being \"economical with the truth\". \"Immunisation is the most cost-effective part of the NHS and should not be put at risk. I do not think the right studies have been done. I don't know from what has been said if there is a genuine possibility of a link with MMR. It cannot be ruled out and I have sympathy with parents who feel they might be putting their child at risk to provide `herd immunity' in the population. \"It seems to me the present situation reflects on the quality of civil servants in the Health Department. They don't rotate to different jobs, as in other departments: some have been there 15 years. We need some fresh thinking and more studies.\" SARAH OAKLEY'S son Patrick, five, is autistic, but she is convinced that MMR is not to blame. Patrick was given the first MMR injection before diagnosis. With hindsight, however, Sarah, a practice nurse from Ely, Cambridgeshire who injects MMR as part of her job, says there were signs of autism. \"As a baby, he made little eye contact, especially with unfamiliar people. He was very passive - a contented 'good' baby, you might think. But by two-and-a-half he still was not talking.\" Well before going ahead with the second pre-school booster jab, she and Jonathan, her husband, read all they could find about the evidence and the alternatives and talked to their paediatrician and to the nurse at their GP's surgery. \"My advice to parents is to make an informed choice.\" DR LORNA WING, consultant psychiatrist at the National Autistic Society's Centres for Social and Communication Disorder. \"It remains possible that MMR vaccination precipitates autism in a small number of children who are vulnerable. This might be because of genetic loading that would otherwise be insufficient to produce overt autistic disorder. The number, however, would be too small to affect the rates found in the incidence studies.\" SU THOMAS, co-founder of Pace (Parents' Autism Campaign for Education) and mother of Elliot, seven, who is autistic. \"I find it difficult to know - from what has been said - if there is a real association with MMR. My question to the Government is why it is taking such a hard line with parents over the choice of single vaccines, especially on the heels of BSE. A lot of parents feel it is arrogant. I also want to know why health officials are not putting more money into finding out why a growing number of children have severe bowel problems and about the association with autism. This is desperately needed - these are very sick children.\" JUDITH BARNARD, director of policy and public affairs for the National Autistic Society. \"The experts themselves conclude that there is the possibility of a susceptible sub-group that could be affected by MMR. The debate has reached beyond the scientific evidence into the political and personal arenas. The Government promotes choice in many areas of public policy. In rejecting it here, it may fail to recognise the desire for patient autonomy. The perception of paternalism may well lie behind parents' reluctance to give their children MMR. The impression we get from the many parents who contact the society is that they are not convinced by the Government's argument that choice of single vaccines would put children's lives at risk.\" PETER DUKES, strategy policy adviser for the Medical Research Council's Review of Autism Research. Tomorrow, he will be among speakers presenting the finding of the review to MPs. \"Those at the council who carried out the review do not rule out a real increase in autistic disorder over and above the rise due to more awareness and broader definition, but we would not bet a lot of money on it.\" He scrupulously avoids using the phrase \"link with MMR vaccine\" but he does say: \"Many people immediately interpret this as a definite association. Our view at the MRC is that it is doing the public a disservice to highlight a theoretical possibility as a significant one.\" JACKIE FLETCHER, founder of JABS (Justice Action and Basic Support) and mother of a boy, now aged 12, who developed autism shortly after being given the combined MMR vaccine. \"We have 1,600 members who believe their children have been damaged by vaccines. About two in three believe MMR led to autistic-like problems. Many say the onset of symptoms occurred within the incubation period of the disease strains in the vaccine. \"Yet, in all the studies here and from Sweden, Finland and elsewhere, none has looked specifically at children where the change has taken place so rapidly. Parents are confident their children had passed the development milestones with flying colours. One child was bilingual. In another case, triplets, again all doing well, developed high temperatures and drowsiness. All three are now on the autistic spectrum. One has severe bowel disorder.\" She finds it hard to accept that such cases of \"regressive\" autism have developed silently since birth. \"We know there are one-in-a-million vaccine side effects that can cause encephalitis or inflammation of the brain. We believe something along these lines is occurring, leading to side effects such as loss of speech, epilepsy and acquired autism.\" GEORGE KASSIANOS, a GP in Bracknell, Berkshire, and spokesman on immunisation for the Royal College of General Practitioners. \"The MMR debate is distracting us all from trying to find the real but complex causes. Without doubt, genes are at work. Recent studies strongly suggest autism begins in infancy or before. In one study, psychologists who were expert in autism were shown videos of normal babies mixed up with videos of babies who later became autistic. They were extraordinarily successful in predicting which babies would actually develop autistic spectrum disorder \"If MMR were relevant, we would see a jump in autism rates from 1988 when it was introduced. There was none. The college continues to urge parents to give their children the combined vaccine as the best way to prevent serious and potentially life-threatening disease.\" Dr Kassianos also urges politicians not to frighten the public. \"The MMR uptake rate in my surgery was 98 per cent until December when the local MP Andrew MacKay became very vocal about possible risks. Since then, it has dropped to 93 per cent.\" - Email Christine Doyle at [christine.doyle@telegraph.co.uk](mailto:christine.doyle@telegraph.co.uk) - Tomorrow: where "}
