This education benefit provides financial support for education and housing to individuals with at least 90 days of service on or after September 11, 2001, or individuals discharged with a service-connected disability after 30 days. You must have received an honorable discharge to be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The amount of support that an individual may qualify for depends on where they live and what type of degree they are pursuing. Approved training includes graduate and undergraduate degrees and vocational/technical training. The maximum basic benefit is earned after serving 36 months of active duty service or after 30 days of continuous service for those individuals who were discharged for a service-connected disability. Individuals serving between 90 days and 36 months of active duty service will be eligible for a percentage of the maximum benefit. Individuals will generally receive 36 months of full-time education benefits. This should allow an individual to receive benefits for a four-year undergraduate degree; however, individuals may continue to receive benefits for approved training at an institute of higher learning, including graduate training, provided they have remaining entitlement. If eligible for more than one VA education program, individuals are limited to a maximum of 48 months of benefits. Individuals transferring to the Post-9/11 GI Bill from the Montgomery GI Bill (chapter 30) will be limited to the amount of their remaining chapter 30 entitlement. Individuals will remain eligible for benefits for 15 years from the date of their last discharge or release from active duty of at least 90 continuous days. The monthly housing allowance is based on the school location and will be sent directly to the veteran for each month of enrollment in school training at more than half time. Those individuals who are on active duty, training at half time or less or those pursuing distance learning are not eligible for the housing allowance. The maximum yearly books and supplies stipend is $1,000 and will be paid proportionally for each quarter, semester or term attended in a school year. Payment will be made to the individual during each term he or she is enrolled. While previous GI Bill benefits covered undergraduate, graduate, certificate programs, on-the-job training, flight training, and non-college degree courses, the Post-9/11 GI Bill only covers college or university programs. To request an application form to apply for benefits through the Post-9/11 Veterans Assistance Act of 2008 or to determine eligibility call Joe Calareso, Admissions Director, at (305) 595-9500. ...

Acupressure therapy involves the application of physical pressure to acupoints by the hand, elbow or other devices. Pressure applied to specific acupoints can aid in symptom management and treatment of various ailments and conditions by improving qi flow through the body and rebalancing yin and yang. Acupressure reduces pain and other symptoms in affected areas of the body, increases circulation, reduces stress, and corrects health imbalances. A recent study indicates acupressure can enhance alertness. University of Michigan Health System researchers have discovered acupressure can combat sleepiness and keep students awake during class. The study appears in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine. The researchers report that students in a class who were taught to self-administer acupressure treatments to stimulation points on their heads, hands, legs, and feet were less fatigued and more alert. \"The study showed that a stimulation acupressure regimen leads to a statistically significant reduction in sleepiness compared to an acupressure treatment that focuses on relaxation,\" says Richard E. Harris, Ph.D., research investigator in the Division of Rheumatology at the U-M Medical School's Department of Internal Medicine and a researcher at the U-M Health System's Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. The 39 students included in the study were participating in three days of all-day lecture classes in the On Job/On Campus executive education program in U-M's School of Public Health. Students were instructed to self-apply acupressure regimens of either five stimulatory points or five relaxation points. The regimens consisted of massage and light tapping. Participants were divided into two groups. The relaxation group self-administered acupressure to the stimulation points on the first day and the relaxation points on days two and three. The stimulation group self-administered acupressure to relaxation points on the first day and stimulation points on the following two days. Sleepiness was assessed by the Stanford Sleepiness Scale and students also rated their levels of sleepiness twice daily. Students in the stimulation group had significantly less fatigue than those in the relaxation group. \"Our findings suggest that acupressure can change alertness in people who are in classroom settings for a full day - which could be very good news for students who have trouble staying alert at school,\" says Harris.\"Ideally, research in the future will help us determine whether acupressure also can have an impact on performance in the classroom as well.\" Both acupressure and acupuncture can restore mental clarity and awareness and can improve physical health.

Endometriosis can cause lesions, nodules, tumors, and other abnormal (although usually benign) tissue growth which can result in pain, infertility and heavy periods. These tissue growths tend to get bigger and the symptoms often get worse over time. Most endometriosis is found behind the uterus, on tissues connected to the uterus, on or under the ovaries, and on the bowels or bladder. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, endometriosis affects approximately 5 to 7 million women. There is no cure for endometriosis, but many allopathic therapies address the primary symptom of pain. Often pain medication and hormone treatment are recommended. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) modalities are often used successfully in the treatment of a wide range of female gynecological disorders, including endometriosis. TCM assesses the condition based on differentiated pattern manifestations, specific to each individual. Acupuncture points and Chinese herbal formulas facilitate the flow of energy through the body. These acupoints and herbs are utilized to break up stagnation, move blood and minimize pain. Depending on the TCM diagnosis of the individual, each acupoint and herb has specific therapeutic properties in the treatment of endometriosis. Acupuncture regulates the endocrine system and can act as an analgesic by elevating levels of endorphins in the blood. Findings from a recent systematic review by Cochrane Researchers indicate that Chinese herbal medicine can relieve symptoms in the treatment of endometriosis and produces fewer adverse side effects compared with conventional drug treatments. The review, comprised of two trials, included a total of 158 women. In one trial, Chinese herbal medicine provided symptomatic relief comparable to that provided by the hormonal drug gestrinone, but with fewer adverse side effects. In the other trial, Chinese herbal medicine was more effective than the hormonal drug danazol, and also produced fewer side effects. \"These findings suggest that Chinese herbs may be just as effective as certain conventional drug treatments for women suffering from endometriosis,\" says lead researcher Andrew Flower of the Complementary Medicine Research Unit at the University of Southampton. In addition to acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine, other TCM modalities utilized in the treatment of endometriosis may include moxibustion, qi gong and tui na.

Although acupuncture is often used as a primary therapy it is increasingly being integrated into combination treatment by conventional doctors. Back pain, headache, stroke rehabilitation, tennis elbow, fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, and asthma are among the conditions that can improve with acupuncture. Acupuncture is based on a holistic, energy-based health concept rather than a disease-oriented diagnostic and treatment model. One of the benefits of acupuncture is that the incidence of side effects is significantly lower than the adverse effects that may be experienced from allopathic medications or other conventional medical procedures. Additional health conditions that improve with acupuncture include chronic pain, anxiety, insomnia, digestive problems, menstrual cramps, weight loss, and infertility. Acupuncture strengthens general constitution. Many individuals receive the health and wellness benefits of acupuncture without experiencing any particular health condition. Acupuncture can boost the immune system, reduce intake of pain medication and relieve stress symptoms. As a non-invasive therapy for joint pain, acupuncture can significantly decrease pain, stiffness and inflammation. Acupuncture is often utilized as a preventative form of medicine.

Two out of five adults, or 12 percent, have received at least one massage in the last year, according to an Associated Bodywork & Massage Professionals survey. Consumers have few negative expressions about massage; 96 percent of those who received at least one massage in the last year have positive statements about massage therapy. According to the survey findings, a massage therapy session can favorably change perceptions regarding the value of massage. The increasing consumer demand for massage therapy confirms growing acceptance of the massage therapy profession, which has worked to legitimize its standing among complementary and alternative therapies. Compared to the 12 percent of consumers who received a massage in the last year, the survey found that 13 percent went to a chiropractor and 10 percent to a physical therapist. Of those who received a massage, the average number of massage therapy visits (nine) was similar to the number of chiropractic and physical therapy services. Of the survey respondents, massage therapy was especially popular among adults under age 50 and women. The market strength among younger adults bodes well for the massage therapy profession as these consumers age, suggesting that massage demand will grow. Survey respondents received massage therapy primarily for muscular soreness, stress and health restoration.

Nearly 27 percent of hospitals offer acupuncture and other complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies. CAM health care may include: Acupuncture, massage, herbal medicine, homeopathy, and naturopathy. Acupuncture is often practiced in allopathic hospitals in conjunction with conventional care therapies. Acupuncture physicians can treat and manage cases ranging from upper respiratory tract infections and postoperative and chemotherapy nausea to headaches, orthopedic and other medical conditions. Patients who choose to receive acupuncture often believe that acupuncture combined with conventional medical treatment is more effective in resolving their health care condition. Acupuncture can also speed recovery from surgery or illness. As hospitals increase CAM programs, patients who choose to integrate CAM therapies into their health care consistently rate their experiences more positively than patients receiving only allopathic health care. Integration of allopathic and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practice can positively impact patient quality of care. This approach to patient care has great potential to improve the hospital care system. As the medical community increasingly recognizes its benefits, and as more insurance companies include it in their plans, CAM hospital health care programs will become a more common component of wellness practice. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is one of the fastest growing health care professions in the United States today. Acupuncture & Massage College's Oriental Medicine program trains students to enable them to practice as primary, integrative and complementary health care providers. Students complete courses in Chinese medicine, acupuncture, herbology, Tui Na, and Qi Gong.

A sampling of programs may include acupuncture, massage therapy, hypnosis, stress management, and nutritional counseling. Millions of individuals have turned to acupuncture to treat everything from back pain and allergies to migraines and arthritis. Based in traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture is moving into the medical mainstream on a rising tide of new research studies and case stories. Health professionals are recognizing the importance of melding conventional and complementary medicines. There is increasing evidence that acupuncture is a cost-effective treatment option, and its use has become widespread in general practice, pain clinics and rheumatology and physiotherapy departments. Acupuncture has become increasingly utilized by conventional practitioners as the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture are better understood. Traditional Chinese medicine theory determines illness as resulting from imbalances or blockages in a person's Qi, or vital energy. The flow of energy is restored when acupuncture needles stimulate certain points within meridian channels that traverse the body. Acupuncture has been determined to be based on modern physiological principles. Many conventional physicians believe acupuncture stimulates the nervous system. The opioid and other neurotransmitters involved in needle stimulation affect pain perception, mood and health. Public interest in acupuncture has increased access to acupuncture therapy. More medical schools are offering course work in acupuncture. At the University of Miami's Center for Complementary Medicine, researchers are studying the use of acupuncture to treat drug addiction, Parkinson's disease and cancer. The number of health care professionals studying acupuncture has been steadily growing. Licensed acupuncture practitioners are discovering new career opportunities as integrative providers within mainstream medicine. Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine is one of the most rapidly growing health care professions in the United States, according to the National Acupuncture Foundation. Acupuncture & Massage College's Oriental Medicine program includes comprehensive training in acupuncture, moxibustion, Chinese herbology, Tui Na, Oriental nutrition, biomedical sciences, and clinic. The Oriental Medicine curriculum prepares graduates for national exams and graduates can apply for licensure in most states that license and regulate acupuncture and Oriental medicine.

Acupuncture & Massage College is asking the AOM community\u2014practitioners, students, schools, state associations, and our patient community\u2014to flood the phone lines. Call your congressional representative and ask him or her to co-sponsor HR 646. Call your senators and ask them to co-sponsor a companion bill to HR 646. Call the President at (202) 456-1111 and ask him to include HR 646 in the Healthcare Reform Act. Congressman Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) has reintroduced legislation that would make acupuncture a covered service for Medicare and the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program participants. H.R. 646, introduced in House on January 22, would amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage of qualified acupuncturist services under part B of the Medicare Program, and to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for coverage of such services under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The Federal Acupuncture Coverage Act would provide access to acupuncture for Medicare's 44 million beneficiaries and the 8 million federal workers, their dependents and retirees who are covered under the FEHB. Hinchey has introduced The Federal Acupuncture Coverage Act since 1993, his first year in Congress. Hinchey previously advocated for acupuncturists at the state level, where as a member of the New York State Assembly, he introduced and secured passage of legislation to license acupuncturists in the state. \"Passage of this bill would provide 52 million Americans with health coverage for acupuncture services. This is the humane thing to do and I encourage my colleagues to pass this important piece of legislation,\" says Hinchey. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) formed a consensus in 1997 that acupuncture works well for many ailments and should be included in national health care insurance plans. There are numerous studies which support acupuncture therapy as an effective form of treatment for a wide range of health conditions. More and more acupuncturists are signing up to become acupuncture providers for insurance companies. Many private insurance companies now offer policies that cover acupuncture and related services performed by an acupuncturist. You can find out if your insurance provides acupuncture benefits by calling your insurance company's patient information or benefits line. This number can be found on your insurance card.
