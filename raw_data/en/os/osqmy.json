In my office, I have begun using these wonderful remedies in my homeopathic practice with most impressive results. As a classically trained homeopath, I am finding a complementary place in my practice for both forms of natural medicine. What is Gemmotherapy Gemmotherapy are herbal remedies made from the buds or shoots of young plants. Herbal remedies are different in that they are typically made from adult plants. Gemmotherapy is known as the \"chimneysweep\" for cells. Gemmotherapy remedies have drainage properties that cleanse the cells of toxins. Although the body has natural ways to cleanse itself of contaminants, the modern lifestyle leads to an excess of toxins that the body needs to eliminate in order to be healthy. Pollutants found in our food, water, air and drugs accumulate in different organs of the body. In addition, stress can also cause affect the way in which cells and organs function. Elimination of Toxins The main routes that the body eliminates toxins and waste products are through the following: - Digestion (liver, gall bladder, intestines, stomach, pancreas) - Kidneys (urinary tract) - Lungs (breathing) - Skin (sweating) The heart, blood vessels, nervous system, and endocrine system (hormones) help promote optimal cell function. Gemmotherapy remedies stimulate the body's tissues to function and promotes elimination. There are over fifty \"gemmos\" which target different organ systems and their functions. History of Gemmotherapy The use of plant bud therapy was started by a doctor in Belgium in the 1950s. After extensive clinical research, French doctor Max Tetau, introduced plant bud therapy in 1971. He called it Gemmotherapy. How Are Gemmos Prepared? Gemmotherapy remedies are diluted similar to homeopathic remedies. Gemmos are 1/10th strength in a base of alcohol with glycerin and water. They are prepared in an amber glass bottle with a dropper. If sensitive to alcohol, place the open bottle in 1 inch of slow boiling water for 5 minutes. Cool the bottle before screwing on stopper. The shelf life without alcohol is approximately 3 weeks, as opposed to the standard two years. Dosage Gemmotherapy remedies are easily to administer. They can be taken in a beverage, preferably water, or directly under the tongue. If you are taking more than one, ideally they should be taken separately. Children usually favor it in a beverage. The dosage for infants is 5 - 8 drops, children 3 to 8 years old, 15-20 drops, and adults and older children, 25-50 drops. The remedies can be used as often as 2-3 times per day during acute illness.
