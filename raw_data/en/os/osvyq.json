The possession and use of marijuana has historically been prohibited in the US, as is true of other narcotic substances like heroine, LSD, and cocaine. In 1975, Alaska became the first state to relax the marijuana laws to protect the use and possession of marijuana in certain circumstances. In 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize marijuana. In many other states, marijuana use has been legalized or decriminalized in certain circumstances. Currently 27 of the 50 states in the US have decriminalized or legalized marijuana use under certain circumstances. Marijuana is becoming very popular in the media and its popularity as a recreational drug is growing. Marijuana leaves are popular decorations on T-shirts and movies and television shows depicting the smoking of the drug are becoming increasingly common. There are many popular misconceptions about the safety of marijuana which are now beginning to be substantiated by some Western doctors. Many people try to claim that marijuana has few or no potential health risks and that it is much safer as an intoxicant than alcohol. With the growing popularity and availability of the drug and the increasing misunderstanding about its effects on the human body, we are sharing some of the traditional wisdom of Ayurveda about this plant. Decriminalization of Marijuana First of all, we would like to commend the states of Colorado and Washington for legalizing the plant because we believe that it is not right to place restrictions on any naturally-occurring plant substance. Marijuana is used in Ayurveda for healing (after purification) and the legalization of marijuana helps those who practice Ayurveda to have a greater range of traditional Ayurvedic remedies available. Many of the herbs commonly used in Ayurveda for healing are potentially much more dangerous than marijuana, and we do not support the thought of restricting the use of plants for healing. Yet it is with great concern that we write this article, because we know the potentially devastating effects of marijuana when it is used as a recreational drug or without proper knowledge. To increase people's knowledge about the dangers of using of marijuana we are presenting some insight from traditional Ayurvedic knowledge. Marijuana and Ayurveda Marijuana (Cannabis sativa, C. indica, or C. ruderalis) is known as bhag in Sanskrit. It has a long history of use in Ayurveda. Marijuana is classified as a toxic substance by the ancient texts on Ayurvedic herbs, but it has been used in healing preparations after purification. It is mentioned in many of the ancient texts on Ayurveda like the Charaka Samhita, Sushruta Samhita, and Shargandhara Samhita. Marijuana is described as a toxic substance by Sushruta and the description of the toxicity of marijuana is elaborated upon by many of the Rasa Shastras (the texts on medicinal preparations made from Metals, Minerals and Toxic plants). The Ananda Kanda has a whole chapter dedicated to the herb, its toxicity, the procedure for purification, cultivation, preparation, and use. In this chapter, the Ananda Kanda describes 9 successive stages of marijuana toxicity. This text also prescribes various antidotal therapies to counter the toxic and narcotic effects of excessive use of marijuana. We must understand that in most formulas traditionally calling for marijuana in Ayurveda, that the marijuana is now usually omitted due to issues with legality. The use of marijuana in mainstream Ayurvedic practice today is virtually non-existent. Toxic Effects and Antidotes Ayurveda generally views marijuana as toxic to the liver and blood. Its inappropriate use can lead to all sorts of health problems. Its use in particular is prone to damage the liver, reproductive system; it can cause impotence or infertility, constipation, dryness of the skin and organs; it can deplete the immunity, strength, energy, motivation, happiness, and it weakens the sexual drive and the body's ability to heal. It can cause serious damage to the skin and connective tissue, and deplete the organs to the extent that they have difficulty to function. When not used properly, marijuana tends to aggravate all three doshas (vata, pitta, and Marijuana is said to have tamasic (dulling) and rajasic (agitating) effects upon the mind. Its long-term use diminishes a person's will and ambition and leads to dullness, confusion, lethargy, and depression. It is said to clog the mind and the subtle channels and be complete contrary to meditation and spiritual practice (which aims to develop a sattvic or clear and balanced state of mind). Not to mention all the potential health concerns like lung and throat cancer that arise when marijuana is smoked. Because marijuana is extremely heating and depleting, the remedies for over-indulgence are usually cooling and nourishing. They mainly involve bed rest, purgation, and the external and internal use of cooling foods like milk, ghee, and sugar and cooling stimulating herbs like camphor, cloves, and sandalwood. Sour substances like lemon juice and tamarind are also prescribed for countering the narcotic effects of marijuana. The herb calamus (Acorus calamus) has special properties to help neutralize the toxins of marijuana and to remove the toxic accumulation of drugs from the body in general. This herb works on the nervous system and mind and helps address the emotional issues leading to drug use also. If a person uses marijuana (or has used marijuana), it is a good idea to take a little calamus root to help detoxify the body. For those who smoke marijuana, small amounts of calamus may be smoked with it or a small amount of the power 1/8th tsp or so can be taken a few times a day with milk. Long-term use of marijuana damages the mind and nervous system and depletes the tissues. Nervine herbs like calamus, brahmi, amla, haritki, and sandalwood have specific properties to help the body remove the toxins accumulated from marijuana use and to repair the damaged nervous system. For treatment of depletion due to long term marijuana use, these herbs are best taken with nourishing tonic herbs like ashvagandha, shatavari, bala, and herbs of the ashta varga. Or the herbal confection Chyavan Prash (which contains most of these nervine and tonic herbs) can be taken with milk to cleanse and strengthen the body. Visha (Toxic Plants Medicines in Ayurveda) When used in Ayurveda, marijuana is never used in its pure state, but only after purification because it is considered a toxic substance. The Rasa Shastras list marijuana in the sections on visha (poisonous plants used for healing) along with other toxic plants. Extremely deadly plants like visha and ativisha (monkshood), visha-tinduka (poison seed), and gunja (red rosary pea) are categorized in Ayurveda as visha (or poison). Consumption of these plants will usually cause death. Plants with slightly less toxic effects are called upavisha; these include jaya pala (croton (opium). Marijuana is also in the Ayurvedic texts among the upavishas, or semi-toxic medicinal plants. Ingestion of these plants typically will not lead to instantaneous death, but they will damage the body and lead to toxic accumulation which can eventually be fatal. The shastras prescribe methods for shodhana (purification) of all these plants which render them non-toxic and safe for medical use. Marijuana and other toxic plants are only considered fit for use in healing after purification / detoxification. Extremely toxic metals and minerals like lead, copper, arsenic, and even mercury are also purified (and rendered safe and non-toxic) for internal consumption in Ayurveda according to similar procedures given in these same texts. These toxic metals, minerals, and plants are treated with great respect and care in Ayurveda for their great power to hurt or heal. All of these medicines are only ever taken in small doses, and for short amounts of time, when they are absolutely needed. Due to their extreme potency, their healing effects can be quite pronounced, and such medicines are very useful in conditions which are otherwise difficult to cure or incurable. Detoxification of Marijuana for use in Medicines The ancient texts give details for several procedures for the purification or detoxification of marijuana. These texts also list the adverse effects of the use of unpurified marijuana. For medicine, marijuana is almost always consumed orally and not smoked. The parts of the plant which are most commonly used in healing preparations are the leaves and fruits (called bhag). The unpolinated flowers (called gj), the resin, the seeds, and the roots are also used in some preparations (though the roots are considered especially toxic). Whatever part is used, Ayurveda always recommends some method of purification for this herb. One procedure involves boiling marijuana in the decoction of Babbula (Acacia arabica). Other methods involve mixing it with milk in various ways. The simplest procedure for the purification of marijuana involves soaking the herb in pure water for 24 hours. After this the herbs is squeezed to extract remaining liquid and then dried. After this, it is fried in cow's ghee over medium heat before storing for use in medicines. This process helps to reduce the narcotic effects of marijuana and removes its toxic qualities. In Ayurveda, only marijuana processed in this way is considered safe to use for healing. Marijuana which has undergone the process of shodhana (purification) is called shudha bhanga (pure marijuana). Whenever marijuana is called for in Ayurvedic formulas, it is assumed that purified marijuana be used. Dosage and Method of Administration Even in its purified state, marijuana is recognized as a very powerful substance which is only ever used in very small quantities. The recommended dosage for marijuana is up to 250 - 500 mg (about 1/8th - 1/4th tsp of powdered herb) 1 - 3 times per day. Marijuana is never used alone in Ayurveda, but as a component of formulas. Herbs are safer and more effective as a part of formulas in general, but this concept becomes even more important in the case of toxic herbs like marijuana. When taken in herbal formulas along with other herbs the residual toxic effects of marijuana are balanced by the other herbs. These formulas also are not taken alone, but along with with anupanas (substances to direct and enhance the properties of the herbs) like milk, sugar, or ghee. The use of cooling and nourishing anupanas with marijuana helps to counter its drying and weakening properties. There are several dozen important Ayurvedic formulas listed in the tradition texts incorporating marijuana, including Jatiphaladi Churna, Kumari Asav, and of Marijuana According to Ayurveda Marijauana is classified as hot and bitter, pungent, and astringent in taste. It is light, drying, penetrating, and has dulling and narcotic qualities. When used properly, it decreases kapha, increases pitta, increases digestion, and causes constipation. It has the potential to damage or heal the reproductive tissue depending on how it is used. In Ayurveda, marijuana has been used mainly to treat conditions of the digestive tract and respiratory tract. Its has been used specifically to treat sprue syndrom, irritable bowel syndrome, Crone's dis-ease, chronic malabsorption, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nasal catarrh, fever, and also used as a general tonic. Though many authors speculate that marijuana may have been used as a pain-killer due to its intoxicating qualities, there is little evidence in the Ayurvedic texts for this use of the herb. In the traditional texts on Ayurveda, intoxication is generally listed among the adverse effects of the improper use of the herb, rather than as a desirable healing property. Ayurvedic therapies generally aim to promote mental clarity and usually herbs and practices which dull the mind and senses are strictly avoided. In some cases Ayurveda has used marijuana to treat specific mental illnesses, epilepsy, and nervous system disorder. An Ayurvedic Perspective on the Modern Western Uses of Marijuana for Healing In the West, marijuana is gaining popularity as a medicinal substance for helping to treat cancer, the side-effects of chemo-therapy, glaucoma, epilepsy, HIV, diabetes, MS, nausea and vomiting, and to treat pain in general. Ayurveda would tend to treat most of these conditions using herbs with different qualities and properties than marijuana and for most of these conditions Ayurveda would not recommend marijauana as a remedy. Of this list of conditions which marijuana is routinely given for in the West, the only ones that Ayurveda would traditionally recommend marijauana for are nausea and vomiting, and possibly cancer, HIV, epilepsy and MS. Ayurveda has better herbs and formulas for treating all of these conditions. It is important to note that used in the wrong ways, marijuana could also cause each of these conditions. If marijuana is purified and used in very small amounts as a part of well-designed herbal formulations, it may be capable of helping to treat these conditions. If marijuana is taken in its pure and toxic state, if it is taken alone, or in large quantities, it will have great power to damage the nervous system, deplete the tissues and immunity and cause these conditions. When marijuana is smoked, its toxic effects are particularly pronounced, and many of its its medicinal effects are lessened. Ayurveda traditionally does not recommend smoking marijuana for this reason. In particular Ayurveda would not consider marijuana a useful substance for treating glaucoma (its effects on the condition are very brief and it does not address the root cause). Ayurveda also would not tend to recommend marijuana for treating pain (including that arising from chemo-therapy). As said before Ayurveda teaches that healing comes when the mind is clear. Ayurveda views feeling pain and difficult emotions as an integral part of processing the factors which have cause dis-ease and generally frowns upon any treatments that dull the mind or numb the senses. In general, Ayurveda would not condone the ways \"medicinal\" marijuana is being used in the West, but instead warn of the great dangers of using this plant in this way. First of all, we would like to commend the states of Colorado and Washington for legalizing the plant because we believe that it is not right to place restrictions on any naturally-occurring plant substance.

Marijuana in Hindu Spirituality Marijuana is considered a sacred plant by many Hindus but there is great misunderstanding about this. The sanctity of marijuana can be traced to the Atharva Veda where marijuana is described as one of 5 very sacred plants along with barley, darbha grass, sugar, and Soma. Later scriptures state that marijuana is sacred to Lord Rudra / Shiva and they detail the growth, preparation, and consumption of the plant for spiritual purposes. The spiritual use of marijuana, like the medical use of marijuana, requires elaborate preparation to help neutralize toxins. In addition to physical means of purification, various mantras and complex spiritual practices are employed for the spiritual purification of the plant before use. The scriptures have not encouraged recreational use, intoxication from, or abuse of the substance. The scriptures warn against the over-use of alcohol and other intoxicants and they teach against using any substances for intoxication. Many people (especially in North India and Nepal) now use marijuana as an intoxicant either as a part of religious rituals on special occasions or as a regular recreational activity. They use marijuana as an intoxicant and do not heed the warnings of the scriptures about intoxicants. They use the mention of this plant in the scriptures in an attempt to justify their habitual abuse of the substance. Many sadhus (ascetics) in these regions smoke large amounts of marijuana on a daily basis. Many will admit that they are addicted to the substance and also that consumption of the substance makes it very difficult for them to carry out the tasks that other people do like working or fulfilling obligations. These people are not realized souls but drug addicts and their abuse of drugs does not lead them closer to God but further from Him. The realized Gurus warn against the dangers of intoxicants just as the scriptures do. Most Gurus absolutely prohibit the use of narcotics for their students. Brahmins in India (the spiritual caste) traditionally abstain from alcohol, marijuana and other intoxicants, in addition to meat and other tamasic substances. Apart from rare exceptions for a small group of Brahmins in Nepal and far North India on the festival night of Shivaratri, the serious spiritual seekers in India abstain from marijuana and other intoxicants as a matter of tradition and from cultural wisdom imparted by the Saints and Sages.

Marijuana's Connection to Lord Shiva Marijuana is considered sacred to Lord Rudra the destroyer because it is toxic and has destructive effects upon human physiology. Several other very toxic substances are also considered very sacred to Lord Shiva / Rudra including dhatura, oleander, and liquid mercury. These substances are also offered in prayers for Lord Shiva but people do not take this to mean that they should consume these items in their unpurified form. The consumption of oleander or mercury in particular is potentially fatal. Thieves, storms, weapons, armies, and dangerous animals are also said to relate to Lord Shiva for the same reason; that they can threaten life. The fact that marijuana is sacred to Shiva does not mean that it is good for people to consume. Yet all of these toxic plant substances are taken internally after purification for medical and spiritual purposes. This practice is symbolic of the grace of the Lord which is powerful to turn even poison into healing nectar. There are stories in the scriptures of Lord Shiva consuming a great poison called Hala hala which threatened the welfare of all living beings. When Lord Shiva consumed the Hala hala poison it did not go to his stomach but instead got held at His throat which turned dark blue. In this way Lord Shiva transmuted the poison and freed the world from its adverse effects. For this reason Lord Shiva is also referred to as Nilakantha, or He who has a blue (nila) throat (kantha). This story illustrates Lord Shiva's connection to poisons, toxins, danger, trouble, destruction, and things that hurt life, and it illustrates how the Lord's grace helps to make these things into means for spiritual transformation. Procedures which involve the purification of toxic substances for use in spiritual practice are popular among the devotees of Lord Shiva. There are few substances on Earth more toxic than mercury and mercury is considered especially sacred to Shiva. The Rasa Shastras say that mercury is the living embodiment of Shiva in the world. Mercury is said by Ayurveda to have the power to cause or cure all sorts of dis-eases depending upon how it is used. For use in medicine, the processing of mercury requires eight subsequent alchemical procedures. For use in spiritual practice, mercury is further processed in eleven additional ways. This is a mystical / spiritual science which requires great discipline and spiritual purity and for which there are few living masters teaching the science. Mercury processed in these ways has the power to turn base metal into Gold (or a substance chemically very similar to gold), and it has the power to lead the spiritual seeker to quick liberation. For this great purity and intense preparation is needed. The transmutation of base metal into gold is symbolic of the turning of the jiva (the embodied soul) into Shiva (the Divine). Obviously this is a complex and deeply mystical science for which mistakes in the process can be fatal. The use of marijuana for spiritual practice and the transmutation of its toxic qualities likewise is a spiritual science which requires the instruction of a master, great discipline, dedication, and spiritual purity. The mistakes along this path may not be immediately fatal but can be equally devastating in time. These powerful but dangerous spiritual sciences are best learned under the direct guidance of a fully realized master or left alone. The Spiritual Effects of Marijuana The bliss of spiritual realization is great and it has been likened to intoxication. Life is full of suffering for most people because they are bound by ego and delusion. They see themselves as separate from the divine and they falsely associate with the mind and body. Intoxication for them provides a release from suffering because it dulls consciousness. For people who are suffering numbness is a release which can seem blissful. Spiritual practice also provides a release, great peace, and bliss. For this reason Hinduism and many other religious traditions have likened spiritual realization to intoxication. This is why Christians offer and consume wine as a religious sacrament. But for a person who has transcended the tendencies of the instinctive mind and risen to a higher spiritual consciousness, life is joyful and blissful. In this case intoxication is not viewed as desirable because when a person feels good numbness will remove him from the good feelings. We must understand that there is no quick or easy path to spiritual realization. True lasting realization comes through serious self-inquiry and disciplined practice over time. Suffering comes from a person's own doing and release from suffering also must come from a person's own effort. No drug or any other external thing can lift a person from his own suffering. Spiritual practice brings clarity and knowledge of oneself. The self is Divine, but to see this a person must be very pure and very clear-minded. While spiritual practices calm the mind and lead to clarity and independence, drugs agitate the mind and lead to confusion and create external dependence. Marijuana has long-lasting effects of dulling the mind and its energy also influences the areas where it is used. After marijuana use, the spiritual effects on a person's consciousness are that peace and happiness decline and agitation, anxiety, depression, confusion, and dullness increase. It is very easy to identify a habitual user of marijuana for those who have awakened the vision of the third eye through spiritual practices. The use of marijuana will be apparent in the aura of pot-smokers by the presence of a dark murky grey color pervading the aura and a weakened aura. This grey light is like a dark cloud which causes mental dullness, depression, confusion, and lack of confidence and motivation. The aura of long-term marijuana users becomes very weak (as it does during the acute phase of intoxication). This indicates weakened ojas (immunity), tejas (vitality and enthusiasm) and prana (life force) and lessened connection of the astral body to the physical body. The scriptures on Ayurveda warn of the dangers of spiritual possession by demonic entities during intoxication. This risk is greatly increased also for people who have used marijuana over a long period of time. When the mind is dull and depressed (focused on the vibrations of the lower astral realm), vitality is low, and the connection to the physical body is weak; the potential for astral attack is great. Due to the potency of the plant and the fact that smoking it releases chemicals into the air to spread around the places where it is used, smoking marijuana in particular not only influences the people who use it, but the places where it is used. This is like the opposite of burning a stick of incense or a smudge stick to purify one's home. The effect of marijuana smoke fills a place with toxic and stagnant energy which effects all who visit the place and can be seen as a dark grey cloud lingering in the place when viewed with the third eye. Like a place cursed by black magic or demonic entities, the places where marijuana is used become permeated with dark energies. In this dark energy, people become depressed and their motivation lessens. Happiness lessens and health declines. They become lazy, reclusive, and self centered. These effects can last many months after marijuana is burned in a place. They open the place and the people who visit it to dark astral influences because they connect people to the lower astral realm. The use of marijuana in Temples in particular is a dangerous practice which places people in great danger of attack by demonic entities, because doorways are already open in a consecrated temple to the astral realm. The dark energy of marijuana attract entities with harmful intentions and creates a dark veil which blocks the protections and blessings of the Devas (angelic beings) of the higher astral realm. Marijuana and Alcohol in Ayurveda Many people think wrongly that marijuana is safer to use than alcohol. People say that alcohol is processed by man and marijuana is naturally occurring. People claim that marijuana must be safe and non-toxic because it is a natural substance. Many naturally occurring substances like arsenic and hemlock are extremely deadly poisons. People also claim that the effects of alcohol are more harmful. Anyone who has seen a violent drunken brawl could understand where these misconceptions arise from. It is true that the immediate effects of over indulgence in alcohol are more pronounced and apparent. Yet when used in moderation, alcohol is considered safe to consume as a food. Ayurveda actually recommends the consumption of a small amount of alcohol as a regular food, after adding boiling water to remove its alcohol content and intoxicating properties. Its sour qualities are particularly suitable to balance vata dosha. Ayurveda has many traditional recipes for herbal alcohols in which the alcohol helps to increase the digestibility of the herbs and also helps carry the herbs to the nervous system and subtler tissues. Ayurveda teaches against drunkenness or intoxication in any form, but does recommend small amounts of alcohol as a nourishing food substance. Marijuana on the other hand is listed among the most potent and dangerous herbs and its use is limited to extreme health conditions only after due purification has been performed to reduce toxicity. Even when a person drinks too much and gets drunk the after effects last a relatively short time. For one day after drinking a person may experience a \"hang-over\" with pain, drowsiness, sweating, headache, and nausea. The after effects of marijuana, though less pronounced, last for many days or weeks after consuming even a small amount. The appetite is effected and the mental state is altered dramatically. Depression results and people's motivation to do productive activities declines. A scientific study published recently in in the Journal of Neuroscience has found that casual use of marijuana noticeably alters the regions of the brain which relate to emotion and motivation. This damage can be long-lasting and is not present in the use of alcohol. Marijuana is considered sacred to Lord Rudra the destroyer because it is toxic and has destructive effects upon human physiology. Several other very toxic substances are also considered very sacred to Lord Shiva / Rudra including dhatura, oleander, and liquid mercury. These substances are also offered in prayers for Lord Shiva but people do not take this to mean that they should consume these items in their unpurified form. The consumption of oleander or mercury in particular is potentially fatal. Thieves, storms, weapons, armies, and dangerous animals are also said to relate to Lord Shiva for the same reason; that they can threaten life. The fact that marijuana is sacred to Shiva does not mean that it is good for people to consume. Yet all of these toxic plant substances are taken internally after purification for medical and spiritual purposes. This practice is symbolic of the grace of the Lord which is powerful to turn even poison into healing nectar. There are stories in the scriptures of Lord Shiva consuming a great poison called Hala hala which threatened the welfare of all living beings. When Lord Shiva consumed the Hala hala poison it did not go to his stomach but instead got held at His throat which turned dark blue. In this way Lord Shiva transmuted the poison and freed the world from its adverse effects. For this reason Lord Shiva is also referred to as Nilakantha, or He who has a blue (nila) throat (kantha). This story illustrates Lord Shiva's connection to poisons, toxins, danger, trouble, destruction, and things that hurt life, and it illustrates how the Lord's grace helps to make these things into means for spiritual transformation. Procedures which involve the purification of toxic substances for use in spiritual practice are popular among the devotees of Lord Shiva. There are few substances on Earth more toxic than mercury and mercury is considered especially sacred to Shiva. The Rasa Shastras say that mercury is the living embodiment of Shiva in the world. Mercury is said by Ayurveda to have the power to cause or cure all sorts of dis-eases depending upon how it is used. For use in medicine, the processing of mercury requires eight subsequent alchemical procedures. For use in spiritual practice, mercury is further processed in eleven additional ways. This is a mystical / spiritual science which requires great discipline and spiritual purity and for which there are few living masters teaching the science. Mercury processed in these ways has the power to turn base metal into Gold (or a substance chemically very similar to gold), and it has the power to lead the spiritual seeker to quick liberation. For this great purity and intense preparation is needed. The transmutation of base metal into gold is symbolic of the turning of the jiva (the embodied soul) into Shiva (the Divine). Obviously this is a complex and deeply mystical science for which mistakes in the process can be fatal. The use of marijuana for spiritual practice and the transmutation of its toxic qualities likewise is a spiritual science which requires the instruction of a master, great discipline, dedication, and spiritual purity. The mistakes along this path may not be immediately fatal but can be equally devastating in time. These powerful but dangerous spiritual sciences are best learned under the direct guidance of a fully realized master or left alone. The Spiritual Effects of Marijuana The bliss of spiritual realization is great and it has been likened to intoxication. Life is full of suffering for most people because they are bound by ego and delusion. They see themselves as separate from the divine and they falsely associate with the mind and body. Intoxication for them provides a release from suffering because it dulls consciousness. For people who are suffering numbness is a release which can seem blissful. Spiritual practice also provides a release, great peace, and bliss. For this reason Hinduism and many other religious traditions have likened spiritual realization to intoxication. This is why Christians offer and consume wine as a religious sacrament. But for a person who has transcended the tendencies of the instinctive mind and risen to a higher spiritual consciousness, life is joyful and blissful. In this case intoxication is not viewed as desirable because when a person feels good numbness will remove him from the good feelings. We must understand that there is no quick or easy path to spiritual realization. True lasting realization comes through serious self-inquiry and disciplined practice over time. Suffering comes from a person's own doing and release from suffering also must come from a person's own effort. No drug or any other external thing can lift a person from his own suffering. Spiritual practice brings clarity and knowledge of oneself. The self is Divine, but to see this a person must be very pure and very clear-minded. While spiritual practices calm the mind and lead to clarity and independence, drugs agitate the mind and lead to confusion and create external dependence. Marijuana has long-lasting effects of dulling the mind and its energy also influences the areas where it is used. After marijuana use, the spiritual effects on a person's consciousness are that peace and happiness decline and agitation, anxiety, depression, confusion, and dullness increase. It is very easy to identify a habitual user of marijuana for those who have awakened the vision of the third eye through spiritual practices. The use of marijuana will be apparent in the aura of pot-smokers by the presence of a dark murky grey color pervading the aura and a weakened aura. This grey light is like a dark cloud which causes mental dullness, depression, confusion, and lack of confidence and motivation. The aura of long-term marijuana users becomes very weak (as it does during the acute phase of intoxication). This indicates weakened ojas (immunity), tejas (vitality and enthusiasm) and prana (life force) and lessened connection of the astral body to the physical body. The scriptures on Ayurveda warn of the dangers of spiritual possession by demonic entities during intoxication. This risk is greatly increased also for people who have used marijuana over a long period of time. When the mind is dull and depressed (focused on the vibrations of the lower astral realm), vitality is low, and the connection to the physical body is weak; the potential for astral attack is great. Due to the potency of the plant and the fact that smoking it releases chemicals into the air to spread around the places where it is used, smoking marijuana in particular not only influences the people who use it, but the places where it is used. This is like the opposite of burning a stick of incense or a smudge stick to purify one's home.

Genetic Modifying and Contamination of Marijuana Many naturalists and health food enthusiasts who use organic foods and household products, and who avoid chemicals, preservatives, and genetically modified substances, indulge in marijuana. Such people view marijuana as a safe substance because it is a natural plant substance. Most people do not realize that many of the marijuana strains available in the US today have been genetically modified by powerful drug cartels to contain higher levels of THC. Because it has not been engineered by the big food companies people tend to assume that marijuana is safe from genetic modification, but this is not the case. The marijuana available today also is often laced with other narcotic substances which are toxic chemicals added to enhance its narcotic effects. Even where marijuana has been legalized and is bought in legal marijuana stores the potential for adulteration is present. These chances are much greater in states where marijuana must be acquired through illegal sources. In the case of illegal marijuana the situation is much worse. One of the principle concepts of organic production is that organic products must be made with respect for the Earth and the people who produce, process, and distribute the product. Milk which is organic must come from cows who are treated humanely and it must be processed, packed, and shipped by workers who are treated well and compensated fairly for their work. Many people have high standards about this when it comes to food and the household products that they buy. People who routinely boycott large multinational corporations for their use of child labor or slave labor in foreign countries, must remember that if they buy illegal marijuana, they are directly supporting the drug cartels. Even the least socially minded of the corporations must do business within the laws of the countries they work in, but the activities of those who import illegal substances like marijuana are not subject to any laws because they function outside the law. They use fear, violence, and intimidation to deal with all who get in their way. The energy of fear and violence is great surrounding illegal marijuana. Illegal marijuana has the energy of fear and suffering of all the people who have died or been hurt in the efforts to evade legal authorities inextricably attached to it. Such substances will never be capable of healing or bring any benefits to the people who use them because they have been produced by fear, violence, and suffering. They bring pain, fear, and suffering on all who use distribute or use them. There are very few substances on Earth which are so highly charged with negative energy. It may be easy for people to ignore the unseen suffering of others, but when they understand that this suffering is carried to them karmically and energetically as they use marijuana, perhaps they will reconsider. People do not always think about these things but if they seek happiness, if they are health-conscious, spiritual-minded, or interested in benefiting society, they must consider all these factors before they decide to buy, sell, or use marijuana.
