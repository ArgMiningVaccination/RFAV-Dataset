Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U)This program element supports basic medical research at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) and provides the only programmed research funds received by the University. This program facilitates the recruitment and retention of faculty, supports state-of-the-art capabilities for training military medical students and resident fellows, and allows the collection of pilot data by the University`s faculty researchers. Pilot data allow the faculty to secure research funds from extramural sources (estimated $25-$30 million annually). Eighty to 100 intramural research projects are active each year, including 20-25 new starts. Projects are funded on a peer-reviewed, competitive basis. Results from these studies contribute to the fund of knowledge intended to enable technical approaches and investment strategies within Defense Science and Technology (S&T) programs. (U)The ILIR program at USUHS is designed to answer fundamental questions of importance to the military medical mission of the Department of Defense in the areas of Combat Casualty Care (CCC), Infectious Diseases (ID), Military Operational Medicine (MOM), and Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) Medical Defense. The portfolio of research projects will vary annually because this research is investigator-initiated. Examples of typical research efforts are: Combat Casualty Care: ischemia and reperfusion injury, traumatic brain and peripheral nerve injury, neural control of pain, endotoxic shock, malignant hyperthermia, inflammation and wound healing. Infectious Diseases: immunology and molecular biology of bacterial, viral and parasitic disease threats to military operations. These threats include E. coli and their shiga toxins, HIV, HTLV-1, strongyloides, (VEE), malaria, and bartonellosis. Military Operational Medicine: sustainment of individual performance, deployment and operational stressors, cognitive enhancement, military & medical training readiness.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT: (U) P103, University Research Initiative (URI). The URI has three primary objectives: (1) to support basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines pertinent to maintaining the U.S. military technology superiority; (2) to contribute to the education of scientists and engineers in disciplines critical to defense needs; and (3) to help build and maintain the infrastructure needed to improve the quality of defense research performed at universities. Paralleling these objectives, this project competitively supports programs at universities nationwide in three interrelated categories: Research . The main thrust of the URI is the multidisciplinary research program of the University Research Initiative (MURI). MURI efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high -priority topics that intersect more than one traditional technical dis cipline; for many complex problems, this multidisciplinary approach serves to accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results to application. In FY 2001, two additional thrusts are university research for the National Nanotechnology Initiative and for critical military infrastructure protection. The URI also supports the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single -investigator research efforts performed by outstanding scientists and engineers early in their independent research careers.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE PE 0601103D8Z UNCLASSIFIED Education . The URI promotes graduate education in science and engineering for U.S. citizens through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program. Infrastructure . URI support for the development of research infrastructure responsive to defense needs includes two programs in the FY 2001 budget request. The Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) allows researchers to purchase more costly items of research equipment than typically can be acquired under single -investigator awards. The URI Support Program (URISP) broadens the base of academic institutions participating in defense research by involving institutions that historically have not received much defense funding. The programs within this project P103 accomplish their infrastructure -building objectives in conjunction with the Defense Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research that is in project P104 of this program element through FY 2000. (U) P 104, Defens e Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research ( DEPSCoR). The DEPSCoR helps to build infrastructure for research and education by involving institutions of higher education in states that historically have not received much Federal research funding. It is executed in coordination with state committees formed for the National Science Foundation's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research. Beginning in FY 2001, the DEPSCoR is moved from project 104 within this URI program element into a new program element (PE 0601114D8Z).

The FY 1999 MURI competition conducted by the Services resulted in 19 new awards in the following, high -priority areas of multi -Service interest: semiconductor physics; nanolithography; novel optical and infrared materials; biosensors for detection of chemical and biological agents; quantum information physics; propulsion, vacuum microwave electronics; radiation hardening; ionospheric characterization; and computational design of materials. Fundamental advances in these areas will enable the development of new technologies applicable to a broad range of future military systems. The multidisciplinary nature of these areas, and their multi -Service relevance, make them ideally suited for inclusion under the multidisciplinary element of the URI. In addition to the new MURI efforts, multidisciplinary and PECASE programs begun in prior years continued, with new competitive awards for PECASE programs. ( $137.212 Millio n) Education . Under the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship program, 122 new graduate fellowships were competitively awarded for study leading to advanced degrees in science and engineering fields of importance to national defense. ( $15.961 Millio n) Infrastructure . More than 230 new awards were made under the FY 1999 DURIP competition, enabling the purchase of research instrumentation needed to sustain universities' capabilities to perform cutting -edge defense research. Under the URI Support Program, efforts initiated in prior years continued in areas such as electronic and magnetic materials, image analysis, micromanufacturing, and neurodynamics. The FY 1999 competition under the DEPSCoR program resulted in 67 new awards.

The new techniques that the researchers developed for constructing and managing imagery data enabled them to make full use of the information in hundreds of spectral bands from multiple sensors spanning the infrared to ultraviolet portions of the electromagnetic spectrum; previously available methods exploited only a small number of bands. The researchers also achieved five -fold improvements in registration accuracy, enabling features derived from information in multiple spectral bands to be determined with an accuracy of 1-2m (0.5-1 pixel), compared with previous results of 5-10m (2-4 pixels) for this type of imagery. New methods were developed and demonstrated for automatically extracting urban features such as buildings and, for the first time, road grids, from multiple image sources; this resulted in improved detection rates of the features with much reduced false alarm rates. The researchers derived three-dimensional information by combining the data obtained from the new techniques with terrain elevation data acquired by photogrammetric means, and they created a virtual -reality environme nt for viewing, analyzing, and verifying the three -dimensional information. This research accomplishment is a significant step in the development of algorithms and tools for generating terrain and urban data that are needed to support military requirements for accurate, consistent, and timely battlefield visualization. Researchers from the University of Southern California, University of California at Berkeley, California Institute of Technology, State University of New York at Buffalo, North Carolina State University, and University of Washington developed a new theory that predicts how molecules come together and assemble themselves into structures. The theory is the first to take into account the three -dimensional shape of molecules and the dipole mome nts that result from the spatial distribution of electrons and nuclei (previous theories treated the dipoles as point charges), as well as the external forces and molecular dynamics that affect molecular self -assembly. Applying the new theory to polymers , the researchers were able to explain anomalies, unique nanoscale topologies, that had been observed in certain polymerization reactions. They also were able to predict that polymers with higher electro -optical coefficients would result if the self -assembled molecules were more spherical in shape. In this way, they designed and made polymers with twice the electro -optical coefficients of previous polymers; photonic devices made from the polymers require less applied voltage to stimulate the same change in refractive index, making it possible to modulate high frequency (up to 100 Gigaherz) signals with drive voltages of less than one volt. This can improve the efficiency of radio frequency links by a factor of more than one hundred. The new polymers can be used in photonic applications such as high speed communications or advanced radar technology using direct radio frequency modulation. The ability to control the self-assembly in a broad range of materials, not just polymers, has a broad range of defense applications in areas that depend on nanoscale structures, such as molecular -scale electronic circuits, ultra -high density memories for data storage, and complex miniaturized machines.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE PE 0601103D8Z UNCLASSIFIED Computer scientists at the Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pittsburgh developed the first comprehensive system of intelligent software \"agents,\" which can automate time -consuming tasks that otherwise would require human resources to gather information and make decisions or act on it. The agents are programs that have a certain amount of internal expertise (e.g., knowing how to carry out certain actions or how to get information from certain sources), that operate autonomously to decide when to carry out various tasks or communicate with other agents, that clone themselves when needed and move from one system to another, and that carry out standing orders or report back to a human user when there is something to report. The researchers' analysis and modeling generated the algorithms, protocols, and languages needed to produce the first system architecture that addresses all aspects of the problem: how agents interact with human users; how they interact with information resources; and how they communicate with each other and the network as a whole, to decide how to optimally apportion among themselves the elements of a complex task. The advantages of this comprehensive approach are that it yields systems that are easy for non-experts to learn to use quickly and that are easily built up in an incremental way, while the system is being used, to larger-scale systems for increasingly complex problems. Prototypes of the system have been used in several applications, including: (1) automating support for technicians at Warner -Robbins Air Force Base, reducing delays in aircraft maintenance due to paper exchanges of information with engineers and logisticians; and (2) tracking of real and simulated forces, including both personnel and equipment, for command and communications aspects of wargames using the Modular Semiautomated Forces simulated battlefield. The long -term value to the military is in getting humans out of the loop for complex but routine tasks that can be performed as well by software agents. Scientists at the University of California at San Diego developed novel metallic -intermetallic, laminated composites as model materials for armor design and for possible use in tanks and other systems. The materials are lightweight (less than 4 grams/cm3), easily processed in a laboratory with a mechanical press and inductive heating, inexpensive (created from commercially available foils), and have been demonstrated to stop 7.62 -millimeter, small-arms rounds at velocities as high as 870 meters/second. The researchers successfully fabricated materials using several metal combinations, including titanium -aluminum, nickel-aluminum, and stainless steel-aluminum. They also produced advanced composite materials with a thick ceramic phase between intermetallic layers, with ceramic -particulate reinforced layers, and with cor rugated interfaces between layers. Each of these advanced materials exhibits unique advantages in ballistic performance, such as the tendency for corrugated, metallic- intermetallic composites to induce rotation in penetrators (thereby dramatically decreasing the depth of penetration into the composite). The scientists are using a unique Eulerian, finite -element, computer model to characterize and predict the deformation and fracture of these materials. The computational work currently is focused on optimizing the number and thicknesses of the laminate layers and the geometries of the interfaces; the goal is to understand the fundamental mechanisms that govern the material's response to a penetrating projectile. The expected benefits to the DoD are armor materials that are lighter, easier and less expensive to fabricate, and have better ballistic performance than conventional armor designs.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH PE UNCLASSIFIED FY 2000 Plans: Research .

LL is operated as a FFRDC administered by the DoD, and is unique among DoD FFRDCs. It has no funding sources other than the Line for its innovative research and development efforts. This is due to the fact that LL is operated by MIT at no fee and may not charge for IR&D (under A-21). Other DoD FFRDCs do charge a fee with which they may support research efforts. (U)The LL Line funds research activities that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, new technologies, and new components and materials. Historically, the Line funding supported many development and demonstration programs which have led to such significant DoD systems as JSTARS, MILSTAR, GEODSS, as well as to solid-state devices and processes of major importance to the military industrial base. In addition to being the foundation for many new LL programs, the Line also supports other ongoing Laboratory programs with state-of-the-art technology developments. The program has the following 4 research elements: Target surveillance and recognition , with emphasis on (1) revolutionary sensing techniques and algorithms for detecting and recognizing battlefield targets both in the clear and in difficult deployments, (2) supporting data collection and phenomenology, (3) fundamental target-recognition bounds and their implications for sensor and algorithm design, and (4) revolutionary new approaches for automated passive sonar target classification of submarine targets and discrimination of submarines from surface ship clutter.

The system was successfully tested in a series of laboratory experiments to demonstrate utility in detection and identification of concealed targets in a low-light, highly-cluttered environment. A series of outdoor tests designed to verify performance in concealed target detection and demonstrate range-gating ability were also conducted. Applications for the baseline system include mine detection, optical taggant discrimination and man or vehicle vision enhancement.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U)This program supports applied research to investigate new approaches that will lead to advancements in biomedical strategies for preventing, treating, assessing and predicting the health effects of ionizing radiation, either alone or in combination with other biological warfare (BW)/chemical warfare (CW) toxicants. The premise is that DoD must be ready to conduct tactical, humanitarian or counterterrorism missions within radiation environments. Development of protective and therapeutic strategies will enable military forces to operate, when required, in nuclear or radioactive combat environments, while minimizing both short- and long-term risks of adverse health consequences. Advancements in tools to measure radiation exposure to military personnel will be used in triage, treatment decisions and risk assessment. Accurate models to predict casualties, particularly in combined nuclear-biological-chemical NBC environments, will promote effective command decisions and force structure planning to ensure mission success. (U)The program has three primary goals: (1) to understand the pathological consequences of radiation injury and radiological hazards in order to provide a rational basis for prophylactic and therapeutic drug development; (2) to develop novel biological markers and delivery platforms for rapid, field-based individual dose assessment; (3) to define any interactions between radiation and BW or CW agents that cause more severe injury and the drugs used to protect against them -- with the goal of developing new models to predict casualties. (U)The Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), because of its multidisciplinary staff and facility resources, is uniquely qualified to execute the program prescribed by its mission. AFRRI`s radiation sources allow the simulation of any radiological environment that might be encountered. AFRRI is currently the sole laboratory with the combined capabilities needed to conduct this research.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 Cost to 8.875 8.680 8.921 9.130 9.289 9.423 8.875 8.680 8.921 9.130 P505 Radiation Injury Assessment and Therapeutic Approa ch (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY1999 Accomplishments: (U) Identified new approaches for developing preventive treatments of both acute and chronic radiation injuries based on (a) applied knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of cellular and molecular injury, (b) selection of novel, less toxic, but equally effective drugs, (c) pharmacologic quenching to reducing drug toxicity, and (d) new drug delivery alternatives.

More importantly, this relatively small DoD contribution effectively taps the annual billion-dollar DOE RDT&E investment by accessing the specialized skills, scientific equipment, facilities and computational tools not available in DoD. (U)The effort exploits the extensive and highly developed technology base resident in the National Laboratories relevant to achieving the goal of developing capable, cost-effective conventional munitions, and leverages DoD investments with matching DOE investments. The current program supports 43 projects in warhead technology, energetic materials, advanced initiation and fuze development, munitions lifecycle technology and demilitarization, and computer simulation. A specific Service laboratory sponsors each of these active projects. The program is administered and reviewed by a Joint Technical Advisory Committee composed of members from the Army, Navy, Air Force, OSD, and DOE. Projects are peer-reviewed semi-annually by DoD Service Laboratory/Technical Center personnel in order to monitor technical excellence and insure that the technologies under development address priority DoD needs. The program is integrated with Service efforts through the Project Reliance Weapons Panel and participation in the Defense Technology Area Plan for Conventional Weapons. The program is reviewed under the Technology Area Review and Assessment process.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY1999 Accomplishments: (U)This development effort continues to provide improved component options for use in electronic safing, arming and firing systems. The objective is to provide a set of characterized, qualified, generic components (and suppliers) and to demonstrate their use in prototype designs. A primary challenge is to extend the technology to high-velocity penetrating weapons and to artillery and mortar rounds. This requires significantly reducing system size and cost while increasing the operational capability and survivability and maintaining safety and reliability. Component advances in transformers, low-energy chip slapper detonators, capacitors and switches were achieved this year. These were demonstrated in a working prototype electronic safing and arming device (ESAD) that represents a factor of 7 reduction in size and a factor of 5 reduction in cost over currently fielded technology. New commercial vendors were successfully developed to replace component sources that have withdrawn from the defense business. A focus this year was on shock hardening to support Service initiatives in high-velocity penetrators. Critical ESAD components were shock tested to penetrating weapon environments of 35,000-G with encouraging results. Switches, capacitors and detonators as a group survived quite well. A penetrator survivable chip slapper detonator was developed using a new surface mounting technology. The assembled device, including slapper, cable and explosive column, was successfully fired after exposure to 35,000-G shocks. Tests were also performed on powered components. A switch/capacitor combination was fired under shock. Various formulations for detonator explosive pellets were developed and evaluated, and promising shock survivable candidates were identified. Multi-point detonators are the enabling technology for advanced aimable and target-adaptable warheads. Multi-point detonator arrays using 2, 4, and 40 low-energy chip slappers were successfully produced and fired. However, sensitivities of the detonator arrays to manufacturing variations in the detonators were identified. An effort to understand and accommodate the observed current oscillations and to provide more robust designs was initiated. ($ 2.31 Million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Joint DoD/DOE Munitions PE 0603225D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U)DoD and DOE have very similar requirements for energetic materials. Both agencies desire high explosives with increased or tailored performance and decreased sensitivity. Recent accomplishments have benefited both agencies. Characterization work was begun on LLM-105, a dense, thermally stable, insensitive high explosive with 81% of the energy of HMX. A more powerful explosive first synthesized by the Russians, diaminodinitroethylene (DADE), was also synthesized in sufficient quantities to obtain preliminary performance information. DADE appears to have performance similar to RDX with reduced sensitivity and appears to be an attractive candidate for use in advanced gun propellants. A joint evaluation/development program is underway with the Navy for both of these new materials. Two additional promising energetic materials have been identified: DAAF, an insensitive material with performance similar to Composition B, and ANTZDO, which is predicted to be more energetic than HMX but much less sensitive to impact. A bench-scale effort was initiated to produce sufficient DAAG material for further evaluation. Work continued on developing an optimum synthesis route for ANTZDO. The creation of the thermochemical code CHEETAH represents a major accomplishment of the program. This code predicts the performance of energetic materials, specifically, high explosives, propellants and pyrotechnics, and reduces the number of tests necessary to develop a new material. General release of Cheetah 2.0 occurred to over 300 DoD, DOE and DoD contractor users. This version includes new chemical kinetics capability that allows for modeling of time-dependent phenomena, such as partial combustion and detonations in composite explosives. A suite of codes is under development for use in predicting the response of energetic materials in weapon systems subjected to thermal and mechanical insult. A first-ever truly predictive capability for cookoff has been developed composed of coupled thermal/mechanical/chemical codes for predicting when and where initiation occurs, along with shock physics tools for predicting the resulting violence of reaction. An experimental effort was initiated utilizing micro-impulse radar, a new diagnostic technique that measures the rate of disassembly of a test fixture, to determine the violence of cookoff response. These data will be used to evaluate and validate the simulation tools. The response of energetic materials to low strain rate deformations, where the mechanical properties of the materials control the energetic response, is also under investigation. A unique split- Hopkinson pressure bar facility was completed that allows for the measurement of the dynamic stress-strain response of soft materials such as polymers and explosives, and also permits sample temperature control from -55 to +55\u00b0 C. Measurements were completed on a variety of energetic materials and binders providing input for constitutive model development. The facility design was transitioned to the Navy at Indian Head where the Navy plans to replicate it. ($ 2.8 Million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense PE 0603225D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U)High Energy Density Materials (HEDM) are under development that would significantly increase the effectiveness of the next generation of compact munitions. Recent calculations suggest that solid compounds derived from first and second row elements can be stabilized in configurations that would exhibit significant energy content. This year proof-of-existence and recovery to atmospheric pressure was demonstrated for a family of novel high- nitrogen molecular materials generated using high-pressure techniques. A new material synthesized at the highest pressures appears to be composed of only single bonded nitrogen, while the material created at lower pressures appears to have a mixture of single and double bonded nitrogen. Both of these materials are recoverable to ambient pressure and appear quite stable. Calculations of higher order molecules of nitrogen indicate that these materials should be very energetic, having energies several times that of any known high explosive. Another new class of energetic materials, Metastable Intermolecular Composites (MIC), uses thermite chemistry and unique processing technology which provides uniform nano-scale metal particles to make lead-free energetic materials. These materials are appropriate for use in non-toxic percussion primers for small caliber ammunition and aircraft evacuation mechanisms (CAD/PAD systems) and as reactive warhead fills and performance-enhancing additives for solid rocket propellants. MIC fabrication was scaled up to tens of grams per day in the laboratory with additional extensions and enhancements identified that are expected to support the desired production capability of 1 kg/day. Performance evaluations on the materials continued and tests by both the Army and Navy demonstrated that MIC- based materials meet the current operational requirements for both ammunition primers and for CAD/PAD applications at both high and low temperatures. Transition activities are now supported under the Green Bullet Program sponsored by the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP). ($ 0.52 Million) (U)Lagrangian and Eulerian hydrocodes, coupled code systems, arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) codes, and supporting materials models and constitutive relations developed at the nuclear weapons laboratories have been improved and adapted to DoD problems and transitioned to the DoD user community for use in warhead design and evaluation. This program provides prompt and direct access to the substantial investments in computational mechanics and materials modeling by the DOE and acts as the conduit for transition. Specific activities supporting the technology transition include distribution of computational tools to the DoD community, support of DOE codes on centralized DoD computing systems, training of the user community, and consulting as needed. ($ 2.117 Million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Joint DoD/DOE Munitions PE 0603225D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U)A major thrust of this program is hard target defeat. A new concept for hard target weapons, the monolithic ballasted penetrator, has been developed that significantly increases velocity limits, penetration capability into concrete, and volume for energetic materials. Manufacturing and casting development studies were completed, and two sound prototype penetrators have been produced in ultra-high-strength AeroMet 100 steel. Gun testing at velocities between 3000 and 3500 fps is scheduled for next year. Small-scale experiments to establish scale effects, velocity limits and transition behavior for oblique and yawed impacts into rock targets were initiated. Tests at high velocity against concrete targets reveal angle-of-attack sensitivities that will challenge system designs and will be the focus of further analyses and experimentation. To address the problem of designing an explosive payload that will survive high velocity impact into rock and concrete, a mid-scale projectile loaded with an explosive formulation of TATB that is thermally stable and extremely insensitive, was jointly tested with the Navy against a concrete structure at 3000 fps. Both the penetrator and explosive survived the impact. In anti-armor tasks the Global Local Optimizer (GLO) code, a non-linear optimization tool used to drive hydrodynamic design codes, was used by warhead designers to optimize and fine-tune the performance of warheads. GLO represents a new and powerful tool for the design of complex multi-parameter warhead systems. It was used to design a munition to produce a particular size and shape of hole into concrete and for generating high-speed jets in a classified project. GLO is estimated to enhance the effectiveness of the designer approximately 10-fold. Relating warhead performance to material properties requires a detailed knowledge of material properties under dynamic conditions and is considered a fundamental issue in computationally based design of future weapon systems. Significant progress has been made in showing for the first time how impurity levels and grain size combine to affect the material behavior in shaped charge liners. ($ 2.816 Million) (U)DoD and DOE efforts toward munitions lifecycle technologies including stockpile aging, surveillance, demilitarization and disposal are coordinated under the auspices of this program. As the preferred method for demilitarization and disposal in DoD turns from open-burn and open-detonation to resource recycle and recovery, alternative technologies are required to turn waste materials into useful products. A successful demonstration was completed that utilized waste Explosive D available from demilitarization operations to form picramide, the starting material for synthesis of the insensitive explosive TATB, a high value product for both DoD and DOE. Scale-up efforts have been initiated and interested industrial partners have been identified for a pilot-plant demonstration. The potential for cutting explosives, both bare and encased in steel, has been demonstrated using a femtosecond laser. Unlike conventional cutting lasers that melt and vaporize material, the femtosecond laser ablates material with no evidence of heating. It offers unique capabilities for use in munitions demilitarization and manufacture. A laser testbed facility was established and cutting demonstrations completed on small components. To provide automated, remote capability for munitions demilitarization activities a robotic workcell for disassembling 155-mm projectiles was designed, prototyped, fabricated and is being assembled. When completed next year, it will provide the capability to completely disassemble M-483 rounds containing 88 bomblets. Age-related degradation of materials within high value weapon systems was studied in order to understand and predict changes in munitions safety, performance and reliability during long term storage. The current focus is on solder interconnect reliability, corrosion of electronics with an emphasis on plastic encapsulated microcircuits, and the aging of propellants. Predictive models for materials and system aging are under development to support stockpile management strategies and improve service-life estimates. ($ 1.99 Million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense (U)Improvement of electronic safing, arming and firing systems will continue with a focus on shock survivability for hard target penetrators, multi-point detonator arrays for aimable and target-adaptable warheads, and development of a micro firing system. Shock testing of ESAD components will be expanded to encompass simultaneous axial and lateral shock environments as defined from instrumented high velocity penetration tests. The initial evaluation of shock survivability will be completed on all of the critical ESAD components. Detonator testing across the range of required environmental conditions, including cold, temperature cycling and humidity, will be performed to evaluate long-term reliability of the low-energy chip slapper assemblies. An effort will be initiated to validate electrical models of multi-point detonator arrays and to understand the electrical current oscillations observed during array firings. The objective of the work is to develop more robust multi-point system designs and to reduce the sensitivities in detonator performance to manufacturing and design variations. Recent advances in microelectronics, micro-electromechanical systems, micro-lasers and optical initiation offer opportunities for increased operational capability in electronic firing systems along with a further order of magnitude decrease in size. Initial exploration of a next generation system will begin; feasibility will be established by demonstrating new components, new architectures and enhanced integration. To preserve and transition the advanced electronic initiation technology base developed under this program, a computerized knowledge base will be established on design, manufacture, test and surveillance. This classified tool will ensure experience retention in archives and support government laboratories and contractors. ($ 2.35 Million) (U)The development and characterization of new insensitive and new high-energy, high-power materials will continue with synthesis based on theoretical molecular design.

The investigation of sol-gel energetic materials will continue with a focus on their use in precision detonators and low-density gas generators. Formulations of a new family of smokeless energetics for possible exploitation in propellant applications will be explored. Release of CHEETAH 2.1 is planned which will contain an additional equation of state library with species calculated from first principles. The code is transitioning from an interpolative tool, calibrated to known explosives, to fully predictive. CHEETAH development will continue on equation of state for unreacted, partially reacted and fully reacted energetic materials, including non-ideal formulations, through modeling and carefully diagnosed experiments. Information will be input into subsequent CHEETAH updates and transitioned throughout the DoD community. Efforts to develop simulation tools for predicting munition system response to operational threat and accident environments will continue. A collaborative effort will be initiated with the Navy to experimentally assess and validate the just completed first-generation codes for predicting violence of reaction in cookoff accidents. Damage evolution and fracture behavior in energetic materials will be characterized using the new split- Hopkinson bar facility and scanning electron microscopy to support the development of energetic material constitutive models for use in the analyses of low strain rate mechanical deformation events.

The transition and support of these tools and models along with user training will be provided as needed. ($ 2.435 Million) (U)Half-scale prototypes of the monolithic ballasted penetrator will be tested at 3000-3500 fps into concrete targets to evaluate penetrator behavior and performance. Small and mid-scale experimental and computational studies will be extended with an emphasis on oblique impact and rock targets. Constitutive models of rock and soil will be evaluated and improved. The focus of these studies is on establishing system limits for high-velocity penetrators and on resolving differences in codes and models. Collaborative studies will be performed on an Air Force identified low-alloy steel that holds promise as a low-cost replacement for current ultra-high-strength steels being postulated for future high-velocity penetrators. The physical metallurgy will be evaluated to optimize chemical and processing variables. Payload survivability during high velocity impacts will be studied via microscopic analysis of the LX-17 explosive that was recovered from the joint test with Navy against a concrete target. Damage to the explosive, including gross material motion along with fracture, failure, and changes to the microstructure, will be evaluated and characterized. The use of multiple shaped charge jet impacts will be evaluated as a means for degrading concrete targets and increasing hard target penetrator performance. Application of the optimizer code GLO to complex warhead design problems, as a powerful extension of design efficiency and capability, will continue. GLO will be used to evaluate warhead designs for increased penetration capability against concrete structures and to continue the development of high-speed jet designs in support of a classified Army program. Exploration and demonstration of the highest speed shaped charge jets attainable will be pursued. The study of dynamic material properties will continue. Work will focus on understanding the role of processing on the dynamic behavior of shocked warhead liner materials, specifically addressing the importance of impurities and microstructure on liner performance.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT: (U) Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems improve the capabilities of our armed forces by enabling them to make better use of the information provided by military sensor systems such as radar, laser, infrared (IR), hyperspectral, identification friend or foe (IFF), and electronic signal measurement (ESM). ATR enhances the combat capabilities of our forces by increasing the lethality and survivability of our weapon systems and decreasing the time required to acquire and identify potential targets. ATR technology reduces our risk of fratricide by augmenting combat identification systems to improve our ability to distinguish between friend, foe, or neutral forces under high stress conditions. ATR technology provides significant workload reduction for the intelligence forces by aiding the image analyst to exploit imagery rapidly and accurately. In an era of decreasing military manpower, improved ATR will enable our forces to handle an ever increasing load of sensory information in the complex situations to be encountered in the military missions of the future. ATR capabilities are becoming essential to the Warfighter, as the Services pursue \"network-centric\" concepts for exploiting sensor imagery and information acquired through large arrays of sensors at all echelons. An OSD initiative, Smart SensorWeb (SSW), seeks to exploit this concept even further by providing greatly enhanced situational awareness for the Warfighter at the lower echelons, such as the battlefield commander. SSW will leverage on-going Service investments and will critically depend on application of ATR technology to achieve its goals. (U) Increasing ATR operational effectiveness requires research and development to enhance sensor performance and algorithmic image processing. Additionally, improved, more efficient procedures must be developed for measuring and demonstrating ATR effectiveness. This is very important as the utility of ATR is highly dependent on the quality of information provided by the sensor system(s) and the ability to process that information effectively to provide reliable decisions with operationally acceptable false alarm rates. Service and Agency ATR efforts have concentrated on algorithm development for conducting post- processing comparison and decision making which exploit improved digital computational capability. This program will focus on determining effectiveness of ATR, establishing benchmark metrics, and conducting and collecting single and multi-sensor data for potential reuse in Service and Agency algorithm developmentUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Automatic Target Recognition PE 0603232D8Z UNCLASSIFIEDand objective evaluation. Consistent with the 1997 report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on ATR, this program will establish standard tests and procedures to provide an \"honest broker\" assessment of current leading candidate ATR's, as well as emerging ATR technology for the next generation of ATR systems. (U) The ATR program funds the integration and demonstration of advanced technology for field experimentation and assessment. T he result of the ATR program efforts is the integration of the demonstrated technological capabilities and the capability to assess ATR algorithm performance. This leads to greatly improved understanding of the Joint Warfighting utility when assessed in realistic operational contexts. The Military Services provide air, land, and naval technological superiority, respectively, and ACTDs rapidly prototype and transition technological solutions to specific threat scenarios. This program provides timely resources and flexibility to horizontally integrate technology solutions across Services and Agencies and identify new and emerging \"best-in-class\" ATR systems with confidence so that this critical technology can be fielded more quickly.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS: (U) FY 1999 Accomplishments: (U) A Hyperspectral Technology Assessment Program (HTAP) was established to develop a framework for the quantitative characterization and utility of hyperspectral technology to DoD systems. During FY99, this effort reviewed various processing algorithms and applied them to canonic data sets. In addition, a system performance prediction model was developed. Another focus of the ATR Program was in the area of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for reconnaissance and surveillance. During FY99, the concept of Problem Sets was established wherein a comparative assessment of ATR algorithms for SAR data was designed and developed. This will enable the conduct of comparative testing against benchmark metrics for various mission scenarios. Techniques and metrics to quantitatively describe input image difficulty, or clutter, were formulated and are being developed. The ATR Program also initiated work in the area of optical correlators to assess their utility as an alternative to digital processing. The capabilities of the Virtual Distributed Laboratory (VDL) were improved using better query tools and encryption. FY99 also saw efforts directed towards transitioning ATR technology into existing service programs. Two efforts were initiated for ATR technology transition; the Sense and Destroy Armor (SADARM) fire-and-forget smart munition which would incorporate ATR technology for its LADAR upgrade and the Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System(LRAS3) which would use ATR technology for its IR sensor.

Standard metrics to describe ATR performance and associated problem sets will be adopted which cover surveillance, weapon and attack applications of ATR's. The Problem Set generation and ATR evaluation effort to determine \"best in class\" will be expanded to include more complex ATR functions such as scene analysis, and new sensor types to include hyperspectral and multi-mode sensors. These data sets will be distributed and made available via the VDL. A closer technical relationship will be established between the ATR and Hyperspectral communities, with increased emphasis on technology issues dealing with the assessment of Long Wavelength Infrared (LWIR) hyperspectral imaging for ATR.

A report will be issued comparing optical and digital correlator processing. The first Problem Sets will be delivered and used to evaluate ATR algorithms for SAR imagery, The Services' synthetic image generation capabilities will be applied to multi-spectral ATR's as a means assessing ATR performance over a wider range of operating conditions. During this time period more extensive subsystem technology effectiveness demonstrations will be conducted which support the transition efforts begun in FY99. These efforts will focus on the SADARM and LRAS3 initiatives begun in FY99. Modeling and simulation tasks will be conducted to provide software and hardware in the loop effectiveness analyses refine design requirements and manufacturing approaches. These models and simulations will be used to expand the range of tests and provide greater confidence in ATR field tests, which are limited in scope and duration, to facilitate transition to production programs. An assessment of hyperspectral performance and operational utility will continue as a basis for future investment decisions. The timing of these assessments will be consistent with the current schedules for ASRP flight demos and launches of Warfighter -1 and the Navy Earth Map Observer.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U)The Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) was established by Congress in 1990 (10 U.S.C. Section 2901-2904) to address Department of Defense ( DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) environmental concerns. It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia. SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness by providing new knowledge, cost-effective technologies, and demonstrations in the areas of environmental cleanup, compliance, conservation, and pollution prevention. SERDP does this by (1) addressing high priority, mission- relevant, defense environmental technology needs necessary to enhance military operations, improve military systems` effectiveness, enhance military training/readiness, and help ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents; and (2) enhancing pollution prevention capabilities to reduce operational and life-cycle costs, as well as reducing the cost of necessary cleanup actions and compliance with laws and regulations. As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems. The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively to these priority defense needs; the pursuit of universal, world-class technical excellence; emphasis on constant technology transfer to field use; and sound fiscal management.

In FY 1999, this project finalized data on in-flight ullage conditions and completed the development of test methodologies on the toxicity, environmental impact, materials compatibility, and principal degradation products. ($ 4.220 Million) (U)(2) Elimination and Reduction of Air Emissions : Ten projects focus on reducing or eliminating hazardous air emissions in the form of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), oxides of nitrogen ( NOx) and particulates. These projects range from reformulations of sealants, primers, adhesives and coatings to improved, non-hazardous solvents. A baseline evaluation of Room Temperature Vulcanizing (RTV) silicone formation was developed to assess physical adhesion properties and surface analysis for a replacement of a currently high VOC silane primer. A trapped vortex combustor is showing promise to reduce emissions and conserve fuel. Reduction of VOCs and elimination of hazardous air pollutants and toxic solvents has been demonstrated by a low VOC chemical agent resistant coating system. ($ 6.414 Million) (U) (3) `Green Energetics`: Four projects are designed to reduce the environmental impact of explosives and propellants. They span from the reformulation of small caliber ammunition to eliminate the lead, to the elimination of hazardous material from propellants and explosives. Successes include: 1) a cylindrical Magnetron Sputtering Process that replaces the aqueous electrodeposition process using hexavalent chrome, a known carcinogen; 2) a non-lead propellant that was successfully tested in a rocket motor case; and 3) over 800 thousand `green` bullets passed Lot Acceptance Test at Lake City Army Ammunition plant. ($ 3.714 Million) (U)(4) Elimination of Chromium : Chromium is used extensively in both coatings and sealants due to its corrosion protection and durability. However, hexavalent chromium is a carcinogen and creates an environmental hazard. Three projects, dedicated to the elimination of chromium in a variety of applications from hard chrome plating to sealants, adhesives, and coatings were started in FY99. Research spans from elucidating basic mechanisms to reformulations of products to eliminate the chromium. The most promising Sol-Gel chemistry for Aluminum, Titanium, and steel alloys were identified. ($ 2.134 Million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E/Defense-Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program PE 0603716D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U)(5) Elimination or Reduction of Hazardous Materials : The handling and disposal of hazardous materials is a costly and time-consuming process. Six projects are designed to eliminate or reduce the production of hazardous materials in the operation and maintenance of weapons systems. Technologies, such as new depainting and stripping processes, extraction and recycling, can radically reduce the volume of hazardous materials. Development of non- hazardous substitute materials, which perform equal to or better than the original, is another focus of these projects. Two projects were completed in FY99 in this subthrust. An inert supercritical fluid solvent allows for the extraction and recycling of propellent. A precision targeting process provides a standarized procedure for comparative risk reduction associated with pesticides. ($ 2.717 Million) (U) Cleanup : There are 5 high priority areas within cleanup thrust area. This includes four National Environmental Technology Test Sites (NETTS) which facilitate the demonstration and validation of technologies prior to commercialization. (U)(1) Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) Detection : Eight projects aim to improve UXO detection capability, which is the highest priority within the SERDP Cleanup Technology Thrust Area. Efforts focused on development and integration of multi-sensors and data fusion software for the location, identification, discrimination, and delineation of UXOs. In FY 1999, three new efforts were initiated to address innovative UXO discrimination techniques. Phenomenological modeling and development of single-sensor signal processing algorithms to identify which type of detection sensors were successfully developed to identify buried UXO. These models are capable of modeling EMI, radar, and seismic responses from objects with arbitrary shape and orientation in arbitrary, multi-layered environments. The results of the modeling will be used in developing optimal detectors to identify UXO at DoD sites. Harmonic radar was shown capable to remotely detect and locate surface and shallow-buried UXO. A new data analysis system ( i.e, data fussion), completed this year, reduces target analysis time by up to 50 percent. ($ 4.139 Million) (U)(2) Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL) Detection and Remediation (non-bio) : DNAPLs are among the most difficult materials to detect in the subsurface and remediate. They are a common contaminant at almost every DoD site due to their widespread use as cleaning solvents. Seven projects are focused on phycio-chemical remediation techniques. All biological remediation projects are covered under the bioremediation subthrust. Source removal, real-time detection using negative ion sensors, geophysical sensors, barriers, and tracer tests are the foci of the non-bio DNAPL detection and remediation projects subthrust. ($ 4.308 Million) (U)(3) Risk Assessment and Standards : One of the most pressing issues in cleanup is `how clean is clean`. To determine this, four projects are focusing on the risks to humans, animals, plants and ecosystems associated with military compound. During FY 99 dose-response information was generated using genosensors and conducting whole-organism bioassays for such military-relevant compounds such as explosives (TNT, RDX, HMX), other organics (PCB/PAH), and metals ( Pb). Preliminary results indicate relatively low whole organism toxicity for RDX and HMX in comparison to the TNT degradation products TNB and DANT.

($ 5.542 Million) (U)(2) Demilitarization and Deconstruction of Conventional Weapons : Two continuing projects develop environmentally benign processes for the destruction of explosives in conventional weapons. One involves the use of enzymes to degrade energetic materials and the other uses hypergolic chemical which neutralizes the energetic materials and precludes a detonation. Results indicate that organic amines react with TNT, RDX and Composition B at low temperatures leading to the safe breakdown of the explosive material without detonation. Two patents, one for `Combined Enzymatic and Microbial Method for Destruction of Explosives,` and another for `Method for Transformation of Nitroaromatics by Redox Enzyme` were submitted. ($ 0.921 Million) (U)(3) Characterization and Treatment of Waters and Sludges : Five projects address the characterization and treatment of waters and sludges. One project was completed in FY99 and resulted in reaction models based on newly developed oxidation rates for common organic compounds in supercritical water. Technologies being developed include: electrochemical advanced oxidation, nanofiltration membranes, thermal controls, and biodegradation. These technologies are applied to shipboard wastes, oil/water separators, combustors, bioreactors, SCWO reactor skids, and other prototype water and sludge treatment units.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT: (U) In May 1998 the Secretary of Defense appointed Commander-in-Chief, United States Joint Forces Command, the Defense Department's Executive Agent for Joint Experimentation (JE). Subsequently, the Department realigned resources to support the Joint Forces Command's (JFCOM ) new role. FY 1999 funding from this Program Element was redirected to support the initial stand-up of JFCOM's Joint Experimentation Directorate. Funding to support the Joint Advanced Warfighting Program concept development, the digital network infrastructure, and technology feeder support for joint experimentation was retained in this Program (PE). Program Element 0603727N has been established to fund JFCOM JE efforts in FY 2000 and beyond. Consequently, FY 1999 accomplishments in this exhibit include JFCOM's activities. (U) The Joint Warfighting PE supports three related activities: the Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP), the Information Technology Backbone (ITB), and technology feeder support for joint experimentation. While these activities strongly support JFCOM's joint experimentation efforts, a separate program element has been retained since the activities support other organizations in addition to JFCOM, and require a degree of independence from JFCOM to function as envisioned. (U) The JAWP was established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense ( OSD), with the support of the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, to serve as a catalyst for innovation and change. This program's focus is on assisting in the formulation and assessment of advanced concepts and capabilities, plus identifying enabling technologies and integration options for the Department. These concepts drive changes in the doctrine,UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Joint Warfighting 0603727D8Z UNCLASSIFIEDorganization, training and education, materiel and leadership (DOTML) of the Services. The JAWP serves a key role in identifying, exploring and evaluating breakthrough warfighting capabilities. It builds on the lessons learned from earlier Service experiments that have underscored the importance of having a firm conceptual basis upon which to build experiments. The JAWP concentrates on joint instead of Service unique revolutionary concepts. In identifying and elaborating innovative joint concepts and capabilities, and associated enabling technologies, the JAWP not only takes into account Service efforts but also those of the CINCs and Defense Agencies. The JAWP promotes integration and conducts experiments and assists in their implementation. The JAWP's work complements and supports the activities of JFCOM , the Joint Staff, and the OSD. It provides an independent source for formulating advanced concept candidates for joint experimentation. The JAWP is composed of both civilian analysts and technologists, and the JAWP Analytical Project Office (JAWP-APO) , a jointly manned activity established by the Deputy Secretary of Defense consisting of military operators from the four Services . (U) The Information Technology Backplane provides an advanced network infrastructure that extends commercial capabilities to provide capabilities needed to meet Joint Vision (JV) 2010 needs. Information Superiority is a key JV 2010 building block and the ITB provides the means to experiment with the digital transmission capabilities that will be available in five years. The ITB is not a new physical network. It is a virtual network that capitalizes on existing physical networks such as the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN), the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)-Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Leading Edge Services Network, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and the experimental Advance Technology Demonstration (ATD) net. The ITB has many users from sites served by existing networks but the funding included in this PE is the incremental funding needed to support joint experimentation. For example, this PE provides the circuit costs to extend the ITB from the experimentation site to the nearest point on the backplane (where no other network exists), and only the \"extra\" backplane costs generated by the Joint Warfighting Experiments. Since joint experiments are very dependent on advanced distributed simulation, or on limited live command post exercises that are being driven by simulations, a robust network is needed to interconnect the various sites. Often times, these simulations press the state of the art in networking capability, including that of requiring Type-I encryption for protected communications. The ITB also supports new bandwidth intensive applications such as video teleconferencing and high definition television. (U) The third effort supported by this PE is technology feeder support for joint experi ments. There are many technology demonstrations, advanced technology demonstrations, and advanced concept and technology demonstrations that can provide advanced technologies to support joint experiments. This effort provides technology managers the resources to expand the scope of a test or demonstration to collect data for the joint staff or JFCOM, thereby leveraging the OSD and Service Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations (ACTD) investment.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Joint Experimentation: FY 1999 funds were transferred to JFCOM is support the following efforts: ($10.260) (U) JFCOM's FY 1999 objectives were presented in its Joint Experimentation Campaign Plan 99 (CPLAN 99). The Campaign Plan provides a methodology for laying out a strategy and schedule for FY 1999 experiments. CPLAN 99 provided the context for the Joint Experimentation program and for developing the experimentation strategy for each identified future Joint Warfighting concept. The concept of a Joint Experiment program to address future military challenges and the concurrent necessity for Joint interoperability is unique and never before examined through a comprehensive approach. Therefore, a central theme of CPLAN 99 was \"proof of process\" which described the validation of the Joint Experimentation process and proof of the sufficiency of the JFCOM organization which has been established to implement this process. This \"proof of process\" strategy has allowed for implementation of an institutionalized approach which can support analysis and implementation of a diverse range of concepts, validation of the approach and the ability to rapidly re-focus efforts from the process to the content of the Joint Experimentation plan. CPLAN 99, the first campaign plan, has permitted benchmarking the experimentation processes which JFCOM will conduct with costing estimates established using historical Service metrics and previous experience. The concepts selected for experimentation allowed the program to establish links with other DoD wide and individual Military Service experimentation activities thereby optimizing resource allocation through integration and leveraging ongoing activities. The program of experimentation set forth by approval of CPLAN 99 structured the JFCOM Joint Experimentation organization around investigating and developing new concepts and military capabilities. Joint Experimentation differs from other RDT&E and acquisition efforts in that it is concept based instead of deficiency based. The concepts which have been selected for experimentation directly support the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Vision 2010 Implementation Master Plan and the Revolution in Military Affairs for 2010 and beyond. These concepts reflect the tenets and key points articulated in the RMA and address future, emerging military challenges. These experimentation efforts will support the Joint Warfighter across the full spectrum of military operational environments. Joint Experimentation at JFCOM seeks to identify and narrow redundancies and harmonize the experimentation efforts of the Services, non-DoD agencies and industry. (U) In FY 1999 JFCOM has sponsored a Futures Program. The Futures Program explored and will continue to examine future DOTML-P issues by reviewing emerging technologies and concepts and by bringing together warfighters, futurists, academics, and industry. Additionally,UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Joint Warfighting PE 0603727D8Z UNCLASSIFIEDthe Futures Program explored and continues to explore the use of wargames, modeling and simulation and virtual environments in developing future concepts for experimentation. J9901 and the Futures Program also leverages the existing Information Technology (IT) Backplane to conduct experiments. However, it is anticipated that robust experimentation will require continued development of the existing IT Backplane capabilities. The Futures Programs has focused on identifying Future Operational Capabilities (FOCs) critical to Joint Warfighting. These FOCs are the product of a series of Futures Seminars, Concepts Development Workshops and Senior Warfighter Reviews consisting of OSD, Joint Staff, Services and Component Commanders that were sponsored and executed by JFCOM starting in October 1999. Conferences and workshops have been attended by individual Service Battle Laboratory representatives, the Joint Staff, Unified CINCs and OSD who have nominated future warfighting experiments and cooperative approaches to support future experimentation partnerships. To date JFCOM has identified 10 concepts scheduled for experimentation starting in FY 1999 and continuing into FY 2000. These concepts are being evaluated in JFCOM generated experiments or will leverage ongoing services, demonstrations/experiments, ACTDs, ATDs and JT&Es. They will include experiments which evaluate the following Future Operational Concepts (FOCs): Rapid Decisive Operations (RDO), Attack Operations Against Critical Mobile Targets, Joint Interactive Planning, Focused Logistics: Enabling Early Decisive Operations, Command Relevant Operational Picture, Adaptive Joint C2, Surveillance and Fires From Space, Information Operations, Forcible Entry Operations and Strategic Deployment. These ten concepts form the basis of the experimentation process JFCOM initiated in October 1998. As a result of this activity, CINC USJFCOM has designated Rapid Decisive Operations as the key, overarching concept. The other nine currently identified concepts are supportive of RDO. This action is reflected in the SECDEF's Defense Planning Guidance. This effort has also supported the independent assessment of the Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP). The results from the OSD sponsored JAWP have been integrated into the overarching JFCOM Joint Experimentation program. (U) Joint Warfighting Attack Operations Experiment - FY 1999 funds were transferred to JFCOM is support the following effort: ($15.900 million) (U) The JFCOM Joint Experimentation Implementation Plan (I-Plan) dated 14 July 1998 is CINC USJFCOM's concept and plan for executing the SECDEF Charter for Joint Experimentation. It establishes the experimentation process and described how JFCOM will organize to accomplish the mission. Leveraging existing resources and work accomplished by the Joint Staff and Joint Warfighting Center, JFCOM's FY 1999 experimentation focus was to test and subsequently refine the \"Proof of Process\" envisioned for the experimentation process by designing J9901 Attack Operations Against Critical Mobile Targets (AOACMT) to evaluate this Future Operational Concept. J9901 tested emerging concepts and joint doctrine by utilizing advanced simulations, virtual environments, and wargames. J9901 took advantage of resources developed in the Synthetic Theater of War (STOW) ACTD to support a Virtual Attack Operations situation. The success of J9901 allowed the program toUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Joint Warfighting PE 0603727D8Z UNCLASSIFIEDpursue experimentation objectives focused upon the future (2015) such as Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Command and Control (C2), Weapons Systems, Red Teaming and Future Threats. (U) In FY 1999, JFCOM conducted the first experimentation event for AOACMT. The initial venue for experimenting on this concept was through advanced simulation. During subsequent experimentation events, simulations of increasing complexity will be used culminating in live field events or experiments merged with simulations. This first phase focused on assessing the relationships between potential 2015 intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) technologies, dynamic tasking, and advanced precision engagement systems. The target set consisted of mobile theater ballistic missiles and launchers. Phase 2 will culminate in a simulation-based experiment that will add an advanced mobile air defense system to the target array and signal intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities to the ISR grid. Phase 3, in FY 2001 will expand human intelligence (HUMINT) and Information Operations (IO) to the joint force capabilities in the experiment. Each phase will also include several leveraged events, among which will be Roving Sands, Fleet Battle Experiments, Army Advanced Warfighting Experiments, Air Force Joint Expeditionary Force Experiments (JEFXs), Joint Test & Evaluations (JT&Es), advanced concept technology demonstrations (ACTDs) and work done on command, control, communications, and computers (C4)ISR by the Joint C4ISR Battle Center. (U) Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (U) The Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP) was established in April 1998. The JAWP-APO was established in January 1999 and fully manned with active duty military personnel in September 1999. Working for the OSD, the Joint Staff, JFCOM and their subordinate activities in support of JWE, the JAWP has: (1) identified key elements of a joint experimentation process; (2) developed candidate advanced concepts for joint experimentation including the Rapid Decisive Operations (RDO ) concept which serves as the integrator for all JFCOM concepts ; (3) developed , organized and conducted an attack operations experiment , JFCOM 's first major FY 1999 experiment (J9901) ; (4) developed prototype experimentation plans; (5) conducted research and seminars to classify works on future operational concepts and future security environments that are relevant to joint experimentation; and (6) planned for and conducted seminars and workshops with other government organizations to identify complimentary and supporting technology programs and activities. ($4.545 M illion) (U) Information Technology Backplane (U) The Information Technology Backplane was expanded and network services and equipment provided to JFCOM. In the network security area, work continued on the authentication system for ATM switch management. In particular, efforts to provide authentication into the wide- spread Simple Network Management Protocol Version 3 (SNMP-V3) began and proposals were advanced through international standards bodiesUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Joint Warfighting 0603727D8Z as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The ITB also served as a NSA alpha and beta test site for cryptographic testing (specifically the KG-75 Release 3 FASTLANE). NRL received a small number of KG-75 Release 3 FASTLANEs as pre-certified versions and began testing the device for network functionality. The results of this initial testing were exchanged with NSA and the FASTLANE vendor, and incorporated in newer versions of the firmware. In the area of ATM applications, work in workstation voice-over-data began. This capability will allow users of a standards based workstation to conduct voice calls using the microphone and speakers attached to the computer. Work continued on tools to exercise network devices, to assist in lab bench testing, live network testing, and network monitoring. A significant part of the ITB effort provided support to JFCOM. Circuits and network management provided between JFCOM, IDA, the Joint Advanced Warfighting Program, and Naval Research Lab (NRL) were continued. Since NRL is a physical hub, network access to other Defense Research and Engineering Network sites such as Space and Naval Warfare Center, Army Research Lab, and etc., were leveraged without cost to this program. JFCOM was also provided a distributed file system node capable of accessing high-end computing resources and sharing files across the High Performance Computing Office of the Director, Defense Research and Engineering. Work began on providing JFCOM high-performance remote access to advanced image analysis tools and databases. Coordination will begin with appropriate OSD ACTD managers and service activities such as U.S.Army-Communications - Electronic Command (CECOM) and U.S. Air Force-Rome Labs to define the network architecture for JFCOM's Joint Contingency Force Experiment in FY 2000. ($1.719 Million) (U) Experimentation Feeder Support (U) The Experimentation Feeder Support task directly supported JFCOM's FY 1999 experiments, a combat identification experiment, and a joint staff study. The Synthetic Theater of War (STOW) ACTD provided the virtual simulation infrastructure for JFCOM's Joint Attack of Critical Mobile Targets Experiment (J9901). Modifications were made to STOW to simulate sensors and weapons in the 2015 timeframe. By having a man-in-the-loop the experiment was able to explore the ability of humans to manage new concepts, investigate new tactics, techniques, and procedures, and to help discover \"what could be\" by closely linking new technology and concepts. JFCOM also supported the virtual modeling of Joint Surveillance & Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), a Rivet Joint simulator, and Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) experimentation. Support was provided to the Combat Identification ACTD to support their participation in the All Service Combat Identification Evaluation Team's (ASCIET) FY 1999 exercise. JFCOM's interest was in the joint and coalition aspects of this experiment. The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) is considering the Single-Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) SIP+ radio as a potential combat identification solution because it will provide joint and coalition interoperability due to the large density of SINCGARS and SINCGARS compatible radios. In ASCIET 99 testing included an Army helicopter, USMC ground forces, and a coalition force. The Joint Staff recognized the need to integrate the processes associated with doctrine, organization, training and education, material, leadership, and people (DOTLMP).UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Joint Warfighting PE 0603727D8Z UNCLASSIFIEDWhile the processes for changing material are well understood, the other five considerations for military capability are not well synchronized with the introduction of new technology. This analysis will define and information processing and dissemination systems to collect, coordinate, and provide information to DOD senior decision makers. ($1.619M) (U) FY 2000 Plans: (U) Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (U) The Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP) will continue its support of JV2010 implementation and the Joint Experimentation work in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, and the JFCOM and subordinate elements. Efforts will be both on front-end identification and elaboration of concepts and capabilities, plus support for the conduct of experiments. It will mature the Attack Operations concept and expand on the experience s and lessons learned during JFCOM 's J9901 experiment , which would include the addition of Joint Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (JSEAD) operations , expanded command and control applications and a more robust sensor suite . It will continue to develop and refine candidate advanced warfighting concepts and capabilities using wargames, and modeling and simulation. It will identify promising and enabling technologies. It will collect and analyze data to support the formulation of the Department's overall Joint Experimentation efforts. The JAWP will continue to evaluate these concepts and systems through simulation, wargaming and analysis. The JAWP will help in the construct, design and conduct of joint warfighting experiments in three specific areas: command and control, logistics, and joint force employment . It will also participate in other experiments during the year that support advanced joint warfighting. The JAWP will look specifically at the Revolution in Military Affairs to analyze the impact of revolutionary technological concepts on doctrine and investment strategies. Workshops, seminars and conferences will be held in conjunction with JFCOM and the National Defense University to inform the discussions and shape the debate on future concepts and exercises. It will conduct vulnerability assessments using \"Red Teaming\" techniques to identify weaknesses and avoid surprises. It will use the transparent wargaming approach, which it developed to assist in the conduct of J9901 and other experiments . Transformation will also be a key focus. The JAWP will begin to identify programs, systems and methods to improve and expedite the process of executing and implementing the recommended changes, which result from the joint experimentation process and the development of new technological capabilities. Included in these latter activities, the JAWP will evaluate the systems and products developed in Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration s (ACTDs) for use in the Department's overall joint experimentation program. As appropriate it will use available modeling and simulation (M&S). The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office will oversee the JAWP M&S activities to insure that they are consistent with department policy and the DOD High Level Architecture for simulations. ($4.000 M illion)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Information Technology Backplane (V) The ITB will continue to be upgraded to reflect emerging protocols that show promise from advanced research network testbeds. In the area of network management, Kerberos authentication will be extended into Simple Network Management Protocol Version 3 (SNMPv3) and interoperability with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) protocols will be started. In the area of applications, the capability for a workstation voice user to communicate with a standard handset voice user will be started. The image analysis tool, DIEPS, will be extended across the ITB to selected sites (such as JFCOM). This will allow remote users the ability to have interaction similar to those who run DIEPS locally. Network testing of the KG-75 Release 3 FASTLANE will continue and initial pre-certification versions of the KG-175 TACLANE are expected. These units will be tested (with NSA's concurrence) to ensure network interoperability. Results will be fed back to NSA and the vendor for incorporation prior to final certification. Efforts in support of JFCOM will continue, focusing on assisting in the development of a local infrastructure to extend the ITB to multiple sites/users within JFCOM. Connectivity to key sites (JFCOM, IDA, etc.) will continue with selected circuits upgraded to 155Mbs and possibly 622Mbs (as warranted). This will enable experimentation with \"killer applications\" such as High Definition Television (HDTV), which produces data at gigabit per second rates. Lower bandwidth (10's of Mbps), high quality HDTV receiver systems will be tested and installed at critical sites. HDTV provides mission planners and commanders the ability to observe real-time or near- real-time temporally meaningful data. Upgrades to critical network components of the ITB (such as KG-75 Release 3 FASTLANEs) will occur. ($1.400 Million) (U) Experimentation Feeder Support (U) Experimentation Feeder Support: Plans to utilize several current and planned ACTDs to support joint experimentation objectives will be completed as well as the Joint Staff DOTMLP study. The JFCOM IPT responsible for the Attack Operations Against Critical Mobile Targets (AOCMT) concept will finalize plans for the use of the Extending the Littoral Battlefield (ELB) and Joint Continuous Strike Environment (JCSE) ACTDs to support continued experimentation. JFCOM will also complete an analysis, which will be incorporated in their Campaign Plan for FY 2001, of all ACTDs including the newly selected FY 2000 ACTDs to determine how they can be used to support other experimental concepts. This specifically includes PACOM sponsored ACTDs such as Adaptive Course of Action (ACOA) and other PACOM experimentation activities coordinated with JFCOM.

The focus will be on increased involvement in additional Service/joint exercises and the JFCOMs Joint Experimentation activities, with emphasis on advancing the understanding of specific concepts and in conducting experimentation. Opportunities will be identified to leverage and integrate Service and other agency programs, as well as activities such as Advanced Technology Demonstrations and Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations. Data collection and independent analysis will be conducted and used to produce reports and papers intended to inform the OSD, Joint Staff and JFCOM leadership of experimentation results and to make recommendations for future activities. In addition, the JAWP will identify breakthrough concepts and technologies that could produce revolutionary future warfighting capabilities. Vulnerability assessments and \"Red Teaming\" will be conducted to improve the validity and robustness of experimentation. A major effort during the fiscal year will be a focus on the transformation process. The JAWP will work on the identification of vehicles and opportunities that can be used in the early transition of new concepts and technologies in to actual operational military capabilities. ($4.000 Million) (U) Information Technology Backplane (U) The Information Technology Backplane (ITB) ongoing task of transitioning emerging technology from advanced research network testbeds will continue. Implementation of more secure ( Kerberized) network management protocols (SNMP) across the entire ITB is expected. Kerberos/Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) interoperability will begin to be tested on selected ITB sites. Work on transitioning switch-partitioning prototypes will begin at selected ITB sites. (This technology will allow physical switching elements to be partitioned into logical \" subswitches\" which will give virtual networks (such as the ITB) strict resource control over a shared network backbone.) Distributed applications, such as the image analysis tool, DIEPS, will be continue. Efforts in support of JFCOM will continue. Connectivity to key sites (JFCOM, IDA, etc.) will continue with selected circuits upgraded as required.

Through FY 1998, the program was managed by the Veterans Administration. In accordance with the FY 1999 Defense Authorization Bill (H.R. 3616, Sec. 244), the Department of Defense now guides investment of these funds as executive agent, acting through the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command and the Naval Operational Medicine Institute. Coordination with the VA on research topics ensures that the program benefits the health of both active military forces and veterans. Research proposals are solicited from in-house DoD and VA investigators, and projects are selected for funding based on technical merit and relevance to the solicitation. Technical merit is determined through independent peer review by experts outside the DoD and VA. Projects are selected through independent peer review by intramural VA and DoD physicians and scientists. Funds support a `core` or general research program of cooperative medical research in topics such as emerging infectious diseases, trauma, stress, and exercise physiology.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT : The Department of Defense (DoD) recognizes the need to rapidly develop and field new technological capabilities, and to explore new and innovative operational and organizational concepts associated with those capabilities. Such advances are critical to the objective of achieving a \"revolution in military affairs\" to support the Chairman's Joint Vision 2010 . Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations (ACTDs) are low risk vehicles for pursuing that objective. ACTDs are capability demonstration and evaluation programs in which the development and employment of technology and innovative, operational concepts by the military user are the primary focus. The demonstrations involve a material development organization that develops the technology, and a warfighting organization responsible for assessing the military utility. In addition to stimulating innovation, ACTDs offer three other significant opportunities. They provide experienced combat commanders with an opportunity to develop operational concepts and operational requirements to fully exploit the capabilities being evaluated. They allow the users an opportunity to assess the military utility of the proposed capability prior to a major acquisition decision. They also provide the Services with a mechanism for compressing acquisition cycle time, thus significantly improving their response to priority operational needs. As such, ACTDs are at the foundation of the DoD acquisition reform process. They do not substitute for formal DoD acquisition procedures, but do accelerate these procedures for technologies, which are deemed by the applicable combatant commands to have demonstrated military utility. In FY 1999, ACTDs also became an integral part of the Joint Warfighter Experimentation process. U.S. Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) Joint Experimentation Plan 00 identified ten ACTDs to be evaluated during Millennium Challenge, the major, all-Service joint experiment planned for FY 2000. The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Advance Systems and Concepts) (DUSD (AS&C)) worked closely with JFCOM to prepare Campaign Plan 01 in order to insure ACTDs integrate technology and develop new concepts of operation to fully leverage with and integrate into future joint experiments. (U) The Military Departments and Defense Agencies provide most of the funding (80-90 percent) for ACTDs. This demonstrates significant Service/Agency commitment to the ACTD. Funding from this program element is used: 1) to support actual demonstrations and exercises, 2) to provide hardware to demonstrate military utility, and 3) to fund interim capability operations and support for up to two years after the operational demonstration phase of the ACTD. This two-year phase provides the Service, Agency, and operators with adequate time to continue to address the issues of supportability, maintainability and training identified by the ACTD.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) Date: February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide/BA 3R-1 PE 0603750D 03/09/00 8:33 AM UNCLASSIFIED(U) Both the Science and Technology (S&T) and the warfighter communities submit candidate ACTDs in January of each year. The candidates proposed by the S&T community reflect technological opportunities enabled by recently demonstrated technology. The candidates proposed by the warfighter community (Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), Unified Commanders in Chief (CINCs) and Service operational organizations) respond to a deficiency in military capability or to an emerging military need. For each candidate, it is necessary to confirm that the proposed concept is based on technology that is sufficiently mature, and that the capability addresses a priority military need. (U) The maturity of the technology associated with the proposed capability is assessed by the DUSD (AS&C), with assistance of senior members of th e science and technology community (known as the Breakfast Club). The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) prioritizes the ACTD candidates by military need. The principal management tools for the ACTD are the Implementation Directive and Management Plan. Each approved ACTD will be described in top-level documents that provide details of the demonstration/evaluation, the main objectives, approach, critical events, measures of success, transition options, participants, schedule, and funding. Each ACTD receives considerable review and oversight at high levels within the Department. (U) The typical timeline of two-to-four years for the operational demonstration phase of an ACTD is compressed compared to normal timelines for fielding an operational capability. These shorter schedules are made possible because ACTDs incorporate mature or nearly mature technology and, therefore, forgo time consuming technology development and technical risk reduction activities. At the end of the ACTD, the user sponsor is able to determine if the capability provided by current technology has sufficient utility to warrant procurement. If there are significant shortcomings, their options are to either pursue an advanced technology demonstration to improve performance, or not pursue the technology any further at this time. In cases where the operational user is satisfied the prototype has significant utility, the prototype can be used as an interim capability. The Department then moves quickly to enter the formal acquisition process and to acquire needed quantities. (U) The request for FY 2001 candidate ACTDs was issued October 1999. Proposals were received from the CINCs, Services, other DoD Agencies, and industry in January 2000. Candidates are organized into the Joint Vision 2010 operational concepts of Dominant Maneuver, Precision Engagement, Full Dimensional Protection and Focused Logistics. Plans are being finalized with the Joint Staff to begin the process of reviewing the candidates for FY 2001 ACTDs in February/March 2000. Funding for FY 2001 ACTDs is approximately $14.0 million.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET Exhibit) Date: February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide/BA 3R-1 PE 0603750D 03/09/00 8:33 AM UNCLASSIFIED(U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS : (U) FY 1999 Accomplishments : All ACTDs initiated in FYs 1995 through 1999 have been reviewed for objectives, content and management. This includes in-depth review by some of the ACTD operational sponsors such as U. S. Joint Forces Command (JFCOM). There were several general, notable achievements for ACTDs in 1999. Approximately twenty percent of all ACTDs were deployed, or requested for deployment, to Operation Allied Force. Some remain in theater as part of Kosovo peacekeeping operations. In addition, two ACTDs received national-level recognition awards for excellence: Link-16 won the Microsoft Windows Worldwide Open Product of the Year Award and Air Base/Port Biological Detection won the David Packard Excellence for Acquisition Program Management Award. Eleven new ACTDs were started in FY 1999: Battle Damage Assessment in Joint Targeting Toolbox, Coherent Analytical Computing Environment, Common Spectral MASINT Exploitation, Compact Environmental Anomaly Sensor II, Force Medical Protection/ Dosimeter, Human Intelligence and Counterintelligence Support Tools, Joint Medical Operations - Telemedicine, Joint Theater Logistics, Personnel Recovery Mission Software, Small Unit Logistics and Theater Air and Missile Defense Interoperability. The selection process for FY 2000 ACTDs began early in FY 1999. Twelve final ACTD candidates, of the forty received from the Unified Commands, the Services and Defense agencies, were considered for final selection. Candidates cover a broad range of technologies and needs, including: intelligence, reconnaissance, surveillance, information technology and security, satellite protection, targeting enhancement, communications and crisis planning and management. These candidates were evaluated for technical maturity by the Breakfast Club and for operational need and utility by the Joint Staff Joint Warfare Capability Assessment (JWCA) process. The JROC then prioritized these 12 candidates and eleven were finally selected based upon funding availablity. FY 1999 funds were transferred to the executing services/agencies in the amount of $80.281 million. (U) 1999 accomplishments include: FY 1995 Starts: Advanced Joint Planning (AJP): Continued interim capability support and hardening of products for transition to GCCS. High Altitude Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (HAE-UAV): The Global Hawk unmanned air vehicle has completed air worthiness and sensor payload test flights, commenced operational field demonstrations, exercises, and possible contingency deployments, enabling early user involvement to evaluate military utility.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT: (U) The Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computing (HPC) Modernization Program (HPCMP) directly supports the needs of the warfighter for technological superiority and military dominance on the battlefield by providing the highest computational power available to U.S. weapons system scientists and engineers. By exploiting continuous advances in high performance computing technology, the defense research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) community is able to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems quicker and with more precision than any potential adversary threatening national security. The results of these efforts feed directly into the acquisition process by increasing our fundamental understanding of the battlefield environment as well as improving upon weapon system design, development, test, evaluation, deployment, operations and sustainment. As such, high performance computing (HPC) has been identified as a key enabling technology essential to achieving the objectives of the DoD's Science and Technology (S&T) and Test and Evaluation (T&E) programs.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-Wide / BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE High Performance Computing Modernization PE 0603755D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U) The HPCMP has established and supports four major shared resource supercom puting centers as well as several smaller, special-purpose distributed supercomputing centers. These centers directly support the DoD S&T and T&E laboratories and centers and are accessible to local and remote scientists and engineers via high-speed network access. Providing for the adaptation of broadband, widely-used applications and algorithms to address S&T and T&E requirements, along with continued training of users as new system designs and concepts evolve, is an integral part of the program. The program pursues continuous interaction with the national HPC infrastructure, including academe, industry, and other government agencies to facilitate the sharing of knowledge, tools, and expertise. (U) The HPCMP user base includes approximately 5,000 computational scientists and engineers and over 60 DoD laboratories and developmental test and evaluation facilities. The integrated HPCM program consists of a set of four large Major Shared Resources Centers (MSRCs) that are responsible for as large a fraction of DoD's S&T and DT&E computational workload as feasible. These MSRCs provide extensive capabilities to address user requirements for hardware, software, programming environments, and training. A limited set of smaller shared resource centers, Distributed Centers (DCs), augment the MSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability. Distributed Centers address critical HPC requirements that cannot be met at MSRCs, such as real-time, and near real-time computing requirements, and leverage significant HPC expertise located at the remote sites. The MSRCs and DCs are currently interconnected with all S&T and DT&E user sites via the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN). Additionally the Common HPC Software Support Initiative (CHSSI) develops a set of critical common DoD applications programs that run efficiently on advanced HPC systems at the MSRCs and Distributed Centers. (U) True modernization of DoD's HPC capability and fulfillment of the program's vision and goals requires an on-going pr ogram strategy that addresses all aspects of HPC. While advancing the level of hardware performance is critical to success, the higher objective is to enable better scientific research and technology development for superior weapons, warfighting and related support systems. The goals of the HPCMP are to: Provide the best commercially available, state-of-the-art HPC capacity and capability to enable weapons development and more capable warfighting systems, Ensure development of software tools, supportive programming environments, and applications to exploit the capabilities of HPC, Expand and train the DoD HPC user base to more effectively use HPC, Link users and HPC centers through robust high speed networking (thus facilitating classified and unclassified access and the creation of collaborative work environments), and Engage, leverage, contribute to, and be a major participant in the national HPC infrastructure and exploit benefits for Defense R&D.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-Wide / BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE High Performance Computing Modernization PE 0603755D8Z UNCLASSIFIED (U) Four major contracts to support each of the MSRCs were competitively awarded during FY 1996. These contracts provide equipment for up to five years and comprehensive support services for the next five to eight years. The four MSRCs and their location are: Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station (CEWES), Vicksburg, MS Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO), Stennis Space Center, MS (U) Nichols Research Corporation of Huntsville, AL was awarded contracts to support both the ASC and CEWES MSRCs. Grumman Data Systems of Herndon, VA was awarded the contract to support the NAVO MSRC. Finally, Raytheon E-Systems of Garland, TX was awarded the contract to support the ARL MSRC. Each of the MSRC contracts contains provisions, i.e. established contract options, to allow significant expansion of high performance computing systems and related support systems over the first five years of the contract. These contract options ensure that MSRC system expansions can take place in a timely fashion during each fiscal year. (U) There are currently 17 distributed centers.

Additional HPC systems, storage, and scientific visualization capabilities were acquired to populate and upgrade the established MSRCs to fulfill a substantial portion of the projected HPC requirements of the laboratories and R&D centers. Contract options were executed to upgrade performance at four MSRCs that will minimally triple their computing capability over the current two-year performance level (PL) upgrade period (FY 1999 and FY 2000). The program assessed and prioritized HPC requirements for DCs and deployed new systems at four existing DCs and established two new DCs to accomplish S&T and DT&E mission needs which cannot be met effectively or efficiently at the MSRCs. Per congressional direction, funding was provided to two DCs and 1 MSRC for next generation internet initiatives. (U) Networking: Due to researchers taking greater advantage of their connectivity to high performance computing systems and other researchers, the bandwidth demands on DREN continued to grow and more user sites took full advantage of the DREN ATM fabric. The majority of the effort in FY 1999 was to provide services to selected sites with some increases in bandwidth. Low end users continued to be connected at 3 Mbps and mid to high range users were connected at 155 Mbps (previous plans to connect high range users at 622 Mbps were postponed due to funding reductions imposed prior to FY 1999). Due to reductions in FY 1999 Research, Development Test and Evaluation funding, 6 link upgrades were postponed and 18 partial to full link improvements were postponed. Security enhancements were implemented. Collaborative work continued with the Federal networking community and standards associations to assure DREN remains compatible with future technology changes. Formal acquisition planning for the DREN follow-on contract was begun.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office has corporate-level responsibility for the cooperation and synergism of modeling and simulation (M&S) activities within the Department of Defense. M&S has demonstrated the capability to revolutionize the way in which the Department makes decisions and conducts its operations. Working as a system of systems, M&S can support a full range of applications (e.g. joint training, doctrine development, formulation and assessment of operational plans, mission rehearsal, force structuring and the acquisition of new systems). To ensure effective and efficient use of M&S, the Department has developed a strategy fostering interoperability and re-use, embodied in the Department of Defense Modeling and Simulation Master Plan, which serves as the basis for execution of this program. The major element of the strategy is development of a common technical framework (CTF) for M&S consisting of three components: the High Level Architecture (the most important); Conceptual Models of the Mission Space (CMMS); and Data Standardization. Supporting these is a broad range of shared common services which include environmental representation; human and organizational behavioral representation; verification, validation and accreditation of simulations; a modeling and simulation resource repository; a modeling and simulation operational support activity; and outreach and education initiatives to ensure standardized and timely implementation of the plan. As a result of this effort, the Department will be able to improve readiness, enhance mission rehearsal, optimize investment decisions, and achieve cost-effective acquisitions.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 3R-1 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 JSM (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY1999 Accomplishments: (U) Continued development of HLA technology, prototypes of enhanced capabilities and applications of advanced technology; expanded support, including high performance infrastructure for users of modeling and simulation, to enable them to exploit fully the increased capabilities that will be fielded under the HLA initiative, to include JSIMS and JWARS; designed and developed the prototype for M&S technologies required to implement technology needed to federate simulations operating at different levels of security to support applications for training, analysis and acquisition.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification. This program is a budget activity level 4 based on the demonstration/validation activities ongoing within the program. The purpose of this program is to develop physical security equipment (PSE) systems and to safeguard DoD acquisition information for all DoD components, to include Force Protection. This program supports the protection of tactical and nuclear weapons systems, DoD personnel and DoD facilities. Funding for critical RDT&E security improvements within service channels has fluctuated widely over the years and prompted the FY89 Congressionally directed consolidation of the Services and former Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA)/Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA) PSE RDT&E funds into this single OSD controlled program element. The funds are used to provide PSE RDT&E for individual Service and Joint PSE requirements. The PSE program is organized so that an ongoing DoD- coordinated Joint Action Group, consisting of Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) representatives monitors, directs and prioritizes potential and existing PSE programs. With few exceptions, each Service sponsors RDT&E efforts for technologies and programs, which have multi-service applications. The funds are also employed to evaluate exploratory development of Physical Security Equipment. This program element supports the Army's advanced and engineering development of Interior Detection, Exterior Detection, Security Lighting, Security Barriers and Security Display Units. In a like manner, the program element also supports the Air Force's PSE RDT&E effort in the area of Exterior Surveillance, Entry Control and Airborne Intrusion. Finally, the program supports Navy RDT&E efforts in the areas of Shipboard Security, Waterside Security, Explosive Detection, Locks and anti-compromise and emergency destruction of classified material and equipment. Beginning with FY 1997, this PE includes funding for Force Protection Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (FP COTS) evaluation and testing, which has received focus since the 1996 Khobar Towers terrorist bombing incident. The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies, which are considered effective for DoD use.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification. This program is a budget activity level 4 based on the demonstration/validation activities ongoing within the program. This PE was established in response to Congressional guidance to consolidate DoD robotic programs on unmanned ground systems and related robotic technologies in order to increase focus of the Services' robotic programs on operational requirements. The program will demonstrate maturity of robotics technologies for their application to the formal acquisition process of land systems and subsystems. Emphasis is on the development of robotic technologies that: are amenable to multi-service applications; provide capability in high hazard environments; provide improved battlefield efficiency using supervised autonomous operational capability; reduce or enhance force manpower and support; and are affordable. This PE consolidates the DoD robotics program for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) into two activities: (1) advancement of UGV concepts into Advanced Development (AD) acquisition pro grams and (2) the enhancement and exploitation of critical robotic technologies for today's and future UGV acquisition requirements. Categories under this PE are: (1) the Basic Unexploded Ordnance System (BUGS) - a Joint Service EOD effort to locate and dispose of surface UXO; (2) the Robotics Ordnance Clearing System (ROCS) - a USAF effort to develop a robotic/autonomous vehicle capability for area clearance, including active range clearance (ARC). ROCS Platforms include the following: All-purpose R emote Transport System (ARTS), Subsurface Ordnance Characterization System (SOCS), and Automated Ordnance Excavator (AOE) . This technology can also be applied to formerly used defense sites for cleanup/disposal . (3) The Technology Enhancement program (DEMO III) is centered upon the enhancement and exploitation of critical robotics technologies for today's and future UGV acquisition requirements. DEMO III, in part a follow-on to the very successful DEMO II program, is a four year effort to further advance semi-autonomous technologies . (4) The Family of Tactical Unmanned Vehicles (FTUV) is a joint Army/Marine Corps effort to provide commanders a family of reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition UGV's that are properly sized to operate in a variety of tactical situations. Requirements are emerging for small and medium unmanned systems that improve warfighters situational awareness in scou t, mechanized and infantry in urban terrain operations .UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDExhibit R-2, RDT&E Budget Item Justification Date: February 2000 Man Portable Robotic Systems (MPRS) - is a n effort to develop smaller (10-40 lb.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification. The Demo III Experimental Unmanned Vehicle ( XUV) Program is designed to advance and demonstrate the technology required to develop future unmanned ground combat vehicles through three major thrusts: (1) concerted technology development; (2) modeling, simulation and experimentation; and (3) technology integration and evaluation with users. Demo III focuses on demonstration of technology that will enable the development of small, highly agile, unmanned vehicles capable of off-road, semi-autonomous operation at speeds of up to 32 km/hr during daylight and 16 km/hr at night by 4Q FY 2001. Demo III supports development of two emerging requirements at the U.S. Army Armor School for a robotic scout system and a robotic leader-follower system. Technologies for these systems are applicable to a wide array of Army programs. This program will be transferred to the Army for funding, beginning in FY 2001. Concerted Technology Development: The technology development community, drawn primarily from government laboratories such as National Institute for Standards and Technology ( NIST), the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and the Army Research Lab (ARL) , has organized itself into a series of working groups to address six technology areas deemed critical to the success of the program. The primary focus of the effort has centered on the development of perception for autonomous mobility; algorithms for local planning and autonomous behaviors; an intelligent software architecture ; and a small, highly capable control interface that can be integrated into standard display units. Modeling, Simulation and Experimentation: A modeling, simulation and experimentation effort conducted by the M ounted Battlespace Battle Lab (MBBL) , with assistance from ARL, has been running in parallel with the technology development program. The program has the twin goals of utilizing simulations to estimate the operational effectiveness of differing technological solutions and hardware/software configurations , and developing T actics , Techniques and Procedure s required to employ this technology effectively. An important outcome of this effort will be the technical support package (TSP) that will be required to support the second generation Tactical Unmanned Vehicle (TUV) user appraisal currently scheduled for FY 2002. Technology Integration and Evaluation with Users: This final component of the program will integrateUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDExhibit R-2a, RDT&E Project Justification Date: February 2000 technology on to a testbed vehicle and demonstrate autonomous mobility required to conduct the military scout mission under tactical conditions. Unlike the other program elements, this program element was designed to be conducted by an industrial contractor chosen through a competitive procurement process that is being managed by the U.S. Army Tank -automotive /Armament Command 's Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC). In January 1998 TARDEC awarded a contract to a contractor team le d by the former Robotic Systems Technology (RST) now General Dynamic Robotic Systems (GDRS) , teaming with Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) Center for Intelligent Systems (CIS) and Sarnoff Corporation. (U) FY199 9 Accomplishments : Conduct ed Critical Design Review ( CDR) in mid-November 1998 by the technology integration contractor team who presented their final design and integration plans - the result of an extensive series of trade studies and analyses conducted over the p revious twelve months coupled with feedback from the government at the July Preliminary Design Review - for review, analysis and constructive criticism by the government participants, and for further refinement prior to fabrication of platforms and/or operator control units Completed the second of four constructive simulations investigating alternative chassis configurations with differing size, weight, and mobility characteristics, together with a series of reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition (RSTA) mission packages of varying capability using Modular Semi-Automated Forces ( ModSAF) simulations at the M BBL. Here, the Demo III XUVs were employed together with manned systems to form notional battalion and brigade scout forces engaged in both offensive and defensive operations as part of a mechanized combined arms force.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT : CALS is an international core strategy to share integrated digital product data through a set of standards to achieve efficiencies in business and operational mission areas. DoD's overarching goal in CALS is to develop a seamless defense enterprise in which the knowledge products of the acquisition process are immediately and rapidly accessible to all authorized users while maintaining near immediate currency and quality of information. This desired state is referred to as the \"Integrated Data Environment (IDE)\". The IDE (immediate access to quality information) drives many defense-wide and functional- specific reforms and business process improvements. The rapid sharing of information is an implied requisite of Integrated Product and Process Teams, a fundamental process for implementing concurrent engineering and streamlining project management. Digitized information frees logistics support and operator personnel from the burden of cumbersome document or file formats for information processing or presentation - enabling new methods for the performance of maintenance and training tasks based on interactive electronic technologies. This program element is to (1) assess and transition evolving automation technologies into the CALS strategy; (2) develop, maintain and apply to weapon system program office operations an executable business model for the application of CALS and related technologies; (3) integrate technical and functional requirements into a Shared Information Framework of the standards, protocols, procedures, and network management conventions required to achieve compatible implementation of the IDE throughout the international defense enterprise.

Today, national defense planners and strategists have to operate with the knowledge that future adversaries will have access to satellite derived intelligence, warning, communications, navigation, weather and other information that can significantly enhance their war-fighting capability and increase the risk to U.S. and allied forces.UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDRDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)Date: (MONTH/YEAR) February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide/ Budget Activity ITEM NOMENCLATURE Tactical Anti-Satellite Program Development - PE 0603892D8Z (U) In 1989 the Department of Defense initiated a program to develop a ground-launched, kinetic energy (i.e., hit-to-kill) anti-satellite (KE ASAT) weapon system which would leverage off technologies developed by the U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command in support of the (then) Strategic Defense Initiative Organization. Following a Milestone I Defense Acquisition Board Review in December of 1989, the Army was given responsibility for development of the weapon elements of the system (booster, kill vehicle, launch and ground support systems, and the mission and battery control centers.) The Air Force was given responsibility for development of the command and control elements that would have allowed the Commander-in- Chief, U.S. Space Command (USCINCSPACE) to plan and control ASAT engagements. (U) With the end of the cold war the perceived need for this capability, as well as support for continued funding diminished steadily and the program was restructured several times. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1994 (FY 1994) directed that the program be converted to a Tactical ASAT Technology Program as opposed to an acquisition program with a low funding level. Under this current program, the KE ASAT was test fired in September 1994, successfully meeting all requirements. This 94-pound kill vehicle is the critical component of a KE ASAT. The following has been accomplished to date: KE Hover Test Completed at National Hover Test Facility, Edwards Air Force Base Weapon Control Subsystem (WCS) Demonstrator Software Upgraded and W5 Test Completed Graphical Display System (GDS) Added to WCS Screens KV Divert and Attitude Control System (DACS) Design Upgraded and Components Fabricated KV Flight Software Developed and Testing Initiated on Software Testbed KV Avionics Components Fabricated KV Digital Flyout Simulation Completed Seeker and GN&C Processors Upgraded UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDRDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)Date: (MONTH/YEAR) February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide/ Budget Activity NOMENCLATURE Tactical Anti-Satellite Program Development - PE 0603892D8Z FY 2000 Plans Kill mechanism technology development .500 Digital simulations 2.500 Integration with future space control activities 3.132 Program management 1.100UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDRDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)Date: (MONTH/YEAR) February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide/ Budget Activity ITEM NOMENCLATURE Tactical Anti-Satellite Program Development - PE 0603892D8Z (U) FY 2000 Plans : Complete KV HW/SW Integration KV Hardware-In-Loop testing Integrated Command and Control Subsystem Integration Kill Mechanism Technology Development Digital simulations Integration with future space control activities **Work will not include booster procurement, laser development or space surveillance efforts.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) This Humanitarian Demining R&D program element focuses on the testing, demonstration and validation of equipment suitable for immediate use in various international humanitarian demining missions and environments. The goal is to provide the equipment to the international demining community so that they may assess the equipment`s capabilities in actual demining conditions. This program focuses on R&D technology development that reduces the time and cost associated with demining while improving the overall safety of the operator. This is accomplished through the adaptation of commercial-off-the-shelf equipment, the integration of mature technologies, and the leveraging from past and current R&D project activity in the tactical countermine and unexploded ordnance clearance mission areas. The primary objectives this program aims to achieve in technological development are to improve existing mine detection technologies, overcome the heavy vegetation problems in specific environments, and provide improved protection for deminers. These areas of emphasis have been adopted as a direct result of the feedback received at the Humanitarian Demining Workshop held in April 1999. Additional technologies identified in these workshops will also be addressed. These include technologies that: detect individual mines/minefields; detect explosives in buried mines (biosensors); confirm the presence of mines (verification); mark and map mines/minefields; improve current wide area survey equipment; clear large areas faster and more efficiently with improved mechanical clearance equipment; improve post clearance quality assurance (QA) equipment; train deminers in mine awareness, and improve deminer hand tools.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 Title: P920t Humanitarian Demining (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY1999 Accomplishments: (U) Successfully developed and demonstrated 19 technologies in mine/minefield detection, mine/vegetation clearance, individual tools, and individual protection equipment.

Kosovo lessons learned revealed that the increasing complexity and difficulty of prosecuting multinational air, land, and sea campaigns is exacerbated by inadequate systems interoperability. Interoperability involves, minimally, C3I weapons and logistics in the fight, and , prior to the fight, requires working the interoperability of tactic, techniques, and procedures. Coalitions are the preferred way to address international crises of the 21st century - lend political legitimacy and provide a broad base of support; coalitions provide resources that mitigate the U.S. burde n to shoulder the preponderance of forces, materiel and finance. This PE directly supports U.S. commitments to the 1999 NATO Summit 's Defense Capabilities Initiative. This program funding will leverage DoD's investment strategy to ensure ongoing DoD programs and Joint Vision 2010 (JV2010) technologies operate in the coalition environment.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification. This program is a budget activity level 5 based on the successful transition of robotic technologies from Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) activities to Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) as part of an Evolutionary Strategy. This PE was established in response to Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Service agreement at the April 1997 Joint Robotics Program General Officer Steering Committee (GOSC). The agreement was to have OSD retain oversight of DoD robotics programs through EMD. Individual Services are responsible for requirements generation and procurement funding. Within the JRP, emphasis is on the development of robotic technologies that: are usable in multi-service missions; provide capability in hazardous environments; provide improved battlefield efficiency using supervised autonomous operational capability; reduce or enhance force manpower and sustainability; and are affordable. Success has been achieved in four programs to justify EMD at this time. This PE establishes the consolidated DoD robotics program for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and advances UGV concepts into EMD for (1) the Standardized Robotic System (SRS) - a generic, modular set of kits that can be used to retrofit several different types of currently fielded vehicles to allow remote obstacle breaching operations (minefields, earthworks, bunkers, etc.), and have supported operations in Bosnia and Kosovo; (2) the Robotic Combat Support System (RCSS) - a three phase block upgrade program to the \"Block 0\" Product Improved Mini-Flail for anti-personnel (AP) landmine/ scattermine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) proofing for the light, rapid deployment forces; (3) the Mobile Detection Assessment Response System, Interior (MDARS-I) - which will provide physical security inside warehouses of fixed installations and large storage facilities, protection of critical inventory items and track movement of items in warehouses and ammunition storage facilities; and (4) the Mobile Detection Assessment Response System, Exterior (MDARS- E)- that are intended to provide unmanned roving security patrols among the buildings and around the perimeter of large fixed installations.UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDExhibit R-2, RDT&E Budget Item Justification Date: February 2000 B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The program element funds ongoing system level engineering of the existing LINK-16 system and the development of the next generation LINK-16 system, the Multifunctional Information Distribution System Low Volume Terminal (MIDS-LVT). System level engineering involves expanding the application of LINK-16 to U.S. forces, technical lead for Spectrum Management and Certification, and the analysis and development of enhancements to improve LINK-16 operational effectiveness. The MIDS-LVT is a joint international cooperative program involving the U.S., France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. The MIDS-LVT will make LINK-16 affordable for a much larger population of U.S. platforms and systems and will be interoperable with previously developed and produced LINK-16 equipment, JTIDS Class 1 and 2. This program is funded under BA-5, Engineering and Manufacturing Development, because it encompasses engineering and manufacturing development of new end-items prior to production approval decision.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT Beginning in FY 2001, this Program Element has moved from Budget Activity 5 to Budget Activity 7. The purpose of the Commercial Operations and Support Savings Initiative (COSSI) is to reduce weapon system life cycle costs, especially operating and support (O&S) costs, by inserting commercial products into military systems. COSSI is a crucial element in DoD`s strategy to reduce the operations and support (O&S) costs of fielded equipment and supports the DoD goal of reducing logistics costs by 20 percent by 2005. As legacy systems age, O&S costs increase, and COSSI is an effective way to lower these costs. COSSI also allows DoD to capitalize on the commercial innovation cycle so equipment can be modernized faster. Adapting commercial technologies for use in military equipment often requires non- recurring engineering, testing and qualification. COSSI shares the costs of these efforts between the contractor and the Government. If the testing is successful and the cost savings validated, the items are purchased as retrofits. All COSSI projects must have an endorsement by a military customer and be linked to an existing military system. The benefits include: improved mean time between failure, improved logistics support by reducing parts obsolescence, reduced software reprogramming time and costs, improved performance, and the promotion of open system designs making future upgrades easier and less costly. COSSI uses Other Transactions rather than FAR procurement contracts so companies that do not normally do business with DOD are given the opportunity to provide cost saving ideas that would otherwise go unnoticed. OSD funding provides the Services an incentive to structure joint projects with pervasive impact across weapon systems, and to institutionalize the use of Other Transaction Agreements.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 P805 Commercial O&S Savings Initiativ e (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY1999 Accomplishments: (U) In FY 1999 Program Management transferred from DARPA to OSD and the Services. FY 1999 COSSI funding supported the development, documentation, integration, and test of upgrades to the legacy Mission Computer and Stores Management Computer on the AV8B. The upgrade project used commercial components and converted assembly language software into a higher order language (C++). In addition, the project integrated the Joint Direct Attack Munition, the ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispenser, the Havequick/Sincgars secure communications system, and the Common Missile Warning System within the AV8B Electronic Warfare Suite. The contractor perforomed system development tasks and developed a System Development Plan; researched, defined and documented the system architecture to include functional requirements, performance requirements, and interface requirements; developed, provided and fully documented tested software code; developed hardware to meet system requirements; performed system and subsystem integration; delivered a System Configuration Set and provided engineering support for operational test and evaluation. The contractor supported implementation of the System Configuration Set in Fleet and production aircraft. ($ 7.221 Million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA FY2000 Plans: (U) COSSI is providing funds to develop and install an Integrated Mechanical Diagnostic/Health and Usage Management System on AH-1 helicopters. The system collects real time data on helicopter performance including continuous rotor track and balance, vibration monitoring of the gearbox, drivetrain, and engine, and structural usage monitoring. The project is expected to reduce AH-1 operation and support costs by over $225 million by eliminating rotor track and balance flights, improving the efficiency of maintenance operations, enhancing operational readiness, and extending the period between depot maintenance. COSSI funding is also being used to develop a propeller control unit for P-3 aircraft. The project will replace the current analog/mechanical system with one that is digital/electromechanical. The benefits include higher reliability, elimination of control system adjustments requiring ground operation and flight checks, a built in test capability to improve trouble shooting, and elimination of parts obsolescence. The new propeller control unit is expected to reduce P-3 operation and maintenance costs by over 35 million during the next 12 years. ($ 11.582 Million) (U) FY2001 Plans: (U) DoD will again issue a joint solicitation for the FY2001 program. Lessons learned during previous COSSI solicitations will be used to further refine the program. DoD will use the OSD line to incentivize joint projects. Based on previous experience, most cost saving projects are expected to pertain to upgrading electronics and computers on legacy aircraft.

UNCLASSIFIED(U) A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT : Most of the Department's current accounting systems and processes were designed primarily to provide budgetary accounting information and reports required by the Congress and the Office of Management and Budget. Consequently, many of these systems do not satisfy current cost accounting information requirements recently imposed on all federal government agencies nor meet the Department's management needs for cost information in support of more cost effective decisions. The program supports an initiative to improve cost accounting capabilities within the Department. The program will support cost accounting pilots to improve: (1) the accumulation and identification of cost information, (2) the analysis of cost information for making more cost effective decisions, (3) visibility of the cost of operations and programs and (4) delivery of relevant and reliable information to program managers in a way that better relates costs to outputs and activities.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Brief Description of Element This program element funds the Joint Unexploded Ordnance Coordination Office (JUXOCO) of the Unexploded Ordnance Center of Excellence (UXOCOE) to develop policy and provide oversight in coordinating requirements and technology in detection and clearance of unexploded ordnance (UXO) within the Department of Defense (DoD), as well as with other United States and international agencies, academia, and industry; to establish and maintain standards for testing, modeling, and the evaluation of unexploded ordnance detection and clearance technology; and to establish, gather, and maintain a database of the results of these efforts. In response to a request from the House National Security Committee (HNSC) and concerns of the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Department of Defense submitted a plan in March 1997, \"Report to Congress: Unexploded Ordnance Clearance: A Coordinated Approach to Requirements and Technology Development.\" This report was developed by a joint, inter-agency task force comprised of the proponents of the unexploded ordnance (UXO) clearance mission areas (active range clearance, humanitarian demining, countermine, explosive ordnance disposal, and environmental remediation). The report defined research and development priorities, program management, and cooperative activities for technology applicable to area ordnance clearance, also known as UXO clearance. The report also described a plan to maintain visibility over and leverage technology efforts within DoD, at other government agencies, and in private industry for the detection, neutralization, and disposal of UXO. In May 1997, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology directed the establishment of the UXO Center of Excellence (UXOCOE) to implement this plan, and in October 1997, the Department established the operational arm of the UXOCOE, the Joint UXO Coordination Office (JUXOCO), which is collocated with the Night Vision Electronic Sensors Directorate at Ft. Belvoir, VA. Program Accomplishments and Plans: (U)FY 1999 Accomplishments : Prepared and submitted report to Congress. Functioned as the focal point for UXO detection and clearance expertise.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Brief Description of Element This program element funds the Joint Unexploded Ordnance Coordination Office (JUXOCO) of the Unexploded Ordnance Center of Excellence (UXOCOE) to develop policy and provide oversight in coordinating requirements and technology in detection and clearance of unexploded ordnance (UXO) within the Department of Defense (DoD), as well as with other United States and international agencies, academia, and industry; to establish and maintain standards for testing, modeling, and the evaluation of unexploded ordnance detection and clearance technology; and to establish, gather, and maintain a database of the results of these efforts. In response to a request from the House National Security Committee(HNSC) and concerns of th e General Accounting Office (GAO), the Department of Defense submitted a plan in March 1997, \"Report to Congress: Unexploded Ordnance Clearance: A Coordinated Approach to Requirements and Technology Development.\" This report was developed by a joint, inter-agency task force comprised of the proponents of the unexploded ordnance (UXO) clearance mission areas (active range clearance, humanitarian demining, countermine, explosive ordnance disposal, and environmental remediation). The report defined research and development priorities, program management, and cooperative activities for technology applicable to area ordnance clearance, also known as UXO clearance. The report also described a plan to maintain visibility over and leverage technology efforts within DoD, at other government agencies, and in private industry for the detection, neutralization, and disposal of UXO. In May 1997, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology directed the establishment of the UXO Center of Excellence (UXOCOE) to implement this plan, and in October 1997, the Department established the operational arm of the UXOCOE, the Joint UXO Coordination Office (JUXOCO), which is collocated with the Night Vision Electronic Sensors Directorate at Ft.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT Beginning in FY 2001, this Program Element has moved from Budget Activity 5 to Budget Activity 7. The purpose of the Commercial Operations and Support Savings Initiative (COSSI) is to reduce weapon system life cycle costs, especially operating and support (O&S) costs, by inserting commercial products into military systems. COSSI is a crucial element in DoD`s strategy to reduce the operations and support (O&S) costs of fielded equipment and supports the DoD goal of reducing logistics costs by 20 percent by 2005. As legacy systems age, O&S costs increase, and COSSI is an effective way to lower these costs. COSSI also allows DoD to capitalize on the commercial innovation cycle so equipment can be modernized faster. Adapting commercial technologies for use in military equipment often requires non- recurring engineering, testing and qualification. COSSI shares the costs of these efforts between the contractor and the Government. If the testing is successful and the cost savings validated, the items are purchased as retrofits. All COSSI projects must have an endorsement by a military customer and be linked to an existing military system. The benefits include: improved mean time between failure, improved logistics support by reducing parts obsolescence, reduced software reprogramming time and costs, improved performance, and the promotion of open system designs making future upgrades easier and less costly. COSSI uses Other Transactions rather than FAR procurement contracts so companies that do not normally do business with DOD are given the opportunity to provide cost saving ideas that would otherwise go unnoticed. OSD funding provides the Services an incentive to structure joint projects with pervasive impact across weapon systems, and to institutionalize the use of Other Transaction Agreements.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 P805 Commercial O&S Savings Initiativ e (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY1999 Accomplishments: (U) In FY 1999 Program Management transferred from DARPA to OSD and the Services. FY 1999 COSSI funding supported the development, documentation, integration, and test of upgrades to the legacy Mission Computer and Stores Management Computer on the AV8B. The upgrade project used commercial components and converted assembly language software into a higher order language (C++). In addition, the project integrated the Joint Direct Attack Munition, the ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispenser, the Havequick/Sincgars secure communications system, and the Common Missile Warning System within the AV8B Electronic Warfare Suite. The contractor perforomed system development tasks and developed a System Development Plan; researched, defined and documented the system architecture to include functional requirements, performance requirements, and interface requirements; developed, provided and fully documented tested software code; developed hardware to meet system requirements; performed system and subsystem integration; delivered a System Configuration Set and provided engineering support for operational test and evaluation. The contractor supported implementation of the System Configuration Set in Fleet and production aircraft. ($ 7.221 Million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 2000 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA FY2000 Plans: (U) COSSI is providing funds to develop and install an Integrated Mechanical Diagnostic/Health and Usage Management System on AH-1 helicopters. The system collects real time data on helicopter performance including continuous rotor track and balance, vibration monitoring of the gearbox, drivetrain, and engine, and structural usage monitoring. The project is expected to reduce AH-1 operation and support costs by over $225 million by eliminating rotor track and balance flights, improving the efficiency of maintenance operations, enhancing operational readiness, and extending the period between depot maintenance. COSSI funding is also being used to develop a propeller control unit for P-3 aircraft. The project will replace the current analog/mechanical system with one that is digital/electromechanical. The benefits include higher reliability, elimination of control system adjustments requiring ground operation and flight checks, a built in test capability to improve trouble shooting, and elimination of parts obsolescence. The new propeller control unit is expected to reduce P-3 operation and maintenance costs by over 35 million during the next 12 years. ($ 11.582 Million) (U) FY2001 Plans: (U) DoD will again issue a joint solicitation for the FY2001 program. Lessons learned during previous COSSI solicitations will be used to further refine the program. DoD will use the OSD line to incentivize joint projects. Based on previous experience, most cost saving projects are expected to pertain to upgrading electronics and computers on legacy aircraft.
