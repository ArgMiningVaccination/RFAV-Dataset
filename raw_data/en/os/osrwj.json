Marcolina, MD, FACP HONEYBEES ,APIS MELLIFERA ,HA VE LONG BEEN APPRECIATED FOR more than just honey. Bee venom, although widely accepted in this country for use in desensitization protocols for patients who have suffered life-threat-ening anaphylactic reactions to bee stings, has not been widelyaccepted for the treatment of other ailments. It has long been used inEurope and Asia for the treatment of arthritic conditions and, morerecently, multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic neurodegenerative dis-ease that may have different disease presentations and clinical cours-es in given patients. 1 Historical Use The use of bee stings for the treatment of rheumatism and bald- ness was discussed in the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, whichdates from approximately 2000 BC and is an important archive ofmedical practices in the ancient Nile Valley. 2Even Hippocrates used dried pulverized bees and bee stings in his practice of medicine.3 Formal scientific inquiry into bee-related clinical applications began with Terc, an Austrian physician in 1880, who was the first touse bee stings in his practice as therapy for rheumatoid arthritis andneuritis. Although he published several favorable reports about salu-tary effects in his patients, widespread use of this modality in Euro-pean medical practice did not occur until the early 1900s. 4 Chemical Constituents of Bee Venom Table 1 outlines the major chemical constituents of bee venom and their effects.

One mechanism by which bee venom has been postu- lated to suppress the induction of arthritis is via adreno-cortical hormone release. Zurier et al demonstrated theability of whole bee venom, but not its component melit-tin, apamin, or phospholipase A fractions, to block theonset of adjuvant arthritis in rats. Neither whole venomnor its constituents had any effect on established disease.The suppressive effects of the venom were reversed byadrenalectomy. 6 Previous studies by Vick and Shipman and Vick and Mehlman showed that whole bee venom produced sus-tained rises of plasma cortisol in dogs and monkeys,whereas hypophysectomy prevented bee venom-induced adrenal stimulation in these animals. 7,8 Chang et al, however, showed that the time course of adjuvant arthritis suppression by bee venom (0.5 mg/kgconcentration) to be different than steroid use.9These authors theorized that bee venom directly suppressedimmune cells responsible for arthritis initiation. Theyalso demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of beevenom on arthritis initiation was greatest when it wasadministered simultaneously with (and into the sameanimal paw as) the adjuvant. This suggested a role forantigen competition in blocking arthritis onset. Finally, Somerfield et al showed in in vitro studies that whole bee venom inhibited superoxide and hydro-gen peroxide production from normal human polymor-phonuclear leukocytes in a dose-dependent fashion withmaximal effect at 1.5 microgram/cc. 10The investigators were able to isolate melittin as the peptide constituentresponsible for this action. On this basis, they postulatedthat whole bee venom may have an important role toplay in the treatment of inflammatory tissue damage inrheumatic, cardiac, and central nervous system disease.However, the doses of venom required for anti-inflam-matory effects would require patients to be exposed to aprohibitively large number of bee stings or the equiva-lent in venom dosage. 11 Clinical Studies Kroner et al performed an uncontrolled study of 100 patients ages 21-74 years with rheumatoid arthritis treat-ed with intradermal injection of bee venom solution(Apicosan) into their most painful joints. 4All were given a test dose of venom prior to therapy and excluded fromthe study if they had a reaction. Seventy-three showeddefinite improvement as judged by a decrease in sedi-mentation index and an alleviation of clinical symptoms.Seventeen of these patients remained symptom-free sixmonths to a year after discontinuation of the treatments. Subsequently, however, Hollander et al reported the first controlled trial of bee venom efficacy in 24 patientswith rheumatoid arthritis. 12These patients received the equivalent of 10-30 bee stings as intradermal injectionsper visit over an average of 18 sessions with sessionsperformed twice weekly. Controls were nine rheumatoidarthritis patients injected with a milk protein mixture.Improvement occurred in seven of 24 (29%) venom-injected patients and in three of nine (33%) milk pro-tein-injected patients. The conclusion was that beevenom therapy (BVT) offered no significant improve-ment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Hauser et al performed a study of the response of 73 patients diagnosed with either chronic progressive MSor relapsing-remitting MS to BVT. 13Patients were diag- nosed with MS on the basis of MRI imaging, clinicalsymptoms, and/or clinical evaluation by their referringneurologists/physicians.

Patients received a subdermal injection equivalent to one bee sting everyother day for one week and dosages were increased each week by one shot per session until positive clinicaleffects plateaued. If a skin wheal developed that waslarger than a silver dollar, patients were to halve thevenom dose. Tracking of improvement/disability was assessed every three months for 12 months using the MultipleSclerosis Follow Up Questionnaire, the Related Ob-servable Symptoms Scale Survey (ROSS), and patientratings on the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale.Twenty-two of 73 patients were dropped from the studydue to lack of follow-up, inability to handle the pain from BVT injections, or inability of caregivers togive the injections. At 12 months, the remaining 51 subjects perceived improvement in balance (34%), co-ordination (32%), fatigue (44%), and bowel control(31%). Sadly, the study lacked a control and objectivemethods of measuring improvement in perceived param-eters and had small numbers of patients with a largedrop-out rate. Current Usage Table 2 summarizes the products from bees and bee hives currently used medicinally. Administration of Bee Venom Although many flying insects have a venomous sting, it is the honeybee that has been domesticated and easiestto raise and, therefore, its venom has been the subject ofmuch study. Bees produce approximately 0.1 mg driedvenom per venom sac. 14 The use of live bees as sting therapy for various con- ditions presents practical problems, which include find-ing a source of bees, and then storing and retrieving thebees for use as stingers. It is difficult to control theamount administered when venom from live bees is used for therapy. 14 Formulation Present day collecting technologies are based upon the use of a collector frame in the bottom of the hive,which contains wire grids from which electrical shocksare administered to the bee. When the bees receive theelectrical shock they sting onto a glass sheet. The col-lected venom dries on the sheet to a gum like substancewithout loss of potency and is subsequently scraped andstored in a cool, dry place and used to produce solutionsin an injection form. Dilutions of 1:1,000 (3x), 1:1,000,000 homeopathic prod-ucts. Apitronic Services in Calgary, Canada, collects andprocesses whole, dried honeybee venom, which it pro-vides to research institutes, chemical and pharmaceuti-cal companies, physicians, and pharmacies. 1,3 Adverse Reactions For 0.5-2% of the population, a bee sting can trigger anaphylaxis with hypotension, respiratory collapse, andeven death unless prompt medical attention with epi-nephrine and supportive care is instituted. Use of BVTin these patients is contraindicated except for desensiti-zation protocols under the supervision of qualified med-ical professionals. Side effects reported during BVT include localized itching, burning, swelling, and pain at the injection site.BVT is contraindicated during pregnancy as it is anabortifacient. 15 Conclusion There is no conclusive evidence in clinical studies that BVT is useful for the treatment of arthritis or multi-ple sclerosis at this time.

Green Tea for Weight Loss By Jay Udani, MD, and Myles Spar, MD, MPH THERE HAS BEEN GROWING INTEREST IN THE USE OF green tea and green tea extracts to promote weight loss. As concern with adverse effects from ephedraproducts grows, more and more consumers are lookingfor alternative natural supplements to assist with weightloss. Green tea may be the best alternative. Obesity Obesity is a significant health problem in the United States. According to the Surgeon General's Report onOverweight and Obesity, 61% of American adults wereoverweight in 1999; 1even more recently, 33% of adult females and 28% of adult males in the United Stateswere estimated to be obese. The annual revenue for thedieting industry is estimated to be more than $30 billion. 2 Green Tea Tea is second only to water as the world's most popular beverage. Such popularity of tea has been 16 February 2003Table 2 Products of bees and beehives and their uses3,16 Product Hive Use Properties Clinical Applications Pollen Primary protein/vitamin Nutritive Food, allergy desensitization hygroscopic Beeswax Protection Structural desensitization Bee Predator superoxide production, leucocyte phagocytosis (in vitro) demonstrated in Asia for millennia, and the demand for this important beverage has been growing in theWest, as its health benefits, ranging from cancer preven-tion\u2014with potential for the inhibition of angiogene-sis\u2014to cholesterol lowering, have become more widely known. Preparation All tea is picked from a leafy green shrub in the same family as Camellia plants ( Camellia sinensis ). Only the most tender new leaves are picked for tea. If black tea ismade, the new leaves are allowed to ferment and cure,thus oxidizing. This process adds flavor to the tea, but italso allows chemicals in the leaves to break down someof the active chemicals in the tea, such as the polyphe-nols, which appear to be responsible for green tea'smany health effects. Black tea, therefore, may lackmany of the health benefits that will be discussed inrelation to green tea. Green tea is prepared by lightly steaming the leaves after picking. This steaming preserves the polyphenolsand prevents fermentation, destroying the enzymes thatwould break down the active compounds in the leaf andcause them to oxidize, thus preserving the activity ofthe polyphenols. Physiology Chemically, green tea functions as an antioxidant because of its particular types of polyphenols, known ascatechins, which are up to eight times more powerful asantioxidants than vitamin C, as measured by total radicalscavenging activity. 3Antioxidants promote health by repairing or preventing damage caused by chemicalsthat generate free radicals; green tea polyphenols havebeen shown to be antimutagenic in vitro. Green tea extract has been shown to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in mouse models,perhaps by inhibiting angiogenesis. Other Health Effects Traditional Chinese medicine uses green tea to facili- tate digestion, stabilize body temperature, and enhancemental function. Ayurvedic medicine employs green teaas an astringent, stimulant, and diuretic. In humans, epidemiologic studies have shown chemoprotective effects of green tea. One study in Japanshowed that increased consumption of green tea wasassociated with a decreased risk of developing adeno-matous polyps of the sigmoid colon. Green tea also has been shown to decrease cholesterol and triglyceridelevels. 4Green tea also may decrease the occurrence of thromboembolism by inhibiting platelet aggregation.1Mechanism of Action It has been shown in vitro that the catechins in green tea can inhibit an important enzyme, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which normally causes a adipose tissue.Because COMT degrades it is inhibiting the action of COMT, green tea cate-chins allow for a prolonged effect of norepinephrine onthermogenesis and fat metabolism. Green tea extracts also have been shown to inhibit lipolysis. Lipolysis is the process by which dietary fats(triglycerides) are broken down by gastric and pancreat-ic lipases so that the resultant fatty acids can be absorbedin the small intestine. Inhibition of the breakdown oftriglycerides prevents absorption of the fat, therefore, intheory, promoting less weight gain. Laboratory Studies Studies have investigated the ability of green tea and green tea extract to stimulate thermogenesis and toinhibit triglyceride metabolism. Because green tea con-tains caffeine and caffeine is known to promote thermo-genesis, several studies have been carried out to showthe effects of the green tea catechin polyphenols. In one study done on brown fat cells in vitro, it was shown that the catechins in the green tea extract workedmuch more strongly than caffeine alone. In fact, syner-gistic work with caffeine was observed: Caffeine had asimilar effect to the catechins in inducing thermogene-sis. 5The effect was equal to or greater than an ephedrine-caffeine combination.6 In vitro studies have demonstrated a dose-dependent lipolysis through inhibition of the gastricand pancreatic lipases by green tea extract. When thesestudies were replicated in conditions more similar to thehuman body, the results were less striking. 7 Clinical Studies A group from the University of Geneva compared green tea extract (containing 1,500 mg extract with 270mg epigallocatechin and 150 mg caffeine) vs. caffeine(150 mg) vs. placebo in a double-blind three-arm studyamong 10 healthy men. 8The green tea extract group had a significant increase in energy expenditure and fat oxi-dation over both of the other two arms. The tea groupdid show somewhat greater inhibition of carbohydrateoxidation. This means that the extract helped increase fatmetabolism, contributing to a higher energy expendi-ture, but caused a decrease in carbohydrate metabolism.The decreased metabolism of carbohydrates reduced theenergy expenditure, but the net change was still in favorof increased energy expenditure. The extract used was Alternative Medicine Alert 17an alcohol extract of dried green leaves containing 8.35% caffeine and 24.7% catechins. A French group performed a double-blind random- ized study of green tea powder vs. placebo in 60 obesewomen. 9The green tea group exhibited significantly greater weight loss and decrease in waist circumferenceat 15 and 30 days. The amount of catechins was notspecified, but the formula used included 250 mg wholetea powder in the form of green tea \"Arkocaps.\" No sideeffects were mentioned when subjects were asked by in-vestigators; no withdrawals or drop-outs were reported. A more recent study was published using a newer version of the same formulation. 10The green tea extract used was AR25, which contains 25% catechins. Thisstudy referenced older work the extractinhibited gastric and pancreatic lipases and increasedthermogenesis in vitro. This clinical trial showed adecrease in weight by 4.6% and waist circumference by4.5% after three months of AR25 use. Dosage/Formulation The normal adult consumption of tea in Japan is 2-3 cups per day with an average of 60 mg of polyphenolsper cup. Because green tea can seem bland to the Amer-ican consumer used to the strong taste of black tea, mar-keters are producing green tea in a variety of flavors.These flavorings, if natural, appear to do nothing todecrease the health benefits of the tea and may make iteasier for the average consumer to drink. Despite the great increase in tea choices available, people will look for the increased convenience andstronger effects found in encapsulated forms. Availableproducts usually are standardized to the total polyphenolcontent (60-97% total polyphenols) or to epigallocate-chin gallate, the most powerful antioxidant in green tea.Decaffeinated products are recommended because inthis form, green tea extract would provide a very highdose of caffeine. A dose of approximately 250 mg ofpolyphenols was used most often in clinical studies. Adverse Effects The polyphenols themselves in green tea have not been associated with any significant side effects or toxi-city. There is evidence that condensed polyphenoliccompounds in the form of flavonoids (catechins or tan-nins) of tea is linked to a high rate of esophageal cancerin regions of heavy tea consumption. A high tannin con-centration in tea may be overcome by adding milk,which binds the tannin, possibly preventing its detrimen-tal effects. 11Other adverse effects that have been men- tioned include gastrointestinal upset and constipation.12 There also has been reported an association of microcyt-ic anemia among infants with the intake of more than 250 mL/d.13 An average six-ounce cup of green tea will have from 10-60 mg of caffeine. Caffeine is a central nervous stim-ulant that can induce nervousness, insomnia, tachy-cardia, elevated blood sugar and cholesterol levels, andhigh levels of stomach acid and heartburn. Although thisamount of caffeine is much less than is present in blacktea or coffee, caffeine-sensitive individuals or thosedrinking a large amount of tea can see some of the nega-tive effects of too much caffeine. These also couldinclude jitteriness, tremor, and increased anxiety. Forthose people, a decaffeinated green tea is best. Supplements containing concentrates of green tea that are not decaffeinated would contain large amountsof caffeine, which could lead to similar symptoms. Conclusion Although larger randomized controlled trials are needed, the few studies that have been done suggest thatgreen tea may be a safe and effective alternative toephedra for stimulating thermogenesis for weight loss.Further studies will require a longer evaluation of greentea to determine if the effect of green tea catechins isattenuated with time. Preliminary in vitro and animal data also show prom- ise for green tea's ability to inhibit lipolysis. Althoughthis could be advantageous in terms of weight-loss pro-motion, it also could cause a decrease in the absorptionof important omega-3 fatty acids and fat-soluble vita-mins. Clinical trials in humans are needed for furtherclarification of green tea's role and its relationship to thismechanism of weight loss. Recommendation Decaffeinated green tea extracts have begun to demonstrate efficacy with minimal side effects; there-fore, with more supporting research, this product couldbe useful as an adjunct to a weight-loss program. It isrecommended that the consumer look for products list-ing the total polyphenol or catechin content. The clinicalstudies mentioned in this article used at least 250 mg ofactive catechins per day. Thus, it would be advisable touse an equivalent amount. Of course, the use of greentea or green tea extract must be incorporated into a more comprehensive weight-loss program that includesexercise and proper diet.

O'Math\u00fana, PhD ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE ALWAYS HAS INCLUDED ITS share of anti-aging remedies. Supplements like DHEA, human growth hormone, melatonin, and othernatural hormone therapies have been marketed as theelixir of youth. Testosterone is the latest addition to hor- monal anti-aging remedies. Its use in older men hasaccompanied increased controversy over the existenceof andropause, or male menopause, and if it exists,whether testosterone safely and effectively treats it.Given concerns about hormone replacement therapy inwomen, physicians likely will receive many questionsabout the safety of testosterone use from older malepatients. Background Interest in the effects of testosterone in older men is traced to 1889 when a 72-year-old French physiologist,Charles Brown-S\u00e9quard, presented a medical paper onan extract prepared from dog and guinea pig testicles.Injecting the extract gave dramatically improved physi-cal strength and cognitive abilities. However, a veryrecent experiment failed to produce physiologically sig-nificant quantities extracts preparedusing Brown-S\u00e9quard tes- ticular extracts were marketed widely until testosteronewas identified in 1935 as the key male hormone. As menopause results from reduced estrogen produc- tion, male symptoms that result from reduced testos-terone levels have been labeled andropause, malemenopause, viropause, male low-testos-terone syndrome. 2The necessity of injecting testos- terone limited its popularity, until patches and gelsbecame available. 3The publicity has led to a doubling in the number of testosterone prescriptions between 1997and 2001. 4 Natural History and Pharmacology Total testosterone levels decline gradually with age. At the same time, men report a variety of symptoms,which most commonly include a lack of energy, reducedmuscle mass, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, depres-sion, and reduced cognitive function. During menopause, estrogen levels decrease dramati- cally, but testosterone levels decline gradually in men,about 1% per year between ages 40 and 70. 2This reduc- tion occurs in free testosterone (the biologically activefraction); usually does not decline age 60. 2Individual variability is high, but testos- terone production is estimated to be reduced by one-third at age 70 and by half at age 80. 5The overall preva- lence of actual hypogonadism is low, with estimatesranging from 20-30% of older men. 6A common lower serum level many assays is 350 ng/dL or14 nmol/L. 7 Testosterone levels are controlled by a complex inter- play of several hormones, and are influenced by con-founding factors, including smoking, obesity, alcohol Alternative Medicine Alert 19use, lifestyle, and concomitant illnesses. Some argue that the symptoms of andropause are due more to declin-ing health with age, rather than declining testosteronelevels. All the symptoms of andropause could be causedby other diseases and conditions, yet many are improvedby supplemental testosterone. 8 Mechanism of Action Reduced testosterone production in older men origi- nally was believed to be due to testicular dysfunction(primary hypogonadism), but now is believed to berelated more commonly to hypothalamic-pituitary dys-function (secondary hypogonadism). 5Testosterone has powerful effects on libido and sexual arousal, and ana-bolic effects on muscle, bone, erythropoiesis, and thebrain, affecting mood and cognition. 8 Clinical Studies Clinical studies have focused on the effects of testos- terone replacement therapy on muscular strength andmass, sexual arousal, and general well-being. However,very few controlled studies exist, and those that havebeen conducted are small and of short duration. Forexample, 12 older men with serum testosterone levelsless than 480 ng/dL were randomly assigned to receivebiweekly injections of placebo or testosterone enanthate(doses adjusted to achieve normal physiological concen-trations). 9After six months, those receiving testosterone had significantly increased lean body mass, musclemass, and muscle strength. Another study enrolled 67 healthy older men (mean 76 years) with low bioavailable testosterone levels (< 4.44 nmol/L). 10Subjects were assigned randomly to wear two 2.5 mg testosterone patches or placebo patchesdaily for one year. Only 44 subjects completed the study.Those using placebo patches suffered a 1.6% loss infemoral neck bone mineral density, while those usingtestosterone gained 0.3% (P = 0.015). The testosteronegroup had reduced body fat and increased lean bodymass (P = 0.001). No significant differences were foundin muscle strength, hematocrit, prostate-specific antigen(PSA), or signs of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Very few controlled studies have examined sexual or cognitive changes with testosterone. A controlled studyrandomly assigned 227 hypogonadal men to eithertestosterone gel (either 50 or 100 mg/d) or testosteronepatch (5 mg/d) for six months. 11Sexual function and mood improved significantly in all groups after onemonth, with no further improvement. Lean body massand muscle strength also improved, with the largestimprovement in the 100 mg gel group (P = 0.0002).Hematocrit and PSA levels increased in all groups.In an uncontrolled study, 10 hypogonadal men used testosterone gel for 12 weeks. 6On average, total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol levels were each reduced 15% (P < 0.005), sexual arousal and spontaneous erectionsincreased (P < 0.02), and mood and cognitive abilitiesimproved (P < 0.05). In another uncontrolled study, fivehypogonadal men (mean 277 ng/dL) with major biweekly) then received placeboinjections. While taking testosterone, HAM-D depres-sion scores dropped from 19.2 to 7.2 (P = 0.01). Withintwo weeks of placebo treatment, three subjects relapsedto a mean HAM-D score of 11.3 (P < 0.05). Adverse Effects The prostate is dependent on testosterone, but para- doxically, as testosterone levels drop with age, theprostate enlarges, leading to BPH in many older men, 12 and the discomfort of urinary symptoms. The singlelargest concern with testosterone administration is itsimpact on the prostate. Existing prostate cancer is anabsolute contraindication for testosterone administra-tion. 13However, testosterone's role in causing prostate cancer is less clear. Controlled studies have found highserum testosterone levels associated with a higher risk ofprostate cancer; others have found no correlation; stillothers have found reduced risk. 13Testosterone adminis- tration in hypogonadal men can increase prostate vol-ume and PSA levels, but within normal ranges. Somestudies found that supplemental testosterone reducedprostate volume and PSA levels. 12Careful prostate mon- itoring is essential when administering testosterone. Patients with several other conditions should be mon- itored carefully when taking testosterone.13Those with liver disease should be cautious since the liver metabo-lizes testosterone, and high doses of testosterone canslow the liver's metabolism and increase the risk of toxi-city. Serum lipid profiles are affected by testosterone,requiring monitoring of those with cardiovascular diseases. Hematocrit changes may progress to poly-cythemia. In rare cases, testosterone may lead togynecomastia and thus is contraindicated in men withbreast cancer. Testicular atrophy and decreased sper-matogenesis also have been reported with use. Formulation Testosterone is available in various formulations. 8 Intramuscular injections use testosterone cypionate ortestosterone enanthate (200 mg biweekly). These injec-tions are uncomfortable and lead to wide swings inphysiological levels. Oral testosterone undecanoate 20 February 2003(usually 160 mg/d) is better tolerated, but its absorption is highly variable. Testosterone patches better mimicphysiological production, but have practical problems.Between 42% and 84% of users report adverse skinreactions, and are uncomfortable wearing the patch,especially when it is applied to the scrotum. 6Topically applied gels are available either commercially, thoughtheir potency is generally low, or through compoundingpharmacies. 6Testosterone propionate is available as a generic preparation for topical application. Ongoing Research In June 2002 the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs decided not to proceedwith a large randomized controlled trial of testosteronereplacement therapy, citing problems with designing alarge enough study without subjecting many subjects tounknown risks. 4 Conclusion A growing number of symptoms associated with aging in men have been correlated with decreased levelsof testosterone. Administration of testosterone, by injec-tion, orally, or topically, reverses many of these symp-toms. However, much remains to be learned aboutandropause and testosterone replacement. Great individ-uality exists among men in their production of testos-terone and response to testosterone replacement. Normalranges are broad, and laboratory tests vary widely. Mostof the studies have, to date, been relatively small and ofshort duration, although one study found testosteronepatches safe and well tolerated for 7-10 years. 14 Although much remains to be learned about testo- sterone supplementation for the symptoms of andro-pause and reduced testosterone levels, studies to datehave not revealed serious problems. PSA and hematocritusually are increased, but their clinical significanceremains unclear. The potential for testosterone to stimu-late pre-existing but undetected prostate cancer is ofgreatest concern. In announcing a thorough review oftestosterone replacement therapy, the National Instituteon Aging and the Institute of Medicine cautioned that\"testosterone supplementation remains a scientificallyunproven method for preventing or relieving any physi-cal and psychological changes that men with normaltestosterone levels may experience.\" 15 Recommendation Clinicians are left in a difficult position, given the negative results of the Prempro trial last year, and theeffectiveness of those hormones in controlling symp-toms and (it was believed) in preventing cardiac disease.Men eager to find relief from their age-related symp- toms already are asking clinicians hard-to-answer ques-tions about testosterone replacement. Men who have low testosterone levels may benefit from testosterone replacements with each formulationhaving its pros and cons. While using testosterone,patients should have their prostate and hematocrit close-ly monitored. Patients with prostate or breast cancer, andpatients at high risk for either, should not be giventestosterone. Because most men's testosterone levels remain within the normal range, the risk-benefit analysis for them isless clear. Since many age-related symptoms can haveseveral origins, other potential causes should beexplored before prescription.

Clinical Briefs With Comments from John La Puma, MD, FACP Dietary Strategies for CHD Prevention Source: Hu FB, Willett AREVIEW WAS UNDERTAKEN OF THE best metabolic, epidemiologic, and clinical trial evidence regarding diet andcoronary heart disease (CHD) preven-tion. Controlled trials with clinical end-points were sought; as few exist, sub-stantial weight was given to largeprospective cohort studies that reported disease outcomes and metabolic studieswith established intermediate endpoints. Analyzing MEDLINE through May 2002 for epidemiologic and clinicalinvestigations of CHD and majordietary factors (fat, cholesterol, 233 acids, index, and patterns)yielded 147 original investigations andreviews of metabolic studies, epidemio-logic studies, and dietary interventiontrials of diet and CHD. Data were exam-ined for relevance and quality andextracted by one of the authors. Compelling evidence from metabol- ic studies, prospective cohort studies,and clinical trials in the past severaldecades indicates that at least threedietary strategies are effective in pre-venting CHD: substitution of fats for saturatedand consumption ofomega-3 fatty from fish, fish oilsupplements, or plant sources; and con-sumption of a diet high in fruits, vegeta-bles, nuts, and whole grains and low inrefined grain products. However, simply lowering the per- centage of energy from total fat in thediet is unlikely to improve lipid profileor reduce CHD incidence. Many issuesremain unsettled, including the optimalamounts of monounsaturated andpolyunsaturated fats, the bal-ance between omega-3 and omega-6polyunsaturated fats, the amount andsources of protein, and the effects ofindividual phytochemicals, antioxidantvitamins, and minerals. Substantial evidence indicates that diets using nonhydrogenated unsaturat-ed fats as the predominant form ofdietary fat, whole grains as the mainform of carbohydrates, an abundance offruits and vegetables, and adequateomega-3 fatty acids can offer significantprotection against CHD. Such diets,together with regular physical activity,avoidance of smoking, and maintenanceof a healthy body weight, may preventthe majority of cardiovascular disease inWestern populations. COMMENT More than any other question, patients ask me, \"Is it OK if I eat (fish)(butter) (fast food)?\" Of course, I lovethis\u2014I'd much rather try to clear up theconfusion in the office, by e-mail, or onthe phone, then have to deal with thestroke, heart attack, hypertension, dia-betes, or cancer that is down the road. Drs. Hu and Willett have champi- oned the traditional Mediterranean diet,finding that it is not total fat that mattersin heart disease, but the kind of fat. Thisreview allows them to show us themoney\u2014with extensive and authorita-tive references. They find that a variety of diets can prevent heart disease, as long as theyinclude omega-3 fatty acids(fish, flax, of alcohol (< 5 g/d); and morefruits and vegetables (especially leafygreens, and specifically not potatoes). The authors acknowledge the anatomical success of cardiologist DeanOrnish's very low-fat diet, exercise,stress management, and yoga program,which significantly reduced progressionof atherosclerosis, but find it \"unneces-sarily rigid and difficult for most peopleto follow.\" They show why the major source of protein should come from nuts, soy-beans, legumes, poultry, and fish; themajor source of fats should come fromthe same, and from vegetables, olives,and canola; and the major source of car-bohydrates should come from whole,unrefined grains, fruits, and vegetables.Trans fats should be minimized or elim-inated, as should saturated fats. Recommendation Patients who have coronary disease and want to halt its progression shouldeat this way. To help them maintainmotivation (and a healthy weight) overthe long term, they need one-on-oneaccountability, effective self-monitor-ing, and 150-300 minutes of exerciseweekly.

Treatment of child and adolescent obesity: Reports from pedia-tricians, pediatric nurse practitioners, and registered dietitians. Pediatrics 2002;110(1 Pt 2):229-235; Trowbridge FL, et al. Man-agement child adolescent obesity:Study design and practitioner characteristics.Pediatrics 2002;110(1 Pt 2):205-209. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS to identify interventions used by pediatric health care providers in treat-ment of overweight children and adoles-cents to identify provider educationalneeds. A secondary aim was to examinethe association of certain provider char-acteristics with recommended evalua-tion practices. A random sample of pediatricians, pediatric nurse practitioners, and regis-tered dietitians (RDs) received question-naires about their diet, activity, andmedication recommendations for overweight patients and about refer-rals to specialists and programs. Resultswere examined for adherence to pub-lished recommendations and for asso-ciations with certain respondent characteristics. A total of 940 providers responded (response rate: 19-33%). The majorityrecommended \"changes in eating pat-terns\" more encouraged \"low-fat groups followed recommended eat-ing interventions for school-aged chil-dren and adolescents. More than 80%followed recommended physical activi-ty interventions for all age groups. In each group, about 5% sometimes recommended prescription medicationand herbal remedies for adolescents.None recommended surgery. Two-thirds of pediatricians and pediatricnurse practitioners often toRDs. Approximately 20% referred tochild/adolescent weight programs, butfor 27-42%, these programs or pediatricobesity specialists were not available.No consistent associations betweenrespondent characteristics and adher-ence to recommended interventionswere identified. The providers generally promoted healthy eating and activity with minimaluse of highly restrictive diets or medica- tion to control weight. COMMENT Pediatric obesity is truly alarming. In the United Kingdom, for example, pedi-atric obesity has doubled in the last 20years: 20% of 9-year-olds are over-weight, and 10% are obese\u2014almost asbad as in the United States. Pediatric obesity is not about cos- metics, appearances, willpower, ormorality. It's about calories in/caloriesout; it's about role modeling and familydynamics; and it's about medical conse-quences. Effective clinical practice isjust developing, and the condition is onewith which many clinicians feel ill-equipped. Arguably, the \"recommended eating and exercise interventions\" that theauthors cite are either ineffective or not implemented. Few referrals aremade to specialists by dietitians, and theU.S. Department of Agriculture'sflawed Food Pyramid is part of manyschools' curricula. Clearly, change isneeded. One intervention that is effective is limiting TV viewing. It's not just thatkids are sitting around. It's that everyhour, an average of 10 food commer-cials\u2014fun, bright, upbeat\u2014offer fastfood, soda, candy, and sugary breakfastcereal. And those high-calorie, low-nutrient foods often are just a few steps,or a cry to Mom, away. Cost is one objection to eating better that often is raised by parents. Costanalyses show that the cost of a health-ful diet in a family-based obesity treat-ment program is significantly lessexpensive at 12 months than at baseline (J Am Dietetic Assoc 2002;102:645- 656). This research also shows thatpediatric obesity programs that involveparents are the most effective. Unfortu-nately, parents often have their own per-sonal, psychological, and physical prob-lems with this dilemma. Recommendation Because there is no consensus about how to treat pediatric obesity, except asa family, and because it is difficult totreat, seek out a practitioner, program,or web site that can work one-on-onewith parents and kids. Limiting television to a maximum of two hours daily is an evidence-based behavioral start\u2014one cliniciansshould recommend and parents shouldtrack. 24 February 2003United States Postal Service Statement of Ownership, Management, and Circulation 1.

Arthritis pain alone has driven more Americans to seek complementary and alternative med-icine (CAM) therapies than any other single affliction. And although most patients usingCAM therapies for arthritis employ them as a supplement to rather than a replacement formainstream medical care, they tell researchers they do so because their medications do notprovide complete relief. In many cases, the use of CAM therapies corresponds to the severityof the pain. Glucosamine and Chondroitin The use of glucosamine sulfate with or without chondroitin sulfate is far and away the most popular supplement for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Glucosamine is extracted from the shells of crustaceans and chondroitin is prepared from cow trachea or shark cartilage. Glucosamine has been reported to inhibit cartilage breakdownand stimulate regeneration of cartilage after damage. Chondroitin has been reported to blockthe enzymes that degrade cartilage. Both supplements have been used for many years in Germany and other parts of Europe, and although their effects on joint damage are still being debated, most medical experts agreethat glucosamine works as an anti-inflammatory, reduces pain, and is safe. The best evidence available to date is a large three-year Belgian study that suggests that glucosamine slows the progression of osteoarthritis. 1A similar placebo-controlled trial is underway in the United States under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)and will include chondroitin, glucosamine-chondroitin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory(NSAID) arms. The evidence in favor of chondroitin is less convincing and there have been no clinical tri- als published on the popular combination of the two supplements. It remains unclear whetherpatients get any additional benefits by taking glucosamine and chondroitin together. The operative daily dose for the subjects of the Belgian study was 1,500 mg of glu- cosamine. It usually is divided into two or three doses\u2014and it may take four to eight weeksfor effects to become noticeable. Chondroitin usually is used in similar dosages. If neitherhas an effect within 12 weeks, patients usually are advised to discontinue use. Because glucosamine may affect glucose metabolism, it is not recommended for patients with diabetes until further trials provide better information on its effects on blood glucoselevels. Massage A 2001 survey shows that more than half of osteoarthritis sufferers use massage therapy. 2 And a recent University of Miami (Florida) study of children with rheumatoid arthritisshowed that subjects with mild-to-moderate forms of the disease who were massaged for 15minutes daily by their parents for 20 days experienced immediate lowering of anxiety andEXECUTIVE EDITOR John La Puma, MD, FACPDirector, Santa BarbaraInstitute for MedicalNutrition & HealthyWeightSanta Barbara, CA EDITORIAL ADVISORY BOARD Judith Balk, MD, FACOGAssistant Research ProfessorUniversity of PittsburghPittsburgh, PA of of PennsylvaniaSchool of MedicinePhiladelphia, PA Dennis deLeon, MD, FAAFPAssociate Medical Director Inland Empire Health Plan San Bernardino, CA Barak Gaster, MD Assistant Professor of MedicineUniversity of WashingtonSchool of MedicineSeattle, WA David Schiedermayer, WI Matthew Sorrentino, MD, FACCAssociate Professor ofMedicineThe University of Chicago Pritzker School of MedicineChicago, IL FACT SHEET EDITOR Mary L.

Patients can be taught simple self-massage tech- niques that can be very helpful, especially for arthriticconditions of the hands, wrists, and elbows. Acupuncture and Acupressure Acupuncture, an ancient Chinese treatment, and acu- pressure, its non-invasive cousin, have become widelyaccepted in the United States and for a variety of med-ical conditions. Acupuncture treatments, as prescribed by traditional Chinese medicine, typically involve the insertion of hair-fine needles into the skin along defined tracts calledmeridians, where they help stimulate the flow of qior chi, vital life energy. Acupressure and shiatsu massage, a Japanese form of acupressure, use no needles, but stimulate the samemeridians by applying pressure to certain points on thebody. Qualified practitioners can teach patients acupres-sure techniques. A Japanese animal study showed that electrically controlled acupuncture needles appear to delay the onsetand reduce the severity of arthritis while reducing thecollagen antibody levels. Researchers speculate thatacupuncture may inhibit the production of endogenousinterleukin-1 beta and prostaglandin by suppressinginterleukin and COX-2 gene activations. 4 After a 1998 Consensus Panel review of the available public data, the NIH concluded that acupuncture is apromising treatment for postoperative pain and for nau-sea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy. TheNIH also approved the use of acupuncture as primary oradjunctive therapy for osteoarthritis, tennis elbow,fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, low back pain, and carpaltunnel syndrome. Diet Researchers have long believed that food sensitivities trigger the inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis and per-haps even exacerbate the symptoms of osteoarthritis. Not all patients show food sensitivities, but for many, identifying food sensitivities can make an enormous dif-ference. Some of these patients may have suffered witharthritis for years, never realizing that simple dietarychanges might help. The key is to put patients on a supervised elimination test for several days, eliminating suspect foods and thenre-introducing them one at a time to identify specifictriggers. The most common triggers, by far, are proteinsin dairy products and eggs, followed by corn andpeanuts. The theory was tested by a Norwegian study pub- lished in the Lancet in 1991 in which common arthri- tis food triggers were eliminated. Joint stiffness,swelling, and tenderness decreased and grip strengthimproved. The average pain score dropped from over 5on a 10-point scale to below 3. Most importantly, whenpatients were checked a year later, the benefits were still there. 5 A vegetarian diet appears to benefit about 50% of patients, including those without specifically identifiedfood triggers. Vitamins The jury is still out, but the Framingham Heart Study suggests that vitamins D supplementation may be help-ful alleviate symptoms of osteoarthritis and preventdeterioration. 6 Patients should be advised not to exceed 400 IU of vitamin D daily because higher dosages have beenshown to be toxic.
