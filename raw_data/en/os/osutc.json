On June 17, 2022, the COVID19 vaccine was also authorized for [children under age 5](/health-wellness/about-the-covid-19-vaccine-for-under-5). Below, [Jeffrey Kahn, M.D.,](https://www.childrens.com/doctor-profile/jeffrey-scott-kahn) Director of Infectious Disease at Children's Health and Professor at UT Southwestern, answers parents' frequently asked questions about the COVID19 vaccine for children ages 5-11. Is the COVID19 vaccine safe for children? COVID19 vaccines have been given safely to hundreds of millions of people in the U.S. These vaccines have been closely studied and monitored, and data shows they are safe and highly effective at preventing illness. Still, parents may wonder if the COVID19 vaccine is safe for younger, growing children. The COVID19 vaccine for children had to meet high standards for safety and effectiveness to be authorized by the FDA. In clinical trials, the COVID19 vaccine was found to be safe, well-tolerated and produce a strong antibody response in children. Experts will continue to monitor the vaccine and its safety as more children get vaccinated. Does emergency use authorization mean the COVID19 vaccine is not thoroughly tested? During a public health emergency like a pandemic, the FDA can make medical supplies and treatments available in a timely manner under an emergency use authorization (EUA). A vaccine must be carefully tested and meet rigorous criteria to be authorized for emergency use. The FDA closely reviewed safety and efficacy data on the COVID19 vaccine before authorizing its use in children. How effective is the COVID19 vaccine in children? The COVID19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious illness from COVID19. In clinical trials for children ages 5-11, the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine was 90.7% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID19. For those who did get COVID19 after vaccination, the vaccine appeared to reduce the severity of illness. Among 12- to 18-year-olds, the Pfizer vaccine has been 93% effective at preventing hospitalizations according to the CDC. Unvaccinated adolescents are 10x more likely to be hospitalized with COVID19 than their vaccinated peers. Why should I vaccinate my child for COVID19 if their risk of serious illness is low? Children are at lower risk of serious illness from COVID19 compared to adults. However, the arrival of the highly contagious variants showed that children can and do get sick from COVID19. During late summer and early fall of 2021 when the Delta variant emerged, there was a dramatic [rise in COVID19 in children](/health-wellness/why-are-more-children-getting-covid-19). Then, when the Omicron variant spread, hospitalizations of children for COVID19 spiked. - As of June 2022, over 13.5 million children in the U.S. have tested positive for COVID19. - During the Omicron surge, COVID19 hospitalizations in children ages 5-11 were twice as high for children who were not vaccinated as opposed to children who were vaccinated. - Children with even mild COVID19 symptoms may be at risk for rare long-term side effects, including [multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)](/health-wellness/what-parents-should-know-about-multisystem-inflammatory-syndrome-in-children-and-covid-19). As of mid-June 2022, more than 8,500 children have been diagnosed with MIS-C after COVID19. \"Children can and do experience illness from COVID19. We've seen a spike in COVID19 hospitalizations in children. This includes children who were otherwise healthy and were unvaccinated, as well as younger children, who were not yet eligible to be vaccinated,\" says Dr. Kahn. \"The best way to keep your child safe is to get them vaccinated if they are eligible.\" In addition to keeping your child safe, Dr. Kahn explains that vaccinating children is key to protecting others in your family, as well as the community. \"We know that kids, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, can transmit the virus and are bringing the virus home,\" says Dr. Kahn. \"By immunizing children, we can get this pandemic under control. We all want to return to normal life and with this highly effective vaccine, we have the chance to do that.\" Is the COVID19 vaccine for children the same vaccine as for teens and adults? The COVID19 vaccine for children is the same vaccine as for teens and adults, but it is given in a smaller dose. This smaller dose is due to the development of a child's immune system, not based on a child's size or weight. Will my child experience any side effects from the COVID19 vaccine? Your child may experience some side effects after getting the COVID19 vaccine. Side effects are typically mild and are normal signs that the vaccine is building protection against COVID19. Possible COVID19 vaccine side effects in children include: - Pain, redness or swelling at the injection site - Tiredness - Headache - Muscle pain - Chills - Fever - Nausea COVID19 vaccine side effects may be more common after the second dose than the first dose. These side effects should go away within a few days. Some children have no vaccine side effects. How can I treat my child's COVID19 vaccine side effects? If your child feels pain or discomfort where they got their COVID19 vaccine, try placing a cool, wet washcloth on the area. Encourage them to exercise or move the area. Ask your child's health care provider about additional ways to relieve any pain or discomfort, such as pain or fever-reducing medications following vaccination. Make sure you always give your child the appropriate dose of any medication. Offer plenty of fluids to encourage hydration. It is not recommended that you give your child any pain-relieving medications before they get their COVID19 vaccine to prevent side effects. Should I call my child's doctor about any COVID19 vaccine side effects? Mild side effects, including fever, are normal signs that the vaccine is working to build protection against COVID19. Most of the time, these side effects will go away in a few days. Contact your child's health care provider if: - The redness or pain at the injection site gets worse after 24 hours - Their side effects are worrying you or do not go away after a few days Seek immediate medical attention if you think your child is having a severe allergic reaction to the COVID19 vaccine. Signs of severe allergic reaction include rapid heartbeat, swelling of the throat, rash or hives. This reaction is extremely rare. Could there be any long-term effects of the COVID19 vaccine for children? There is no evidence of any long-term effects of the COVID19 vaccine in children. The COVID19 vaccines have been safely given to millions of people so far. Side effects of any vaccine are most likely to occur within 6 weeks after vaccination. The FDA required the COVID19 vaccine be studied for at least 8 weeks after the final dose to ensure its safety. \"There is always risk of rare side effects from any medication or vaccine,\" says Dr. Kahn. \"I understand that parents may have concerns over what's unknown. But what we do know is that the risks associated with COVID19 illness are far greater than any risk of the vaccine.\" One rare side effect that parents may have heard about is the chance of [heart inflammation, or myocarditis](/health-wellness/can-the-covid-19-vaccine-cause-heart-problems). Dr. Kahn explains that people are more likely to experience myocarditis after COVID19 illness than they are after vaccination. In the rare cases of vaccine-related myocarditis, symptoms have been mild and resolve quickly. Other parents may have heard misinformation that the [COVID19 vaccine affects fertility](/health-wellness/does-the-covid-19-vaccine-cause-infertility). There is no evidence to support this myth. Experts will continue to monitor the COVID19 vaccine to ensure it is safe and effective. Should my child get the COVID19 vaccine if they have a medical condition? Yes, the COVID19 vaccine is safe and recommended for children with chronic or underlying medical conditions. Children with certain medical conditions - including obesity, diabetes, sickle cell disease, cancer, cystic fibrosis, kidney disease and more - may be more likely to get severely ill if they get COVID19. Therefore, it's even more important to make sure these children get vaccinated. Should my child get vaccinated if they've already had COVID19? Your child should get the COVID19 vaccine even if they already had COVID19. Studies have shown that the vaccines can trigger a COVID19 immune response stronger than the one naturally present in people who had COVID19. Will my child need a COVID19 booster or a yearly shot? Booster shots are recommended by the CDC for everyone who is eligible, including kids ages 5 and older. Learn more about COVID19 [vaccine booster shots](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html) and if your child is eligible. Can my child get the COVID19 vaccine at the same time as other vaccines? Your child can get the COVID19 vaccine at the same time as other routine vaccinations. Our immune response and side effects are generally the same when a vaccine is given alone or with other vaccines. Talk with your child's health care provider if you have any questions about your child's vaccine schedule. Where can my child get a COVID19 vaccine? Children may be able to get a COVID19 vaccine at their pediatrician's office, or at a variety of community clinics and pharmacies. Contact your child's health care provider to ask about vaccine availability or see a list of [community vaccination sites](https://www.childrens.com/covid-19/vaccine/community-vaccination-sites). You will not need to pay for your child's COVID19 vaccine. It is given at no cost to the recipient. Where can I get more information about the COVID19 vaccine for children? Information about COVID19 and the COVID19 vaccines may be updated over time. It is important to turn to trusted medical experts to understand what's true and what's not. If you have questions about the COVID19 vaccine and your child's health, ask your child's health care provider for more information. You can also turn to trusted resources, such as the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html). \"It's normal to feel apprehensive, but I encourage parents to consider the risks and benefits. The data is there,\" Dr. Kahn says. \"The COVID19 vaccines are among the best vaccines that have ever been produced and can prevent life-threatening illness. It's a great gift we have, and we have to use it.\" Watch our vaccine town hall to learn more For more information about the COVID19 vaccine, watch a video of our virtual town hall.
