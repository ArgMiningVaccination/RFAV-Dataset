In our adaptive and responsive approach to the pandemic, we are updating some campus protocols and reinforcing others, as outlined below. It is your responsibility to adhere to all campus health protocols, so please review this information carefully. OUTDOOR MASKING Because we currently are seeing low rates of COVID-19 infection, and because the rate of vaccination among the campus community is increasing, we are easing the outdoor mask mandate on the Coral Gables and Marine campuses. Masks are no longer required in outdoor settings. We do, however, recommend outdoor mask use when gathering in large groups. INDOOR MASKING REMAINS MANDATORY Consistent with CDC guidance, indoor mask use is still mandatory, and masks must be worn properly to cover both your nose and mouth. Appropriate masks must be worn in ALL indoor public spaces, including classrooms, libraries, lobbies, elevators, labs, shared laundry rooms, and retail and dining locations. Please remember to carry a face covering with you at all times. Eating or drinking in classrooms should be avoided to allow for consistent and proper mask wearing. Any student not following the University's mask policies may be subject to the student conduct process. TESTING Surveillance testing continues to be an important part of our overall efforts to prevent widespread COVID-19 transmission among unvaccinated individuals. Any student who is not fully vaccinated or has not provided proof of vaccination is required to take a COVID-19 test twice per week. Students will receive email or text message alerts to schedule their on-campus testing appointments. Students who do not comply with the testing requirement will be referred to the Dean of Students office and may face appropriate disciplinary sanctions. Employees with an approved vaccine exemption must continue to test once per week. Employees who do not comply with the testing requirement will be referred to Human Resources or Faculty Affairs. VACCINATION Any student who is fully vaccinated and who has provided proof of vaccination to the University via their MyUHealthChart account currently is exempt from COVID-19 surveillance testing. Students should [upload a copy of their COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card](https://click.connect.miami.edu/?qs=79d0768f1d088db63ddf94f75d317416057ade3051a28eed3349469004c949e158fddf7f4effcb9a226d1ea026b574dbca0a7aa188c4ae55) to their MyUHealthChart account. Fully vaccinated degree-seeking students enrolled in Fall 2021 classes are eligible to receive prizes through our [Voluntary COVID-19 Vaccine Incentive Program](https://click.connect.miami.edu/?qs=79d0768f1d088db671949a9a8f5d4851152300c4814731d296b6fc7fbfbbbb2eaaf98815d6a23cae820d6f31202ac578da35f2843cddd76b).
