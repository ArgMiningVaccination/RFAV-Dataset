Corporates strive for optimal deployment of Assets and reduction of Liabilities in their quest for Business success. In simple words, Assets are what you own and Liabilities are what you owe to others. Even in Spiritual parlance, Assets and Liabilities carry paramount significance in pursuit of enlightenment. Spiritual Assets are those virtues like Compassion, Empathy, Moral Values, Truthfulness etc. which lead us in the right direction towards righteousness. Liabilities are the negative characteristics like dishonesty, jealousy, selfishness etc. which makes human life into a miserable affair and certainly has Karmic consequences as well. From the spiritual perspective, human beings have the potential to convert Liabilities into Assets by reducing or eliminating the intensity of the negative traits. In the course of time, Assets also could turn into liabilities with erosion of values and degeneration of ethical standards. Self realization and willpower to improve are essential to change the character towards the path of Dharma. There are a number of similarities between financial and spiritual models in daily lives. Companies borrow funds and repay later with interest. We also become indebted to any act of kindness, compassion or timely help for which we pay interest in the form of a smile, acknowledgement and gratitude. The principal amount is repaid at an appropriate time through similar acts of kindness. Till then, we regularly pay EMIs (Enormous Mental Indebtedness) with a sense of gratefulness. Companies strive to maintain lower debt levels and higher equity so that the interest burden is within tolerable limits, which is a financially prudent measure. Similarly, it is better for us to give much more than what we receive in order to keep our Karmic balance positive. Companies struggle for higher efficiency by keeping lower Inventory levels and strive to eliminate non-moving Inventories. Individuals also should attempt to convert all ideas, plans and strengths into superior value based output, aimed at the betterment of mankind and the society. In the process, stagnant negative thoughts, beliefs and emotions have to be eliminated in order to achieve progress in all our ventures. Our Karmic balance has the same significance as Net Profit in Company balance sheets, for which people burn midnight oil in their quest for excellent results. Appropriate technology along with suitable tools and equipments are deployed by Organizations to deliver excellent finished products. On similar lines, Bhagwad Gita provides the narrative and adds value to the individual to elevate his stature and grow in the spiritual evolution process in the path of righteousness. Just like technology contributes to operational excellence, the potential of human strength and endeavour is crucial for transforming our lives and proceed in the right direction. The Bhagwad Gita emphasizes that 'Even if we tumble down in our life's journey, the affiliation to transcendence we have cultivated by our spiritual practices is never lost, not even diminished '. Buddhism also reiterates the role of positive state of mind by overcoming negative emotions for lasting peace and happiness. Let us strive to make our Spiritual Balance Sheet positive by burgeoning our Assets and eliminating our liabilities for leading a meaningful, peaceful and happy lives. In this process, let us also steer clear of negative emotions and infuse positivity and mental equilibrium in all our thoughts and actions to become better human beings. "}
