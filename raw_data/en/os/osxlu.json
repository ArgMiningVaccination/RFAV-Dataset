This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was 36 weeks in duration. The trial consisted of a 6-week pretreatment period, a 24-week double-blind treatment period, and a 6-week post-treatment follow-up period. The primary efficacy variables were the mean change from baseline in HbA1c levels and the mean percentage change from baseline in total daily insulin dose. Treatment with acarbose was associated with significant reductions in HbA1c levels of 0.40% (P = 0.0001) and in total daily insulin dose of 8.3% (P = 0.0015). There were also significant reductions in all plasma glucose variables measured, including a 0.9 mmol/l reduction in fasting glucose (P = 0.0440), a 2.6 mmol/l reduction in glucose Cmax (P = 0.0001) and a 270 mmol\u00b7min1\u00b7l1 reduction in glucose area under the curve (P = 0.0002). Although acarbose treatment was associated with a greater incidence of adverse events than was placebo treatment, primarily flatulence and diarrhea, these events did not generally prevent patients from completing the study. The results of this study suggest that acarbose is a safe and effective adjunct to diet and insulin therapy for the management of insulin-requiring type II diabetes. "}
