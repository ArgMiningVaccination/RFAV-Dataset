Autism risk Young children with common ear, nose, and throat issues may be at higher risk of developing autism. Those are the findings of a study published in the British Medical Journal, which looked at more than 10,000 children. Those who experienced autistic traits had issues like mouth-breathing, snoring, ear-pulling, and poor listening skills. Sleep apnea was also closely linked to an autism diagnosis. Stool transplants Stool transplants may be more effective than antibiotics for treating gut issues. A new study published in Cochrane looked at cases of a condition known as c-diff, which causes potentially life-threatening diarrhea. Seventy-seven percent of people who received a stool transplant were not infected again within the next two months, compared to only 40% who were treated with antibiotics alone. Printing vaccines MIT researchers have developed a vaccine printer that can store doses for months at room temperature. The printer generates vaccine-filled microneedle patches. Those patches are then attached to the skin, and the vaccine dissolves without a traditional injection. The printer is also mobile and fits on a tabletop, which scientists say could allow for on-demand vaccines in remote areas without the need for cold storage or shipping. Copyright 2023 WWNY.
