British Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) Mission: The BSACI is the national, professional and academic society which represents the specialty of allergy at all levels. Its aim is to improve the management of allergies and related diseases of the immune system in the United Kingdom, through education, training and research. Founded: 1930 History In 1930 the Asthma Research Club was formed by a group of distinguished clinicians, by 1948 the society had been renamed the British Association of Allergists; and in 1962 it changed its name yet again to the British Allergy Society. Under the careful guidance of such distinguished members as Dr Bill Frankland, Professor Jack Pepys and Sir Cyril Clarke, interest in allergy amongst both clinicians and scientists grew. In the 1970s there was an explosion of interest in the immunological mechanisms of allergic disease and a need was perceived for widening the Society's scope and Clinical Immunology was incorporated into the title. Thus the BSACI was born in 1973. The BSACI's main objective throughout its existence is to improve the management of allergies and related diseases of the immune system in the United Kingdom, though education, training and research. As allergy embraces many subspecialties in medicine, the BSACI decided to set up special interest groups with a remit to promote understanding of the contribution of Allergy to diseases within these disciplines and thus improve management. In addition regular regional meetings are arranged across the UK for primary and secondary care professionals to raise awareness in Allergy and initiate education focused on the community practice of this specialty. Bulgarian National Society of Allergology Aim: The aim of Bulgarian Society of Allergology is to be a legal partner for specialists in the field of allergy and clinical immunology. Our task in promoting better care for allergy patients was highlighted by the increasing the number, the diversity in sensitization patterns and the severity of allergic diseases. In 1990 \"Clinical Allergology\" was recognized as a separate specialty which contributed to the better qualification of the allergy specialists in Bulgaria. Founded: 1973 History: The Bulgarian Society of Allergology was founded back in the late 1973. Its aim was to be a legal partner for the practitioners. Our task in promoting better care for allergy patients was highlighted by the increasing number of allergy patients, their diversity in sensitization patterns, and the increasing severity of allergic diseases. Throughout the years the Bulgarian Society of Allergology was guided by Professor P. Kirchev, Professor G. Kosturkov, Professor J. Mileva, and Professor V. Dimitrov. Our current Society President is Professor Bogdan Petrunov. In 1990, Clinical Allergology was recognized as a separate medical specialty which contributed to the better qualification of the allergy specialists in Bulgaria. Since 1991 the Bulgarian Society of Allergology became a member of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI). The Bulgarian Society of Allergology is a member in Good Standing of the World Allergy Organization (WAO) since 2001. Croatian Society of Allergology and Clinical Immunology Czech Society of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (CSAKI) Mission: Promoting high-quality standard treatment of patients with allergic and immunopathological diseases, participation in organizing education, defining diagnostic and treatment standards, and promoting high-quality research in the fields of allergology clinical immunology Founded: 1957 Background: Members are not only allergology and immunology professionals (including nurses and technicians) but also other medical specialists interested in the field, as well as researchers in theoretical immunology.

The Danish Society for Allergology comprises medical doctors, researchers in Allergology, nurses and people from the industry with an interest in Allergology. The Danish Health Board abolished the specialty as a distinct entity against the advice of our society in 2004. Since then, the Danish Society for Allergology has established a 2-year sub-specialization in Allergology, and the pediatricians in Denmark already have a 3-year sub-specialization, according to UEMS (the European Union of Medical Specialists). The society organizes a two-day annual meeting in August and also a thematic winter meeting. The society has a home page (in Danish). The society tries to promote the importance of clinical allergy and allergy research in the public opinion and in health politics and offers advice to the Danish Health Board in issues regarding allergy. History The Danish Society for Allergy Research was founded in 1946. Other Nordic countries also had allergy societies and collaboration with them led to one of the first European scientific journals, Acta Allergologica (later Allergy). Given that in other European countries and in the US allergists were treating immunological diseases, the name of the society was changed in 1966 to the Danish Society for Allergology and Immunology. However, in Denmark immunological diseases were primarily treated by other specialties and, as a consequence, the name was changed again in 1985 to the Danish Society for Allergology. In the early years, it was a sister society of the Society for Immunology but, since 1992, it has been an independent society, and there is a separate Danish Society for Clinical Immunology. Dutch Association for Allergology and Clinical Immunology (NVvAKI) The Dutch Association for Allergology and Clinical Immunology (NVvAKI) is an association for physicians and non-medical professionals who are professionally involved in allergology and clinical immunology.

Also related, in 2009 and 2012, the Cuban Society of Allergology has endorsed and co-organized, with the Cuban Immunology Society, two international meetings on allergen vaccines. History When the Society was founded in 1948, few professionals were dedicated to the allergy field. With the specialty recognition in 1960 by the present Cuban Ministry of Public Health, the human resources training work started and the first specialists graduated in 1977. From that moment on, new professionals enter every year into the specialty, and the association changed its name into Cuban Society of Allergy, Asthma and Clinic Immunology in 2008. Currently, its goal is to incorporate all the specialty professionals, 260 Allergologists existing to date. It also schedules various training courses and events every year.

Founded: 1923 History The evolution of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) dates back to the early 1920s with the founding of two professional organizations: the Society for the Study of Asthma and Allied Conditions (on the East Coast) and the American Association for the Study of Allergy (on the West Coast). In 1943, these two entities joined forces to become one stronger, integrated professional society called the American Academy of Allergy. Although its name has changed, the Academy's mission has remained the same: the advancement of the knowledge of allergy, asthma and immunology for optimal patient care. Publishing Cutting-Edge Research The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, (JACI) the official publication of the AAAAI, took root in 1929 with the first edition of The Journal of Allergy. Eight decades later, this journal is the most cited journal in the allergy / immunology specialty. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (launched in January 2013) covers the spectrum of diseases in the allergy / immunology specialty, with an emphasis on practical clinical research and the latest recommendations for diagnosis and treatment. Funding Research and Training The AAAAI has long recognized the need for development of academic leaders to attract and train future allergist / immunologists. In 1948, the Academy offered its first funding for four fellows-in-training with an annual stipend of $3,000 each. To date, the AAAAI has funded awards totaling more than $4 million, much of this through the Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Education and Research Organization, Inc. Presenting the Latest Advances The Academy's first Annual Meeting in 1944 was a two day event with four sessions and 23 presentations.
