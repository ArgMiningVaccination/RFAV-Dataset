We're about a 20-minute drive from Detroit, MI.", "sitename": "Cutler Integrative Medicine |", "date": "2021-02-08", "cleaned_text": "Naturopathic medicine is \"the medicine of the future\" NOW. Dr. Cutler's expertise is getting to the root cause, not just treating symptoms. Naturopathic doctors are THE world experts in natural medicine. He trained under the top environmental medicine doctors in the country. He has the most advanced training in genetic polymorphisms in Michigan. He looks at the link between mental, emotional, physical, and environmental well-being. He understands patients problems first hand, as he also suffered from illness. He spends quality time with you and has that personal touch patients really need. Dr. Cutler will find what other doctors never found with your health. Homeopaths and acupuncturists use only one modality to help an individual's problem, whereas Naturopathic doctors use many modalities, along with proper testing to get to the root, and tailor a program for your individual health goals and needs. In addition, naturopathic doctors have eight years of extensive medical schooling, which helps to see the big picture of someone's health and put all the pieces of the puzzle together. Known as the experts in natural medicine, naturopathic doctors (NDs) integrate the ancient wisdom of nature with the modern research of science. NDs are medically trained as primary care physicians and undergo medical training similar in structure and scope to that of medical and osteopathic doctors. Additionally, NDs are trained in naturopathic disciplines that include clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, homeopathic medicine, hydrotherapy, and lifestyle counseling. Therefore, it is important to validate that your naturopathic doctor is qualified and has graduated from an accredited medical school approved by the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians. Instead of tearing off a prescription for a pharmaceutical to suppress a specific symptom, NDs explore the big picture\u2014the physical, emotional, genetic, spiritual, environmental, and social factors that affect overall health. While they do work to identify and alleviate symptoms, they primarily investigate and treat the underlying causes of illness, often the combination of nutritional or biochemical dysfunctions, lifestyle, genetics, environmental toxicants, as well as the mind, emotions, and beliefs. An ND's rigorous academic curriculum incorporates training in the medical sciences, including anatomy, physiology, immunology, histology, embryology, microbiology, biochemistry, and neuroscience. A typical ND visit is scheduled for an hour, during which your current complaints, entire medical history, and lifestyle are examined. NDs take a holistic approach and often work to prevent illness by focusing on the human body's ability to self-heal. NDs don't just treat the diagnosis; they treat the individual. Do you have no current health issues but have the desire to prevent future health problems? Naturopathic medicine can still play an important role in optimizing your health. Whether it is improving your diet, nutritional supplementation, preventing illness, or reducing the risk of diseases, naturopathic medicine can help you achieve these goals. Instead of reading a few popular books on natural health or attending a weekend conference on nutrition, Naturopathic Physicians are medically trained from the \"ground up\" in natural medicine. An ND has the proper training to look at the bigger picture of an individual's health and then take that information and use it in a protocol in the proper amount, combinations, and correct therapies, to ultimately lead to unparalleled health. A holistic MD, for example, might still do five-minute patient visits and give you thyroid medication for your low thyroid performance, but Dr. Cutler will look beyond to see what is causing your thyroid to underperform in the first place. There are very few Licensed Naturopathic Physicians here in Michigan. Dr. Cutler is a Licensed ND and uses the widest range of therapies and testing methods to get to the root of the problem of illness. Dr. Cutler specializes in integrative and naturopathic medicine, emphasizing environmental medicine (how environmental toxicants impact health). His passion and expertise are helping patients achieve optimal health while spending quality time with a new patient and performing conventional and specialty type labs as needed. "}
