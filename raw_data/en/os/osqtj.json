I'm so grateful to have Dr. Lindsay as an incredible resource for holistic care for my children. She is thoughtful, thorough, and I know she genuinely cares about my children's well-being. I so appreciate how you make sure to answer as many questions as you can and that you make good use of our time together. That created a lot of trust for me. As a Naturopathic Doctor in the State of Colorado, vaccinations are not in our scope of practice, however we are happy to help you develop a vaccine plan. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. We believe in educated and informed parent choice. Each child is treated as an individual. We come up with an action plan based on your goals & work together using our combined intuition, wisdom & evidence-based protocols. And we always celebrate our wins along the way! Naturopathic pediatricians are great for chronic care! Things like eczema, constipation, and poor behavior are symptoms that act as clues. We follow those clues to find out what area of the body is struggling, and solve the problem holistically. We accept all major credit cards & Health Savings Accounts (HSA). We don't accept insurance because in doing so, we become restricted in the type of care we can provide. We believe the most ethical way to provide health care is to work directly for YOU. Lab work, however, is typically covered by insurance and we can help you navigate that. Our visits are relaxed and friendly. You're invited to share your concerns, ideas & goals. You can expect me to ask lots of questions! This will help me align with your goals and come up with a plan that fits your personally, values & preferences. Yes! We believe naturopathic care IS primary care. Well child exams are about more than height, weight, and vaccinations. We take the time to help you establish a foundation of health. YES! We use a combination of conventional labs + specialized testing. In most cases, we get more benefit from specialized labs that assess for function rather than disease. We don't run unnecessary labs and the rule of thumb is that if the lab result wouldn't change the course of treatment, we don't run it. Group coaching is the most affordable way to get your questions answered by a Naturopathic Pediatrician. Groups are small & intimate, and you'll likely find value by listening to the questions of other like-minded parents. Plus, you get access to our most popular protocols, classes & a private chat community. [Try it for a month](https://l.bttr.to/2dzvr) and cancel any time!
