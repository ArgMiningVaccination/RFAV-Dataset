Parental concern about the safety of childhood vaccines increased significantly during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, although confidence in vaccines remained high, according to research published in Pediatrics. A separate study published in MMWR reported disruptions in meningococcal and Tdap vaccination among adolescents. The study reported in Pediatrics analyzed the survey responses of 1,488 parents from April 1 to April 28, 2020, a period that marked the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Feb. 1 to March 30, 2022, a period later in the pandemic. Although there was an increase in the percentage of parents who agreed that vaccines hold \"important benefits\" (89.5% to 92.5%) and that they are \"useful and effective\" (89.3% to 93.2%), the percentage of parents who agreed that vaccines were associated with illness or death increased by 13.2 percentage points (18.3% to 31.5% \u2014 a 72% increase) and the percentage who agreed they caused harmful side effects increased by 6.1 percentage points (26.7% to 32.8%). \"We conclude that parent concern about the safety of routine childhood vaccines has increased nationally since the start of the pandemic,\" they wrote. The report in MMWR included data from the 2015 to 2021 National Immunization Survey-Teen, which showed a drop in vaccination coverage with the first doses of MenACWY and Tdap among younger adolescents. Among adolescents born in 2008, the percentage receiving one or more MenACWY doses by age 13 years dropped by 5.1 percentage points , and the percentage receiving Tdap by age 12 years dropped by 4.1 percentage points. The authors recommended that providers review vaccination histories during every clinical encounter \u2014including those for COVID-19 vaccination \u2014 to identify patients who have fallen behind. The authors of the Pediatrics brief noted that although parents were concerned with vaccine safety, confidence in the benefits and effectiveness of childhood vaccines remained high. \"Our findings underscore the important role of pediatricians in addressing parents' concerns about childhood vaccines, as they are highly trusted by parents about vaccinations and can address vaccine hesitancy,\" they wrote. \"Pediatricians should therefore ask hesitant parents about their particular concerns and be prepared to address safety concerns.\" The COVID-19 pandemic caused a decrease in well-child visits and vaccinations in the United States. Parental hesitancy for pediatric COVID-19 vaccines and widespread vaccine misinformation during the pandemic may have affected parental confidence in routine childhood vaccines. Until now, there have been few studies on this issue. The study in Pediatrics used longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample to determine how parents' confidence in childhood vaccines changed during the pandemic. Researchers analyzed data from the Understanding America Study. Nearly 9,500 participants were enrolled via the internet using address-based sampling. Surveys were distributed twice a week from spring 2020 to winter 2021, then monthly through the summer of 2021. Additional surveys were also given in the fall of 2021 and winter of 2022. Participants were asked if they agreed with four statements about childhood vaccines. Researchers examined trends in the percentage of parents who strongly agreed or agreed with each statement. From April 2020 to March 2022, the percentage of parents who agreed with the \"important benefits\" and \"useful and effective\" statements remained stable and high, ranging from 89.5% to 92.5% and from 89.3% to 93.2%, respectively. By contrast, the percentage of parents who agreed with the illness or death and harmful side effects statements increased significantly by 13.2 percentage points. In this national sample, the proportion of parents concerned about the safety and side effects of routine childhood vaccines increased significantly between April 2020 and March 2022, although parental confidence in the benefits and effectiveness of childhood vaccines remained high. Limitations of this study include the generalizability of online data and insufficient sample sizes for certain racial and ethnic groups. However, the study findings highlight the important role of pediatricians in addressing parents' concerns about childhood vaccines and hesitancy.

As we approach 3 years since SARS-CoV-2 was first detected, we continue to learn about its deleterious impact on our lives. Global orphanhood, decreased life expectancy and increased disparities in health access and outcomes continue to stun us. This month in Pediatrics, Shah and colleagues have been able to quantify the magnitude of one of the most meaningful impacts of the pandemic: decrease in parental confidence in childhood vaccinations beyond COVID-19. Vaccines are an essential component of public health because they protect the individual and their community. The authors show an increase of 13.2 percentage points in the proportion of parents who agreed that vaccines lead to illness or deaths and of 6.1 percentage points in the proportion of parents agreeing that childhood vaccines have many known harmful side effects. The sample did not allow for additional analysis to further discriminate which factors among parents were the main drivers of these changes, and additional studies to further identify these are urgently needed. Vaccine hesitancy is a complex and often irrational problem that cannot be overcome just with knowledge. The health care system rewards quantity instead of quality, and we are often faced with limited time to have meaningful conversations with our patients and families. In addition, in this fast-paced world, the ability to pause, listen and take time to address this issue is increasingly challenging. Even more worrisome is the lack of preparation and resources we have to counteract the well-funded and prepared disinformation operation. We should expect this to worsen over time as we continue to lose ground against the antivaccine movement. Although we, as pediatricians, can exercise patience, time, and empathy to tackle this problem, a coalition of disciplines, health policy, communicators and advocacy groups is fundamental to address the complexity of human behavior in health and disease.
