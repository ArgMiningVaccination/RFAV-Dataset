Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is based on a totally different concept than Western medicine.It does not only consider single factors being re-sponsible for a certain disease but the unbalancedstatus of the whole organism ( \"holism \") and its interaction with the environment. Relevant tothis are seasonal and geographical variations. In brief, the human body is centered around five\"zang \"organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung and kid- ney), which are connected by meridians interact-ing with the exterior by sensory organs and orifi-ces. Viscera, though different in function, interactwith each other. Thus, diseases will have an im-pact not on one but on several organs, and maybeAbstract ! One of the general hurdles limiting the applica-tion and development of traditional Chinesemedicines (TCM) is their occasional poor or in-consistent quality. Being multi-component mix-tures, however, assuring the quality of such prep-arations is a challenging task. In recent years sig-nificant analytical advancements and innovationswere made in relation to this particular problemamong others. This review summarizes respectivereports within the last five years, and reflects themultitude of current methods the analyst canchoose from. Besides established techniques, suchas HPLC or IR Fin-gerprinting techniques, which are especially pop-ular for analyzing TCM remedies, are also men-tioned.

Therapy starts with differentiation of the syn- drome (e.g., based on particular symptoms, patient counselling,pulse taking and palpation), followed by an appropriate treat-ment. The latter includes the use of mostly complex herbal prep-arations, acupuncture or moxibustion (stimulation of acupunc-ture points by heat treatment). Due to the holistic approach ofTCM the same disease might show different syndromes, there-fore requiring a different form of treatment [1 -3]. Alternative medicines including TCM, Ayurveda and others areincreasingly becoming popular in the Western world. They aretrendy and considered less harmful because of their \"natural \"in- gredients. This is definitely not true as indicated by toxic side ef-fects of particular herbs or adulterations [4 -6]. The situation is further complicated by the fact that some of these products aredistributed via the internet, without any assurance of correctplant identification or quality. Regulatory institutions and thescientific community are aware of this problem, and work onthe development of analytical methods for quality control of re-spective ingredients and preparations ( l \"Fig. 1 shows SciFinder hits for the combined search terms \"TCM \"and \"analysis \"listed by publication year). The technique by far most commonly ap-plied for this purpose is HPLC (in approx. 60% of all relevant2008 publications utilized), followed by GC and CE. It is notewor-thy that most of the reports describe the analysis of single herbalcomponents in TCM plants and not in the entire complex formu-lation.The goal of this review is to summarize recent developments inthe analysis of TCM preparations, whereby the format of a mini-review does not allow a comprehensive evaluation of the wholetopic. However, an informative and excellent review has recentlybeen published by Liu et al. [7]. Therefore, in this manuscript rou-tine techniques such as the above-mentioned ones will onlybriefly be addressed, focusing on more uncommon and innova-tive approaches instead. The observed period includes the lastfive years (2004 to 2008), considering publications in English on-ly. Separation techniques are also involved in sample preparationprior to actual analysis; recent advancements in this area (e.g.,MAR, MIP) have been addressed elsewhere already [7 -9].Chromatographic Methods ! High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) Numerous applications of LC in combination with various detec- tors can be found in the literature for the assessment of TCM.They include, to name a few, analysis of \"Qi-Shen-Yi-Qi prepara- \"by prescriptions using LC TOF MS [12]. A comparably new trend is the of sub-2 \u00b5m stationary phasesfor separation (UPLC, RRLC, RSLC). These materials show dramat-ically increased separation efficiency at simultaneously reducedseparation time, but result in much higher column backpressure.In addition to \"fast\"detectors with a high sampling rate, special pumps enabling pressures up to 1000 bar are therefore required.Several species of the Panax genus have been investigated by this technique, for example Chan and coworkers studied raw andsteamed Panax notoginseng [13]. By (Waters Aquity C-18; 100 \u00d7 2.1 mm) and a mobile phase com-prising water and 0.1% of formic acid in acetonitrile they wereable to assign all major ginsenosides (23 compounds) in less than8 min. Respective compounds were identified based on referencestandards and TOF MS data. Similar applications on the above- mentioned species as well as P. ginseng, P. japonicus and P. quin- quefolium were described in two other reports [14,15]. According to the Chinese pharmacopoeia \"Yin-Yang-Huo \", several different Epimedium species are comprised under this name, can be used to lower blood pressure and to treat diabetes. In order to differ-entiate these species based on their flavonoid pattern Chen et al.have developed a respective UPLC l \"Fig. 2 [16]. Plant ma- was first extracted with 70% ethanol using ASE conditions(120\u00b0C at 1500 psi), and then separated on a 5-cm long AquityBEH C-18 column. In only 13 min a total of 15 flavonoid glyco-sides could be separated in herbal samples and quantified by UVdetection with excellent sensitivity (LOD from 0.05 to 0.13 ng)and precision (RSD for intraday precision 3.1%). Technically similar applications are those by Jin et al. on the analysis of qui-nochalcones in Carthamus tinctorius [17] and three marker com- pounds in Eleutherococcus senticosus [18]. Whenever very polar compounds are to be analyzed by reversedphase chromatography insufficient retention is a commonly ob-served problem. It can be overcome by the use of ion-pairing re- Fig. 1 Number of SciFinder database hits when using the search terms \"TCM \"and\"analysis \".

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. agents or novel HILIC materials. The latter show selectivity simi- lar to normal phase, but aqueous mobile phases (water has thehighest solvent strength on this phase) can be employed [19].An interesting application of this technique on TCM productswas reported by Wang and coworkers in 2008 [20]. They usedcolumn-switching (column 1: Atlantis HILIC silica, mobile phase:acetonitrile and 100 mM aqueous 2:Hypersil ODS 2, mobile phase: 0.1% formic acid in water and ace-tonitrile) to separate polar (column 1) as well as non-polar (col-umn 2) constituents in Lonicera japonica . The system comprised two sets of LC modules, which were hyphenated through an in-terface with an electronically controlled valve. Through this in-terface transfer and separation of those analytes not retained oncolumn 1 was achieved on column 2; detection of the individualanalytes was carried out at 254 nm.Another rather uncommon approach for studying the composi-tion of herbal material and TCM preparations in particular is theuse of two-dimensional HPLC. Like the above-described systemtwo columns are required, but after separation on the first col-umn small portions of the eluent are trapped (online or offline),and then assayed on the second one. Both columns need to havedifferent separation mechanisms, and the separation of the sec-ond dimension must not be less than the resolution of the firstcolumn [21]. If these requirements are fulfilled, total componentanalysis with high resolution is possible. Hu et al. studied two im-portant TCM plants, material flow rate0.13 mL/min), the eluent trapped online in a loop, and rapidly an-alyzed on a Chromolith monolithic column from Merck (50 \u00d74.6 mm, flow rate 3.0 mL/min). For both separations, gradientelution with aqueous acidic acetonitrile was used, and detectionwas achieved by UV and MS. After visualization of the results in a3-D plot more than 100 compounds could be separated and iden-tified in both plants, respectively. The offline coupling of two col-umns (separation and fractionation on the first, analysis of thefractions on the second column, and combination of results) hasbeen described as well. By combining HILIC (in-house made clickCD material) and reversed phase material (Inertsil ODS) the composition of Carthamus tinctorius was studied TCM preparation composed of eight herbal ingredients; 54components could be separated, and seven identified based onMS data [24]. Gas chromatography (GC) Gas chromatography has always been and most likely will be themethod of choice for analyzing essential oils. As such, numerousGC applications on TCM relevant herbs can be found in the recentliterature, many of them utilizing MS for detection. In respect toseparation and detection little new is described compared to ear-lier reports. What seems to be more interesting are advance-ments regarding sample preparation. For example, a procedurecommonly applied is headspace solid-phase microextraction(HS-SPME). In a first step volatile constituents are transferredfrom the matrix to the headspace phase by thermal or microwaveheating. They are adsorbed on suitable SPME materials (fiberscoated with stationary phases such as polysiloxanes or divinyl-benzene) and then desorbed in the GC apparatus at increasedtemperature again. Once a suitable SPME material has been se-lected, the simple, fast and solvent-free extraction and enrich-ment of particular compounds is possible. Successful applications of this technique on TCM plants include the analysis of ligusti-lides in Ligusticum chuanxiong [25], the essential that of Artemisia argyi flowers [28]. A modification of the aforementioned procedure is HS-SDME,whereby SD stands for single droplet. Here, the analytes are ex-tracted using a single microdrop (1 -5 \u00b5L) of solvent such as octa- nol or benzyl alcohol, which is placed in the headspace phasethrough the tip of a microsyringe. After an appropriate time at asuitable temperature, the droplet is withdrawn into the syringe,and analyzed by MS. Deng and coworkers determined the con-tent of paeonol prepared an aqueous extract by microwave-assisted extraction, and thenextracted the target compound in a single 1 \u00b5L drop of octanol.Exposure time was 4 min at a temperature of 50\u00b0C and stirringrate of 700 rpm. With RSD values of less than 10.5% for repeatedanalysis and recoveries for paeonol of over 88% the authors con-sidered this method to be well suited for routine analysis. In asimilar fashion the analysis of Z-ligustilide, one of the biologically active constituents in Angelica sinensis essential oil, in rabbit plasma has been described [30]. High speed counter current chromatography (HSCCC) High speed counter current chromatography is a support-freeliquid-liquid partition chromatographic technique invented byIto and Bowman in the early 1970s [31]. By eliminating the useof a solid stationary phase loss of constituents due to irreversibleadsorption is avoided. Instead, two immiscible solvents or mix-tures thereof are employed, with the stationary phase being re-tained in a coil of flexible length by centrifugal forces and the mo-bile phase driven through the system by external pumping. Thecompounds of interest are separated based on their different par-tition coefficients. More details regarding separation theory andinstrumental set-up can be found in a very informative recent re-view by Ito [32].Because of scale-up options and obvious advantages compared tocolumn chromatography (see above) this technique is mainlyused for preparative purposes rather than analytical applications.Especially for the isolation of constituents from TCM remediesHSCCC has gained some popularity, and Liu and coworkers havealready compiled these methods in their review [7]. As can beseen, mainly the isolation described, and reported purities of usually more than 95%impressively demonstrate the potential of this approach.Analytical reports utilizing HSCCC are scarce. One example withTCM relevance is the study published by Wang et al. [33]. Theypresent three ), concluding that they consider HSCCC suitable for controlling the quality of herbal raw materials.However, only qualitative results are presented, but particularlythe separation of biphenyls (magnolol and honokiol) in a crudeethanolic extract of M. officinalis seems promising ( l \"Fig. 3 ). The solvent system comprised a mixture of n-hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol and water, in the ratio of 1:0.4:1:0.4. Separationswere performed in an analytical separation column of 36 mL vol-ume, at a revolution speed of 1800 rpm, and flow rate of 2.0 mL/min. For detection a UV VIS photometer set to 254 nm was uti- lized. HSCCC has also been employed for fingerprint analysis ofTCM preparations, particularly those containing Salvia miltiorrhi-778 Ganzera M.

Capillary electrophoresis (CE) Capillary electrophoresis offers many unique features and modesthat explain why this technique is increasingly used for naturalproducts analysis. Separation is commonly achieved by the differ-ent mobility of charged analytes in an electric field, either inaqueous (FSCE) or non-aqueous buffers (NACE). If non-chargedmolecules are to electrolytes with charged pseudo-stationary phases formed by micelles (MEKC) or solvent droplets(MEEKC) can be employed. These techniques are especially popu-lar among Chinese researchers. Therefore, listing of all TCM re-lated applications would go far beyond the scope of this minire-view, especially as a recent review by Ganzera has covered thistopic in detail [34]. Capillary electrochromatography (CEC) This technique utilizes the same driving force as capillary electro-phoresis, which is the electro-osmotic flow, but separation isachieved because of chromatographic interaction. Therefore CECcan be considered as the true hybrid of HPLC and CE, combiningthe benefits of both, i.e., high separation efficiency and low sam-ple/solvent consumption. Stationary phase (e.g., regular RP-18material with small particle size) is either filled in silica capil-laries with an internal diameter of around 100 \u00b5m, or it is in situ polymerized in the capillaries. The latter are called monolithiccolumns, whereby silica and synthetic polymer (e.g., methacry-late, divinylbenzene) based monoliths have been described. SinceCEC is a comparatively new development, only a few applicationswith reference to TCM can be found in the literature.The use of packed CEC capillaries is described nucleosides ( \"Yin-Hang-Huo \") [37]. In all of these reports the same sta- tionary phase was selected (3 \u00b5m Hypersil C-18 material), butthe mobile phases employed were slightly different. For example,Chen et al. [37] achieved optimum results with a mixture of20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 4.0) and acetonitrile in the ratio of7:3. The applied voltage and temperature were 30 kV and 25\u00b0C, respectively. With these settings an excellent separation of eightflavonoids was accomplished in less than 20 min, also enablingtheir quantitative determination in crude plant material (LOD ofindividual flavonoids between 4.1 to 8.6 \u00b5g/mL).Nearly all of the few reports regarding the application of mono-lithic CEC materials describe the use of polymeric materials. Thisis explainable by the fact that they, even containing no secondarystructure (mesopores), are easier to prepare and more pH-stablethan silica-based ones [38]. For example, L\u00fc elaborated on thequantitative determination of structurally related anthraqui-nones in rhubarb on a stationary phase directly polymerized in100 [39]. A prepared in 1-propanol and 1,4-butane-diol, and polymerization was thermally induced by azobisisobu-tyronitrile. For the actual separation of plant extracts a 10 mMphosphate buffer pH 6.2 containing 65% acetonitrile was used.Zhang and coworkers reported on the analysis of flavonoids inAdinandra nitida leaves on similar monoliths [40]. This plant is commonly utilized in TCM because of its antitumor properties.Since isocratic conditions did not allow the separation of all com-pounds of interest, the amount of acetonitrile in a phosphate buf-fer was gradually increased during analysis. Quantitative resultsfor apigenin and epicatechin in A. nitida samples were presented as well.The composition of the polymerization mixture is quite flexible,to the effect that stationary phases with diverse chromatographicproperties can be prepared rather easily. One option in this re-spect is the introduction of charged functionalities, thereby pro-ducing CEC materials with ion-exchange character. Accordingly,the analysis of alkaloids cation-exchange monoliths has in (l \"Fig. 4 , [41]) and opium [42]. Although the successful application on plant extracts hasbeen demonstrated in these studies, they are mainly focused onmechanistic investigations, and detailed quantitative results arelacking.

They combine speed and non-destructive character with the need for no or only little samplepreparation. This might be the reason why NIR spectroscopy isespecially popular for purity or identity evaluation in industry.Quantitative determinations are possible as well, but they re-quire external calibration with a \"conventional \"method (e.g., GC, HPLC) prior to actual analysis [43]. Further methodologicaldetails can be found in a respective review article in this issue.Few reports on quantitative IR applications have been publishedin connection to TCM. Applications for fingerprinting are sum-marized in the next section. Wu and colleagues described theuse of MIR and NIR spectroscopy for the quantitative determina-tion of -pinene, methyl salicylate and eugenol in \"Honghua oil\" [44]. This preparation is composed of several essential oils (win-tergreen, turpentine, glove and cassia leaf) and is utilized in thetreatment of rheumatism and joint problems. For the compoundsof interest, characteristic absorption bands in the IR spectra wereassigned, and based on quantitative GC results, the areas of thesebands were correlated with the respective quantities. Afterwards,constructed calibration curves showed correlation coefficients of0.98 and higher, and the predicted quantitative results were ingood agreement with GC (prediction bias varied from 0.143 to 0.178). Results obtained based on the MIR spectra were shown tobe slightly more precise.Another study related to heavy metals in TCM formulations is al-so noteworthy. By using thermolysis and atomic absorption spec-troscopy Huang et al. investigated mercury levels in 11 productsand two single plants (liquorice and Alisma orientalis ; [45]). All specimens contained mercury, with the highest content of23 \u00b5g/g (!) found in one commercial product. The product s exact composition was not specified, but results like these definitely in-dicate serious risks for the consumers.Fingerprinting ! An analytical approach that is especially employed on TCM ismost likely to be fingerprinting. It does not denote the use of par-ticular techniques but encompasses a unique style of data evalu-ation. Due to the complex composition of herbal drugs in general,and of multi-herb formulations in particular, this approach hasseveral advantages for the quality evaluation of TCM prepara-tions compared to conventional analysis. The latter usually ena-bles the quantitative determination of individual compounds(marker compounds) that are either unique for a particular spe-cies or responsible for biological activity. But they fail to provide acomplete picture of a herbal product composed of a multitude ofconstituents, whether they are active or not, specific or common.Fingerprinting tries to overcome this weakness by establishingchromatographic, patterns.Based on the \"similarity \"and \"integrity \"of these patterns in comparison to a reference (e.g., clinically proven product), au-thentication and identification of herbal medicines is possibleeven when the amount of characteristic constituents is not thesame [46,47]. It is not required to resolve all compounds in theextract, but if certain compounds are separated, quantitative de-terminations are also possible.Since 2004 the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration(SFDA) requires all injections made from TCM raw materials tobe standardized using chromatographic fingerprints [47]. But, ascan be seen in l \"Table 1 , the vast number of respective reports is not limited to injectibles alone or to chromatographic methods[48-61]. Most of the reports describe the application on a single plant and not multi-herb preparations. In many cases HPLC is uti-lized as Concerning multi-plant preparations, the standardizationof\"Danning tablets \"[60] and \"Longdan-Xiega n decoction \"[61]Table 1 Recent examples of fingerprint analysis of TCM plants and preparations.

The latter comprises 10 medicinal plants including Gentianae radix, Scutellarae radix,Plantaginis HPLC was used. The firstseparation was achieved on silica material modified with humanserum albumin (therefore the authors used the term biochroma-tography for their study). The second separation was performedon a silica monolithic column. More than 100 compounds couldbe separated, with 19 of them being identified based on theirmass spectra. Compared to routine approaches the authors con-sidered their method advantageous because of \"enhanced peak capacity, good sensitivity and powerful resolution \". Different strategies for evaluating results can be found in the lit-erature, but the majority of reports were done either using prin-cipal component analysis (PCA) or the commercially availablesoftware \"Similarity for chromatographic fin- gerprint of TCM \"(Chinese Pharmacopoeia Committee, 2004). Based on peak areas, retention times, and after assigning markerpeaks, a mean chromatogram is generated. This is compared withthe actually obtained results, and based on the calculated corre-lation coefficient sample consistency can be determined [48].Metabolomic profiling can be seen as another form of fingerprintanalysis, aiming to identify the complete set of metabolites in tis-sues or cells without bias. Currently NMR- or MS-based ap-proaches are mainly used for this purpose whereby the sample(e.g., plant extract) is directly determined without any prior sep-aration. Once again, the profiles obtained are observed for com-pound specific signals or the total fingerprint is compared [62].Besides recent reviews [63,64], another contribution to this issueofPlanta Medica further elaborates on these particular tech- niques. Hence, only a few successful applications on plants withTCM relevance are mentioned here. They include fresh ginsengroots [68]. Other Approaches ! Alternative methods for controlling the quality of TCM not de- scribed in the previous sections are the biological approaches. Afew interesting reports can be found in current literature, such asthe quantitative determination of saikosaponins in several Bu- the analysis of acid in diverse preparations by ELISA(enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [70]); or using gene ex-pression for this purpose [71]. In the last example human hepato-cellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) were used as a \"dynamic detec- tor\". They were incubated with a complex TCM decoction, and the expression on selected marker genes was monitored by quan-titative PCR analysis. Compared to HPLC results this biologicalmethod was shown to be equally capable of distinguishing be-tween different batches of the investigated decoction. Conclusions ! According to EMEA (European Medicines Agency) guidelines onthe \"Quality of herbal medicinal products \"for each herbal sub- stance and preparation a comprehensive specification is re-quired. Agreement with these specifications has to be confirmedby control tests, allowing the qualitative and quantitative deter-mination of active substances or specific markers [72]. As shown in this review, within the last few years a multitude of new tech-niques and applications has been developed and reported, so thattools for resolving this quality problem seem to be available.Whether consumers will actually benefit from this improved sit-uation or not is now up to the willingness of regulatory affairsand manufacturers.
