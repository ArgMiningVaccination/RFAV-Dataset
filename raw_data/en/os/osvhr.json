Our members subscribe to the tenet that ethical business practices are an integral component of a sustainable industry. Consumers are able to recognis e member companies that adhere with this philosophy by their use of the CMA Logo. 1.3 A sustainable complementary medicines industry relies on every company involved voluntarily complying with the provisions of this Code . 1.4 The Australian complementary medicine s industry promotes the concept of preventative health and wellbeing via the provision of high quality , low-risk products that are self -selected by consumers or prescribed by healthcare professionals . 1.5 Complementary medicines are included under the quality use of therapeutic products , which is based on genuine consumer health needs and supported by the ethical conduct of all parties . The quality use of therapeutic products means: selecting diagnostic and treatment options wisely based on the best a vailable evidence and the consumer's needs; choosing suitable therapeutic products if this is considered necessary and using therapeutic products safely and effectively . 1.6 This Code may be referred to using the abbreviated title of the CMA Code of Practice .
