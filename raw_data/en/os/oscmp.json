With more than 67,000* businesses and 58 million* consumers globally, MINDBODY is uniquely positioned to offer insight into the relationship between the two. The MINDBODY Wellness Index is a proprietary statistical scoring algorithm that incorporates Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level anonymized and aggregated data from the MINDBODY marketplace, third-party data from sources such as the US Census, Google and other business listing services, and data from a large-scale MINDBODY consumer survey covering the largest 50 MSAs in the US. Nearly 17,000 individuals participated in a 16-minute online survey between Oct. 26 and Nov. 12, 2018. Survey participants spanned the ages of 18 to 65, with a mean age of 39. The sample was 49% male and 51% female. Seventy participants, or 0.4%, self- identify as an alternate gender. Due to low base size, this data isn't included in gender comparisons. In addition to the flagship The MINDBODY Wellness Index: Understanding the State of the Wellness Industry in America report, there are additional reports in the series that offer deeper insights into findings in fitness, integrative health, and beauty. Wellness providers can look at these trends to understand clients' needs and better support their goals. This report focuses on integrative health services in America. 3 | 2019 MINDBODY Wellness Index: Integrative Health in America What are integrative health services, and how important are they to Americans? Integrative health services are healing-oriented services that can address the full range of influences that affect a person's health. Integrative health services often incorporate both traditional and complementary approaches to healthcare\u2014to give a holistic view of a patient's health with all dimensions of wellness. 1 Use the glossary on page 17 to learn more about all the integrative services covered in this report. Americans spent $14.7 billion out-of-pocket on services from complementary practitioners over the course of a year. About one-third of this spend was for conventional services. 2 Around 30% of Americans prioritize integrative health through services like massage, acupuncture, chiropractic care, alternative healthcare, and personal coaching. Men tend to prioritize integrative health slightly more than women (32% versus 29%). Men also spend more money on integrative health services than women ($300 versus $228 annually). Despite this, fewer men have actually tried the more popular options, like massage and chiropractic care (56% versus 64% and 27% versus 32%). Overall, consumers ages 26-45 spend more per than and 46-65 year-olds addition, 37% of Americans go to an integrative health practitioner three or more times a year. The older age group engages less often in integrative health activities than their younger counterparts. Understanding the attitudes of different age groups and genders can help integrative health providers better target and serve their services (Services include massage, acupuncture, chiropractic, alternative healthcare, personal coaching, etc.) Frequency of getting integrative health services Annual spend on integrative health by ageIntegrat ive healt h services are a priori ty for me/I almost always prioritize int egrat ive healt h services I try to prioriti ze integrative healt h services when I can Integrat ive healt h services are a lo w priori ty in my life right now30% 40% 30% Once a mont h or more oftenAbout 3-6 times a yearLess than once a more oftenAbout 3-6 times a yearLess than once a 4.3 Annual spend on integrative health by gender4 | 2019 MINDBODY Wellness Index: Integrative in America Massag eC health service Massage is by far the top integrative health option, with 60% of consumers noting they have had a massage in the past 12 months. In 2005, massage therapy was predicted to be a $6-11 billion per year industry. By 2017, revenue was estimated to have been $16 billion in the US. 3 Chiropractic care comes in at a distant second (29%) in popularity of services received. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that the number of Americans who use chiropractors increased from 9.1% in 2012 to 10.3% in 2017. 4 As a result, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that chiropractor employment will grow 12% from 2016 to 2026\u2014an above average growth rate for all occupations. 5 Third in popularity is nutrition counseling (15%). The revenue for nutritionists and dietitians was $11 billion in 2018. 6 Job growth over the next ten years was estimated to be 14.6%. 7 Regardless of age, as seen on the following page, massage, and chiropractic care are the two most popular services utilized. Nutrition counseling and health/life coaching are also in the top five for all age groups. On the other hand, detox programs are more popular with younger age groups, and acupuncture is more popular with older age groups.

Health/life coaching is another option that interests younger consumers, making the top 10 for both men and women ages 18-25 (and men ages 26-45).
