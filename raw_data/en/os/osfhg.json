June 5, 2013 Annual Breast Is Best Conference Dover Downs Ballroom C Dover, DE 19901 Contact:: Lisl. Phelps@state.de.us As the weather warms up and everyone begins to go outside, it is important to keep in mind measures to take to keep yourself and your family safe. Like people, mosquitoes and ticks enjoy the warm weather. Not only are their bites itchy and annoying, but they can also transmit serious infections. Take measures to protect yourself and your family as you walk, bike, hike, and garden. Simple things like using insect repellant, draining standing water containers, and checking your body for ticks after outdoor activity can significantly reduce your risk of diseases like Lyme disease and West Nile virus. If you are travelling to exotic locations this summer, be sure to see your physician at least a few weeks before you travel. Ask them what shots and medications you need to protect yourself from getting sick overseas with such diseases as malaria, yellow fever , and travelers' diarrhea . Finally, at any time of year, if you are sexually active, it is important to practice safe sex by sticking to one (mutually faithful) partner and using condoms. This will help protect you from being infected with HIV, Hepatitis C, and other sexually transmitted diseases. Dr. Awele Maduka -Ezeh, DPH Medical Director Your emotional health is as important as your physical health.

Parents, it seems that a growing number of young kids are taking the \"Cinnamon Challenge\" -- a dangerous stunt landing kids in the hospital. The challenge is to swallow a tablespoon of ground cinnamon in 60 seconds without the help of a drink. Invariably, the taker ends up gagging and coughing up the spice -- creating a big brown cloud dubbed \"dragon breath.\" The danger is that cinnamon is composed of cellulose fibers that do not break down when they enter the lungs, possibly causing inflammation, thickening and scarring of the lungs. In just the first half of 2012, 122 calls were linked to misuse of the spice. At least 30 of these needed medical attention, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers \u2014some prob- lems as serious as a collapsed lung. This \"challenge\" can also trigger vomiting , which could be inhaled back into the lungs, potentially causing inflammation and infection known as aspiration pneumonia. Parents, know what your kids are viewing online, and talk with them about the potential dangers of seemingly harmless stunts.

Easy bruising is common with age, but can sometimes be a sign of a more serious problem, such as a blood -clotting problem or a blood disease. But some people \u2014 especially women \u2014 are just more prone to bruising than others. As you age, several factors can contribute to easy bruising, including aging capillaries that weaken and are more prone to rupture. Thinning skin is also a factor; with age, your skin thins, losing some of the protective fatty layer that helps cushion blood vessels from injury. Excessive exposure to the sun accelerates this process. When does easy bruising indicate a more serious problem? Consult your doctor if you have unusually large or painful bruises, especially if they seem to develop for no known reason, or have easy bruising and abnormal bleeding else- where, such as from your nose, gums or intestinal tract, suddenly begin bruising, especially if you recently started a new medication or develop bruising during an illness in addi- tion to fever or confusion. These signs can indicate low levels of or abnormally functioning platelets \u2014 components of blood that help it clot after an injury \u2014 or problems with proteins that help the blood clot. Bleeding disorders tend to run in families. Women normally bleed with menstruation and childbirth, so it may be hard to notice abnormal bleeding. In the United States, 1.5 to 4 million women have a diagnosed bleeding disorder. An addi- tional 2 million American women have a bleeding disorder and don't know it.

The average American gets nearly 20 times more than needed, which can make the body retain water. This increases the amount of fluid flow- ing through blood vessels, which can raise blood pressure. Most of the salt we consume comes from prepared and processed foods. Here are 5 ways to cut back on sodium: Use spices and other flavor enhancers - enhance the flavor with less sodium. Go nuts for healthy fats in the kitchen . Healthy fats, like nuts, can add a rich flavor to foods - minus the salt! Sear , saut\u00e9 , and roast . Searing , saut\u00e9ing , and roasting foods builds or brings out flavor. If you do steam or microwave food, perk up meals with a finishing drizzle of flavorful oil and a drop of citrus. Get whole grains from sources other than bread. Skip the extra salt with whole grains outside of baking, such as a Mediterranean whole -grain salad with vegeta- bles, nuts, legumes, a small amount of cheese, herbs and spices, and healthy oils, vinegar or citrus. Know your seasons . Shop for raw ingredients with maximum natural flavor and shop for peak -of-season produce at your local farm stand or supermarket.

May 12-18, 2013 Thanks to effective vaccine, the United States has been polio -free since 1979. But poliovirus is still a threat in some countries. Be part of the success story - get your child vaccinated on schedule. In the late 1940s to the early 1950s, polio crippled an average of more than 35,000 people in the United States each year. It was one of the most feared diseases of the twentieth century. Thanks to the polio vaccine, dedicated health care professionals, and parents who vaccinated their children on schedule, polio has been eliminated in the U.S. for over 30 years. It is crucial to maintain the success rate of U.S. vaccination efforts since the disease still exists in some parts of the world. People most at risk are those who never had polio vaccine, those who never received all the recom- mended vaccine doses, and those traveling to areas that could put them at risk for getting polio .Visit the U.S. State Department International Travel page, or the World Health Organization site for timely travel health information. Make sure you get your travel vaccination(s) well before your departure date to ensure complete protection. See your health care professional for more information. Celebrating Women's Health Week !

The National Women's History Project encourages discovering stories about our mothers , grandmothers , and great grandmothers to help us better understand their lives, the challenges they faced, and ultimately, ourselves and our own times. Recognizing the dignity and accomplishments of women in our own families and those from other back- grounds leads to higher self -esteem among girls and greater respect among boys and men. To ignore the vital role that women's dreams and accomplishments play in our own lives would be a great mistake . We draw strength and inspiration from those who came before us - and those remarkable women working among us today. They are part of our story, and a truly balanced and inclusive history recognizes how important women have always been in American society.

In 1858, Anna Jarvis, a young Appalachian homemaker, organized \"Mother's Work Days,\" where women worked to improve the sanitation and ultimately avert deaths from disease -bearing insects and seepage of polluted water. In 1872, Boston poet, pacifist, and women's suffragist Julia Ward Howe established a special day for mothers --and for peace. This wise woman felt that wars could be settled without bloodshed if the mothers of mankind interfered. Who bet- ter? Mothers alone bear the deepest pain from wars' wasted lives and know the true costs of war . Unfortunately , the tradi - tion of this special day of recognition fizzled out, and was eventually overlooked. In 1905, when Anna Jarvis died, her daughter, also named Anna, decided to memorialize her mother's lifelong activism, and began a campaign that culminated in 1914 when Congress passed a Mother's Day resolution. This assigned special day of recognition took hold and grew strong, becoming the celebration it is today. Now, on a well -deserved special day just for moms, millions of us remember our mothers with flowers and cards, burned but well-intentioned breakfasts , and macaroni jewelry , or sadly mourn the mothers we've lost and so appreciate . Lillian D. Wald (March 10, 1867 - September 1, 1940) was an American nurse, humanitarian and author known for contributions to human rights and as the founder of American community nursing. She founded the Henry Street Settlement and was an early advocate and activist for the rights of women and minorities. She campaigned for suffrage and was a supporter of racial integration. She was involved in the founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Wald died in 1940 at the age of 73. was given for the first time in 1997. It takes its name from the \"Kind Hearted Woman\" symbol of the Great Depression which became a way for one transient person to communicate to the next that the house outside at which the sign was scratched or drawn was a home where a meal might be obtained and human kindness was present. So the Kind Policy Award is not just recognition of housing achievements, but also a means of taking note of Delawareans who have helped to make our state a more hospitable place for our fellow citizens who are ill -housed, precariously housed, and homeless. Its essence is the treatment of fellow human beings in a way which conveys respect and equality, while attempting to empower them.

May 12-18, 2013 ADD, or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are not conditions seen solely in children; these disorders very much affect adults, sometimes with disastrous consequences. For those with ADD, it can be incredibly difficult to stay focused, be on time, keep organized, and complete some of the simplest tasks \u2014good intentions notwithstanding. For the spouse, parent, co -worker or general onlooker, this can be maddening! It may appear that he or she is witnessing a slacker in action, or an irresponsible day -dreamer - but this condition only appears to be a willpower problem; it is in fact a chemical issue within the management system of the brain. Many people with ADD learn to cope with the disorder throughout their lives; but as their level of responsibility mounts, the struggles do likewise, presenting challenges that may or may not be overcome alone. Undiagnosed and untreated ADD/ADHD can cause problems in virtually every area of a person's life ; health , careers , and relationships can and do suffer . But a d iagnosis can be a wonderful sense of relief and hope, which is why it is so important to recognize and respond to ADD/ADHD. Here are some of the most common signs or symptoms: Trouble concentrating and staying focused A tendency to overlook details Disorganization and forgetfulness Hyperfocus (losing track of time when doing enjoyable things) Impulsivity (interrupting people, shopping sprees) Emotional difficulties (mood swings, short temper, insecurity) Hyperactivity or restlessness (racing thoughts, fidgeting) People can take steps to improve things for themselves when they know they have ADD/ADHD: Exercise to work off excess energy and aggression Eat healthier, low -sugar diet to discourage mood swings Get 7 -8 hours of sleep daily. Being tired exaggerates ADD/ADHD symptoms. Practice better time management. Give yourself deadlines, take notes on everything, use timers or alarms to keep you on schedule, and complete tasks as they come in to avoid procrastination and work pile -up. Remember the importance of your personal relationships with the people you care about. Focus on the good parts of your personality \u2014often ADD/ADHD accompanies incredible creativity, passion, energy and out -of- the box thinking. Set up your environment to support these strengths! But for those who find that the symptoms of ADD/ADHD are still getting in the way of their lives, it may be time to seek outside support such as individual therapy, medication , behavioral coaching or vocational counseling. It is important to kno w that no matter how out of control or frazzled a person feels, there is hope.
