The Plan provides coverage for participating Employees, Retirees, and eligible Dependents. Th e Employee Benefits Division of the State of Arkansas Department of Transfo rmation and Shared Services (TSS EBD) reserves the right to interpret the elements of this Plan Document as necessary for the continued administration of the Plan . No or al interpretations can change this Plan.

T o the extent that an item or service is a covered benefit under the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall be applied in a manner that does not discriminate against a health care Provider who is acting within the scope of the Provider's license or other required credentials under applicable State law. This provision does not preclude the Plan from setting limits on benefits, including cost sharing provisions, fre quency limits , or restrictions on the methods or settings in which treatments are provid ed and does not require the Plan to accept all types of Providers as a Network Provider. F ailure to follow the eligibility or enrollment requirements of this Plan may re sult in delay of coverage or no coverage at all. Reimbursement from the Plan can be reduced or denied because of certain provisions in the Plan, such as coordination of benefits, su brogation, exclusions, timeliness of COBRA elections, utilization review or other cost management requirements, lack of Medical Necessity, lack of timely filing of claims , or lack of coverage. These provisions are explained in summary fashion in this docum ent; additional information is available from the Plan Administrator at no extra cost. T he Plan will pay benefits only for the expenses incurred while this coverage is in force. No ben efits are payable for expenses incurred before coverage began or after coverage terminated.

N o action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover under any section of this Plan until the appeal rights provided have been exercised and the Plan benefits requested in such appeals have been denied in whole or in part. C hanges in the Plan ma y occur in any or all parts of the Plan including benefit coverage, Deductibles, maximums, Copayments, exclusions, limitations, definitions, eligibility , and the like. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 2 D EFINED TERMS T he following terms have special meanings and when used in t his Plan will be capitalized. A ccidental Injury is defined as bodily injury (other than intentionally self-inflicted injury) sustained by a Member while the coverage is in force, and which is the direct cause of the loss, independent of dis ease or bodily infirmity. Injury to a tooth or teeth while eating is not considered an Accidental Injury. A ctive Employee is an Employee who is on the regular payroll of the Employer and who has begun to perform the duties of his or her job with the Employer on a full -time basis. A dvanced Diagnostic Imaging means Computed tomography scanning SCAN\"), emission tomography scans (\"PET SCAN\"). A llowance or Allowable Cha rge, when used in connection with Covered Services or supplies delivered in Arkansas, will be the amount deemed by the Claims Administrator, to be reasonable. The customary allowanc e is the basic Allowance or Allowable Charge. However, the Allowance or Allowable Charge may vary, given the facts of the case and the opinion of Claims Administrator's medical director. A llowances or Allowable Charges for services or supplie s received ou t of Arkansas may be determined by the local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Pla n. Please note that all benefits under this Plan are subject to and shall be paid only by reference to the Allowance or Allowable Charge as determined at the discretion of the Claim s Administrator. This means that regardless of how much a health care Provi der may bill for a given service, the benefits under this Plan will be limited by the established Allowance or Allowable Charge. Participating Providers are obligated t o accept the Claims Administrator's established rate as payment in full, and should only bill the Covered Person for Deductible, Coinsurance, and any non- Covered Services; however, if a Covered Person uses a non -participating Provider, they will be respons ible for all am ounts billed in excess of the Allowance or Allowable Charge. T he payment to a Provider for their services as described in a Current Procedural Terminology (\"CPT\") or Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (\"HCPCS\") code and reimbursed in accordance w ith the Resource -Based Relative Value System (\"RBRVS\") used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") is an all -inclusive, global payment that covers all elements of the service as described in the particular code billed. This me ans that whatev er staffing, overhead costs, equipment, drugs, machinery, tools, technology, supplies, or materials of any kind that may be required in order for the billing Provider to perform the service or treatment described in the CPT or HCPCS code bil led, the Claims Administrator's payment to the billing Provider of the Allowance or Allo wable Charge for that CPT or HCPCS code constitutes the entire payment and the limit of benefits under this Plan with respect to the CPT or HCPCS code billed. A Provider who bills f or a particular CPT or HCPCS code is deemed to represent that the billing Provider has performed and is responsible for provision of all services or treatments described in the CPT or HCPCS code, and is entitled to bill for such services or tr eatments. If the Claims Administrator pays for a Covered Service by applying the Allowance or Allowable Charge to the bill of a Provider who represents that the Provider has performed a service or treatment described in a CPT or HCPCS code as submitted, the Claims Administrator shall have no further obligation, nor is there coverage under thi s Plan, for bills from or payment to any other Provider, entity or person, regardless of whether they assisted the billing Provider or furnished any staffing, equipment, drugs, machin ery, tools, technology, supplies, or materials of any kind to or for the benefit of the billing Provider. In other words, benefits under this Plan are limited to one, global payment for all components of any services falling within the scope of any CPT or HCPCS code service or treatment description, and the Claims Administrator will make only one payment with respect to such CPT or HCPCS code, even if multiple parties claim to have contributed a portion of the staffing, equipment, ARBenefits January 1, 2021 3 m achinery, tools, technolo gy, supplies, or materials used by the billing Provider in the course of providing the service or treatment described in the CPT or HCPCS code. F or example, a Physician who performs certain surgical procedures in the Physician's office might choose to engage an equipment and supply company to set up the surgical table, furnish an assisting nurse, and also furnish certain surgical instruments, devices, or supplies used by the Physician. When the Physician bills the Plan for the Physician's pe rformance of th e surgical procedure described in a specific CPT or HCPCS code, the Claims Administrator will make a single, global payment to the Physician for Covered Services described in the CPT or HCPCS code, and will not be obligated to pay for any charges of the eq uipment and supply company. In such circumstances, any charge or claim of payment due the equipment and supply company shall be the exclusive responsibility of the Physician (or other Provider) who engaged the equipment and supply company and permitted or facilitated such company's access to the Physician's patient. In any event, as noted above, no benefits are available under this Plan for any services, drugs, materials, or supplies of the equipment and supply company. It is the Claims Admin istrator's p olicy (and this Plan is specifically intended to adopt the same) that no benefits shall be paid for \"unbundled services\" in excess of the Allowance or Allowable Charge for any service as described in the applicable CPT or HCPCS code . This means , for example, that if a Physician and another category of Provider (such as a Durable Medical Equipment supplier, a Laboratory, a nurse practitioner, a nurse, a physician assistant, or any other category of Provider) agree together to divide up, split or \"unbundle\" the components of any CPT or HCPCS code, and attempt to bill separately for the various components each allegedly provides for the patient, benefits under this Plan shall nevertheless be limited to one Allowance per CPT or HCPCS code; in such ci rcumstances, benefits under this Plan will pay only one Allowance or Allowable Charge for any Covered Service described in any single CPT or HCPCS code, and the various Providers involved in any such \"unbundling\" action or agreement must resolv e among themselves any div ision of that single Allowance or Allowable Charge between or among them. Members can protect themselves from the possibility of billing in excess of the Allowance or Allowable Charge in these circumstances by always inquiring in advance to be sure that each Provider involved in their care or treatment is an In- Network Provider . P lease note that the Claims Administrator makes the following exceptions to the preceding general policy of one global payment (Allowance) per CPT or HCPC S code: (i) where CMS has developed and published an RBRVS policy that specifically recognizes that the Relative Value Units (RVUs) associated with a specific CPT or HCPCS code should be divided into both a professional and a technical component; or billing of the services of an as sistant surgeon for those CPT or HCPCS codes that specifically recognize assistant surgery services as applicable; or (iii) billing of radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine procedures where such radiopharmaceuticals clearl y are not included in the practice expense portion of the associated RVU as published and defined by CMS; or (iv) billing of a procedure or set of procedures that, per the applicable CPT or HCPCS code definition, is based solely on time consumed so that it is necessar y to submit multiple units of the procedure in order to accurately report the total time devoted to the patient. In the specific four circumstances outlined in the preceding sentence, the Claims Administrator will recognize and pay more than one Allowance per CPT or H CPCS code, provided all other terms and conditions of this Plan are met. Wi th respect to the first such circumstance involving RVUs divided between a professional and a technical component, payment will be limited to one global paym ent (Allowan ce) for the ap plicable professional component, and one global payment (Allowance) for the technical component. In other words, even where CMS policy specifically recognizes division of an RVU into professional and technical components, the Claims Administrator will not be responsible for paying multiple Providers or multiple billings for the professional component, nor will the Claims Administrator be responsible for paying multiple Providers or multiple billings for the technical component. Ben efits under this Plan will be limited in such circumstances to one global payment (Allowance) for the professional component and one global payment (Allowance) for the technical component. A mbulance Service means ground or air transportation in a regularly equipped a mbulance lic ensed by an appropriate agency and where the use of any other means of transportation is not medically indicated.

ARBenefits January 1, 2021 14 HOW COVERAGE UNDER THE PLAN WORKS The Employer has established and maintains this Plan for Employees, Retirees, and th eir eligible Dependents. The health benefit Plan provides a range of covera ge for medical services. This is a very valuable benefit, but Members should understand that the Pl an does NOT cover all medical services, drugs, supplies, tests, or equipment (\"Hea lth Interventions\" or \"Interventions\"). A Plan covering all Health Interventions would be prohibi tively expensive. For that reason, this Plan is more limited. This document i s a guide to what is and is not eligible for benefits under the Plan. Accordingly, Members should read this entire document carefully both now and BEFORE obt aining medical or prev entive health services to be sure they understand what is covered and the lim itations on coverage. The Employer wants Members to have coverage for the vast ma jority of medical needs they may face, including most Hospital and Physicia n Services, Emergency Ca re, preventive and wellness services, medications, supplies, and equipment. However, in order to keep costs of the Plan within reasonable limits, the Plan ha s deliberately excluded coverage of a number of specific Health Interventions, placed coverage limits on some other Interventions, and established an overall standard called t he \"Primary Coverage Criteria\" that each and every claim for benefits must meet i n order to be covered under the Plan. For any Health Intervention, there a re several general cov erage criteria that must be met in order for that Intervention to qualify for coverage under the Plan. (1) The Primary Coverage Criteria must be met; (2) At the time of the Intervention, the Member must meet the Plan's eligibility standards ; (3) The Health Interven tion must conform to specific limitations stated in the Plan; (4) The Health Int ervention must not be specifically excluded under the terms of the Plan; (5) Members must comply with the Plan's Provider network and cost sharing arrangements; and, (6) The Plan's proc edures for filing claims must be followed. Following is a brief description of each of these qualifications. The Primary Coverage Criteria . The Primary Cover age Criteria apply to ALL benefits a Member may claim under the Plan. It do es not matter what typ es of Health Intervention may be involved or when or where the Intervention i s obtained. The Primary Coverage Criteria are designed to allow Plan benefits for only those Health Interventions that are proven as safe and effective treat ment. The Primary Cove rage Criteria also provide benefits only for the least invasive or risky Inte rvention when such Intervention would safely and effectively treat the medical con dition; or they provide benefits for treatment in an outpatient, doctor's office or home care set ting when such treatment would be a safe and effective alternative to hospital ization. Examples of the types of Health Interventions that the Primary Coverage Criteria exclude from coverage include such things as the cost of hospitali zation for a minor col d or some other condition that could be treated outside the Hospital, or the c ost of an investigational drug or treatment such as herbal therapy, or some forms of Chemotherapy not shown to have any beneficial or curative effect on a particular cancerous condition. Finally, the Primary Coverage Criteria require that if there are two or more effective alternative Health Interventions, the Plan should limit its pay ment to the Allowance or Allowable Charge for the most cost effective Inter vention. The specific co verage standards that must be met under the Primary Coverage Criteria are o utlined in the Primary Coverage Criteria Section found later in this document. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 15 Eligibility Standards. Members must be eligible for benefits under the Plan a t the time they receiv e a Health Intervention. Eligibility standards are set forth in the Eligibilit y, Funding, Effective Date , and Termination Section of this document. In order to be an eligible Member of the Plan, Members must meet the Plan's eligibility standards, which oft en include limited enrollment periods. It is important for Members to underst and the provisions that outline the circumstances under which coverage may termina te under the Plan. Special situations provided by state and federal law t hat allow continued cove rage under the Plan for a limited time after an individual is no longer an E mployee, Retiree, or Dependent, are described later in the document in the Sectio n entitled Continuation Coverage Rights Under COBRA. Specific Limitations. Because of the high c ost of some Health Interventions, as well as the difficulty in some cases of determining whether an Intervention is really needed, the Plan includes coverage f or such Health Interventions but place limits on the extent of coverage by limiting the number of Provider visits or treatments received during a Calendar Year or other speci fied time period. Examples of such limitations include a limit on the number of covered visits for chiropractic services. Other types of limitations include requirements that an I ntervention be provided in a particular location or by a Provider holding a pa rticular type of license, or in accordance with a written treatment plan or other documentation. Common benefits and limitations are outlined in detail in the Schedules of Benefi ts and the Medical Benefits Sections of this document. Members will note that this document refers to Coverage Policies the Claims Administrator has developed that may address limitations of coverage for a particular service, treatmen t, or drug. Members ma y request a copy of Coverage Policy with respect to a particular service, tre atment, or drug, or may review established Coverage Policies on the Claims Adminis trator's website at www.healthadvantage -hmo.com . Specific Exclusion s. There are many possible reasons why the Plan has selected a particular condition, health care Provider, Health Intervention, or service to be excluded from the Plan. Some exclusions a re based on the availability of other coverage or financing for certai n typ es of injuries. For example, injuries received on the job are generally covered by workers' compensation. Other exclusions are based on the need to try to ke ep coverage affordable, covering basic health care service needs, but not covering every possi ble d esired Intervention. The exclusion for Cosmetic Services is an example of this type of exclusion. The Plan excludes coverage of some health care Providers be cause the Provider is not qualif ied or because the Provider lacks appropriate training or expe rienc e to provide a service, or the service lies outside his or her scope of practice. For example, the Plan does not cover services rendered by unlicensed Providers or by Hospital resid ents, interns, students, or fellows. Other exclusions are based on the Pla n's judgment that the need for such Health Intervention is questionable in many cases, or that the services are of unknown or unproven beneficial effect. Exa mples of these types of exclusio ns include biofeedback and cranial electrotherapy stimulation devic es, as well as some forms of high dose Chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. Before undergoing treatment or tests, Members should review the specific exclusions listed in th e Plan E xclusions Section of this document. If they have any questions abou t whether a specific exclusion applies, they should discuss it with their doctor(s). Assistance is also available from the Claims Administrator or EBD. Membe rs may request a copy of Coverage Policy with respect to a particular service, treatment, or d rug, or may review established Coverage Policies on the Claims Administrator's website at www.healthadva ntage -hmo.com . Provider Network and Cost Sharing Proced ures. The Plan does not provide coverage for 100% of the costs associated with covered Health Interventions. Members are expected to pay Copayments, Deductible, and Coinsurance. Mem bers are encourage d to select, and to maintain a patient -physician relation ship with, their Primary Care Physician. Coverage includes a special limitation in the form of provider network requirements. These provisions are designed t o try t o hold down the c osts of coverage b y limiting the coverage to those Physicians, Hospitals, or other health care Providers who participate in the Plan's provider networks, and by having the Primary Care Physician consult with the Member in advance on whethe r the ARBenefits January 1, 2021 16 s ometimes mor e expensive services of a specialist are really needed, or whether the Pr imary Care Physician can adequately address the problem. Members and their Physician are always free to make any decision they believe is best for the Member concer ning whether to r eceive any particular service or treatment, or whether to see any Provider (in or out of the network). However, if a Member does decide to go \"out-of-network\" for services or treatment, coverage will be reduced or limited to the Out-of- Network rate. Member cost-sharing responsibilities are identified in the Schedule of Benefits S ection. P rior Approval. In some cases, the Member also may be required to meet certain prior approval of coverage procedures as outlined in this document. A complete list of servic es subject to prio r approval is provided in the Cost Management Section. Th ere are exceptions to the network for emergencies or, in rare cases upon approval by the Plan, where services or treatment covered under the Plan are not ava ilable for some reason from an In -Network Provider. In- Network Providers are identified in a published provider directory, or Members may call the Claims Administrator to ask about a specific Provider, or visit the claims administrator's website at www.h ealthadvantage-hmo.com . C laim Filing Procedures. The Plan provides procedures that the Covered Person, their Provider or Authorized Representative must fol low in filing claims. Failure to follow these procedures could result in significant delays in the processing of a claim, as well as potential denial of benefits. For example, not informing a Provider of the timely filing provision which causes the claim t o not meet timely filing requirements will make a Me mber fully responsible for charges for services from that Provider. These procedures are set out in the How to Submit a Claim Section. In addition, the Section explains how a Member can appeal a benefit d etermination in the event he or she believes that such benefit determination does not comply with the terms of the Plan. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 17 PRIMARY COVERAGE CRITERIA Purpose and Effect of Primary Coverage Criteria. The Primary Coverage Cri teria are designed to al low Plan benefits for only t hose Interventions that are proven as safe and e ffective treatment. Another goal of the Primary Coverage Criteria is to prov ide benefits only for the less invasive or least risky Intervention when such In tervention would safely and effectively treat the medical condition, or to provide benefits for treatment in an outpatient, doctor's office or home care setting when such treat ment would be a safe and effective alternative to hospitalization. Finally, if there is more than one ef fective Health Intervention available, the Primary Coverage Criteria allow t he Plan to limit its payment to the Allowance or Allowable Charge for the most cost -effective Intervention. Regardless of anything else in this Plan, and re gardless of any other communications or materials a Member may receive in connection with the Plan, the Member will not have coverage for any service, any medication, any treat ment, any procedure or any equipment, supplies, or associated costs UNLESS the P rimary Coverage Criteria set forth in this Section a re met. At the same time, bear in mind that jus t because the Primary Coverage Criteria are met does not necessarily mean the treatment or services will be covered under the Plan. For example, a Health Int ervention that meets the Primary Coverage Criteria w ill be excluded if the condition being treated i s a non- covered treatment excluded by the Plan. As explained in the precedin g Section, the Primary Coverage Criteria represent one category of six general coverage criteria that mu st be met for coverage in al l cases. The Primary Coverage Criteria are as f ollows: Elements of the Primary Coverage Criteria . In order to be covered, m edical services, drugs, treatments, procedures, tests, equipment, or supplies (\" Interventions\") must be re commended by the treating Physician and meet all of the following require ments: (1) The Intervention must be an item or service delivered or undertaken primarily to prevent, diagnose, detect, treat, palliate, or alleviate a medical condition or to maintain or restore functional ability of the mind or body. A \"medical condition\" me ans a disease, Illness, Accidental Injury, Pregnancy, or a biological or psyc hological condition that, if untreated, impairs or threatens to impair ability o f the body or mind to func tion in a normal, healthy manner. (2) The Intervention must be proven to be effective (as defined below) in preventing, treating, diagnosing, detecting, or palliating a medical condition. (3) The Intervention must be the most appropriat e supply or level of ser vice, considering potential benefits and harm to the patient. The following examples illustrate application of this standard (but are not intended to li mit the scope of the standard): (i) An Intervention is not appropriate, for purp oses of the Primary Cove rage Criteria, if it would e xpose the patient to more invasive procedures or greater risks when less invasive procedures or less risky Interventions wou ld be safe and effective to diagnose, detect, treat, or palliate a medical condi tion. (ii) An Intervention is not appropriate, under the Primary Coverage Criteria, if it involves hospitalization or other intensive treatment settings when the Intervention c ould be administered safely and effectively in an outpatient or other less intensive setting, such as the home. (4) The Primary Coverag e Criteria allow the Plan to limit its coverage to payment of the Allowance or Allowable Charge for the most cost -effective Intervention. \"Cost -effective\" means a Health Intervention where the benefits and harms relative to the costs represent an economic ally efficient use of resources for patients wi th the medical condition being treated through the Health Intervention. For e xample, if the benefits and risks to the patient of two alternative Intervention s are comparable, a Heal th Intervention costing $1,000 will be more cost- effective than a Health In tervention costing $10,000. \"Cost -effective\" shall not ARBenefits January 1, 2021 18 necessarily mean the l owest price. Primary Coverage Criteria Definitions. The following definitions a re used in describing the elements of the Primary Co verage Criteria: (1) Effective defined: (a) An existi ng Intervention (one that is commonly recognized as accepted or standard treatment or which has gained widespread, substantially unchallenged use and acceptance throughout the Unite d States) will be deemed \"ef fective\" for purposes of the Primary Coverage C riteria if the Intervention is found to achieve its intended purpose and to prevent, cure, alleviate, or enable diagnosis or detection of a medical condition without exposing the pa tient to risks that outweigh the potential benefits. This determination will be based on consideration of the following factors, in descending order of priority and weight: (i) Scientific evidence, as defined below (where available); (ii) If scientific evidence is not available, expert opi nion(s) (whether published or furnished by priva te letter or report) of an Independent Medical Reviewer(s) with education, t raining, and experience in the relevant medical field or subject area; or , (iii) If scientific evidence is no t available, and if expert o pinion is either unavailable for some reason or is substantially equally divided, professional standards, as defined and qua lified below, may be consulted. (iv) If neither scientific evidence, expert opinion nor professional standar ds show that an existing Int ervention will achieve its intended purpose to prevent, cure, alleviate, or enable diagnosis or detection of a medical condi tion, then the Plan in its discretion may find that such existing Intervention i s not effective and on that basis fails to meet the Primary Coverage Criteria. (b) A New Intervention (one that is not commonly recognized as accepted or standard treatment or which has not gained widespread, substantially unchallenged use and acceptance thro ughout the United States ) will be deemed \"effective\" for purposes of the Primary Coverage Criteria if there is scientific evidence (as defined below) showing that the Intervent ion will achieve its intended purpose and will cure, alleviate, or enable diagnosis or detection of a me dical condition without exposing the patient to risks that outweigh the pot ential benefits. Scientific evidence is deemed to exist to show that a new In tervention is not effective if the procedure is the subject of an ongoing phase I, II, or III trial or i s otherwise under study to determine its maximum tolerated dose, its toxicit y, its safety, its efficacy, or its efficacy as compared with a standard means of treatment or diagnosis. If there is a lack of scientific evidence regardin g a new Intervention, or if the available scientific evidence is in conflict or the subject of continuing debate, the new Intervention shall be deemed \"not effective,\" and ther efore not covered in accordance with the Primary Coverage Criteria, with one exc eption - if there is a n ew Intervention for which cl inical trials have not been conducted because t he disease at issue is rare or new or affects only a remote population, then the Intervention may be deemed \"effective\" if, but only if, it meets the definit ion of \"effective\" as defined for existing Intervent ions above. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 19 (2 ) Scientific Evidence defined. \"Sci entific Evidence,\" for purposes of the Primary Coverage Criteria, shall mean only one or more of the following listed sources of relevant clinical informatio n and evaluation: ( a) Resul ts of randomized controlled clinical trials, as published in the authoritati ve medical and scientific literature that directly demonstrate a statistically significant positive effec t of an Intervention on a medical condition. For purposes of this Subsectio n a., \" authoritative medical and scientific literature\" shall be such public ations as ar e r ecognized by the Plan, listed in the Claims Administrator's C overage Policy or otherwise listed as authoritative medical and scientific literature on the Claims Admini strator's website at www.healthadvantage-hmo.com ; or, ( b) Published reports of independent technology or pharmaceutical assessmentorganizations recognized as authoritative by the Plan. For purposes of this Subsection b. a n independent technology or pharmaceutical assessment organization shall b e c onsidered \"authoritative\" if it is recognized as such by the Plan, listed in the Claims Administrator's Coverage Po licy or otherwise listed as authoritative on the Claims Adminis trator's w ebsite at www.healthadvantage-hmo.com ndards defined. \"Professio nal standards,\" for purposes of applying the \"effectiveness\" standard of the Primary Coverage Criteria to an existing Intervention, shall mea n onl y the published clinical standards, published guidelines or published assessments of professional accreditat ion or certification organizations or of such ac credited nationa l p rofessio nal associations as are recognized by the Claims Administrator's Medical Director as speaking authoritatively on behalf of the licensed medical professionals participating in or repre sented by the associations. The Claims Administrator, acting on the Plan's behalf, shall have full discretion whether to accept or reject the statements of any professional association orprofessional accreditation or certificatio n organization as \"profe ssional standards\" for purposes of this Primary Coverage Criteria. No such s tatements shall be regarded as eligible to be classified as \"professional standards\" under the Primary Coverage Criteria unless suchstatements specifically address effectiveness of the Intervention, and conclude with substantia l s upporting evidence that the Intervention is safe, that its benefits outweigh potential risks to the patient, and that it is more likely than not to achieve its intended purpose and to prevent, cure , a lleviat e, or enable diagnosis or detection of a medic al condition. A pplication and Appeal of Primary Coverage Criteria. The following rules apply to any application of the Primary Coverage Criteria. The Claims Administrator, acting on the Plan's behalf, shall have full discretion in applying the Primary Coverage Criteria, and in interpreting any of its terms or phrases, or the manner in which it shall apply to a given Intervention. No Intervention shall be deemed to meet the Primary Cove rage Criteria unless the Intervention qualifies under ALL of the following rules: ( 1) Illegality. An Intervention does not meet the Primary Coverage Criteria if it is illegal toadminister or receive it under federal laws or regulations or the law or regulations of the state where adm inistered. (2 ) FDA Position. An Intervention does not meet the Primary Cover age Criteria if it involves any device or drug that requires approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), a nd F DA approval for marketing of the drug or device for a pa rticular medical condition has no t be en issued prior to the date of service. In addition, an Intervention does not meet the Primar y C overage Criteria if the FDA or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or a ny a gency or di vision thereof, through pu blished reports or statements, or through offi cialARBenefits January 1, 2021 20 a nnouncements or press releases issued by authorized spokespersons, have concluded that the Intervention or a means or method of administering it is unsafe, unethical, or contrary t o federal laws or regu lations. Neither FDA Pre -Market Approval nor FDA finding of substantial equivalency under 510(k) automatically guarantees coverage of a drug or device. ( 3) Proper License. An Intervention does not meet the Primary Coverage Criteria if th e health car e p rofessi onal or facility administering it does not hold the proper license, permit, accreditation, or other regulatory approval required under applicable laws or regulations in order to administer the Intervention. ( 4) Plan Exclusions, Limitat ions, or Eligibility Sta ndards . Even if an Intervention otherwise meets the Primary Coverage Criter ia, it is not covered under this Plan if the Intervention is subject to a Plan exclusion or limitation, or if the Member fails to meet Plan eligibilityrequi rements. ( 5) Position State ments of Professional Organizations. Regardless of whether an Interventi on meet s some of the other requirements of the Primary Coverage Criteria, the Intervention shall not be covered under the Plan if any national professional assoc iation, any accreditin g or c ertification organization, any widely -used medical compendium, or published guidelines of a ny na tional or international workgroup of scientific or medical experts have classified suc h I ntervention or its means or method of adm inistration as \"experime ntal\" or \"investigational\" or as questionable or of unknown benefit. However , an Intervention that fails to meet other requirements of the Primary Coverage Criteria shall not be covered under the Plan, even if a ny of the foregoing org anizations or groups c lassify the Intervention as not \"experimental\" or not \"investigational,\" or conclude that it is beneficial or no longer subject to question. For purposes of this Subsection 5, \"national professional association\" or \"accrediting or workgroup of scie ntific or medical experts\" s hall be such organizations or groups recognized by the Plan, listed in the Claims Administrator'sCoverage Policy or otherwise listed as authoritative on the Claims Administrator's website a t w ww.healthadvantage-hmo.com . ( 6) Cove rage Policy . With respect to certain drugs, treatments, services, tests, equipment, o r s upplies, the Claims A dministrator has developed specific Coverage Policies, which have been put into writing, and are published on the Claims Administrator's website at www.health advantage-hmo.com . If the Claims Administrator has develo ped a specific C overag e Policy that applies to the drug, treatment, service, test, equipment, or supply that a Member received or seeks to have covered under the Plan, the Coverage Policy shall be deemed to be determinative in evaluating whether such drug, treatment, ser vice, test, equipment, or suppl y m eets the Primary Coverage Criteria; however, the absence of a specific Coverage Policy with respect to any particular drug , treatment, service, te st, equipment, or supply shall not be construed to mean that such dr ug, treatment, service, test, equipment, or supply meets the Primary Coverage Criteria. M embers may appeal a determination that an Intervention does not meet the Primary Coverage Criter ia to the Appeals Coordinator. Use the procedures for appeal s outlin ed in the How to Submit a Claim Section. A ny appeal available with respect to a Primary Coverage Criteria determination shall be subject to the terms, conditions and definitions set forth i n the Primary Coverage Criteria. An appeal shall also be s ubject to the terms, conditions and definitions set forth elsewhere in this Plan. The Appeals Coordinator or an External Review organization shall render its independent evaluation so as to comply with and achieve the intended purpose of the Primary Covera ge Crite ria and other provisions of this Plan.

Retire es and COBRA participant s have a period of 30 days from the Qualifying Event to enro ll. T he Qualifying Event rules are described in more detail below. To request enrollment or obtai n more detailed informatio n of these portability provisions, contact the Employee Be nefits Division . Q UALIFYING EVENTS T he event s described below may create a right to enroll in the Plan under a Qualif ying Event. (1 ) Losing other coverage may create a Qualifying Even t. An Employee or Dependent who is eligible, but not enrolled in this P lan, may enroll if the individual loses eligibility for other coverage and loss of eligibility for coverage meets all of the following conditions: (a ) The Employee or Dependent was covered under a group health plan or had healt h i nsurance coverage at the time coverage under this Plan was previously offered to the individua l. (b) Th e Emp loyee stated in writing at the time that coverage was offered that the other health coverage was the reason for declining enrollment. (c) E ither (i) the oth er cover age was COBRA cove rage and the COBRA coverage was exhausted, or (ii) the other coverage was not COBRA coverage, and the coverage was terminated as a result of loss of eligibility for the coverage or because employer contributions towards the covera ge were termina ted.

A Qualifying Event for newly eligible Dependents begins after the date of the marriag e, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. To be eligibl e for a Qualify ing Event, the Dependent and/or Employee must request enrollment within 60 days of the event (or within 30 days of the event for Retiree and COBRA participan ts).

All ben efits described in this Schedule are subject to the Primary Coverage Cr iteria, the Allowable Char ge, and the benefit limits and exclusions described m ore fully herein. High Deductible Health P lan A qualified High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) with a Health Savings Account provides compre hensive coverage for high cost medical even ts and a tax -advantaged way to help build savings for future medical expenses. The Plan gives a Covered Person greate r control over how health care benefits are used. A HDHP satisfies certain statutory requirement s with respect to minimum Deductibles and o ut-of-pocket expenses for both single and family coverages. These minimum Dedu ctibles and limits for out- of-pocket ex penses' limit are set forth by the U.S. Department of Treasury and will be indexed for inflation in the future. This Plan has entered into an agreement with certain Hospitals, Physicians, and other health care Pr oviders, which are called In -Network Provid ers. Because these In -Network Providers have agreed to charge r educed fees to persons covered under the Plan, the Plan can afford to r eimbu rse a higher percenta ge of their fees. Therefore, when a Covered Person u ses an In -Network Provider, that Covered Person will receive a higher payment from the Plan than when an O ut-of-Network Provider is used. It is the Covered Person's choice as to whic h Provider to use. A listing of In -Network Providers is available on the Clai ms Administrator's website at www.h ealthadvantage- hmo.com . NOTE : The PS E Bas ic Plan does not prov ide coverage for Out -of-Network services with the excepti on of emergency care.

ARBenefits January 1, 2021 60 MEDICAL BENEF ITS Medical Benefits app ly whe n Covered Charges are incurred b y a Covered Person for c are of a n Accidental Injury or Sic kness and while the person is covered for these benefits unde r the Plan. DEDUCTIBLE Deductible means the amo unt of out of pocket expense a Member must incur for Covered Services each Calendar Year before any expens es are paid by the Plan. This amount is calculated fro m Allo wance or Allowable Charges, not the billed charges. Once the Ded uctible has been met, subj ect to all other terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions in the Plan, payment for Covered Services begins. The Deductible is waived for some services, su ch as Pre ventive Care, as identified in the Schedule of Benefi ts. Only In -Network Deducti bles will accrue toward the Annual Out -of-Pocket Limit. PLAN COINSURANCE Each Calendar Year, be nefits will be paid for the Covered Charges of a Covered Pers on that a re in excess of the Deductible and any Copayments . Payment will be mad e at the rate shown under reimbursement rate in the Schedule of Benefits. No benefits will be paid in excess of any listed limit of the Plan. OUT -OF-POCKET LIMIT Covered Charges are payable at the p ercentages shown each Calendar Year until the ou t-of-pocket limit shown in the Schedule of Be nefits is reached. Then, Covered Charges incurred by a Cover ed Person will be payable at 100% (except for any charge s exclud ed as shown in the Schedul e of Benefits) for the rest of the Calendar Year . When a Family Unit reaches th e out-of-pocket limit, Covered C harges for that Family U nit will be payable at 100% (except for any charges excluded, as shown on the Schedule of Benef its) for the re st of the Calendar Year. PLAN ALLOWANCE The P lan has defined an outer limit on Plan benefits that applies whether a Covered Person chooses t o receive servi ces from an In -Network Provide r or an Out -of-Network Provider. This overall limit on the a mount of Plan benefits available under the Plan is defined in th is Plan Document description as the \"Allowable Charge\" or \"Allowance,\" and may also be referred to fro m time to time as the \"Plan Allowance\" under the Plan. Benefits under the Plan will always be limited by the Plan Allowanc e that the Plan has adop ted, as further defined in this se ction. This means that regardless of how much a health care P rovider may bil l for any service, drug, medic al device, equipment , or supplies, the benefits under the Plan will be limited to the Plan A llowance, as established in the Defined Terms section. Patient's Share of the Plan Allowance and Billed Charges of the Provider The P lan calculates and pays Plan b enefits on the basis of the Plan Allowance, an amount that may vary substantially from the a mount a Provider chooses to bill. Once the Plan Allowance is determined with respect to any Provider's billed charges, the Covered Per son may be responsible for a percentage or portion of the Plan Allowance, depending on the terms of the Plan with respect to Copayments, Coinsurance, and Deductible. For example, i f services are provided by an In -Network Provider, the Plan m ay pay 80% of t he Plan Allowance, in which ca se the Covered Person would be responsible for the rem aining 20% of the Plan Allowance, but not for the difference b etween t he Plan Allowance and the Provider's billed charges. In this situation, the In- Network Provider contra ct protects the Covered Person from additional billing beyond the Plan Allowance. For an O ut- ARBenefits January 1, 2021 61 of-Network Provider, the circ umstances are substantially diff erent. For example, if ser vices are provided by an Out-of-Network Provider, the Plan ma y pay only 50% of the Plan Allowance, in whic h case the Covered Person would be responsible for the remai ning 50% of the Plan Allowance. However, the Covered Per son migh t also be held responsible by the Out -of-Network Provider for paying the difference bet ween the Plan Allowance and the Provider's full, billed charges. COVERED CHARGES ARBenefits is a comp rehensive major medical health p lan, with Covered Servic es inclu ding preventive care, Phys ician Services, Hospital admissions , and Outpatient Care, pre scription drug coverage, behavioral/mental health services, rehabilitation, Emergency Care , and muc h more . It is important to remember th at not every medical ser vice is covered by the Plan. Certa in exclusions and limitations do exist and it is the members' responsibility to understand the Covered Ser vices under this Plan. Some services require prior a pprova l before the Plan will consider the expense as a Covered Service. This process is referred to as Utilization Management and can be a very effective plan management to ol. See the Cost Management Se ction for more information regarding Utilization Manag ement. Because of the high cost of some services or treatment s, as we ll as the difficulty in so me cases of determining whether services are really needed, t he Plan include s coverage for such services o r treatments but place limits on the extent of coverag e by l imiting the number of Provider visits or treatments rece ived dur ing a Calendar Year or oth er specified period of time. This section describes medical s ervices, drugs, supplies, tests, and equipment for which coverage is provided under the Plan, provi ded al l terms, conditions, exclusions, and limitations of the Plan, in cluding the six coverage c riteria, are satisfied.

Fol lowing is a description of how the Plan processes claims for benefits and reviews the appea l of any claim that is d enied . The terms use d in this section are defined below. A \" Claim\" is defined as any req uest for a Plan benefit, m ade by a claimant or by a representative of a claimant, which complies with the Plan's reasonable procedure for fili ng claims and makin g ben efit claims determin ations. A \" Claim\" does not in clude a request for a determination of an individual's eligibility to participate in the Plan. If a Claim is denied , in whole or in part, or if Plan coverage is rescinded retroact ively for fraud or misre prese ntation, the denial is known as an \"Adverse Be nefit Determination.\" A c laimant has the right to request a rev iew of an Adverse Benefit Determination. This reques t is an \"Appeal.\" If the Claim is denied at the end of the Appea l process, as described below , the Plan's final decision is known as a \"Fin al Ad verse Benefit Determination.\" If t he claimant receives notice of a Final Adverse Benefit Determination, or if th e Plan does not follow the Appeal procedures properly, the claimant then has the right to pursue legal action or, in certain categories of claims, may request an independent exte rnal review. The External Review procedures are described later in this sectio n. Bot h the Claims and the Appeal procedures are intended to provide a full and f air review . This means, a mong other things, that Claims and A ppeals will be decided in a manner designed to ensure the independence and impartiality of the persons involved in making these decisions. A c laimant must follow and complete all Claims and Appeal pr ocedu res both internal and external, before he or she can file a lawsuit. If a lawsuit is brought, it must be filed within two years after the final determination of an Appeal. Any of the authority and responsibilities of the Plan Administrator under the Claims and Appeal Procedures or the External Revie w Pro cess, including the discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the Plan, may be delegated to a third party. If the Covered Person has any questions regarding these procedures, they should conta ct the Plan Administrator. Th ere are different ki nds of Claims and each one has a specific timetable for each step in the review process. Upon receipt of the Claim, the Claims Administrator must decide whether to approve or deny t he Claim. The Claims Adm inistrator's notific ation to the claimant of its decisio n must be made as shown in the tim etable. However, if the Cl aim has not been filed properly, or if it is incompl ete, or if there are other matters beyond the control of the Claims Administrator, the claima nt may be notified that the period for providing the notification will need to be extended. If the period is extended because the Claims Administrator needs more information from the claimant, the claimant must provide the requ ested information w ithin the time shown on the timetable. Once the Claim is complete, the Claims Administrator must make its decision as sho wn in the timetable. If the Claim is denied, in whole or in part, the claimant has the right to file an Appeal. Then the Claims Administrator mus t decide the Ap peal and, if the Appeal is denied, provide notice to the claimant within the time periods shown on the timetable. The time periods shown in the timetable begin at the time the Claim or Appeal is filed in accordance with the Plan's procedures . Decisions will be made within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances, but within the maximum time periods listed in the timetables. Unless otherwise noted, \"days\" means calendar days. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 98 The de finitions of the types of Cla ims are: Urge nt Care Cl aim A Cl aim involving Urgent Care is any Claim for medical care or treatment where the Plan conditions receipt of benefits, in whole or in part, on approval in advance of obtaining the care or treatment, and us ing the timetable for a non-urgent care determination could seriously jeopa rdize the life or health of the claimant; or the ability of the c laimant to regain maximum function; or in the opinio n of the attending or consulting Physician, would subject the claimant to severe pain th at co uld not be adeq uately managed without the care or t reatment that is the subject of th e Claim. A P hysician with knowledge of the claimant's medical condition may determine if a Claim is one involving Urgent Care. If there is n o such Physician, an individu al acting on behalf of the Plan applying the judgment of a prudent layperson who poss esses an average knowledge of health and medicine may make the determination.

A lternative ly, the claiman t may request an expedited revi ew under the External Review Process. Con current Care Claims A C oncurrent Care Claim is a special type of Claim that arises if the Plan informs a claimant that benefits for a course of treatment that has b een previously approved for a period of time or num ber of treatments is to be reduced or eliminated.

This rule does not apply if benefits are reduced or eliminat ed due to Plan amendment or termination. A similar process applies for Claims based on a rescission of coverage for fraud or misrepresentation .

ARBenefits January 1, 2021 101 BLUE CARD \u00ae PROGRAM Out-of -Arkansas Services. The Health Plan participates in a variety of relatio nships with other Blue Cro ss and/or Blue Shield Licensees referred to generally as \"Inter- Plan Programs.\" Whenever a Covered Person obtains health care services outside of the State of Arkansas (\"the s ervice area\"), the claim s for these services may be pro cesse d through one of thes e Inter -Plan Programs, which include the BlueCard Program and may include negotiated National Account arrangements available between the Health Plan and other Blue Cross and Blue Shield Licensees. Typ ically, when accessing care outs ide the service area, a Covered Person will obtain care from health care Providers that have a contractual agree ment (i.e., are \"participating Providers\") with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shi eld Licen see in that oth er geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). In some instances, a Co vered Person may obtain care from nonpa rticipating health care Providers. The Health Plan's practices for consideration of payment in both instances are described below. (1) B lueCard\u00ae Program. (a) Under the BlueCard\u00ae Program, when a Covered Person accesses covered health care services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, the Hea lth Plan will remain responsible for fulfilling its contractual obligations. However , the Hos t Blue is respo nsible for contracting with and gene rally handling all interactions with its participating health care Providers. Whenever a Covered Person accesses covered health care services outside the service area and the claim is processed th rough the BlueCard Program, the amount a Covered Person pays for covered health c are services is calculated based on the lower of: (i) The billed Covered Charges for the Cover ed Services; or (ii) The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to the H ealth Plan. (b) O ften, this \"negotiated price\" wil l be a simple discount tha t reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to the health care Provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with the health ca re Pr ovider or Provider group that may include type s of settlements, incentiv e payments, and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average price, base d on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of health car e Pro viders after ta king into account the same type s of transactions as with an estimated price. (c) E stimated pric ing and average pricing, going forward, also take into account adjustments to correct for over- or underestimation of modifications of past pricing for the type s of transaction modifications noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the price used for a Covered Person's claim because the adjust ments will not be applied retroactively to claims already paid. (d) L aws in a small num ber o f states may re quire the Host Blue to add a surchar ge to the calculation . If any stat e laws mandate other liabi lity calculation methods, including a surcharge, the Health Plan would then calculate the Covered Person's liability for any covered health care services accord ing to applicable law.ARBenefits January 1, 2021 102 (2) N on-Participating Health Ca re Providers Outside the Service Area (a ) When covered healthcare services are provided outside of the service area by non - participating health care Providers, the amount a Cove red P erson pays for such services will generally be b ased on either the Host Blue's nonpar ticipating health care Pro vider local payment or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state law. In these situations, a Covered Person may be liable for the dif ference between the amount that the non-participating health care Provider bills and any payment made for the covered services as set forth in this paragraph. (b) I n certain situations, the Health Plan may use other payment bases, such as billed Covered Charges, the pa yment the Health Plan would make if the health care services had been obtained within the servic e area, or a special negotiated payment, as permitted under Inter- Plan Programs Policies, to determine the amount the Health Plan will p ay for services rendered by nonparticipating health care Providers. In these situ ations, a Covered Person may be liable for the difference between the amount that the non- participating health care Provider bills and the payment the Health Plan will make fo r the Covered Services as set forth in this paragraph. BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD GL OBAL CORE If t he Covered Person is out side the United States (hereinafter \"BlueCard service area\"), they may be able to take advantage of Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core when acces sing Covered Se rvices.

For instance, alth ough Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core assists individuals with accessing a network of inpat ient, outpatien t, and professional Providers, the n etwork is not served by a Host Blue. As such, when a Covered Person receives care from Providers outside the Blu eCard service area, they will typically have to pay the Provider directly. If a Cove red Perso n needs medical assistance services (including locating a doctor or Hosp ital) outside the BlueCard service area, they may contact customer service at the number on the back of their health plan identification card or additional information can be found at www.bcbsglobalcore.com . (1 ) Inpatient Services. In most cases, i f the Covered Person contacts Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core for assistance, Ho spitals will not require a Covered Person to pay for cover ed inpatient services, except for applicable cost -share amounts (Deductibles, coinsurance, etc.). In such cases, th e Hospital will submit claims to the service center to begin claims processing. How ever, if the Covered Pers on paid in full at the time of se rvice, they must submit a claim to receive a benefit determinat ion. Contact the Claims Administrator to obtain Prio r Approval for non- emergency inpatient services. (2 ) Outpatient Services. Physicia ns, urgent care centers , and other outpatient Providers lo cated outside the BlueCard service ar ea will typically require the Covered Person to pay in full at the time of service.

When the Cove red Person pays for services outside the BlueCard service area, a claim must be submitted to receive a benefit determination. For institutional and professional claims, a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core claim form should be completed and sent with the P rovider's itemized bill(s) to the service center (the address i s on the form) to initiate claims processing.

Coordination of be nefits sets out rules for the order of payment of Covere d Charges when two or more plans -- including Medicare -- are paying. When a Covered Person is covered by this Plan and another plan , or the Covered Person's Spouse is covered by this Plan and by ano ther plan or the coup le's Covered Children are covered under two or more plans , the plans will coordinat e benefits when a claim is received. The p lan that pays first acco rding to the rules will pa y as if there were no other plan involved. The secondary and subsequent plans will pay the balance due up to 100% of the total Allowable Charges. Ben efit pl an. This provision w ill coordinate the medical benefits of a benefit plan. Th e term benefit plan means this Plan or any one of the following plans: (1) Gr oup or group-type plans, including franchise or blanket benefit plans. (2) Blu e Cross and Blue Shield group plans. (3) Gr oup practice and other group prepayment plans. (4) Fe deral government plans or programs. This includes, but is not limited to, Medicar e and Tricare.

(6) No Fault Auto In surance, by whatever name it is called, when not prohibited by law. Eligib le Charge. For a charge to be eligible i t must b e an Allowable Charge and at least part of it must be covered under this Plan. In t he case of HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) or other in -network only plans: T his P lan will not consider any charges in excess of what an HMO or network provide r has ag reed to accept as payment in full. In t he case of service type plans where services are provided as benefits, the reasonable cash value of each service will be the Allow able Charge. Aut omobile limitations. When medical payments are available under vehicle insurance, the Plan shall always be considered the secondary carrier regardless of the ind ividual's election u nder PIP (personal injury protection) coverage with the auto c arrier. Bene fit plan payment order. When two or more plans provide benefits for the same Allowable C harge , benefit payme nt will follow these rules: (1) Pl ans that do not have a coordination provision, or one like it, will pay first. Plans with such a provision will be considered after those without one. (2) Pl ans with a coordination provision will pay their benefits up to the Allowable Charge: (a) The benefits of the plan which covers the person directly (that is, as an employee, member or subscriber) (\"Plan A\") are determined before those of the plan which covers the person as a Dependent (\"Pl an B\" ).ARBenefits January 1, 2021 111 (b) The benefits of a benefit plan which covers a person as an Employee who is neither laid off nor retired are determined before those of a benefit plan which cov ers that person as a laid-off or Retired Employee. The benefits of a benefit plan which co vers a person as a Dependent of an Employee who is neither laid off nor retire d are determined before those of a benefit plan which covers a person as a Dependent of a laid off or Retire d Empl oyee. If the other benefit pla n does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule does not apply. (c) The bene fits o f a benefit plan which cover s a person as an Employee who is nei ther laid off nor retired or a Dependent of an Employee who is neither l aid off nor retired are determined before those of a plan which covers the person as a COBRA benefici ary. (d) When a Child is covered as a Dependent and the parents are not separated or divorced, these rules will apply: (i) The benefits of the benefit plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in a year are determined befo re those of the benefit plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year; and, (ii) If both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the benefit plan whic h has covered the parent for the longer time are determined before those of the benefit plan which covers th e othe r parent. (e) Whe n a Child's parents are divorced or legally separated, these rules will apply: (i) Th is rul e applies when the parent wi th custo dy of the Child has not re married. The benefit plan of the parent with custody will be considered before the benefit plan of the parent without custody. (ii) T his rule app lies when the parent with custody of the Child has remarried. The benefit plan of the parent with custody will be considered first. The benefit plan of the stepparent that covers the Chi ld as a Dependent will be consider ed next. The benefit plan of the par ent without custody will b e considered last. (iii) T his rule will be in place of items (i) and (ii) a bove when it applies. A court decree may state which parent is financi ally responsible for medical and dental benefits of the Child. In this case, the benefit plan of that parent will be considered before other plans that cover the Chil d as a Dependent. (iv) If t he specific terms of the court decree state that the par ents shall share joint custody, without stating that one of the parents is responsible f or the health care expenses of the Child, the plans cove ring the Child shall follo w the or der of benefit determination rules outlined above when a Child is covered as aDependent and the parents are not separated or divorced. (v) F or parents who were ne ver marr ied to each other, the rul es apply as set out above as long as paternity has been established. (f) If there is still a conflict after the se rules have been applied , the be nefit plan which has cover ed the patient for the longer time will be considered first. This includes situations in which a person who is covered as a Dependent Child under one benefit pl an is also covered as a Dependent Spouse under another benefit plan. W hen there is a conflict inARBenefits January 1, 2021 112 coordi nation of benefit rules, the Plan will never pay more than 50% of Allowable Charges when paying secondary. (3) Med icare will pay p rimary, secondary , or last to the extent stated in federal law. When Medicare would be the primary payer if the person had enrolled in Medicare, this Plan will base its payme nt upon benefits that woul d have been paid by Medicare u nder Parts A and B regardless of w hether or not the person was enrolled under any of these parts. ARBenefits is an entirely different benefit plan than that which is available through Medicare and is subje ct to different cover ages and exclusions, as defined by EBD. ARBenefits is not a Medicare Supplement plan. (4) If a Plan Participant is under a disability extension from a previous benef it pla n, that benefit plan will pa y first and this Plan will p ay secon d. (5) Th e Plan will pay primary to Tricare and a State child health plan to the exten t required by f ederal law. Cla ims det ermination period. Benefits will be coordinated on a Calendar Year basis. This is called the claims determination period. Rig ht to rece ive or release necessary informati on. To make this provision work, this Plan may give or obtain needed information from another insurer or any other organization or person. T his information may be given or obtained without the consent of or notice to any other per son. A Covered Person will give this Plan the information it asks for about other plans and their payment of Allowable Charges. Faci lity of payment.

The P lan shall not take into co nsiderat ion the fact that an individual is eligible for or is provided medical assista nce through Medicaid when enrolling an individual in the Plan or making a determination about the payments f or benefits received by a Covered Person under the Plan. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 113 THI RD PARTY RECO VERY PROVISION Reim bursement This s ection applies when a Covered Person, or the legal repre sentative, estate , or heirs of the Covered Person (sometimes collectively referred to as the \"Covered Person\") recovers damages, by settlement, verdict, or otherwise, for an Accidental Injury, S ickness, or other condition. If the Covered Person has made, o r in the future may make, such a recovery, including a recovery from any insurance carrier, the Plan will not cover either the reasonable value o f the services to tre at such an Accidental Injury or Illness or the treatment of such an Accidental Injury or I llness. These benefits are specifically excluded. Howe ver, if the Plan does advance moneys or provide care for such an Accidental Injury, Sickne ss, or other conditio n, the Covered Person shall promptly convey moneys or ot her property from any settlement, arbitration award, verdict or any insurance proceeds or monetary recovery from any party received by the Covered Person (or by the legal represen tative, estate or hei rs of the Covered Person), t o the Plan for the reasonable value of the medical benefits ad vanced or provided by the Plan to the Covered Person, regardless of whether or not [1] the Covered Person has been fully compensated, or \"made- whole\" for his or her loss; [2] liability for payme nt is admitted by the Covere d Person or any other party; or [3] the recovery by the Covered Person is itemized or called anything other than a recovery for medical expenses incurred. If a r ecovery is m ade, the Plan shall have f irst priority in payment ove r the Covered Person, or any other party, to receive reimbursement of the benefits advanced on the Covered Person' s behalf. This reimbursement shall be from any recovery made by the Covered Person, and inclu des, but is not limited to, uninsured and underinsu red motorist coverage, any No -Fault Auto Insurance, medical payment coverage (auto, homeowners or otherwise), wo rkers' compensation settlement, compromises or awards, other group insurance (including student plans), and direct recoveries from liable part ies. In or der to secure the rights of the Plan under this section, and because of the Plan's advancement of benef its, the Covered Person hereby [1] acknowledges that the Plan shall have first priority again st proceeds of any such settlement, arbitration a ward, verdict, or any other amounts received by the Covered Person; and [2] assigns the Plan any benefits the Covered Person may have under any automobile policy or other coverage, to the extent of the Plan's claim for reimburse ment. The Covered Person sha ll sign and deliver, at the request of the Plan or its agents, any documents needed to protect such priority or reimbursement right, or to effect such assignment of benefits. By accepting any benefits advanced by the Plan under this section, the Covered Pe rson acknowledges that any p roceeds of settlement of judgment, including a Covered Person's claim to such proceeds held by another person, held by the Covered Person or by another, are being held for the ben efit of the Pla n under these provisions. The C overed Person shall cooperate with th e Plan and its agents, and shall sign and deliver such documents as the Plan o r its agents reasonably request to protect the Plan's right of reimbursement, provide any rel evant information, and take such actions as the P lan or its agents reasonably request to assist the Plan making a full recovery of the reasonable value of the benefits provided. The Covered Person shall not take any action that prejudices the Plan' ri ghts of reimbursemen t and consents to the right of the Plan, by and through its agent, to impress an equitable lien or constructive trust on the proceeds of any settlement to enforce the Plan's rights under this section, and/or to set off from any future benefi ts otherwise pa yable under the Plan the value of benefits advanced under this section to the extent not recovered by the Plan. The P lan shall be responsible only for those legal fees and expenses to which it agrees in writing. No Covered Person hereu nder shall incur any expenses on behalf of the Plan in pursuit of the Plan's right s hereun der. Specifically, no cou rt costs or attorney's fees may be deducted from the Plan's recovery without the express written consent of the Plan. Any so- called \"Fund Do ctrine\" or \"Common F und Do ctrine\" or \"Attorney's Fund Doctrine\" shall not defeat t his right. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 114 Th e Plan shall recover the full amount of benefits advanced and paid hereunder, without regard to any claim or fault on the part of any beneficiary of Covered Person, whether under comparative negligence or otherwise. Su brogation Th is section applies when another party is, or may be considered, liable for a Covered Person's Ac cidental Injury, Sickness , or other condition (including insurance carriers who are fina ncial ly liable) and the Plan has advanced benefits. In c onsideration for the adva ncement of benefits, the Plan is s ubrogated to all of the rights of the Covered Person against any party liable for the Covered Person's Accidental Injury or Illness, or is or may be liable for the pa yment for the medical treatmen t of such Accidental Injury or occ upational Illness (including any insurance carrier), to the extent of the value of the medical benefits advanced to the Covered Person under the Plan. The Plan may as sert this right inde pendently of the Covered Person. This right includes, but is not limited to, the Covered Person's rights under uninsured and underinsured motorist c overage, any No- Fault Auto Insurance, medical payment coverage (auto, homeowners or othe rwise ), workers' com pensat ion coverage, or other insur ance, as well as the Covered Person's rights under the Plan to bring an action to clarify his or her rights under the Plan. The Plan is not obligated in any way to pursue this right independently or on behal f of the Covere d Pers on, but may choose to pursue i ts rights to reimbursement under t he Plan, at its sole discr etion. The Covered Person is obligated to cooperate with the Plan and its agents in order to protect the Plan's subrogation rights. Cooper ation means providing the Plan or its agents with any relevant information request ed by them, signing and delivering such documents as the Plan or its agents reasonably request to secure the Plan's subrogation claim, and obtaining the consent of the Plan or its agents before releasing any party from liability for payment of medical expe nses. If the Covered Person enters into litigation or settlement negotiations regarding the obligations of other parties, the Covered Person must not prejudice, in any way, the subrogation rights of the Plan under this section. In the event that the Cove red Person fails to cooperate with this provision, including executing any documents required herein, the Plan may, in addition to remedies provided elsewhere in the Plan and/or u nder the law, s et off from any future benefits otherwise payable under the Pl an the value of benefits advanced under this section to the extent not recovered by the Plan. The costs of legal representation of the Plan in matters related to subrogation shal l be borne solely by the Plan. The costs of lega l representation of the Cove red Person shall be borne solely by the Covered Person.

Th e Retiree und er Option 2, has 30 days from the time they begin drawing their annuity to enroll in the Retirement Health Plan. No documentation is required for the time between termination of employment and their qualifying to draw their annuity of other employer group he alth coverage. Opt ion 3: If a Ret iree meets all the eligibility requirements listed in Option 1, but currently have employer group health coverage under their Spouse, or new employment, they can delay the ir enrollment onto th e Retirement Health Plan. Once they experience a qualify ing event of involuntary loss of employer group health coverage, they have 30 days to enroll onto the Retirement Health Plan. They will need to provide documentation of unint errup ted group health coverage from their last day of em ployment up to their qualifying event. The member may have a need during this time to enroll on COBRA for a short period to avoid any break in service. Reh ired Retirees If a Medicare Retiree goes back to work as an Act ive Em ployee as a state or public sc hool Employee, and is eligible for benefits, he or she MUST come off the retirement health insurance and enroll in one of the active plans. Once the Employee terminates employment again, the Employee has t he option to re -enrol l in the retirement health pla n within 30 days of the loss of be nefits. If an Employee chooses not to enroll in the retirement health plan at the second time of termination, and obtains health insurance outside of the State and Public School Health P lan, the Employee will not have a qualifying event to enroll a second time in the retirement hea lth insurance. A n on-Medicare Retiree that goes bac k to work as an active state or public school Employee and is eligible for benefits MAY come off the retirem ent health insurance and enroll in one of the active plans. Once the Employee terminates employment again, the Employee has the option to re- enroll in the retirement health plan within 30 days of the loss of benefits. If an Employee chooses not to enroll in the retirement health plan at the second time of termination , and obtains health insurance out side of the State and Public School Health Plan, the Employee will not have a qualifying event to enroll a second time in the retirement hea lth insurance. A Retiree who return s to work as an Ark ansas State Employee or Publ ic Schoo l Employee is not eligible to re-enroll in an active plan. If a Retiree does not elect, decline , or meet the Arkansas Legislative Code eligibility requirements for retirement health ins urance during their 30- day electio n period, it is not an option to return to active ARBenefits January 1, 2021 116 employment a s a rehired Retiree to re- establish eligibility. Eligibility is determined at the initial time the individual elects to become an active Retiree and begins draw ing their retirement annuity.

RECIPROCITY S ERVICE Vesting S chedule: Emp loyment se rvice prior to July 1, 1997 requires 10 years of fully vested service. Employment service after J uly 1, 1997 requires five years of f ully vested service. (1) An E mployee fully vested as a state Em ployee AND fully vested as a public school Employee (a participating member under both APERS and ATRS and drawing a retirement annuity from each) may choose to enroll in either the ASE or PSE retiree health plan. Verificat ion by E BD is required. (2) Effec tive July 1, 1997 - Vesting for retirement changed from a 10 -year vesting to five years. Service prior to July 1, 1997 is still held to the 10-year v esting. (3) A Memb er, who is not fully vested under either system, will enroll in the re tiree health plan with the most vested years. Enrollment Procedures Members should notify EBD within 30 days of termination by submitting an Election F orm and a Spo usal Affidavit if th ey are continuing coverage for a Spouse from the active health plan coverage. Coverage will be effective the first of the month following the date on the Election Form. The Election Form can be accessed online at https://www. dfa.arkansas.gov/images/uploads/arBenefits/RetireeElection_ChangeForm.pdf . Adding a Spouse or Dependents at the initial enrollment onto the retirement health plan (1) At initial enrollment in retirement health insurance coverage, Retirees may only continue coverage on the Spouse/Dep endents that are currently covered on the active plan at the time of enrollment in the retirement plan. (2) Retirees may add newly acquired Dependents, i.e., newborn Children, adopted Children, or a new Spouse within 30 days of the event with supporting document ation. 2(a). If retiree health coverage is canceled on a dependent child, the decision is final and the dependent is no longer eligible for coverage under the plan. (3) A Spouse cannot be on the retirement health plan as a Dependent if they are currently employed and have health insurance available through their employer. Reti rees may bring them onto thei r plan if they experience a qualifying event of loss of employer group health coverage, but the Retiree must apply within 30 days of the event by completing an Election Form, Spousal Affidavit, and provide proof of continued group health coverage up until their qualifying event and submitt ing to EBD. A copy o f the Marriage License is al so r equired. 3(a). If retiree health coverage is canceled on a spouse other than leaving for continued employer coverage, the decision is fina l and the spouse is no longer eligible for coverage under the plan. (4) Retirees D O NOT have an open enrollment to add Dependents to their plan, butARBenefits January 1, 2021 117 Non- M edicare Retirees h ave t he option to change plans. (5) I f a Retiree has a Spouse on their plan that is a lso a re tired member of a state or public school retirement system, they can make a on e-time option and split off on separate plans, or they can move from separate plans to an Emp loyee/ Spouse pl an. This is a one -time option and member cannot return to the former p lan except for death of the policy holder. This one- time option is only available during Open Enrollment. (6 ) At open enrollment, a Retiree who is fully vested under both the State & Public Scho ol retirement systems can ma ke a one-time option and change to t he other retirement system. The vesting requirement does not include reciproci ty service. MED ICARE ELIGIBLE MEMBERS/DEPENDENTS Me mber and Dependents are required to send EBD a copy of their Medicare card. If Me dicare is due to End Stage Renal Di sease (ESRD), ARBenefits is required to be primary for a period of 30 months. During this 30- month period, premiums will remain as a non- Medicare Retiree. When the 30 - month period is ended, Medi care w ill become Primary and ARBen efits will be secondary. At that time premiums will reduce to the appropriate Medicare premium. It is the member's responsibility to notify EBD of an ESRD or disability status. When a Retiree or Spouse reac hes the age of 65, or becomes eligible for Medica re, the only plan option is the Medi care Primary Plan. When th is occurs, the member and Dependents will automatica lly be moved to the Medicare Primary Plan at the Premium level if they are currently enrolled in the Classic or Ba sic Plan. Em ployees have the option to terminate covera ge on their Spouse when he or she becomes Medicare- eligible and not be moved to the Me dicare Primary Plan, if the Employee wishes to remain on the Classic or Basic Plan. The Employee must submit an El ection Form, to EBD, request ing termination of the Spouse 60 days prior to the eligibility date of the Medicare for the Spouse, so that the pl an change will not automatically occur. After the plan change has been made, the Employee can not change back to their original plan until Open Enrollment for the next January eff ective date. Ni nety days prior to a Spouse becoming age 65, EBD will send a letter informing the Employee of the automatic move to the Medicare Primary Plan, due to the S pouse's Medicar e eligibility. If the Employee wishes to avoid this move and drop coverage on their Spouse, ther e will be included a form that the Employee will nee d to complete and send back to EBD 60 days prior to the Spouse becoming age 65. Appr oximately 60 days prior to a Retiree and/or their Spouse be coming age 65, EBD will se nd a let ter requesting Medicare in formation and a copy of any Medicare card(s). The Me mber must disclose if coverage is due to age, disability or End State Renal Disease. EBD is able to identify memb ers/Spouse s who are age 65 b ut are unable to identify me mbers wh o become Medicare eligible due to disability or End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). The Member is asked to notify EBD so that claims are paid according to Medicare rules. EBD will need a cop y of t he Member's Medicare card. NOTE: T he ARBenefits Medicare Premiu m Plan for Retirees will c oordinate as if Medicare Part A and Part B are both in force at the time of service. If the member does not have Part B, the Plan will pay a s tho ugh the member does h ave Medicare Part B and the member will have full financial responsibility for incurred claims. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 118 Terminating Retirement Health Plan Coverage Once you have exercised your one -time option to enroll in the retirement health insuran ce pl an and request that the coverage be terminated, t he decision is final and you will no longer be eligible to par ticipate in the plan. The only exception to this rule is if you cancel to go back as an Active Employee with a state or public school agenc y, and are eligible for ac tive benefits. You can re -enroll in the plan once you te rminate active employment again. This exception does not apply if you cancel retiree c overage to go back to active employment that is not affiliated with the state of public school agency. Death of Retiree (1) If a Retiree dies, an d has covered Dependents on the AR Benefits Plan at the time of death, the Dependents have the right to continue coverage under the Plan. Dependent Children may be covered until they reach the maximum age l imit for a Depe ndent Child. A surviving Spouse may continue coverage under the Plan p rovided payments are made timely. If a surviving Spouse or Dependent that was covered under the plan declines to enroll or cancels coverage after electing coverage, t hen t he surviving Spouse/Dependent has no further privileges under the Plan. Survi ving Dependents cannot add other D ependents to the Plan. (2) A Surviving Spouse/Dependent Packet will be sent to the Dependent(s) once EBD has received notification of the deat h of the Retiree. EB D requ ires a copy of the Death Cer tificate. Surviving Dependents will have 30 days from the date of the letter to submit an Election Form to EBD for enrollment. (3) If a Spouse /Dependent is not eligible to draw a survivor annuity from the Retir ee, premiums mu st be setup to be bank- drafted month ly. NOTE: If the Spouse and/or De pendents do not enroll in the retirement health plan or COBRA within their res pective enrollment periods, all privileges under the plan are terminated. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 119 CO NTINUATION COVE RAGE RIGHTS UNDER COB RA U nder federal law , the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), certain Employees and t heir families c overed under ARBenefits (the Plan) will be entitled to th e opportunity to elect a temporary extension of health coverage (called \"COBRA continuation coverage\") where coverage under the Plan would otherwise end. This notice is in tended to infor m Plan Participants and beneficiar ies, in summary fashion, of their rights and obligations under the continuation coverage provisions of COBRA, as amended and reflected in final and proposed regulations published by the Department of the Tre asury. This not ice is intended to reflect the law and does not grant or take away any rights under the law. C OBRA continuation coverage under the Plan is administ ered by the COBRA Administrator. Complete instructions on COBRA, as w ell as election forms and other info rmation, will be provided by the C OBRA Administrator to Plan Participants who become Qualified Beneficiaries und er COBRA. T here may be other optio ns available when group health cov erage is lost. For example, an individual may be eligible to b uy an individual plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace. By enrolling in coverage through the Marketplace, he or she may qualify for lower costs on their month ly premiums and lower out-of- pocket costs. Additionally, an individual may qualify for a 30-day special enrollment period for another group health plan for which he or she is eligible (such as a Spouse 's plan), even if that plan g enerally doesn't accept late enrollees. More information about these options is av ailable at www.healthcare.gov . W hat is COBRA continuation cove rage? COBRA continuation coverage is the temporary extension of group health plan coverage that must be offered to certain Plan Participants and their eligible family members (called \"Qualified Benefici aries\") at group rat es. The right to COBRA continuatio n coverage is triggered by the occurrence of a life event that results in the loss of coverage under the terms of the Plan (the \"Qualifying Event\"). The coverage must be identical to the Plan coverage t hat the Qualified Be neficiary had im mediately before t he Qualifying Event, or if the coverage has been changed, the coverage must be identical to the coverage provided to similarly situated active Employees who have not experienced a Qualifying Event (in other words, similarly situated non-C OBRA beneficiaries ). W ho can become a Qualified Beneficiar y? In general, a Qualified Beneficiary can be: (1 ) Any individual who, on the day before a Qualifying Event, is covered under a Plan by virtue of being on that day either a covered Employee, the Spouse of a covered Employee, or a Dependent Child o f a covered Employee . If, how ever, an individua l who otherwise qualifies as a Quali fied Beneficiary is denied or not offered coverage under the Plan under circumstances in which the denial or failure to offer constitutes a violation of applicable law, then the individual will be considered to have had th e Plan coverage and will be considered a Qualified Beneficiary if tha t i ndividual experiences a Qualifying Event . (2 ) Any Child w ho is born to or placed for adoption with a covered Employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage, and any individual who is covered by the Plan as an alternat e r ecipient under a qualified medical support order. If, how ever, an individual who otherwise qualifies as a Quali fied Beneficiary is denied or not of fered coverage under the P lan under circumstances in which the denial or failu re to offer constitutes a violation of applicable law, the n th e individual will be considere d to have had the Plan coverage and will be consid ered a Qualified Beneficiary if that individual experiences a Qualifying Event. T he term \"covered Employee\" includes any individual who is provided coverage under t he Plan due to his or her performance of services for the employer sponsoring the Plan (e.g., common-law Employees (full or part- time), self-employed individuals, independent contractor, or corporate director). However, this provision does ARBenefits January 1, 2021 120 not establish eligibility of these individuals. Eligibility for Plan C overage shall be determined in accordance with Plan Eligibility provisions. An individual is not a Qualified Ben eficiary if the individual's statu s as a covered Employee is attributable to a period in which t he individual was a nonresident alien who received f rom the individual's Employer no earned income that constituted income from sources with in the United States . If, on a ccount of the prec eding reason, an individual is not a Qualified Beneficiary, th en a Spouse or Dependent Child of the individual wil l also not be considered a Qualified Beneficiary by virtue of the relationship to the indivi dual. Each Qualified Beneficiar y (including a Child who is born to or placed for adoption with a covered Employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage) must be offered the opportunity to make an independe nt election to receive COBRA conti nuation coverage. What is a Qualifying Event? A Qualifying Event is any of the following if the Plan provided that the Plan participant would lose coverage (i.e.: cease to be covered under the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately before the Qualifying Event) in the absence of COBRA continuation coverage: (1) The death of a covered Employee. (2) The termination (other than by reason of the Employee's gross misconduc t) or reduction of hours of a co vered Employee's e mployment. (3) The divorce or legal separation of a covered Employee from the Employee's Spouse. If the Employee reduces or eliminates th e Employee's Spo use's Plan coverag e in anticipation of a divorce or le gal separation, and a divorce or legal separation later occurs, then the divor ce or legal separation may be considered a Qualifying Event even though the Spouse's coverag e was reduced or eliminated befo re the divorce or le gal separation. (4) A cover ed Employee's enrollment in any part of the Medicare program. (5) A Dependent Child's ceasing to satisfy the Plan's req uirements for a Dependent Child (for example, attain ment of the maximum age for dependency under the Plan). If the Qualify ing Event causes the covered Emplo yee, or the covered Spouse or a Dependent Child of the covered Employee, to cease to be covered under the Plan under the same terms and conditions as in effe ct immediately b efore the Qualif ying Event , the persons losing such cover age become Qualified Benef iciaries under COBRA if all the other conditions of COBRA are also met. For example, any increase in contribution that must be paid by a cov ered Employee , or the Spouse, or a Dependent Chi ld of the covered Employee, f or coverage under the Plan that results from the occurrence of one of the events listed above is a loss of coverage. The taking of leave under the F amily and Medical Leave Act of 199 3, as amended (\"FMLA\") doe s not constitute a Qualifying Event. A Qualifying Event will occur, however, if an Employee does not return to employment at the end of the FMLA leave and all o ther COBRA conti nuation coverage c onditions are present. If a Qualifyi ng Event occurs, it occurs on the last day of FMLA leave and the applicable ma ximum coverage period is measured from this date (unless coverage is lost at a later dat e and the Plan provi des for the exte nsion of the requi red periods, in which case the maxim um coverage date is measur ed from the date when the coverage is lost.) Note that the covered Employee and family members will be entitled to COBRA contin uation coverage even if they failed to pay the Employe e portion of premiums for coverage under the Plan during the F MLA leave. For non- FMLA leaves of absence, the COBRA Qualifying Event date will be the day after the leave ends, if the Employee does not return to work i n an Eligible Class. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 121 W hat factors should be considered when determ ining to elect COBRA continuation coverage? When considering other options for health covera ge, Qualified Be neficiaries shou ld consider: ( 1) Prem iums. This plan can charge up to 102% of total plan premiums for COBRA coverage. Other options, like coverage on a Spouse's plan or through the Marketplace, may be less expensive . Q ualified Beneficiarie s have special enrol lment rights und er federal law (HI PAA). They have the right to request special enrollment in ano ther group health plan for which they are otherwise eligible (such as a plan sponsored by a Spouse's employer) within 30 days after Plan coverag e ends due to one of the Qualify ing Events listed above. ( 2) Provider Networks. If a Qual ified Beneficiary is curre ntly getting care or treatment for a condition, a ch ange in health coverage may affect access to a particular health care Provider. An indiv idual may want to check to see if th eir current health care Providers participate in a net work i n considering options for health coverage. ( 3) Drug Formularies. For Qualified Beneficiaries taking medication, a change in health coverag e m ay affect costs for me dication - and in some cases, the medication may not b e covere d by a nother plan. Qualified beneficiaries should check to see if current medications are listed in dr ug for mularies for other health coverage. ( 4) Severance payments. If COBRA rights arise because the Employee has lost his job and t here is a s everance package available from the employer, the former employer may have offered to pa y s ome or all of the Employee's C OBRA payments for a period of time. This can affect the timi ng o f coverage available in the Marketplace. In this scenario, the Employee may want to contact the Department of Labo r at 1 -866-444-3272 to dis cuss options. (5 ) Medicare Eligibility. Individuals sho uld be aware of how COBRA coverage coordinates with Medicare eligibility. If an individual is eligible for M edicare at the t ime of the Qualifyin g Event , or if he or she will become eligible soon after the Qualifying Event, he or she has eight months t o en roll in Medicare after employment - related health coverage ends. Electing COBRA coverag e doe s not extend this eight-month period. For more inform ation, s ee h ttps://www. Medicare.gov /sign-up-change-plans/. (6 ) Service Areas. If benefits under the Plan are limited to specific service or coverage areas, ben efits may not be available to a Qu alified Beneficiary who moves out of the area. (7 ) Other Cost -Sharing. In addition to premiums or contributions for health coverage, the Plan requires participants to pay Copayments, Deductibles, coinsurance, or other amounts as benefit s a re used. Qualified beneficiaries should check to see what the cost -sharing require ments are fo r ot her health coverage options. For example, one option may have much lower monthly premiums , but a much higher Deductible and higher Copayments. W hat is the procedure f or obtaining COBRA continuation coverage? The Plan h as conditioned the availability of COBRA continuation coverage upon the timely election of such coverage. An election is timely if it is made during the election period. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 122 W hat is the election period and how long must it last? The election period is the time period within whi ch the Qualifie d Beneficiary mu st elect COBRA con tinuation coverage under the Plan. The election period must begin no later than the date the Qualified Beneficiary would lose coverage on account of the Qualifying Event and ends 60 days after the later of the date the Qualified Beneficia ry would lose cove rage on account of the Qualifying Event or the date notice is provided to the Qualified Beneficiary of his or her right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. If coverage is not elected within the 60- day period, all rights to elect COBRA continuation coverage are forfeited. N OTE: If a covered Emp loyee who has been terminated or experienced a reduction of hours qualifies for a trade read justment allowance or alternativ e trade adjustment assistance under a federal law call ed the Trade Act of 2002, as extended by the Trade Preferences Extension Act o f 2015, and the Employee and his or her covered Dependents have not elected COBR A coverage with in the normal election period, a s econd opportunity to elect COBRA coverage will be made availab le for themselves and certain family members, but only within a limited period of 60 days or less and only during the six months imm ediately after their group health plan coverage e nded. Any person who qualifies or thinks that he and/or his family members may qualify for assistance under this special provision should contact the Plan Administrator for further information about the special second electio n period. If continuation coverage is elected under th is extension, it will not become effective prior to the beginning of this special second election period. Is a covered Employee or Qualified Beneficiary responsible for informing the Plan Administrator of the occurrence of a Qualifying Event? The Plan will offer COBRA continuation coverage to Qualified Beneficiaries only after the Plan Administrator has been timely notified that a Qualifying Event h as occurred. The employer (if the em ployer is not the Plan Adm inistrator) will notify the Plan Administrator of th e Qualifying Event within 30 days following the date coverage ends when the Qualifying E vent is: (1 ) The end of employment or reduction of hours of employment; (2 ) Deat h of the Employee; (3 ) Commence ment of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employer; or, (4 ) Entitlement of the employee to any par t of Medicare. I MPORTANT: F or the other Qualifying Events (divorce or legal separation of the Employee and Spou se or a Dependent Child's losing eligibility for coverage as a Dependent Child), the Cover ed Person or someone actin g on their behalf must notify the Plan Adminis trator within 60 days after the Qualifying Event occurs, using the procedures specified below. If these proc edures are not f ollowed or if the no tice is not provided in writing to the Plan Administrator or its designee during the 60 -day notice period, any Spouse or Dependent Child who loses coverage will not be offered the option to elect continua tion coverage. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 123 NOTICE PROCEDURES: Any notice must be i n writing . Oral notice, including notice by telephone, is not acceptable. The notice mus t be mailed, faxed o r hand -delivered to the Plan Admin istrator. If mailed, the notice mu st be postmarked no later than the last day of the required notice period. Any notice provided must state: the name of the plan or plans under which coverage has been l ost or is being lost, the na me and address of th e Employee covered under the plan, the name(s) and addres s(es) of the Qualified Beneficiary(ies), and the Q ualifying Event and the date it happened. If the Qualifying Event is a divorce or lega l separation , the notice must includ e a copy of the di vorce decree or the legal separation agreement. There are oth er notice requirements in other contexts, for exampl e, in order to qualify for a disability extension. Once the Plan Administrator or its desi gnee receives timely notice that a Qualifying Event has occurred, COBRA continuation c overage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficiaries. Each Qualified Beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covere d Em ployees may elect COBRA continua tion coverage for th eir Spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation covera ge on behalf of their Children. For each Qualified B eneficiary who elects COBRA continuation coverage, COBRA continuation coverage will begi n on the date that p lan coverage would otherwise have been lost. If an individual does not elect continuation covera ge within the 60- day election period described above , the right to elect continuation coverage will be lost. Is a waiver before the end of the election peri od effective to end a Qual ified Beneficiary's election rights? If, during the election period, a Qualified Beneficiary waives COBRA continuation coverage, the waiver can be revoked at an y time before th e end of the elect ion period. Revocation of the waiver is an election of COBRA c ontinuation coverage. However, if a waiver is later revoked, coverage need not be provided retroactively (that is, from the date of the loss of coverage until t he waiver is rev oked). Waivers and revocations of waivers are consider ed made on the date they a re sent to the COBRA Administrator. Is COBRA coverage available if a Qualified Benefic iary has other group health plan c overage or Medicare? Qualified benef iciaries who are entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage may do so even if they are covered under another group health plan or are entitled to Medicare benefits on or before the da te on which COBRA is elected. Howeve r, a Qualified Beneficiary's COBRA coverage will terminate a utomatically if, after electing COBRA, he or she bec omes entitled to Medicare or becomes covered under other group health plan coverage. When may a Qualifie d Beneficiary's COBRA cont inuation coverage be terminated? During the election period, a Qualified Beneficiary may waive COBRA continuation coverage. Except for an interr uption of coverage in connection with a waiver, CO BRA continuation coverage that has been elected for a Qualified Beneficiary must extend for at least the period beginning on the date of the Qualifying Event and ending not before the earliest of the fo llowing dates: (1) The la st day of the applicable maximum coverage period. (2) The first day for whi ch Timely Paymen t is not made to the Plan with respect to the Qualifie d Beneficiary. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 124 (3) The date upon which the Employer ceases to provide any group healt h plan (including a successor plan) to any employe e. (4) The date, after the date of the election, that the Qualified Beneficiary first becomes entitled to Medicare (eithe r part A or part B, whichever oc curs earlier). (5) In the case of a Qualified B eneficiary entitled to a disability extension, the later of: (a) (i) 29 months after th e date of the Qualifying E vent, or (ii) the first day of the month that is mor e than 30 days after the date of a final determination under Title II or XVI of the Social Security Act that the disabled Qualified Beneficiar y whose disability resulted in the Q ualified Beneficiary's ent itlement to the disability extension is no longer disabled, whichever is earlier; or, (b) the end of the maxi mum coverage period that applies to the Qualified Beneficiary without regard to the disability extension. The Plan can terminate the coverage of a Q ualified Benefic iary for cause on th e same basis that the Plan termina tes the coverage of similarly situated non- COBRA beneficiaries ; for example, f or the submission of a fraudulent claim. In the case of an individua l who is not a Qualified Beneficiary and who is receiving cove rage under the Plan solely because of the individual 's relationship to a Qualified Beneficiary, if the Plan's obligation to make COBRA conti nuation coverage ava ilable to the Qu alified Beneficiar y ceases, the Plan is not obligated to make coverage available to the individual who is not a Qualified Beneficiar y. What are th e ma ximum coverage p eriods for COBRA continuation cove rage? The maximum coverage periods a re based on the type of the Qualifying Event and the status of the Qualified B eneficiary, as shown below: (1) In the case of a Qu alifying Event that is a termination of employment or reduction of hours of employment, the maximum coverage period ends 18 months after the Qualifying Event if there is not a disability extension and 29 mo nths after the Q ualifying Event if there is a disa bility extension. (2) In the case of a covered Employee's enrollment in the Medicare program before experiencing a Qualifying Event that is a termination of employment or re duction of hours of employment, the maximum coverage period for Qualified Beneficiaries ends on the later of: (a) 36 months after the date the co vered Employee bec omes enrolled in the Medicare progra m. This extension does not apply to the covered Employee; or, (b) 18 months (or 2 9 mo nths, if there i s a disability e xtension) after th e date of the covered Employee's ter mination of employment or reduction of hours of employment. (3) In the case of a Qual ified Beneficiar y who is a Child born to or placed f or adoption with a covered Employe e during a period of COBRA continuation coverage, the maximum coverage period is the maximum coverage period applicable to the Qualifying Event giving rise to the per iod of COBRA continuation coverage d uring which the Child was born or placed for adoption. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 125 (4) In the case of any other Qualifying Event than that described above, the maximum coverage period ends 36 months after the Qualifying Event. Under what circumstances can t he maximum coverage period be expanded? If a Qualifying Event that gives rise to an 18- month or 29- month max imum coverage pe riod is followed, within that 18 - or 29- month period, by a second Qualifying Eve nt that gives rise to a 36 -months maximum coverage period, the original period is expanded to 36 months, but only for individuals who are Qualif ied Beneficiaries at the time of and with respect to both Qualifying Events. In no cir cumstance can the COBRA maximum coverage period be expanded to more than 36 months after the date of the first Qualifying Event. The Plan Administrator must be notified o f the second Qua lifying Event within 60 days of the second Qualifying Event. This noti ce must be sent to P lan Administrator in accordance with the procedures above. How d oes a Qualified Beneficiary become entitled to a di sability extension? A disability e xtension will be granted i f an individual (whether or not the covered Employee ) who is a Qualified Beneficiary in connection with the Qualifying Event that is a termination or reduction of hours of a co vered Employee's e mployment, is determined under Title II or XVI of the Social S ecurity Act to have been disabled at any time during the first 60 days of COBRA continuation coverage. To qualify for the disability extensi on, the Qualified Be neficiary must a lso provide the Pl an Administrator with notice of the disability determination o n a date that is both within 60 days after the date of the determination and before the end of the original 18 -month maximum coverage. This notice should be sent to Plan Administrator in accordance with the procedures above. Does the Plan require payment for COBRA continuation coverage? For any period of COB RA continuation cove rage under the P lan, qualified benef iciaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage must pay for COBRA continuation coverage. Qual ified beneficiaries will pay up to 102% of the applicable premium and up to 150% of the appl icable premium f or any expanded period of COBRA cont inuation coverage covering a disabled Qualified Beneficiary due to a disability extension. The Plan will termina te a Qualified Beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage as of the first day of any peri od for which Timely Payment is not made. Must the Plan allow payment for COBRA continua tion coverage to be made in monthly installments? Yes. The Plan is also permitted to allow f or payment at ot her intervals. What is Timely Payment for payment for COBRA continuation c overage? Timely Payment means a payment made no later than 30 days after the first day of th e coverage perio d. Payment that is made to the Pla n by a later date is also considered Timely Payment if either under the terms of the Plan, covered employees or Qualified Beneficiaries are allowed until that later date to pay for their coverage for th e per iod or under the terms of an arrangement between th e Employer and the entity that pro vides Plan benefits on the Employer's behalf, the Employer is allowed until that later date to pay for coverage of similarly situated non- COBRA beneficiaries for the peri od. Notwiths tanding the above paragraph, the Plan does not require payment for any period of COBRA continuation coverage for a Qualified Beneficiary earlier than 45 days after th e dat e on which the election of COBRA continuation cover age is made for that Qualified Ben eficiary. Payment is consi dered made on the date on which it is postmarked to the Plan. If Timely Payment is mad e to the Plan in an amount that is not significantly less than the amo unt the Plan requires to b e paid for a period of coverage, then the amount pai d will be deemed to satisfy the Plan's requirement for the amount to be paid, unless the Plan notifies the Q ualified Benefic iary of the amount of the deficiency and grants a reas onable period of time for payment of the deficiency to be made. A \"reasonable period of time\" is 30 days after the notice is provided. A shortfall in a Timely Payment is not significant if it is no grea ter than the lesse r of $50 or 10% of the required amount.

By _____________________________________ Date ____________________________________ Witness _________________________________ Date ____________________________________ ARBenefits January 1, 2021 135 A Prescription Drug Program covers most members of the Plan with the excep tion being the Public School Medicare- Primary Retirees. Coverag e under the Prescription Drug P rogram is not available without participation in the med ical p lan, meaning that a member can not elect to have c overage for his or her prescription drugs as a stan d-alone plan. The Prescri ption Drug Program covers a wide sele ction of medications, but not a ll prescription drugs available in the United States are cover ed. The Plan uses an established Formulary of covered dru gs and, i n most cases, has the drugs classi fied into one of six tiers . Medications that are not on the for mulary are not covered by the Plan and any cost associated with the drug would be the r espons ibility of the member. Tier I Generic Tier II Formulary Brand (Preferred) Tier III Non- Formulary Br and (Non -Preferred) Tier I V Specialty Reference Pricing Brand t o Generic Incentive Note: See section, \"How much will my prescription cost?\" Who coor dinate s the prescription drug progra m? EBD has a contract with an outside third -party company who serves a s the PBM (Pharmacy Benefi t Manager) for the Plan. The PBM has the responsibility to contract with pharmacies, negotiate discounts, and work with EBD to cre ate a quality benefit program for the membership. What t ypes of p rescription drugs and supplies are covered? Drugs prescribed by a physician that require a prescr iption under federal law, and a re purchased in the United States at an in -network pharm acy, u nless otherwise excluded from the plan Diabetic s upplies such as l ancets and test strips when prescr ibed by a physician. Are there any limitations on the covered drugs? Benefits for any one pre scription may be limited to: Quantity limits established by the Plan Refills only up to the time specified by a physici an Refills up to one year from the date of order by a physician Refer ence based pricing on certain medicat ions instead of a flat co -pay ( indicated as RP on the PDL) Prior authorization review o n cert ain medications Step therapy guidelines establish ed by the plan How much will my prescription drugs cost? The cost of a presc ription at an in -network pharmacy wil l depend on a variety of issues , such as your plan option, the tier of the medication, and ho w much of your deductible has been met, if applic able. If you are a member of the ARBenefits or ARBe nefits Retiree plans (excl uding the Public School Medicare - Primary Retirees), the cost of most covered prescription drugs will be tied to a co- payment based on the tier to which the drug has been assigned. The co -pay amounts are shown in the Schedule of Be nefits. The co -pay is the maximum cost that a member will pay f or a drug in a particular tier although the member will pay less if Prescription Drug Coverage ARBenefits January 1, 2021 136 the drug price is l ower t han the fixed co- pay. Some med ications are not as signed t o a co -payment tier, but are priced at a fi xed rate per pill. Your cost for a prescription with this pricing method varies greatly depending on the prescription and pharmacy. Prescriptions that are p riced at a fixed rate per pill are indicated on t he Prefe rred Drug List (PDL) with an (RP) for refer ence pricing. If you are a member of the ARBenefits HD Classic or Basic plans, you will be re sponsible for the total cost of the prescription (after any ap plicable network discount) unt il you have satisfi ed your deductibl e. After the deductible has been m et, you will be responsibl e for a portion of the cost as a co-insurance up to the point when y our maximum out -of-pocket annual co -insurance limit has been r eached. When the annual co -insurance limit has be en reach ed, the P lan will cover 100% of the cost of all covered medications. Medications listed as reference priced are considered non- covered on the Classic and Basic plans and will not apply to the deducti ble, annual coinsurance, or out of pocket limits. In addi tion, med ications listed as reference priced will not apply to the annual out -of-pocket limits for members enrolled in the Premium or Primary plans. Please note: the ASE Basic plan does not have an annual coinsurance limit. The d eductible is equal to the o ut-of- pocket amount. The plan will pay 100% once this amount has been reached. What is the Brand Generic Program? Currently, brand- name medications that are available in the generic form are covered with a brand copayment. Choos ing to fill a brand -name dr ug that i s available in an equivalent gener ic form will re - quire a t iered copayment PLUS the difference i n the cost between the generic and equivalent brand -name drug. (Please note brand name drugs with equivalent generics avail able will be non- covered on the Clas sic and Basic plans, and will not apply to the annual out -of-pocket limits on the Premium and Primary plans.) Example : Drug B is a brand drug and cost $150. Drug B has a generic drug avail able and it cost $30. For a one-month supply, the cost wo uld be as follows. Benefit example prior to 9/1/2012 Generic Drug Cos t $30 Non- Preferred Brand Drug Co st $150 Member Copay - $10 Member Copay - $ 60 Plan Cost $20 Plan Cost $ 90 Benefit exampl e prior to 9/1/2012 Generic Drug Cost $30 Non- Preferred Brand Drug Cost $150 Member Copay - $10 Member Copay - $ 20 Plan Cost $20 Plan Cost $130 If ther e is a clinically based reason your physician wil l not pr escribe a generic medication for you, he or she can contact EBRx at ( 866) 564- 8258 to inquire about an ove rride. How is a prescription filled at an Out -of-Network pharmacy? If a prescription is filled at an out -of-network pharm acy, the member will be res ponsible for 100% of the cost of the drug w hen the medication is dispensed. The plan does not allow covera ge for out -of-network pharmacies. Confirmation of participating pharmacies may be obtai ned by calling the number on your ARBenefits card and p ressing 1 for assistance. How are prescription dru gs assigned to a Tier? As new medications receive FDA approval and are released to the open market, they are excluded from coverage until the Arkansas State and Public School's Drug Util ization Evaluation Committe e (DUEC) and the Prescription Benefit Consultant (University of Arkan sas for Medical Sciences, College of Pharmacy) reviews them. Their r ecommendations are then taken to the State and Public Sc hool L ife & Health Insurance Board (the Board) for a de termination, whic h is in the best interest of our group as a whole. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 137 When a covered, formulary preferred brand nam e drug becomes available in a g eneric alternative, the new generic will be placed at th e same Tier as the brand and the bra nd will be subject to the b rand/gene ric pricing incentive. How do I f ind out, which drugs are i n which Tier? We publish a Preferred Drug List (PDL) that contains many of the more commonly prescribed medications and classifies the drugs into co- payment tie rs. (See heading \"D oes the Plan have any special programs, limitations , or restrictions?\" for ad ditional information.) The PDL is ava ilable on the central web site of the Plan at www.AR Benefi ts.org , and is updated as nee ded. If your medic ation is not listed on the PDL, you can obtai n cove rage information by callin g the number on your ARBenefits card and pressing \"1\" for assistance. Alternatively, you may log in to the AR - Benefits memb er portal (www.ARBenefits.o rg), click on \"Member Links \", the n \"Personal Pharmacy Recor ds\" under the heading \"Internal Links \". The prescription drug benefit member portal will open. Coverage for medications can be fou nd by clicking on \"Drug Price Check\" and then typing in the name o f the drug. What are my opt ions f or purchasing medication u nder the Plan? The Prescription Drug Program offers two convenient and cost effective ways to purchase prescription medic ations . The combined medical/prescri ption drug card may be used to obtai n prescription medications a t a discounted cost from a part icipating retail pharmacy. The Mail O rder Prescription Drug Program does not offer additional cost savings on medicati ons; howeve r, does provide a member with the convenience of receiving up to a 3 -month supply of medicati ons at their doorstep, paying one (1) co -pay for each month's supply. The Mail Order Program is limited to medications that are required on a long ter m or mainte nance basis. Contact ARBenefi ts for information regarding prescri ptions that can be filled th rough the Mail Order Program. P lease note specialty medications are limited to a one month supply through all distribution services . How do I use th e Ret ail Pr escription Drug Card Program? Drugs that are prescribed for short -term use should be filled fr om a n etwork pharmacy using your combined medical and pharmacy ident ification card. The network includes most pharmacies in Arkansas and pharmacies n ation wide. Most chain stores participate in this network, as well as many ind ependent pharmacies across the na tion. Confirmation of part icipating pharmacies may be obtained by calling ARBenefits. Most retail prescriptions are limited to a 31 -day supply. Pres criptions are dispensed according to the instructions of the prescribin g physician. If the medical condit ion is such that the presc ription drug is to be taken over a prolonged period of time, (months or even years), you may be able to receive up to a 93 -day supply. Contact ARBenefits to verify if your medic ation will be cov ered for a 93 -day supply at a retail pharmacy or the mail o rder prescription drug program. (Exam ples of medications not covered for more than a 31-day supply include antidepress ants, proton pump inhibitors, stimulants including those for ADHD, sleep aides, and non- steroidal anti- inflammatory agents.) How do I u se the Pharmacy Mail Order Program? The mail order prescription program is designed to assist individuals who take the same medica tion for a long period of time for conditions suc h as diabetes, hi gh blood pressure, heart, or thyro id conditions. You will ne ed to obtain two (2) 31- day supplies of medication or two fills at a network retail pharmacy before the mail order program c an be utilized. This helps to ensure that prescriptions are appropriate for the duration of therapy. If medication is still required after the two (2) 31 -day supplies or two (2) fills, you may ask your physician for a prescription for up to a 93- day s upply, if a ppropriate. The mail order program allows you to obtain a 93- day supply of certain medications at on e time for three (3) month s co-payments. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 138 You may use the mail order option by calling the PBM's mail order provider at 1- 855-873-8739. Each mai l order pre scription is limited to a maximum quantity limit of a 93- day suppl y. Pharmacies are required by law to dispense the prescripti on in the exact quantity specified by the physician. Therefore, if the quantity prescribed is for less than 93 days per refill, the mail order pharmacy will fill the exact quantit y written by the physician. Please be aware t hat no t all medications are available through the mail order program. Contact ARBenefits to verify that your prescription is covered through mail order. Why does the Plan encourage generic drugs? A generic drug is identical in chemical composition to its brand name counterpart, has been approved by the Food and Drug Admini stration (FDA) to be therapeutically equivalent, and is as effective as the brand name produc t. The use of generics perform s a vital role in c ontrolling the cost of prescription drugs for both the participant and the Pl an. Who do I contact for drug inform ation? If your physician or pharmacist is unable to answer your drug information questions, you can call the Arkansas Drug Information Center, a service provid ed by the UAMS College of Pharmacy at 1-888-228-1233. What about prescriptions for weight loss o r smoking cessation? If participating in the Tobacco Cessation Program, you can re ceive nicot ine replacement patches, the medications bupropio n (generic for Zy ban), or Chantix at no cost if enr olled and approved by the smoking cessation program. Coverage f or bupropion and Chantix is available to members who do not wish to participate in the progra m; however, standard tier co -payments will apply. To enroll in the program, you may call EBD M ember Services at 1 -877-815-1017. The PDL reflects which tier each me dication falls under. Weight loss medications are not a covered benefit. Does the Plan have any special programs, limitati ons, or restriction s? The Pharmacy B enefits Manager for the Plan has several cost saving initiatives in place designed to assist our prescription drug program in delivering the best possible healthcare at the most r eason able cost. The programs described be low are Prior Autho rization, Quantity Limits, Daily Dose Edits, Step T herapy, Reference Pricing, and New Generics. Medications listed on the PDL are marked with the abbreviations PA, QL, ST, RP, or NG when applicabl e. Prior A uthorization (PA) The Prior Au thorization program helps to ensure the appropriate usage of cer tain medications by applying FDA approved indications and the manufac turer's guidelines to the utilization of certain medications. The DUEC, Pharmacy B enefi ts Man ager, and pharmacy benefits co nsultant, (Universi ty of Arkansas fo r Medical Sciences College o f Phar macy), have identified the medications that have a high potenti al for serious side effects, high costs, or high abuse potential. The following s teps should be taken in order to obtain a Prior Authorizatio n: Your physicia n may contact EBRx (Evidence Based Prescription drug call ce nter at the UAMS College of Pharmacy) by calling 1- 866-564-8258 to discuss prescription drugs that require prior author ization. A team of pharmacists is availab le to evaluate the information provi ded by your physician. Forms are n ot faxed to your physician's office, as all reviews are handled over the phone. ARBenefits January 1, 2021 139 Once the prior authorization clinical guidelines are met, your pr ior authori zation will be approved and entered into the system.
