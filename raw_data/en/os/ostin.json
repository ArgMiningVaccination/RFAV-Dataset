It's a vital organ that often goes unnoticed until something goes wrong. And if you're one of the millions of people worldwide living with [diabetes](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/introduction-to-diabetes/), your pancreas is likely at the root of the problem. The connection between the pancreas and diabetes is fascinating and complex. This connection involves a delicate balance of hormones, enzymes, and blood sugar levels. In this article, we'll explore the inner workings of the pancreas and its crucial role in regulating glucose levels in the body. From insulin production to pancreas diabetes to pancreatic cancer, we'll cover it all, so buckle up. You'll get to learn about this small yet valuable organ and its connection to one of the most common chronic diseases of our time. The Pancreas Imagine you're hungry and ready to grab a delicious meal. But before you take a bite, let's give a cheer to the organ responsible for making digestion possible - the pancreas! This little organ may be small in size, but it's mighty in its function. The pancreas is in your abdomen in the centre. It is positioned between your stomach and spine. Pancreas produces necessary enzymes that enable the breakage of food and help regulate blood glucose. It's like a secret weapon that works tirelessly behind the scenes to keep your body in balance. Without this incredible gland, we wouldn't be able to enjoy food or maintain blood sugar at normal levels. One of the pancreas's main jobs is to produce enzymes that help break down the food you eat. These enzymes are like tiny workers that break up big chunks of food into smaller pieces. When the pancreas function insulin, it helps your body absorb all the nutrients it needs. Without the enzymes, your body won't get the energy required by it to work properly. The pancreas function insulin. It is insulin that helps keep your blood glucose levels in check. When you eat something that contains carbohydrates, your body breaks them down into sugar. Insulin's role includes taking the sugar from the blood straight into the cells. In the cells, the sugar provides energy and helps them function. The absence of pancreas function insulin in your blood can make your sugar level surge too high. This could lead to some severe health troubles. So, to sum it up, the pancreas is like a superhero that helps break down your food and regulates your blood sugar levels. It may be small, but it sure does pack a powerful punch!

But don't worry! We'll explain it to you in a way that's easy to understand and maybe even a little fun! Diabetes is a lifestyle disorder that can happen to anyone. In this, your body has difficulty maintaining your blood glucose at normal levels. Usually, from the pancreas insulin gets released, which helps your body control the amount of sugar in your blood. But if your body doesn't make enough pancreas insulin, or if it doesn't use pancreas insulin properly. Then sugar stays in your blood and can cause all sorts of problems. Diabetes Types There are two prominent varieties of diabetes. The first one is Type 1 diabetes, and the next variety is Type 2 diabetes. Type 1 Diabetes It is an immunity disorder in which our body's immune system damages some insulin-producing cells. In this diabetes type, usually, the children and young population are the ones majorly affected. They require lifelong pancreas insulin therapy to manage themselves. Type 2 Diabetes It is more common and usually develops in adulthood. However, it's becoming more common in children as well. With type 2 diabetes, your body makes insulin, but it either doesn't make enough, or it doesn't use it properly. This type of pancreas diabetes can often be managed with lifestyle changes like exercise and diet. Although some people may need medication to help control their blood sugar levels. There are also other types of diabetes, like gestational diabetes, that can occur during pregnancy, and some rare genetic forms of diabetes. Living with diabetes nowadays is easily manageable but only possible with specific diets and constraints. So with diabetes, too, you can live a happy and healthy life. Diabetes and Pancreas Connection Certainly, the pancreas diabetes connection is very closely related. The pancreas is a critical organ that oversees the sugar levels in our blood. Moreover, when we talk of diabetes, the pancreas insulin is at the center of it all. To understand how the pancreas insulin is linked with diabetes, we first need to know how the body processes glucose (sugar), which is the primary source of energy for our cells. When we consume food, especially high-carb items, our body breaks these carbs into glucose. This glucose enters our blood and provides us with a dose of energy. However, this rise in sugar levels in our blood activates the pancreas to secrete insulin. Pancreas insulin or pancreas function insulin allows glucose to be absorbed in our cells for energy. Additionally, pancreas insulin makes the liver and cells stock surplus glucose for later. In a healthy individual, this procedure happens spontaneously, and blood glucose exists in a normal range. However, in people with pancreatic diabetes, something goes wrong with this system. So what causes the pancreas to stop producing insulin? Come, let's dig a bit deeper.

In this, the body is incapable of secreting enough pancreas insulin. The immune system wrongly strikes the insulin-secreting tissues in the pancreas insulin, thus leading to high blood sugar levels and pancreas diabetes type 1. Pancreas and Type 2 Diabetes On the other hand, type 2 diabetes, which is usually diagnosed in adults. This type occurs when the body becomes resistant to pancreas insulin. Or when the insulin is not created in sufficient amounts to keep up with the body's demands. This leads to elevated sugar levels, harming the body over time. So, this answers what causes the pancreas to stop producing insulin. Therefore, [people with diabetes](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/exercises-for-people-with-diabetes/) often need to monitor their blood sugar levels regularly. They must take medications and make lifestyle changes to manage their condition and prevent high pancreas diabetes levels. In conclusion, the pancreas and diabetes are both associated, as the pancreas secretes insulin. Each dysfunction in the pancreas insulin causes to hamper its production. This creates an elevated sugar level condition and ultimately develops pancreas diabetes.

The probability is so significantly higher in diabetes patients that if their sugar level remains on the higher side, their chances of pancreatic cancer are more than 50%. Pancreatic cancer is a dangerous and often fatal disease. It is often tough to detect it in its initial stages.

Common signs include pain in the abdomen, significant weight reduction, reduced pancreas insulin production, jaundice, and exhaustion.
