Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Prior to initiating secukinumab, complete all age appropriate immunizations; non-live vaccinations received during treatment with secukinumab may not elicit an immune response sufficient to prevent disease. - siponimod Serious - Use Alternative (1)siponimod decreases effects of hepatitis b vaccine by immunosuppressive effects; risk of infection. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Pause vaccinations beginning 1 week before initiating siponimod and for 4 weeks after stopping treatment. Coadministration with live attenuated vaccines may increase infection risk. - sirolimus Serious - Use Alternative (1)sirolimus decreases effects of hepatitis b vaccine by pharmacodynamic antagonism. Contraindicated.

Contraindicated. Immunosuppressants also increase risk of infection with concomitant live vaccines. - temsirolimus Serious - Use Alternative (1)temsirolimus decreases effects of hepatitis b vaccine by pharmacodynamic antagonism. Contraindicated. Immunosuppressants also increase risk of infection with concomitant live vaccines. - teplizumab Serious - Use Alternative (1)teplizumab decreases effects of hepatitis b vaccine by Other (see comment). Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Comment: Administer all age-appropriate vaccinations before starting teplizumab. Inactivated or mRNA vaccines are not recommended within 2 weeks before teplizumab treatment, during treatment, or 6 weeks after completion of treatment. - tocilizumab Serious - Use Alternative (1)tocilizumab decreases effects of hepatitis b vaccine by pharmacodynamic antagonism. Contraindicated. Immunosuppressants also increase risk of infection with concomitant live vaccines. - tralokinumab Monitor Closely (1)tralokinumab will decrease the level or effect of hepatitis b vaccine by immunosuppressive effects; risk of infection. Use Caution/Monitor. Limited data are available regarding coadministration with non-live vaccines. - triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension Serious - Use Alternative (1)triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension decreases effects of hepatitis b vaccine by pharmacodynamic antagonism. Contraindicated. Corticosteroids also increase risk of infection with concomitant live vaccines. - ublituximab Monitor Closely (1)ublituximab decreases effects of hepatitis b vaccine by immunosuppressive effects; risk of infection. Modify Therapy/Monitor Closely. Administer all immunizations according to immunization guidelines at least 4 weeks before initiating ublituximab for live or live-attenuated vaccines and, whenever possible, at least 2 weeks before initiating for non-live vaccines. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended during treatment and until B-cell repletion. Do not administer live or live-attenuated vaccines to infants of mothers exposed to ublituximab during pregnancy, before confirming recovery of B-cell counts as measured by CD19+ B cells. - ustekinumab Serious - Use Alternative (1)ustekinumab decreases effects of hepatitis b vaccine by pharmacodynamic antagonism. Contraindicated. Immunosuppressants also increase risk of infection with concomitant live vaccines. - voclosporin Monitor Closely (1)voclosporin decreases effects of hepatitis b vaccine by immunosuppressive effects; risk of infection. Modify Therapy/Monitor Closely. Inactivated vaccines noted to be safe for administration may not be sufficiently immunogenic during treatment. Adverse Effects Suspected adverse events after administration of any vaccine may be reported to Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), 1-800-822-7967 allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any hepatitis B vaccine or to any vaccine component, including yeast Cautions Allergic reactions reported; appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response Hepatitis B has a long incubation period; immunization may not prevent hepatitis B infection in individuals who have an unrecognized hepatitis B infection at the time of vaccine administration Pregnancy & Lactation Pregnancy There are no clinical studies of hepatitis B in pregnant women There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to Heplisav-B during pregnancy; women are encouraged to contact 1-844-443-7734 Lactation Unknown if excreted in human milk Pregnancy Categories A: Generally acceptable. Controlled studies in pregnant women show no evidence of fetal risk.B: May be acceptable. Either animal studies show no risk but human studies not available or animal studies showed minor risks and human studies done and showed no risk. C: Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks. Animal studies show risk and human studies not available or neither animal nor human studies done. D: Use in LIFE-THREATENING emergencies when no safer drug available. Positive evidence of human fetal risk. X: Do not use in pregnancy. Risks involved outweigh potential benefits. Safer alternatives exist. NA: Information not available. Pharmacology Mechanism of Action Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) which stimulates active immunity Pharmacokinetics Duration: Not established Excretion: Not established These products convey active immunity via stimulation of production of endogenously produced antibodies The onset of protection from disease is relatively slow, but duration is long lasting (years) Administration IM Administration Do not give IV or intradermal Older children, adolescents, and adults: Administer IM in deltoid muscle Neonates, infants, and small children: Administer IM in anterolateral thigh SC Administration Engerix B or Recombivax HB may be administered SC to persons at risk for hemorrhage following IM injections (eg, hemophiliacs) SC administration known to result in lower antibody response Increased incidence of local reactions, including SC nodules, observed when other aluminum-adsorbed vaccines have been administered SC Images Patient Handout Formulary Adding plans allows you to compare formulary status to other drugs in the same class.
