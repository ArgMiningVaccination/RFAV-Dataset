Participants: 166 hospitalized oncology patients, with an average age of 54 years. Results: The most commonly used CIH approach was vitamins/nutritional supplements (67%), followed by use of a special diet (42%) and manual therapies (39%). More than 40% of patients expressed interest in each of thetherapies if it was offered during their hospital stay, and 95% of patients were interested in at least one. Morethan 75% expressed interest in nutritional counseling and in massage. CIH use and interest varied somewhat bydemographic and clinical characteristics.Conclusion: Rates of CIH use among patients with cancer were high, as were their preferences to have these services available in the inpatient setting. Hospitals have the opportunity to provide patient-centered care by developing capacity to provide inpatient CIH services. Introduction An increasingly large percentage of patients with cancer use complementary and integrative health (CIH) approaches to manage unresolved symptoms of their disease or the potentially debilitating adverse effects of conventional medical treatment.1,2Recognizing patients' growing interest in these approaches, the Picker Institute and others haveidentied integrative medicine as a key component of de- livering patient-centered care.3Offering patients with cancer a choice of CIH therapies can increase their sense of em-powerment and ownership over their treatment.4Although most CIH approaches remain available only in the outpatient setting,5several recent studies have demonstrated the feasi- bility and efcacy of certain therapies for treating symptoms such as pain or anxiety in the inpatient context.6More knowledge is needed, however, regarding which specic CIHapproaches patients with cancer are most interested in receiving while hospitalized. As part of a broad initiative toimprove patient-centered care with integrative medicine, oncology inpatients at an academic medical center were surveyed. The objective was to describe their prior use of CIH approaches and current interest in receiving CIH treatmentsduring their inpatient stay. Materials and Methods Study population This study used data from a study of symptom manage- ment among inpatients, which collected participants' CIHuse and interest at baseline. Eligible study participants were hospitalized on a participating surgical oncology unit at an academic medical center with an anticipated length of stayof at least 48 hours; they spoke English and were at least 18 years old. Exclusion criteria included an unstable medical condition. The University of California, San Francisco,Committee on Human Research (institutional review board) reviewed and approved all of the study's procedures. 1Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA. 2Departments of Anesthesiology and Internal Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA. 3Division of Hospital Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA. 4Division of General Internal Medicine at San Francisco General Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.THE JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE Volume 22, Number 2, 2016, pp. 160-165\u00aaMary Prior-year use of CIH was determined by using an adapted version of a survey developed for a national study of com- plementary medicine use.7Participants were asked about use of 12 CIH approaches for health reasons: vitamins andnutritional supplements (excluding daily multivitamins); a special diet, such as the macrobiotic, Ornish, or Atkins diet; herbal remedies that are not homeopathic; remedies orpractices associated with a particular culture (e.g., Chinesemedicine, Ayurveda, or curanderismo); homeopathic reme- dies; movement therapies, such as yoga, t'ai chi ,o rqigong ; meditation, guided imagery, or progressive relaxation; chi-ropractic treatments or osteopathic manipulation; manual therapies, such as massage or acupressure; energy therapies, such as Reiki or healing touch; or acupuncture. Spirituality,religion, or prayer for health reasons was included in the survey but was excluded from analysis to be consistent with prior studies of complementary medicine. To gauge interest in hospital-based CIH, participants were asked: ''How interested would you be in receiving the following during your hospital stay?'' and prompted aboutmassage, Reiki, healing touch, acupuncture, mindfulnessmeditation, guided imagery, biofeedback, and nutritional counseling. Respondents answered on a 5-point Likert scale from ''not at all interested'' to ''very interested'' or ''don'tknow,'' indicating lack of familiarity with the therapy. The CIH approaches included in this survey were based on three criteria of having low risk, high potential benet, and fea-sibility as an inpatient service option as determined by study investigators. Dichotomous variables were created for each CIH approach, not interested (not at all interested, not veryinterested, or neutral) versus interested (somewhat interestedand very interested), with ''don't know'' responses dened as missing. Patients self-reported sociodemographic factors, such as age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Data on common symptomsexperienced by inpatients were collected, including level of pain intensity according to a 0-10 numeric rating scale and presence of nausea or vomiting. Clinical factors, includingpatient type (surgical versus nonsurgical), primary team (the hospital service primarily responsible for overall inpatient care of the patient), and length of stay, were extracted frommedical records. Analyses All analyses were performed by using Stata version 13.1 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). Descriptive statistics,including means, standard deviations, and percentages, were calculated for CIH use and CIH interest. On the basis of clinical input and prior research,2this study examined so- ciodemographic and clinical variables hypothesized to be associated with CIH use and interest. Bivariate associations were assessed by using t-tests for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables (signicance level ofp\u00a30.05). For CIH interest, analogous bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression models of descriptivecharacteristics and symptom data were performed.

The most common type of general surgery/surgical oncology (23%),gynecologic oncology (20%), and urologic (16%). The average length of stay was 8.0 days. At baseline, patients' average level of current pain was 3.3; 9% of patients reportedvomiting and 37% reported experiencing nausea. CIH use The most commonly reported CIH approach used in the prior year was vitamins/nutritional supplements (67%), followed by a special diet (42%) and manual therapies such as massage or acupressure (39%) (Table 1). The CIH ap-proaches used by less than 15% of participants were reme- dies associated with a particular culture, energy therapies, and acupuncture (data available on request). Consistent withprior studies, being non-Hispanic white and being femalewere associated with use of various CIH therapies in bi- variate analysis (Table 1). Primary team was associated with using a special diet, which was highest among patients ofthe colorectal and surgical oncology teams. CIH interest Patient-reported interest in various CIH services is presented in Table 2. For each of seven CIH approacheslisted, more than 40% of patients reported that they would be interested in that service if available, and 95% ofpatients expressed interest in at least one CIH approach. Notably, 77% of patients reported they would be inter- ested in nutritional counseling, and 76% were interestedin massage. About half of participants reported interestin acupuncture, biofeedback, and mindfulness meditation (47%-53%). Reiki or healing touch was unfamiliar to 22% of patients (data available on request). Non-Hispanicwhites were more likely to be interested in biofeedback compared with patients of other races/ethnicities, and women were more interested in Reiki and meditation(Table 2). In multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for sociodemographic, clinical, and symptom data, female sex remained a signicant factor for interestin Reiki or healing touch, mindfulness meditation, andbiofeedback (Table 3). Discussion In this sample of oncology inpatients, most (89%) had used at least one CIH approach within the past year. This ishigher than estimates among cancer survivors in prior studies, which ranged from 40% to 67%.1,8Most patients expressed a desire to receive various CIH services inthe hospital. The 2010 Complementary and Alternative Medicine Survey of Hospital s found that, in nearly 300 responding hospitals that offered one or more CIH therapy,85% cited patient demand as the reason for offering thatservice. 5The current study contributes to the knowledge base with empirical patient-reported data. Inpatients with cancer expressed substantial interest in CIH, particularly in nutritional Table 2.Interest in Hospital-Based CIH Approaches by Participant Characteristics VariableMassage (59) 50 (74)b53 (62) 48 (65)b40 (63) 50 (61) 69 (56) Race/ethnicity Non-Hispanic white 74 (62) 38 (56) 54 (64) 49 (64) 43 (65) 59 (72)b75 (61) Hispanic/Latino 27 (22) 18 (26) 17 (20) 16 (21) 12 (18) 10 (12) 28 (23) Other race/ethnicity 20 (17) 12 (18) 14 (16) 11 (14) 11 (17) 13 (16) 20 (16) Clinical characteristics Patient type Surgical 111 (88) 61 (87) 77 (88) 68 (88) 58 (87) 74 (88) 109 (86)Nonsurgical 15 (12) 9 (13) 11 (13) 9 (12) 9 (13) 10 (12) 18 (14) Primary teams Colorectal 44 (34) 20 (29) 33 (38) 26 (34) 23 (34) 29 (35) 45 (35)General surgery/surgical oncology30 (24) 17 (24) 20 (23) 20 (26) 12 (18) 18 (21) 30 (24) Gynecologic oncology 26 (21) 20 (29) 21 (24) 21 (27) 18 (27) 17 (20) 26 (20) Urologic 19 (15) 9 (13) 10 (11) 7 (9) 11 (16) 16 (19) 6 (5)Other c7 (6) 4 (6) 4 (5) 3 (4) 3 (5) 4 (5) 20 (16) Length of stay (d)a7.6-7.0 7.4 -5.8 7.5 -6.2 7.3 -5.8 8.1 -10.6 3.2 -2.4 3.2 -2.4 3.3 -2.2 Nausea/vomiting 51 (40) 30 (43) 39 (44) 32 (42) 26 (39) 32 (38) 52 (41) Unless otherwise noted, values are the number (percentage) of participants. aData in these rows presented as mean -standard deviation. bSignicant at p\u00a30.05 by descriptive characteristic. cCategory of ''other'' includes breast plastics, gynecology, medicine, otolaryngology, head and neck surgery.162 LIU ET AL.Table 3.Adjusted Odds Ratios of Interest in Hospital-Based CIH Approaches for Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics VariableAdjusted odds ratio (95% condence interval) MassageReiki or healing touch AcupunctureMindfulness meditation Guided imagery BiofeedbackNutritional counseling Sociodemographic characteristics Age 0.77 (0.36-1.62) 2.45 (0.98-6.11) Odds ratios are adjusted for all other characteristics in the table. ap\u00a30.05. bCategory of ''other'' includes urology, gynecologic oncology, breast plastics, gynecology, medicine, otolaryngology, head and neck surgery. 163counseling and massage, and t o a slightly lesser degree in acupuncture, biofeedback, and mindfulness meditation. Availability of CIH approaches in large hospital networks is increasing, including at academic medical centers, andexpertise in administration, education, and research is growing.5,9Inpatient integrative medicine is well estab- lished in Germany, where patients admitted to specializedhospitals for ''naturopathic and anthroposophic medical complex therapy'' are treated by interdisciplinary medical teams with a range of CIH approaches along with conven-tional medical care. 10In the United States, studies have found that integrative medicine as part of inpatient oncology services can signicantly decrease patients' pain use of antiemetic, anxiolytic, and hyp- notic medications compared with usual care; and may be cost saving.12Although this current cross-sectional study did not observe an association between patient symptomsand the use of CIH approaches, it was not designed to measure temporal associations between patient-reported use of CIH in the past year and current presence of symptomsduring hospitalization. Some risks of CIH approaches to cancer include possible interactions with chemotherapy or radiation or that patients may choose to forgo benecialtherapies. 13However, integrative oncology clinical practice guidelines are now available, rating the evidence for use and safety of various CIH approaches.14Most CIH services are still provided in the outpatient setting,5but evidence is mounting for the feasibility and benet of inpatient delivery. In addition, CIH is increasingly being recognized as a powerful means of improving patient-centered care. Evi-dence from this study and others indicate that a large pro- portion of patients seek to manage their own healthcare needs through CIH approaches. Integrative medicine em-phasizes patient empowerment by broadening treatment and self-care options and increasing a sense of control over the disease process. 4It focuses on the therapeutic relationship and is recommended by the Picker Institute as one of its''Practical Approaches for Building a Patient-Centered Culture.''3CIH initiatives in the German inpatient setting dene goals such as ''supporting self-healing'' and ''im-proving quality of life'' and have been shown to support health-related behavioral change.10,15Bolstering patient choice through inpatient access to CIH services has thepotential to greatly enhance a hospital's culture of healing.3 This study has several limitations. It was conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area at a hospital with an integrativemedicine outpatient clinic, where patients may be more inclined toward CIH approaches than patients at other sites. However, some evidence suggests that patients and hospitalsnationwide are using CIH. 1,5The sample consisted of pa- tients on a surgical oncology ward at a university hospital; however, because of overflow and hospital space needs, a small percentage of patients ( <5%) on the ward did not have cancer. The small proportion of patients reporting use of culturally specic remedies may be due to the fact that our sample was largely non-Hispanic white. Finally, how CIH isdened and inclusion or exclusion of certain approaches greatly affects estimates of usage prevalence. For instance, by some denitions, vitamins or nutritional approaches maynot be considered part of CIH. These approaches were in- cluded to maintain consistency with categories used by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.In conclusion, despite its limitations, this study provides preliminary evidence of prevalent past-year CIH use among inpatients with cancer before hospitalization, and of their greatinterest in receiving integrative services in the hospital. Furtherresearch to evaluate how to bring safe and effective integrative healthcare into the wards is warranted. An important area of consideration is that of access; insurance coverage and pro-vider reimbursement for many of these therapies remain a challenge. 9Ultimately, incorporating evidence-based CIH treatments into inpatient care could broaden therapeuticoptions in a way that is feasible for hospitals, acceptable to providers, and responsive to patient preference.
