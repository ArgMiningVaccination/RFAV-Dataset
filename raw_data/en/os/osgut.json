Licensed experts use extremely fine, sterilized, and disposable needles to ensure safety and to give you the most possible benefits. Acupuncture treatment is available at Lee Health's Healthy Life Center Coconut Point, Monday - Friday 8 AM - 4:30 PM, no referral is needed for a visit just call us at 239-468-0050. What happens at my appointment? Ashley Donato, AP, L.Ac., Dipl.O.M., M.S., is a board certified acupuncture physician that will administer your acupuncture. This is similar to a procedural visit: - Patients fill out paperwork about their health history, the reason for their visit, and other relevant questions. - An expert will talk to you, observe your condition, take your pulse and other vitals to come up with the correct treatment plan. - You will lie down comfortably on a treatment table and Dr. Donato will gently insert sterilized acupuncture needles into precise areas of your body. Patients usually rest for a minimum of thirty minutes to allow the body to correct its imbalances. - When the needles are removed, the visit is over and you will be counseled on your follow up or treatment plan. The patient will generally feel relaxed and at ease. What does acupuncture help treat? We're glad you asked. Acupuncture is best known for pain management, cancer symptom management, behavioral health, and geriatric health. In addition to these symptoms: - Pain - Sciatica - Pre/Post Surgery - Migraines - Inflammation - Osteoarthritis - Autoimmune Diseases - PMS - Hot Flashes - Gastrointestinal Issues - Acid Reflux - Sinusitis - Insomnia - Anxiety/Depression - Fatigue Does it hurt? Acupuncture does not hurt. The needle creates a micro tear, sending a signal to the brain, where chemical messengers release and naturally improve your health. Some patients may feel a slight tingle, and many are surprised by how relaxed they feel. How many needles are used? The number of needles varies based on your condition, but typically we use somewhere between eight and sixteen each visit. And remember: Acupuncture needles are NOT the same as needles used to poke you and draw blood. These are much finer and thinner. Are the needles reused? No. Acupuncture needles are either individually wrapped or sealed in a sterile pack. The FDA regulates these needles, which are discarded after use. Are there different types or styles? Not all acupuncturists study the same style. Typically, most schools teach Traditional Chinese Medicine, but there are many different forms: Five-element theory, esoteric, Japanese, Korean, Tan style, Master Tang Theory, and others. What style will work best for you? We can help you decide. How does acupuncture work? Let's use pain as an example. Something causes your pain. Acupuncturists look to balance that system to stop the pain. The placement of the needle and the metal in the needle itself can be thought of as medicine. The practitioner wisely chooses the correct needle placement, just like the medical doctor chooses the correct medication. The needle sends a signal through a neural pathway to stimulate oxygen, nutrients, blood, and chemical messengers to improve your cellular, tissue, organ, and bone health.
