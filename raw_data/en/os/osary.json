This sweet, fruity blend can be enjoyed both hot and iced. In Scandinavia, the climate is often extreme. Yet Scandinavians love to spend time outdoors and live in harmony with the environment and the surrounding nature. They've learnt to understand and draw on their inner strengths to deal with the harsh exterior. This is why our Scandinavian DETOX supports the body's natural defences, by harnessing the qualities of the plants and fruit of Nordic forests, such as birch and berries. This herbal tea is made up of: - birch: symbol of renewal in Nordic culture and known for its high flavonoid content with antioxidant properties, it contains diuretic and cleansing agents that help the body eliminate toxins. - sea buckthorn, cranberry, elderflower, blueberry: this blend of wild berries with antioxidant properties and rich in vitamins provides natural support for the body's defence mechanisms. Especially rich in vitamin C, these berries contribute to the body's effective natural defences and help revitalise the body, to stay healthy through the seasons.
