Unfortunately, pest control can't be effectively performed without chemicals. However, where possible we always choose lower toxicity products, and careful application to reduce our environmental impact. There's no need to be applying excessive amounts of chemicals to areas that don't have issues. Rather focusing more specifically on what it is you're actually treating so you're not treating everything under the sun. By considering an eco-friendly pest control option you are making a conscious effort to minimize your impact on the environment. Not only are our low toxicity products just as effective as the higher toxicity chemicals, but they are less likely to harm the environment, your family or your pets. It is a small step that you can make in the right direction for our planet. Many supermarket shelf products and other pest control poisons have very high levels of toxic additives in addition to the active ingredients that control the target pest. Although completely non-toxic pest control is considered to have very low to no control impact on pests, we do use lower toxicity products than the average supermarket. We achieve this by being able to use just one very specialised chemical diluted at a specific rate that does the job, but doesn't have the additional toxic additives of many readily available pest control products. While chemical free pest control is sadly not possible for effective pest treatments, our environmentally friendly pest control method leverage our deep knowledge and understanding of the pests we target and the wider insect populations, to allow us to minimise the impact to helpful insects and creatures in your gardens and soil. By understanding the biology and behaviour of the pests we are targeting we are able to carefully target treatment areas and keep children and pets safe while preserving the natural balance of insect life for our future.
