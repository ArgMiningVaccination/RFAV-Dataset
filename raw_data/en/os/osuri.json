Traditional Chinese Medicine treats a variety of diseases. A skilled TCM practitioner will use the following modalities to bring their patient into balance: - Meditation - allows the individual to recognize imbalance and naturally correct it before it leads to disease. Modern research continues to support the use of meditation as therapy. - Exercise / Lifestyle - The healthy movement or Qi (or energy) and the use of this energy throughout our lives is an important consideration in TCM. A TCM practitioner will discuss the daily activities which best cultivate wellness for each unique individual. - Traditional Food Cures / Dietary Therapy - Food is medicine!
