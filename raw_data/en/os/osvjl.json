Updates will be effective on the first day of the month. During the policy year, the following types of changes may be made: Removal of a drug or dosage form of a drug from the Formulary; A change in tier placement of a drug that results in an increase or decrease in cost sharing; and Adding or changing utilization management procedures applicable to a drug. How to Use This Document This Formulary provides a list of the approved prescription medications covered under your Grandfathered POS Health Insurance Plan including both generic and brand name drugs. This document applies only to prescribed outpatient prescription drugs obtained through a retail pharmacy within the MedImpact network. This document does not apply to medications administered in the doctor's office or in the hospital which are covered under your medical benefit. For information on drugs covered under your medical benefit, please see the General Benefits section of your Certificate of Insurance . The Formulary may be accessed using either the categorical list of drugs or the alphabetical index. The categorical list of drugs in this Formulary groups drugs into drug categories and class based on the First National Databank (FDB), a widely-accepted independent drug classification system. A prescription drug may be located by looking up the therapeutic category and class to which the drug belongs or the brand or generic name of the drug in the alphabetical index. A drug is listed a lphabetically by the brand and generic name in the therapeutic category and class to which it belongs. The generic name for a brand name drug is included after the brand name in parentheses and all lowercase italicized letters. If a generic equivalent for a brand name drug is both available and covered, the generic drug will be listed separately from the brand name drug in all lowercase italicized letters. If a generic drug is marketed under a proprietary, trademark protected brand name, the brand name will be listed after the generic name in parentheses and regular typeface with the first letter of each word capitalized. If a generic equivalent for a brand name drug is not available on the market or is not covered, the drug will not be separately listed by its generic name. EXAMPLE of how drugs are listed on the Formulary: Brand name drug. The brand name antibiotic drug \"Moxatag\" would be listed as follows: Under the Prescription Drug Name Column, therapeutic category \"ANTI -INFECTIVE AGENTS\", drug class \"AMINOPENICILLIAN ANTIBIOTIC - ANTIBIOTICS\", the prescription brand name drug is listed in all capital letters,\" MOXATAG\" followed by the generic equivalent of the drug shown in parenthesis, all lower case italicized \"(amoxicillin) \". ANTI-INFECTIVE AGENTS - DRUGS FOR INFECTIONS AMINOPENICILLIAN ANTIBIOTIC - ANTIBIOTICS MOXATAG ORAL TABLET, ER MULITPHASE 24 HR 775 MG (amoxicillin) 3 Generic drug. The generic antibiotic drug \"amoxicillin\" would be listed as follows: Under the therapeutic category \"ANTI -INFECTIVE AGENTS\", drug class \"AMINOPENICILLIAN ANTIBIOTIC - ANTIBIOTICS\", the prescription generic drug is listed in lower case italics \" amoxicillin\". ANTI-INFECTIVE AGENTS - DRUGS FOR INFECTIONS AMINOPENICILLIAN ANTIBIOTIC - ANTIBIOTICS amoxicillin oral capsule 250 mg, 500 mg 1 KPIC POS GF Drug Tiers Tier Benefit Design The Formulary applies to a tier benefit design, where the insured shares the cost of prescription drug therapy based on the drug's tier and copay or coinsurance. In most instances, generically available drugs will be covered in a separate lower tier (lower copay), and branded drugs listed on the Formulary will be covered under a hi gher tier (higher copay). Under your POS Plan, you will pay a different copay or coinsurance for preferred brand drugs and non -preferred brand drugs. Preferred drugs cost you less than non -preferred drugs. Please refer to the Tier Definition table below t o see how to identify which drugs are preferred or non -preferred drugs. If you request a brand -name drug when a generic drug is prescribed, you may be responsible for paying the brand - name copay plus the difference in cost between the generic drug and the brand -name drug. Please see your Certificate of Insurance for details. For all drugs within the Drug Formulary table, the tier level is denoted throughout the document using the following symbols ( refer to table below ). Tier Definition: Symbol Guideline Description T1 Tier 1 Preferred Generic Drugs T2 Tier 2 Preferred Brand Name Drugs T3 Tier 3 Non-Preferred Generic and Brand Name Drugs PV Preventive Drugs Preventive -care benefits required under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). (Preventive Drugs covered at no cost if your group elected to include ACA preventive -care benefits under their grandfathered plan.) Tobacco cessation drugs listed on this formulary are covered at no cost on all plans. DME Other Pharmacy Items Other pharmacy items and certain DME, such as test strips and lancets, available at the pharmacy and through your medical benefit. Maintaining and Updating the Formulary The MedImpact Healthcare Systems Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) and Formulary Committees provide physicians and pharmacists with a method to evaluate the safety, efficacy and competitive prices for commercially available drug products. The MedImpact P&T and Formulary Committees meet quarterly and more often as warranted to ensure clinical relevancy of the Formulary. The Formulary is updated by the MedImpact P&T and Formulary Committees using a structured approach to the drug selection process to ensure continuing patient access to rational drug therapies. The MedImpact P&T and Formulary Committees use the following criteria in the evaluation o f drug selection for the Formulary: Drug safety profile Drug efficacy Comparison of relevant therapeutic benefits to current Formulary agents of similar use, and to minimize therapeutic duplication where possible Lower costs relative to comparable therapies KPIC POS GF What medications are covered? Your prescription drug benefit will generally cover prescribed generic and brand -name drugs listed on the Formulary if the drug is medically necessary, the prescription is filled by a MedImpact network pharmacy provider, and other coverage rules are followed. Over -the-counter (OTC) medications are not generally covered, however, certain preventive OTC medications are covered when prescribed by a physician, such as over the counter FDA -approved female contraceptiv es, and some Durable Medical Equipment prescribed by a physician to treat diabetes, and inhaler spacers to assist with inhalation devices are also covered. The Formulary lists the pharmacy benefits covered under your outpatient prescription drug benefit a nd obtained from a MedImpact network participating retail pharmacy. This Formulary does not apply to drugs and devices that are obtained through the medical benefit portion of your coverage: for example, medications provided or administered in the doctor's office or in the hospital or, unless specifically stated otherwise, devices covered under the Durable Medical Equipment benefit that are obtained at the doctor's office or through a Durable Medical Equipment vendor. Diabetes medication and equipment. Your outpatient prescription drug coverage includes the following prescription items for the management and treatment of diabetes: Insulin Needles and syringes for injecting insulin Prescriptive medications for the treatment of diabetes Glucagon Other pharmacy items. Some Durable Medical Equipment that is covered through your medical benefit is also available at the pharmacy: disposable blood glucose and ketone urine test strips; blood glucose monitors; lancets and lancet puncture devices; pen d elivery systems for the administration of insulin; visual aids excluding eyewear to assist in insulin dosing; and peak flow meters. Contraceptives. Your outpatient prescription drug coverage includes all prescribed FDA -approved contraceptive drugs, including over the counter FDA -approved female contraceptive methods when prescribed by a licensed health care professional authorized to prescribe drugs. All such medications require a prescription from your doctor. Elective coverage of preventive drugs at no cost. If your plan covers preventive drugs at no cost (because your group elected to include preventive -care benefits required under the Affordable Care Act in their grandfathered plan), then the drugs identified in the Formulary with the \"PV\" symbol are covered at no cost share regardless of the drug tier indicated on the Formulary. A ll such medications require a prescription from your doctor. Additionally, some medications are only covered at no cost for patients who meet the criteria listed in the Formulary. Note: The presence of a prescription drug on the Formulary does not guarant ee that you will be prescribed that prescription drug by your prescribing provider for a particular medical condition. Note: The total cost share for covered prescribed orally administered anti -cancer drugs shall not exceed $200 for a 30 - day supply. KPIC POS GF What drugs are not covered? Self-administered injectable drugs. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications or their equivalents, except for those OTC medications included in this Formulary. Any drug product used for cosmetic purposes. Experimental drug products or any drug product used in an experimental manner. Refer to your Certificate of Insurance for additional information. Replacement of lost or stolen medication. Medications administered by a clinician unless otherwise specified in the Formulary listing. Foreign-sourced drugs or drugs not approved by the United States Food & Drug Administration, except in certain cases of drug shortage, when allowed under the individual's pharmacy benefit. Weight loss drugs Sexual dysfun ction drugs Non-formulary drugs Non-formulary drugs are covered when medically necessary. How do I request an exception for a drug that is not on the Formulary? You, your designee, or your prescribing provider can request an exception to obtain coverage of a drug that is not on the Formulary by calling MedImpact at 1-800-788-2949. Upon receipt of your exception request, MedImpact will notify you within 72 hours for n on-urgent requests and within 24 hours if urgent circumstances exist, of the request approval or other outcome. (Urgent circumstances exist when an insured is suffering from a health condition that may seriously jeopardize the insured's life, health or abi lity to regain maximum function or when you are using a drug while undergoing a current course of treatment.) If a standard exception request is granted, coverage of the non - formulary drug will be granted for the duration of the prescription, including ref ills. If an exception based on urgent circumstances is granted, coverage of the non -formulary drug will be granted for the duration of the urgency. You may appeal the denial of an exception request. Please refer to your Certificate of Insurance for more in formation on appeal rights and procedures. Are there any restrictions on the drugs covered on the Formulary? Yes, for certain agents with the Formulary, a recommended prescribing guideline may apply. These are denoted throughout the document using the fol lowing symbols ( refer to table below ). Guideline Symbol Table: Symbol Guidelines Description AGE Age Edit Coverage depends on patient age. PA Prior Authorization Requires a prior authorization based on specific clinical criteria. See \"What is a Prior Authorization? \" below for additional information. QL Quantity Limit Coverage is limited to specific quantities per prescription and/or time period. Prior authorization is required for quantities exceeding the restriction. ST Step Therapy Coverage depends on previous use of another drug. Prior authorization may be required. See \"What is Step Therapy? \" below for additional information. KP Covered by KP Pharmacy Covered under the HMO level of your POS plan through the KP pharmacy under a separate drug formulary (see kp.org/formulary) KPIC POS GF What is a Prior Authorization? A prior authorization (\"PA\") is a technique that is used to encourage safe and competitively priced medication use. Many drugs have multiple indications, so PAs are placed on drugs to make sure the drug is appropriate and safe for the insured. How does the program work? Drugs marked with a PA mean that your prescriber must first show that you have a medically necessary need for that particular drug. This means that t o receive coverage your prescriber will need to work with MedImpact to receive pre -approval of the drug. Prior authorized drugs have specific clinical criteria that you must meet in order to obtain coverage. Refer to Requirements / Limits column in the Fo rmulary for drugs that require a PA. Upon receipt of your prior authorization request, MedImpact will notify the licensed prescribing provider within 72 hours for non -urgent requests and within 24 hours if urgent circumstances exist of the request approva l or other outcome. If MedImpact fails to respond within 72 hours for non -urgent requests and within 24 hours if urgent circumstances exist from receipt of a request form from a licensed prescribing provider, the request shall be deemed to have been approv ed. If you are not satisfied with the outcome, you can request a waiver by calling MedImpact at 1- 800- 788-2949. What are Quantity Limits? Coverage for certain drugs may be limited to specific quantities per prescription and/or time period. Prior authoriz ation is required for quantities exceeding the quantity limit guideline. What is Step Therapy? Selected prescription drugs require step therapy. The step therapy program encourages safe and competitively priced medication use. Under this program, a \"step\" approach is required to receive coverage for certain high -cost medications. This means that to receive coverage you may need to first try a proven, lower cost medication before using a more costly treatment. How does the program work? The step ther apy program requires that you have a prescription history for a \"first - line\" medication before your benefit plan will cover a \"second -line\" medication. A first -line medication is recognized as safe and effective in treating a specific medical condition, as well as keeping costs down. A second -line medication is a less- preferred or sometimes more costly treatment option. Refer to Step Therapy Edits in the Index section at the end of the Formulary for a complete list of medications requiring step therapy and their criteria. When possible, your doctor should prescribe a first -line medication appropriate for your condition. If your doctor determines that a first -line drug is not appropriate for you or is not effective for you, your prescription drug benefit wi ll cover a second -line drug when certain conditions are met. Prior authorization may be required. Upon receipt of your request for a second -line drug, MedImpact will notify the licensed prescribing provider within 72 hours for non -urgent requests and withi n 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist of the request approval or other outcome. If you are not satisfied with the outcome, you can request a waiver by calling MedImpact at 1-800-788-2949. Note: If you have transitioned from a prior health insurance co verage to a new KPIC health insurance policy, any prescription drug that is currently being prescribed and considered safe and effective to treat a medical condition may not be subject to step therapy if, under your prior coverage: 1) The drug was not previou sly subject to step therapy; or 2) Step therapy was already obtained. This does not apply if MedImpact's P&T Committee and/or your provider determines that such drug is no longer safe or effective to treat your medical condition. Prior authorization may be required for the continued coverage of a prescription drug prescribed pursuant to step therapy imposed under your prior coverage, and the prescribing provider is not precluded from prescribing another drug covered by the new policy tha t is medically appropriate for your condition.

Your insurance company pays the rest. \"Drug Tier\" means a group of prescription drugs that correspond to a specified cost sharing tier in your health insurance policy. The drug tier in which a prescription drug is placed determines your portion of the cost for the drug. \"Exception request\" means a request for coverage of a non -formulary drug. If you, you r designee, or your prescribing health care provider submits a request for coverage of a non -formulary drug, your insurer must cover the non-formulary drug when it is medically necessary for you to take the drug. \"Exigent circumstances \" means when you are suffering from a medical condition that may seriously jeopardize your life, health, or ability to regain maximum function, or when you are undergoing a current course of treatment using a non -formulary drug. \"Formulary\" or \"prescription drug list\" means the list of drugs that is covered by your health insurance policy under the prescription drug benefit of the policy.

A generic drug is listed in this Formulary in italicized lowercase letters. \"Medically Necessary\" means health care benefits needed to diagnose, treat, or prevent a medical condition or its symptoms and that meet accepted standards of medicine. Health insurance usually does not cover health care benefits that are not medically necessary.

Out -of-pocket costs include deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance for covered health care benefits, plus all costs for health care benefits that are not covered. \"Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs\" are medicines sold directly to a consumer without requiring a prescription from a healthcare professional. For purposes of this Formulary, OTC drugs that are covered under your outpatient prescription drug benefit require a prescr iption from your doctor \"Prescribing provider\" means a health care provider who can write a prescription for a drug to diagnose, treat, or prevent a medical condition. \"Prescription\" means an oral, written, or electronic order from a prescribing provider authorizing a prescription drug to be provided to a specific individual. \"Prescription drug\" means a drug that by law requires a prescription. \"Prior Authorization\" means a decision by your health insurer that a health care benefit is medically necessar y for you. If a prescription drug is subject to prior authorization in this Formulary, your prescribing provider must request approval from your health insurer to cover the drug before you fill your prescription. Your health insurer must grant a prior auth orization request when it is medically necessary for you to take the drug. \"Step therapy\" means a specific sequence in which prescription drugs for a particular medical condition must be tried. If a drug is subject to step therapy in this Formulary, you m ay have to try one or more other drugs before your health insurance policy will cover that drug for your medical condition.
