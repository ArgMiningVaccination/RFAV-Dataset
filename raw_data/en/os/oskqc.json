No caffeine, no spices. I could eat as much as I wanted, whatever fruit I wanted to. It's supposed to cleanse your body. If it is healthy to do that, how often can you do it without throwing your body off balance? - Sara C., Riverside Lots of popular diets promise to cleanse your body of impurities. Doing so will help you shed pounds, boost your energy and help fight colon cancer, proponents say. On the upside, such detoxification diets tend to call for only a few days of vigilance. Which may be a good thing because if you comb for evidence of their benefits, the list is awfully short and the drawbacks are longer. Cleansing diets come in many packages, some commercially produced and others consisting of a mixture of items easily found in a grocery store. One of the most popular among the Hollywood set involves lemon juice, cayenne pepper, maple syrup and water (the appropriately named \"master cleanse\"). Purging the body of harmful elements is an idea as old as religion itself. A practice dating back to ancient India, known as Ayurvedic medicine, remains popular, with 200,000 Americans who consider themselves followers. The root word, \"Ayurveda,\" translates from Sanskrit to \"science of life\" - a term that underscores the medical system's holistic approach. At its core, Ayurvedic medicine emphasizes cleansing the body of substances that cause disease, namely by jettisoning what it calls \"ama,\" or undigested food that impedes normal respiratory and digestive function. To accomplish this, adherents are known to use enemas, massage and oils. Fruit works as well, supposedly. Here's one itinerary gleaned from the Internet: Drink an herbal tea laxative the night before you begin your diet. For the next few days, load up on fruit. (At least two grapefruits, six oranges and three lemons a day are recommended.) Also, consume lots of water and organic fruit juice. Some people say they feel energized during and after a detox. Could this be the placebo effect at work? Probably, says the Mayo Clinic's consumer website. \"There's little evidence that detox diets actually remove toxins from the body. Most ingested toxins are efficiently and effectively removed by the kidneys and liver and excreted in urine and stool,\" Mayo nutritionist Katherine Zeratsky explains. People also should consider the side effects, which may include dehydration, nausea, dizziness and fatigue, she adds. Researchers haven't been very interested in studying the subject, so there isn't much data for or against cleansing diets. On the pro side, the most rigorous (if you want to call it that) study was a 2008 report authored by an Ohio chiropractor, who examined 28 patients on a fruit and veggie diet. After 21 days, the participants lowered their bad cholesterol and triglycerides and lost an average of 9 pounds. But with such a small sample, it's difficult to draw any firm conclusions from the report. Overall diagnosis: A balanced diet with fruits and other healthy foods, including whole grains and proteins, is a better way to go. "}
