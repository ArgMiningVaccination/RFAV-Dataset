Some people are finding they're having reactions like hives, but they still want to make sure they're protected against the virus. Dr. S. Shahzad Mustafa, the lead allergy physician at RRH, says giving five low doses of the COVID-19 vaccine about 15 to 20 minutes apart to patients who are allergic induces the patient's tolerance. It's good news for people like Meaghan de Chateauvieux who had an allergic reaction after getting her first dose. \"I was committed to both doses and I think I'm very grateful that there was an opportunity to do so and to be able to have that second dose and have that protection against COVID, but also have that ability to protect others in building up herd immunity,\" she said. \"I think the most important thing like everything in medicine is the history. Like any fevers, delayed rashes, muscle aches, these are almost expected with vaccines and not allergic reactions. But you're being monitored for 15 minutes, most people after their vaccine, and most allergic reactions happen within that time frame. So itchy rashes, swelling, difficulty breathing, passing out within that time frame, needs to be evaluated,\" Dr. Mustafa said. Dr. Mustafa says if you are concerned you might have a reaction, you should contact your doctor or allergist. "}
