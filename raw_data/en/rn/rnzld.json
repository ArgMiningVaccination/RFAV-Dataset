The report is divided into seven chapters reporting on the key areas outlined in the Chapter 7: Participation.

The development (MDGs) and SPPRED goals. The MDG country- of a participatory process in the implementation specific goals, targets, and indicators, are the phase has received a lot of attention from the subject of on-going discussions.

The information is based on the implementation progress reports received from the line ministries in these sectors. Chapter 4 reports on those sectors relating to social policy and human capital developme nt. Progress in the implementation of policy measures and activities in education, culture, health, social protection, and improving the living standards of IDPs and refugees is set out in this chapter . Chapter 5 is devoted to regional policy and infrastructure development.

In the same way , it is considered themselves to the Millennium Development important that the country-specific MDGs and Goals (MDGs) to achieve poverty reduction and targets should be nationally owned, and that they promote human development in the world. The could therefore benefit from being \"embedded\" in number of countries giving their commitment has the SPPRED participatory process. since risen to 191.

While there are general guidelines on world community to achieve measurable the content and approach required for a PRSP , it improvements in people's lives by the year 2015. is recognised that there is no single recipe for The full MDG framework comprises 8 goals, 18 each country , and that each PRSP will have to targets and 48 indicators. Most targets are to be take into account the specific economic achieved over a 25-year period, from 1990 to conditions, problems, institutions, social capital 2015. The 8 main goals are as follows: etc of the specific country . Azerbaijan has already gone through a major part of the process !Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger of adapting the PRSP guidelines to its specific !Achieve universal primary education conditions. In the same way , the global MDGs !Promote gender equality and empower have to be adapted to local conditions, and made women \"country-specific\". But this process could be !Reduce child mortality accelerated by building on the groundwork done !Improve maternal health in the SPPRED formulation phase. !Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases One of the principles of SPPRED is that it is not !Ensure environmental sustainability an abstract \"wish list\" of good intentions, but is !Develop a global partnership for linked to the actual expenditure capabilities and development potential of the country . For this reason, the strategy includes a Medium-T erm Expenditure These MDGs (as well as the 18 targets) are set at Framework (MTEF). This is also one of the the global level, and cannot be considered principles of the MDGs; i.e country-specific goals appropriate for all countries. Azerbaijan, like the and targets should be backed up by a clear other nations who signed the Millennium expenditure programme, which makes their Declaration, now has the task of adapting them achievement realistic. to its concrete conditions and stage of development and of setting country-specific The WB and the UNDP have recently issued a goals and targets. Initial discussion of possible joint statement, which sets out the desire of both country-specific goals has taken place in 2003 organisations to see PRSPs and country- within the framework of the SPPRED's activities. specific MDGs being integrated, since PRSPs The reasons for this are as follows: are seen as ideal vehicles through which to mobilise the country's resources to achieve the The overall aim of the MDGs and that of MDGs. The ADB, which since 1999 has made SPPRED is poverty reduction, and the overall poverty reduction its overarching aim, supports goals identified by SPPRED are fully compatible the development of national poverty reduction with the MDGs. Moreover , SPPRED sets out a strategies and in Azerbaijan has provided series of priority policy directions and measures support to the Government in the formulation and which can be used by the government to achieve implementation of SPPRED. In 2002 the ADB these goals. also adopted the MDGs as the principle targets for poverty reduction. Thus SPPRED has so far SPPRED as a strategy is \"nationally owned\", i.e. provided an excellent example of donor it is a poverty reduction strategy developed not coordination between IFIs and also other by any individual donor organisation, but by the members of the donor community .

A new absolute poverty line has been of the formulation period as well as the first prepared by the relevant SWG and this will be experiences of implementation could be taken as used to set the 2002 baseline. a basis for developing longer term goals and targets for poverty reduction, and for country It is expedient that the second global MDG of specific MDGs. achieving universal primary education be replaced by the country-specific goal of During the period reported here (2003), achieving universal secondary education. Within preliminary discussions have been underway this it is recognized that this only makes sense as within the SPPRED Secretariat and line a country goal if it is accompanied by the ministries on the most appropriate MDGs for measures envisaged in SPPRED to improve the Azerbaijan. There has also been discussion of quality of and access to basic school education, these at the Regional W orkshops held and to ensure that curriculum reflects both the throughout the country (see chapter 7 for changing skill requirements of the new labor details). The table in Appendix 1 gives a market and training in basic life skills. For summary of the country discussion so far , and monitoring purposes, it will be necessary to look some conclusions are reported in the relevant not only at enrolment rates, but also actual chapters in this report. Here we highlight just attendance rates. several key points: While goal three (promoting gender equality and SPPRED has so far identified its overall goals for empowering women) is considered important for poverty reduction and the next stage is to set Azerbaijan, the targets and indicators require concrete targets and indicators for these goals. further discussion. There will be less emphasis In the formulation period, it was found that for on literacy and quality of opportunity at the lower most goals, the statistical basis for setting levels of education, but more on encouraging benchmarks and monitoring progress in women to take on higher education that could achieving targets is still weak; and more time was create an opportunity for them to aim for top needed for discussion of targets. However , positions in economic and political life. setting concrete targets and indicators is a task which the Secretariat is currently working on, While goals four and five (reducing child and parallel to its work in building up the statistical maternal mortality) are considered appropriate base and capacity in the country . The concrete for Azerbaijan, the main problem encountered is targets for both SPPRED and the country- the discrepancy between official data (based on specific MDGs will be developed together administrative sources) and survey estimates for through dialogue with the relevant stakeholders, these indicators. With regard to Goal 6 SWGs and local experts in the coming period. (combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases), the goal is also considered One clear conclusion is that 1990 cannot be appropriate, and discussion is taking place on taken as a baseline for most country specific the targets and indicators. targets, partly due to lack of data, and sometimes due to the fact that it is considered inappropriate Goal seven (ensure environmental sustaina - because it precedes a lot of the social collapse bility) is considered very relevant to Azerbaijan associated with the first years of the transition and is an integral part of SPPRED. However , period. Thus use of 1990 would lead to an initial discussion of targets and indicators has underestimation of the achievements of the shown that targets regarding land areas covered country in overcoming the dif ficulties and drop in by forest or guaranteed protection to maintain value of most social indicators in the 1990s, and biological diversity will have to be set in a 10sensitive manner , and involving local communities in the discussion. This is partly due to the need to ensure that the poor are not deprived of access to land and energy supply (firewood) in situations where supply of alternative energy sources cannot be guaranteed at af fordable prices. Setting a target for access to safe drinking water is considered appropriate for Azerbaijan, but this will require an improvement of the monitoring system, and also more work on clarifying the definition of \"improved water source\" to be used in the country . At present administrative statistics are available only on access to piped water , but there is no consistent monitoring of the quality of the water which is delivered through the pipes . For Azerbaijan it may be appropriate to set a target for increasing access to piped water in rural areas, and also to set indicators which rely on monitoring of the quality of the water being delivered to households. The latter will require improvements in the current monitoring system (as envisaged by SPPRED; see policy measure under health). The global MDGs include a target aimed at improving the lives of slum dwellers. This concept is considered dif ficult to define and monitor in Azerbaijan. However , it may be appropriate for Azerbaijan to set a target, possibly for 2010 rather than 2015, aimed at ensuring that all IDPs are re-settled from accommodation with access to sanitation. The final MDG (developing a global partnership for development) requires more country discussion, but a first proposal has been put forward to adapt this for Azerbaijan to a country- specific goal of \"increasing FDI in the non-oil sector\". This is completely compatible with SPPRED's key strategic aims of creating an enabling environment for income-generating opportunities, and of promoting economic development outside the oil sector and outside of the Absheron peninsula. The country discussion of MDGs will continue in 2004, and targets will be developed as SPPRED also goes on to develop specific targets. In line with the recommendations made in the Joint Statement by the WB and UN on the relationship between MDGs and PRSPs (April 2003), this report should be considered as both an annual SPPRED report and the country MDG report. 11One of the tasks of the SPPRED Secretariat is to first two tasks are seen as a precondition for the coordinate work on monitoring trends in living implementation of all the poverty reduction standards in the country , using a variety of living measures envisaged in SPPRED; the last two standards indicators.

See SPPRED, Appendix 3.5 The Poverty Monitoring Group has decided that the relative poverty line will be set at 70% of the median per capita consumption expenditure level, whereas it was set at 60% for the 2001 results. It is intended to use 70% in the future for monitoring purposes.Table 2.3.

The average reported monthly wage was 21.4% higher in nominal terms (22.2% in real terms) in 2003 than in 2002. The minimum wage was increased from 27500 to 60000 manat in January 2004, leading to wage increases in the public sector and increases in social benefits linked to the minimum wage.

The number of people employed in the public sector has decreased by approximately 2.1 times since 1990, and was 1.192 mln. in 2002. At the same time, the numbers employed in the non-state sector has increased by 2.3 times and was 2.535 mln. in 2002. Annual growth rates for public and private sectors show that the decrease in employment in the public sector has been greater than the increase in the private sector since 1998 (see Figure 2.2) which suggests either an increase in unregistered unemployment, or an increase in informal employment. Due to the relatively favourable age structure of the population, reflecting the high fertility rates in the past, decline in death rates, and an increase in life expectancy , the number of working age population in Azerbaijan increased from 3.973 mln. in 1990 to 4.988 mln. in 2002, or by 25%. In the coming years, the greater number of new labour market entrants will have a significant impact on labour supply . This growth in the young entrants especially reflects high birth rates in the 1980s. Data on the employed and unemployed population have until now been derived from administrative sources which cannot provide a full picture of the economically active and inactive population in the country; they do not cover all the working population and cannot capture persons withou t work who are not registered with employment offices. For example, according to state statistics there were 50,963 unemployed persons of ficially registered at the employment of fices in 2002, which is only 1.4 percent of the total economically active population. However , for the first time the results of the new (2003) LFS can be used to give more realistic estimates. The results suggest that the labour force 7 participation rate (LFPR) for the population age 15 years and over was 62.9%, (75.6% for men and 51,1% for women). By international standards this can be considered a high LFPR. These results are consistent with those calculated on the basis of the 1999 population census, which showed that the LFRP was 64.6%, (73% for men and 57.2% for 8 women) . The slight decrease in the LFPR can be explained by the higher inactivity rate for women in Figure 2.3. 7 Labour force participation rate is calculated by expressing the number of persons in the labour force as a percentage of the population 15 and over .8 Labour market developments in Azerbaijan, A.Kuddo ECSHD 2025,618,62,822,4 -22,6-15,6-21,5-4,8-3-3,9 46,2 -50 -30 -10 10 30 501990-19951995-19981998-19991999-20002000-20012001-2002 Public sector Private sector The labour force participation rate also varies 56.2%, which means that almost half of the by urban and rural areas.

The highest unemployment rate was 23.8% among youth in the 20-24 age group. Figure 2.5 suggests that the unemployment rate among 20-24 age groups with all education level is higher than for any other age category . The highest unemployment rate was 53.6%at the 20- 24 years with incomplete high education. The second highest unemployment rate was observed for the 20-29 years age group with high education. The unemployment rate for the 20-29 year old age group with higher education (26%) suggests that graduates from that age group are particularly af fected by the mismatch between qualifications and the skills in demand in the labour market. 2.4 Education Background Azerbaijan has long shown an awareness of the need to invest in and maintain its human capital , and in particular the value of having a well- educated population. The results of the population censuses, which have been carried out every ten years since 1939, show that there has been a steady increase in the literacy rate, and the latest census data (from 1999) show that the literacy rate for the country is 99%. It is estimated that 97% of the adult population have completed (at minimum) primary school education. There are no significant gender differences in literacy rates and completion of primary education. The links between education and poverty are well documented. A better-educated population is inter alia more able to find employment, and is more likely to bring up a healthy young generation. The results of the latest HBS (2002; see charter 2) confirm that the higher the level of education of the head of the household, the lower the probability that the household will be poor. However , the SPPRED document has pointed out that, despite its impressive educational achievements, Azerbaijan is currently facing serious problems in maintaining the quality of its education system, and in adapting it to the demands of a transition economy . There are signs that the younger generations are not investing in their education, that it is not being looked upon as a tool to defend them from poverty; i.e. the returns to education are not considered worth the investment required to go beyond the compulsory stages of education. There is a danger that this will lead to a certain decline in the country's human capital. The SPPRED document states clearly that one of the main strategic aims of the country is to maintain the good education indicators inherited from the Soviet period, while also re-orientating the country's education system to the needs of a market economy . One of the six key strategic aims of SPPRED is \"to improve the quality and equality of access to basic health and education services\". Within the education sector , SPPRED stipulates 12 policy directions aimed at both improving the quality of education and equal ity of access. SPPRED also envisages a rationalisation of education expenditure, to be achieved through rationalisation of the teaching staff (see MTEF). The rationalization measures are to be accompanied by a rise in teachers' wages and a new system for linking performance to Secondary special (vacational) Full secondary Main secondary Primary 22Unemployment rate by the levels of educationComparison of the 1989 and 1999 census data Education and the MDGs shows that the share of the population over 15 MDG number 2 is formulated at the global level years old with secondary education (complete and as \"achieve universal primary education\" (see incomplete) has increased significantly . This figure chapter 1). According to the 1999 census data was 878 per 1000 in 1989, 909 in 1999 and 90 9, for Azerbaijan, 975 out of every 1000 persons 910, 910, 91 1 in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 in the 15-24 age group had completed at least respectively (see Table 2.5). It may be appropriate primary school education. In this index, women for the country to aim to improve its enrolment are slightly ahead of men (980 per 1000 rates for secondary education further , especially compared to 971 for men); and there are for upper secondary education. However , this will almost no urban and rural differences (975 be a viable goal for Azerbaijan only , if ef forts are compared to 976). Thus clearly MDG number 2 continued under SPPRED to improve the quality of will have to be adapted to reflect the fact that education in secondary schools. Participatory universal primary education is already a reality discussions carried out in 6 regions of Azerbaijan in Azerbaijan. have shown that the population considers improving quality of education and access to As mentioned above, one of SPPRED's key secondary education as one of the main problems strategic objectives, is to improve the quality of, (see chapter 7 for details on the Regional and equity of access to, basic education Workshops held in 6 regions). For this reason the services by 2005. Within this framework, goal of achieving universal primary and near-to- discussion has begun on identifying a country universal secondary education (11 classes) is put specific MDG for Azerbaijan in the field of forward as a tentative proposal for a country- education. specific MDG.

Despite this, overall gross enrolment rates remain relatively low (19% in 2002; see Table 2.6), and (a) Pre-school education (3-6 years) there are significant dif ferences between urban and rural enrolment rates.

This sharp increase is due to the school reforms of Unlike the previous stages of basic/secondary 1989, which introduced 1 1 years of schooling education, upper secondary education is not instead of the traditional 10 years. As can be obligatory . However , enrolment in these classes seen from Table 2.8, there are some gender has a direct impact on the numbers and quality of differences in enrolment rates. In 1990 female applicants for higher education. The results of enrolment rates were slightly higher than male the 1999 census showed that 41% of the urban ones in upper secondary education both in urban population and 50% of the rural population had (6.1% higher) and rural areas (4.7% higher). This completed full secondary education. The gross tendency is still noted in urban areas. There has enrolment rate for 10th-1 1th classes in 2002 been a small but consistent discrepancy (63.4%) almost reached the pre-transition (1990) between enrolment rates in urban and rural rate of 66.7% (see Table 2.8). areas (65% for urban areas in 2002 and 62% for rural areas).

More than half o f Public Expenditure on Health under-five mortality is caused by infant mortality . Public expenditure on health care as a share of GDP and a share of total budget expenditures has gradually decreased in the transition period (Figure 2.6). In 2002 public health expenditure totalled about 0.8% of GDP in comparison to 2.8% in 1990. This is the lowest level of expenditure among CIS countries, and 13 is one of the lowest in the world . (The average level for low-income countries is about 1.2% of 14 GDP) . SPPRED envisages a rise in public expenditures on health to 1.2% of GDP by 2005. The share of health expenditures in total budget expenditures also dropped from 8.9% in 1990 to 4.8% in 2002. The decrease in public expenditure on health has contributed to the deterioration in the quality of healthcare services and indirectly to the deterioration in the population's health status. These of ficial statistics are based on administrative data collected from medical facilities. However , evidence from survey data suggests that of ficial statistics underestimate the real situation in the country . Two recent surveys have provided much higher estimates of infant and under 5 mortality . The results of UNICEF's Multiple 15 Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) suggest that the infant mortality rate was close to 79 deaths per 1,000 infants and the child mortality rate (under 5 years old) was 102 in 1996. Infant mortality accounted for more than 77% of under 5 mortality . The results of the Reproductive Health Survey 16 (RHS) carried out in 2001, provide an estimate of 80.8 for infant mortality and 92.2 for under 5 Child W elfare: Infant and Under Five mortality for the 1991-2000 period.

The samples are designed in such a way According to the MICS results, the proportion of as to ensure that the results can be considered under-five stunting (height-for-age) children in representative for the whole country . As with all 2000 in Azerbaijan was 19.6%, of underweight survey data, there are confidence intervals (weight-for-age) children 16.8% and of wasting within which we can estimate with 95% (weight for height) children 7.9%.

According to the time of delivery but whose weight was less the RHS, the prevalence of chronic malnutrition 28(height-for-age) among children aged 3-59 months was 13.3%, general malnutrition (weight-for-age) 6.8%, and acute malnutrition 17 (weight-for-height) was 2.4% in 2001 . Usually , a low weight-for-age is considered an indicator of chronic malnutrition when a low prevalence of acute malnutrition exists. Because the total rate of acute malnutrition was low among under-five (3-59 months) Azeri children, the 6.8% rate of general malnutrition is probably a reflection of the higher rate of 18 stunting in children . RHS also provided higher estimates for stunting (chronic malnutrition) and underweight (general malnutrition) children in rural areas 15.9% and 7.8%, respectively (the indicators were 10.6% and 5.8% in urban areas). Regionally , children living in Southern (18.3%) and North & North-Immunization programs are being implemented in East (14.7%) regions had the highest levels of the country to help prevent child diseases.

Breastfeeding plays a significant role in the healthy development of children. The WHO recommendations state that \"infants should be fed exclusively on breast milk from birth to 4 months of age\" (RHS, pp 101). According to the SSC, about 30% of all infants are exclusively breast-fed until 3 months (see Figure 2.8). According to MICS, only 9.4% of infants under 4 months of age are exclusively breast-fed. According to RHS, 94.7% of all children born during 1996-2001 were breast fed for at least a short period of time; the average duration of exclusive breast-19 feeding was 0.4 months, full breast-feeding 3.3 months, and any breast-feeding 1 1.6 months. 17 Both MICS and RHS surveys used NCHS/CDC/WHO (U.S. National Center for Health Statistics Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO) as international reference (WHO, 1995). On the basis of this reference, children were classified as malnourished if they had a score level less than 2 standard deviations below the mean of the reference population (i.e. 2.00 SD) for any indicator.18 Serbanescu F. et al.

However , the main increases were in the 1990- 99 period, when the indicator peaked at 43.4 per 100,000 live births. Since then there has been a steady and notable improvement in the indicator . However , as with child and infant mortality , there is some evidence that of ficial figures underestimate the incidence of maternal increase in the number of childbirths not assisted mortality . Mothers who die from pregnancy by skilled health personnel. According to the and postpartum complications at home (after results of a survey carried out by SSC in 2001, only home deliveries or after being discharged from 79% of women complete pregnancy with delivery hospital) are not usually recorded as maternal in hospital.

Women sometimes deliver their children in younger ages, which increases health risks for themselves and their children. According to Social Monitor 2003, the share of births to mothers under age 20 increased from 4.7% of 22 total live births in 1990 to 9.7 in 2001 . According to WB estimates, births per 1,000 women ages 15-19 in Azerbaijan was 44 in 23 2002 (there are no regular of ficial statistics on teenage births).

According to the WB estimates (source: W orld Development Indicators 2003), the share of births attended by skilled persons in 2000 was 99% in Russia, 92% in Algeria, 81% in Turkey , 71% in Paraguay and 20% in Pakistan.

Abortions are prevalent particularly among organizations has extended family planning women in the 25-34 age group (55% of all services to the population, but abortion is still a abortions). The difference between the official common method of interruption of unwanted abortion rate and the survey result can be pregnancy . According to official data, abortions explained partly by the dif ference in data collection per 1,000 females aged 15-49 years has (the survey data are based on information per decreased from 13.3 in 1990 to 7 in 2002 1,000 women aged 15-44, whereas the of ficial (Figure 2.12). In comparison to this, abortions 28 per 100 births has increased from 14.0 to 17.6 data per 1,000 women aged 15-49 ); but also by in the same reference period. This is due to the data registration problems in state health care fact that there has been a steep decrease in the facilities; underreporting of abortions performed in birth rate, but not in the abortion rate. The the private sector; and abortions performed \"lifetime\" abortion rate (i.e. the average number outside clinics. of abortions per woman in the fertile age group) also tended to decrease according to of ficial The reduction in abortion rate is mirrored by an statistics.

According to the SSC the number of reported that the lowest use of contraception registered AIDS infected persons and HIV (7%) among the former Soviet Union countries infectors was 97 in 2002 (Figure 2.15). There is 29 some discrepancy between the data given by SSC was in Azerbaijan (1993) . The results of the and the Azerbaijan National Centre in Respond to RHS suggest that the current contraceptive AIDS. According to the latter , the number of HIV prevalence among currently married women of detected people was 105 in 2002 and the total reproductive age (15-44 years) is 55.4%. Only number of HIV infected people 556 by July 1, 11.9% of women in this category use modern 30 methods, the rest 43.5% traditional methods. 2003 . However , the actual number of HIV carriers According to MICS, 55.1% of all women of could be significantly higher than registered, reproductive age (15-49 years) are using any because the awareness of people about HIV/AIDS contraception (15.8% modern methods, is low , and only a very small part of population take 39.3% - traditional methods). HIV tests (although ef forts are being made to increase the amount of testing carried out; see below). In most cases infected people do not take the test for HIV/AIDS and remain unaware of their infection. For example, according to Azerbaijan National Centre in Respond to AIDS, only 164170 HIV tests were carried out in 2002, and more than 3,600,000 in the period of 1987 2002. The low level of use of contraceptives and the low awareness of people of HIV/AIDS means that there is a relatively high risk of being infected. The National AIDS Centre carried out a survey of HIV - infected citizens. The results suggest that about 90% of the respondents had no idea about AIDS before being infected with HIV . According to the RHS, 74% of women in fertile age have heard of HIV/AIDS, but 72% of women could not spontaneously state any main way of avoiding HIV infection. Lack of any preventive knowledge is higher among rural residents (84%), women Maternal health depends not only on the quality of maternal health services, but also on access to these services. Of ficial figures show that the number of female consultation units, child polyclinics and ambulatories decreased from 1034 in 1990 to 879 in 1999 but increased again to 917 in 2002. The number of beds for women who are just recovering from deliveries and childbirth did not fluctuate significantly (between 7,300 and 7,600) in the post-Soviet period and in 2002 the number was the same as in 1990 - 7,400.

The HIV surveillance system was introduced in Azerbaijan in 1987, and the Azerbaijan National Center in Respond to AIDS was established in 1990 as the only MOH institution responsible for the coordination and supervision of activities for the prevention of HIV in the Republic.

The pensions, wages, and per capita income additional welfare payments to unemployed amounts increased, but that real pensions and pensioners increased 1.6 times. per capita income decreased in 2000 in comparison with 1999. The situation improved Despite the low levels of pensions, the HBS results after 2000 (see Figure 2.24). for 2002 suggest that only 4.9% of all pensioners were poor . However , this result appears to be explained by the fact that most pensioners live with larger families, and benefit from the support of other household members. But if we look at the HBS results for households (rather than individuals), we find that almost 40% of all households can be considered poor (i.e. per capita household expenditure is less than 175,000 AZM); and of these (poor) households, 41% are headed Using data from the SSC, we can look at the same information for dif ferent categories of pensions.

The State Social Protection Fund's (SSPF) budget Social Assistance comes from two sources: social insurance contributions and transfers from the state budget. The main social assistance allowances are In 2003, 57.5% of the SSPF's budget came from one-of f benefits for child birth, benefits for social insurance contributions, and 42.5% from the children under 3, benefits for children under 16 state budget. The SSPF's 2003 budget included years, and benefits for guardianship. There are 711.24 billion AZM for benefits, equal to 39.3% of in fact a total of 35 separate benefits, and one of the total SSPF budget. State expenditure on social the aims of social assistance reform is to protection (through the SSPF) amounted to 768 gradually reduce this number and rationalize bln mantas, of which 586 billion was spent on the administration of the benefits, as well as social assistance benefits; 107 billion AZM for targeting them to the poorest sections of the subsidies for transport, communal and other kinds population. The current wide range of benefits of services, and 75 billion for social pension s. are mainly \"categorical\", i.e. they are paid to Table 2.23.

This shows that categorical benefits (eg one time benefits for giving birth, benefits for children under 3, benefits for children under 16 years, benefits for guardianship and so on) are not targeted to the poor . The situation regarding privileges is worse, with larger shares going to the top deciles than to the poorer bottom deciles. The first decile receives only 8.5% of all privileges, but the 8th decile's share is 17.8% (more than double), and the 10th decile gets 13.6%. We now look at the influence of social benefits (state benefits, pensions and privileges) in protecting people from poverty . As Figure 2.26 shows, despite the low level of benefits, they in fact have a significant influence on protecting people from poverty . If we subtract the value of the benefits from the per capita income of the recipients, we see that poverty incidence would rise by 30-40% if these people did not receive state social benefits. This result however cannot be interpreted as meaning that the benefit levels are definitely high enough to protect people from risks. In even a very slight increase in per capita income or fact, Figure 2.27 below shows that a large expenditure results in large changes in the number of the population are situated just numbers above the poverty line (taken here as above the poverty line, and this means that 175,000 AZM).0 20 40 60 80 100Nakhchivan Absheron Mughan-Salyan Ganja-GazakhSheki-ZagatalaLankoran-AstaraShirvan Garabag-MilBakuAzerbaijan Poverty level (after the per capita 50(per capita)With a view to achieving this goal the following Introduction objectives have been set in the Policy Matrix of One of the main strategic goals of the SPPRED within the framework of fiscal policy SPPRED is to maintain economic stability . development: Increasing the ef fectiveness of planning and expenditure by impro ving the budget process; The implementation status of the policy Increasing municipalities' revenues measures within the above mentioned objectives in 2003 is as follows: Although in the 2003 State Budget envisaged to allocate subsidies of 25 billion AZM to municipal Increasing the effectiveness of the budget budgets, only 5 billion AZM were allocated for the process above-mentioned purpose.

The MDGs were set out in the Millennium Declaration adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2000. They are a set of 8 goals, which provide a focus for the efforts of the world community to achieve measurable improvements in people's lives by the year 2015. The full MDG framework comprises of 8 goals, 18 targets and 48 indicators. Most targets are to be achieved over a 25 year period, from 1990 to 2015. The MDG goals and targets are set on at the global level. Azerbaijan is now embarking on the task of setting country-specific goals and targets. The table below summarizes the results of the country discussion to date. Global MDGs Azerbaijan country-specific MDGs Notes Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Goal 1: Reduction of poverty Target 1: Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than one dollar a day Target 1: Reduce, between 2002 and 2015, the proportion of people whose per capita monthly consumption expenditure is below the country's absolute poverty line Although SPPRED was based on 2001 poverty results, it would be better to take 2002 as the baseline, since both the survey methodology for data collection and the poverty line methodology were changed in 2002, but should be consistent from now on for monitoring purposes. Baseline for 2002 is 46.7%. Per capita consumption expenditure rather than income is the preferred welfare indicator for Azerbaijan. Indicator 1 : Proportion of population below $1 per day (PPP values) Indicator 1: Proportion of population with per capita monthly expenditure levels below the absolute poverty line The methodology for the absolute poverty line is due to be approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in the coming months. A target/ indicator based on the proportion of people below the one dollar per day poverty line would be desirable. However, the WB recommends a poverty rate of $2.15 per day for CIS countries, so this would be more appropriate. There is too much controversy currently surrounding the PPP rate for Azerbaijan, making the 2 calculation of this indicator unreliable. The WB Poverty Assessment (2002), attempt to calculate this using a revised PPP rate (see Box 1.2 of the report; the revised rate is AZM 2,151 for 2001, compared to AZM 976), but for the purposes of setting a MDG target, it is best to wait for an official review of the PPP. Indicator 2 : Poverty gap ratio (incidence x depth of poverty) Indicator 2: Poverty gap ratio Calculated on the basis of the absolute poverty line now being considered by the Cabinet of Ministers. Baseline for 2002 is 0.0822. Indicator 3 : Share of poorest quintile in national consumption Indicator 3 : Share of poorest quintile in national consumption Baseline for 2002 is 15.1%. Target 2 : Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger Target 2 : Reduce, between 2002 and 2015, the proportion of people in extreme poverty. Halve the share of the population below the relative poverty line of the country SPPRED estimates the extent of extreme poverty as 17%, using a poverty line of 60% of the median per capita consumption expenditure level. Again, it would be better to use 2002 as the baseline, since the survey methodology and poverty line should be stable from now on. Extreme poverty for 2002 is estimated at 11%, using a relative poverty line equal to 70% of the median per capita monthly consumption expenditure level. Baseline for 2002 is 11%. Indicator 4: Prevalence of underweight children (under five years of age) Indicator 4: Prevalence of underweight children (under five years of age) If MICS is carried out regularly (on a 4-5 year basis), this data source could be used to provide estimates of underweight children. In 2000 - 16.8 (MICS data) In 2001 - 6.8% (RHS data) Indicator 5: Proportion of population below minimum level of dietary energy consumption Indicator 5: Share of boys and girls aged 6-10 year old with goiter and anemia This is recommended by WHO in Azerbaijan, but more information is required on the availability of data on goiter. Anemia can be monitored for 0-14 years since 2001. No information on goiter available from official statistics. Prevalence of anemia among children aged 0-14 years: In 2001 - 0.5%; In 2002 - 0.6%. 3 Indicator 6: Gender disaggregated unemployment rates and employment and in the non-oil sector Data to monitor employment will be available from 2003 onwards, due to the introduction of a new labor force survey. The President of the Republic has set a target of creating 600,000 new jobs by 2008. Indicator 7: Number of children entering institutional care due to fact that parents are too poor to support them. Data on children in institutional care is being improved and will be checked for suitability as a monitoring indicator. Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education Goal 2: Achieve near-to-universal secondary education Universal primary education is already a reality in Azerbaijan. The problem is to improve the quality of primary and other stages of education. It is considered important to achieve near to full secondary education for all (i.e. classes 1 - 11; at present education is obligatory up to class 9). However, it has to be stressed that near- to-full enrolment for full secondary education is only a worthwhile goal, if it is accompanied by the measures envisaged in SPPRED to improve the quality of school education. Target 3 : Ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling Target 3: Ensure that, by 2015, almost all boys and girls will be able to complete a full course of secondary education Universal secondary education is not considered a realistic goal, but a target will be set for near-to-universal secondary education Indicator 6 : Net enrolment ratio in primary education Indicator 8: Gross and net enrolment ratios in secondary education Current methods of data collection only allow calculation of gross enrolment rates. This will be improved in the near future, and net enrolment rates will also be available. Indicator 7 : Proportion of pupils starting grade 1 who reach grade 5 Indicator 9: Attendance rates for secondary education (by class, by gender) Current methods of data collection do not allow the calculation and monitoring of attendance rates, but this is an improvement in monitoring methods which is envisaged by SPPRED, and which will be implemented in the near future. Attendance rates for the upper secondary 4 Not yet available: administrative data may be available from 2004 school classes will also be important for the monitoring the differences in gender equality/ opportunities. They will also be a proxy indicator for monitoring improvement in the quality of education. Attendance should be monitored using administrative and survey sources. Data are not yet available and administrative data may be available from 2004. Indicators will have to be found to monitor improvements in the quality of education at secondary schools (for example, learning achievement) Indicator 8 : Literacy rate of 15-24 year olds Indicator 10: Literacy rate of 15-24 year olds Literacy rates are currently almost universal, but this indicator will continued to be monitored for the purposes of comparison with other countries. According to 1999 census data: per 1000 population male - 971 and female - 980. Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women Target 4 : Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education preferably by 2005 and to all levels of education no later than 2015 Target 4 : Maintain gender equality in primary and secondary education, and improve gender equality in higher education by 2015 Enrolment rates in primary and secondary education show no gender differences (see chapter on education). However, attendance rates will be monitored to check for gender differences which are not captured by enrolment rates. Females are less likely to continue to higher education, and the goal is therefore set of achieving gender equality in higher education Indicator 9 : Ratio of girls to boys in primary, secondary and tertiary education Indicator 11 : Ratio of girls to boys in primary, secondary and tertiary education As in the education chapter, these enrolment indicators will continued to be monitored, and will be supplemented by ratios based on attendance. Indicator 10 : Ratio of literate females to males of 15-24 year olds Indicator 12 : Ratio of literate females to males of 15-24 year olds No discrepancy currently evident, but this indicator will be monitored. 5 Indicator 11 : Share of women in wage employment in the non- agricultural sector Indicator 13 : This indicator is still being discussed. It has to be adapted for Azerbaijan, to cover the share of women in top wage sectors/ jobs. Data availability is still being checked. Indicator 12 : Proportion of seats held by women in national parliament Indicator 14 : Share of women represented in top positions in economic and political life This indicator still has to be refined. National parliament is not considered suitable for Azerbaijan. Women are quite well represented there, but not in top government and economic positions. Data sources have to be checked. Goal 4: Reduce child mortality Goal 4: Reduce child mortality Target 5 : Reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate Target 5 : Reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate The problem with all the targets and indicators under goals 4 and 5 is the discrepancy between official data (based on administrative sources) and survey estimates. (see chapter on health) Efforts will be made in the future to improve administrative data, and surveys will continue to be carried out. In the meantime, targets will be set using both administrative and survey data as baselines; i.e. two targets are set for target 5 and target 6: one using administrative data as the baseline, and one using UNICEF's MICS estimates as the baseline. Another problem is that 1990 is not always the best baseline: indicators worsened considerably in the first transition years, and taking 1990 as the baseline means setting unrealistic targets, and underestimating achievements in improving the situation. Indicator 13: Under-five mortality rate Indicator 15: Under-five mortality rate (per 1,000 children) Will continued to be monitored using administrative and survey data (see health chapter) Indicator 14 : Infant mortality rate Indicator 16 Infant mortality rate (per 1000 live births) Will continued to be monitored using administrative and survey data (see health chapter) 6 Indicator 15 : Proportion of 1 year old children immunized against measles Indicator 17 : Proportion of 1 year old children immunized against measles Goal 5: Improve maternal health Goal 5: Improve maternal health Target 6: Reduce by three-quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio Target 6: Reduce by three-quarters, between 1995 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio; i.e. from 37 per 100,000 live births in 1995 to 13 in 2015, using administrative data and from 79 per 100,000 live births (estimate for 1988) to 27 in 2015, using survey estimates See note on Target 5. 1990 is not considered a good baseline because it does not reflect the difficulties which the country had to face in the transition period, which were reflected in the worsening indicators for maternal health and mortality in the post 1990 period. Therefore 1995 is taken as the baseline. Indicator 16 : Maternal mortality ratio Indicator 18 : Maternal mortality ratio Will continued to be monitored using administrative and survey data (see health chapter) Indicator 17 : Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel Indicator 19 : Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel Will continued to be monitored using administrative and survey data (see health chapter) Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases Target 7 : Have halted by 2015, and begun to reverse, the spread of HIV/AIDS Target 7 : Have halted by 2015, and begun to reverse, the spread of HIV/AIDS The problem is the data for setting a baseline and monitoring success in achieving the target. The number of HIV test performed in the country decreased from 300,000 per year in the early 1990s to 12,000 in 1998. There is a risk that the data available underestimates the problem due to the fact that not enough tests are performed. 556 cases recorded (1 July 2003) by National Centre in 7 Response to AIDS) Indicator 18 : HIV prevalence among 15-24 year old pregnant women Indicator 20 : HIV prevalence among 15-24 year old pregnant women Currently a problem with data collection for monitoring Indicator 19 : Contraceptive prevalence rate Indicator 21 : Contraceptive prevalence rate Estimates available through survey estimates only (RHS, 2001) Indicator 20 : Number of children orphaned by HIV/AIDS Indicator 22 : Number of children orphaned by HIV/AIDS Currently none according to official data. (see Epidemiological Fact Sheets, UNAIDS, UNICEF, WHO) Will be monitored as data availability improves. Target 8 : Have halted by 2015, and begun to reverse, the incidence of malaria and other major diseases Target 8 : Have halted by 2015, and begun to reverse, the incidence of malaria and other major diseases Here we have kept malaria and TB as the major diseases. But initial discussion suggests that it may be advisable to include a target for reducing incidence of brucollosis Indicator 21 : Prevalence and death rates associated with malaria Indicator 23 : Prevalence and death rates associated with malaria Indicator 22 : Proportion of population in malaria risk areas using effective malaria prevention and treatment measures Indicator 24 : Proportion of population in malaria risk areas using effective malaria prevention and treatment measures Indicator 23: Prevalence and death rates associated with tuberculosis Indicator 25: Prevalence and death rates associated with tuberculosis 8 Indicator 24 : Proportion of TB cases detected and cured under DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short Course) Indicator 26 : Proportion of TB cases detected and cured under DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short Course) More discussion required with WHO on how to monitor this. Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability Target 9: Integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programs and reverse the loss of environmental resources Target 9: Integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programmes and reverse the loss of environmental resources Indicator 25 : Proportion of land area covered by forest Indicator 27 : Proportion of land area covered by forest As proposed by SPPRED, this has to be done in a sensitive manner, taking into account the access of local communities and poor to grazing land, energy supplies etc. (eg, collection of firewood cannot be forbidden by administrative order, if there are no alternative forms of heating available to the community. This measure has to be carried out parallel to improvements in the supply of energy sources to rural communities) Official data on proportion of land area by forest will have to be checked. Indicator 26 : Land area protected to maintain biological diversity Indicator 28 : Land area protected to maintain biological diversity As above; indicators have to be checked Need to explore the possibility of developing an indicator related to share of GDP spent on environmental measures It may be suitable to monitor an indicator concerning land salinisation. Data on this is available. Indicator 27: GDP per unit of energy use (as proxy for energy efficiency) Indicator 29: GDP per unit of energy use (as proxy for energy efficiency) Has been calculated for HDR reports. This indicator will be monitored in the future. 9 Indicator 28 : Carbon dioxide emissions (per capita) [Plus tow figures of global atmospheric pollution: ozone depletion and the accumulation of global warming gases] Indicator 30 : Carbon dioxide emissions (per capita) [Plus two figures of global atmospheric pollution: ozone depletion and the accumulation of global warming gases] Target 10: Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water Target 10: Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water Administrative data on access to piped water: 1990 - 89.2 2015 - 44.6 An exact target cannot be set until monitoring of safe drinking water is improved. SPPRED envisages improvement of the monitoring system (in health sector policy matrix) Indicator 29: Proportion of population with sustainable access to an improved water source Indicator 31: Proportion of population with sustainable access to an improved water source Administrative data on access to piped water: 1990 - 95.7% (urban); 10.8% (rural) - 94.2% (urban); 11.2% (rural) Administrative data are not available. Some estimates are possible through the HBS. There is data on access to water through pipes, and there are stark differences between urban and rural areas. A target may be set to increase access of rural areas to piped water. However, this target will have to be accompanied by targets for ensuring that the quality of the water delivered through the pipes is up to health standards, and that the supply through the pipes is regular. Adminstrative data on access to the piped water in 2002: 94.2% - urban; 11.2% - rural. Target 11: By 2020, to have achieved a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers For discussion - a shorter term target (2010?) may be appropriate for Azerbaijan - to ensure by this date that all IDPs are re-settled from accommodation with limited access to sanitation etc. Indicator 30 : Proportion of people with access to improved sanitation As above 10 Indicator 31 : Proportion of people with access to secure tenure [Urban/rural disaggregation of several of the above indicators may be relevant for monitoring improvement in the lives of slum dwellers] As above Goal 8: Develop a Global Partnership for Development Goal 8: Increase FDI in the non-oil sector All of this section needs further discussion. Exports from the non-oil sector could also be used as an indicator. Target 12 : Develop further an open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system. Includes a commitment to good governance, development, and poverty reduction - both nationally and internationally Target 13 : Address the special needs of the least developed countries Includes: tariff and quota free access to LDC exports; enhanced program of debt relief for HIPC and cancellation of official bilateral debt; and more generous ODA for countries committed to poverty reduction (Indicators 32-36 relate to ODA) Indicator 32 : Net ODA as percentage of DAC donors' GNI [targets of 0.7% in total and 0.15% for LDCs] 11 Indicator 33 : Proportion of ODA to basic social services (basic education, primary health care, nutrition, safe water and sanitation) Indicator 34 : Proportion of ODA that is untied Indicator 35 : Proportion of ODA for environment in small island developing states Indicator 36 : Proportion of ODA for transport sector in land- locked countries Target 14: Address the special needs of landlocked countries and small island developing states (Through Barbados Program and 22nd General Assembly provisions: Indicators 27-40 relate to Market Access) Indicator 37 : Proportion of exports (by value and excluding arms) admitted free of duties and quotas Indicator 38: Average tariffs and quotas on agricultural products and textiles and clothing 12 Indicator 39 : Domestic and export agricultural subsidies in OECD countries Indicator 40 : Proportion of ODA provided to help build trade capacity Target 15: Deal comprehensively with the debt problems of developing countries through national and international measures in order to make debt sustainable in the long term (Indicators 41-44 relate to Debt Sustainability) Indicator 41 : Proportion of official bilateral HIPC debt cancelled Indicator 42 : Debt service as a percentage of exports of goods and services Indicator 43: Proportion of ODA provided as debt relief Indicator 44 : Number of countries reaching HIPC decision and completion points 13 Target 16: In co-operation with developing countries, develop and implement strategies for decent and productive work for youth Indicator 45 : Unemployment rate of 15-24 year olds This will be monitored, as with the employment indicators mentioned under Goal 1. Target 17: In co-operation with pharmaceutical companies, provide access to affordable, essential drugs in developing countries Indicator 46 : Proportion of population with access to affordable essential drugs on a sustainable basis Target 18 : In co-operation with the private sector, make available the benefits of new technologies, especially information and communications Indicator 47 : Telephone lines per 1000 people Data available, and this is considered important to monitor Indicator 48 : Personal computers per 100 people Data available, and this is considered important to monitor 1 Appendix 2 Mid-term Expenditure Framework for 2003-2005 (MTEF) and State Budget for 2003-2004 Introduction Mid-term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) is one of the integral parts of the State Programme on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development for 2003-2005 in the Republic of Azerbaijan (SPPRED), which was approved by the relevant Decree of President of the Republic of Azerbaijan in February 20, 2003. Prudent expenditure policy and non-inflationary budget deficit financing did not only ensure economic stability, it is also directed at strengthening economic growth and reducing poverty through measures related to tax policy and expenditure prioritization. MTEF includes projections of Government resources available for 2002-2005, calculated on the bases of macroeconomic forecasts, the expenditure strategy and explanation of detailed expenditure plans. It is envisaged that MTEF will be reviewed annually in the process of budget approval. This report presents all the achievements in implementation of the MTEF from the date of approval of the SPPRED up to now (in particular, the latest legal and institutional development in budget management, changes in the tax system and expenditure). The report deals with reflection of policy measures stipulated in the SPPRED in the approved budgets for 2003 and 2004. The budget figures in SPPRED have been replaced by actual figures for 2002. Neither revenue sources nor budget breakdown by functional and economic classifications were presented for 2005-2007, therefore SPPRED for 2005 is not discussed here. Legal and institutional changes in the budget management The Government has achieved considerable progress in development of a legal and institutional framework for budget management since the SPPRED was approved. The major step in enhancing efficiency, transparency and accountability in the budget management was the approval of the new \"Budget System\" Law in 2002. Additions and changes were made to the \"Budget System\" Law in May 2003 in order to bring it in accordance with international standards. Unlike the old law, the new law covers all elements of the budget system, including budgets of the local self-governments and extra-budgetary funds, and sets out the below-mentioned measures: (i) publication of the draft annual budget law in the press prior to submission to the Milli Majlis (Parliament); (ii) approval of the state budget following more detailed discussion of each sub-item within functional classification paragraphs by the Milli Majlis for the first time; (iii) submission of three-year economic and budget forecasts to the Milli Majlis along with a draft annual budget law for the next year; and (iv) publication of the quarterly reports on the execution of the consolidated budget in the press. Additions and changes to this law, which were made in May 2003 provide the Milli Majlis with the authority to approve expenditure and deficit ceilings for the consolidated budget, excluding SOFAR revenues. These additions and changes envisage the below-mentioned: \u00a7 All operations of the consolidated budget (except SOFAR revenues, operational expenses and foreign investments) should be carried out by the Treasury; \u00a7 All capital expenditure should be included in the Public Investment Program; \u00a7 Extra-budgetary funds, including SOFAR, can not make investments in domestic commercial activities or issue loans or loan guarantees; 2 \u00a7 SOFAR should hold equity positions abroad only through rated professional portfolio managers. As a result of economic reforms programme, which has been implemented by the Government since 1995, public funds have undergone substantial structural changes. Thus, the following important measures have been undertaken in this regard: a treasury system has been established, transperancy and accountability in the public funds have been brought to the forefront, municipalities have been established and their financing sources identified. Now with huge investments in BTC pipeline and Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) development it is expected that oil and gas production, as well their export will increase sharply starting from 2006-2007. It should be noted that the challenge for the government is not only the very rapid growth of resources available for expenditure but ensuring rationale use of the revenues, which will flow in the country in 2006 and 2008. Even under a very conservative scenario of economic development, this will bring to an increase of more than 50% of the existing government revenues between 2006 and 2008. The government will refrain from spending all available resources on a year-by-year basis, and pursue a fiscal policy that recognizes the need for sustainability in a long-term outlook. MTEF included into the SPPRED was the first step towards multi-year fiscal forecasting. Then in accordance with new Budget System Law by April 15th MoF prepared and submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers the draft Mid-term Budget Forecast for the next year and Mid-term Consolidated Budget Forecast for the next three years, which included total expenditure for the parts of consolidated budget. In October 2003 draft state budget for 2004 and draft consolidated budgets for the next three years were submitted to the Milli Majlis. A number of measures had been taken to ensure transparency, accountability and efficiency in the public finances and to strengthen expenditure control. Starting with the 2003 budget, all extra- budgetary funds of budgetary organizations were included in the State Budget. In 2002 the State Budget started to allocate implicit subsidies to electricity and gas sectors for nonpayment of fuel provided by the SOCAR and in 2003 a mechanism was identified to deliver implicit subsidies. Furthermore, the state budget for 2004 envisages allocating implicit subsidies to the chemical sector. New budget classification was developed and submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers. Draft Law on State Debt and State Guarantees was prepared, Regulations on the register of State Foreign Debt of Azerbaijan Republic was developed. Program on transition to the international accounting standards has been approved. Treasury computerization process has started: a tender has been announced by the World Bank to equip pilot areas. Resource envelope and performance As revenue is largely a function of growth in economy it is necessary to look at the overall economic performance. In total, growth of the real gross domestic product is expected to average about 11% annually in real terms for the period 2003 - 20051. The oil sector is forecast to grow very strongly, averaging 11% annually. The non-oil economy is also forecast to perform well, averaging 12% growth annually. It is necessary to note that these growth rates will not be evenly spread throughout the 2003 - 2005 period. Major spending on oil developments will not begin until 2005. 1 Unless otherwise noted, as here, all figures are nominal. 2 A nominal financial unit is 5,500 AZM. 3 Table 1: Economic Growth Forecast 2002 actual 2003 actual 2004 forecast 2005 forecast Average 2003 - 2005 Real GDP 10.6% 13.6% 14.6% 15.3% On the basis of this growth forecast, an estimate of tax and non-tax revenues has been prepared. These estimates show that the increase in tax and non-tax revenues will be average 12% per annum. The Government envisages a number of measures consistent with the MTEF while identifying the revenue sources. Thus revenue collections are forecasted to increase at the Ministry of Taxes and State Customs Committee by virtue of better administration. In order to encourage entrepreneurship and to increase the level of employment, the following changes in the tax system were approved. It mainly covers the following: Enterprise profit tax was lowered from January 1, 2003 from 27% to 25% and at the same time government introduced a regional differentiated taxation principle on profit tax with the aim of encouraging development of the regions. Following discussions with the IMF, which argued that regionally differentiated tax policies are not effective and that these prevent the government's efforts to improve the tax administration, the profit tax was determined at the level of 24% and approved by the Milli Majlis on January 16, 2004 starting from 2004. The area of introduction of simplified tax was extended from January 1, 2003 and its rates for the regions were determined. Simplified tax turnover has been increased from 300 times of the non- taxable monthly income by 22,500 times of the nominal financial unit2 (i.e. 123,750 thousand AZM) in order to expand coverage of the simplified tax system. Now, this tax is also applied to private individuals doing business without creating a legal entity. Moreover, in order to give an impetus to the development of entrepreneuarial activities in the regions of the country and reduce poverty and open new jobs, the following rates of the simplified tax were introduced: 4% - in Baku City and 2% - in the regions. Furthermore, liability for private property, subject to simplified tax has been increased from 5 bln. AZM to 5.5 bln. since 2004. The amount of property tax imposed since 2004 has been increased from 50,000 times of the non-taxable monthly income, i.e. from 5 bln. AZM of nominal financial unit to 1,000,000 times, i.e. 5.5 bln. AZM. The relevant work has been done to study the possibilities to reduce income tax from individuals. The Law on the \"State Budget of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2004\" envisages to increase non- taxable monthly income from 100,000 AZM to 150,000 AZM and to move from AZM). Social contribution rate has been decreased from 29% to 27% since 2003. In 2003 some extra-budgetary funds of budgetary organizations were eliminated and those that remain were included into the state budget. It is forecasted that SOFAR's financing of pro-poor capital projects will increase substantially and SOFAR will transfer to the State budget around USD mln. 380 for this purpose during 2003-2005 (USD mln. 100 - in 2003, 130 - in 2004 and 150 - in 2005). 4 Starting from 2003 implicit subsidies to the energy sector was included into the Consolidated Budget and subsidies per annum are approved by the Parliament with the annual Budget Law. In 2003 budget amount of subsidies approved made up 1,559 bln. AZM, in 2004 budget - 2,332 bln. AZM. The government remains committed to honouring its limit on contracting external debt. New external debt is limited to USD 200 millions per year during 2003-2005 and all borrowings will be on concessional terms. WB PRSC credit is under discussion with the Government. With existing loans, funds will be disbursed as follows: Table 2: External Financing (USD millions) 2002 actual 2003 budget 2004 budget 2005 forecast Average 2003 - 2005 Foreign loans for deficit financing (SAC II, PRSP) 30 34 20 15 23 Net project loans (1)=(2)+(3) 127 128 97 97 107 Loans to the government (2) 14 34 49 59 47 Net credits to budgetary organizations (3)=(4)-(5) 113 93 48 38 60 Disbursements (4) 122 103 60 50 71 Contracted 122 105 35 28 56 New 0 0 0 0 0 Repayments (5) 9 10 12 12 11 Contracted 9 10 12 12 11 New 0 0 0 0 0 Total external financing (bln.

Maintaining macroeconomic stability remains as a main policy target and furthermore in the face of anticipated rapid growth in oil related revenues in the coming years government will pay crucial attention to the increase of oil related revenues and the expenditure rise. Large-scale reforms in public sector pay system are not envisaged during 2002-2003 and in the approved 2004 budget. A partial civil servants pay reform started in 2003 and expected to continue in 2004. The unification of pay scales for employees, rationalization of public sector workforce and decompression outlines in the SPPRED has not been addressed. Instead, Government as a continuation of previous years experience in 2003 implemented selective raise of wages for education, health, science, social security, sport, youth, culture, art, mass media, agriculture, forestry, fishery, amelioration and water industry, ecology and hydrometeorology employees by 50%. Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan of November 24, 2004 \"On measures to accelerate social and economic development in the Republic of Azerbaijan\" could be considered as an impulse to public sector pay reform. Regarding the policy of rationalization of expenditure on health care, education, and social assistance announced in the SPPRED, the following measures were undertaken by the Government. Due to salary increase in 2003 from the middle of year education expenditure increase in 2004 budget will be 20.6% instead of 10.1% envisaged in the SPPRED. Opposite to education health expenditure in 2004 will only increase by 16.6% instead of 29.5% outlined in SPPRED. Salary increase for the employees in this sector in 2003 was at the same (50%) level as for the other selected groups. Low average monthly wage, which after increase made up to around 76 thousand AZM (for comparison in education after increase average wage made up to 237 thousand AZM), was not encouraging for health care workers to render higher quality medical services. No further increase for healthcare workers was envisaged in 2004 budget. At the same time to ensure that there is universal access to basic health care in 2003 Government eliminated all payments for the services provided by the out-patients' clinic. At the same time in 2003-2004 budgets there were less provisions made for primary health care (which is the main component of structural reform and will result in more cost-effective delivery of basic health services) than was intended in the SPPRED. Pensions of pensioners in all categories increased approximately 40% starting from August 1, 2003. Decision was not taken on the provision of compensation to households in line with the increases in utility collection rate envisaged in the energy sector reform program is not made. 6 Government identified reduction of unemployment as one of the main tasks of the State Programme in the social and economic development of the regions and intends to create 600, 000 new jobs for the next five years. The government has started preparing mid-term social assistance strategy. In order to support economic growth, the government has started to pay more attention to and intends substantially increase expenditure on economic services (expenditure on housing and utility; fuel and energy; agriculture, forestry and fisheries; industry and construction; transport and communications). Much of this expenditure will be by its nature pro-poor, being either capital expenditure on building or rehabilitating infrastructure, or spending on programs to support the poor, such as provision of subsidised credits to farmers and entrepreneurs. Government prepared Public Investment Program for 2003 -2005 and for 2004-2007. Most of PIP projects are related to infrastructure rehabilitation and investments in social sector. It is intended to include all capital expenditure into the PIP which in accordance with the new Budget System Law will be presented to the Milli Majlis. Expenditures on operational costs were increased, in order to allow for increased payment for utilities by budgetary organizations, as well as to implement SPPRED measures in education, health and other sectors. In 2002 actual goods and services expenditure were 13% more than in 2001 and within the next two years they are expected to increase 68%. Utility payments by the budgetary organizations for 2002-2004 will be more than doubled. While about 30% of consolidated expenditure was directed towards households as transfers, for example, while 17% was used for new capital expenses and maintenance of existing facilities, fully 50% of the consolidated budget was spent on health, education, and social protection, 10% was spent on defense, in 2001, the following key changes were made in 2002 and approved to be implemented by the end of 2004 (structure of 2002-2004 budgets are considered without quasi- fiscal subsidies). Capital expenditure, which includes major rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, and building new infrastructure, increased to 21.3% of total spending in 2004 and will fall back to 2001 level in 2004. Wages and salaries fell from 22% to 19% in 2002, but as a result of salary increase in 2004 they will reach 24% of total expenditure reflecting mainly 2003 pay increase. Health expenditure dropped 4% to 3% of total expenditure in 2002, but it is forecasted to be maintained at the same level by the end of 2004. Taking into consideration lack of financing over the last years, health spending rise will be continued in 2005. Education expenditure fell from 17% to 15% of total expenditure in 2002, but is going to be compensated in 2004 and will be at 2001 level. Within the education sector, despite of the measures, mentioned in the SPPRED, there will be no change in the expenditure structure, what means there are no serious reforms planned to be implemented within this period in the education sector. Government continued its expansionary policy on social insurance and social assistance and in 2002 directed 30% (29% in 2001) and in 2004 around 28% of total expenditure to this area. No reform measures were considered in the budgets of 2002-2004. This rise in capital expenditure is also reflected by a change in the share of expenditure on economic services, which in 2002 increased from 22% to 26% of total expenditure, in 2004 due to fall in foreign financed project loans they will be only 23% of total government spending without implicit subsidies. 7 Table 5: Structure of Consolidated Expenditure (excluding implicit subsidies)3 2001 2002 2003 2004 2001 2002 2003 2004 Growth (2001-2003) % in total % in total % in total % in total bln.

These years will be characterized in significant changes in expenditure policy over the next period starting from 2005-2006, when oil revenue flow to the budget will increase and the \"Dutch disease\" problem will need to be addressed. NOTE: figures in column 2004 of Table 5 are not based on the consolidated budget but the State Budget. 3 Because of absence of data on 2001 implicit subsidies in order to provide comparability of 2002-2004 data quasi-fiscal subsidies were excluded from 2002-2004 consolidated expenditure.
