(Casey Kreider/Daily Inter Lake) [Previous](#slider) [Next](#slider) | February 12, 2023 12:00 AM A father-daughter team, both doctors of acupuncture and Chinese medicine, have opened the Kalispell Collective in downtown Kalispell aiming to provide compassionate, patient-centered care to the community. The Kalispell Collective comprises three entities: Jing Shen Healing Arts, an acupuncture clinic, Ancient Ways Apothecary, offering herbal remedies, and COZY Kalispell, an herbal foot soak experience. James and Devynne Berry designed the Kalispell Collective to be a space where community members and wellness-focused providers can collaborate, grow, and heal together. While James and Devynne have equal values and goals for the Kalispell Collective, their journeys into the world of Chinese medicine are unique. \"I played softball growing up and had a few injuries that I could never get right with Western medicine,\" said Devynne. \"My injuries never resolved and acupuncture was one of the last things we could try so I got some acupuncture treatments and had no issues with my injuries again. It became part of my health regimen.\" With a background in massage and Qigong, a practice that incorporates body, breath, and movement, James saw the life-changing effects of acupuncture on his daughter. \"When Devynne was getting treatment I got to watch it be so effective for her pain,\" James said. \"I decided to commit to learning the traditions of medicine and learned that the five elements tradition is a more classical approach to Chinese medicine.\" While using acupuncture to prepare for a shoulder surgery in college, Devynne discovered the five elements theory of Chinese medicine. \"My first experience with the five elements, which is what we practice here, changed my whole world. I remember laying on the table and feeling lighter and suddenly everything was brighter. A lot of elements in my life started shifting,\" Devynne said. \"I didn't necessarily want to be studying what I was in school for, and I had lots of other revelations. The next thing I knew I was applying to acupuncture school.\" James and Devynne explained that the five elements theory is rooted in nature and incorporates the elements of water, wood, fire, earth, and metal into the practice. After passing four national board exams and becoming certified, James and Devynne practiced in South Carolina for 10 years. \"We do a lot of trauma recovery for people,\" James said. \"It's really rewarding to watch the lights come back on and see them connect with themselves, find joy and hope again, watch the anxiety and depression go away, move past grief, and recover from things life has thrown at them.\" With the goal of serving their community, James and Devynne offer free monthly acupuncture clinics and yoga for veterans, first responders, and their spouses, as well as monthly wellness talks on topics such as gut health, herbs, and mental health that are free for the public to attend. \"We introduce people to a different way to think about their health or help them find a new tea or find a yoga space they might be searching for,\" James says. \"We honor the uniqueness of people.\" James' partner, Sarah Schmidt, a nurse practitioner, is also heavily involved in the event planning and hosts a monthly \"Sip and Soak.\" \"Sarah has fun making the teas we sell here and leading Sip and Soaks where people do a tea tasting and end the night with a foot soak. If you ever come in here while she's here, she'll chat you up and give you a cup of tea,\" James said with a laugh. When the father-daughter team moved to the Flathead Valley, they had seven blends of teas they brought with them from South Carolina, but wanted to create more. \"So we went on this journey to blend more, curate some, and find out what people like,\" Devynne said. \"We went on a hunt to match certain flavor profiles that people were looking for and now we have over 30 different blends. We are also putting some teas together for new moms and expecting moms and playing with some different blends for them.\" In addition to the teas, James and Devynne are working on putting together over-the-counter herbal supplements to treat and prevent general ailments such as colds and flus. The Berrys encourage customers to ask questions and to utilize the Kalispell Collective as a local resource to make the best decisions for their health. Because of their doctorates in Chinese medicine, it brings a different perspective to health, James notes. \"Our practice is different from going somewhere, pulling something off of a shelf, and not really having guidance,\" James said. \"It's neat to solve some of those cases where some doctors said, 'This is just the way it's going to be.' We've put years into this study and then years into the practice, so the advice we give comes from a place of experience and knowledge.\" The Kalispell Collective is located at 149 South Main Street in Kalispell and is open seven days a week.
