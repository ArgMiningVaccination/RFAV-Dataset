Owner Sue Crielaard opened the small shop, which features a retail section in the front and treatment room in the back, over five years ago. Needing space for instructing her reiki students, she opened a second location at 806 Osborne St. South two years ago. Prior to becoming a business owner, Crielaard worked in the social services sector for three decades. \"I was always involved in community development - community rehabilitation work,\" she said. \"Spirit is a whole different way to help people.\" Successful entrepreneurs are passionate about their services and products, and Crielaard is no different, even though her services are more spiritual than tangible, and her products are unique. She specializes in Akashic reiki, which is a deep treatment combining Akashic reference reading with reiki. Three other reiki practitioners share her space on St. Mary's Road and also offer other spiritual healing modalities and card reading. A trained herbalist, Crielaard sells herbal concoctions and teas featuring natural ingredients. She also stocks essential oils for aromatherapy, spiritual cleansing products and crystals. Crielaard has between 20 and 30 students working toward their reiki certification. \"There's no competition in this field,\" she said. \"Each person offers something different. Everyone benefits when we can team up and share.\" In the spirit of sharing, Crielaard is forming the Manitoba Reiki Association, a non-profit organization to help streamline the practice of reiki and hopefully have it recognized as a therapeutic service by health insurance companies. While the pandemic was hard on many small businesses, Crielaard said the enforced solitude and slower pace of life that most people experienced turned out to be positive for herself and other reiki specialists. People had the extra time available to focus on their spiritual needs and she kept busy with appointments and teaching. \"A lot of people recognized their healing abilities,\" she said, noting that many of her students and clients are health-care professionals. While her storefront might be tricky to find, she said she's amazed by the distances that some of her clients travel to reach her shop. She's grateful for her loyal customers and said they help her business to evolve. \"They show me what to do next,\" she said.
