Educational Presentations Salon and Spa ProgramsTABLE OF CONTENTS 2Active Treatment1 3 4 6 7Support Programs Mind, Body and Spirit Programs Wellness ProgramsACTIVE TREATMENT Managing Side Effects Side effects caused by cancer and cancer treatment can affect you physically, mentally and emotionally. Perhaps you are having trouble remembering things (known as \"chemo brain\") or feel more fatigued than usual. These experiences are normal; relieving these side effects is an important part of your cancer care. As you go through treatment, it may be helpful to track your symptoms and share them with your health care team so they can best manage them. Organizations, such as the American Cancer Society and Cancer.net, have useful tools to track this information. The use of complementary therapies during treatment can also be helpful. Therapies that reduce pain and help you cope with treatment-related side effects include meditation, reflexology, massage and yoga. Talk with your health care team before starting any therapies to make sure you are safely combining the therapies that are right for you. Coping with Self-Image and Uncertainty The side effects of cancer treatment can change how you feel about your appearance. It is normal to develop anxiety around the uncertainty of what to expect. You may experience positive and negative changes to your self-image. During this time, it's important to remember to be kind to yourself and allow time to grieve physical losses and adjust to your new body. A few ways to cope are attending support groups, journaling to record your thoughts and feelings, trying relaxation techniques (meditation, yoga, deep breathing), remaining active and engaging in social activities. You can also discuss possible reconstructive surgery, prosthetic devices and cosmetic solutions. Don't be afraid to talk with your family, loved ones and health care team about your concerns. Open communication will help them know how to best support you. Financing Treatment No matter how secure you feel financially, cancer treatment is expensive and presents a major financial challenge. Understanding your costs upfront is important to help identify the resources you may need to avoid financial toxicity (distress). Many national and local organizations offer financial assistance for general living expenses, housing, medical bills and medications to help ease the financial burden. Some are based on your cancer type, where you live or other demographics. Speak with your oncology social worker or health care provider for referrals to support services and financial resources. Coping with daily financial responsibilities may feel overwhelming but creating a financial plan can help to reduce stress, so that you can focus on your health and well-being. Some specially designed programs can help those in active treatment: COVID-19 Vaccine and Cancer Patients \u2014 page 2 Managing Radiation Side Effects \u2014 page 2 Managing Chemotherapy Side Effects \u2014 page 2 Managing Financial Toxicity and the Cost of Cancer Care Treatment \u2014 page 3 Nutrition and Cancer: Facts vs. Myths \u2014 page 6 Simply Beautiful Hair and Skin \u2014 page 7 Treatment for cancer is complex, and managing all the different aspects of treatment can be stressful.
