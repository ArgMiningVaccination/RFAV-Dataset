[Page III](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/5) P RL FA C:E. SINCE the issue of the last edition of this work, many and very important discoveries have been made in Homeopathy, especially in the treatment of children, a sphere of medical action, particularly suited for domestic practice. New remedies and new methods of treatment have been introduced, facilitating thereby the cure as well as lessening the danger of diseases. The Author, desirous of communicating the knowledge of these new discoveries to the non-professional public as early as possible, has embodied them in the present new edition of his work. As they thus appear for the first time in a book on Domestic Practice (no other similar work having as yet presented them), he feels it his duty to assure the non-professional reader, that these new remedies and methods of treatment, as produced in this edition, have all been fully and most satisfactorily tested in his own practice, before he offered them to the public. Of new remedies the author has introduced Cedron, perhaps the most important remedy in the treatment of fever and ague; also Ledum pal., highly useful in various diseases of the skin, (iii) [Page IV](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/6) iv PREFACE. and above all Chelidonium, indispensable in affections of the lungs and liver, particularly in inflammations of the lungs in children. These three remedies will be found in the list of medicines while two others less important have been omitted, so that the number of remedies has been increased only by one. Another improvement, not contained in any other domestic work, has been made in this edition; it is a separate and more complete treatise on Domestic Seirgery with illustrations. This was considered almost an indispensable addition to a work, which at present has acquired such a wide and extensive circulation, not alone in cities where a need of this kind might be felt less, but especially in the country, where surgical assistance can not be obtained so readily, or still more as the companion of emigrant families to the far regions of the West, or on board ocean-vessels. To the fourth British edition of this work a similar treatise has already been appended and its usefulness fully tested. In the chapters on \"Diseases of TVomen and Children,\" the reader will find very important additions and alterations; in the treatment of children the improvements are most manifest. The Author has also added an article on the \"Science of Medicine,\" in which he gives an historical synopsis of medicine as an art, and in showing its advancement to a science, develops the elements, from which as such it necessarily has to proceed. In doing this, he had to touch upon Hydropathy, as an indispensable adjunct to medical science, and since he was [Page V](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/7) PREFACE. V the first who introduced Hydropathic appliances in Homoeopathic domestic manuals, this article is intended to establish theoretically the reason, and vindicate the necessity of a combination, which has proved to be practically already so beneficial. In almost every chapter the reader will find alterations and add(itions; the latter in the whole book amount to nearly one hundred and fifty pages. This, of course, had to increase the cost of the book; but it is presumed that the great increase of its intrinsic value will far out-weigh the trifle of its increased cost. One case of sickness, more successfully treated than heretofore, will amply compensate the reader for the outlay of the former as well as the present price of the book. A marked improvement in the style of publication will be apparent to the most unpracticed eye: in this the publishers furnish further evidence that their mammoth manufacturing establishment contains facilities, not surpassed in any city of the Union for producing books neatly and substantially. THE AUTITHOR. CINCINNATI, September, 1857. [Page VI](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/8) PREFACES TO THE FIRST AND FOLLOWING EDITIONS. THE author well recollects that the first 1\"domestic physicians\" which appeared, were looked upon with distrust by some of the profession. But the people in general hailed them as welcome friends in their domestic afflictions, where counsel is so often needed at times when medical aid can not be obtained. At this time scarcely one homoeopathic family is without one or more books on domestic practice, which is a sufficient evidence of their practical utility. Thus have these messengers of mercy and usefulness traveled with, and often ahead of, the regular practitioners of IHomoeopathy-the silent, but efficient missionaries of truth, declaring it every where by facts and conquests over disease, won by the people themselves. The profession in general seems now to regard them as necessary allies in the great work of reforming the medical state of the world, and bestows a great deal of care on their constantly increasing perfection, by making thenl more practical and definite, progressing in their improvement as the science itself progresses. In this spirit the present volume is written and given to the public by the author, who has attempted to embody in it the results of a practice of more than sixteen years. In the pathology of the work he has followed mostly the views of Hufeland, who is generally practically useful, and of Schoenlein, who is precise and scientific. In the therapeutics he has endeavored to consult the best authors of our school, carefully comparing their views with his own results, which are embodied in this work. To increase its general usefulness, popular treatises of Anatonmy, Physiology, Hygiene. and Hydropathy, have been added; branches and parts of medical science as a whole, which, when properly understood and digested by the people, will in a great degree aid in promoting the salutary results expected from the use of a domestic physician. Beside this, a condensed extract of the Homceopathic Materia Medica, given at the close of the book, enables the reader to correct his prescriptions, and enlarge his general knowledge of the homoeopathic science. Thus it is hoped that, by these additions, the work is rendered more perfect in a twofold manner; first, by giving a more extended knowledge of the human system and its laws through (vi) ~~~~~C~and e~l~ -- u.; \u2014u449~~-.~i~i~ [Page VII](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/9) PREFACES TO THE FIRST AND FOLLOWING EDITIONS. vii the treatises on Anatomy and Physiology; and, secondly, by making the reader acquainted with those practical branches of medicine Hygiene and Hydropathy, of which, particularly, the latter has, within the last few years, very much engrossed the attention of the profession and of invalids. In this respect the author himself does not hesitate to declare that he considers Hydropathy, applied within her proper limits, the handmaid of Homceopathy, and that these two, combined in this relationship, are destined to conquer the medical world. In the conscientious desire of condensing in this edition as much as possible of practical usefulness, the author has developed still further, what was summarily touched upon in the previous editions, the use of water as an auxiliary to the strictly medicinal treatment of disease. This, it is generally admitted, when properly applied, materially aids the effects of Homoeopathic remedies, and though the author feels that Hydropathy is but the handmaid of Homceopathy, yet the introduction of the different beneficial modes of applying water into a work of this description, can not fail to meet with the approbation of those for whose use it is prepared. Those unacquainted with the application of water in disease, will find in the treatise on Hydropathy such general explanations, as are necessary to guide them; while under the head of the different diseases, in which it may be beneficially applied. the more specific directions will be found following the remedial treatment. No one can deny, that the works on Domestic Practice have been highly useful in favoring a spirit of medical reform, by introducing homneopathic medication; their increasing demand, at least, shows the necessity of their important mission, widely disseminating, as they do, the beneficient doctrines of our beloved healing art, and facilitating their application. In order to discuss more fully the various relations of a sound physical and moral development of Females, together with a more minute description and treatment of their diseases, the Author, to accomplish the highly important object, has since issued a separate work, under the title of \"WoMAN'S MEDICAL GUIDE,\" intended to be a supplement to his \"DoMESTIC PHYSICIAN.'

NOTICE TO HIIOMJEOPATIHtIC PHARMACEUTISTS, It will be observed that in this \" Domestic Physician,\" Cohfea, Belladonna and Cina, are used in two preparations-the third and the two hundredth. The latter has cc, attached to it, as Belladonna cc, showing, in the Roman numerals, the potency. It is expected that the preparations of these latter for the boxes are made in the greatest purity and genuineness. They can be procured all ready in every large city of the Union. The potencies of all the other remedies are designed for those from the mineral and animal kingdom in the sixth, and for those from the vegetable kingdom in the third potency. The tinctures mentioned in the \"' List of MIedicines\" should accompany the boxes.' ISPECIAL NOTICE FOR THIS EDITION._ Homceopathic Pharmaceutists will please observe, that in the \"List of Medicines,\" several, contained in former editions, have been omitted, while new ones were introduced, one more in number than heretofore. falbacum and Aloes are left out; second dilution, and Ledusn have been added. Calendula tincture has taken the place of SyiZphytum, omitted. [Page XVIII](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/20) INTROD UCTION. To aid in the search for the proper place in the work, where a disease may be found, its different popular names have always been given, and carefully recorded in the index. Should, however, the identification of a disease be difficult or doubtful, it is only necessary to refer, in the book, to the divisions made as to the parts of the system which are affected, such as \"Affections of the Head, Chest,\" etc., where all the ailments of these parts are generally put together. But there will scarcely ever arise a difficulty in this respect; the index has been made very complete, in view of saving the reader time and unnecessary vexation. If a disease is found, it is expected that everything will first be read which is said concerning it in the article, before a selection of a remedy is made; at the end of each article, the proper direction as to administration, diet, and regimen, is given. Wherever the attention is directed to the perusal of the Materia Medica, in treating on certain remedies, the medicine in question must be looked for in the Materia Medica, and its symptoms carefully compared with those of the patient. If in the directions for diet the reader is advised to adhere to the usual homceopathic diet- in chronic diseases, etc., he will find its rules specified in the following pages, under \"Dietetic _R/les.\" It is necessary to give an explanation in regard to several remedies, whose names will be found different in this work fiom those used in other similar works. Of the various been used, and Wh'enever this is mentioned, under the name of -'}ercury, the iiercriutoS vvvts is understood by it. This was done for the salke of not uninecessarily confusinfg the reader witl two different, namres for mercurial preparations, which o are essentially tLhe same in their effects and use. On that account the Mercurtius sublirnat. has been left out entirely. Its use is, at any rate, confined to one disease only (the dysentery), in the treatment of which the i.Merctzurius vivus supplies its place completely. On the other hand, three remedies, Coffea, Belladonna, and Cina, appear in two diffierent preparations in the book, the one commonly used bearing the simple nanme, while the twohundredth potiency of these remedies has a c-C. attached to them, showirng in the Roman numnera-ls the degree of potency. Although a gm1reat many more remedies could have been treated in the samne rnlner, it was not thought advisable to burden the book \u2014. wituh imore therapeutical detail, as it might interfere withl its oteher simple and practical arranogements. These three remedies, however, in their higher potencies, seeimed to be almost indispensable, in a useful work of this kind, as their effects, wlien properly indicated, cannot well be produced by their lower aittenuations. We invite particular attention to t1he use of Cina;, in the nervous worm symptoms, so frequently experienced in children, in nightly attacks, which quickly disappear after the exhibition of one or two doses of Cinm'a. Every homteopathic practitioner can soon satisfy himself in regard to the efficiency of the highest potencies, by inaking the above trial. In regard to our views on the preference of higher or lower attenuations, we would remark, that we consider homceopathically legitimate and practically useful, all potencies, from the mother tincture ad first trituration up to the highest dilution, but that we do not use one exclusively or all indiscriminately. Practical observation and theoretical researches have guided [Page XX](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/22) XX INTRODUCTION. 1us ill applying the various attenuations with real benefit, w\\lich is lno, so (ificult as many practitioners might believe. Tlhere are principles according to whilh the different potenciess of a remedy must be applied in different cases. But to enlarge upon this subject here, would carry us too far; we content ourselves by remarking that, for a domestic familychest, we would propose, as a general rule, the third potency for all vegetable medicines, and the sixth potency for all mineral and animal medicines. If this rule was once adopted by all writers on homceopathic domestic practice, their several works might be used with benefit without subjecting the public to additional expense in procuring different medicinechests for the works of different authors. For a successful treatment of diseases, everything depends, after the selection of the right, or most homceopathic remedy, on the genuineness of its preparl-tion. We would, therefore, advise our readers to procure their medicine-chests from persons whose competency or recommendations can be relied on; and when in their possession, to take good care of them. The vials must not be opened except whlen used; each vial must receive its own cork ag'ain, and no odorous medicinal substances must be allowed to be near by, when a vial is opened or medicine is taken. If a remedy is prescribed to be taken in water, a clean cup or tumbler must be selected, the prescribed quantity of water, either rain or river water poured in, then the medicine added, and, during its solution, well mixed with a clean teaspoon, and afterward covered well. If more medicines than one are prescribed at a time, in water, each one must be dissolved separately in a teacup, and each one receive its own separate teaspoon, which must not be changed during the administration of the medicine. If a vial is empty, it is indispensably necessary, before refilling it, to cleanse it first thoroughly with warm water and dry it perfectly on a stove or in the sun, before the homceopathic apothecary is allowed to fill it. Persons ought to [Page XXI](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/23) INTRODUCTION. XXi attend to this scrupulously themselves, before presenting them foir refillin'o; because much depends on it, as regards the (Ileuineness of the medicines. bThe medicines should be kept in a dry place, where no oicrs cain 1reach them. A renewal of their strength, if well ke{pt, is not necessary for years; but if the slightest doubt in this respect should arise, it is better to have it renewed. [Page 22](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/24) THE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE. THERE is a striking similarity in the process of development in the different sciences, which have sprung into life by the unceasing efforts of the human mind. Even if the tendencies are ever so various, they bear to each other in the process of development a striking resemblance, exhibiting in that respect a unity of origin and growth in the moral and intellectual sphere analogous to the one, we find in the physical world which is governed by few, but universal laws. The reason for this singular coincidence, will be found in the identity of their fundamental structures, resting alike upon truth, order and harmony. The physical world, as well as the moral, are reared upon this same foundation, extending as it does throughout the Universe, as far and deep as our eyes with telescope and microscope can penetrate, or our minds in furthest reaching thought can carry us. Truth, order and harmony prevail every where in the physical world; where we don't find them, we may be certain that the fault lies in a deficiency of knowledge or perception on our part. Our duty, therefore, is still to pursue our investigations until we have found the sacred trio, and thus have obtained a revelation of new glories. In the moral and intellectual sphere, the same obstacles are encountered and the same glorious results are obtained. Politics for instance, before it could be called a science, had to struggle for thousands of years, during which immense lapse of time, the whole human race had been engaged (22) [Page 23](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/25) THE SCIENCE OF MIEDICINE. 23 in its construction, without any apparent progress or even hope of final success. From the earliest dawn of history to the glorious morning of the Fourth of July'76, man had spent his moral, intellectual and physical strength to solve this one scientific problem; in the political histories of an hundred powerful nations, whose life and action fill this mighty chasm of time, nothing is presented to the scrutinizing eye but one continued, awful and sublime struggle after that divine trio of political science, truth, order and harmony. What an immense expense of human action, thought and suffering during these thousands of years, was necessary to produce that wonderful combination of truth, order and harmony, as presented to us in that small document, the \"Declaration of Independence.\" Consider for a. moment, that four thousand years of political suffering and struggle had to prepare the human mind for the scientific and right solution of this subject. Kingdoms and vast empires were raised and destroyed, great heroes fought and perished, giant minds, such as the world never has seen since, contributed their energies and suffering; still politics remained a chaotic field of unsuccessful experiments; it had not be. come a science because truth, order and harmony were still wanting; yet, these four thousand years were not spent in vain; without their experience and lessons, the Fourth of July,'76, never could have dawned. But as soon as the political rights of man were fully understood, boldly declared, and successfully maintained, the chaotic mass of historical data, during the preceding centuries, began to range itself intelligibly; political truth became self-evident, and with order in its train, proved itself to be in perfect harmony with other truths, revealed and natural. To show the immense difference between old and new politics (as we term, for convenience sake, all foreign in opposition to American politics) let us examine for a moment their workings in the art or method of colonization, which is a partof political economy. The Phoenician colonized, but his aim in doing so was not [Page 24](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/26) 24 THE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE. strictly political; it was as yet merely commercial. The Greeks succeeded in founding colonies, but could not retain them. Rome forccd her colonies upon near and distant countries, but was obliged to exhaust her power in keeping them in submission, and thus to hasten her own downfall. Spain colonized, until she herself became poor, miserable and despised. EDgland founded colonies more easily than any power previously, yet when compared with the rapidity of American colonization, its efforts sink into utter insignificance. The political organization of an English colony is unwieldy and heavy, and can not, therefore, increase with great rapidity in wealth and population. The American system, however, allows of the quickest and most harmonious development of all nationalities and individualities, the colony herself becoming an integral portion of the nation. A State springs up as by nmagic, perfect in all its parts; it grows rapidly, and, in a short time, has gained a power and energy not possessed frequently by States of the growth of centuries. Such is the difference between scientific and chaotic politics. The same development of truth, order and harmony prevails in the moral and religious sphere of the human mind, after it has wrung itself out of a chaotic state of confusion into that of law and principle. Here, where even the Divine light of revelation had been shed for thousands of years, and the most glorious intellects had striven to find the truth, it remained weak and misunderstood, until the days of Luther and the reformers. Then at once, and with tremendous power, did it penetrate the old chaotic mass, organizing and giving life as it advanced. Again, look at the science of Astronomy, as it now appears beautifully developed in symmetry, precision and truth; compare it with the Astronomy before Kepler and Newton, who as the first infused science into its tcachings; even the announcement of the Solar system by Copernicus, giving the true position of the sun and each planetary orb, was not sufli [Page 25](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/27) THE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE. 25 cient to entitle Astronomy to wear the name of a science; it as yet was without its life-giving laws. These were found by Kepler and Newton. But even Kepler's three laws, although mighity truths, would have been quite powerless to propel Astronomy toward the perfection of the science it now is, if Newton's great law of gravity had not been discovered, giving them thus efficiency and power of developing truth after truth, until we are dazzled with the splendor which scientific Astronomy reveals in the boundless universe. Great minds had lived and labored thousands of years before either Kepler or Newton; yet the combined result of their labors were insignificant, compared with what the four laws of these giant philosophers effected in a short time. Before their period, Astronomy was a chaos of experiences and doctrines; through their labors it became a science, in which truth, order and harmony reigned, and ever since its progress has been marvelous. Now let us contemplate the course which one of the most useful branches of human knowledge, the healing art, has taken; let us inquire whether it has been similar to those already mentioned, and whether it took also thousands of years of unceasing effort and trial, to prepare first its chaotic mass of experiences and doctrines, before it was possible for the creative power of genius to infuse life and science into it. As this contemplation touches nearer upon the very nature of our subject, we may be allowed to dwell more on its detail. From the nature of the healing art, we are led to believe that it must have been practiced, if ever so rudely, in the very beginning of hum-an society; they tried then, as well as now, to relieve bodily sufferings and cure diseases. The first effort, however, recorded in history, to systematize medicine, was made by the Greeks, among whom Hippocrates, the Sage of Cos, was particularly famous. He is, therefore, rightly called the \" Father of Medicine.\" His principal object was to closely observe nature, collect facts, make experiments, and to record his own experience, or that of others, wherever he could. 3 [Page 26](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/28) 26 TIE SCIENCE OF IMEDICINE. This course was a decidedly judicious one, the only one which, on account of the then existing small store of medical knowledge, it was possible to pursue. His works left to us are, therefore, yet valuable, containing, as they do, nothing but facts, no vague hypotheses or surmises of a questionable u ature. His followers, however, soon began to depart from those sdfe rules which had guided the Sage of Cos; they made attempts to classify diseases and treat them according. to the latture of the causes, which they fancied to have found; tliiy invented names for diseases, as it suited their pre-concoivced notions, according to which, of course, the treatment A: d to take its shape. Any one taking such a system as the rule of therapeutical action, would find himself soon disui14-Mointed, therefore less averse to adopting another, if offered.'!,')se systems or schools of medicine rapidly succeeded one iaother in the lapse of centuries, every prominent doctor of tl e art attempting to be the founder of a new one. None of them, however, was based upon a law of cure, which alone could have insured its permanence. In its stead they consisted of fanciful theories, as to causes of diseases and their treatii:nt, which, like ignes fatiui, bewildered the searching mind, n h:le they shed but a dim light to guide his steps. Thus centuries passed; the healing art had not become a soience; the law of cure was not yet known. Thousands of lcarned men had spent their energies and lives to gain this one priceless jewel, but in vain; doubt and uncertainty remained. Those who had departed from nature, could not find out her secrets; the creations of their own phrenzy they mistook for true revelations of nature. Thus the medical world appeared at the end of the last century, a perfect chaos, opinions striving with opinions, without the least possibility of conciliation. The physicians at that time were unquestionably learned men as regards other branches of human knowledge; the accessory sciences of medicine, such as chemis [Page 27](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/29) TIHE SCIENCE OF MIE:DICINE. 27 try, anatomy, physiology, etc., were studied with great diligence, and brought to a high degree of perfection. But that which was most needed in medicine, the healing of the sick, was left to be guided, either by the fanciful theory of a learned doctor, or the pretensions of a shrewd empiric. Then it was that the illustrious Hahnemann arose, and first announced to the medical world the law of cure, which he discovered by closely observing and comparing the various operations of nature. It was no fanciful hypothesis of his own mind, but the result of calm and patient observation, aided by the powers of induction. Yet in such a state of confusion and distrust was the medical world at that time, that the simple truth of the new doctrine at first found but very few followers, who, rallying around Hahnemann, declared themselves willing to nurture this infant science, the genuine offspring of nature, into strength and usefulness. In doing so, they had to undergo labors, and subject themselves to trials, almost too severe to be borne; yet they suffered all for the sake of truth, order and harmony, which now was brought into the hitherto chaotic wilderness of medicine. But few choice minds engaged at first in the practice and propagation of the new doctrine; to them it opened treasures heretofore unknown, and held out in the future still richer promises, to the realization of which they continued to devote all their energies and talents. Hahnemann had become indeed the father of scientific medicine. His doctrine, in beautiful harmony with all the other known laws of nature, rapidly spread after its practical superiority once was fully demonstrated; the self-thinking, independent minds of the medical profession became its devoted adherents; and thus constituted themselves, from its former chaotic mass, into a separate concrete body, leaving their former brethren to be tossed about on the old ocean of medicine, by the fluctuating waves of uncertainty and doubt. There most of them still remain; careless or careworn, according to their several natuzrels; expecting yet to find a firm [Page 28](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/30) 28 THIlE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE. foot-hold among their chaotic confusion of doctrines, they plod along onl the old beaten track without joy or energy. The more learned portion of them, however, threatens to leave them: a second division of the great chaotic mass has to take place; these deserve a further notice, Seeing the errors of the old, heroic practice, and being unwilling to follow the law, \"similia sinmil'ibus,\" they start the idea that the nihilistic, or do-nothing method, is the only one which a learned medical gentleman ought to adopt. Accordingly, they advocate it to be the physician's highest duty never to give any medicine whatever, but to watch the efforts of nature in order to guard against any interference. They style themselves the ph.ysiological or pathological school, because their principal efforts concentrate in studying the phenomena of nature, either in health or disease. A third portion of the old chaotic mass, more inclined to energetic action and empirical routine, has been attracted in another direction, by the wonderful power which the cold water system has exhibited in curing diseases. This discovery was made by the ingenuity and perseverance of an unlearned peasant, at a time when the world boasted of a more splendid galaxy of renowned medical names than it had ever heretofore. Yet their stars faded before the rising light of truth, heralded by the simple farmer of Graeffenberg. Soon the cold-water treatment was baptized by the learned apostates from the old school ranlks. and received the more classically sounding title of Hydropathy. Its adherents, denouncing all drug medication as nefarious and almost criminal, founded a complete system of medicine of their own. Their tendency is not to establish and develop a law of cure, as Homoeopathy has done, by the application of which certainty and scientific precision will prevail; but they strive with severe and unceasing efforts to make the water subservient to all curative purposes, and to create through it a universal remedy, which by the difference of application, reaches the divers diseases. [Page 29](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/31) THE SCIENCE OF 2fEDICINE. 29 Thus the medical world, which, sixty years ago, still formed one chaotic mass, void of form but full of useful elements and seeds of promise, is divided now into three great concrete parts, each of which tries to enlarge itself from without by elaborating within the powers of attraction. Let us contemplate for a moment their different positions, in order to prognosticate their future. The physiological or do-nothing school, does not really pretend to cure a disease; but merely to watch its natural progress without interfering; they affect to be the high priests of nature, clothed with the robes of her pontifical dignity, in which capacity they pronounce nature's will. It seems not to be part of their duty, to alleviate the poor patient's sufferings; that would be an invasion of nature's right. Nature will do that herself, if she can; and if not, no power on earth can relieve the sufferer or divert the fatal shaft; no medicine exists, to assist nature or to cure disease. Such reasoning is at once the death of science, and if it does not immediately cause the death of the patient, it certainly is not calculated to avert it. We can not, therefore, expect that this school will have a prosperous future; its increase can not come from any other source than that remnant of the old chaotic mass, which still clings to old doctrines and doses, satisfied with the small share of usefulness attending their operations. Its attention is more particularly directed to the most minute pathological and physiological investigations, which in their eyes constitute the sumwinum bozomun of medical wisdom. While these efforts are in the highest degree praiseworthy, and also practically useful their apotheosis leads to the most dangerous consequences, to a complete apathy of healing the sick and relieving the sufferer. A system so devoid of medical action, can not exist long; it has no germs of development, and must cease to draw the attention of the thinking practitioner toward it, as soon as the discoveries in the physical sciences, [Page 30](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/32) 30 TIE SCIENCE OF 51EDICiNE. so mauny and 7wonderful of late, diminish in fr.e(qelCecy and novelty. This school, therefore, not havingr any lit:rture, but what cOntains only matter of general interest in physiolooy or pathology, soon will disappear, and its present adherents (mo3t of thern are to be found in Europe) will join either of the remaining parties; tile frtuits of its physical researches, however, as a permanent treasure, Will not be lost to science, but b-come practi-ally useful; the Homoeopathists already use the stethoscope and microscope with the greatest benefit in the application of medicine. The next party, which attracts our attention, are the Htydropathists, who separated from the old system about the same time. They claim to cure disease and mitigate suffering; they point out to us their remedy, its different modes of application, and cures which they have effected. We are obliged to believe them; they come to us well authenticated and in great abundance; they are also genuine cures, wrought by the agency of water, in its different methods of application, as laid down in the works on ETydropathy. Its adherents have already formed a literatture of their own, discarding drug-treatment, and relying solely on the vis medicatrix, which they arouse into critical action and support by water alone. The time has passed, where success of this kind, could be ignored with safety. or a proper regard for honesty of purpose. The duty of the physician is to cure disease and relieve suffering; to do this best and easiest, he has to look around for the proper means. If these are afforded to him, he is morally bound to investigate their claims. This is a rational principle of action for every one, but particularly for the physician. He must take cognizance of the fact, that many and severe diseases are cured under the water treatment; to deny its efficiency, tlherefore, as a curative means of the highest order, would be foolish and useless. Willing or not, we must look these facts in the face, and instead of denying, rather try to explain them. It is true, the latter is the most difficult of the two, but honor, [Page 31](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/33) TrIHE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE;: interest and benevolence are powerful stimuli to overcome the diffilult task. Thle water-cure has its enemies, as well as any nIew doctrine, which at first disturbs the balance of old notions: the most noisy of them, however, are those who fear its success, either from want of confidence in themselves, apprehendinZ a diminution of the little fame already acquired, or from iiisuffi;licnt knowledge of their own principles, the strength of whi.hh they underrate if they fear competition. We shotil l not act thus meanly, to the lasting disgrace of ourselves, al-.l to the prejudice of humanity, whose dearest interests we prof ss to serve. If we can not as yet perhaps explain fully, why wat,l is a curative means, or bring its therapeutical use within t}le; strict limits of our homoeopathic law, it does not follow tl zat we should refrain from using it in the treatment of diseasi.l. Partly, at least, water cures homoeopathically, particularil where its different temperatures, when prescribed, are similar to those in the patient. For instance, the cure of habitual cold feet by the cold footbath, frozen limbs by snow and i. e the application of warm water to heads, heated by a congesti,, of the blood, etc. Homoeopathical also is the effect of the wr bandage, applied in local congestions in different parts of tlt body. because the warmth, created by re-action, acts homeeop. thic on the heated parts affected, and dispels congestion These applications, although the minor ones in the water-cu C make it highly useful in private practice; the strictest homen - pathist can not find fault with them, and he will find them o' the greatest service, if applied at the same time with his i{ medics, whose specific action they will support. The effect of the more severe operations in the water-cu' the wet sheet, and full bath and douche, however. can not 1, explained on the principle similia similibuts; yet these at_ the methods by which the severest chronic diseases are cure and often those despaired of by all other systems. As v; no explanation of these cures, to satisfy science, has bee made; to reject the use of the wet sheet on this groun' [Page 32](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/34) 32 THE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE. would be very wrong and even unphilosophical. Because, if we thus should act in all cases, people ought to have refused breathing the air or partaking of food, up to the time that Liebig first made known the true action of air and food in warming our bodies. We ought to be satisfied at pescntb with the fact that severe chronic diseases arc often curable tby water; the mlodus oe'rancli imay be yet obscure; still, in due time, it will also be found out. Meanwhile we should avail ourselves of the blessing thus far granted to us, and in doing so. we also have the best opportunity to arrive nearer to the solution of this important problem. Until this is done, every one is at liberty to have his own opinion on this subject. I am satisfied that neither our homocopathic law, nor the crude ideas of the old humoral pathology can give a satisfalctory explanation; to have this, we must look in another direction, where neither the one nor the other took its point of departure. We will contemplate this new field of investigation for this purpose. The microscope has disclosed new worlds, which formerly lay hidden to the knife of the Anatomist, and of course were inaccessible to the Physiologist and Pathologist. We now know, that organic life, at first resides in the cell, whose development produces the different tissues, which are the basis of the formation of organs. A cell is a closed sac or vesicle, whose walls are composed of a delicate membrane, and containing a fluid whose contents may vary in. character; they sometimes contain also a so-called nucleus. This latter, although not present in every cell, is always found, however, where a formative process is going on, in which case it is supposed to exercise a catalytic action, disposing the cell-walls to changes, which produce the tissues and the subsequent changes within them. T here is a material difference between cell-walls and nucleus-the former being soluble, the latter insoluble in acetic acid. Each cell, therefore, consists of a complete living organism within itself. [Page 33](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/35) THE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE'. 33 Plant or animal is only an aggregate of millions of these living-h bodies, produced and sustained by the original germ or life-force. We have to look to this little cell as the originator of all organic structures, the source of their health and their disease. Because, we know, that where the seat of life is, there can only be the seat of disease. In disease, these cells change, and by necessary consequence their products also. Our duty is now, to observe the conditions and phenomena of cell-life, in order to find their laws of health and disease. In the economy of nature we find two laws most, prominently active, particularly where spheroid forms shall be produced or maintained, whose action at the same, time needs free motion. These laws are the centrifugal and centripetal, by whose counteracting forces all spheroid bodies are kept together and in motion. This arrangement in nature has reference to the greatest as wyell as smallest bodies, and it seems to be the link between the inorganic and organic, or the nearest approach of the former to the latter, which in its higher forms is sustained by the life-force. A cell is the most primitive organic form, just emerged from the inorganic plasma, and its life thus far may be maintained by virtue of the centrifugal and centripetal forces, the former resting in its walls. the latter in its nucleus, both being in constant antagonistic action, the equilibrium of which constitutes health, while its disturbance engenders disease. The force of the center or nucleus is presumed to contain the formative or crystalizing power and tends to arrest motion, while the peripheric fiorce contained in the cell-walls, produces extension and diffusion, tending to create an excess of motion, if not checked by the proper counteraction of the center. If this view should be found correct, its application in physiology and pathology may be of some consequence, as it would at once guide our researches by the microscope, and give definiteness to pathological distinctions. [Page 34](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/36) 3J1 THE SCIENCE O(F 1MEDICINE. Again, organic life manifests itself in the constant exchange of waste and increase of material; without this necessary process; death either partial or complete, would ensue. Such a process pie-supposes, however, the parts, thus in action, to be in constant motion, and to be so, they must be kept in such a degree of fluidity, as will allow and facilitate this exchange of matter. For this purpose all organic bodies are composed mostly of liquids-and water, which penetrates the whole organism like a sponge. This obtains in all organic bodies. the difference being only in degree. As a law, it also appears in the growth of germs, the development of which can not take place, except under the presence of a certain amount of moisture. This we may consider, therefore, as an essential condition of the display of vital force, or as one of the laws of life. The harmonious exchange of matter in the organism constitutes health; its retention or excess produces disease.These processes, however, take place, where all life-action displays itself, in cell structures. If, by some interference, their locomotion is impeded, or in their organic formation as regards wall and nucleus, disturbances have been occasioned, disease must inevitably follow. Medical agency now has to restore the original harmony in cell-structure and cell-motion. The two-fold composition of the cell, its motive force resting in its walls, and its formative principle residing in the nucleus, seems to require a two-fold medical action, corresponding to the two cell-forces. My opinion is, that the specjfic lct,uc, \"simiiiia si;a'i[ibrrs,\" reaches in its curative effect the center of the cell, controlline the formative or crystalizing processes, and changing the:n by specific action. Other means are however needed to influence the locomotive power of the cell, and this is clone by water, entering into its walls, and by fir.cti;on or 11'sc'.lart' exercise, which dissolves the adhesion of cells, and sets thinm by that means into motion again. It will be necessary to [Page 35](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/37) THIIE SCIENCE OF BIEDICINE. 35 remark, that the specific or homoecopathic process is of a clearly dynamllic nl:ture; the water cure and movement cure have a decided material or mechanical direction. They are all equally needed, because all organiz\"ation is based on either substratum dynamic, as well as mechanical. The dynamic process can only to a certain extent overcome mechanical barriers, as we see in the electro magnetic engine, which besides its own weight, can scarcely be said to possess power to overcome severe friction. Tro do this, mechanical force is needed to overcome mechanical impediment. The same holds good in the organism, when the stagnation of molecular force has arrived at a point, where dynamic action is not able to overcome it. In such cases the solvent or melting qualities of the water will set the molecular apparatus into motion again, free it of retentions, and, thus quickening the moulting process, prepare the organism again for receiving specific impressions of the dynamic agent, if any disease beyond the control of water is still present. These processes may frequently be carried on at the same time in the system, assisting each other, and not interfering with each other in the least. We will explain this proposition more clearly by applying its rule in two of the most frequent pathological actions, viz: CONGESTION-INFLAIMMATION.-Hyperemia., or excess of blood in one or more parts of the system, is a distinguishing sign of congestion as well as inflammation: in the former it may exist with diminished motion, properly called congestion, or with increased motion signalized by the name of determination of blood. The term inflammation in particular signifies an Hyperlemia in certain parts of the body, with an altered action and condition of the vessels in those parts; the motion of the blood, partly increased or partly diminished, is always labored, hard, as it struggling through obstruction. The principal outward signs, by which inflammation is distinguished, are redness, heat, paint and swellieng. Although [Page 36](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/38) 36 THE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE. these signs are very frequently produced also by congestion and determination of the blood, yet they are less intense and continued, than when caused by inflammation; besides the latter process differs from both the former, in the retarded or arrested flow of the blood, in the vessels of those parts. Inflammation may be the result of congestion and determination of the blood, comprising both these morbid elements, without being identical with them, because it is connected with an altered condition of the bloodvessels exhibiting morbid products. We can, therefore, say, -\"the most essential character of inflammation, consists in an increased motion or determination of blood to the affected part, with a more or less obstructed flow through the part;\". this latter is caused by the increased production of the lymph corpuscles, adhering to the walls of the vessels, or to one another, this being the real cause of the obstructed flow of blood in inflammation, which in simple congestion, or determination of the blood, is not the case. It is further evident, that the vascular system is the essential seat of these processes; however, doubtful, it may be, yet whether a previous affection of the nervous system is always needed to produce them; in most of the cases their dynamic origin can not be denied. On this latter important fact their successful treatment, with Homoeopathic remedies is based and it is one of the most glorious triumphs of specific medication, to have arrived at a direct and scientific method of curing these disorders. Wherever they may appear in the system, single or combined, in a light or aggravated form, Homceopathy meets their variously exhibited symptoms fearlessly, curingi them mostly with success. This curative process needs no further elucidation here; its details are ta.ught and discussed when treating on the various forms of diseases, of which the above morbid elements form principal parts. But not so often do we find it mentioned, that although Homooop},thic mledication iemoves the primary or dynamic cause of inflammation, etc., its immediate [Page 37](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/39) TIHE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE. 37 effect on the vascular system, the swelling, pain and heat could be ameliorated, and palliated at the same time by the application of cold or warm water, without interfering in the least with the specific action of the medicine. To this fact we want to draw the attention of the practitioner most especially, as being of the utmost practical importance: and we would suggest to him, from the explanation of these morbid processes, as above given, the necessity and propriety of extending the use of water to all of them, wherever they may make their appearance in the various diseases. If in a swollen and inflamed breast or boil, the application of water or other soothing applications, is beneficial and of old standard notoriety, it ought to be not less so in an inflamed or congested liver, spleen or lung, there being no essential difference between the character of all these affections. That water has heretofore not been more freely used, when organs of vital importance were inflamed or congested, was owing to the then unsatisfactory physiological knowledge of these processes, and their rude and unscientific Allopathic treatment. But since the microscope and animal chemistry have corrected our opinions in this respect, and undoubtedly proved that many a process heretofore considered as primary or productive of others, might be taken as secondary or produced by others, we should not now any longer hesitate to apply water whenever indicated, as the principal solvent of solids and carrier off of effete matter. In the same manner, only by mechanical friction, does the movement cure set free the retained molecule, and thus prepares the organism for the reception of specific medicine, if disease is still left after its use. What dynamic action alone could not do, namely, to overcome mechanical derangement of molecular bodies, water and movement or exercise, are well qualified to do, and in this consists their invaluable aid; they give a completeness to the science of medicine, perfecting as it were, its code, and thereby allowing the whole field of nature's actions to be reached by the forces of medication. [Page 38](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/40) 38 TfFTHEE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE. In this light we have presented the relation of these new forces, which seem to be destined to bless the suffering world in a degree hitherto unknown, when linked together and understandingly practiced. Each one separate will of course be able to produce upon its own legitimate field, a great deal of good, but it will still be partial and limited, when compared with the good, which united they are able to produce. Party feeling as we have seen, has created strict party lines, to keep them asunder, but their common interest in the service of humanity demands their union. Hydropathy as a separate system, rejecting all specific medication, can not exert that salutary influence. which it does united to a system, satisfying scientific demands as above explained. In vain will the Ultra-Hydropathist strive to make his system reign supremely; it lacks universality of application and specific force; it can not meet the demands, as they appear anew from time to time on the changing theater of the organic world. At the same time the Ultra-Homoeopathist will be forced to countenance the curative power of water, and will halve to allow its introduction into the medical treasury for daily use. the same he will have to do as regards movement cure. If thus a union of these three most effective methods is realized a complete revolution in medical matters must be the result; medical success will be increased, until disease will be almost annihilated, and death retarded to its natural limits. May the time speedily come, when these invaluable forces will not any more struggle single-handed against that manyheaded monster, disease, which lurks within and feeds upon the very life of mankind; but where they will be united in one phalanx, Homoeopathy at the head, and the Water, and Movement Cure to support its beneficent actions. [Page 39](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/41) DIETETIC RULES. TrIE observance of a strict diet is essential to the success of a homoeopathic treatment, not so much on account of the injury done to the system by the use of improper articles, as because these might be antidotal in their effects to the medicine. On this account, homoeopatllists so generally forbid coffee, it l)eing an antidote to most of their remedies. For the same reason, the use of all other things of a mledicinal nature is strictly forbidden, such as spices, perfumeries, perfumed waters, soda waters, spiced ices, etc. It is a gceneral law of nature, to eat and drink only that which can sustain life, without producing any other effects, that is, simple nutriment; and as medicinal and spicy substances, althioughll sometimes nutritious, are irritating and stimulating, the strict law of nature excludes theim peremptorily from the daily use (see \"Hygiene\"). )iet in Acute Diseases.-As dietetic rules are given for each acute disease, separately throughout the book, it is not necessary to mention them in this place.

If thle patient has symptoms of fever or irritation, in any part of the system, lie must avoid all articles of a stimulating character, such as meats, eggs, and butter. In such cases, he should confine himself to a nutritious vegetable diet, such (39) [Page 40](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/42) 40 DIETETIC RULES. as potatoes, turnips, rice, barley, etc. If the disease appears mostly in thle digestive organs, as a clhronic diarrhea, all articles of a relaxing' nature are in themselves injurious, such as fruits and other green vegetables, soups of meat, eggs, etc. In cases where constipation is present, the opposite course nmust be pursued. Another consideration is, that articles of food, which disagree with tihe patient, although allowed or wholesome for others under similar circumstances, must be strictly avoided by him.

Moderate exercise in the open air, as, also, a careful observance of all other hygienic rules (see the article on Hygiene) is strongly recommended.

GENERAL DISEASES. REMARKS. iN this chapter we intend to treat of those diseases which do not spend the force of their attacks on any single organ, or set of organs, but whose cause has such a general relation to all the organs and tissues of the system, that it can effect them either singly or simultaneously according to the nature of the attack. In separating this class of diseases, we have facilitated the grouping of other diseases, having a more local character, under their respective organs, and thus the non-professional reader is enabled immediately to find the desired reference by turning to the description of diseases, peculiar to the organ affected at that time. It is evident that such a classification of diseases is of the greatest advantage in a treatise on Domestic Practice. Rheumatism, therefore, affecting the system so generally, had to have its placy under the head of \" General Diseases,\" while the different catarrhal affections could be more conveniently arranged under the organs, subject to their attack. Although fever is almost always present in rheumatic as well as catarrhal attacks, its presence is not an essential attribute of these diseases; but indicates only a higher and more important degree. The essential fevers, consequently, such as'I'yphus, etc., as also those called eruptive fevers, are treated of in separate chapters, where the reader will easily find them. (45) [Page 46](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/48) 46 GENERAL DISEASES. RHEUMIATIS8I. As to its general appearance, this disease is well known; it is, however, not so well understood as to its real cause, although its exciting cause is generally admitted to be a sudden suppression of the function of the skin. As this is, however, the case also in all catarrhal affections, those who cl;ssify them together and separate them only as to their different location, might be justified to do so. For practical purposes it is sufficient to know, that rheumatism attacks muscles, ligaments and serous membranes, while catarrhs affect only mucous membranes, especially those of the throat, nose, etc. DIAGNosIs.-Pains in the muscles and membranes, together with swelling of the surrounding cellular tissue, light redness, and heat; caused by having taken cold. This is the general appearance of all rheumatic affections; yet their degrees and complications are so numerous, that it would almost require a separate treatise to do justice to such an extensive subject. We confine ourselves, here, to the more practical subdivision of aculte and chronic rheumatism. Beside, we would remark that rheumatism, particularly in the acute form, can exist in any part of the system, creating there such an inflammation as the affected organ is naturally disposed to, adding to it only its own rheumatic character. For instance: a patient is attacked with rheumatism in the arms or limbs; this at once leaves those muscles, and falls on the pleura, where it generates a pleurisy, not of the usual kind, but one which has the rheumatic character \u2014a rheumatic pleurisy. In the same manner, we speak of rheumatic pneumonia, rheumatic inflammation of the eye, heart, etc. The best means to detect the rheumatic character, in cases of this kind, is to investigate whether the disease, in its acute form, has appeared after taking cold, by suppressing or disturbing the action of the skin, or, whether, in its chronic type, the changes of the atmosphere influence its severity. In [Page 47](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/49) ACUTrE OR 1 NFILAIIATORIY'RHLIEUMATISM'.. 47 suchl cases, we refer tile reader to the respective chapters, where tile diseases of these organs are specially treated.'I'liere exists an intrinsic difference between rheumatism and 5gout. (See this article.) To pr'event attacks of rheumatism and annihilate within us the predisposition to it, we must avoid all sudden changes of temperature and all excesses, which can create local and general debility. We ought to strengthen the system against injurious external influences, by cold washing and bathing,, by acquiring regularl habits, and following the rules, as laid down in the chapter on \"Hygiene.\" el. ACUTE OR INFLAMMATORY RIHEUMATISM. This form of rheumatism, especially, developes itself after taking cold, or after any check of perspiration, sldden and severe enough to unfit the whole skin for its proper function of exhalilng tile imperceptible gases. First, an uncomfortable sensation and restlessness will appear, followed by chilliness and feverishness in alternation, thirst, constipation, and acceleratedl pulse; then the rheumatic pains appear in places where they either fix themselves, creating swelling,, bheat, and redness, or wander to other parts, where they repeat the same process, while those first attacked heal gracdually and get well. In acute rheumatism, we sometimes find a dry skin; at other times, a very moist one, drenched with a watery perspiration, which does not relieve the patient. The perspiration, which will relieve the patient, is greasy, thick, glutinous, and smells acrid or sour. TREATMENT. \u2014Aconitze-In the beginning, when the fever is high, the skin dry and hot, with excessive thirst and redness of the cheeks; s/looting or tearing pains, worse at night and by the touch, extrenme ir'itability of temper. If this remedy, after having been applied for eight or ten hours, has mitigated the fever by producing general perspiration, yet the local pains remain in the muscles and joints, give, [Page 48](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/50) 48 GENERAL DISEASES. T yonia, in the same'manner, when the pains are worse by -:. {-on or at nig/2t, when there is headache, fever, swelling of. joints, and gastric derangement, with constipation. Alter-.scs well with Aconite or Rhus. (See this remedy.) Belladonna, when -Bryonia does not relieve, or when the tiairts are much swollen, very red, shining, and the patient is sleepless at night, complaining of dryness in the mouth and dlhoat, and congestion to the head. Both remedies may be given in alternation, with advantage. Chamomile, when, in the parts affected, there is a sensation of numbness or paralysis, worse at night, the patient is feverish, restless, agitated, irritable, trying to relieve himself by turning in the bed; the pains often ascend into the head, ears, and teeth, with chilliness and a bruised sensation after sleep. Arnica: Bruised or syprained sensation in the joints of the hands, feet, and in the small of the back, with hard, red and shining swelling; feeling of numbness and crawling in the affected parts; the pains are aggravated by motion; the pa-;ient is thirsty andi irritable (alternates well with Rhmus). N1ux vomica, in alternation with Chamomile, when the parts are numb, cold air aggravates, temper is irritalble, bowels constipated. The pains are principally located between the shoulder blades; in the small of the back, and in the loins. Pulsatilla-The same feeling of numbness and paralysis, but relieved by exposure to cool air, the patient wants to be uncovered, and is of a mild temper and whining mood, worse in the night; the pains have a great tendency to change places. ( Shfting or wcandering Rheumatism.) Mercury-pains increased in the heat of the bed, or toward morninv \u2014also, when the patient perspires profusely without being relieved by it. Lachesis suits well after Mlercury. Dizlcamara-in an attack of rheumatism which immediately follows a severe exposure to cold; the pains set in at night, are worse dui-ing repose, with but little fever. [Page 49](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/51) ACUTE ORl INFLA1M1MATOIRY RHEUMIATISM. 49 2fI?/s \u2014 principal indication for its use is: pains worse (turinq rest, or,as if' the flesh was torn from the bones; worse in coil, i i(.-p vact, er'. This remedy, when the latter a;.e..- present,, alternates well with YBryonia. (See Bilious Rlicumatic Affection.) It is, also, of great use, when there is 2waralytic weakness or trembling of the extremities, on moving them. N. B. See also the remedies, stated under \"Chronic Rheulmatism anld Gout,\" this being a similar affection. If th;e pains in the limbs should cease suddenly, followed soon by difficulty of breathing, anxiety, weakness, or pains in the region of the heart, with violent palpitation, give Aconite, ~Belladaonna, Spigelia, Pulsarilla, Arsenicum or \"Rheu-matismn of the Heart\" will indicate. ADMINISTRATION.-Dissolve twelve globules of the selected remedy in half a teacupful of water, and give every two hours a teaspoonful; discontinue after four teaspoonfuls have been given, for eight or twelve hours, during which time the effect must be looked for before another remedy is selected. As soon as tihe patient is better, all medicine must be stopped, until hle gets much worse again. Aplication of Water. \u2014In this disease the external and internal use of water is of great service to accelerate the cure, not impeding in the least the specific action of the rightly chosen homnopathic remedy. If the parts affected are very painful, cold bandages may be applied, well wrung out and changed frequently; during this time the patient keeps in bed, well covered, drinking water which is not very cold. If perspiration ensues, the patient. may be kept in it from one to two hours, after whicl he is well- iwashed off with a wet towel and irubbed dry; he must then, however, take a sittingbath in milkwarm water, in which he remains until he is perfectly cooled off. These simple appliances, repeated as often as circumstances may require, are powerful accessories to lie 5 [Page 50](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/52) 50 (GENERAL DISEASES. success of specific remedies. If the patient suffers from constipation, give him cold water injections and let him drink cold water freely. It may be well here to give a case treated by us in the above manner, to show the superior efficacy of a united Homeopathic and Hydropathic treatment in this disease. The patient, a strong, robust man, of about forty years of age, had been attacked with inflammatory rheumatism, and treated allopathically for three weeks without any benefit. When we first saw him, the patient suffered from severe pains in almost all of his joints, which were swollen, red, and stiff. He had no rest by night or day, continual fever, coated tongue, diarrhea, and profuse night-sweats. His decline in every respect was evident, and he himself well aware of this circum. stance. His symptoms indicated the use of pdulsajilla, which he received; at the same time the cold water compress was applied to the painful and swollen joints. The pains in the latter ceased almost at once, and the first comfortable night since the disease had commenced was the happy consequence. In the course of the treatment this procedure was repeated as often as other joints would swell and become painful. After pulsatilla, he received china, arnica, bryonia, and rhus, as the symptoms would indicate; finally petroleum to relieve the stiffness of the joints, which was the last remaining symptom. During all this time, the external use of the cold bandages was persevered in, when found necessary, and every time with the greatest relief to the patient. The cure of this bad and unpromising case was completed in little more than a fortnight. Here was evidently a decided favorable result gained by comparatively small means. The whole hydropathic apparatus for such cases was not required, because the specific means used were sufficient to supplant its use. No wet sheet, no general bath, or douche, was applied, in short, nothing which could have interfered with the comfort of the patient; to cause a general favorable reaction of the system specific medication [Page 51](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/53) CHRONIC RHIEUMATISM. 51 was found sufficient, but in assisting it for this purpose, the application of the wet compress on the parts affected fulfilled our most sanguine expectations. DIET AND REGIMEN. \u2014AS regards nourishment, the patient must absolutely abstain from all meat, or soups of meat even long after the convalescence. He can have, however, gruels of farinaceous substances, oatmeal, farina, rice, etc., toastwater and cold water; during the fever, warm or cold lemonade and oranges. Cover the patient well with blankets, as many as his comfort dictates. Around the swollen joints and other parts affected, breast or neck, put wool, just from the sheep, or, at least, unwashed; this is necessary, however, only in case the patient cannot bear the hydropathic applications. This has, frequently, a very good effect. If possible, consult a honceopathic physician. b. CHRONIC RHEUMATISM, or commonly called RHEUMATISM. If a person is severely troubled by chronic rheumatism, let him at once apply to a homceopathic physician, who will give him relief, if it is at all in the power of medicine to do so. But, frequently, the reactive force of nature is already so much weakened, that it first requires to be strengthened, which can only be done by a systematic hydropathic treatment. However, in case of rheumatism, where the system is yet strong, the medicines, as detailed below, may be used, and will be found efficacious in a majority of them. Beside the remedies recorded under \"Acute Rheumatism,\" which may also be used for chronic rheumatism, the following are the gnatia: Contuzsive pains, or as if the flesh were detached from the bones; worse at night, ameliorated by change of posture. Thuja: Tearing, pulsative pains, as from ulceration under the skin, with a feeling of coldness and torpor of the parts [Page 52](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/54) 52 CGENERAIL w-ol~re durilm repose, or i i warmth of the bed. Pain in thle riglt sllolder and arm, letter on mzovement. Arni(ca: Pains as if lhe parts xwvere strained or bruised, with a feeling as if they weere restiryg on too ha'rd a suziface; a tingling in the hand, red and slaininry swelling, worse when attempting to move. (Suitable before or after China, Arsenic, Rhus. ) Dulcamcra: Pains after getting cold and wet, worse at night, during repose, and without much fever. ChinaZ. Pains, worse on the slightest touch, with easy persipiration, the sore parts feel very weak, almost paralyzed. Veratrum z: Pains as if from a bruise; worse by warmth and bad weather; better by walking; very weak and trembling. AArsenic: Burning, tearing pains, insupportable at night, wolse by cold air, and mitigated by external heat. Paosphvorus: Tearing and drawing pains, excited by the slightest chill; headache, vertigo, and oppression of the chest. Caustic: The pains are ins2upportable in the open air; less severe in a room, or in bed; also, when there is paralytic weakness -writh rigyidity and incuzrvation of the pa'rts affected. Szziphur: In almost all cases of chronic, and after a spell of inflammin-atory rheumatism, when the pains yet linger about. Often after Aconite, Belladtonna,.Bryonia, Jfercury, or Pulsatilla. Sepia: For rheumatic affections in tall, slender persons, especially females. APPLICATION OF WATER.-The use of the wet bandage is in many cases of this disease most grateful and advantageous; it relieves pain and subdues inflammation, dissolves obstructions and accelerates the circulation in the parts affected. The application of the douche, or of ice and snow, is rather dangerous and must not be undertaken without the advice of a p:lysician, who is conversant in Hydropathy; the same may be said of the use of the partial baths, applied to the affected [Page 53](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/55) RTIEUM iTIC PAINS OR COLD - GOUT. 03 pa rts, a' S tile reacti'on, followting their use, might increase dry excite perspiration, with thie fo!llowin, washing or ablution, is good in some cases, particularzly where the pains are wandering, but must in a great many cases be dispensed with, as its friequent repetition would exhaust the system too much. The free use of cold water, internally, is strongly recommended. ADMINISTRATION. \u2014 In chronic rheumatism, the remedies ought not to be repeated often; evelry three or four days, one dose (four to six glob.) is enough. After a remedy has been tried for ten or fourteen days, another may be chosen, if no improvement has appeared. DIET AND REGIMEN.-The patient must abstain, during the treatment, from all meats, at least, as much as possible; must not expose himself to the changes of the weather, and should wear, on his skin, flannel underclothes, except while using hydropathy; in which case, he can do without them. RHEUMATIC PAINS OR COLD. ( In Chest, Stomach, Limbs, etc. ) These pains appear in different parts of the body, after taking cold, in persons naturally inclined to rheumatic affections. If they manifest themselves in the cliest, they resemble a pleurisy, for which the same remedies will be suitable; if they appear in the stomach and bowels, they resemble a colic); to which article we refer the reader for the suitable remedies; if the pains are in the head, ears, or teeth, see these headings. In eivery case of this kind, the patient mast be kept warm, and slhould perspire. GOUT. (Arthritis.) DIAGNosIs.-The symptoms of this disease are very similar to those of inflammatory rheumatism: consequently, the reme. dies will be alnost the same. It is characterized by pains in [Page 54](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/56) X5 - GENERAL DISEASES. the joints, with inflammatory swelling, and a feeling of dislocation; or, in chronic cases, with a swelling of the joints, caused by deposits in them of a calcareous substance, wh;ch impedes their movements and causes them to make a cracking noise. There is always connected with an attack of gout, flatulency, acid stomach, and other derangements of the digestive organs. The principal differences between rheumatism and gout are: rheumatism attacks more the muscles and membranes -gout, more the joints; rheumatism is hardly ever complicated with derangement of the digestive organs; gout is never without that-has, beside, permanent swelling of the joints, by calcareous deposit, which rheumatism never has. Rheumatism is caused by taking cold; consequently, depends on external causes; while gout is generated by internal causes, amounting, sometimes, to hereditary predisposition. Both diseases, however, can intermix with each other, one taking the form of the other. We acknowledge an acute and chronic form of gout; recommending for both the same remedies, which we recorded under the two forms of rheumatism. We would add only one more remedy to this list; it is Antimon. crud., when the attack is attended with nausea and a white-coated tongue; pains are worse after eating, in the night, after drinking wine, and in the heat of the sun; mitigated during repose, and in the cool air. To make the selection of remedies easier, we will give a tabular view of them, in the different gouty complaints. Their details will be found under \" Rheumatism.\" For inflammatory SMALL OF TiHE BACK, ETC. 55 For the crudl., Sulphur, (colcarea, duicaclara, R2hus, Sarsaparilla. toe ( Podacyra): Pulsatilla, Arnica. For the stinizess of the limbs, which remains after an attack of gout or rheimnatism, give Colocynth. ADMl1IiSTRATION, DIET, AND REGIMEN, the same as in \"Rheumatism.\" PAINS IN THE SMALL OF THE BACK, LOINS, AND NrECK. iVotalgia. Lumbago. DIAGcNosIs.-Violent pain in the region of the small of the back and loins, more or less permanent, sometimes periodical, but mostly excited by seemingly external causes. This species of lumbago (back and loin-ache) occurs, frequently, after any quick motion of the back, as in rising from a stooping position. The patient is suddenly seized with a violent pain as if produced from an arrow shot into the part; it pins him, as it were, into a fixed attitude, from which he cannot stir without suffering torture, and forces him to keep quiet. If such a rheumatic pain sudldenly affects the muscles of the neck, forcing the patient to keep very quiet, commonly called, Kinki/ or0 C'rick in the neck, it has the same origin, and requires the same treatment, as lumbaco. Rubbing the neck with a soft Warl hand untiringly for half an hour, frequently cures it effectually. Althoughl this disease is essentially rheumatic in its character and process, yet its foundation is constitutional; sometimes I. __~____.. _ ______________..____ ____ [Page 56](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/58) is acquired by overst,-'aining lhe mIirscular system by hard labor during' exposure to wuet, and cold, or whelln thee is a disposition to hcmorrhoidail congestion of blood (.piles) to tliese parts, which may sometimes increase to a real infltalmmction of tile spwine, thle Spinlew ma)rrow (m21yelitis), or go over, if not cured, into a chronic spinal affection.

Constipation is relieved by cold injections and drinking freelyv of cold water. ADMINIsTRRATION.-Same as in Rheliheurlatism.\" DIET AND REGIMEN.-Also tlhe same. We would advise those afflicted with this disease, to lie down immediately on a mattress, or something similar, and not attempt to brave it out, as the phrase is; because the medicine will not be able tc cure as quickly, and chronic weakness of the back remains, together -with a liability to a return of the disease. IPAIN IN THE HIIP. HtI DISEASE. i'Sciat'ca. Coxal yia. Coxrar., DIAGNosls.-Pain in the region of tbhe hip joint, extending to the knee, even to the foot, accurately following the course of the sciatic ner've. lts continual se'verity may impede the motion of the foot, producing stiflness and contraction, disturbing the rest at nioght, and thereby inducing general uneasiness and em'aciation.

TREATMENT. \u2014rThe principal remedies in these diseases are those already enumerated under the ]headings of \"Rheumatism\" and \"GouLt.\" We will gi ive them here again, to facilitate the selection: In DETAIL.-Aconite, in alternation with Belladonna or Bryonia, where the attack is accompanied with a great deal of fever. Belladonna, in the inflammatory stage ( see Aconite ), when the pain is increased on the slightest movement, with limping, and on the parts affected the skin is red and shining; dryness of the throat; burning fever. After it, Mlfercury. -Bryonia, under similar symptoms as Belladonna, but particularly wh.ere the parts affected are more painful than red; constipation. After it, Rhus. 2hus: Darting, tearing, or dragging pains in the hipjoint, with tension and stiffness in the muscles; worse during repose, or when rising from a sitting posturle. Chamomoile: Pains worse at night in bed, after having' recently taken cold; patient is irritable; does not know what ne wants. Mercury: Sharp, cutting, burning pains; worse at night, or during movement; profuse perspiration witiout relief. After Belladonna; before Hepar. pains, ameliorated by change of position.

Pulsatilla: Pains worse in the evening or night, and when seated; relieved in the open air; temperament phlegmatic; mild disposition. iu-x vomica: Pains worse in the morning; worse in the open air; temperament irritable, morose; constipation. Arsenic: Burning pains, with great restlessness, obliging the patient to move the limb; pains appear periodically, or in spells (alternate with China); mitigated by external heat; patient wants to lie down, feels very weak; emaciation of the limb after long suffering (in alternation with Silicea). Colocynth. This is the first and principal medicine in hip diseases, acute or chronic, particularly when there is the sensation of a tight band around the hips and back, and the pains run down from the region of the kidneys into the leg; spontaneous limping; pains are worse lying on the back, or after a fit of anger or indignation. Hepar after Mercury, when this has not relieved. Silicea, when the disease assumes the chronic form, after H:epar; or, where emaciation has taken place, in alternation with Arsenic, and, afterward, with Iodine. Sulphur, in chronic cases, where other remedies have not entirely relieved. Lachesis: Emaciation, with tearing and contracting pain in the joint; dread of exercise; deeply penetrating suppurations (in alternation with Silicea). APPLICATION OF WATER.-See \"Pains in the Small of the Back.\" ADMINISTRATION.-In the sciatica (ischias), as well as the febrile stage of the coxagra, give the medicines as required in the acute form of \" Rheumatism \" (see this article). In the chronic form (suppurative stage) of co. agra, give the remedies as stated in \"Chronic Rheumatism.\" DIET AND REGIMEN. The same as in \"Rheumatism,\" but [Page 60](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/62) 60 GENERAL DISEASES. without outward applications, save cold-water bandages, in any stage of the disease, when the patient call bear them, and feels relieved after them. INFLAMMAATIOIN OF THE KNEE JOINT. (G'oniliS.) Inflammation and swelling of this important joint, requires the use of Aconite and -Belladonna, Bryonzia, JRfus, Lactcesis, il~fercury, one after the other, if the first two have not allayed the inflammation. If suppuration threatens, which is indicated by the swelling not going down after the severest fever is over, give Sulphur; in eight days Silicea, and consult medical aid. ADMINIST-A TION of Aconite, Bellaclonna, and the other remedies, the same as in \"Acute Rheumatism.\" DIET AND REGIMEN.-Also the same, but without any outward application, save cold water bandages, when the patient feels relieved by them, at any stage of the disease. INFLAMMATION OF TIlE PSOAS MUSCLE. (PSOitis.) DIAGNOsIS.-Pain in the region of the klidneys, hip, and downward to the leg, which cannot be stretched, or drawn near to the abdomen, without pain; increased, also, by turninCg, when lying and liftincg, vwith a feeling of numbness of the affected side; walling is possible only by hobbling, witll the body bent forward. Although not often fatal, yet it is very important in its consequences, as its issues may give rise to lingering' diseases. If suppuration tackes place, by not preventingl it in time, the matter discharoges itself in the abdomen, and causes deatll; or it sinks downi fa-rthler and farther, until it reaches, sometimes, even the knee, before it escapes; fiequently, the spine becomes affected and is rendered carious in such cases. The causes of this disease are, beside external injuries, rheumatism, and piles. TREATMENT.-Give, first, Aco.nite, and )Bryonia, in alternlation, every two, thllree, four hours, a. dose (four glob.); [Page 61](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/63) CRAMP IN THE LEGS. 61 afterward, Belladonna or iax vormica, if not relieved within twenty-four hours, and when the pains increase during motion; RAhus and Pulsatilla, however, when the pains are worse during rest; Mfercury and Chamomile, when the pains are worse at nihlt. StaphIysag., when the pains are beating, indicating incipient suppuration. Colocynth, when the disease assumes the chronic form. If possible, consult a physician in this important disease. APPLICATION OF WATER, in this disease, is confined to the use of the wet bandage, often renewed, on the parts affected; lukewarm sitting-baths, afterward applied, will accelerate the cure. ADMINISTRATION, DIET, AND REGIMEN, as in \"Affection of the Knee Joint.\" CRAMP IN THE LEGS. Some persons are habitually afflicted with cramp in the legs, from various causes. The first remedy, which every one naturally will resort to, is, to rub the parts taken with the cramp, either with the hands or a rough towel, which, in a short time, will destroy the spasm. Another expedient is, to jump on the cold floor of the room, if the cramp occurs in the calves of the legs, and while in bed; but, if it should occur frequently in the night, take Veratruzn, every night a dose (four glob.), for a few nights; or, if it occurs in pregnant females, Secale, inthe same manner. If the cramps occur more in the day-time, take Bhus, in the morning, in the same manner. Colocynth relieves the remaining stiffness, also cramps, occurring in the night. Su-lphur, Lycopodium, and Sepia, may be taken in intervals of four or six days, to prevent the return of the cramps. DIET AND RECGIMEN, as in all chronic diseases. [Page 62](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/64) 6 2 GENERAL DISEASES. S-WEATING FEET. This is a complaint with which a great many persons are afflicted. It is generally connected with a qualitative corruption of the secretions, by which a bad smell is emitted, thereby rendering the complaint very disagreeable. It can be easily suppressed by alum and sugar-of-lead ablutions; but he who ventures to do so, risks being taken with blindness, deafness, asthma, consumption, etc. Honmceopathy possesses remedies, which, when applied rightly, will insure a permanent and safe cure. TREATMENT.- RAUS, inwardly, every third evening, six glob., to be continued for at least four weeks, after which two weeks must elapse before the next remedy may be taken. During the first four weeks, bathe the feet every other evening, in cold water, into which four drops of the mother tincture of Rhus (to be had in any homceopathic pharmacy) have been dropped. Silicea, is the next remedy after.Rhus, if this has not already ameliorated the complaint; to be taken in the same manner. In this way, alternate with these two remedies, until better, or apply to a homceopathic physician, who has more remedies at his command, which, however, can be chosen, only according to the individual constitutionality of each one's case. APPLICATION OF WATER.-Cold foot-bath must not be used in this disease; if a person wants to use the hydropathic means, he had better resort to an institution, as in this disease, simple as it seems to be, the greatest caution is necessary in the use of water, and generally a full treatment, to change the constitution of the patient. GOITRE. (Struma. ) This disease consists in a swelling of the thyroid gland, in front of the throat. It is, in the majority of cases, of a scrofulous origin; (depends, sometimes, however, on an endemical [Page 63](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/65) SLEEPLESSNESS. 63 cause, it occurring most frequently on mountains, especially at their base, and in their valleys. TREATMENT. \u2014Take, internally, Spongia, every evening a dose (six glob.) and wash externally with a solution of the tincture of Iodine diluted in alcohol, every evening, until it disappears. If this treatment does not disperse the goitre within two months, apply to a homceopathic physician, who has other remedies, suitable for each individual case. DIET, as usual in chronic diseases. SLEEPLESSNESS. (Agrypnia.) This disease consists in an impossibility to sleep, without any apparent external or internal cause to disturb the sleep. If it continues for months and years, a serious disturbance of all functions must ensue. In infants, particularly, it becomes a distressing circumstance for mothers and nurses, as we often are unable to find out its cause. TREATMENT.- Cofka and Belladonna, two doses in alternation (in children, TCofteac and Bellad.\"C'O), every hour one dose (four glob.) frequently allay the over-exciteiment of the nervous system. If this will not do one night, try, on the next, Belladonna, if caused by congestion of blood to the head. Hyoscyamus, especially after severe illness. Ignatia, when caused by grief, indignation. Vwx vomica, when from study and meditation in hypochondriacs. Opium, after fright and fear, or in old people, or where frightful visions appear when closing the eyes. Pulsatilla, when having indulged too freely in eating. Aconite, when caased by agitating events and anxiety. If caused by drinking tea or coffee, see their antidotes in the articles respecting these substances. In children, beside C(ofea and Bellad., are recommended [Page 64](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/66) GENIERAL DISEASES. C/hant., Juale2, and Rheum., when it is caused by colic. See this article in \"Diseases of Children.\" APPLICATION OF WATER. \u2014Beside these remedies, a spongebath of cold water, every evening when going to bed, is stronly recoamlended; also a cold foot-bath, before going to bed, if the patient cannot sleep on account of congestion to the head. NIGHTMARE. ( Incuus. ) A well known troublesome disease, consisting in a heavy pressure on the precordial region, which impedes breathing,.creating thereby many images of fancy, monsters, robbers, bears, etc. It occurs mostly in the first hours of sleep, and, if recurring every night, would certainly injure the general state of health. It is caused either by an overloaded stomach, congestion of the blood to the abdomen, or to the precordial region, when lying on the back. TREATAIENT. \u2014 -Persons liable to this disease must first avoid the above-mentioned exciting causes, before the following remedies can have their effect: Aconite: Especially in women and children, when feverishness, oppression of the chest, anxiety, and inquietude, prevail. 4 Lzcux vomica, after drinking spiritous liquors, eating a full meal in the night, or by sedentary habits. 2Oium: The principal remedy in severe attacks, snoring, respiration, eyes half open, face covered with cold perspiraLion, and convulsive movements of the limbs. APPLICATION OF WATER. \u2014The wet bandage around the chest during the night is strongly recommended, with a cold ablution and dry rubbing in the morning; beside daily exercise in the open air, and the free use of cold water internally. DIET must, be moderate, consisting more of vegetables than meat; constipation is relieved by cold water injections, and the drinking of cold water. [Page 65](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/67) PALSY -- PARALYSIS. 5 PALSY. (Parl-dy.si,'s.) Tlh;is ait'ction of the nerves of voluntary motion, is one of tiose disea.ss, to remove whlich, it requires tilhe greatest skill of a plhysiciani; and, by bringing it under our-notice here, we intend merely to warn our readers not to waste time, health, and rnoney, in usino a variety of nostrums which might be recommended for it; but to apply at once to a skillful homceopathic physician, who can effect a cure in a majority of cases. Ieside, we will record a few remedies, with which such a cure may be commenced. If fron de6ility caused by loss of fluids, China, Ferrum, If from suppression of an eruption or habitual discharge, Laclhesis, SuXlphur, Caustic. If from handling white-lead, or exposure to the fumes of lead, Opium, -Bellad., Platina, Pulsatilla. If tlhe facial Silicea. ]lecdtricity Galvanism may be used in this disease with thie greatest advantage, as also the cold water in bathing and diinkincg. See \"Hydropathy.\" APPLICATION OF'WATER. \u2014 Rubbing with cold water, the wet bandage, and finally the douche are powerful helps in this disease; but their use ought to be sought rather in bydropatlhic institutions, where the facilities for their application are greater and more regulated. 6 [Page 66](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/68) 66 GENERAL DISEASES. DELIRIUM TREMENS. (Af/ania Za ipotu.) This terrible disease is almost exclusively confined to drunkards and opium eaters, who are taken especially when exhausted otherwise, with a delirium and frenzy, in which appearances of horrible monsters, animals, figures of all kinds, frighten their imagination, combined with ravings, convulsion fits, and complete inability to sleep. In the long and sleepless hours, they converse incessantly with these supposed realities, by which they wear out their strength more and more. TREATMENT.- Opium is the specific in this disease, if it is caused by ardent spirits, as this drug is itself able to produce such a disease. Give of it, every hour or two hours, a dose (one or two drops of a diluted tincture of opium), for at least twenty hours, to see its effects. After this, give Bellad., XNtx. 14yosc, Sulphur, one after the other, each, for twenty-four hours, every three or four hours a dose (six glob.), or Calcarea carbonica, if frightful images appear as soon as the patient shuts the eyes, or when he talks in his sleep, groans, cries, dreams fantastically and frightfully. If nothing will produce sleep, give Lachesis and Arsenic, in alternation, every three hours a dose (four glob.). Let the patient drink freely of cold water, as the best stimulus which can be substituted. For solid nourishment, give him hard-toasted bread: as soon as he is convalescent, give him a good beefsteak, bread, and water, on which he has to subsist for a long time. In this way, I have cured very bad cases, and had the satisfaction to see them not only restored to health again, but to usefulness and their friends, as they never relapsed into their former error. EPILEPSY. (Epilepsia. ) DIAGNOSIS. -Convulsive motions, with loss of consciousness; falling down, with cries, foaming at the mouth, the thumbs fixed into the palms of the hands. The loss of con [Page 67](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/69) ST. VITUS' S DANCE. 67 sciousness is the most essential symptom, not the violen!ce of the convulsions. Hysterical spasms are very similar to the epileptic, but seldom produce an entire loss of consciousness. Most of the epileptic patients can be cured, but it requires the attendance of a skillful homceopathic practitioner. We refrain, therefore, from mentioning here any more of the treatinent of this disease, but that which relates to the attack itself. TREATMENT.-A patient in an epileptic fit must be placed in a position in which he cannot hurt himself; give him, lhowever, full liberty of his own actions, without holding him, or forcing open his thumbs, which is of no use. Let him smell on CcUamor spirits. If convenient, put between his teeth a cork or piece of wood, to prevent his tongue being injured. As soon as possible, give him one dose (four glob.) of Bellad.; or, if his face is dark and congested, his breathing very hard and snoring, a dose of Opium (four glob.). ST. VITUS's DANCE. ( Chorea.) DIAGNOSIS.-Invoiuntary motions of single members or the whole body, wandering from one part to the other. The patient retains full consciousness, which is a distinctive feature of this disease from epilepsy. It varies very much in degree; occurs most frequently at the time of the development of puberty, from the seventh to the sixteenth year, more among the female sex, more in moist regions on the sea-coast than in more elevated places. It may occur, also, as an epidemic, and is then infectious, particularly when large crowds meet. It is not a dangerous disease, but troublesome, and may lead to othler derangements; ought to be attended to, therefore, immediately, as, in such a case, it can easily be cured. TREATMEENT. \u2014As we recommend our readers to apply, in a case o th-is kind, to a homeopathic physician at once, we limit our remarks on the treatment to a few remedies, which may be given in the beginning. [Page it, A 5 2 f (m,!r I't;r a dose, (six glob.) for eight,.'_1' - isc! n:.i;. ~ fltil). ice Uor four weeks, to await )I;E'T AND RxEIMEN.-No greasy substances, no coffee or tea, but good plain food. Try to divert the attention of the patient from his disease; never speak of it in his presence. TETANUS. TRISMus. (Loclcjaw.) DIAGNoosis.-Constant spasmodic contraction of one muscle, or all the muscles. According to the parts affected and the direction in whichll the body is drawn, the disease has received different nales; which distinction does not come, however, within the limitLs of our description, as such severe diseases as these will require medical aid. We intend helre to speak more especially of one form of tetanus, called trismus or loclcjaw, which is of frequent occurrence in southern latitudes, and, fi'om its quick termination, requires prompt action, and, therefore, domestic attention. LoCKJAW. (Trismus.) Ith arises immediately after a wound has been inflicted, in consequence of the violent pain and nervous irritation, in which case it proves fatal in a very short time; or it occurs in the first few days after the infliction of a wound, during its inflannmmatory stage, or from eigh;t to ten days afterward, while the wound is healing and suppurating, without any pain and inflammation. The exciting causes are, mental affections, taking, cold, corrupt air, foreign bodies in the wound, tension, and distraction of single fibers in the wound. The most dangerous are the stitch wounds in tendonous parts, as in the sole of the foot and the palm of the hand. The pulse frequently remains normal, the head free, yet there is great anxiety and oppressed breathing. [Page 69](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/71) liOCKJAW. 69 T.Tfl::T 1ENT.-Enlarrg e the wound, if possible, and poultice it, wi;il1 lead and mailk. Beside, give the following remeA,-nicc. In tlhe becginning, externally, in a wash or fomentation; internally, in globules or drops, every two hours a dose (four' glob. or one drop). aBellcUion?.zc and Lac/iesis, in alternation, in the same dose and time, if the spasms increase. If no improvement, after twelve hlours, takes place, give 0p2ium and IIyoscyamus, in the $arne mannellr. Secile, if the patient feels worse in the warmth. IfOnCiab, if the patient grows worse, whenever touched or hiandled. Rhus and fyltica, in case the body is bent backward, in ~.lae forim tf' a1n arch. AdmLinister it in thlle same manner. ra movicz.nz ill the same form of lockjaw, if the two former reimedies weire of no avail. APCJPL[ATTION OF WATER.-The action of tile homceopathic remedies, in this disease, must be supported by the following hvydropatti:hic process. The patient having been put in a bathing-tub, is rub bed well and for a long time witll cold water, after wh-ich he is brought to bed again andl rubbed dry with tIe!,ands oir dry woolen cloths. In an hour or two this process }has to be repeated, if no change has taken place; sometimes it is good to expose the spine to the douche, after which the rubbing with thle hands must be repeatedl again. We here insert a case of lockjaw successfully treated by Isaac Colby, MI. D., of Salem Mass., and reported in the Proccedlings of the American Institute of Homeopathy, in the year 1853. Jan. 1853. William Horton, aged twenty-two, received an injury by a nail projecting from a timber, by which a deep and lacerated wound was made between the metacarpal bones of the third and -fourth fingers of the left hand, nearly through the hand. A few drops of dark-colored blood flowed out, and the [Page 70](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/72) 70 GENERAL DISEASES. pain for a few minutes was intense. When it abated he was faint and dizzy, but recovered so as to eat his dinner. After dinner a blindness came over him, he felt sick, and vomited, and lost the power of locomotion \u2014seemed to be paralyzed. Spasms then commenced in the pit of thle stomach, and soon spread all over him, at first remittent, returning once in two or three minutes, and attended with vomiting. The injury oceurred at 12 NI. I saw him four or five hours after, in company with my partner, Dr. J. G. Wood. At 6 o'clock, the extensor muscles of the whole body became rigidly contracted, so that he formed a semicircle, and when on his back rested only on the heels and head, and his sufferings appeared exceedingly great. At this stage, seeing that the disease was progessing with such fearful rapidity, I thought it not proper to spend much time in administering ordinary remedies, especially as I had one at hand of such undoubted efficiency, as I knew cold water to be. I had him immediately placed in a position to receive as much of the water in tubs as could conveniently be done, but, considering the urgency of the case, was not very particular about that. I commenced pouring all over him water of a temperature near that of freezing point, from a pitcher, at the rate of a bucket full every five minutes, and continued it half an hour. Then I wiped him with a towel, wrapped him in blankets, put him in bed with a great amount of covering, and let him remain there two or three hours, till reaction and free perspiration took place. Then he was sponged all over in cold water. When I had poured the water on him about twenty minutes, and he had begun to be very cold, he felt the spasms evidently give way, first in the least affected side, and then, in a few minutes, in the half of the body that had received the injury, and the pain abated, and the limbs became flexible. But, to make the cure certain, I continued the pouring a short time after he was relieved, till he shook violently all over with the cold. [Page 71](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/73) LOCKJAW. 71 After the reaction had taken place, and he had been sponged with cold water, to carry off the superfluous heat, a soreness of all the muscles remained, with violent headache, and he could not endure any motion or noise for several days, and could not be raised from his bed for more than a week, but, by the application of appropriate remedies under the care of Dr. Wood, he gradually recovered without any symptoms of a return of the spasms. The application of cold water in this manner, is not technically Hydropathy. It is simply a sudden reduction of temperature by means of an agency acting on the Homceopathic law of cure, with an energy and power to which no other known remedy can approach. And it meets a more extensive range of diseases than any other remedy, because it has the leading foundation symptoms of diseased action-which is a sensation of cold. When the vital organism is assailed by any hurtful cause, the first manifestation is a sense of coldness or shivering, more or less perceptible. This is so uniform, it may be considered the first symptom of an abnormal state. And when the vital power is not too much overcome, the cold is followed by heat, *and this generally by perspiration. This constitutes the essential type of disease, and shows the natural movement of the animal economy when assailed by any hurtful agency. and points out the true mode of cure. The cold stage is the leading symptom consequent on the exciting cause, and the heat and perspiration may be but a salutary action to throw off the attack. Often it is successful, and one paroxysm terminates the disease. The reason why every attack is not thus speedily terminated, is because the power of reaction is not always sufficient of itself to throw it off. Here we need an agent that will powerfully impress the whole organism, and put it in a pathological condition analogous to that which constitutes the main features of the disease, and in a manner that will secure a certain and energetic reaction. The reduction of [Page 72](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/74) 72 GENERAL DISEASES. temperature, by the application of cold water, is precisely this agency. I have made a great many experiments, by this reduction of temlnperature, during the last four years. I place the patient in a large tub, either seated, with feet in another tub, or standing on a stool to keep the feet out of water, without coverling, or with a sheet about the shoulders, as circumstances require, and pour the water from a pitcher upon the head and shoulders, letting it run down the body at the rate of a bucketful every five minutes, till the patient shakes violently with cold, which takes from twenty minutes to three quarters of an hour, according to the temperature of the water. Then wipe and wrap in a blanket, and cover in bed till reaction and free perspiration takes place, which requires from two to four hours. Then sponge in cold water to carry off the superfluous heat, and put on ordinary covering. In this way I have treated more than a hundred cases during the last four years. I now know what results I can depend on with great certainty. This remedy is far more effectual in the early stage, while it remains but a functional disease. It is the true Homoeopa.thic remedy for all spasms. Intense cold always causes rigidity of the muscles. In tetanus it call never fail to cure. In this case I had no doubt of its success, and had decided to continue to pour the water till the spasms gave way. A person may remain very cold for a long time, without any danger to life, if rightly treated. I would rather keep a patient pulseless and senseless three weeks, by the application of cold, than have them die with this disease. I have in several cases of other diseases, continued to pour cold water till after the pulse ceased in the wrist, and till the patient was so stiff he could not rise from the seat. In this case, if the spasms had returned, I should have applied it again more thoroughly than before. Again, there is trembling where a person has become very cold. It is therefore the remedy for clonic spasms. Can a person trelm [Page 73](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/75) SOMNOLENCY. LETIHARGY. 73 ble with any other spasms, when he is shaking tremendously with cold? I have applied it in many cases of spasms in children, some of which are reported in the second volume of the Quarterly Journal of Homoeopathy. It never fails to stop them. But when they depend on organic lesions, when the patient gets warm, they may return again. It is adapted to all acute diseases, when applied in the early stage. I believe there is a period in every fever when one application of cold water, as described above, would effectually stop its progress, and the patient would be immediately as well as before the attack. I have had much experience on this point. But too often this period has passed by before the physician is called. In the Asiatic cholera I think it can not fail of adaptation. It is the means of conducting the patient through the same pathological stages which constitute the essential characteristics of the disease, with a certainty of a successful, healthy reaction, I should expect it would cure every case if seasonably applied. This remedy is capable of doing, in many cases, what all other remedies would fail to accomplish, and is safe in its application, but is too formidable for extensive use. DIET AND IREGIMEN.-The same as in fevers. Again we would advise not to be negligent in the treatment of even apparently slight injuries; if pain and tension is felt in the wound, it should be treated at once and faithfully with poultices, until the pain has ceased and the wound begins to discharge the healthy matter. SOMINOLENCY. LETHARGY. DIAGNosIs. \u2014A sleep, continued beyond the natural time, for days or weeks. During this time, short intervals of waking intervene, but the patient soon relapses into sleep again. Nourishment can be given only by injecting fluid aliments; otherwise, the functions of life are not disturbed. In such eases, a physician will be consulted; but up to 7 [Page 74](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/76) 74 GENE'RAL DI:SEASES. the time of his corninA, thle following medicines may be given. Opium, if the pulse is full and slow, the breatlling snoring, and the face very red, even dark; every three hours a dose, or until better. Belladonna, if the head is hot and the feet are cold; pulse accelerated and hard. Lachesis, if the pulse is very weak; beside, Acoznite, Feratrum, Pulsalilla, Phosphoric acid, on.e after the other, if necessary. APPLICATION OF WATER.-Tllat cold water must be a powerful auxiliary in the treatment of this disease, is very evident; its use must be regulated according to the symptoms of the case; cold foot-bath, if the hlead is hot and congested; sitz-baths, hand and head-baths are variously applicable. FATIGUE, OVERHEATING, AND MENTAL EXIIAUSTION. Arnica, for a feeling as if the body were lbruised, after overexertion of tlhe body, and too long and ftast traveling on foot; wash the fatigued limbs in water, with whllich a few drops of the Arnica tincture has been mixed. _Rhus: Pains in the joints. After Arvnica, if this was not sufficient. In alternation with Bryonia, if there are shooting pains in the small of the back on moviny. China: Weakness after loss of fluids, or leavy perspirations. Veratrunm, if persons are so fatigued as to cause fainting, in alternation with Ipecac. or Apis ecil. Cffea and Cami2hor, in alternation, when thle system is exhausted by disease, abstinence from food, or violent exercise. Gocculus and TNix vom., if caused by ]ong nighllt-watching. Aconite, if, with weakness, there is palpitation of the lheart, pain in the side, difficulty of breathing, aching in the limbs from running fast; and tlen in alternation wvith.Bryonia. exertion causes fatigue, followed by F[ertrhza, and Calcarea, if necessary. ADMINIrSTRATION. - Dissolve twelve glob. of a remedy in h lalf a teacupful of water, and give, every half-hour or hour, a teaspoonful, until better. If ove7wated by bodily exercise in the summer, take a little brandy and water, and no cold drinlks until restored again; or, if possible, take a warm bath for twenty minutes. If the limbs feel sore, rub with Arnica, or alcohol in which soap is dissolved. For mental etlrhaustion by over-study or anxious Ji.ghltwatching, take N;cux vomica; if very much. excited and sleepless, C'ofta; if with fullness of the head, Belladonna. FAINTING, SWOONING. (Syncop)e.) Nervous persons, particularly females, are subject to fainting fits, excited by various causes, external or internal. The first thing to be done is, to lay the patient quietly on a bed or couch, where the fiesh air is accessible; loosen everything tight about t]he neck, chest, and stomach, and sprinkle cold water in thle face, for a minute or two; duringo this time sonicme one has procured spirits of camplhor, which now may be held under the nose, to be inhaled. This, in most cases, is sufficient to restore the patient for the time, wlio must now be let alone, to gather strengtlh. If the cause of the fainting can be ascertained, one of thle followiCng remedies may be given, to destroy the bad consequences whlich the attack may lihave on tlhe nervous byfi By depletion, blood-letti./q, etc., China, CCarbo vey., /eracrunm, when, also, a little wine or brandy and water may be given. ADMiINISTRATION.-Dissolve twelve glob. of the selected medicine in half a1 teacupful of water, and give, every five or ten minutes, a teaspoonful. If not relieved in twenty or thirty minutes, prepare and give another remedy in the same manner. APPARENT DEATH. WSenever a sudden extinction of life appears, our suspicion must be aroused, as regards the real or apparent death of the individual, in as far as we frequently might be able to restore the apparently dead to life again, if we would only take the trouble and have the patience to use the requisite means. And even when these are applied, it is often done in an unsystematic manner. As most cases of apparent death occur under violent circumstances, such as drowning, hanging, etc., it is quite natural that the minds of the by-stauders become agitated and confused, not knowing what is first to be done. This uncers tainty and hurry of action, however, cannot produce any favorable results in resuscitating the apparently dead. It is of the utmost importance to remain self-possessed, to reflect well, and then to do only one thing at a time, until all available means to restore life are exhausted. There are a great many accidents in life, by which its existence is put in jeopardy. We will enumerate them here, and the means which ought to be used. On poisoning, we give a separate chapter.

If starvation was the cause of an apparent suspension of (ife, inject small quantities of warm milk mixed with a very little brandy or Madeira wine; beside, lay cloths, dipped in warlm milk and brandy, on the stomach. Do not attempt to ripve any nourishment by the mouth, until after the patient [Page 77](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/79) APPARENT DEATH' FROM DROWNING. 77 has commenced breathingl again, at which time the warm milk may be given to him, drop by drop, through the mouth. Increase the (loses of milk very gradually, until the patient can take a teaspoonful; then a few drops of wine or brandy will be salutary. After a while, give him small quantities of beef-tea, or other broth. Solid food is not allowed, until after the patient has had a sound, healthy sleep: and even then, he has to be very careful in not'eating too much at a time, or indulging in anything indigestible. 2. -Apparent Death from Drowning. The following cautions ought to be observed: 1. Be quick, but not rough, in all that has to be done. 2. Do not roll the body on casks. 3. Do not hold it up by the feet. 4. Do not rub the body with salts or spirits, nor inject smoke or infusion of tobacco. 5. Do not bleed the patient. But do the following immediately: 1. Convey the body, carefully, in a raised position, to the nearest house, if possible; or, if not, lay it on a dry, sandy place, in the hot sun. 2. Strip the body, and rub it dry; then wrap it in warm blankets, either in a warm bed, or in heated sand or ashes, until other means of warming the body can be procured, such as bottles of hot water, warming pans, heated bricks, etc., wl-ich may be applied successively on the stomach, spine, thighs, under the armpits, and soles of the feet. 3. Wipe and cleanse the mouth, nostrils, and throat, carefully; during this operation the body may be turned on its side, the head bent forward, to allow the water to run out of the mouth; all the water which can run out is in the mouth. 4. Rub, continually and briskly, the whole body with the hands, or with warm cloths. Do not suspend, however, thle use of the other means.

From tinme to time, try to inflate the lungs of the patient, by introducing' into one of the nostrils the pipe of a pair of bellows, carefully closing the mouth and the other nostril; blow the bellows,gently until the cliest rises, then sec the mouLh and. nostrils fiee, and press lighltly on the chest, to eject the air f'om thle lungs; after which,-the same process must be repeated and continued for some time. 6. Immerse the body, if possible, in a warnm batli, at blood rheat. 7. Electricity or galvanism may be used. 8. Put a few globules of Lachesis, and afterward, Opium on the tongue of thle patient. 9. Continue tllis treatment for, at least, four or six hours even if then no sions of life appear, do not remove, tlhe body immediately from its position, but wait until signs of decomposition are manifest. If, however, the patient recovers and can swallow, give him small quantities of warm wine or brandy and water. Beside, watch him and attend to his further wants carefully. 3.

If possible, cover the body all over (except the face) witll newly-excavated earth. These means are the best, because iwater and wet ground are good conductors of electricity, with which the patient's system is surcharged at the time. Inwardly, give him, fiom time to time, a few globules of NTux vomica, of which, also, a solution may be injected. If the patient recovers, remove him to a liglt, sunny room, where lie slhould be kept quiet for some time, without mental excitemnent.

Thie fracture of a bone is presumed to have'taken place, wxllen the force and (direction o)f thle injury or accidient were sufficient to accomplish it. Its certainty, hlowever, is established, when on closer exaiminat.tion, we find the injured linmb shorter, in somle imeasure defor:)medl, unable to move, when the patient feels stinging pails on tlhe injured place, and wh1en we can 1hear on hiandling' this spot, a crepitation, that is, a grating noise, whiclh is produced when the two broken surfaces of the bone are rubbed together. There iare a nlumber of terlms to indicate the nature and extent of the injury sustained by aa firacture. It is calied a8 sim8Ule fracture, whlen the bone is broken vithlout any stverl'e contusion or external wound. A compoutnd fracture is atlended by an external wound or protrusion ot the broken bone through tile skin. Coimpliccted is a f!racture, wllen tle bone is either broken in more tllha one place or is attended by otler severe injuries, such as lacerations of flesh, ligaments, larger blood-vessels, etc. In a tcansverse fracture the bone is broken in a perpendlicular diecltion to its axis, while in the obligze firacture this is not the case. If the bone is broken into several nieces, thle firactulre is called a comminutecd fracture. Tr.tEATMENT. - Put the patient in a comfortable position; move tlhe broken limb or part as carefully as possible, and comparCe its formation with the corresponding' lelt!ly one.

The use of Synmpk)ytl/lu accelerates the adhesion of the broken parts.''e attention of a suIrgeon must be soulght, at any rate; but, if lie cannot be had. a repetition of the above bandaging on the thlird, sixth, and twelfth day, etc., will be sufficient to insure the healing, of the fractured parts. In fractures of the skull, do nothing more tllan apply cold water and _Arzica, as above stated, until a surgleon arrives. 2. DISLOCATIONS OF JOINTS. Compare the dislocated part *with the corresponding healthy one, and consider, quietly, witllout being confused, whether it can easily be brought back, for which purpose a few trials may be made. If, however, this should be too hazardous, desist fiom any further attempts, but use cold water and Arnica, as stated in \"Fractures of Bones,\" and wait for the arrival of a competent surtgeon. If bandages are necessary, their use must be to confine the joint for some time in the same position after it becomes set. 3. WouNDs AND BRUISES. Wounds are either incisive, lacerated, conlused, punctlured, or quenshlot wounds, according to the various instruments which have inflicted tlhem. Our object is to heal them as quickly as possible, as circumstaiees will allow. This is done, by briinging' tleir edges imnteldiately in close contact and keeping tdihem there by adhesive plaster or sutures, which is the quickest mode of heal [Page 84](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/86) 84 EXTERN-AL INJcURIES. ing wounds, particularly those of the incisive kind. In some wounds the edges cannot be brought together, because the flesh is!atcerated or bruised. Cases of this kind have to heal by means of suppuration, by which healthy granulation is produced, gluing as it were the parts together. This process applies to all the other kinds of wounds, including the lunctzured and ygzunshot wounds. One important consideration must always be kept in view: never to allow the surface of a wound to heal or close before it is certain that its deeper parts have firmly adhered. This can be prevented by introducing lint to the bottom of the wound, renewing it as often as necessary, at least once a day, and cleaning it with lukewarm water. The first thing to be done, in attending to a wound, is to clean it, by cold water, firom all foreign bodies which may be in it. Splinters must be extracted carefully, and the hemorrba'ge stopped, which, in most cases, ceases after the application of cold water nmixed with a few drops of Arnica tincture (see \"IFractures\"); if it does not stop, however, or if the blood gushes out of the wound in jets, and is of a bright red color (arterial blood), try to compress the wound with lint dipped in arnica-water, overlaid with a sponge; and if this does not succeed, compress with the fingers the artery above the wound (on a place nearer to tle hearit), which can be found on the inside of a limb, indicated by the beating of the artery; if this cannot be done, bind around the whole limb, above the wound, a handkerchief, as tight as is necessary to stay the hemorrhage. If the patient has lost a great quantity of blood, giive him some good wine and a few doses of Clizc,; hlie will feel strongel in a shoirt time. When this is done, dress the wounds, eithter withi adhesive plaster (if they,are cut or incisive wounds), or loosely with lint kept constantly wet by cold water mixed with Arnica tincture (see \"Fractures \"). Give, internally, a few drops of Arnica tinc-,ure in water, and place the pa'tieRnt in a comlfortable position, Cont~,sed and- bruised wounds'Illow certain degree of [Page 85](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/87) SPRAINS AND CONCUSSIONS. 85 compression, by adhesive plaster, after the inflammation has left, to mnake the edges adhere more closely; this can be done afterward. Another important consideration is, to keep healing wounds well cleansed, by means of allowing the secreted matter to escape easily in the lint spread over the wound to keep off the air. Every day a suppurating wound ought to be cleansed and bathed freely in lukewarm water. If a wound inflames, becomes hot, swollen, and painful, put a warm bread-and-milk poultice over it, until it feels easier; internally, give Chamomile, Bellaclonna, and Hepaar, alternately, every two hours a dose (four glob.). If a woundfever sets in, give Aconite, Chamomile, and Belladonna, in alternation, in the same manner. If lockjau should appear, see page 68. N. B. Although Arnica tincture is recommended above in all kinds of wounds as the proper outward application, yet Calendula tincture is best after Arnica, in all contused and lacerated wounds. If a wound suppurates too freely, or secretes unhealthy matter, give Hepar and Silicea, in alternation, every evening a dose (four glob.), until better. 4. SPRAINS AND CoNCUSSIONs. These are caused by falls, lifting of heavy weights, jerks, false steps, etc. Bruises, wounds, or fractures, which may attend them, have to be treated first. If the patient is free from them, however, put him at once in a comfortable position, and use, externally, a mixture of cold water and Arnica tincture, particularly when the parts are black and blus (bloodshot); after it, Rhus in solution, when the joints, membranes and tendons, are more affected. This latter remedy is also suitable for the bad consequences of lifting too heavy weights (strains). Internally give Bryonia and R2ihus in alternation, every four [Page 86](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/88) 8 6 EXTERNAL 1NJURIES. hoIurs six glo)ules, until the patient feels relieved firom the sii'tcs, and,soreness in the limibs. Diet, mulst be light, no meat or stimulatintg drinks are allowed; -gruels and lemonades are recommended. 5. BUvnNS AND SCALDS. Sli(ldt t degrees of these injuries heal quickly by holding the scalded parts to the fire (if that is possible), or fomenting them withl warm alcohol, or coveringt them with a plaster of Castile soap. But burns and scalds increase in importance and danger, in proportion to the depthl and extent of the injury, which, if very great, threatens the life of the patient. It' more than one-half of the surface of the skin is deeply scalded, the sufferer will seldom recover. A great many remedies are recommended for burns and scalds, but their usefulness must be determined according to the quickness with which they can be procured, their easy applicability, and, lastly, their specific effect on the burns, as such. TREATMENT. \u2014Tle best remedy in slight cases is already mentioned above. In severer cases, and even the worst, use Catstile soeqp, scraped and mixed with water to a thick lather; spread it on strips of linen or cotton cloth, to the thickness of the sixthl of an inchl; then spread it over the wound, taking care to cover with soap every burned part, and keep it moist for awhile with cold water, whlich may be dropped on top, very sparingly, from time to time. Let these plasters remain until they drop off themselves; or, if matter forms undernealth, remove thllem and dress the wounds with a salve made of equal parts of sweet oil or linseed oil and lime-water, which is a ver'y good remedy in the beginning, if it only could be had (quick enough. Another remedy, easy of access is, raw cotton, with which the burncd parts must be covered, pressing it lightly on the wounds; or wheat flour profusely strewed over them. [Page 87](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/89) BURNS AND SCALDS. 87 If a person hlas inhaled hot steam, or has burned his throat with hot liquids, give him, of a solution of Castile soap in whisiyV or alcohol (which can be made very soon, by scraping soap into the liquor and shaking the bottle well), every five or ten minutes, two or three drops in water, lengthenino the intervals as the patient gets better. N. B. Every steamboat ounght to be provided with a bottle of spirits of soap, decidedly the best remedy for these internal burns, as it acts specifically on the injured nervous system and composes immediately. Another remedy is the tincture of Urtica urens (stiqging nettle), of which each homceopatlhic medicine-chest contains a bottle. Apply it in a manner similar to the Arn~,icac tincture (twelve drops to a pint of water). For internal burns, put three drops of it in a teacupful of water, and give, every five or ten minutes, a teaspoonful, until better. If the burns ulcerate, was]h them withl a solution of twelve globules of Caustic in half a teacupful of water, three times a day, and give internally, Sl7p2hur and Silicea, alternately, every evening a dose (six glob.) until better. DIET AND REGIMEN.-The diet must be light, as in fevers; but when ulceration takes place, give stimulating diet, beef, etc., even brandy and water. If a diarrhea ensues during- the healing of the burns, do not disturb it by giving medicine for it (except it be too excessive), as it is a critical discharge, the intestines supplying by their action, the interrupted functions of the skin. When dressing the wounds, open the blisters which have fotmed, remove as much of the skin as can be done easily, and take care that the patient is not exposed to currents of air during this operation, which must not last. a longer titme, nor be oftener repeatetl, than is necessary; but, if the patient should have taken cold, in consequence of whicll the wounds pain very much and become inflamed, red, swollen (a kind of erysipelas in the scalded varts). give Jellr(doiaa and Rhuls, in alternation, every tw-o hours a dose, dress the already when this tooklr place, give C(amomile, Bellad., and epia:,, in tiie same manner, and dress the wounds with a warm poultice of bread and mllilk, until suppuration commences again and the fever subsides. 6. POISONED WOUNDS. BITES AND STINGS OF INSECTSSBees,,Spiders, Bugs,.Mfusquitoes, Snakes, efad -Doys. In injuries from the above-named animals, except the two last (which are treated of below), cover the injured part with wet or damp earth, immediately, and thenl wet it afterward with a mixture of cold water and Arnica tincture (twenty parts to one). Internally, give Ledum (twelve glob., dissolved in water). every half hour a teaspoonful until better. In the treatment of wounds inflicted by venomous snakes and mad clogs, and of their immediate or distant consequences, hydropihobia, etc., there exists yet a great deal of uncertainty and diversity of opinion. The old school has at least retired, as it seems, from further investigation on the subject (their last trial was that of using Chloroform and Ether); and it befits honceopat'hists the more to promote farther investigations, as they alone possess the true means to shorten the labor in discussing the merits of a proposed remedy. As experiences in this class of diseases occur so rarely, the observations and opinions will be slow in forthcoming. We prefer to give those of Dr. Hering, as follows: The best remedy against the bites of venzomous serpents, mad dogs, etc., is the application of dclry heat AT A DISTANCE. Whatever is at hand at the moment, a red-hot iron or live coal, or even a lighted cigar, must be placed as near the wound as possible, without, however, burning the skin, or causing too sharp pain; but care must be taken to have another instrument ready in the fire, so as never to allow the heat to lose its intensity. It is essential, also, that the heat should not exercise its;nfluence over too lairge a surface, but only on the wound and the [Page 89](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/91) POIpSONED WOUNDS. 8 9 part' aljaenT If oil oir grease can be readily procured, it may be applied round tle wound, and this operation should be repeated as often as the skin becomes dry; soap or even saliva may be employed, where oil or grease cannot be obtained. Whlatever is disclhared in any way friom the wound ought to be care rilly removed. The application of burning heat should be continued in this manner until the patient begins to shiver and to stretch himself; if this takes place at the end of a few minutes, it will be better to keep up the action of the heat upon the wound for an hour, or until the affections produced by the venom are observed to diminish. Internal medicines must be judiciously administered at the same time. In the case of a BITE FROM A SERPENT, it will be advisable to take, from time to time, a gulp of salt and water, or a pinch of kitchen salt, or of gunlowder, or else some pieces of garlic. If, notwithstanding this, bad effects manifest themselves, a spoonful of whisky or brandy, administered every few minutes, will be the most suitable remedy, until intoxication ensues; some of the most desperate cases have been cured in this manner. If the shooting pains are agguravated, and proceed from the wound toward the heart, and if the wound becomes bluish, marbled, or swollen, with vomiting', vertigo, and fainting, the best medicine is Arsenic. It should be administered in a dose of four globules in a teaspoonful of water; and if, after tlhis has been taken, the sufferings are still aggravated, the dose should be repeated at the end of half an hour; but if, on the contrary, the state remains the same, it should not be repeated until the end of two or three hours; if there is an amelioration, a new agglravation must be waited for, and the dose ought not to be repeated before its appearance. In cases in which Arsenic exercises no influence, though repeated several times, recourse must be had to Belladonna; Senna also frequently proves efficacious. 8 [Page 90](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/92) 90 EXTERNAL INJURIES. Against chronic affections arising from tile bite of a serpent,.Phospholr. ac. anld lMercury will generally be most beneficial. For the treatment of persons bitten by a mzad dog, after the application of dry heat, as directed and described above, see \"Hydrophobia,\" below. If morbid affections or ulcerations exhibit themselves in consequence of a bite from a rabid man or animal, lhydroh/)hobine, administered in homceopathic doses, will often render essential service. For wounds that are envenoned by the introduction of animal substances in a state of putrefaction, or of pus fr'om the ulcer of a diseased man or animal, Arsenic is generally the best medicine. LastlS, as a PREWVENTIVE against bad effects, when obliged to touchl morbid animal substances, envenonmed wounds, or ulcers of men and animals under the influence of contagious diseases, the best method that can be pursued is the application of dry bzrning heat at a distance. To effect this purpose, it will be sufficient to expose the hands for five or ten minutes to the greatest heat that can be borne; and after this, it will be proper to wash t~hem with soap. The use of Chlorine and muriatic acid, in similar cases, is well known. HYDROPIIOBIA.-Apply distant heat to the recent wound, as described under \"Poisoned Wounds,\" or until shudderings appear; and continue this practice three or four times a day, until the wound is healed, without leaving- a colored cicatrix. At the same timle the patient should take, every five or seven days, or as often as the agguravation of the wound requires it, one dose of Blelladonna or Lacchesis, or also of llydrophobine, until the cure is completed. If, at the end of seven or eight days, a small vesicle shows itself under the tongue, with feverish symptoms, it will be necessary to open it with a lancet or slharp-pointed scissors and to rinse thfe mouth with salt and water. [Page 91](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/93) FROZEN LIMBS, ETC. 91 If tlme raging sta.te has commened before atssistancnr can be procured fot tle patient, the mcdicines ought to be carefully administered according to circumstances, especially B.ellad. or Laclesiss; or else, again, Cczdtharides, ]fyoscy(a'Zs, afercury, or also Stramon. or Veratrtnr. 7. FROZEN LIMIBS, ETC. If limbs, ears, fingers, nose, etc., are frost-bitten, rub them with snow, or put them in the coldest water, and then, by degrees, let the water be warmer, until a natural feeling returns again. If the person is in a state of insensibility frono being frlozen APPARENTLY TO DEATH, undress him carefully (cut the clothes off from him) and cover him all over with snow, leaving the mouth and nostrils free. As the snow melts, renew it. If no snow can be had, put him into a bath of water, cold as ice, in which he may lie from ten to fifteen minutes; afterward, continue to rub with snow, or cover him with bags containing pounded ice. If in this way, the body has thawed by degrees, and the rigidity of the muscles relaxed, dry the body carefully, and place it in a cold bed in a cool room, and begin to rub, under the bedclothes, with the warm hands only, all over. In this way continue for hours. If signs of life show themselves, inject a little camphor and water; also, put a drop of spirits of camphor on the tongue, from time to time. If more signs of life appear, give warm black coffee (without milk), by injection, and small quantities through the mouth, until he can take more by degrees. If severe pains in the whole body appear, give Carbo veg. (twelve glob. dissolved in half a teacupful of water), every fifteen or twenty minutes a teaspoonful, in alternation with Arsenic, if necessary, until better. The patient must avoid the heat of fire or of a stove for some time. [Page 92](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/94) EXTERNAL INJURIES. II. POISONS. Of the poisonous substances which can be introduced into LIe syst.es-m, those are thle most deleterious and pernicious wlhicl have the readiest facility of assimilation; consequently, the aninmal poisons rank first, then come the vegetable, and, lastly, the mineral poisons. rThe aninmal poisons show their effects immediately on the nervous system, through the blood. The poison of snakes, for instance, while introduced into the stomaclh, is of no dangerous consequence. The vegetable poisons must be carried into the blood by digestion before their effects become dangerous. The mineral poisons kill only by corroding the surface, willth which they come in contact, creating inflammation, which has a great tendency to pass quickly over into gangrene or mortification;* their bad effects on the system, afterwvard, are more lasting. In cases of poisoning, the first thing to be done is, to eject the poison as soon as possible from the system, by provoking vomiting,+ or, to neutralize its action by means of suitable antidotes. * This peculiarity of the mineral poisons, to kill only by corrosion of the mucous membranes of the intestines, renders their use as remedial agents in diseases quite safe and expedient, as they can easily be divested of this poisoning or corroding quality, by reducing their crude bulk (which alone can corrode or inflame) by trituration and subsequent dilution, without diminishing in the least the curative effects of these minerals. For instance: one grain of Arsenic, in its crude state, would kill; yet, if triturated with one hundred grains of sugar-of-milk. one grain of this mixture would have lost all corroding or poisonous power, retaining, at the same time, all the curative quality, and this in a more developed form. In this way, Homceopathy can avail itself of all the healing effects of the most deadly poisons, with the greatest ease and safety; while Allopathy stands trembling and in fear before these dreadiul agents, not knowing how to tame their useless fury, or to harness these wild medicinal steeds to the car of Esculapius. t That, in such cases, Hlomceopathists make use of emetics and other violent means to eject poisons from the stomach, is not a proof that [Page 93](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/95) POISONS. 9o To produce vomiling, the following means may be resorted to, in preference to the so-called emetics, which the allopathic school has hitherto employed: 1. Tepid water, in large quantities and often repeated. 2. Snuff or mustard, mixed with salt on the tongue. 3. Tickling of the throat with a feather or fine straw; or, lastly, 4. l2jections of tobacco smoke into the anus through a pipestem. To neutralize or mitigate the injurious effects of poison, the following means may be used as each case requires, which will be shown below under the heading of each poison named. i. WThite of Egg, dissolved in water, and thus drank in large quantities, is of the greatest efficacy in poisoning by metallic substances, particularly Corrosive sublimate, Verdigris, Tin, Ars5enic, Lead, Merczury, Sulph]Auric acid, particularly when there are violent pains in the stomach and bowels, with or without diarrhea. In all cases in which the poison imbibed is unknown, the white of an egg is first given when violent pains in the abdomen are present. they resort to allopathic means, as allopathists, quite sophistically, would make people believe. It only shows that, in cases of this kind, the homceopathic law cannot come into operation until these substances are removed, which act, as it were, as external injuries all the time, while they are buried in the stomach. In the same way, Surgery might be pronounced insufficient in its doings, because a surgeon can not heal a wound as long as the knife continues to lacerate andl even enlarge the wound. It is evident that external injurious substances (and such are all poisons) must be removed, just as a burning coal or a stinging blister, before the injuries done to the system can be repaired by the proper homceopathic agents; and this is done by Homceopathy more safely and quickly than by Allopathy, as the knowledge of antidotes is further advanced by the former, which is of the utmost importance in curing the after-effects of the poison.

In cases of poisoning by alkaline substances, it must be ofilttcl as i njurious. 3. Vineeyar (made firom wine or cider) diluted with water, as a draulght or in injections, alternately withl slimy thinos, is thle principal remedy against alkaline substances, but is very injurious in cases of poisoning by minerals (the very-opposite of soa)p-water). 4. Sug'ar, diluted and given in water, can be administered in cases of poisoning by mineral, as well as alkaline substances, and is, therefore, one of the most valuable remedies in domestic practice, as it can be most easily procured. 5. Jiilk and Olive oil are substances not so Vwell calculated to envelop poisons in the stomach, as slimy, mucilaginous drinks, made of pealled barley, linseed, or rice; yet they may be used with advantagce ag'ainst alkaline substances, and corrosive acids, such as Ntitric and Sulpklauric acid. 6. fucilrayinous drinks, in draughts and injections, are very useful against alkaline poisons, particularly in alternation lwil vinegar.

The abuse of medicines, prescribed often by allopathic physicians, and taken in large quantities, for a long time, produces, frequently, artificial diseases, well known under the name \"Medicinal Diseases.\" The most obstinate and deleterious of these maladies are those produced by vegetable drugs, as their quick andC ready assimilation in the stomach, is far greater than that of minerals. From tfhis it is evident how foolish or deceptive the conduct of those physicians is, who pretend to uSe in their practice only 5':egetable medicines,\" as if this kingdom of nature did not contain the most noxious and violent poisons. In the followinUg table, the drugs are put together with their antidotes, which mnay be given as the indications mentioned may require. In administering them, it must be understood, that all these cases are more of a chronic nature' consequently, the repetition of doses is not require i to be made so often, say fi'omn half a day to two, three,, i _re days, until improvement takes place, or another remedy has to be selected. Medicinal diseases are not so easily cured as natural ones, because the reactive force of nature (so important in the treatment of diseases in general) cannot altogether be relied on in cases of this hind.

TUE skin, as the external covering of the whole body, is, on account of its exposure and extent, liable to many and various diseases from the slightest redness, or rash, to the most inveterate itch and leprosy. The importance of its preservation is, therefore, obvious. We divide the diseases of the skin into, 1. Acute Eruptions, Eruptive Fevers, etc. 2. Chronic Eruptions and Ulcers. 1. ERUPTIVE FEVE1ts. Rash. DIAGNOSIS.- Frequently, after taking cold, particularly with a disordered stomach, persons are troubled with a rash on different parts of the body, which appears in red spots, of the size of a pin-head, scarcely visible; however, more so in a warm bed; with intolerable itching, particularly at night, preceded by shivering toward evening, disturbed sleep, and followed by feverishness during the night In such cases, the common practice heretofore has been, and is yet, where Homceopathy is not known, to put scorched flour on the parts affected. This is not, however, without danger, and ought not to be resorted to immediately. It would be better first to give some of the following remedies, which will relieve, without driving the disease to internal parts. (98) [Page 99](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/101) NETITLE IAS11- HI'[ES. 99 TREATMIENT.-If the itching is with either shivering or heat, restlessness, sleeplessness, give Olhanom. every hour one dose (four glob.). If not better within two or'three hours, give Leduc,?p., every two hours a dose (four glob.). If not better next day give BRhus, and Sulphur in alternation, every three hours a dose (four glob), until amelioration takes place. DIET AND REGIIMEN.-The diet ought to be very lightfarinaceous substances, gruels, toasted bread and toast-water -but no meat, or soups of meat. The patient must be kept in a dry, warm room; warm lemonade is recommended. Nettle Rash \u2014Hives. (UVrticaria.) DIAGNOSIS.-A disease similar to the former in origin and appearance, only that the red spots, with a whitish tinge, appear in groups, somewhat elevated, and itch and prick intolerably. Sometimes the body is covered with these spots, and then the patient feels sick, has no appetite, with a feeling of fullness in the pit of the stomach. There exist several varieties of this disease, so well known under the above name of nettle-rash. They are, however, all distinguished by an eruption on the skin, similar to that caused by' the contact of nettles; hence the name. Accompanied with violent itching and burning, elevations appear on the surface of the skin, which are of a round form and whitish yellow color; the skin itself assumes, on these places, a firm texture; these spots are surrounded by a halo of reddish hue. The patient complains, beside, of headache, bitter taste in the mouth, coated tongue, nausea, andl- vomiting; sometimes feverish symptoms appear, preceded by chilliness; this is particularly the case in that form of nettle-rash which is caused by indigestion, errors of diet, and exposure to cold. The patients feel relieved of the gastric and febrile symptoms after the eruption has made its appearance, which frequently is facilitated by vomiting or perspiration. [Page 100](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/102) 100 CUTANEOUS DISEASES. Some persons have a constitutional predisposition for this disease, in as far as they will invariably be attacked by it after eating certain articles of diet; for instance-shell-fish, cucumbers, mushrooms, crabs, clams, strawberries, etc. Others are inclined to it because they have naturally a tender, irritable skin; elderly females, particularly those which in early age suffered much from rheumatism, have a great tendency to it. The duration of this disease varies from one to four and seven days; it is sometimes transient, the eruption vanishing quickly; very often it reappears, and becomes very troublesome. The disease is, generally, not dangerous in its results, and yields readily to the appropriate remedies. This disease frequently appears during an epidemic of Erysepelas, particularly in the hot summer months; in such cases fever is present, preceded by gastric-bilious symptoms, pains in the limbs and arms, headache, drowsiness, sense of fatigue, etc., the patient sometimes even becomes delirious before the eruption appears, after which, however, soon all these alarming symptoms leave. This form of urticaria, generally soon disappears, on the cessation of the fever. TREATMENT. - When caused by indigestion, particularly from rich and fat food, give Pulsatilla, morning and evening (four oglob.). Whren caused by taking cold, and accompanied with diarrhea, bitter taste in the mouth, and slimy coated tongue give Anl:tihao0. cr'l(7. alternately with Dtlcamcnara (four glob.). When caused by taking cold in damp, wet weather, exhlibiting itself with p'ins in the limbs, shivering, and headache, give %Bryonic and Bi/ls, alternately, every three or four hIours a dose (four glob.), followed, ill twventy-four hours, by a dose (four glob.) of Sitwlur)/', if necessary. If not better lhe third day, give, evening and morning, a dose (four glob.) of Ledoln p. When these remedies are of no avail, or there is a burning sensation, wi;h itching', great restlessness, and even an uneasy feeling, of _Apis next day, of a solution of UTrtica urens (one drop ill six tablespoonfuls of water), every three hours a teaspoonful. Sometimes this rash strikes in suddenly, when the patient feels oppressed, sick at the stomach, and weak. In such a case, give immediately, Ipecac. (four glob.); in an hour afterward, Bryonia (four' glob.), and, after that, in two hours, if not better, Arsenic (four glob.). At the same time, cover the patient well, to produce perspiration, which will also be promoted by warm drinks, particularly warm lemonade, if he has no diarrhea at the time. If a person is troubled with this disease for a longer time than common, or liable to it on the slightest occasions, let him take Calcarea, every four days a dose (four glob.), in the evening, and, if not better, in four or six weeks, Lycopodium, Sulphlur, Carbo vegetabilis, Nitric acid, in the same manner. No external application whatever, should be made, as the disease might suddenly strike in, producing serious or even fatal consequences. DIET must be simple; no meat nor heating drinks; nothing but water, black tea, gruels, dry toast, baked apples, and stale bread. Erysipelas, or St. Anthony's Fire. DIAGNOSIS.-It is characteristic of this disease, that it appears suddenly, on different parts of the body, with heat, redness, swelling, tingling, and other painful sensations; in severer cases, the heat becomes intense on the parts affected; the surface almost shines, the pains become burning and shooting, and the skin rises in blisters filled with water (erysipelas bullosum). In such cases, an intense fever is present, with its concomitant gastric nervous symptoms, such as a quick, full, wiry pulse; high fever, preceded by shivering or chill; tongue coated, white or dry' brown; great thirst; pains all over w sleepiness or walkelfiulness; very sensitive to noise and lihllt. The nearer to the brain this disease appears, as on the face, the ears, or the scalp of the heatd, the severer thle symptoms of the head wsill be, and consequently, the more dangerous is the attack, so that delirium often ensues. In the so called \"wandering erysipelas \" (erysijpelas erraticurn), the morbid spot disappears from one place, changing into a yellowish hue, to reappear again on another, in the form of redness and heat, so that il f'requently wanders from the left side of the face, around the ear and neck to the right side, before the whole disease (lisappears. In such cases, the face is very much swollen and disfigured, closing, for a time, the eyes, nose, and ears. If the scalp of the head is attacked, the hair often falls off afterward. CAUSES. - In most cases, exposure to cold immediately after the system has been heated or excited by over-exertion or mental emotions, particularly with a previous derangement of the stomach; or, in females, duringt menstruation. Some persons are predisposed to it. Certain kinds of food, at certain seasons, will also produce it, suchl as lobsters, oysters, and other shell fish; also the abuse of alcoholic liquors. TREATMIENT.-All outward applications ought to be avoided as dangerous \u2014-at any rate, all which are greasy. Inathe use of wet bandages cover the parts well. Salves and ointments are very dangerous. If the itching and burning is too violent, we may mitigate it a little, by applying powdered starch made of wheat flour, but not until after -having, given some of the following medicines internally. The internal remedies are the most important. If the fever is very high, pulse full, skin dry, give first a few doses of Acoiie, one every two hours (four glob.), followed by Belladonna, two doses, one every four hours (four glob.), which, in less severe attacks of this diseasase, is alone sufficient. In such cases, the patient improves aft.er twe!ve or six [Page 103](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/105) ERYSIPELAS. 103 t een 1hours, and no more medicine is needed; he simply remains at home a few days, until there is no more danger of taking cold. In severer cases, however, when after the above treatment the symptoms do not abate, give Lachesis, two doses, every three hours one (four glob.), particularly if the patient complains of dryness in the throat and pain in swallowing; also, couglhs without raising; or Apis mellif. in alternation with it. If no better after this, or if there be great sensitiveness to noise and light; the rash expanding in radiation; shining redness on its surface, which is very sensitive to the touch; sometimes raised in blisters; give Belladonna and Rhius tox. in solution (twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water, each cup having its separate teaspoon), every two hours a teaspoonful, alternately, until four teaspoonfuls of each are taken. Then wait twelve or more hours. If the patient is then very drowsy, give a dose of OpIium (four glob.); or, if very wakeful and restless, give Cof'ea'\"c and Bellad.co' alternately, every hour a dose (six glob.), for three or four hours, and wait again twelve hours; after which repeat Belladonna, and Rhus tox., in solution as above. If the symptoms are yet the same, give two doses of Heplar, every three hours one (four glob.), when the skin looks less shining and inflamed, but heat, pain, and swelling, are the same. The above treatment suits severe cases of erysipelas of the face, head, or ears, with high fever, and, also, the vesicular form, where it appears in blisters, and the \" wandering erysipelas.\" In the latter, however, where we cannot expect so rapidt a termination of the disease, Pulsatilla is often successful, particularly when the skin is more of a bluish red, or the internal or external ear is attacked; also, in those cases which originated from eating noxious articles, such as oysters, clams, etc. If erysipelas appears on the joints, give Bryonia, three doses, every six hours one (four glob.), alternating with Rhus, and followed by Sulphur after thirty-six or forty-eigh hours, one dose (four glob. ), if necessary. [Page 104](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/106) 104 CUTANEOUS DISEASES. If it appears on the scrotum, Arsenic is necessary, administered in the same manner as Bryonia. If the vesicles become gangrenous or of a dark color, the patient is weak, or black diarrhea sets in, iArsenic and Cariio veg. ougllt to be given alternately, every three hours one dose (four glob.), until a homceopathic physician takes chllarlge of the patient. Sometimes a swelling of the affected parts, showing the pressure of the finger, combines itself with erysipelas (erysipelas wdematodes). This requires Rhus tox., in alternation with Apis mellif., twice a day (four glob.) for three or four days. If erysipelas terminates in ulceration of the parts affected, give Rhus and Sulphur alternately, every evening a dose (four glob.) for four days, and, afterward, a dose of Silicea for two evenings, and wash the ulcer three or four times a day with lukewarm water, in half a teacupful of which twelve globules of Silicea are well dissolved. The disposition to this disease will be taken away by the alternate use of Rhus, and Graphites, every four days a dose (four glob.), if continued for four or six weeks. Beside this, however, change the mode of living, if it was too luxurious; avoid highly-seasoned or salted food, drink freely of cold water, and wash and bathe frequently and systematically. APPLICATION Or WATER, as an auxiliary to the homceopathic medication, is confined to the use of the wet sheet, to produce perspiration; this accomplished, a great step in the cure of erysipelas has been gained; no direct application of the cold water on the parts affected, is advisable, except where the burning pain is intolerable, when a wet bandage may be applied, but well covered; too long-continued constipation, treat with injections and drinking of cold water. DIET.-During this disease, the diet should be as in fevers, very light; dry toast, gruels, and black tea; warm lemonade is very good and refreshing, if no diarrhea prevails; stewed prunes may also be allowed, particularly in convalescence. If, at any time during this disease, the bowels are confined, [Page 105](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/107) ERUPTIVE FEVERS. 105 even forl four or six days, it will not exert, in the least, a detrimental effect upon the patient; on;the contrary, it is better than thle opposite state. Avoid taling cold during the convalescence, as it is often followed by dangerous results, dropsies, etc. If, at any time durinog tie attack, the erysipelas suddenly disappears, and the brain, in consequence, becomes affected, which shows itself in drowsiness, difficulty of breathing, and spasmodic twitlcliing's, give Cup29ruzm, in solution (twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water), evely lalf hour a (lose, until a hiomceopatllic plysiciain talies charge of the patient. Before we lelsve this subject, let us here remark, that erysipelas, cas such, is 7-'o ifectcious disease whatever, and has lost its dread enotirely, since homceopathic remedies have been used in t:he e of it. Erulp)tive Fevers with oan iZfecliou3s -itidemic Caraccter. We now come to Ca class of eruptive diseases,which appear, generally, as epi(lemics, and are infectious. Tliese are measles, French measles, scarllet rash, scarlet fever, chicken-0 ox, varioloids and small- po. Their epidemic appearance depends upon the geneeral lawts of disease growing out of the changing conditionls of the seasons an-d atmosphere. As a general rule, we can say thaLt persons are attacked only once in their lifetime witLh these diseases, though some few exceptions may happen. Their contagiousness does not commence, as is generally belie-ved, duling( the fever period, or when the eruption first appealrs; but only c/fer the pustules are well filled, or dlrying up, that is, from the se-enth day onward, to three or four weeks, as long as the system throws out thlough t]he skiil the infectious matter. Before the seventh day of eitlier of tiLe above diseases, no infection can take place, for the same reason as no vaccination is possible out of a pustule before that time. T'he infecting matter must be first fully ripe inr tlhe system before it can affect another; be, therefore, [Page 106](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/108) 106 CUTANEOUS DISEASES. rather more careful during the convalescence of a patient, or after his death (when the contagion is in its highest state of perfection), than in the beginning of his sickness. This is the case as well in measles as in scarlet fever, varioloids and small-pox. Mleasles. (Morbilli.) This eruptive disease so well known under the above name, is preceded mostly by symptoms of a severe cold in the head or a catarrh; the nose begins to run with frequent sneezing, the eyes assume a peculiar watery appearance, with profuse discharge of hot tears; soon a severe cough appears, at first dry, with a metallic sound, afterward more moist and less harsh. These symptoms are accompanied by a more or less severe fever, which increases in intensity toward evening. This first or catarrhal stage of the measles lasts generally three days and is followed by the eruption itself, which appears first on the face and spreads thence over the neck and breast; the exti'emities are generally the last points which are attacked. The eruption shows itself in the beginning in small points, which become larger, as the disease progresses, until they form patches, which are mostly of an irregular, oval, and semilunar shape and of a highly red color. The center of each patch contains a small vesicle, slightly elevated above the surface, which can be easier felt than seen; under the microscope it appears in a half rounded form, filled with a clear and transparent lymph. This stage generally lasts from twenty-four to thirty-six hours. At its close the accompanying fever and catarrhalic symptoms are at their hight; they disappear gradually with the eruption, which looses its intense redness by degrees and generally vanishes entirely at the end of the third day after its appearance. The scaling process which now takes place, is not always perceptible to the eye, although the microscope will reveal the small bran-like scales of the rejected cuticle; an itching on the skin accom [Page 107](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/109) AMEASLES. 107 panies this process, which also terminates the fever and catarrhalic symptoms. This stage is in its duration more indefinite than the former, but may be considered to last generally from six to seven days, during which time the patient must receive as great attention as ever. The above course of the measles is the usual or normal, and generally attended with the least danger. They may be called the catarrhal measles; there are varieties however, which according to their nature, render them more aggravated and dangerous, modifying the treatment materially. The ijeiammatory form appears with a high, full pulse, dry skin and inflammatory symptoms of the respiratory organs. The nervous form has a frequent, small and weak pulse, sometimes burning hot skin, at other times cold extremities, pale face and great debility; the eruption will not appear, and in its stead the patients are taken with spasms in the lungs, resembling asthma, or frequently with real convulsions. These dangerous symptoms disappear, however, as soon as the eruption has fully established itself in the skin. Another variety is the putrid, which is characterized by hemorrhages from the nose and lungs. The blood is generally of a dark color, very liquid, and not coagulable. In this form the eruption appears bluish, and the patients are mostly delirious. Another but less aggravated form is the gastric, where the tongue. is very much coated, the head aches,violently, and the pulse is quick, but soft, sometimes intermittent; the eruption in this variety is rather pale and the skin between the several patches of a yellowish hue. The measles are a contagious disease and appear generally epidemically. The contagion is easily communicated by contact with the patient; it is of a very volatile nature and floats in the air, thus extending the infection over a large space in a short time. A measles epidemic is usually preceded by a hooping cough epidemic; it appears mostly after hard winters in [Page 108](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/110) 108 CUTANEOUS DISEASES. the beginning of spring, particularly when the season is distinguished by unusual dampness. In adults, this disease generally assumes a severer character than in children, because it developes in them more readily those constitutional germs of diseases which often lie hidden in the system a long time, such as consumption, sore eyes, etc. In children, its attacks are rarely dangerous, except when other causes render it complicated, or it is badly treated. The diseases after measles are numerous, and frequently very troublesome, sometimes even dangerous; to avoid their occurrence, ought to be the principle object in the treatment from the beginning. Measles attack a person but once, and this happens mostly in childhood; adults suffer more severely from an attack of measles, than children. TREATMIENT. \u2014In the milder forms of this disease, the catarrhal and gastric, it is sufficient to administer Acoiiite and Pulsatiica in alternation, every two or three hours a dose (four globules), during the two first stages; in the third stage one or two doses of Supl)hur will frequently be beneficial. The nourishment should be light, such as milk and water, gruels, toasted bread, water, black tea, etc. The room must be darkened in such a degree as to make it agreeable for the patient; the temperature be moderately warm, and never oppressively so. The patients ought to be covered well, particularly if the eruption hesitates to make its appearance, yet care must be taken, not to burden them to excess with heavy clothing. If, at any time, there is great restlessness and sleeplessness, introduce a close of Coffeacc, repeating it as often as necessary, particularly in the night. If the cough is very dry and hoarse (resembling croup), give a dose (four glob.) of Hepelar in alternation with Cooa (if the patient is very much agitated and irritalble), at intervals of one or two hours. [Page 109](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/111) MEASLES. 109 If, however, the cough excites severe pain in the upper part of the breast and sides (complication with bronchitis and pneumonia), Aconite and Bryonia (dissolved in water and administered the same as Aconite and Pulsatilla are necessary. If the measles strike in at once and look pale, or if sickness at the stomach and feebleness ensues, give ipecac, and Bryonia alternately, every hour or half hour a dose (four glob.), and if the skin looks bluish brown, give Arsenic and LApis nell. in alternation, every hour or two hours a dose, until better. If the head is affected in children, give Cupruzem, every half hour a dose (three glob.), twice or three times; and if not better in three hours, give Bryonia and Hellebor. nig. in solution (twelve glob. of each to half a teacupful of water) every hour, alternately, a teaspoonful until better. In the third stage the patient may be allowed to be out of bed, but he must not be exposed to the cold and damp, until all the symptoms have disappeared from the lungs, bowels, and skin. The returning appetite may be gratified by degrees. This period of convalescense lasts usually from four to six days. But if the measles appear in a more aggravated form, it needs different remedies from the above, to carry the patient safely through. If the measles are tardy in their appearance give Ipecac and Bryonia, a few doses of each in alternation, particularly if with a sick stomach there is present great prostration, chilliness or feverishness and thirst. If diarrhea is present in such a case, alternate China and Pudsatilla. If in scrofulous children a whitish diarrhea sets in, with drowsiness and a hot head, the patient sleeps with his eyes half open, and has sickness at the stomach on being raised off the pillow, give Brjyonia and Hellebor. in alternately in solution, every two hours a teaspoonful, until the color of the discharges changes to a yellow or green, when a dose of S&tpghur may be given, which will foster the appearance of the eruption. Belladonna is required in those cases where the throat feels dry and painful during swallowing, the patient has a dread of [Page 110](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/112) 110 CUTANEOUS DISEASES. light, thirst and a spasmodic, dry cough; in a high fever with congestions to the head, agonizing restlessness and delirium, this medicine is invaluable. Rhus, in alternation with Belladonna or Bryonia, if the fever attending the eruption assumes the typhoid direction; the tongue is dry and red, skin hot and dry, constant or occasional delirium, cough dry and frequent. Arsenicurnm in alternation with Rhus, when in addition to the above symptoms there is great restlessness, brownish or dark diarrhea and great thirst; while Chiina and Phosphor. acid will suit better for a diarrhea of a yellowish color without pain. If the affection of the lungs approaches an inflammation, give Tartar Ernet. and Phos}phorus followed by Su7phur, if no amelioration takes place in twelve or twenty-four hours. For ear-ache during or after measles give Puasctilla and Mercury; for the mumps and the swelling of the glands on the neck Dulcamara, Belladonna, liercuriuis and Carbo veg. will be sufficient in most cases. During a measle epidemic it is recommended to give Pulsatilla and Aconite as preventives, alternately, every night a dose (from two to four globules); in a great many instances this course has prevented or at least mitigated an attack of this disease. APPLICATION OF WATER in this disease, is, in general, the same as in scarlatina, where the detailed treatment is given. If the cough affects the breast very much, a wet bandage may be applied, well covered; the water for drinking must not be too cold. Disorders consequent cpon lkeasles.-If sensitiveness to light- continues too long after the eruption is out, give Belladonna, morning and evening one dose (four glob.); this same remedy, applied similarly, suits, if the head is affected (congestion of the heacd), in alternation with Straumontium. Constipated, or not too open bowels, are not injurious [Page 111](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/113) FRENCH MEASLES. 11 during or after mucous diarrhea ensues give C/hina, )Mericury, ]Pula.ctilla, Apis mellif., every six hours, until better. If not better, give one or two doses of Sulj]hurevery six hours one dose (four glob.). If the diarrhea is watery, and connected with typhoid symptoms, loss of consciousness, dry tongue, give Arsenic and Phosp)horus in the same manner. If earache ensues, give Pulsatilla, every two or three hours a dose; if this is accompanied by running of the ear, give after Pulsatilla a dose (four glob.) of SulpAhur on two successive evenings, and if not better in two or three days, give Carbo vey. in the same manner. If the glands below and in front of the ear swell (parotitis, or mumps), give Arnica and Rhus every four hours or six hours a dose (four glob.), till better. The remaining cough requires principally Pulsatila, Spongia, Bryonia, Drosera, l/yoscyanmus, whose symptoms must be compared in the \" lMateria Medica.\" See also under \" cough.\" Burning and itching of the skin requires Chamomile, Rhits tox., Arsetnicum, and Sulphur. DIET must be light-as gruels, water (children milk and water), toasted bread; and only gradually more nourishing. N. B. Do not allow the children to go out of the room too early, or even to go to the door or window, or play on the floor; we cannot be too careful to avoid talking cold. As a preventive of measles, give Aconile and Pulsatilla every third day a dose (four glob.), alternately, during the epidemic; it may prevent an attack, and will certainly mitigate its severity. French ifeasles. In this disease, which resembles the former, but is milder in every respect, it is only necessary to mitigate the fever and restlessness, if there is any, with alternate doses (four glob.) of CoGlea and Aconite, one every two, three, or six htours, after which, the eruption soon disappears. [Page 112](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/114) 1 12 CUTANEOUS DISEASES. DIET ArD REGIMEN the sa-ie as in measles, but when complicatedi witll calacrhal symptoms, give a dose or two (four glob.) of Pdsaltilca; and when the head is congested, give a couple of cdoses of Bellaclonna in alternation with Aconite. Scarlet _Rash. This disease is different from scarlet fever, in as far as the redness of the eruption is darker, and the finger, on slight pressure, leaves no white imprint, beside there are numerous small granular elevations, felt under the skin, sometimes distinctly seen. Thllere is another distinctive difference from scarlet fever; this latter appears, invariably, first on the face, next on the body, and lastly on the extremities. Such a regularity is not found in scarlet rash-it may appear irregularly or at once over the whole body. It is frequently and mostly seen in combination with scarlet fever, which is known by its smooth redness on the surface. TREATMENT.-If it appears alone, it is not a dangerous disease, anad yields easily to a few doses of Aconite, every three or four hours one dose (four glob.), and in alternation with Coffea, if there is great restlessness and irritability. If it is combined with scarlet fever, the symptoms sometimes become very severe; see, for their treatment, the next article, \" Scarlet Fever.\" In case it disappears suddenly, Ipecac. and Bryonia should be given, every half hour, or hour, a dose (four glob.), twice or three times, at the same time coveriing the patient well; but when congestion to the head appears, with drowsiness, give Opium (four glob.), or, if the patient starts on closing the eyes, Belladonna (four glob.), once or twice in four hours. APPLICATION OF WATER, the same as in \" Scarlet Fever.\" DIET the same as in measles, and the same caution as regards taking cold afterward. N. B. This disease does not strictly prevent patients froin having the real scarlet fever afterward, although it often [Page 113](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/115) SCARLET FEVER. 113 diminishes their liability to it, as I have had occasion to observe in many instances. It bears the same relationship to scarlet fever, as French measles (or measle-rash, as we may call it) does to ordinary measles. Scarlet Fever. ( Scarlatina. ) A well-known scourge to the world of children, and dread ed by the allopathic physician more than any other. It is not the least triumph of the glorious IHahnemann to have found the true specific against this disease, diminishing its terrors, and furnishing a remedy, which the Allopathists have adopted to a great extent. DIAGNOSIS.-After a fever of more or less severity, characterized by a very quick pulse, and sometimes accompanied with sore throat, headache, thirst, and stupor, or uncommon liveliness, the eruption appears in the form of bright red (scarlet) blotches indefinitely marked, on which, when pressed by the finger, a white spot remains, which soon becomes red again, from the center to the circumference. If it is not combined with scarlet rasll, no grains can be found in the skin by rubbing over it with the hand; it appears, the first day, on the face and neck, the second on the breast and region of the stomach, and the third day, on the arms, hands, and limbs. But more frequently it appears in combination with scarlet rash (see this article), in which case it assumes a more dangerous and destructive character. If this disease exists alone, it generally terminates in five or six days, the skin coming off in large pieces. TREATMENT. -Belladonna is the specific for this disease, which is cured by its use alone, except in complicated cases, The symptoms requiring its use, are dry burning fever, quick pulse, starting on closing the eyes for a few minutes, great thirst, dry, red, or whitish coated tongue, urine scanty and highly colored, scarlet eruptions on the face, or over the entire body. Sometimes this external redness does not appear, 10 [Page 114](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/116) 114 CUTANEOUS DISEASES. but instead of it the throat is mnore or less affected, in which case the tongue hlas always a reddish gloss. Yet, even this wandkering, of the scarlatina from the outside skin to the mucous memnbrane of the throat, does not materially increase the danger of the case, if the glands only do not enlarge too much. Under all thlese circumstances, as indeed always at first, give Belladona'/f in the following manner: Dissolve twelve globules in h1alf a teacupful of water, and give of this solution every two, three, or four hours, a teaspoonful for four or six times. If the disetase gets worse soon after giving Belladonna, discontinue its use, or let the patient smell of spirits of camphor a few timies and do not recommence the use of Belladonna, until the child gets worse again; this, however, will not generally be found necessary. In this mn-ner continue to use the Be7ladonna for three or four days, until the scaling process commences, when it is only necessary to keep the patients away from the slightest drauglht: it is by far the safest to keep them in bed closely for four or five days after the fever has left, when a dose of Sulphr1' (four glob.) may be given to complete the cure. But if the case is a comuplicated one from its beginning, or becomes so in its progress, other remedies beside Belladonna are needed. Cases of this kind ought to be treated by a homceopathic physician; yet, where none is to be had, the following prescription will be found beneficial: If there is great restlessness and sleeplessness, irritability, vwhining, and tossing about, give Coffea and Belladonna in solution (twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water), alternately, every hour a teaspoonful; or, if there is violent fever, with dry heta, fuill and quick pulse, congestion of the head, occa sional delirium or lethargy, with starting when awaking, and dry, short, painful cough, give Aconite and Belladonna in solution, alternately, in the same manner. If the patient is better under this treatment during the daytime7, but in the night these symptoms appear more or less, [Page 115](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/117) SCARLET patientu is morie composed. If, witih great dr-owsiness and tossing about, the tongue is very dry, t.hirs, great, jwith swelling of gland s on the, neck increasing', skin shining on tn e face anid neck, head thrown backward, and'almost constant dluliriiunm, give Jiu..s and Belladonzna in solution in the samie mann-er as,above, every hour a teaspoonful, alternately, for six or eigiht hours, followed by Cofteac c' and BeiiadonnaQCz; if very restless during the night, as above, this prescription repeated every day for three or four days, secures, in most cases, a favorable issue; perspiration sets in, and thlen one or two doses of Su'l7zar (four glob. are nlec;sary to comvplete the curie. If this disease is combined with scarlet rash, as it mostly is at present, the symptoms become more severe, the throat is affected inside and the glands swell outside, sometimes to a great extent. We call this the nzclignant scarlet fever. In such cases, when ulceration of the glands commences, indicated by a very offensive smnell, and a greatb quantity of mucus ru1nning f1rom the mouth, give.i-ercuzryy (twelve glob. dissolved in half a, teacupful of water), every two hours a teaspoon ful, for six or eighLt times alone, or alternatiln n with Belladanonn.ta, if the patient starts or jerks on closin g the eyes, cannot swallhowy liquids easily, lhas violent thirst, with sensitiveness to limolt. If no improvement takes place within twelve hours, give NiRtr'ic acid in solution the same as JMercury, twice or three times, and then wait six or eight hours, giving in tile meanwhile, only lan occasional dose (four glob.) of CofEaCc and Belladcon'noC:, alternately, if the patient is very rIestless. If no better at the end of'-that time, restlessness still increasing, the saliva excessively fetid, with gratinag of teeth, (i\\rve Arsenic and Laclesis alternately in solution, in tile same manner as lVerectry, and after that, in the same manner, give [Page 116](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/118) 116 CUTANEOUS DISEASES.,itric acid and Lyco'opoclium, particularly stupor of tile p)atielt increa. ses and letlarigy sets in. If, in thlis coldiio:l, tile Iibreathinl, resembles snoring, with burning heat of the skin, whether dry or covered with perspiration, give Camcnhor and Oilium in solution (twelve glob. of each, separately dissolved in half a teacupful of water), every half hour a teaspoonful, alternately; give of each three or four times, and after that, Bryonia and Hellebor. in alternation, (twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water), in solution, every hour a teaspoonful. If, at any time, during this disease, a kind of stranguria (difficulty of urinating) ensues, give Cantharides (four glob.) once or twice, and in alternation with Cogf'ea, if there is great restlessness and irritability, if not better, give Conium in the same mannner. If croupy symptoms appear, give Aconite and Hepar sulph., alternately, every hour a dose (four glob.), until better. APPLICATION OF WATER. - In all eruptive fevers the use of water as a remedy has proved to be very beneficial, and is particularly so in combination with homlceopathic medication. In very severe cases of Scarlet Fever we would recommend;ts use, especially when the fever is intense and the reactive force of the system impeded, or when a repercussion of the eruption has taken place. We insert the treatment as directed by Dr. Munde, a very experienced hydropathist, who treated thus hundreds of Scarlet Fever patients successfully; it supports Homceopathi, medication veiy much. The patient is wrapped in a wet sheet and well covered with blankets; he remains in this position, until perspiration ensues, when he is washed off in milk-warm water; if the throat is inflamed, a cooling bandage is placed on it during the perspiration and renewed every five minutes. If the first packing does not promote perspiration, the wet sheet is renewed until perspiration ensues. In this perspiration he remains until the heat in the head and throat increases or [Page 117](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/119) SCARLET FEVER. 117 difficulty of breathing ensues, when he is unpacked and washed off, as stated above. This whole process is repeated as often as the fever reappears in a high degree. Sometimes a sitting.-bath of milk-warm water of one half or three-fourths of an hour duration is applied, if the pains in head and throat are severe. As soon as the perspiration appears, the patient may be considered to be out of danger. In case the scarlet strikes in suddenly, the patient is sponged off in cold water all over, and if spasms had ensued, cold water is dashed over him in larger quantities, until the spasmodic action ceases; he is then wrapped, without being dried or rubbed, in woolen blankets, and, if possible, as much cold water given, internally, as he can drink; in most cases a general perspiration will ensue, the eruption reappears and the patient is saved. Diseases consequent upon Scarlet Fever and Scarlet Rash. Earachle and Ulceration in the E'ar.-For severe pains in the ear, give Belladonna, Pulsatilla, and Hepar sulph., alternately, every two hours one dose (four glob.), until better. For the running of the ear (otorrhcea), give Lycopodium six times, every evening and morning one dose (four glob.), wait three or four days, and if no better, give Silicea in the same manner. For the swelling of the glands below, and in front of the ear (mumzps), give Carbo veg. and Rhus, alternately, every four or six hours a dose (four glob.), until two doses of each are taken. If a child after this disease evinces symptoms of dropsy of the brain (head hot, extremities cold, vomiting on moving, with or without diarrhea, sleeps with eyes half open), give Blyoia and Hfellebor. n., in solution (twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water) every two hours, alternately, a teaspoonful until it gets more lively again and the above symptoms disappear, when a dose (four glob.) of Sulphur will be serviceable. [Page 118](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/120) 118 CUTANEOUS DISEASES. In case of drop2sical swelEing of the whole body, give first Hlellebor. and Belladonna in the same manner as above, and afterward Bryonia and Hellebor., alternately, then Apis rnellif. n such cases Arsenic, acid and Suljphur are also useful; commence with Arnica, of which two doses may be given, one in the evening and one in the morning (four glob.); and then wait one day until signs of improvement show themselves. If these do not appear, give the other remedies one after another in the same manner. Keep the patient always covered during this treatment. For soreness of the nose and face, with swelling of the glands under the chin, give first Mercury twice, every evening a dose (four glob.), then wait two or three days, and if necessary, give one after the other, Hepar sulph., Silicea, Sulphur. and Calcarea. If the scarlet strikes in suddenly, the eruption assuming a livid bluish hue, and the child becomes drowsy, with hurried breat;hing, give first Bryonia and Belladonna, a couple of doses, every half hour a dose (four glob.), and then if no better give Cuprum in solution (twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water) every fifteen or thirty minutes a teaspoonful. If not better in two hours, continue the same with Camphor in alternation, and cover the patient well. DIET AND REGIMEN the same as in measles; examine closely \"N. B.\" at the end of article on \"Measles.\" As a preventive against scarlet fever, give, during the prevalence of the disease, to every child a dose (four glob.) of Belladonnacc every other evening. N. B. It is hardly necessary to urge the necessity of the advice and attendance of a homceopathic physician in this disease, if one can possibly be obtained. It frequently occurs, that before the eruption comes out, convulsions set in which seem to threaten the life of the patient. In such a case give Belladonna and Cuprum in alternation (twelve globules of each dissolved in half a [Page 119](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/121) CHICKEN-POX. 119 teacupful of water) every ten or fifteen minutes, half a teaspoonful, until better; E2rtar emetic, if the convulsions are accompanied with vomiting and diarrhea, cold, clammy skin, and hurried respiration; beside, treat the patient as directed under the heading \" Convulsion\" in \"diseases of children.\" As soon as the eruption appears more distinct, the congestion to the head, and with it the convulsion, ceases; cases of this kind, commencing apparently so unfavorably, terminate nevertheless most favorably, as the worst of the disease appeared in the beginning, where the patient had more power to overcome it. Chicken-Pox. (Varicella.) DIaGNosIs.-This eruption is often mistaken for small-pox or varioloid, particularly when a small-pox epidemic is raging. We will give the differences between them. Before the chicken-pox appears, the patient is only sick from twentyfour, to forty-eight hours, and then he has, generally, fever and headache, with bilious rheumatic symptoms, without the severe swvimming in the head and the backache, which never fail to appear before the small-pox breaks out. Instead of that, he complains of stranguria and tenesmus (see glossary), which is not the case in small pox. The chicken-pox appears irregularly on different parts of the body at once, while the small-pox and varioloid always appear on the face first. Again, the pustule of the chickenpox appears at once in the form of a bladder, not as in smallpox and varioloid, in the form of a point like the head of a pin. When the chicken-pox is developed, the pustule has but one cavity, without any inner divisions, containing the clear liquid, and without a dent on the top of it; while the pustule of the small-pox contains the liquid in divisions, like an orange, and has a dent on top. The liquid of the chickenpox very seldom becomes turbid or mattery, as is the case in small-pox, but dries up in a spongy crust, without leaving a mark; the crusts of small-pox are hard, and oftentimes leave [Page 120](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/122) 20 CUTANEOUS DISEASES. marks. Chicken-pox is not contagious in the same manner as small-pox; it depends, for its propagation, more on individual predisposition, strengthened by atmospheric influence. TREATMENT.-For the fever, prior to the eruption, give Aconite and Belladonna every two or three hours, alternately, a dose (four glob.), until three doses of each are given. If the patient complains of bilious rheumatic symptoms, give Bryonia and Rhus, alternately, every two hours a dose (foul glob.), until three doses of each are given. If there are bilious nervous symptoms, give Belladonna and PRhus, alternating in the same manner. If tenesmus is present, give MercurGy, every two hours one dose (four glob.). If there is strangruria, give Cantharides and Conium, alternately, every two hours a dose (four glob.), until three doses of each are given, or the patient is relieved. If the eruption is very considerable, give two doses of Antimon. crud., every twelve hours one (four glob.). DIET AND REGIMEN as in measles. N. B. In children severe symptoms of the head may appear, for instance, convulsions (see this article) or the eruption might strike in; in the latter case, treat it as stated in measles striking in. (See article \"Measles.\") Chickenpox may occur more than once in a lifetime. Small-Pox. (Variola. ) This disease has four important stages, which we will first describe, giving their treatment afterward. First. Febrile Stage. - This commences, generally, from seven to fourteen days after the exposure to the contagion, with a chill more or less severe, after which, intense fever sets in with severe pains in the head acid smnall of the back, aching in the bones and general soreness; dry, hot skin, great thirst, cough, oppression in the stomach, sometimes vomiting of bile; light hurts the eyes, with swimming' of the [Page 121](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/123) SMALL-POX. 121 Lhead; the mind wanders, is flighty, anxious expression of countenance and great prostration of strength. Second. E~ruptive Slage. \u2014After the febrile stage has lasted from forty-eight to seventy-two hours, the eruptive stage commences, by the appearance of small red pimples on the forehead and face of the size of pin-heads, after which the severity of the fever symptoms abates gradually. On the first day the eruption appears on the face; the second, on the breast and body; and the third, on the limbs and arms \u2014this stage, ftherefore, lasts three days. Third. ASigce of,Supp2uration. The pustules now grow to perfection, as large as a bean cut in two; the liquid inside is contained in cells like an orange, on top is a little dent, and around them a red circle. This stage lasts three days; but as thle pustules first appear on the face, then on the breast, and lastly on the extremities, they are already in perfection on tlhe face whlen they are still filling on the breast and Jgrowinog on the extremities. Thus, a wise Providence has divided the burthen in three parts, whllichi would otherwise be unbearable. At the end of this period, the liquid in the pustules is turbid and mattery. Fourth. Stage of Desiccation.-On the eighth or ninth day the eruption begins to dry up; some of the pustules burst, and with the formation of scabs desiccation commences and progresses until the tenth day, at which time, in favorable cases, the fever has entirely disappeared, the swelling of the face has diminished, the scabs have fallen off the upper part of the body, leaving marks of a reddish-brown color. This is the regular and favorable course of the disease whliere the pustules are not so numerous as to run together; but where the small-pox is cofn/luent, the danger of the case and its duration are considerably increased. TREAT MENT. \u2014F.FIebOie Stcae.-During the chill and the first six hours of the fever, give Aconite, every two hours a dose II... I.___._;._._~._,,_~..._._,._~..~.,.~.,;.,,~ _~~.~~~.,..,, [Page 122](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/124) 122 CUTANEOUS DISEASES. (four glob.). headache (congestion), with sensitiveness to liglht, and delirium, are present, alternate with Belladonna, in the same manner. If, afterward, severe backache ensues, with pains in the boles and general soreness (bilious rheumatic), give Bryonia and Rhus, alternately, every two or three hours a dose (four glob.), for twelve or sixteen hours. This is generally sufficient. If, however, there is vomiting, give one dose (four glob.) Tart. emet. If the headache increases to insensibility, stupor ensues, and snoring-like breathing, give one or two doses of Optiinm, every two hours one (four glob.). If the patient is very restless, sleepless, and irritable, give Coff'ea'c' and BelladonnacC,, every hour a dose (four glob.) until better. TREATMENT OF THE SECOND OR ERUPTIVE STAGE. - If the delirium, which may have lasted up to this time, does not disappear entirely when the eruption comes out, or if the eruption does not appear sufficiently or not at all, give Stranzonium, in solution (twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water), every two hours a teaspoonful, for twelve hours. If the lungs suffer, at this stage, with a hoarse, rattling cou0gh, give Tart. emet., a few doses, every two hours one (four glob.); if with great oppression on the chest, give i4pecac. in the same manner. In children, this stage requires particular attention, and Belladonna, in alternation with Stcramonium, should be given, every two hours a teaspoonful of each (ten glob. in half a teacupful of water), until the eruption is out. If, however, this stage progresses finely, without severe symptoms, give nothing but Tart. eret. and'izrja, in alternation, every three hours a dose (four glob.), until six doses of each are taken. These remnedies have the specific power to mitigate the eruption, from the similar eruption they produce [Page 123](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/125) SMALL-POX. 123 on the healthy. Still more powerful acts, in this respect, the Vaccizince, shortening the disease perceptibly and preventing the pitting of the face. TREATMENT OF THE THIRD STAGE. -S-ppuration.- If this stage has a great deal of fever, give Mfercury, every three hours a dose (four glob.) until four doses are taken, particularly when there is abundant saliva in the mouth. The swelling, of the eyes only requires ablutions of warm water and milk. If, however, in this stage, the skin between the pustules becomes of a livid hue or dark brown, and the pustules themselves are watery and flabby (black small-pox), give.Arsenic in solution (twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water), every two hours a teaspoonful, alternating, in the same manncr, with China, if diarrhea ensues. After these remedies, a dose of Sclph2ur (four glob.) will be of service. Thlis treatment is also serviceable, if, in the confluent form, typhoid symptoms occur, with brown, cracked tongue; in which case give, in the absence of diarrhea, instead of China, ha/us in alternation with Arsenic. SZtriking in of the eruption happens in this stage more than in anlly other, an(l ought to be treated with Cupr., as directed in' \" Scarlet Fever \" (see this article). TREATMENT OF THE FOURTH STAGE.- Desiccation.- In the beginning of this stage, give a dose (four glob.) of Sulplzhur; if thle patient is tolerably comfortable, he does not require anytling more than cleansing the skin by frequent ablutions with tepid water, and a careful attention to diet. If, however, the diarrhea continues, give Mercury in alternation with Sulpl)hur, every three or four hours a dose (four glob.) until better. The itching at this period is alleviated by R]hus tox., and by Sulph., evening and morning one dose (four glob.). If the patient has reached this period in a typhoid state, he must be treated accordingly. (See \" Typhus.\") [Page 124](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/126) 124 CUTANEOUS DISEASES. APPLICATION OF,WATER.-Thle wet sheet, as applied in scarlet fever, is in this disease of great service, as also the application of the wet compress under the head and neck, if the eyes and ears suffer a great deal. The wet sheet is repeated every day, as also the ablutions in milk-warm water after the sweating process; sometimes it is necessary to repeat it twice a day, if the disease has assumed a nervous, putrid character. Constipation is relieved by injections and drinkino of cold water. DIET AND REGIMEN.-The room of the patient should be kept well ventilated, not too warm, and almost dark, during the whole time. The diet should be more cold than warm; for instance, water, ice-cream as much as wanted, lemonade, oranges (the latter three not in diarrhea), gruels, dry toast; also, wellstewed prunes and roasted apples; animal food is not allowed, even long after convalescence. Diseases which may occur after small-pox, such as consumption, diarrhea, inflammation of the eyes, etc., see under their proper heads. As a preventive against this disease, vaccination is well and favorably known; for how long a time, however, this may prevent small-pox, is yet a matter of speculation. It varies, certainly, in different individuals; the shortest period may be seven years s; the longest is not known. I consider vaccination and revaccination from time to time, our Li lty and a safeguard against the encroachments of this fe'al-ftl disease; Vaccnincoc internally given is prophylactic. N. B. This disease is similar, in all respects, to the former, yet not the same. It is decidedly milder, and requires no mention of a difi'erent treatment from that given under \" Small Pox.\" (See this article.) [Page 125](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/127) CH-ROtNC ERUPTIONS. 125 N. B. A person' who is well vaccinated may, when exposed to small-pox, taLe the varioloid; and, thus far, vaccination, which is a protection against small-pox, seems not to prevent the varioloid, although one who has had the small-pox will very seldom take the varioloid. The varioloid rarely leaves scars on the skin. 2. CHRONIC ERUPTIONS. To give a detailed description of all the varieties of cutaneous diseases coming under the above head, would be of no advantage for domestic practice, as most of these chronic skin diseases require the most skillful discrimination of an attending physician; for the reason that their causes and character are too deeply connected with the patient's constitution (in each case, perhaps, differently so); and, thus, it is almost impossible to generalize them and their treatment, within the limits of a medical guide-book like this. We will describe some of the most familiar ones, advising the reader, at the same time, to apply to a homceopathic physician immediately on finding his own treatment insufficient, because all chronic cutaneous affections require immediate and proper treatment. Irritation of the Skin.-Itching. (Pruritus.) A fine rash under the skin, scarcely perceptible, and colorless, produces a very disagreeable and distressing itching, particularly at night, when undressing, or in bed after getting warm. It is caused, mostly, by exposure to the extremes of heat and cold, and appears, consequently, in the height of summelr, as well as in winter. Sometimes, the eating of too Inuch fat or greasy food produces it: if so, the diet ought to lhe chang'ed. T'.REATMENT.-Wash, every evening before going to bed, \\it!l water aend plelnty of Castile soap, witliout drying it off. if t.his does inot relieve within four or six days, try brandy or [Page 126](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/128) 1 26 CUTANEOUS DISEASES. alcohol, in the same manner (but take care not to come in contact with a light). If this does not give any relief, wash with water mixed wituh Spgirits of Camtp/hor. Internally, administer as follows: If the irri-tation is worse in the warmth of the bed or near thle fire, particularly after scratching', give Pulsatilla, every evening a dose (six glob.), and, also, if fat food may have caused it. If it commences after going to bed, and resembles flea bites all over the body, the pain shifting from one part to another, Ledum. p.,. given in the same manner, will be of service. lffercury suits, when it continues througll the whole night, and after sc,'atchinc bleeds easily and freely; in this case alternately with Ca.uslticurm, every other evening, one dose (four glob.) for a week. If an intolerable 6urning accompanies the irritation, amounting almost to feverishness, take Bryonia and Rhtus, alternately, every six (four' glob.) for or thirty-six hours; two days after take Ielar sulph1A., evening and morning a dose (six glob.). If not better in four or six days after, take Carbo vey., evening and morning, one dose (six glob.). If it commences when undressing, take iVux vomica and.Arsenic, in alternation. If old people are troubled with it, give Opium and Secale, alternately, every evening a dose (four glob.). If it renders the patient very restless, so that he perspires, take Colocynth. If it is caused by summer heat, take Lachesis and Lycopodium, alternately, every evening a dose (four glob.). If it is accompanied with fine sritches, like needles, take Ticuja, every evening a dose (four glob.), for two evenlngs. If it does not yield to one of the above remedies, take Silicea, every third evening a dose (four glob.), until four doses are taken. If then not better, take Sullphur, in the same m anner.

DIaCN oss.-Chlilblains mostly appear on hands and feet which have been fiost-bitten, -and are extremely painful if they burst and ulcerate. TriEATMENr.-If the parts begin to swell, assuming' a dark, reddish \u2014brown colors, with itching and beating, worse in the eveninog or at nioht, take Pulsatilla, in solution (twelve globules in half a teacupful of water), morning, noon, and evening' a teaspoonful, an(l occasionally wash the parts affected in a teaspoonful of the solution. In a few days afterward, take Rhtust, ea.vning and morning, a dose (four glob.). If the parts have a bright red color, and itch more in the warmth, take Nitx vomica, in the same manner. If these remedies do not relieve, give Phosphorus alone or in alternation with HIe,)ar s8tlhl., if ulceration has commenced. If I.the parts are very painful and burning, take Chamonz.ile.alone, every three or four hours, a teaspoonful-, or alternately witlh A;secnic, in the same manner, if not relieved scoon. If the swelling is hard and shining, take Arnica internally, and wasll externally with two drops of the tincture to a teaspoonflul of -water, the same as Pdsatilla.

If ulceration sets in, dress externally thl e parts with poultices or other mild applications, until relieved. Ecooriaions. (Intertrigjo.) If they appear during the summer, evening a dose (four glob.) for two days, and then wait two days for its effect-taking the next in the same manner, and so on until better. Ckqgfing of bed-lridden paltients (bed sore) requires Arnica (ten drops of the tincture to half a teacupful of water), externally applied, with cloths dipped into the mixture. At the same time place a soft, tanned deerskin under the sheets of the bed, the hairy side down. If the affected parts look bluish, and there is danger of mortification, give China internally, in alternation with Caro I ve,., every four or six hours a dose (four glob.), and wash externally, with a solution of Silicea (twelve globules in half a teacupful of water), several times a day. Disposition to fester. \u2014There exists in some persons a disposition of the skin to fester, if the slightest injury has taken place, or ulcers do not heal. In suchl a case, give of the following remedies every week, on two succeeding eveningHs, one dose (four glob.), admilnistered in the same manner. Cracked skin, from cold in the winter, requires FPerol., Sulphur, in the same manner; also eI yes circienatus.)

DIET as in chilblains. Itch. (Scabies.) Not every eruption or pimple that itches is the itch; a malady so much dreaded in a family, that everything is welcomre, an(d indiscriminately used, which will tend to eradicacte this loathsome disease; and thus salves and ointments xithout number are used, but not without danger. Even if arparently cured by these salves, it is only driven into the system, layino. the foundation for innulnerable diseases afterward. Tl1erefore, never do anything of this kind, under anly consideration. First, be sure that it is the real itch, which is contagious. Frequently, it is only a disease described in the -article on \" Itching.\" DIAGNosls.-T'he real itch appears in pointed vesicles, filled witii a transparent serous fluid, mostly about thle wrists, between the fingers, and around the joints. The itching increases in thle evening, especially in the warmth of the bed. It never appears on the lace. TREATMiENT.-SnllAhur is the specific for it.

Repeat this treatment if, after a week, no improvement has taken place; but, then, alternately with Mc]ercury internally, as above. If, after another week, there is no improvement, and the eruption is yet small and dry, take Carbo veg., for eight days, every other evening a dose (six glob.), and, afterward, if necessary, Hleparl sulqph., in the same manner; but if, during this time, pustules have made their appearance, give Caustic, in the samle manner. The pustular or humid variety generally spreads more over the body, and also appears frequlently on the back, shoulders, arms, and thighs. In this form Sulphur and Lycopodium are necessary, given, as stated above, in \"Sulphur and M~ercury,\" for eight days; then wait eight days, and, if no better, take Caustic, and, after it, lilercury, in the same manner. Sepia, internally and externally, applied in the same manner as Sulphur, has frequently been beneficial when nothing else seemed to have the desired effect. When the pustules are large, and turn yellow and blue, take Lachesis, for several evenings a dose (six glob.). When the itch has been suppressed by external applications, and dangerous results threaten, give Sulphur and Arsenic, in alternation, every evening a dose (six glob.). In obstinate cases, apply to a homceopathic physician. APPLICATION OF WATER internally and externally is, in this disease, of the greatest benefit; bathing and washing daily are essential; beside, the patient can perspire in the wet sheet twice a day with a cold sponge-bath after it. If possible, he ought to take a sitting-bath of half an hour's duration, before goilng to bed. Drinking of cold water is recommended. Milk-crust. ( Crusta lactea.) This disease, as, in fact, all chronic eruptions of any extent, oug1ht to be treated by a skillful hon-opathic physician; yet [Page 132](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/134) 13 0 2 CUTANEOUS DISEASES. we will here in;cert as much of the treatment as will warrant its rational commencenment and often favorable termination. DIAGNoSIS. \u2014 It consists of numerous small, whitishl pustles, appearing in clusters upon a red basis, first on the face, the clheeks and forehead, but spreading, afterward, over the whole head and otlier parts of the body. The redness and swelling flrequently increase, and, withl it, the itching becomes intolerable, particularly if a largle part of the face and head is covered withll the eruption. In such cases, the glands on the nech and under the ears enlarge in consequence. Children, from four to eighteen months of age, are liable to it. TREATAMENI'.-.pi?,(t is the principal medicine, of which three doses, each of four globules, are to be given every d:iy. Tthis treatment I have found very ecfficacious in numerous cases. in most of which the disease disappeared within three or four weeks. i-f the child at any time is very restless, and the itching seems to be very agg'ravated, particularly at night, give Aco1ite::and Cthcraogile, alternately, every two hours a dose (two glol,. ) until better. It! the running of the eruption suddenly dries up, and the chiild becomes drowsy, sleeps with eyes half open, has a hot head and cold feet, give BRyonia and ftileC)or. n... as directed under the head of \"'Measles.\" Externally,,apply notlhing buL a little sweet creaml, or wash occasionally with weah sowapsuds. Alothers-feel very much annoyed at the first appearance of this certainly very disagreeable eruption, fearing that it would injure the complexion, etc.; but this is not the case, for the complexion becomes very fair after its disappearance. Scald-it eacl. (Riny-worme of the Scall.) (7inea capitis.) There of this di-sease; but for pIacticl 1a'tpo<.ses, the CORNS. 133 DIAGNOSIS.-It,appears, generally, hairy part of the head, in numerous yellowish pustules, finally forming a thick crust covering the head and neck of children from two to fourteen years of age: bad as it is, and obstinate to cure, yet its sudden disappearance, after the application of violent external means, creates worse internal disorders, and frequently even death. It is highly contagious; be careful even with the articles of clothing, particularly on the patient's head; let no other child come in contact with them. It generally lasts a long time, and ought to be treated by a skillful homoeopathic physician. TREATMENT. - First institute the treatment given under \"Milk-crust,\" and continue it for four weeks; if no amelioration takes place during that time, give, if the eruption is of the dry kind, Calcarea carb., every third evening a dose, (six glob.) for two weeks, and then, if there is no sign of improvement, give Sul2phur in the same manner. If it is the running scald-head, give Lycopodiurm, and afterward Suljphur, in tihe same manner. If scrofulous symptoms appear, such as swelling of the glands on the neck and throat, give Bryonia and Dulcamara, alternately, every six hours a dose (four glob.) until better. If the discharge of the eruption is very corrosive, causing ulcers, give Arsenic and Rhus in alternaticn, every evening and morning a dose (four glob.), and wash with a solution (twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water) of each medicine, applying it to the edges of the scab, while giving it internally. APPLICATION OF WATER.-See \"Tetter.\" DIET AND REGIMEN. \u2014The usual homceopathic diet must be adhered to strictly. (See \"Introduction.\") Thle hair ought to be removed in the beginning of this disease. Corns. ( Clavi pedis.) Induration of the SXcin. Corns on the Feet.-If they will not disappear after several cuttings and applications of Arnica tincture (six drops mixed [Page 134](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/136) 134 CUTANEOUS DISEASES. with two tablespoonfuls of water, or Arnica plaster) an internal treatment must be resorted to for their eradication. First, take Antimon. crud., every evening a dose (six glob. ), if the pains are more pressing, and as if needles were running througtl the corn. If lthe pain is of a burning nature, take Calcareea car&b., every other evening a dose (four glob.). If they are inflamed, take Lycopodium, Sepia, Silicea in the same manner, taking every week another remedy if necessary. If they are particularly troublesome in wet weather, take first.1ryonia and Rlhus, alternately, every two hours a dose (four glob.), for eight hours, and then twelve hours afterward a dose of Sulp-hur. I2duration of the skin.-Sometimes the skin indurates (gets callous) on tile hands and feet, becomes painful and peels off \u2014in such cases, take Graplhites internally, every second evening a (lose (four glob.), until four doses are taken, and use externally the same remedy (twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water well shaken) three times a day. IITarts. ( Verruccte.) Neither cauterize nor cut these excrescences; it is too dangerous; a better remedy is the application of the tincture of Rhus on the wart three times a day. They will quickly disappear. If they do not disappear within four or six weeks, resort to the internal use of the following remedies: Causticunm, if the warts are fleshy or seedy. Antimonium crud., if they are flat, hard or brittle. Dulcamara, if they are on the back of the fingers. Calcarea, if on the sides. ADMINISTRATION.-Take of a remedy every other evening a dose (four globnles), for eight days. Whzillows on the Fingers. Felons. (Panaris.) This disease exists in the form of an abscess, more or less [Page 135](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/137) ULCERS. 135 deeply seatecd, on thle end of the finger, attended with severe pain anicd considerable swelling. In the beginnin,, its formation may frequently be pre-'vented by dipping tile fingel quickly into water almost boiling, or by wrappirng around iit finely-powdered wood soot made wet with alcohol, or by washing the finger with a mixture of a drop of creosote in half a teacupful of water. But if ilis does not avail, keep warm bread-and-milk poultice around it all the time until it opens, and take internally, Aiercury, flej)ar sulph., and Silicea, alternately, every six hours a dose (four glob.), for two or three days. After it opens, wash the finger three times a day in water, nll half a teacupful of which twelve globules of S.ilicea are dissolved, or keep the bandage around the finger wet with this solution. ULCERS. We can only give their general treatment here, as their {,rigin and appearance are too various to be discussed in a work on domestic practice. They arise, mostly, from a diseased condition, which must be first changed by systematic internal treatment, before the external sign of it, the ulcer, can heal. When it is forced to close itself by violent external means, the disease, of which it was the expression, attacks internal parts, and the danger is thus increased, as the dignity of the organ affected is greater. Be careful, thereefore, in using salves and ointments. DI1GaNosIs AND TREATMENT. \u2014First. An ulcer may be deep, presentin(g a hollow excavation. In this case fill it once or iwice every day with dry scraped lint, previously cleaning it well with wllarm water, and tying it up with a bandage. This promotes healthiy granulation, and the hollow gradually fills up. Internally give Lac/hesis, leplar, and Silicea, alternately, every second day a dose (four glob.), until four doses of each are given, or improvement is perceptible. Second. An ulcer mav in this case dress it with finely-powdered loaf su(gar, or with a bandage dipped in cold water and cllanged from time to time. Internally, Petroleum, Lycoporizlt, and Silicea, in the same manner as above. Third. An ulcer may be fistulous: in this case try to compress, if possible, the farthest ends of the fistula, or fill them with dry lint to excite healthy granulation, always trying to heal up the (leepest cavity first. Give Antimon. crud., Calcarea carb., Siliceca, and Sulphur, in the same manner as above. Fourth. An ulcer may be callous, with thick, hard, broken mnargins. In this case fill tile bottom with dry lint, and dress around the margins witlh simple cerate. Give Arsenic, Pzlsat., Lycolpod., and Sulphur, in the same manner as above. Fifth. An ulcer may be carious, proceeding from the bone; dress outside with simple cerate, and give Mjercury, Sulphur, Caclcarea cacrb., and Lycopodium in the same manner as above. Sixth. An ulcer may be varicose, caused by swelling of thle veins, for instance, on the lowver limbs; dress outside Nwith simple cerate and give Pualsatilla, Lycopodium, Lachesis, and Sul~phur in the same manner as above. \\We have another condition of the ulcer to take into considleration, in order to determine what medicine has to be given. First. Ulcers may be painful; in this case give: a. WVhen accompanied by a burning or drawing sensation, lIrsenic, Rhus, and Sulphur in the same manner as above. b6. When beating, eacting, or pressing, Afercury, Lachesis, Lycopioditum and S'ulphur in the manner. itching, rIepar sulph., Pulsatilla, and Sulphur in thle same may be give Carbo ~l;tric acid. Lachesis, and WA''ER.-See Tetter.\" Tamors. Swellinzg -of ol disclharg'es tl1rough an opening of the sore, eithler prepared naturally, or artiiiacilly by a lancet. TlEAaATEs.T.-Betfore an abscess opens, it may be very pailnfil; in tlhis case, poultice it with bread and milk, and take internally,.Belladonna, Lachesis, and Jfelrcury, alternately, every three or four hours a close (four glob.), until better. If it is a long time'uliat'ig, Wlithout being very painful (cold steelling), take le2p.)ar slph., Iodine, and Su.llp)lur, every other evening' a dose, alternately, and poultice it when it comes near breaking. Aftier an abscess has opened, wash it frequently during the daly with a solution of twelve globules of Silicea in half a teacupf'al of water, and take internallly Siliec.a, every other cvelnino; a. dose (four glob.), until three doses are taken. It it be desired to open an abscess with a lancet, select the I-, west part, if it be also the softest, which latter place is always to be chosen first. In other swellings, particularly when they appear hard, witlh stitches throughll them, or soft, without much pain, apply nothing externally, until after having' consulted a hoimceopathic physician. Meanwhile, take internally Calcarea carb., every three or four days a dose in the evelniln1g (four glob.), until six doses are talen; afterward, Saiph-ttr ia the same manner. 12 [Page 138](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/140) 138 CUTANEOUS DISEASES. Enlarqecl and indurated glacnds on the neck, etc., require Riz.s t. and Dulcamara, every evening, alternately a dose (four glob.); when suppurating, Hepar sulph. and Silicea, every third evening a dose (four glob.), alternately, until four doses of each are taken. Boils. alignant Boils. Carbuncles. These are painful, hard tumors, of a pyramidal form, and deep red color, generated sometimes by a constitutional tendency, very often, however, as critical discharges after acute or eruptive fevers, or terminating chronic eruptions, such as itch, etc. They suppurate slowly, and discharge, on breaking, a little pus mixed with blood, exhibiting a core whicl is gradually discharged. TREATMENT.-The best applications externally are poultices made of bread and milk or flax-seed; all other things, such as roasted onions, soap and sugar, are too irritating, and enlarge the suppurative sphere. Internally take first Arnica evening and morning a dose (six glob.), and if the boil gets very painful and red, take Belladonna and 2Mlercury, alternately, every three or four hours a dose (four glob.). If matter has formed, take Hepar suljph. every four hours a dose (four glob.), until the tumor breaks. The predisposition to boils may be removed by taking Sulphur, every week one dose (six glob.), for six weeks. If a boil becomes blue, and increases very fast (maliynant boil), take Lcachesis every three or four hours a dose (four glob.) in alternation with Arsenic. Let the treatment be the same if typhoid fever ensues, and the patient is very weak, restless, and sleepless ( Carbuncle, Anthrcax), and mortification threatens. A boil is called a carbuncle, when it is hard, of a livid hue, and after its breaking does not present a central core, but numerous openings, through which offensive matter and blood is discharged. Carbuncle or Anthrax is always a dangerous disease particularly when seated on the head. If it [Page 139](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/141) SCIRIIUS- CAN CER. 139 is on the back, wash with a solution of Silicea, if on the chin, with a solution of aVitlric acid alternately with Cacbo veg.: particularly if salivation attends the disease. If the pain in the ulcer is burning, wash with a solution of Arsenic, and give internally Arsenic and Carbo veg., if stinging, give Apis mzellif Scirrhhus. Cancer. We mention these diseases here, not to give their treatment, because the seriousness of their character would not allow of their being treated domestically; but it is necessary to warn patients of this kindl against all those who pretend to cure them with the knife or cauterizing applications. They always end fatally under such treatment, and witll increased misery. At the same time, we would advise them not to despair, but to apply immediately to a skillful homceopathic physician, who possesses the only means which can rationally afford relief, and which sometimes effect a complete cure. Indurations under the skin, in glands, on the lips, nose, etc., with stitching pains through them, should receive attention, fiom tlhe fear that they might be of the scirrizus nature; if so, and if not attended to in time, they will become open cancers. In such cases, relief is possible, but only by the timely advice of a skillful physician. Meantime, take -Belladonna, every third evening a dose (four glob.), until four doses are taken. In open cancers, the distressing burning pains are relieved by Alrsenic, in solutioni(twelve glob. in half a teacupful of -water), every two or three hours a teaspoonful, until four or fix are taken. [Page 140](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/142) CHIAPTEIR FEVERS. TEIE term feer is frequently misunderstood; people inlending to express by it the disease itself, while, in reality, fever is tIe reaction o/f the vital powers acgainst a disease; and, as every action in nature can be of a threefold kind, either tnot powerful enough for its purpose, or just powerful enough, ol, lastly, too powerful, the fever, also, as an action of nature, allows these three divisions. Accordingly, we have simple irritative fever7s, where the effort of nature to remove the disease is just sufficient; or, ilnfjammiatorl'y frvers, where this efifort is greater th7an is necessary; or, lastly, toIpid fevers, where the effort is not sufficient to accomplish the removal of the disease. In all forms of acute di.sease, fever of one of the above kinds is present to a greater or less extent. It is obvious that one form of fever may, under circumstances favorable to the change, merge into another; for instance, a simple irritative fever may become an inflammatory one, if the patient is over stimulated; or a torpid one, if his vital energy is too much depressed. How dangerous, therefore, must be the use of allopathic remedies in fevers, as, when a little too strong or too weak, they lead to such awful consequences! But, in Homceopathy, this result is altogether obviated, as the remedial agent used, neutralizes, by its specific action, the disease of which the fever was only an attendant symptom. (140) [Page 141](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/143) F-EVERS. 11 1h us u e see, in pneumonia, under allopatlhic treatment, that the fever frequently returns with great violence, althougob thle patient, shortly before, had been depleted to exhaustion. lie reason is, that the cause of the fever, the pneumonia, I iad notu- been removed by the depletion; the reactive force or vital ener(gy to overcome the disease was merely diminished, I and. therefore, the system rouses itself up again to a second attempt; if checked or depressed again, it must finally sink to rise no more; it must fall into the toipid or typhoid form. XNot so, under tlie homeeopathic treatment, where the disease itself is speciflically reached and as it were absorbed; for when the disease is removed, no effort of nature is necessary, and, consequently, the fever disappears of itself.* The action of the unaided vital force of nature, during the fever, is in two directions \u2014by the nervous, and by the vascular system-to brin7 about a crisis, sufficient for the externmination of the disease; but if it fails in establishing a sufficient crisis, nature has to surrender, and death ensues, eitlher by paralysis of the nervous system (paralysis properly so called), ori paralysis of the vascular system (mortification ). The less the disease, therefore, the less needs be the crisis; and we aid nature, indeed, if we take away the disease,-but not if we take -away her vital power to overcome it. Herein lies another important difference between the two medical sys. tems; and it is easy to see how salutary the homwopatllic, and bhow destructive the allopathic treatment of fevers must be. | The best illustration of the modus operandi of the honiceopathic mt edicines, or what is meant by specific action generally, is foiund inl the effect of the dynalmic agents of nature on each other. Positive and negative electricity, being similal, but not identical in their nature, neutralize or absorb each other; while positive and positive, being identical, repel each otherl, having no affinity to each other. ITn the same nmnner, two similar: diseases absorb each othler to tle zero point, this state is where neit.her exists, and, thlerefore, hlealth. [Page 142](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/144) 14-2 FEVERS. In most cases, oniceopaihy takes away the disease so entirely, by its specific method, that no crisis at all appelns. If it, however, takes place, it manifests itself by diarrlhea, perspiration, or otlher secretions, or by an eruption; after which, the skin becomes moist and the pulse regular. DIAGNOSIS.-Tle symptoms by which the presence of the three forms of fever may be known, are given in the following characteristics: First. Irritcaive form.-Shivering, precedin g a moderate heat; skin natural or a little moist; pulse not very much accelerated, but fuller, stronger, and not hard; urine a little more reddish than common, and with a sediment after the fever leaves. Second. ftammcatory form.-Great lassitude precedes a short but severe chill (which fiequently does not appear, however), followed by an intense heat; skin dry and burning; eyes sparkling; tongue dry; thirst intense; pulse quicker, hard, and full; urine red and scanty. Third. Torpid form. - The greatest lassitude prevails during its presence; the patient feels very weak, although he may be very hot at times; at others, the temperature is very much diminished; the skin is now very dry and inclined to crack; then, again, covered with clammy perspiration. At one time, the tongue is dry and black; at another, either natural or covered with a tough mucus. Thlere is often an absence of thirst, although the tongue is dry; and then, again, thirst is intense, with a moist tongue. The pulse shows the same anomaly, being sometimes fufll, with a low temperature of the body; and again, at other times, small and weak, with a high fever-hleat of the system. TREATMENT. -A's we have only given here the general character of the three kinds of fever that combine themnselves with local diseases of the different organs, we must, also, generalize their treatmen there, and refer, for details, to the affections of the respective organs where fever manifests [Page 143](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/145) COMMON OR EPHEMERAL FEVER. 143 itself. For instance; fever of the lungs, pneumonia, inflammatory, or torpid (typhoid), see \"Affections of the Lungs.\" The essentials in the treatment of all fevers are as follows: Quiet and rest of body and mind, as much as possible; cool and even temperature of the patient's room, say from fifty to sixty degrees, according to comfort; pure air and thorough ventilation, without producing it by draughts passing on or over the patient. Let the patient lie on mattresses, and be covered with quilts, light, but sufficiently warm. As the patient himself does not desire solid food, we ought not to give it; but, when thirsty, we must never refuse drink. The best dlink is cold water, as much as the patient desires, if it agrees with him; frequently give toast water, barley or rice water, or lemonade, except when the patient has a diarrhea, or is taking Aconite, with which no acid will agree. In convalescence, baked apples and stewed prunes are very salutary, if there is no diarrhea at the time; the latter, however, should be partaken of sparingly. We will now treat of several other general forms of fever as they occur. COMMON OR EPHEMERAL FEVER. (Febris Simp2lex.) DIAGNOSIS. - Shivering, followed by heat, restlessness, thirst, quick pulse; its termination is generally within twentyfour or thirty-six hours, by profuse perspiration. It is mostly caused by exposure to sudden changes of temperature, and will then terminate in from twenty-four to fortyeight hlours; but where it is the forerunner of other more serious diseases, such as scarlet fever, measles, etc., it will be superseded by them. TREATMIENT.-Aconite, in solution (twelve glob. to half a teacupful of water), every two hours a teaspoonful, until pcispittrioin ensues. DIET AND RE-IMEN.-Cover the patient well, and let hinm [Page 144](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/146) 144 FEVERS. drink cold water, lwhich promotes perspiration. Bathing thle feet in wclrim water before lying down is allowed, but it should be done near the bed. N. B. If pains are felt in different parts of the body, see rIespective headings, and treat accordingly. GENERAL INFLAMMATORY FEVER. (Synocha.) DIAGmNOSIS.-See \" Fevers-Inflammatory form.\" CAUSES.-This form of fever is frequently caused by sudden checks of perspiration and exposure to ligh degrees of temiperature or its sudden change. It also originates by external injuries or lesions. Plethoric and young persons are im ost liable to it. It frequently runs into typhus fever, particularly when treated allopathically. TREATMENT. \u2014-Aconite must be given first, the same as in common fever. See preceding article. But, if, after six hours, there is no improvement, give Belladonna,; especially iwhlen the head is hot with violent pains in tlhe Jront p2art; red face, sensitiveness to light; delirinm. ADMINISTRATION.-the same as.Aconite above, or alternating wvith it, until better. But, if, witil the general symptoms of inflammatory fever, there is swinmming in the head on rising or moving; some deliI the the back; oppression of the lungs; give Bryonia; 1and, if the weather is damp and rainy at the time, give Ilhus, in aiternation with B-ryonia, in the same manner as above in Alconile and B'elladonna, until better. APPLICATION OF WATER, n the form of the wet sheet, and a covering of bla-nkets, beside drinking of cold wa1t(er, is recommended as a-n to the homonopathic imedication. [Page 145](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/147) N-ERVOUS OR Ti'YPHOID FEVER. 145 DIET AND REGIMEN -th1e same as under the head of \"Common Fever.\" NERVOUS OR TYPHOID FEVER. (T7YypIUs. ) These names signify the same disease, the various grades of which are distinguished by prefixing the appropriate word in an adjective form, as a malignant typhoid fever; a malignant, typhus, or, a maligncant nervous fever; all three of which signify the samlle. Although we could not advise any one to treat a fever like this on his own responsibility, with no other guide than a work on domestic practice, unless in cases of absolute necessity, it is, nevertheless, advisable to give a sufficient account of the disease and its remedies, to enable the inquirer to distinouaiSh it from otlhers, and commence its treatment with the ri(ghit remedies. The progress of the disease may frequently be arrested by early and proper treatment in its commencement. To the realization of this important point our particular attention will be directed, as in the prevention of disease is seen the great advantage of dolnestic practice. )IAGoNOsIS.-The real nature of typhus consists in an alteration of the blood, which becomes thick, decomposed, and carbonized; but as such a qualitative change of the blood cannot take place at once, the disease begins slowly, but is sur11e i in its progress, unless arrested by the properl homopathic remedy. The first indrications are, general lassitude, chil!iness, fiol lowed by occasional feverishness, and, sometimes, pain in the head, chest, or abdomen, followed by drowsiness. Then appear the symptoms given under the heading \"FeversTorpid form.\" Beside these, one characteristic symptom of real typhus is, a pain in the abdomen near tlhe right hip, sensible to heavy pressure; here, in the intestines, ulcerations. 1 [Page 146](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/148) 1406 FEVEin. - of the glands inivariably trake place in real typhus; hence the pain only on pressing heavily. Under such symptoms, it runs its course, if not checked by good homceopathic treatment, perhaps to convalescence, by frequent critical efforts, in about twenty-eight days. The best crisis is perspiration which comes on gradually; or, sleep, in the place of delirium and restlessness. Bleeding- of the nose is less favorable; and a still less favorable crisis is the swelling of the glands in front of, and below the ear; or, it ends in death, either by paralysis, or mortification. (See \" Fevers.\") CAUSES. - In general, any depressing influence on the vital powers of the body may produce typhus, but, particularly, over-exertion of the body or mind; excesses of any kind; long and imprudent exposure to cold or damp weather; bad air, water, and mode of living; crowded population in filthy streets and small apartments; exhausting blood-letting in inflammatory diseases; or, lastly, a real typhus contagion, which is generated in one form of the disease. (See below, Contragious Typhus.\") PREVEN'rIVES. - The best preventive is, to avoid the above described causes of the disease, and to take, if already threatened with it, Bryonia and Rhus, every evening alternately a dose (four glob.), for eight days, or until better. Keep quiet and in the house; follow the diet prescribed in fevers generally; keep the feet warm and head cool; drink fieely of cold water, and take no allopathic remedies, such as pills, etc., qPoni any consideration. DIFFERENT FORMS OF Tp;-Inus. First. According to the time of its cappeaerance, typhus is: a. Primary idiCpathic, or true and contagyiozs typhus; or, b. Secondary, following another disease, and pseudo-typhus; that is, fevers with apparently typhoid symptoms. [Page 147](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/149) DIFFERENT FORMS OF TYPHUS. 147 Second. According to its locality, typhus is. a,. Typhus of the brain (typ~hus cerebralis), typihoid brainfever, and congcestive fever; lungs (typhus pulmonalis), typhoid lung fever; c. Typhus of the bowels (typhus abdominalis ), abdominal typhoicl, and yellow fever. N. B. In either of these three forms, those characteristic symptoms of real typhus (pains, on pressure near the right hip, in the intestines), as mentioned above (see \" Diagnosis\"), never fail to appear, even if the brain or lungs are primarily affected. Third. According to its qualitative appearance, typhus is: a. Versatile (typlh/us versatilis), with excited nervous action; b. Stupid (typhus stupidus), with depressed nervous action; c. Putrid (typhus putridus), with tendency to organic dissolution. For practical purposes we follow the distinctions made under the \" third \" or last division, as it is only the qualitative differences in typhus that make different remedies necessary. The stupid form is oftener found in the typhus of the brain; the versatile, in typhus of the lungs; and the putrid, in typhus of the bowels. Yet there are exceptions. TREATMENT. \u2014At the commencement of all three forms, if there is headache, giddiness, chilliness with alternate heat, rheumatic pains in the limbs and arms, sometimes a slight cough with pains in the back, with or without diarrhea, sickness at the stomach or vomiting, restlessness at night, furred tongue; give Bryonia and Rlhus, every two hours a dose (four glob.), until three of each are taken. Make the patient lie down, well covered, and await the reaction for twenty-four hours; giving nothing, during that time, except one or two doses of CofeaCc and Bellad.cc, if he is very restless during the night. As soon as the patient perspires and the symptoms gradually disappear, the typhus, as such, is checked, [Page 148](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/150) 14-8 FEVERS. and its return is prevented by givintg, on the third day, evening and morning, a dose (four gblob.) of Sulphzur; during which time the patient still keeps his room, and diets as recommended in fevers. If, however, the disease progresses, and the real typhus symptoms appeal more and more, give as follows: If inflammatory symptoms appear, such as full, hard pulse; hot, dry skin; violent thirst; give Aconite, two or three doses, every two hours one (four glob.); and alternate with Belladonna, in the same manner, if to the above symptoms are added violent congestion of the head or lungs, with severe headache; sensitiveness to light and noise; starting after closing the eyes, and wild expression of countenance. Wait eight or twelve hours for the effect. If no change for the better takes place, but, on the contrary, the symptoms increase in violence, give Bryonia and Rhus again, alternately; but now only every four hours a teaspoonful of their respective solutions (twelve globules in half a teacupful of water), with which continue until four of each are taken, or until better. After this time, the disease may have changed, so as to make one of the following remedies necessary. Phosp2hor. acid. Great exhaustion, flighty when awake, always lying on the back in a drowsy state; giving either no reply to a question, or replying incoherently, loquacious, delirium, or low muttering, picking the bedclothes, black lips, drcy, hot skin; frequent, copious, watery diarrhea. Crocus is almost a specifie in typhus with diarrhea; twelve globules ill half a teacupful of water, every hour a teaspoonful, for at least three days. Arsepnic. If, with these symptoms, there is extreme prostration, of sl'te'eiytg, falling' of the lower jaw, open mouth, dull and glassy T eyes, burning thirst, profuse diarrhea, pulse barely pereeptible;,alternate CarBo vey. with Arsenzic, if to the above cdALlded rattling respiration, cold perspiration on [Page 149](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/151) DIFFERENT FORMS OF TYPHUS. 149 the face and extremities, and very offensive evacuations, to be given in solution as above, every half hour a teaspoonful. These remedies suit principally in the putrid form of the disease. In the stupid form, however, after Bryonia and Rhus have been given, the following remedies may be found necessary. Opium. When there is great drowsiness, with snoring breathing, open mouth, low mutterings, picking the bedclothes, lethargy, all discharges passing involuntarily, give every hour a dose (four glob.), until better, if not, give Phosphor. acid as above. Lachesis. Under the same symptoms as those under Opium, particularly if the tongue is very red and shining, as if varnished; in the same manner as above. Lycol)odium. Under similar symptoms as Lachesis, and then in alternation with it, in solution, every two hours a teaspoonful, until a change takes place; but particularly if there is a strongly marked redness of the cheehs, constipation, and screaming, especially on awakening, dryness of the tongue without thirst. These are specific where constipation is present. In the versatile form, after Bryonia and Rhus have been given, the following medicines may be necessary, as, Hyoscyamus. When there is a desire to escape; twitchings, and grasping at persons that are near; hot, red face, with bluish cheeks, sparkling eyes, dry, brownish tongue; alternately bland and furious delirium, involuntary evacuations; give every three hours a dose (four glob.), alternating with Belladonna in the same manner; or, in alternation with Stramonium. If to these symptoms are added frightful fancies, loquacious delirium, staring eyes, spasmodic action, convulsions, and aversion to liquids; no stool or urine, and loss of consciousness. There are several other remedies, which, under various circumstances, are important in the treatment of this disease. Arnica, their pathogenetic symptoms, andl give them if similar with the state of the patient. N. B. If at any time the patient is very sleepless, give Coffea\"' and BelladonnacC, every hour a dose (four glob.), alternately. If there is clammy, cold skin, debilitating and clammy sweats, diarrhea or disposition to it, give Camphor and alternate with Coffea, if very restless, every half hour a dose until better. During convalescence, China, Mercury, and Sulphur are frequently necessary. (See \" Materia Medica,\" at the end of the book. APPLICATION OF WATER. \u2014 In no disease, perhaps, is the wet sheet, as an auxiliary remedy, of more use than in the different forms of typhus, particularly where the skin is dry and hot. In this state, even frequent ablutions will relieve the patient vely much; the drinking of cold water must be allowed, except during a chill or when the patient lays in a heavy perspiration. DIET AND REGIMEN the same as under \" Fevers.\" Congestive fever is a typhoid brain fever, and is treated as already stated, with Aconite, Belladonna, Bryonia, Rhus, Opium, etc. The contagious typhus is in nothing different from the above, only it is caused by contagion. The attack occurs but once in a person's lifetime and its course is marked with great severi ty. The pseudo-typhus or bilious-rheumatic fever is composed of the incipient symptoms of typhus, and has to be treated accordingly, as stated above, with Bryonia and Rhus, followed by Sulphur, to prevent its running into real typhus. For the treatment of this form, however, compare Ipecac., Pulsatilla, Ignatia, and 1Vux vore., in the \"Materia Medica\" at the end of the book. The ship fever is a species of the contagious and abdominal typhus; treat accordingly; compare as in \"Yellow Fever.' [Page FEVEIR. 151 YELLOW F}EVER. As I never hlad an opportunity to observe and treat this malilgnant fever, I thougl'ht it advisable to insert here the full article of Doctor Marcy on that subject, who had an opportunity to peruse tile notes left by Doctor Taft, whose success in thle treahtm.ent of yellow fever was astonishing: This fever is exceedinglly uncertain in its course, violence, and duration. It may strike its victim suddenly prostrate, overwhelrmin(g, in its severity, the whole system, and thus preventing a single rally of the circulatory vessels; or it may advance mildly, differing but little from an ordinary attack of remittingo fever. In some instances it bears a strong resemblance to the higher grades of bilious fever. Much depends upon the peculiar circumstances of the individual attacked. If he is recently from a temperate climate, and unaccustomed to hot regions, he will be more susceptible to the action of the poison, than if he had been previously acclimated. Medical men have supposed that after a certain period of exposure, the system becomes so completely accustomed to the miasm, that it loses all susceptibility to its influence, and in this manner the process of acclimation is accomplished. There is, doubtless, some truth in this idea, but there are other causes which exercise quite as important an influence in this process. Those persons who abandon a temperate, for a residence in a tropical climate, do so in that physical condition which the requirements, habits, and regimen of the former naturally generate. In a previous chapter we havr seen that, in cold reg'ions, where the atmosphere is highly condensed, a large amount of animal food is requisite to supply the system with sufficient carbon and liydrogen to resist and neutralize the action of the inspired oxygen. With these habits, appropriate only where a condensed atmosphere is respired, individuals seek the tropics, with bodies abounding in carbon, and continuing, in most instances, their accustomed regimen of animal food and stimulants, thus buLrdening their [Page 152](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/154) 1 2 F5, VaI;s. systems with an amount of the elements of nutrition fai |greater than the oxygen conttainedl in thle rarefied air which they inhale can decompose. It is probable, thllerefore, that one of the chief predilsposing causes of yellow fever, is the presence of a greater amount of carbon in the system than the inspired air can properly act upon. Thle exact equilibrium between thle supply'of the elements of the food and the absorbed oxygen is disturbed; the carbon predominates, and all of those delrangements which proceed from a superabundance of thlis agent, necessarily ensue. The inhabitants of tropical latitudes hasve comparatively but little desire for animal food, but prefer farinaceous diet, vegetables and fruits, in this manner naturally securing to themselves a due proportion between the ele.lments assimilated and the oxygen absorbed; while the inhabitants of the north find it necessary to consume large quantities of meat and other articles abounding in the elements of nutrition, in order to preserve a healthy equilibrium. We, therefore, most strongly urge it upon those who remove from cold to hot climates, to adapt their systems by appropriate regimen and strict temperance in all things, for the change, and we confidently predict that they will enjoy as great an immiunity fiom this dreadful scourge as the natives themselves. DIAGNOSrs. \u2014The premonitory symptoms of yellow fever are giddiness, wandering pains in the back and limbs, slight chills, nausea, and frequent sensations of faintness. After these symptoms have continued a few hours, a decided reaction occurs; the circulation becomes excited, the face flushed, the eyes red; there are violent pains in the head, back, loins, and extremiLies; distress of stomach, and vomiting of acid bilious matters; the surface becomes dry and burning' hot; mouthl and throat drv, with intense thirst, and tometimes delirium. The duration of paroxysnml 153](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/155) YELG;LOW FEVER'S 13 lhours, althouogh occasionally it continues two or three days, after which there is a remission of all the symptoms, except a distressed sensation in the stomach, with nausea and vomitin. Tlhe patientl remains in thlis state with a considerable degree of comfort foir a few hours, whllen there is a recurrlence of many of the former symptorms in an agg'ravated form. Tlie stomach now becomes extremely painful and sensitive; vomiting is violent and incessant; the fluids ejected are of a darlker color; the skin and eves acquire a yellow tin'e, and the mind becomes confused and wanderin. The duration of this second sta,-e varies from twelve to forty-eihllt hours, with sometimes slighlt remissions toward the termination of thle paroxysm, wlhen the third or last stage sets in. This stage is characterized by thle complete development of the dreaded \"61a/ck vonmit.\" At this period, the powers of the system all sink rapidly; the pulse flagns, and perhaps intermits; the tongue becomes dry, black, and shriveled; the breathing' irreg'ular and laborious; cramps seize the calves of thle legs and t-he bowels; the whole countenance loses its extremities become cold; colliquative sweats, diarrhlea. hemorrhagoes, and loss of intellect occur, and, finally, dissolution ends the scene. This is only a brief outline of the more ordinary symptoms and course of the malady, and will, we trust, serve to aid the inexperienced practitioner in his diagnosis. Each case, however, must necessarily present modifications according to the predisposition, habits, and peculiar circumstances of the individual attacked. CAUSES. - When animal and vegetable matters are submitted, for a considerable length of time, to the daily influence of intense solar heat, and a certain amount of moisture in the crowded and filthy streets of cities, or other confined places, a miasm is generated, which, under favorable circumstances, will cause yellow fever. Concerning' the nature of this nmiasm we know noth,.inT; but it is evident that the [Page 154](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/156) 154 GFErERS. continued hirgh degree of temperature to which these substances are exposed, and the confinement of their noxious emanations within the walls of crowded cities, develop a more virulent morbific agent than is the case when the same matters are exposed in the open country, or to a more irregular and less intense heat, such as usually occurs in more temperate localities. There are several other causes which act as powerful predisposing influences, one of the most important of which, as before mentioned, is the too free use of animal food and stimulants. We may also include in this category, irregular habits, mental anxiety, depression of spirits, fear, grief, exposure to night air or to a burning sun, and, indeed, whatever else tends to debilitate the organism. TREATMENT.-The remedies most commonly applicable in the treatment of this affection are Ipecac., Belladonna, Bryonia, Rlhus, Arsenic, and Aconite. The and Laclhesis. The late and much lamented Doctor Taft, of New Orleans, was eminently successful in his treatment of the yellow fiver as it occurred in that city. Some time since, we had the pleasure of perusing a letter from a highly intelligent gentleman of New Orleans, in which he states, that the success of Doctor Taft was so great in this malady as to attract the marked attention of a large number of citizens; and the writer expresses a deliberate opinion, that a new and favorable era would soon have occurred in the management of this formidable affection, if the able and accomplished Taft had survived. The remedies which this physician found most successful, and upon which lhe chiefly relied, were Aconite, Ipecac., Belladonna, and. Bryonia, in thefirst, and sometimes second stag.es; in the second and third stages, in addition to the above, Rhus tox., Arsenic, Verat rum, Cantharides, attenula [Page 155](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/157) YELLOW FEVER. 155 tion, and frequently repeated, either singly or in alternation, as the circumstances of each case appeared to require. When the first symptoms declare themselves, as dizziness, slight chills, pains in the back and limbs, uneasy sensations at the epigastrium, with nausea, vomiting, and sensation of faintness, Ipecac., at the third attenuation, should be immediately exhibited. This remedy may also be found serviceable during the second and third stages, in alternation with some other article. Should the malady continue to progress, the following medicines should be considered, and, in proper cases, promptly administered. Belladonna. Glowing redness and bloated appearance of the face; eyes red and sparkling, or fixed, glistening, and prominent; tongue loaded with whitish mucus, or yellowish, or brownish; pulse variable.

During the remission, melancholy; dejection; when reaction comes on, great agitation, with continual tossing and anguish. ADMINISTRATION.-Belladonna is for the most part applicable to the first stage of yellow fever. Twelve globules in half a teacupful of water, every hour or two hours a teaspoonful, until better or another remedy is needed. B'?yonia. Skin yellow; eyes red, or dull and glassy, or sparkling and filled with tears; tongue dry, and loaded with a white or yellow coating; pulse rapid and full, or weak and rapid.

In less dangerous cases, the intervals of administration may be lengthened as circumstances require. Aconite. Suitable in the first anld second stages, whnen [Page 157](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/159) YELLOW FEVER. 157 there are burning and dry skin; red cheeks; full and rapid pulse; red and sensitive eyes; tongue natural or covered with a whitish slimy coat; lips and mouth dry; vomiting of mucus and bile; urine dark-red.

It may be employed in water, dissolved, every half hour a teaspoonful, until a decided impression is produced. Carho veg. and Laclhesis have both proved curative in the third stage of yellow fever, and should always receive due attention in grave cases, as also ArgeltLum nitrlicunm. APPLICATION OF WATER.-See DIAGNOSIS.-A more or less severe chill is followed by feverish heat, with dry skin, and rapid but soft pulse; the latter is fiequently intermittent, mostly irregular. The patient has a feeling of oppression and swelling at the pit of the stomach; pressure on the stomach causes not much pain, but rather a disagreeable sensation by the gases in the stomach, which are belched up, smelling disagreeably, sometimes with vomiting of a tough, variously-colored mucus, with a bitter, putrid, or slimy taste. The patient has a foul tongue, with a yellowish or brownish coat; lie complains of headache, particularly a pressing sensation over the eyes, of dizziness and unusual lassitude. In the beginning of the disease, the bowels are constipated; in its prlolress, offensive discharges appear, of badly-digested food with mucus. The urine, generally, is turbid, resembling a mixture of butter with water (urina jjumenlosa). [Page 160](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/162) h1t)0 IEVERS. There appear, sometimes, two varieties of, this fever. First variety, respecting the stom'ach, which sometimes is in. flamed in several spots, exhibiting many symptoms of a real gasti tis; such as vomiting after the least eating or drinking, continual eructation of gas and hiccough, beside great tenderness on pressing the region of the stomach. Second variety, respecting the febrile excitement, which sometimes assumes the febrile type, particularly in persons of a plethoric constitution. In such cases the pulse becomes hard and full, with rush of-blood to the head, the skin dry and hot, the tongue has a thin, whitish coat, the urine, at first dark brown, becomes turbid only on standing. The remission of these symptoms takes place in the morning, therefore, the name remittent fever; a complication with the intermittent is frequently observed, particularly in marshy regions. CAusEs.-This fever mostly appears in the summer, when the atmosphere is moist or changeable; also, during longcontinued hot weather. Persons of weak digestion, with irritable temperament, are predisposed to it; also, those of sedentary habits, and indulging in debauchery or eating to excess indigestible food. As exciting causes, we mention: overloading of the stomach, anger, fear, taking cold and exposures to inclement climates. Duration and course are very indefinite; this disease may terminate in a few days or it may last for weeks. Under a judicious homceopathic treatment, its duration is very much shortened, as, by the specific action of the medicines on the disease, its termination does not depend on the appearance of a favorable crisis, whereby a great deal of time is saved. If, however, a crisis appears, it does not impede the homceopathic medication: if it is too excessive or debilitating, the proper remedies have to be applied. Such crises appear by vomiting of food or bile, and by diarrheas of bile, mucus and indigestible substances. It is very favorable during, the course [Page 161](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/163) B3ILIOUS REMITTENT FEVER. 161 of the disease, if the skin becomes moist, the urine deposits a sedimient, or fever blisters appear on the lips and nose. This disease can change into the intermittent fever or typhus, if neglected or badly treated. In such cases we refer the reader to the chapters of these diseases. TRIEATMENT. \u2014As the premonitory symptoms of a bilious remittent fever indicate, generally, a derangement of the stomach, from errors in the diet, or exposures to the changes of the weather, it is necessary, above all, to counteract these efl;-ctually in the beginning. In this stage of the disease, commonly termed biliousness, there is no fever yet, which will soon appear, however, if the patient does not adhere to a strict diet and keep quiet. His diet must be of the lightest kind, gruels, light bread, black tea and cold water; complete rest on the bed or couch. In case of the stomach having been overloaded, take coffee without milk or sugar; if caused by the eating of fat meat, etc., take Pulsatilla, C'hina, Carbo veyetabilis; and, if there still remains nausea and gagging, give Antlimonium crudugm (see \"Indigestion\"). If anger was the cause, give Chamomile, and, if accompanied by chilliness and headache, in alternation with Bryonia (see \"Affections of the Mind\"). If climatic influences, exposures to cold or damp weather caused the biliousness, give Bryonia and Rhus, particularly if pains in the head, arms, and limbs are present; ~atdminister as stated page 119; beside, consult the article on indigestion. The principal remedies for the bilious If the symptoms of the first variety predominate, consult the article on gastritis, if those of the second, see \" Congestion of the Head,\" and \"Inzflammatory Fever.\" SYMPTOMATIC DETAIL.-Aconite.

APPLICATIION OF WATER-See \"Fevers;\" beside, if constipation shall be removed, the effect of the proper homneopathic [Page 164](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/166) 164 I FEVERS. remedy can be supported by cold injections and drinking of cold water. coI)Ed AtND REcGIME-A. \u2014As in fevers generally, lemonade is very Crateful to patients of this kindl, mnust however be avoided, where there is severe diarrhea. INTERMITTENT FEVER. FEVER AND AGUE. CHILLS AND FEVER. (Febris intermittens.) The difference between remittent and intermittent fevers is very marked, and ought to be well understood. Remittent is a fever in which the symptoms continue during the whole time of the patient's sickness, only varying, from time to time, in severity; but never leaving the patient entirely at any time. Bntermittent, however, is a fever, in which the symptoms, at certain times, cease, and the patient feels as if entirely free from them, or well. To this latter class belong the chills and fever, or fever and ague, which is caused either by a certain miasma, generated in marshy countries, or follows other diseases, acute as well as chronic; for instance, inflammation of the liver, indigestion, internal obstructions, etc. DIANOSIS. -- The cold stage is preceded by languor, yawning, drowsy headache, numbness of toes and fingers, and blue nails. Then coldness of the extremities is felt, gradually increasing, until the patient sometimes begins to shake and tremble, his teeth to chatter, and delirium ensues. During this time, the pulse is weak and oppressed; his thirst variable; the cold stage lasts from twenty minutes to three or four hours, and varies much in severity. The hot stage shows all the symptoms characteristic of an inflammatory attack: hot, dry skin; thirst; full, quick pulse; congestion of the head, and sometimes, even delirium. Its intensity and duration are variable, the latter being fIom two to six or eight hours. [Page 165](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/167) INTERMITTENT FEVER, ETC. 165 The sweating stage indicates an abatement of the fever, although, frequently, there are fever and perspiration at the same time. TrEATrMENT. \u2014Certain and general rules for the treatment of this disease cannot be given; it depends too much upon the individual, and exciting causes, to make up its general character. But we will try to be as practicable on the subject as possible. Two or three attacks must have passed before we can know, for a certainty, that we have to do with an intermittent. These attacks will have been treated already, according to their appearance, either as bilious rheumatic, or gastric fevers, whereby we may have used remedies beneficial in fever and ague also. But if this shows itself clearly as such, adopt the following treatment: First, Ipecac., four doses (six glob. each), given in regular intervals between two attacks of fever, during which no medicine should be given; but, after it is over, give one dose of T1ux vomica (six glob.). If, then, the next attack is lighter, do not give any more medicine, as the disease will disappear, the attacks gradually growing lighter and lighter. But if this general treatment does not succeed, select the specific remedy among the following, taking great care to find the one most similar to the symptoms of the disease. For its application, I will here give general directions suitable for every case. ADMINISTRATION. \u2014Having found the remedy, give three doses of it (six glob. each), commencing twelve hours before the next attack is expected, once in four hours a dose. During the attack, if the chilliness and fever are very severe, give, invariably, Aconite, in solution (eight globulies in half a teacupful of water), every half hour or hour a teaspoonful, until the attack is over. If the next attack is lighter, give no more medicine; if not lighter, select for the next attack another more suitable remedy.

The symptoms may be examined in the Maateria Medica, at the end of the book, and then the choice made accordingly. For marsh-intermittent fevers: at first Cedron; then China, Arscnnic, Ipecac, Pulsatilka, first Oedron; afterward Lachesis, Carbo. veg., or Arsenic. Having tried to cure the intermittent fever with these remedies for a fortnight, without success, and being unable to procure a homceopathic physician, give the patient the following remedy: Take four or six grains of Quinine, mix with eighteen or twenty grains of loaf sugar, and triturate thoroughly, in a clean mortar, for half an hour; make six powders of it, and give, twelve or eighteen hours previous to the next attack, one powder; and, afterward, every two hours one, until all are given. Give, then, a similarly prepared powder one hour before the next chill is expected to come on, for at least a week, and, afterward, continue to give such a powder every seventh day, in the evening, for thirteen weeks after the last chill. If the fever returns (which it seldom does), use Pul-. satilla, Arsenic, and. Natrum mur. 15 [Page 170](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/172) 170 FEVERS. N. B. If the disease is complicated with biliousuess, see this article in Index. APPLICATION OF WATER in the cure of this disease is frequently of the greltest advantage, and ought to be preferred by hoinoeopa;hists to any other expedient, on account of its effi acy a.:nd harmlessness. The wet sheet during the period of heat, the sittin,-bath before going to bed eveiy evening, excelpt whn in a f:ver-paroxysnm, or during perspirationl and the wet ban-lase around the abdomen, are the prin-ipal modes of application. The proper homeoepathic remeily must be given at the sanme time. It is frequently necessary to resort to the douche, particularly in obstinate cases, or where the rc.a-tive force of the system has to be aroused. In numerous cases of the most inveterate kind, I have had reco'-se to the wet sheet, and I must acknowledge, that in most all of them, but one, application was sufficient to cure the fever and prevent its return. It can only be useful, however, itu such cases, where the reactive force is still abundant and then the effect is startling. I begin to p to pack the patients just wh:n the chilly period commences, the duration of which is thereby very much shortened. fever-reaction quickly follows, and the patieuts are well contented to remain in the pack until tlhe fever and sweat is over.

ADMINISTRATION.-The selected remedy should be prepared and given as follows; Dissolve twelve globules of it in half a teacupful of water, and give, every half hour a teaspoonful, until three or four are given, or until better; if not better after three or four doses are taken, select another remedy, and give it in the same manner. As soon as the patient feels better, give the medicine at longer intervals. APPLICATION OF WATER.-That in the various affections of the mind, when depending on material changes of the system, the water can be made a useful auxiliary, is evident; yet its application is only necessary, where the disease has been of long standing. In such cases it is possible to arouse by it [Page 174](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/176) 1IL7 AFFECTIONS OF THE MIND. the sleeping reaction of the system and prepare the way properly for the readier action of homncopathic medicines.. 1-Frequent bathing and washing are the principal modes of application. HYPOCHONDRIA. HYSTERIA. These two diseases are not essentially, but sexually, different. Hypochondria is the name for it in a male person, Hysteria, in a female. Persons inclined to this disease have great disposition to spasms and nervous attacks; their idiosyncrasies and sympathies are very much developed, from which result a great variety of singular fancies and imaginary sufferings, clianginSg frequently in expression and character; sadness and excessive joy, deep distress and buoyant hilarity follow each other in rapid succession. Their real disorders can be traced generally to obstructions in the abdomen and abnormal states of the sexual organs. Debilitating influences of any kind may produce them, particularly where constitutional predisposition is present; also, suppression of habitual secretions, as piles, fluor albus, etc. The female system is more liable to them, if an ungoverned and unsatisfied imagination is fed daily by reading novels, plays and trashy romances. This disease is by itself not fatal; but becomes very troublesome to the patient as well as others. TREATMENT.-Part of the treatment must consist in encouraging the patient during the fits of distress and pain even if only imaginary; to the patient these sufferings are real, and it cannot be of benefit to him, to express doubts of their reality in his presence. A kind, patient, sympathizing attention, with occasional congratulations on his progressive recovery, etc., is more beneficial, and contributes much to gain his confidence. During the hysteric fit or spasm, it is only necessary to admit fresh air, and sprinkle cold water in the face of the patient; let him smell firom time to time on camphor, or [Page 175](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/177) tIA stricet.est homwtopatlhic rules,;a11owi!: plenrtv of exercise in the open air, it can be takecn' divern,-t in, thie minid a conzyestive and a nervous h Poclionlldi i and hysteria is very irlpor:,ant, as it greatly facilitates thle selection of the riit iremedy.

NMatrum spirits; desire to be alone; aversion to life; illhumor; disposition to vehemence; cannot perform mental labor; headache, with want of appetite; indigestion after eating. ADMINISTRATION.-Give of the selected remedy every third evening a dose (six glob.), until four or six doses are taken; then discontinue for the same length of time; giving afterward the next best remedy in the same manner; and so on, until better. APPLICATION OF WATER. - Beside the modes of applying the water indicated on page 173, this disease requires sittingbaths, foot-baths, wet bandage around the abdomen, cold injections and the wet sheet; sometimes the douche is indicated when the symptoms of this disease resemble that of the following; in melancholia tlhe douche is the principal application. MELANCHOLIA. MANIA. A disturbance of the normal actions of the mind similar to the former, but more deeply seated, with general derangement of the system always requiring skillful medical aid.'If the patient is timid, unsociable, sad, listless, weak, we call it melancholia; if he is in the opposite state, and dwelling on a fixed idea, we call it nzanEa and frenzy. The treatment of these disorders is so difficult and complicated, that it would be impossible to introduce it here with advantage. We only draw the attention of the reader to a few remedies, which may be given to commence a cure or satisfy immediate necessities, until competent help can be procured.

Bryonia. Painful pressure in the temples, or sensation as if everything would fall out of the forehead when stooping, nose bleeds without relief; constipation. If in wet weather, alternate with Rhus. Administer every two or three hours a dose (four glob.), until three doses of each are given, or until better. Rhus tox. Congestion with burning, throbbing pains, and fullness in the head; rheumatic pains in the limbs; worse after eating. (See Bryonia.) ADMINISTRATION of the above remedies, the same as in'Affections of the Mind.\" [Page 182](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/184) 1 82. AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD. APPLICATION OF WATER.-This ought to form an important part in the treatment of this disease, at least, when caused by sedentary habits, intense study, or drinking spiritous liquors. Beside the proper homoeopatbic remedies, the patient oulght to take, an hour before dinner every day, a cold sitting-battl, drink during the day from eight to twelve tumblers of cold water, and exercise a great deal in the open air; in the evening before going' to bed it is well for him to take a cold foot-bath of ten minutes' duration, during which time the feet must be rubbed and after the bath dried off. DIET AND RErGIMEN. \u2014The diet ought to be light, farinaceous; no meat or broths, except in cases where loss of blood or fluids has preceded the congestion. In the habitual form of congestion, early rising and daily exercise in the open air, bathing or sponging in cold water, are recommended. 2. VERTIGO. GIDDINESS OR DIZZINESS. It arises either from disordered stomach, irritation of the brain and congestion to the head, or from suppressed eruptions, or ulcers; also from riding in a carriage. In most cases it accompanies severe disorders of the brain and stomach, when it ought to be treated by an experienced homceopathic physician. Until such help can be had, the following remedies may be resorted to: of the above remedies, read its detailed s-mpntoms below. A conite. Vertigo on raising the head after lying down or stoopin' attendled with nausea, vomiting, dimness of sighlt, lOss ol crud. Nausea and vomitino; aversion over-eating, or during mecals, with nausea, dimness of sight, red face; is followed well by Vaux voret., Chamomile, Mhus, sLa.ckheis. in ca-ses of this kind, frequently very dangerous, seek the advice of a hoinceopathic physician. Nux vom. Vertigo during or cfter a meal, or when wusrlking in. the open air; stoopin~g or thinking; worse in the mo'rn,ij-/q or evening, in bed, when lying on the back, with sensation as if turning around or falling; fainting; loss of dimness of sight; worse when rising from bed, and obliged to lie down again. P]'ulsatilla. Vertigo when looking Tpwardl, or when sittinll or stoopin,; worse in the evening, oi after a meal; better in the open air. IJihus. Vertigo when lying down in the eveiling, with fear of falling or dying. Lachesis. Vertigo on walking in the morning, with absence of mind; intoxicated feeling; constipation; sensation as if tle head were turning to thle left side. M3ercurvy. Vertigo on arising in the nimorning, or in the evening', with nausea; dimness of sight; or when raising the hlead, with a desire to lie down again. (See Bryonia.) Br'yonia. Same as Mifercury, and with feeling of intoxica. tion and congestion when stooping and rising again. Hepar suljh.. Veritigo from riding in a carriage. Cocculus. Same as Hey,1ar sulph., if this is not sufficient. [Page 184](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/186) 184 AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD. Petroleum. Same as Cocculus, if that is not sufficient. Silicea. Same as Petroleum, if this is not sufficient, or the vertigo seems to rise from the back to the nape of the neck, and thence to the head; worse in the morning and after emotion. Sulphur. Vertigo in the morning, or at night, when ascending an eminence, or after a meal; after suppressed ulcers and eruptions. China. Vertigo, with fainting when raising the head. (See \" Congestion to the Head.\") Calcarea carb. Same as Sulphzur, and when with trenmbling before breakfast; coldness of the head; congestion to the head. Chamomile. Vertigo in the morning or after eating, and drinking coffee, with fainting turns. ADMINISTRATION. -Every two, three, or four hours, one dose (four glob.) until relieved, or another remedy is necessary. If in vertigo, caused by congestion to the head, see \"Administration\" in that article. APPLICATION OF WATER, in this disease, is similar to that recommended in congestion of blood to the head; but the sitting bath for violent vertigo must be lukewarm, while cold-water bandages are applied to the head at the same time. The proper homceopathic remedies must be administered. DIET AND REGIMEN the same as in \"Congestion to the Head.\" 3. WEAKNESS OF MEMORY. This diseased state of the brain is principally caused by debilitating loss of fuids, such as bleeding, purging, sexual excesses, etc., for which give China, iVux vom., and Sulphur, every week one or two doses (six glob. ), in alternation, until better. Sometimes it is caused by excessive mental labor, tor which give 217ux vom. and Sulphur, as by exiernal inluries, a fall or blow, give Arnica. (See \" Conogestion to the Head.\") If by Aconite, Belladonna, Chzitza, Mlfercury, ]Rhus, and Sul9hur. (See \" Congestion the Head.\") If by excessive use of Calcarea carb., Lachesis, same manner as above, under \"Debilitating Loss,\" etc. ADMINISTRATION, DIET, AND REGIMEN as in \"Congestion to'he Head.\" 4. APOPLEXY. (Apoplexia.) Short, thick-necked persons, of a full and fleshy growth, are predisposed to this disease; it is also hastened on by the too free use of spiritous liquors, by excesses of any kind, and suppression of the habitual perspiration of the feet. An attack of apoplexy is often preceded by heaviness and fullness of the head; buzzing in the ears; dim eyes; dullness of hearing; sleepiness; indistinct speech; numbness of limbs. If this state exists, particularly in old persons, or those predisposed to apoplexy, the greatest care should be taken in the diet, which ought to consist only of simple farinaceous and mucilaginous substances, and cool acidulated drinks; they ought not to exercise very much, particularly in the heat of the day, and should take the following remedies, as it is easier to prevent an attack than to cure it. Op)ium. If in old people there is unusual stupor; buzzing in the ears; obtuseness of hearing; redness of the face; consipaLtion; pulse slow and fiull. Give three times a day a dose (four glob.), until better. VNix vomiica. In people of a sedentary habit, or addicted to the use of ardent spirits, in alternation with Opium and Lachcesis, particularly when, with the above premonitory symip tomis, there is headache on the right side, with vertio and a nervous bilious temperament. ADAIlNISTRAATION same as under O2pium. 16 [Page 186](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/188) 186 AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD. Lachesis. Same as Miux vom.; but particularly when the left side of the head suffers, and lowness of spirits is connected with it. Administration same as above. Belladonnza and Aconite under the same circumstances as stated under \" Congestion to the Head.\" Arnica. When symptoms of congestion to the head appear after a neal. If an apoplectic fit ensues, however, continue the same remedies as indicated above, only give them in solution (twelve globules to half a teacupful of water), every half hour a teaspoonful until better, or another remedy is indicated. In such cases hasten immediately to procure a homceopathic physician. Avoid bleeding under any circumstances; the chances of killing the patient by such an act are too frequent. APPLICATION OF WATER is of great advantage in this disease; beside the proper homebopathic remedies, apply cold water on the parts affected; use the wet sheet, even the douche. DIET AND REGIMEN as in \" Congestion to the Head.\" 5. INFLAMMATION OF THE BRAIN. The brain and its two coverings (see Anatomical Part) are subject to inflammation separately, the characteristic symptoms of which show themselves, particularly in the beginning of a brain fever. We will, therefore, give them separately, as it is important and interesting, to be able to distinguish between the different localities of the disease. DIAGNOSIS. First species, called mzeningitis, if the dura mater, the skin next to the skull, is inflamed. The acute meningitis attacks a person suddenly, exhibiting, immediately, stupor and drowsy symptoms; the patient cannot be raisgcl easily, or keep his head erect; it inclines to fall on either side; he complains of no pain, except vertigo and dizziness; reels when walking; pupil contracted; sensitiveness TtHE BRAIN. 187 to are not red as yet; constipation; scanty, dark-red urine; fever, with a soft pulse. N. B. Old people are most liable to this species of inflammation of the brain; also those who have indulged too much in the use of spiritous liquors, particularly after taking cold. It frequently precedes an apopletic fit. Second species. Called arachnoiditis, if the covering next to the brain is inflamed. This species does not commence with stupor, and not without pain, like the first species, but with violent pains over the entire head; increased by paroxysms of congestion, with violent beating of the arteries of the neck and temples; sleeplessness; low muttering; pulse quick; if stupor ensues suddenly, the patient dies soon after. Third species. Encel2halitis vera, or inflammation of the substance of the brain, in its various parts. It commences with violent congestion and pulsation of the arteries on the neck and head; face red and bloated; eyes bloodshot and brilliant; intense heat of the head, and violent delirium. Thie patient tosses about, screams, and evinces great muscular strength and sensitiveness to light; pupil contracted; cannot hear well. The deeper the interior of the brain is affected, the more the senses are stupefied, so that, in some cases, the patient can, finally, neither see nor hear; dry skin; violent thirst; hard, full pulse; fever accordingly; frequent vomitings or retchings. TRnEATMENT.-It is easily to be conceived that, in such a violent disease, no layman would trust his own judgment, except in cases of absolute necessity; and, on this latter account, we give the following treatment of the above three species of brain fever, which is the same as regards the in.ternal remedies, and differs only in the exiernal applications, as will be seen below. EXTERNAL APPLCATIONS.-'-Firs. species \u2014cold water bandages. [Page 188](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/190) AFFECTIONS ) leeas \u2014-- ()l - selected, read the symptoms presented below. Aconite is generally given first, when there is inflammatory fever, delirium, violent burning pains through the whole br;in, particularly in the forehead; red face and eyes; hot and dry skin. Six hours after give Belladoznna or continue the use of Aconite in alternation withl Belladonna, until better. Belladonna. This remedy is almost a specific in inflammation of the brain, particularly when there is great Theat of the head, red and bloated face, violent p)ulsation oj the arteries on tile neck and temples; buryingq the eadcl in the pillow; sensitiveless to the slightest noise and light; burning and shooting pains in the head; bloodshot and brilliant eyes, with a wild expression; contracted or dilated pupils; violent and furious delirium; raving; loss of consciousness; sometimes low mutteirings, convulsions, vomiting, violent thirst. Administer alone or in alternation with Acoenite (see above), or with Stramonium anti flyoscyamus (see below). Hyoscyainus. Stupor, loss of talks about his affairs; inarticulate speech; singing, smiling, picking the bed dry; red face; desire to staling look; fri/ghtful visions; sleep natural, but with twitching, tossing about, and absence of mind when awaking; desire to escape, and screams. B-ryonia. Constant stupor, with delirium; sudden starting from sleep, screams, cold sweat on the forehead; burning and shooting pains in the head, or stitches through it. [Page 189](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/191) INFLAMMATION OF TIlE BRAIN. 189 Oiul.m. Stupor, with heavy breathinmg; eyes half open; confusion and giddiness after waking; complete listlessness and dullness of sense; also, no desire for anything, or compl aining' of anything. AnMITNISTRXATION.-Dissolve twelve globules of the selected remledy in half a teacupful of water, and give either alone or in. allfernation with anotller remedy, similarly prepared in anlt!er teacup, every hour or two hours a teaspoonful, until better o0 anothec- remedy is needed. Each remedy must have its sepalrate teaspooa, with which it is given to the patient. If signs of amnendmrent c ppear, discontinue all medicines. DIET AND RE(GIMEN as in \"' Common Fever.\" lft omica?2wtion of the bra.in- in children. As the blain of clildiren is very tender, its aieases must necessarily be more dangerous and f;requent, and xve give, therefore, in the following, a more special and some what modified treatment for inflammations of the brain in children: If a child's hbeced is very hot, feet cold, skin dry and hot, it |sleeps with, eyes half open, has scanty urine, with or without vomiting or diarrhea, let the cause of the disease be what it may, in such a case give at once Br7Jonia and Hellebor. n., in solution (twelve globules in half a teacupful of wrater, each rerledy in a separate cup), every two hours a teaspoonful, alternately, until better, or until the symptoms require a chlange of remedy, generally Sulp~hur or Mlercury. (See Materia Medica, at end of book.) If the child gets worse, or exhibits at the beginning the following sylmptomns, beside those above-mentioned: motionless eyes, with insensible pupil; loss of consciousness; moaning; icy coldness, with bluish color of the skin; pulse nearly imperceptible; respiration interrupted; give Belladonna and Zinzcumz in alternation; to be prepared and given in the same mnaner as Bron'ia and HIellebor. ni., above. The above suggestion is important, as cases of inflammation of the brain occur so often in children, when, as is said, [Page 190](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/192) 1903 (AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD. the disease goes to the head. For instance in teething; in common cold, with fever; in scarlet fever (see this article); or in other eruptions, when suppressed; also, worm fevers. If such a state should continue in a child for some time, dropsy of thIe brain (see \"Hydrocephalus\") would speedily ensue; the above treatment will surely prevent this, if applied in time. N. B. If, at any time during the treatment of inflammation of the brain, the patient is very restless and sleepless, we may give, with great advantage and without injury to the effect of the other medicines (which are discontinued during that time), CoffeaCC and Belladonna CC, alternately, every hour a dose (four glob.), until better. This may be done often in the night. 6. SUNSTROKE. Is a species of inflammation of the brain; the principal remedy is Glonoine, 2d atten., every live minutes a dose. If not better in half an hour, give Camphor, in alternation with it, at intervals of five or ten minutes, if he is sweating profusely while unconscious, and breathing heavily. Belladonna, after Camphor has been given, in alternation with Lachesis, every half hour, in solution (twelve globules of each in separate teacups half full of water), a teaspoonful at a time. Externally, wash the head and face occasionally with brandy, and give, internally, small quantities of brandy until the patient revives. Put neither cold water nor ice upon the head. 7. HEADACHE. This disease, so frequent and troublesome, requires to be treated with particular minuteness; the more so, as its treatment falls almost entirely within the legitimate sphere of domestic practice, except where headaches are the concomitant [Page 191](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/193) HEADACHE. 191 symptoms of severe fevers, as in the typhus, etc., or the forerunner of (langerous attacks, as in apoplexy, etc., in which cases the respective articles must be consulted. ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICINE IN HEADACHE. -For this purpose wve divide all headaches into habitual and. accidental. This requires two modes of -administering the medicine: one for the cure of an attack of headache, be it accidental, or one of the habitual attacks; and the other, for the eradication of the habitual headache, or the predisposition to it. First. Administration of medicine for an attack.-Having selected a remedy (from those stated below), dissolve of it six globules in three tablespoonfuls of water, and take, accordino to the severity of the headache, from half an hour to two, three, or six hours, a teaspoonful, until three are taken, when its benefits must be apparent. If beneficial, continue with the same, only at much longer intervals, as long as necessary. If not beneficial, select carefully another remedy, and prepare and take in the same manner. Secondly. Administration of medicine for eradicating the disposition to certain kinds of headache; for instance, sick headache.-Having selected a remedy, take of it, every third or sixth evening, a, dose (four glob.), until four or six doses are taken; when the next best remedy has to be taken in the same manner, or until better. APPLICATION OF WATER, in the various forms of headache, must be modified according to its different causes. If constipation shall be removed quickly, apply cold injections, if the pains are very severe, sitting-baths of short duration must be used, or cold foot-baths; these means dare not be used during menstruation. Beside, we refer the reader to the chapters, in which the prescriptions for the causes of headache are given. a. Ileadache from Congestion of Blood to the fHead. Aconite. Violent throbbing; heaviness; fullness in the forehead and temples, with a sensation as if the head would [Page 192](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/194) 192 AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD. burst; burning pain through the whole brain; red, bloated face, and red eyes; sensitiveness to light and noise; worse on moving, talking, drinking, rising up; full and quick pulse.

Hleadache from Constipation and Gastric Derangement. 1. Constijpation, which causes congestive headache, is generally cured by Bryonia, NAux vom., cr Opium, according to its concomitant symptoms (see these three remedies, under \"Headache from Congestion to the Head,\" p. 191), or by Puisatila and ZMercury. (See their symptoms under the same heading.) But, if the constipation has a chronic character, give Silicect.

In regard to the administration of the above medicines, we refer the readelr, in all cases of headache, to what is said about it in the beginning of that article, p. 191. SICK HEADACHE. This form of headache, so well known under the above name, is of a chronic nature, appearing periodically, and depending mostly upon gastric, rheumatic disorders in persons of a psoric constitution, and may be eradicated by a systematic homoeopathic treatment. Although this requires the skill of medical attendance, we will try to bring within the reach of every intelligent person sufficient knowledge for the commencement of a treatment, which, if successful, will encourage him to seek further medical advice. First, we will give the treatment of the attack itself: IPecac, and Belladonna-in almost all cases which commence with nausea, after which a bruised feeling of the whole head manifests itself, followed by vomiting or retching. ADIITNIST'RATION.-Of this and the following remedies, as directed in the beginning of the article, page 191. If not better within an hour, select one of the following remedies: l,/oscyamus. If with headache there is great sensitiveness to light, worse in the warmth of the bed, on liaing down or in a drlaught, and from noise, such as shutting the door, etc. (See \" Congestion to the Head.\") [Page 198](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/200) 198 AFFECTIONS OF TIlE HEAD. Tluzja. A boring pain over the eye; relieved by pressure; in alternation with Belladonna. Sp igelia. If there is great sensitiveness to noise, with the pains worse on the left side, and insupportable beating in the temples, the pain sometimes descending into the face and teeth, worse by stooping or motion and in the open air. T'he leadache appears generally at a regular time in the morning, growing worse with the ascending sun (sun pain). In this case, in alternation with Belladonna. Sangueinaria. If there is great sensitiveness to the walking of others in the room, with fullness of the head, as if it would burst, worse on the right side, with a feeling as if the eyes were pressed outward, chilliness, nausea, inclination to lie down. (Compare Bryonia in \"' Congestion to the Head.\") Aconite. (See this remedy in \" Congestion to the HIead.\") When the patient has a great sensitiveness to all kinds of odors, the pain mostly on the left side. In this case in alternation with Sulphur, or Jynatia. (See \" Nervous Headache.\") Aloes. If the patient complains of stitches in the left temple; the headache appears periodically, alternating with pains in the small of the back. (See \" Congestion to the Htead.\") Sepia. If there is a great dislike to be touched, and sensitiveness to thunder-storms and the cold air. (Compare with China in \" Headache from Rheumatism.\" If the patient is easily vexed, pain mostly above the right eye and worse by shaking or moving the head. Beside, consult the articles on \" Congestion to the Head,\" \"Headache from Rheumatism,\" and \" Neuralgia in the HIead.\" Second, to eradicate the disposition to sick headache, take Sepia, Silicea, and Sulphur, each remedy for six weeks, cornmencing with Sepia. During this tiue proceed as follows: take the first three weeks, every week, two doses (six glob.)

AFFECTIONS OF TIIE EYES. GENERAL REMARKS. THE diseases of the eye ought to claim our most careful attention, as this important organ is, from its position and complicated, delicate structure, subject to a great variety of diseases, which, heretofore, have been very badly treated under the allopathic system. All external applications, in the form of strong eye-waters and salves, are injurious, and even if, as in scrofulous sore eyes, for instance, these salves seem to lave effected a cure, it is only by driving the disease from the external parts to some internal organ, which is, at the time, the weakest-in most cases to the lungs. If external remedies are wanted, pure water is preferable in all cases of inflammation, applied either cold or warm, according to the feelings of the patient. In cases of external injuries to the eve, the arnica lotion (ten drops of Arnica tincture to half a teacupful of cold water) must be used externally. But, when erysipelas affects the eyes, nothing wet ought to be applied, but warm bags filled with bran. (See \"Erysipelas.\") When the inflammation of the eyes and face is caused by Lthe poison of the sumach, or other weeds, apply nothing outwardly, but give the internal remedies recommended for that disease. (See \"Poisoning by Sumach,\" page 95.) (203) [Page 204](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/206) 204 AFFECTIONS OF THE EYES. 1. INFLAMMATION OF TIIE EYELID AND ITS MARGINS. a. ki.?flamrmation and Swelling of the Eyelid. Aconite. In all cases where the inflammation and the pain is great, attended with fever and restlessness, or where the lids are swollen, hard, and red, with heat and sensation of burning and dryness, or when there is a copious secretion of mucus in the eyes and nose, with dread of light, fever, and thirst; after it Belladonna, Sulphur, or elepar sulyph., are often (See these. ) Bellalonna. If Aiconite is not sufficient; or when there is a feeling, of burning and itching in the red and swollen eyelids, which stick together, and bleed easily when opened; also, when the edges are turned to the outside, and feel as if paralyzed (see Bepar sulp). ). fiepar sulphuris. If there is a sensation of ulceration or contusion in tile red and swollen lids on touchinMg them, with sensitiveness to lilght, and spasmodic contractions of the lids in the morning.

In alternation with Xicx vom., if the eyeball is very red, and there is burning with the itching; if the patient is very irritable, and feels worse in the open air; but in alternation with Pulsatilla, if he is of a mild character, and feels better in the open air. Arsenic. Inflammation of the inside of the lids, with inability to open the eyes, and violent burning pain. Spigelia. In inflammation and ulcerations of the lids, with biting soreness, difficulty of raising the lids (as if from stiffness), with bulning in the eyes and pain in the head, worse on the least motion. Calcarea carb. Frequently after Sulph., when there are cutting, burning pains, especially when reading, with red, hard and great swelling, and copious secretion of mucus, and the lids sticking together in the morning. Hyoscyamus and Chamomile in alternation, when the eyelids are closed spasmodically, with a sensation of heaviness or pressure. ADMINISTRATICN.-Give every two, four or six hours a dose (four globules) of the selected remedy, either alone or in alternation with another, until the patient is relieved, or another remedy is necessary; discontinue the medicine altogether, as soon as the patient is improving. APPLICATION OF WATER, either cold or warm to the eyes, is strongly recommended; if constipation is present, use cold water injections, and drink cold water freely. b. Inflammation of the Margins of the Lids. The principal remedies in this disease, which frequently appears without affecting the whole lid, are Bellad., Euphrasia, 206](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/208) 206 AFFECTIONS OF THE EYES. (See the detailed symptoms of these remedies in the preceding article: \" a. Inflammation of the Eyelids.\") 2. INFL.ANaIA'rION OF THE EYEBALL. (Opidthalmia.) In most cases where the eyeballs are inflamed, the lids will also be a'ffected, and the remedies stated under \" TIntlammation of the Eyelids,\" will be beneficial. This is particularly the case, when Aconite, Bellad., and Ellphrasia are indicated, whlich are the most important remedies in diseases of the eyes, and to which we refer the reader, in the preceding article. But firequently the eyeballs alone are implicated, especially when cold, together with a scrofulous or rheumatic predispOsition, is the cause. The first remedy in this disease, particularly when it appears suddenly, is Aconite. When the eyes are very red, with dark redness of the vessels, and intolerable burning, stinging, or aching pains (worse on moving the eyes), dread of light, copious flow of tears, yet with dryness of the eyelids and fever. Belladonna. When the white of the eye is very much inflamed, sensitive to light, eitler copious flow of burning hot tears, or great dryness of the eyes, which ache all around, or deep inside, with stitches proceeding from the eyes to the head (worse on moving the eyes), and a severe cold in the head, or a violent headache, with stupor and vertigo, sparks of black spot-s betore the eyes, and a short dry cough, it suits mostly after Aconite; but fiequently, too, after Ifepar sullh., and Mfercury. Euph/rasia. Same as Bellad., and when this is insufficient; or when the pain in and above the eyes, in the head, is more pressing, and the cough not dry, but loose; also, with proiuse runnlling at the nose; worse in the evening. u.ux vomica. When the eyes are bloodshot, smarting as if from sand, with swelling and softening of the eye, irritable temper, coated tonoue, redness of the corners of the lids, with [Page 207](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/209) C'IIRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE EYES. 207 stiffness andt itclhing, actid tears, dread of liglht in the morning, headache every night, and stoppage of tile nose. OIqatia. If tile pain is more like pressure in the eyes, -lwhich are not much inflamned, but with copious flow of tears and nasal discharge, great sensitiveness to light, mild, quiet, disposiLion. ]'Plsa.tilla is often effective, after Aconite has subdued the worst inflamnimaion, andl severe pains remain (tearing, stitching, and cutting), in rheunmatic inflammation of the eyes, where thlere is sensitiveness to litght; worse in the afternoon and evenin~; thle patient is fretful and inclined to weep. Bryonia. Aftter PuIlat., when the redness still remains, the lids are swollen, with pain in the head when the eyes are opened; worse at nighlt. I/uts. After Biryonia, or in alternation with it, in damp, wet weather, or wheni the eye continues to burn and stitch, with the running, of water, or the eyelids are swollen as if from erysipelas. S7piqeliu. Aching, stitching, or boring pains, penetr[ating into the head, rand returnin'g reg'ularly at the same time of day, with a sensation as if the eyeballs were too large. The pain is at times insupportable. Szatlp/tr (See \"Inftlammation of the Eyelid\") is also necessary, after Mercury and P ulsatilla. ADMINISTRATION the same as in the foregoing article. APPLICATIoN OF WATER. (See p.'205.) J)IET AND REGIMEN, in all diseases of the eye must bt ligllt, as in fevers generallp (see these). Rest and quiet in the room are necessary.'The room itself should be dry, airy, an(l darkened. 3. C[rlONIC INFLAMLMATION OF THE EYES. Thle treatment of these inflalmmations varies according tc their causes, which are either hereditary or accquired. [Page 208](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/210) 208 AFFECTIONS OF THE EYES. a. From Gout and Rheumatism. For the severest symptoms use Aconite, Bellad., and Spigelia, as stated in the preceding article; also, Colocynt]his. When there is violent burning and cutting, extending far back into the head and nose, with great anguish and restlessness; or violent pressure in the forehead; worse when stooping, or lying on the back; severe drawing pain in the head, with vomiting. Hepar sulph. If Bellad., or Spigelia, is insufficient; or when there is redness of the eyes and eyelids, with soreness when touched; sensitiveness to light, especially in the evening; sight at times dim and obscured, at others clear; pressure in the eyeball, as if it would start out of the head. ADMINISTRATION, the same as under \" Inflammation of the Eyelids.\" APPLICATION OF WATER in this and the following diseases of the eyes, can be made either for the purpose of palliating the present condition or of eradicating them entirely. If the first is our object, we refer the reader to page 177, where these means are detailed; if we want to eradicate the disease by the use of water as a principal means, we recommend the reader to have recourse to a water-cure establishment, where a systematic use of water will be found highly beneficial in these diseases. b. From Scrofula. ( Scrofulous Sore Eyes.) Scrofula frequently affects the eyes, after an inflammation of the lids or eyeball has set in, from causes above stated, by which complication such cases are rendered much worse, and more difficult to cure; for dimness of sight and ulcers on the ball of the eye often remain; they require medical attention, as the consequences of neglect, or family treatment, would be too serious; and the necessity for the eradication of scrofula is, of itself, obvious. [Page 209](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/211) CHR, mentioned tlhere, if tley are required by the symptonis. Beside these, Duhl'ancara is of use, when cold is the cause of the sore eyes, and wlen thlte-y are made worse by recading, witl dimhess of siglit, and a sensll.ation as if sparks of fire weret flying out of tle eyes; pain over the eyes; worse when at rest; b entcer wle n wallking.ll ADMNISTIRATION the same as above. kEr aulcers on the eyeblalls, renmaining after the inflammation has and Silicea, each remedy dtilrin' times every evenilw ai dos;e (fiur glob.).

From Sylyphlilis or Venereal Disease. The ryes may be implicated in this disease, and become inflaimed, particularly when a gonorrhea is suppressed and transfetlrre, as it were, to thle eyes, or when syphilis has penetralfed the whole system. In the latter case, a hlomceopathic plhysician must be consulted. In Inflammation of the eyes and lids from s)uppressed qonorrhea, administer at first Aconite, as stated under \" Inflammation of the Eyes;\" after it Pulsatilla, in the same manner; thlen wait two or three days, and acid,.Mlercury, an(l Sulplhur; comrlnencl('in,' doses the first week; four (loses of the next remedy, the secorlo week; and so on, until better. 1S [Page 210](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/212) 210 AFFECTIONS OF THE EYES. In the real Syphilitic Eye-affections': Nitric acid, Mercury, and'lhuja, are the principal remedies-to be given as above. DIET AND REGIMEN.-See \" Inflammation of the Eye-ball,\" and \" Syphilis.\" d. From abuse of Mercury. This drug, given in allopathic doses, fiequently produces severe affections of the eye; for which must be given, Hepar sulph., iltric acid, Pulsat., and Sulphur, in the same manner as stated above, under \" Syphilitic Eye-Affections.\" Diet, also, the same. 4. STY ON THE EYELID. A sty is a small boil on the eyelid, produced by the swelling of the Meibomian glands, which are imbedded all along the margins of the lid. The specific remedy in the commencement of this complaint is Pulsatilla. A dose (four glob.) twice a day, until four doses are taken; then discontinue two days; and if not better, or if suppuration appears, take Mercury in the same manner, in alternation with Hepar sulph. If no suppuration, but induration takes place, or hard spots remain, and if the sties appear often, give Staphysag., a dose (four glob.) two or three times, during one week; and afterward, for two or three weeks, give each week two doses of Calca. carb. (each dose four glob.), until better; and if not, Sulphur, for the same length of time, and in the same manner. Externally, apply nothing; but bathe occasionally in warm water. DIET AND REGIMEN.-The diet light; no animal food; and regimen cool. 5. WEEPING OR WATERY EYES. If this complaint arises, as is mostly the case, fiom an obstruction of the lachrymal duct, or a swelling of its en [Page 211](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/213) CATARACT. 211 trance, in the internal corner of the eye, a honlmeopathic physician should be consulted. In the meantime, use remedies: Bellad., Pulsal., Calca. carb., Sili., Petrol., Sulph.; the remedies alternately, every day a dose (four glob.) of each, until the acute symptoms subside; the other remedies each for four or six weeks, every week two doses (six glob. each), until better. But if the watery eyes arise fiom a general weakness of the organ, Euphrasia and Spigelia in alternation, ever two or three days a dose (six glob.), will generally be found beneficial. Let this treatment be followed, at the end of two weeks, by two doses of Sulphur, on two successive nights (each dose six glob.). DIET.- The usual homceopathic diet must be observed during the whole time. 6. CATARACT. (Glaucoma.) This disease, which consists of the gradual darkening of the lens in the eye (thus preventing the light from reaching the optic nerve), is, in its commencement, curable by medicines, if carefully selected and applied. As this, however, ought to be done by a homceopathic physician, we will here merely notice a few remedies, which may be taken in the beginning, until a physician can be consulted. By this means, an operation for the cataract may frequently be avoided. Pulsatilla, Sulphur, Silicea, Conium, Phosphorus. ADMINISTRATION. -Give each remedy for four or six weeks, every three days one dose (six glob.), in the evening, until better, or until the next remedy has to be taken. DIET AND REGIMEN.-Light, without animal food; otherwise, the usual homoeopathic diet. weczC eyes; tllis latter is a defect in the optic nerve it[sclf, whicih is weakened or pairalyzed, in a greater oi less d'l c e. If this nerve is not much pairalyzed, so that only idill;lltss of sigllt exist.s, we call it amblyopiai, or weakness eof sif/;t; if the nerve is more or entirely paralyzed, it is incipient or real blind ness-amaurosis.'Ilis (lisease can be cured; but it must be'taken in time, ani d a homceopatlic physician ought to be counsultcd inmmediately, as delbay in this case is ve1ry under'' Cataract.\" If Ruta slhall be used, drop two drops of the tincture in half a, teacupful of water, and wash thle eyes tltree times a day with it; particularly when tle weakness of si3ght resulted from exce-ssi-e reading, sewing, etc., everything appelaring dusky and foggy before the eyes. For incipienCt blindness, (ive the same remedies as for simple weak.ness of sight. Atlacks of sudden blindness; if caused by congestion to the head, and accompanied with pain in thie head and convulsions, give Bellad. and Ifyoscyamus in solution (twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water), every fifteen minutes a teaspoonful, until better (see \"Congestion of blood to the Head\"); but for sudden blindness, without an apparent cause, give first Aconite; then Mercury; every two or three hours a dose (four glob.), alternately, until better. For nig1ht-blindness; Belladonna. For lday-blintdness, where the patient can only see in the evening; give Sulphur, and afterward Silicea. DIET thle same as in \"Cataract.'

DIET AND REGIMEN.-The usual homCeopathic diet; bathe the eyelids frequently in cold water. 12. FOREIGN SUBSTANCES IN TIHE EYE. If dust enters the eye and causes irritation, washing with cold water will be sufficient; but cream or sour milk will answer better, if lime, ashes or tobacco enters the eye. If a hard substance, or an insect has got into the eye, draw the eyelids apart, and turn the upper one over the lower one a couple of times, until it is felt that the substance is removed. If unable to remove it in this manner, do not rub the eye, but lie down, and bathe it in a solution of Arnica (five drops to half a teacupful of water). Internally, take Aconite, and try to sleep. If particles of iron have entered the eye, and alre fastened in the white or purple, use Arnica, as above stated, and have them extracted by a surgeon. If the eye becomes very much inflamed, take a few doses of Aconite, and afterward Sul5phur; and, if necessary, in a few days after, Calcarea carb.

T1HE eruptions which appear on or behind the ear are various, and generally require a chronic treatment to eradicate the disease entirely, which can be done only by a skillful homceopathic physician. To begin the cure, or if severe, acute sufferings, as swelling and inflammation of the ear, appear with the eruption, select from among the remedies given below, and read their symptoms in the \"Materia Medica\" at the end of the the ears: Pulsat., Lycopodium, Sulphur. each remedy for one week, every other day one dose (four glob.) until better, or until the next remedy has to be given. DIET AND REGIMEN.-The usual homceopathic diet; take particular care not to drive the eruption away by getting cold or by external applications. (215) [Page 216](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/218) 2 1 6 AFFECTIONS OF TIIE EARS. b. Mumps. (Parotitis. ) Tlhis disease consists in an inflammation of the great salivary glands, lying, under and in front of the ear; children ar e frequently subject to it, but it seldom attacks more than once in a lifetime. TREATMENT. \u2014\u2014 It is not a dangerous disease in its simple lorrm, and only requires to be kept warm by putting a handkerchief around it, and keeping the patient in the room. Intern;dlly give Mlerctury, which is almost a specific for this disease; every evening a dose (four glob.), until three or four doses are taken. Sometimes the glands of the neck participate, and remain swelled for three or four days. In this case, also, pursue the above treatment. But, if the mumps disappear suddenly, by striking in and falling upon the brain, so that the patient becomes delirious and unconscious, give Belladonna in solution (twelve globules in half a teacupful of water), every 1hour a teaspoonful, followed by Ilyoscyamus, in a few hours, if necessary. (See, also, \" Scarlet Fever,\" striking in.) But, if in striking in, it falls upon the stomach, give Carbo veg., in the same manner as Belladonna above, and, if not better in two or three hours, Arsezic, and after that Cocculus, if necessary, in the same manner. If it falls upon the testicles, creating a swellilng in those parts and inflammation, P'ulsatilla, Alercury, T17ux vom., every three or four hours a dose (three globules). If fever, restlessness, and erysipelatous redness are combined with it, particularly in damp weather, give BlIladonna and Rhus in alternation, in solution (twelve globules of each in separate teacups, each half full of water), a teaspoonful every three or four hours, until four of each remedy are given, or until better. If the mumps is very obstinate and very hard, give JaiU7i [Page 217](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/219) INFLAMMATION OF THE EAR. 217 carb., every evening one dose (six glob. until three doses are taken. If a catarrhalic state is connected with it, particularly hIoarseness, give Carbo vey. in the same manner. This same remedy suits if the patient has previously taken much calomel. DIET AND REGIMEN. \u2014The diet must be light and farinaceous; baked apples and stewed prunes, if desired, but neither animal food nor soups. The patient must be kept warm, and if feverish must stay in bed. 2. INTERNAL EAR. a. Inflammation of the Ear. ( Otitis.) This painful disease is generally caused by exposure to cold and damp weather; sometimes, however, by the striking in of eruptions. It manifests itself by violent burning, stitching, beating pains, deep in the ear, and finally by swelling and redness of both in and outside of the ear; frequently, in very severe cases, the brain is implicated, when in children, convulsions may ensue, with vomiting and cold extremities. TREATMENT.-The principal remedy is Pulsatilla. In solution (twelve globules in half a teacupful of water), every hour a teaspoonful until better, or until six teaspoonfuls are taken; then wait the same length of time and give one dose (four glob.) of Sulphur, after which, in two hours, repeat the Pulsat. until better. But, if the brain becomes affected, with or without convulsions, give Belladonna. In alternation with Aconite, if the fever is very high, every two or three hours a dose (four glob.); then wait four or six hours and give Belladonnacc and Coffea.Co, in the same manner, if great sensitiveness and restlessness remain. If an abscess is about to form, which is indicated by the continued beating pain in the ear, give Mercury, Lachesis and Hepar sulph., in alternation, every six hours a 19 [Page 218](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/220) 218 AFFECTIONS OF TIiE EARS. dose (four glob.) until better, or uintil two or three doses of each are taken. DIET AND REGIMEN.-The samle as in fever. 6. cEarache. (Otalgic.) Earache, commonly so termed, resembles the inflammaiton of the ear in the character of the pain, and is only different in regard to its origin, as it mostly appears after taking cold as a neuralgic and rheumatic affection, or in consequence of previous inflammations of the ear. There is little or no fever accompanying the attacks, which are generally of short du.. ration, and relieved speedily by the application of the following remedies: TREATMENT.-Pulsacilla is the first and principal remedy, particularly if the pains are darting and tearing, as if something would press out througic the ears; the outer ear is red, 0ot and swollen, or, there is stitching and tearing through the whole side of the face, almost depriving the patient of reason, particularly in females, or in persons inclined to chilliness and disposed to cry. Chamomile. The next best remedy, especially after taking cold, or when a perspiration has been suppressed suddenly; tearing, lancinating pains in the ear, which extend to the lobe of the ear; the patient is very cross, cannot bear pain, and is easily offended. Mllercury. After Pulsat. or Chamomile. If these are insufficient, or if the patient perspires a great deal without relief; thel ains are worse in a warm bed, and there is a chilly sensation in the ears, with moisture; the pains extend to the cheek and teeth. N~ux vomica. After Chamzomile, in persons of a lively, passionate disposition; when the pains are tearing and stinging, tending upward to the forehead and temples, and down into the facial bones; worse in the morning. [Page 219](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/221) EARACHE. 219 Arnica is more for sensitive, nervous persons, when the pain returns on the slightest occasion, with sensitiveness to noise, and pressing and stinging in and behind the ears, which feel hot internally. China suits frequently after Arnica or Pulsat.; if the tearing pains are felt more externally; are worse by touching the ear, which is red, stings, and rings. Belladonna. Similar to China, or as stated under Bella. donna in \" Inflammation of the Ear.\" Hepar. After Belladonna, when the pain shoots into the ear on blowing the nose, or when the pain is beating, throbbing, or roaring. Spigelia. When there is a painful aching, as if a large nail were sticking in the ear; with aching and tearing in the cheek bones. Dulcamara. When the pains increase during rest, especially at night, with nausea. ADMINISTRATION.-Every hour or two hours a dose (four glob.), until better. If the above remedies allay the worst symptoms, but there is still left a painfulness in the ear, particularly on the left side, or the pains increase in the evening or before midnight, give Sulphur, evening and morning, a dose (four glob.); but if worse on the right side, and after midnight, toward morning, or during the forenoon, give Calcarea carb., the same as SuIJPhur. In very small children, after Pulsat. and Chamomile (two glob. each) have been given at intervals of one or two hours, give Cofea and Belladonna in the same manner, and afterward Cofteao' and Belladonna\"c,, every hour alternately, a dose (two glob.) until better. DIET AND REGIMEN.-The diet light; no meat, but fruit and farinaceous substances. Externally, use heated flannels or bags, filled with heated bran or scorched flour. [Page 220](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/222) 220 AFFECTIONS OF THE EARS. c. THimminig, Buzzing in the Ears. As a symptom it invariably accompanies earache, running of the ears and their inflammation, and will disappear with them; but, when it appears alone, it is caused generally by congestion to the head, from catching cold, or other diseases. Pulsatilla relieves it, if worse in the evening. IVzx vomica, if worse in the morning. Dulcamara, if worse at night. Mercury, in persons inclined to perspire much. Chamomile, in persons who do not perspire easily. China, in persons who have taken much calomel, or where the noise in the ear is more a hissing, singing, or ringing noise. Carbo veg., if China does not relieve, or the noise is worse in damp weather. Sulphur, if Carbo veg. does not relieve, or the noise is combined with great sensitiveness to sounds, in which case it ought to be alternated with Aconite. ADMINISTRATION. \u2014Of the remedy selected, must be given, one dose (six glob.), on two successive evenings, and then discontinued three days before selecting another remedy, if no improvement has taken place. APPLICATION OF WATER, in the form of cold foot and sittingbaths, is recommended in this disease, beside the use of the proper homceopathic remedies. DIET.-The usual homceopathic diet. d. Hardness of Rearing. Deafness. This complaint is very frequent, and as it is often combined with other chronic diseases of the ear, it ought to be treated by a skillful homceopathic physician. When it is of a recent date it may be cured easily, but not so readily when of long standing. Sometimes it is caused by the accumulation of ealrwax, in which case have it removed by skillful hands. If, after such an operation, great painfulness remains in the car, [Page 221](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/223) HARDNESS OF HEARING -DEAFNESS. 221 put a few drops of Arnica solution (two drops of arnica tincture to three tablespoonfuls of water, well shaken), into the ear and lie down. If the earwax is very hard to remove, put, before its removal, a few drops of warm milk or sweet oil into the ear. If there is a want of earwax, or too great dryness of the ear, give Carbo veg., particularly after a suppression of fever and ague by quinine, every other night one dose (four glob.) three times; then discontinue eight days, and if not better, give Graphites, particularly after suppression of an habitual eruption, such as tetter, or where there is a humming or thundering in the ears, especially at night; give it in the same manner as Carbo veg. If no better after Graphites, try Lachesis, N~itric acid, and Petroleum, one after the other, in the same manner. If there is difficulty of hearing, with running of the ears, select among the remedies prescribed for this complaint especially, Pulsat., -Mercury, Sulphur, and Calcarea carb., to be given in the same manner as above. If it is in consequence of congestion to the head, give, in preference, Belladonna, Coffea, iVux vomica, Sulphur, Silicea, commencing with the first, evening and morning one dose (four glob.), and wait two days before the next one is given. If it appears after acute eruptions, such as measles, etc., give, If after measles, Pulsat., and Carbo veg.; If after sulphf.; If after small-pox, iMercury and Sulphur-every other evening a dose (six glob.), alternately, until better. If it is caused by a cold in the head, or a chill of the whole body, give the remedies for these complaints (see these articles), particularly, however, Chamomile, Arsenic, Iachesis, 1~ercury, Sulphur, and Pulsat., in the same manner as there prescribed. If it arises from a suppressed cold (rheumatism), give [Page 222](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/224) 222 AFFECTIONS OF THE EARS. Bryonia and ]Rhus, every two hours a dose (four glob ), three times each; and afterward D)ulcamara and Sulphur, if necessary, every evening one dose (six glob.), for four or six days. Sometimes hardness of hearing ensues after intermittent fevers have been suppressed by the use of quinine; in this case give Carbo veg., Pulsatilla, Sulphur, and Calcarea carb., every week one remedy, on two successive evenings, one dose (six glob.), until better. If caused by the suppression of chronic eruptions, or ulcers healed by salves, give Sulphur or Antimonium crud. (See \"' Eruptions.\")': is swelled tonsils, give Mercury, Staphysag., Nitric acid, and Aurum, every week one remedy, on two successive evenings one dose (six glob.), until better. If caused by the suppression of a discharge from the ears or nose, give Pulsatilla, Mercury, Lachesis, Belladonna, and Hepar sulph., every two or three days one remedy (once a day a dose four glob.), until better. N. B. Do not use any external means, such as oils, however much they may be recommended. e. Running of the Ears. (Otorrhoea.) A running of the ears frequently remains after the inflammation has subsided, and is then beneficial in diminishing local tension. In such a case, continue the use of the remedies for \" Inflammation of the Ear;\" after which it will generally soon disappear. The principal remedies are Pulsatilla, 2Mercury, and Sulphur. If it succeeds the measles, give Pulsatilla and Sulphur, for four days; each remedy on two successive evenings (six glob.), a dose. If after scarlet fever, give Bellad., Mercury, Hepar, Sulpth. and Lycopodiumv, in the same manner. Mercury, Sulph. each remedy for six or eihl,,t dlays (on two successive evenings one dose, six glob.), until bettelr. In regard to the quality of the discharged substance, give, if it is Purule selected remedy, for six or eight days, on two successive evenings, one dose (six glob.), until better. The sudden suppression of a running of the ear may produce dangerous consequences, which must be attended to imnmediately. If, after such a suppression, the glands of the neck, or in flont of the ear, begoin to swell or get hard, give Pulsat.,,afercury, Bellaed.; if severe headache or fever ensues, give Bellad.; if not better in a few hours, Bryonia. If the suppression is caused by getting cold in damp weather, give Dulcamara; and if not better in three or four hours, Rhus and Bellad., in alternation. If, after a suppression, the testicles begin to swell, give Pulsat., Arnica, Mer'cury, Yux' vnom. ADnITNIsTRATION.-Give every two or three hours a dose (iour glob.), alternately, until better. If by these directions no relief is obtained, consult a homeopathic physician as soon as possible. DIEET AND REGICMEN.The same as in' Earache.\" f. Polyputs of the Ear. These excrescenses appear frequently, during a long-continued runninog of the earl; particularly if accidental injuries by ear-picks, etc., have taken place. They either have a [Page 224](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/226) 224 AFFECTIONS OF THIE EARS. small or broad basis, whence they grow to a size, so as to fill up the whole internal ear. They ar; nriot painful, but always discharge an offensive mucus, and bleed easily when touched. They are not so dangerous as they are annoying and obstinate; and require but a proper homeopathic treatment, by a skillful physician. In no case is it advisable to extricate them by force; we have remedies which will remove them. The principal medicine is Calcarea carb., of which every second day, in the evening, a dose (six glob.) may be given, followed by Staphysagria, in a like manner, until medical aid can be obtained. If the polypus is very large, touch it twice a day with the tincture of the gum of Opium, conveyed into the ear on a sponge. Otherwise, keep the ear clean by frequent injections of milk and water. g. Foreign Substances in the Eatr. Insects sometimes get into the ear; in such cases, drop sweet oil into the ear. This kills the insect, and enables us to take it out easily. If a bean, or anything that will swell, gets into the ear, bend the point of a large and stout sewing needle a very little, so as to form a fine hook; enter the ear with it cautiously, without touching the walls of the ear, and press it into the side of the swollen substance, which is thus caught by the hook, and may be slowly extracted. After such an operation, it is necessary to drop into the ear a few drops of an Arnica solution (two drops of the Arnica tincture to two tablespoonfuls of water, and well shaken), and give internally, Arnica and Pulsat., in alternation, every two or three hours a dose (four glob.). If there is fever and delirium, give Bellad. and Aconite, in the same manner. If painfulness still remains, give, in a couple of days after. ward, Sulphur, evening and morning a, dose (four glob.). __ ~ ~ ~ __________________ \u2014 ___ ____J [Page 225](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/227) CHAPTER IX. AFFECTIONS OF T'HE NOSE. 1. INFLAMMATION OR SWELLING OF THE iNOSE. The nose, from its position and function, is exposed to a great many diseases and injuries. a. EExternal injuries, which may befall the nose, from the slightest contusion to the severest blow or cut, require Arnica internally, every four or five hours a dose (four glob.), and externally, the same remedy in solution (twelve drops of the tincture to a teacupful of water, well mixed). Arnica will also stop the bleedino caused by severe blows and other injuries of the nose. b. izternal causes for infltammazion and swelling of the nose are scrofdela, the abuse of ardlent spirits and calomel, or the congestion attending a cold. In cases of scrofulous or erysip2elatous inflammation of the nose, give -Belladonna. If the nostrils are swollen and sore; with heat, redness, and pain, outwardly and inwardly, attended with a burning, pricking, and dryness; smelling sensitive, or absent; pains as if bruised, on toucling the nose; give, evening and morning a dose (four glob.); and if not better, aftei two days, give I]epar sulph., in the same manner, until better; followed by Miercury, in the same manner; and ii this does not relieve, give -Bryonia, followed by Rhus, in the same manner; particularly the latter, in cases of poisoning by weeds. (225) [Page 226](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/228) i-,226 nd~AFFECTIONS OF TtHE NOSE. When caused by the excessive use of ardent spirits, give Laczlesis, Jlrsenic, Pulsat., the otlher, in the same manner, until better. If caused by abuse of calomel, give Aurumn, Bellad., Lachesis, ckp)ar, ill the same imanner, until better. If caused by cold, see 1\" Cold in the Head.\" Black spots frequently appear on the outside of the nose, for which Sulphur, or else Graplhites, may be taken, on two successive evenings one dose (four glob.). For red spots: Phosphoric acid, in the same manner. When the end of the nose is red, give Rlhus and Ccalcarea curb., in the same manner. If the redness on the end of the nose is copper-color, give Arsenic and Veratruaz, in the same manner. When warts appear onil the nose, give Caustic., every week two doses (four glob.), and wash with the same externally, uLntil lbetter. DIET AND REGIMEN must be strictly homceopathic, as laid down in the introduction. 2. ErUPrIoNs ON TH-I NOSE.-ITCHEING OF THE NOSE. a. EZruptions on the NVose. The eruptions on the nose are generally of an herpetic or tettery character, and require, for their radical and safe extinction, a long-continued, careful, homoeopathic treatment. The use of allopathic remedies, in the form of salves and ointments, is, in the highest degree, dangerous and ought to be at once rejected; as they may cause the disease to disappear externally, and fall on the eyes or lungs. It is much better to allow the eruption to stay where it is (as it can do no harm there), than to endanger, with its repression, the life of the patient. To commence its radical cure, however, give /Rhus, if the redn-ess is on the point of the nose, with soreness to touch. [Page 227](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/229) BLEEDING OF THE NOSE \u2014-EPISTAXIS. 227 Antimoniumn, if it is all over and around the nose, with soreness in the corners. Causticumn, if it is on the point of the nose. Viitric acid, if the eruption is tettery, with stinginy in the nose, as if from splinters on touch; itching sensation; scabby eruption. ADMINISTRATION.-These remedies to be given every three or four days a dose (six glob.), until better, or another one is indicated. b. Itching of tle.Nose Is merely a symptom of other diseases in the system; particularly in children, where it indicates an irritation near or below the navel, either from worms, inflammation of the bowels, or swelling of the glands in the abdomen. For its treatment, see these diseases. 3. BLEEDING OF THE NOSE. (Epistaxis.) Some persons are subject to this complaint constitutionally, sometimes relieving, often injuring them very much. For weak lungs, with tendency to bleeding at the nose, apply immediately to a homceopathic physician. Meanwhile, take Aconite and Sul2phur alternately, every three or four days a dose (six glob.), until better, or until four doses of each are taken; afterward, if necessary, Sepia and Carbo veg., in the same manner. If the bleeding appears in females periodically, every month, and the menses have ceased, restore the latter by the proper treatment (see \" Diseases of Females\"), and the former will cease of itself. If it appears in the beginning of a typhoid or other fever, or irregularly during its period, it is not considered a very favorable sign; but if it appears on the critical days of such a fever (say the third, fifth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, eightcenth, or twenty-first day), it is thought to be favorable, and ought not to be interfered with immediately (see under [Page 228](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/230) 228 AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. \"Fevers\"), except it becomes too profuse, when China will give relief. If it results from determination of blood to the head, give Aconile, and Bellad., as directed in \"Congestion to the Head. \" If it happens after a blow or cut of the nose, apply Arnica, externally and internally, as stated under \"Inflammation of the Nose.\" If it arises from the use of spiritous liquors, give NVux vom., every two or three hours a dose (four glob.). If it is fiom overheating, lie quietly, with the head elevated, and take Aconite and Bryonia alternately, every hour or thirty minutes a teaspoonful, in solution (twelve glob. of each in separate teacups half full of water). If it is in consequence of great exertion, give PRhus, and Carbo vey., in the same manner, until better. If it occurs mostly during the night, give RAhus, Bryonia, and Belladonna, alternately, every evening a dose in the morning: XNux veom., Bryonia, Carbo veg., in the same manner. If it occurs on the most trivial occasions, after eating', etc., give Silicea, Sulphur, Sepia, Calcarea carb., Graphitles, Lycopodizum, at intervals of from eight to ten days, each remedy for four weeks (six globules for a dose), to eradicate the disposition to it. Bleeding from the nose in children, from worms, requires Cina, and M-ercury, in the same manner. During the attack, and to allay the itchlling in the nose, give CinaCC, every two or three hours a dose (four glob.). If it occurs during a cold in the head, Pzlsctt., and Arsenic will be necessary, alternately, morning and evening a dose (six glob.), until better. If persons are naturally weak, or rendered so by loss of blood from the nose, give China in solution (twelve glob. to half a teacupful of water), every half hour or hour a tea [Page 229](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/231) COLD IN THE HEAD CORYZA. 229 spoonful, until better, or afterward Ferrum, if necessary, in the same manner. Externally use nothing but cold water or ice, on the root of the nose, keep perfectly quiet, and do not remove the clots of blood from the nose, if they form themselves. Lint pressed tightly under the upper lip frequently stops the severest bleeding of the nose. The diet must be of a cooling nature; nothing should be used in the least degree stimulating; no meat. 4. COLD IN THE HEAD. (Coryza.) Influenza, catarrhal fevers, and colds on the lungs, generally commence with affecting the mucous membrane of the nose, whence the disease descends into the larynx and bronchia. We will here treat only this diseased condition of the nose, which manifests itself mostly by sneezing, obstruction, or running of the nose, with excoriations, headache, feverishness, and affections of the eyes. If the disease runs into one of the above-mentioned diseases, see their respective chapters. TREATMENT.-In all cases where persons are attacked with a cold in the head, first give JNux vom. and Mercury, in alternation, every four or six hours a dose (four glob.) for twentyfour hours; and then, if not better, select one from among the following remedies, which may be given three times in twenty-four hours (four glob. in a dose). If the patient is better, discontinue two days without giving any medicine, observing the diet, however; and then give a dose of Sulphur (four glob.) on two successive evenings, which will complete the cure. N7Vux vomica must be given for the following symptoms: either dryness and obstruction of the nose, with heaviness in the forehead and impatient humor; or running of the nose in the morning, but dryness in the eveniny or during the night; with dryness of the mouth, and constipation of the bowels; the patient feeling better when exercising or warm. [Page 230](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/232) 230 AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. Mercury. Frequent sneezing, parlticularly when coming from the cool air into a warm room, profuse running of the nose, with swelling, redness, and excoriation of the nostrils; itching, and aching pains on pressing the nose and cheekbones; soreness and pains in the limbs, copious perspiration at night;; great thirst; patient feels worse in the warmth, yet cannot bear the cold. H]elpar. For persons who have already taken calomel, or were not relieved entirely by the homceopathic Mercury; or when every exposure to cold air renews the complaint, with a headache; worse by movement; or where the cold attacks only one nostril. Dulcamara. If the slightest exposure renews the obstruction and the patient feels worse when at rest. Euphrasia. When, with profuse running of the nose, there is redness and soreness of the eyelids, with profuse flow of tears, and confused sensation in the head. Belladonna. If Hepar does not relieve, or when the smell is alternately too acute or too dull. Lachesis. Frequent sneezing, with profuse running of the nose, with swelling and excoriation of the nostrils and lips: or else, obstruction of the nose, humming in the ears, illhumor, constipation, and unfitness for meditation. Particularly after IVz= vont. Arsenic. Obstruction of the nose, alternately with profuse running and excoriation of the nostrils, with bleeding; restlessness and sleeplessness in the night; a desire to drink frequently, but little at a time; feels better in a warm air; suits well after zuV~x vomica. Chamomile. When the cold is caused by suppressed perspiration, as is often the case in children, with feverishness and drowsiness; stupor; one cheek pale and cool, the other red and hot; soreness of the nostrils; cracked lips and acrid, smarting mucus in the nose. Pulsatilla. When the patient loses his appetite and smell, [Page 231](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/233) SUPPRESSION OF TIHE CATARRH. 231 and the nose secretes a yellowish, thick, offensive mucus, with heaviness and confusion in the head; particularly when toward niygh and in the warimth oft a room the obstruction of the nose increases; feels better in the open air, yet shivering; disposed to shed tears. It is beneficial before Lycopodium, and follows well aftel Chamomoile. Lycopodium. Obstruction of the nose, especially at night; with the sense of smnell too acute; tearing pain in the forehead; dryness of' the mouth, without thirst; constipation of the bowels, with melancholy, sadness, and whining mood. Follows well after Pulsatilla or Lachesis. Sulphur. Obstruction and dryness of the nose, or profuse secretion of thick, yellowish, puriform mucus; sneezing; blowing of blood from the nose with excoriation and soreness of the nostrils; worse in the night and in wet weather. APPLIcArION OF WATER is very beneficial in this disease and should not be neglected at the same time that the homceopathic remedies are administered. The principal modes of applying it aire the following: The patient, staying quietly at home in a room not too -warm, applies a wet bat-ndage around the breast and abdomen, and lying in bed well covered, tries to perspire, which may be fostered by drinking cold water; after having lain in a perspiration for sonme time, he takes a lukewarm ablution. This process is repeated once a day. Bathing in cold water is injurious. Diet must be very moderate; in fact, the patient should not eat and drink anything but dry toast, gruels, and cold water; meats or stimulating drinlks are very objectionable. Sup2pression of the Catarrh, or Cold in the fead. If' the running stops suddenly and headache ensues, give Aconite a few doses, every two or three hours a dose (four glob.); if not better, give Pulsat. and China, alternately, every six hours a dose (four glob.). If hard breathing or asthma ensues, give ]jpecac. and Bryonia, every two hours a [Page 232](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/234) 232 AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. dose (four glob.), alternately, until better, or until three doses of each are taken; and if not relieved give Arsenic and Sulphaur. alternately, every four or six hours a dose (four glob.), until better. If the eyes are affected, give Belladonna, Lachesis, and Hepar, in alternation, every six hours a dose (four glob.) until better. If inflammation of the windpipe or lungs ensues, give Aconite and Bryonia, alternately, in solution (twelve globules in half a teacupful of water), every two hours a teaspoonful. If a person is subject, on the slightest occasion, to cold in the head, bathe the neck and breast frequently in cold water; snuff cold water up into the nose when washing the face, and take Silicea, every eight days a dose (six glob.). N. B. We would remark here, that in the treatment of children, where it is difficult to distinguish the symptoms with sufficient clearness for the selection of a remedy, the alternate use of Chamomile and Belladonna should be adopted in most cases, giving every three or four hours a dose (two glob.), which removes the cold. If drowsiness sets in and sleepi. ness, with eyes half open, the use of B1ryoLia and Hellebor. n. is preferable, given in solution, as in \" Dropsy of the Brain.\" After a few days, Sulphur is frequently necessary to complete the cure. DIET AND REGIMEN.-If there is fever, see the appropriate diet in \"Fevers;\" if without fever, the usual homceopathic diet. During a cold in the head, abstain from the usual bathing on feeling worse after it. 5. ULCERATION IN THE NOSE. ( Catarrh. Ozcena narium.) This is a chronic disease, where an ulcer has formed in the upper part of the nose (extending sometimes to the frontal sinus), from which an offensive matter is discharged, frequently mixed with blood; as long as it discharges freely the accompanying pain is inconsiderable, but when the ulcer [Page 233](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/235) feverishness ensues with headache, swelling and redness of the nose, thirst, etc. All these symptoms cease as soon as the ulcer begins to run again. If this disease is located in the nose, it is called ozcena narium; if in tile cavity of the cheek-bones, ozcena antri Highmori. As both these diseases are difficult to cure, being caused by scrofulous or syphilitic disorders, it is necessary to consult a lhomceopathic physician; yet we will point out the remedies with which the cure may be commenced. a. Ozcena nartum. Catarrh. TREATMENT. \u2014The cure may be commenced with Belladonna, every second evening a dose (six glob.), particularly in females; continue this treatment for one week, followed by Aurum, in the same manner, and this followed by Mercury, if necessary, after which take Sfulphur in the same manner. If, however, the ulcer does not discharge, and there is fever and:l eat, give Belladonna and Aconite, alternately, in solution (twelve globules in half a teacupful of water), every two hours a teaspoonful. b. Ozcena antri Highmori. The same remedies as above, but if there are severe pains in the cheek-bones, throbbing, splitting, or bursting, give Arsenic in solution, every two hours a teaspoonfulf until better. If the discllarge is thick and yellow, give Lycopod., every other evening a dose (four glob.), until better. For a chronic ulceration in the lower part of the nose, and scabs on the nostrils, take.Mercury, Lachesis, Calcarea, L4/copodium, Grap hites, Sulp2hur, each remedy for two weeks, every five days a dose (six glob.); after taking one remedy in this manner for two weeks, wait one week before the next remedy is commenced. Continue this treatment until better. APPLICATION OF WATER, in these affections of the nose, 20 [Page 234](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/236) 234 AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. must be local as well as general, to be beneficial. The parts affected must be friequently bathed in cold or milkwarm water; during thile night a wet compress may be applied. Every day once, the patient must perspire in the wet sheet, and take the usual ablution after it; beside, enjoy plenty of exercise in the open air. DIET AND REGIMEN.-The usual homceopathic diet. Frequent applications of cold water are recommended. 6. POLYPUS OF THE NOSE- CANCER OF THE NOSE. The polypuus of the nose is of frequent occurrence, and can be cured by the application of the homceopathic medicines, as, also, that variety of this disease which consists in the thickening or enlargement of the cartilages of the nose. As these disorders, however, require medical advice, we merely mention here such remedies as may commence the treatment of both varieties with equal propriety. TREATMENT. -Sclaphysacria, Phosp/horus, Calcarea., Silicea, Sepia, each remedy (every five days a dose, six glob.) for three weeks, and then discontinue for one week before the next remedy is commenced, until better. Cancer in the Nose. \u2014The treatment of this disease ought to be confined to the application of the proper internal remedies, as the cause of it lies in the system. By applying early to a homoeopathic physician it is sometimes cured, while under the allopathic treatment a cure is never effected.

FOREIGN SUBSTANCES IN THE NOSE. If a child has put a bean into its nose, let it draw in its breath, then close its mouth, and make it force the breath out through the nose; or tickle the nose with a feather to make [Page 235](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/237) FOREIGN SUBSTANCES IN THlE NOSE. 235 it sneeze. Sometimes the bean can be pushed back so as to fall into the mnouth, or it can be extracted with a needle, the point of which is turned into a small hook. If this does not succeed, apply to a surgeon. After the operation apply Arnica in water as usual, and give internally Arnica and Rhus, alternately, every six hours a dose (four glob.). In a couple of days give one dose (four glob.) of Sulphur. [Page 236](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/238) C HAPTER X. AFFECTIONS OF THE FACE, LIPS, AND JAWS. 1.

In very severe cases of neuralgia in the face I have seen the most beneficial effects from the tincture of Aconite (three drops to half a teacupful of water, every fifteen or twenty minutes a teaspoonful); in such cases its external application on the parts principally affected is also recommended. Otherwise, apply nothing externally but cold water bandages. DIET AND REGIMEN.-The usual homceopathic diet. Abstain, even in health, from coffee and tea, and bathe frequently. 4.

Spots, yellow (lepatic), on the face, require principally the use of Sulphur and Sepia, in the same manner as above. Cancer of the face: see the remarks and treatment of \"Cancer of the Nose.\" DIET.-The usual homeopathic diet in chronic diseases. 5. PARALYSIS OF TItE FACE AND JAW. In this disease, the muscles of the face have lost their powel to act and be moved by the will; consequently, the affected part of the face or jaw hangs down; it mostly results fiom [Page 241](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/243) PARALYSIS OF TIIE FACE AND JAW. 241 attacks of apoplexy, rheumatism, loss of fluids, and consequent debility, or suppression of an eruption.

TOOTHACHE. (Odontalgia.) THE proper culture of the teeth is important, in regard to health and comfort; and, as they form a part of the digestive system, their soundness depends a great deal on the healthy state of the stomach and bowels; consequently, whatever may derange these organs, will act more or less injuriously on the; teeth, and ought to be guarded against. Tihe extremes of hbob an(l cold drinks should be avoided, and the teeth kept scrupu lously clean; the best method for doing this is to brush them gently with a soft brush dipped in cold water. All medicated tooth-powders are more or less injurious. If tartar adheres to the teeth, have it cautiously scraped off, by a competent person; and if any damage is visible, externally, consult immediately a skillful dentist; as he can easily repair it, while an unskillful practitioner makes the evil worse. We cannot be too careful in the selection of a dentist. If habitually predisposed to toothache, consult a homceopathic physician, who will be able to eradicate this complaint, which has either a scrofulous or rheumatic basis. But to commence such a cure, if the toothache is recent, from cold, etc., take some of the following remedies, which may afford speedy relief. TREATMENT. \u2014In most cases of toothache, try first the following remedies, in this order: Chamomile, Bqa'onia, Metrcury, Sulphur, if the TOOTHACHE - ODONTALGIA. 243 Chamomile, Belladonna, Mercury, and Sulphur, if a female or child. ADMINISTRATION. Give, according to the severity of the pain, from one to six hours a dose (four glob.), alternately, until better. If, however, among the remedies given below, one is found which will suit exactly, give this first of all. In administering the following medicines, be careful not to give another one, when the remedy previously given has already afforded some relief; let it then have time to show its effect; say from one to six hours. Do not use creosote, and other medicines, such as opiates; as they are very injurious to the general health, and to the teeth especially. Neither allow the teeth to be extracted so very readily; as frequently it does not relieve, and can be obviated altogether, by the use of one of the following remedies. Select with care, and give as a dose, four globules at a time. Before taking any medicine, cleanse the mouth of everything which may have been used previously; particularly of those things which have a smell, such as creosote, etc. The principal remedies recommended in this article for toothache are the following: Belladonna, give their detailed symptoms, we will state a few general indications, which are of great service in selecting the proper medicine.

CARIES OF THE TEETH. (Carious Teeth.) For pains in carious teeth the principal remedy is Antimon., Chamomile, or else Staphysag., NuZx orm., lfercury, China, Pulsat., and Sulphur. Give of these every three or six hours a dose (four glob.), until relieved. For a disposition to caries in the teeth, give first Staphysag., then Sulphur, then Calcarea carb., every week two doses of one remedy, commencing with the first, each dose six globules. Beside this treatment consult a good dentist, as teeth may frequently be saved by a simple operation, while without it they would decay in a short time. 3. OFFENSIVE BREATH. If it is from carious teeth, consult a good dentist immedidiately; or, if that is impossible, clean out the hollow teeth yourself, with cotton or rolls of paper, and fill the cavities with wax. Offensive breath, caused by neglect in cleaning the teeth from tartar or particles of food attached to them after eating, can be removed only by the most careful attention to rinsing the mouth frequently and using the brush freely. Sometimes offensive breath is a symptom of other diseases, such as swelling and inflammation of the gums and glands from the abuse of Mercury. (See this article.) Where it cannot be traced to any particular cause, however, try to relieve the patient by giving the following remedies: If it appears only in the morning, give Arnica, NVux vomica, Belladonna, Silicea, Sulphur. 252](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/254) 2.52 AFFECTIONS OF THE TEETH, GUMS, AND If in. the evezing or at night, Pulsct., Suliphur.

Administer every evening of one of the above remedies indicated, one dose (six glob.) for one or two weeks, when another remedy may be selected if necessary. N. B. Tile smell caused by onions, garlic, or horse-radish, may be destroyed by taking a little wine, or eating a pear or boiled beets. 4. BAD TASTE IN THE MOUTIH. A great many diseases, such as fevers and disorders of the stomach, lhave a bad taste in tile mouth as an accompanying symptom, which will disappear with the principal complaint; this must be looked for in thle proper chapters; but sometimes it appears as a solitary synmptom, for wllich the following remedies many Dulcanm.; if after dlinking, after a meal or in the evening, INFLAMMATION AND SWELLING OF THE TONGUE, 253 ADMINISTRATION. \u2014Take one dose (four glob.) of t,.e appropriate medicine once a day for a couple of days, which is generally sufficient. If very bad, take two or three times a day. 5. INFLAMMATION AND SWELLING OF THE TONGUE. ( Glossitis.) This disease is not of frequent occurrence. When it appears the tongue is swollen, either in part or wholly, often to a great extent, so as to fill the whole cavity of the mouth, thereby rendering it extremely difficult to speak, swallow, or even breathe. The disease, if not checked in time by the proper homceopathic remedies, frequently runs into suppuration or hardening of the substance of the tongue, after which the fever, which is generally very intense during the height of the inflammation, gradually subsides, or it terminates in gangrene of the tongue and surrounding parts. CAUSES. \u2014This disease is mostly caused by local injuries, such as from the points of decayed teeth, the sting of a bee, or by rheumatic and catarrhalic influences. TREATMENT.-In the commencement of the disease, if the tongue has been injured externally, give Arnica, rinsing the mouth with a solution of ten drops of the tincture to a teacupful of water three or four times a day. If injured by burning or scalding, give Urtica urens, in a similar manner. But if real inflammation of the substance sets in, and there is great fever, give first Aconite, in solution (twelve globules in half a teacupful of water), every hour or two a teaspoonful alternately with Apis mellifica until better. Jfercury is almost a specific after Aconite, particularly when there is great swelling and heat of the tongue and surrounding glands; it may be given either alone, every three or four hours a dose (four glob.), or alternately with Belladonna, if the mouth is very dry and the pain excessive, with great thirst and congestion to the head; also with Apis mellifica. [Page 254](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/256) 254 AFFECTIONS OF THE TEETH, GUMTS. AND MOUTH. Puzls'atilla is beneficial in cases caused by suppression of gouty, or hemorrhoidal affections. If indications of cyangrene appear, Arsenic and Lachesis are the principal remedies, alternately to be given as above in Belladonna and l1lercury. If ulceration of the tongue takes place, see \" Ulcers.\" If the swelling' has become so enormous, as to endanger the life of the patient, make longitudinal incisions in the tongue. ADMINISTRATION, DIET, AND REGIMEN. - As in inflammatory fevers. 6. CANKER OF THE MOUTH. (Stomacace.) This disease consists in an inflammation and ulceration of the inside of the mouth and surrounding parts, preceded by general lassitude, loss of appetite, gastric derangement, and feverishness. The local affection soon makes its appearance with heat, redness, and sensitiveness of the gums, which swell, become spongy, and retract from the teeth; presently small ulcers appear on the gums, spreading to the lips, tongue, palate, and inside of the cheeks, smelling very offensively. Sometimes the glands of the throat and mouth swell and participate in the inflammation, secreting large quantities of a putrid, acrid saliva, which runs constantly from the mouth. In such a state the patient looks like one who has been deeply salivated by the abuse of mercury; we find, also, the same weakness and feverishness. TREATMENT. \u2014Mercury must be given first, as it is almost the.specific in this disease, but not, of course, in those cases which have been produced by its own abuse; in such cases see \" Diseases from the abuse of Mercury.\" ADMINISTRATION.-Dissolve twelve globules in half a teacupful of water, and give every three or four hours a teaspoonful until four or six are taken; if better the patient needs no more medicine; if not better, or about the same, [Page 255](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/257) CANKER OF THE MOUTH-STOMACACE. 255 select one of thle following remedies, preparing and giving it in tile same manner as the mercury.

Arsenic, llfercury, or Al.x vomnica. x/Fxternally use nothing but cold water, with which the mouth should be frequently washed; sometimes lemon-juice or sage tea is beneficial, at least not objectionable, when its use can be borne. DIET.-Only the mildest nourishment, such as gruels, milk and water, etc., is allowed; no meat or soup of meat until the patient is decidedly convalescent. 7. INFLAMMITION OF THE PALATE. See \"Sore Throat.\" 8. ABSCESS IN THE GUMS.-GUM-BOILS.- SWELLING OF THE JAW-BONE. Before an abscess in the gums, or a gum-boil, is formed, there is much inflammation and swelling in the parts affected, which requires the use of Aconite and Belladonna in alternation, every three or four hours a dose (four glob.), until better; or, if not better after twelve hours, MJfercury and iepar in the same manner. If the boil has formed, give Silicea, evening and morning a dose (four glob.), for three or four days; and if not better in eight days, give Ccalcarea carb., in the same manner, and after this Staphysag. The same treatment is suitable for swelling and ulceration of the jaw-bone, produced by carious teeth, or after the extraction of a tooth. DIET light, and according to the homceopathic rules. 9. SCURVY. (Scorbulus.) This disease exhibits all the symptoms described in the previous article, on \" Canker of the Mouth.\" It differs. however, as regards its origin and progress, which is slow and chronic. The real scurvy principally affects persons who are in [Page 257](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/259) SCURVY - SCORBUTUS. 257 circums tances which deprive them of fresh provisions (such as sailors), and expose them to damp and cold. If, at the same timle, there is want of exercise, impure air, and uncleanliness, together witlh depression of spirits, the disease will progress rapidly. It, begins with swelling of the gums, which become spongy, discolored, and bleed easily; producing fetid breath; afterwlard the lower extremities begin to swell, and the skin shows tettery and livid spots; face looks lead-colored and bloated; urine is offensive, and the stools are extremely fetid; hemorrhlages from the nose, teeth, tongue, and the urinary organs now ensue; the general debility and melancholy increases, and ulcers make their appearance on various parts; after wlhich, a general dissolution of the system takes place. THrEATMENT. -A great part of the cure of this disease lies in the removal of its causes; and this should be done, if possible; substituting fresh provisions for salt; also, fresh fruits and vegetables, oranges, lemons, cider, vinegar, spruce-beer, sourcrout, etc. Beside, give the following remedies: iki'ercury. If this has not already been used to excess in the disease (in which case Carbo veg. should commence the cure), give it for the following symptoms: Red, spongy, ulcerated, and easily-bleeding gumrs, with burning pains at night; looseness of the teeth; the whole inside of the mouth covered with ap]lthe or thrush; fetid smell of the mouth, and ulcers; profuse discharge of offensive or sanguineous saliva; loose, scalding evacuations; dark-red, fetid urine; great exhaustion and debility, with inexpressible feeling of depression of body and mind. ADMINIsTRATIoN. \u2014Dissolve twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water, and give every four or six hours a teaspoonful, for six times; then discontinue the medicine for twenty-four or thirty-six hours, and, if improving, for a longer time; if not, however, select the next best remedy. CGrbo veq. Particularly in persons who have taken much 22 [Page 258](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/260) 258 AFFECTIONS OF THE TEETH, GUMS, AND MOUTH. mercury, or when there are burning ulcers in the mouth, which bleed profusely at times, and discharge an acrid, fetid matter; great weakness in body and mind. XTWx vomica. For the same symptoms as stated in \" Canker of the Mouth.\" (See this article.) Arsenic. See \" Canker of the Mouth.\" Beside these symptoms, it will mitigate the sufferings of the patient, in the most severe forms of this, disease; ulcers are either very painful or not sensitive; look dark and livid; so does also, the whole skin, which is bluish, cold, and extremely dry; extreme restlessness, particularly at night. NTitric acid and Sulphur. See, \" Canker of the Mouth.\" ADMINISTRATION of these remedies, the same as'fercury, above. DIET.-AS in \" Canker of the Mouth.\" 10. SALIVATION. (Ptyalism.) This disease is not always caused by the abuse of mercury; but frequently occurs after taking cold, or accompanies attacks of fever, such as scarlet, etc. Sometimes it appears in diseases of the reproductive system, as a critical discharge by the action of nature; and is then very beneficial. Salivation (a profuse discharge of saliva or spittle) is only a symptom of that disease to which it has given its name. The disease consists in an irritation, swelling, and inflammation of the glands of the mouth and throat; at times, of the whole mucous membrane, which, in health, secretes thc necessary saliva. It is evident and rational that, in order to stop the salivation, we must remove the inflammation of the gland, or mucous membrane, by the appropriate remedies; which, if done, will of itself reduce the discharge of saliva to its legitimate quantity. All astringents which will directly diminish salivation are injurious; being only harmless, when they produce no effect. Mild washes, or gargles, such as milk and water, may [Page 259](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/261) PARALYSIS OF TIl-E TRONqU E. 259 be used. with benefit. Depend, however, principally upon the followinog remedies TREATMENT. - If nercury or cclomel is and Sulp~hur, in alternation, every six or twelve hours a dose (four glob.), until the patient feels relieved, if not of the quantity of saliva discharged, at least of the illfeelings generally experienced in the whole system. If caused by cold, the first remedy to be used is almost always Ml]ercury; and if not better after twelve or twenty-four hours, give the above-named remedies in the same order. If salivation occurs in fevers, as a crisis, do not interrupt its flow, unless it becomes very weakening and dangerous, in which case use the above-named remedies. Beside, compare \"Stomacace.\" DIET AND REGIrMEN.- Diet of the mildest kind, gruels, milk and water, rusks, crackers soaked in milk, etc.; no neat. II. PARALYSIS OF THE TONGUE. Paralysis of the tongue is one of the symptoms by which apoplexy shows itself; and in that case can only be cured by the removal of the whole disease. See, in that case, \"Apoplexy.\" But where the disease has only palsied the tongiue and made it useless, give Lachesis, if it is experienced more on the left side of the tongue, and Belladonna, if more on the riiygt side. Beside, Cartslic, flyoscyamus, 1Opium, Stramonium, Aconite, Sulphuttr, in rotation, if necessary, one after the other, giving every two or three days a dose (four or six glob.), until improvement begins. DIET AND REGIMEN. - The usual homneopathic diet in chronic diseases. 12. DIFFICULTY OF SPEECH.-STAMMERING.-STUTTERING. A person may lose his speech in consequeneo of spasms or paralytic strokes, and if this is the case see their respective [Page 260](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/262) 26')0 AFFECTIONS OF TIHE TEETH, GUMS, AND MOUTH. it is the well-known stammering or stuttering, nmedticielies lmay be given to decrease tile general sensitiveness of tile nervous sysilemn, and plarlticulltarly of the nerves of speech. Yet the treatment nmust lie principally in acquiring such habits of speech as will bring it completely within the colltrol of the speaker; reading aloud is of service, iztonating every word, and beating time with thefingeers on anything near. if this is patiently persevered in for a length of time, it will overcome the disease. A kind treatment by parents and teachers is necessary, particularly where lessons are to be repeated, or messages received. For diminishing the general sensitiveness of the nervous system, give the following remedies, which will have, also, a specific bearing upon the local disorder. Lackesis, Belladonna, Miiercury, Sulphur, Stramonium, Nratrumr muriaticumn, Gra2hites. Give each for six weeks, every week one dose (six glob.), until better. DIET.-Abstain from coffee and spices. 13. 1R{ANULA, OR SWELLING UNDER THE TONGUE. This disease consists in a swelling of the salivary glands unlder the tongue, where it appears as a bluish eminence, not painful, but in its final growth impeding speech materially. The principal remedies are Thuja, lfiercury, Calcarea carb., and Sultphur; each remedy to be given for six weeks, every week two doses (six golob. each), until better. These remedies may be used at the same time externally, by dissolving a few globules in a little water, and keeping it in the mouth for a minute once a day. DIET AND REGIMEN. \u2014Abstain from coffee and spices. [Page 261](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/263) CHAPTER XII. AFFECTIONS OF THIE THROAT. faucium.) a, Common Sore Theroat. THIS well-known disease consists in an inflammation and swellino of the back part of the throat, palate, and tonsils, which impedes the respiration to a greater or less extent, and occasions fever. It appears in different degress of intensity, from the slightest irritation of the throat, vanishing quickly, to the highest degree, the formation of an abscess in the tonsils, or adjacent parts, which becomes very painful, and obstructs respiration to an alarming extent. The following list of medicines will exhibit the different degrees of intensity in the symptoms, according to which the remedy must be chosen. TREATMENT.- I will first remark here, that perhaps in no disease the beneficial effects of cold water are so evident as in sore throat; and advise, therefore, its use in the beginning of this complaint, if it is possible. In the evening, when going to bed, put a wet bandage around the throat, and cover it with a dry cloth; repeat the same in the day-time, if remaining within doors; and at the same time select the proper homceopathic remedies, as the application of the cold water will not interfere with the action of the medicine. I would also advise sponging the throat and breast with cold water, for persons who are habitually subject to quinsy, (261) [Page 262](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/264) 262 AFFECTIONS OF TITE THROAT. in order to strengthen the weak parts. This ought to be done regularly, every morning. Another precaution which such persons ought to take, is to avoid, as much as possible, long-continued or loud talking, particularly when the weather is inclement, damp and cold, producing colds and rheumatism, or when traveling in rail cars. They should also strictly avoid any irregularity in diet and habits, and take particular care not to overload the stomach. ADMINISTRATION OF THE FOLLOWING MEDICINES. -Remember that the patient always ceases taking any medicine, as soon as he feels better, or is, at least, not worse. In the latter case, take the last appropriate medicine at longer intervals, from time to time, until entirely relieved. Having selected a remedy, dissolve twelve globules of it in half a teacupful of water, and give according to the severity of the case; every one, two, three, or six hours a teaspoonful, until from three to six teaspoonfuls have been taken, when either the patient is better, or another remedy is needed; if the latter, prepare and give this one in the same manner as above. If the patient cannot swallow, let him keep the medicine for a minute on the tongue, and then spit it out again, as the effect by that time is fully there; or give the medicine dry on the tongue; in which case, do not repeat it as often, say every two, three, four, or six hours a dose (four glob.). Before giving the list of medicines and their symptoms, I will state that in the commencement of most cases of sore throat, CUhamomile, Bryonia, and Belladonna, in alternation, every four or six hours a dose, will be found sufficient, it taken early. If, however, the disease still progresses, select the more homoeopathic remedy from among the \u2014 QUINSY. 263 angina (sore throat) is caused by the abuse of mercury, look principally for Belladonna, Carbo vey., Hfepar, Lachesis, Lycopodium, Sulphtur. SYMPTOMATIC DETAIL. \u2014Aconite. Particularly if at the beginning the patient has much fever, heat, thirst, swallows with pain and difficulty; the throat inside exhibits deep redness, causing a pricking sensation, worse when speaking. N. B. In inflnimmatory affections of the throat, Aconite ought invariably to commence the treatment: after it a suitable remedy is Belladonna. When there are excoriating pains, with sensation of scraping and enlargement; generally a dryness in the mouth and throat; when swallowing, the pain shoots into the throat and utp to the ear; sometimes cannot swallow at all; the drink escapes through the nostrils; violent thirst, witch dread of drinekin g; the throat itself inside shows a bright redness without much swelling, or a deep intense redness with considerable swelling of the tonsils, palate, and glands, with tendency to the formation of abscess or ulceration. Sometimes much slimy, wvhitish mucus in the mouth and throat; swelling of the muscles and glands of the neck and nape of the neck, with violent fever; hot, red, and swollen face; red eyes, with dread of light. After it, lifercury, Hlepar, or Lachesis, will be suitable. Bryonia. Sensations of shooting, with dryness of the throat and difficulty of speech; after getting cold in damp cold weather, or after over-heating one's self, or drinking icewater; frequently with pains in liinbs and head, chilliness and thirst; in such cases, alternate with Rhus, every two or three hours a dose (four glob.), until three doses of each are taken, or until better. Rhus. In most cases, where Bryonia is indicated (see the preceding I' Bryonia \"), or where there is obstructed swallowing as from contsraction of the throat. Chamomile. Especially in sore throats of children, or [Page 264](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/266) 2 61 AFFECTIONS OF THE THROAT. where it; is caused by checked perspiration; the glands of the neck, under the chin, and the tonsils are swollen; in the throat itself a feeling of enlargement, with deep redness of the parts affected; inability to swallow solid food, especially when )lying down; tingling in the throat, with hacking cough, hoarseness and rough voice. If fever is present toward evening; heat and shivering alternate with redness (especially of one) Vf the cheekcs; irritability, with cries and tears; the child wishes to be constantly carried in the arms and wants things which, upon receiving, it throws angrily away. Lachesis. Swelling, redness, and feeling of excoriation of the tonsils and palate; constant need to swallow, with a sensation as of a tumor or lumjp requiring to be swallowed; swallowing is obstructed, particularly of liquids, which often escape through the nostrils; worse in the afternoon and morning, after sleeping, or from slight pressure on the neck. Sometimes it is necessary to give Lachesis after other remedies, particularly after Belladonna and Mercury have mitigated tlhe symptoms, but there still remains burning and dryness in the throat, extensive swelling, especially of the left tonsil, with difficulty of breathing, or danger of suffocation; or where there are small ulcers in the throat, or on the left tonsil; in which case, the remedy should be given in alternation with Lycopodium; particularly when the bowels are constipated, and on the tonsils in the throat appear very small yellow eminences or tubercles. (See \" Ignatia.\") Mercury. Suits firequently in the beginning of a sore throat, when caused by taking cold, and in addition to the throat symptoms, there is a rheumatic drawing pain in the head and nape of the neck; perspiration which affords no relief; the throat symptoms are, violent shooting in the tlroat, and tonsils, especially when swallowing, which extends to the ears and glands of the face and neck; or there is a burning in the throat, and pains as from excoriation, s welling and great inflamnzatory redness of the parts affected; elongation of [Page 265](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/267) SORE THROAT - QUINSY. 265 the palate, diflicult swallowing, especially of drinks, which escape through the nostrils. In this case- give it in alternation with Belladonna. If an abscess in the throat cannot be avoided, Mercury, in alternation with Lachesis and Hepar, are the principal remedies to promote its maturation, and even after it has broken, ]Mercury is necessary, with Hepar and Siizcea, to promote its healing; particularly when the patient feels worse at night, or in the evening, when he feels chilly and hot at the same time; much saliva in the mouth, with perspiration, which affords no relief; tongue thickly coated. Pulsatilla. Suits very frequently in females, or persons of a mild phlegmatic character; after having taken cold, and the throat feels swollen inside; tonsils and palate look dark and red, and dark red veins appear in the throat, which is covered with tough mucus; the patient feels chilly toward evening. Nitric acid. Is very suitable after Mercury has been given, or in alternation with it where the throat is filled with small, superficial ulcerations, of a whitish appearance, like thrush, with bad mercurial smell; also, in that form of angina caused by abuse of.Mercury (see this article). Carbo vea. Suits well after liercury and Nitric acid, if these remedies have not been sufficient against the ulcers in the throat; or after Bryonia and Rhus have been given, and there yet remain severe burning and pricking pains, particularly in wet weather. Ni.x vomlica. Suits very well after Chamomile, or in persons of a bilious choleric character, when they have a soreness in the throat, with a feeling of rawness, hoarseness, particularly when inhaling cool air, or during the swallowing of the saliva; or when the palate is elongated and swollen, with constipation and thirst. VEZx vomica is a principal remedy for ulcerated sore throat. (See the next article.) Ignatia. Sensation as of a plug in the throat, with shoot-' ings into the ear, especially when not swallowing; greater 23 [Page 266](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/268) 266 AFFECTIONS OF THE THROAT. difficulty in swallowing liquid than solid food; the tonsils swollen, indurated, or covered with where iVux vomica seemed to be indicated, or when there is a burning roughness in the throat, with feeling of contraction and stiffness, beside sneezing and running of the nose, also running of the eyes. In cases of this kind it relieves very quickly. IMepar. Often after Belladonna, Mercury, Lachesis, or when there are stitching pains in the throat, or in the swollen tonsils; particularly when swallozoing or coughing; violent pressure in the throat, with danger of suffocation; necessary in maturing abscesses. (See Mercury.) Siliceca. After an abscess has broken, Silicea, in alternation with Hepar, is recommended, until it has closed and healed. Sulphur.

See \"Inflammatory Fevers.\" EXTERNAL TREATMENT.-Nothing but gargling with warm water and milk; or for an abscess of the throat a warm linseed poultice, until it breais. Erysipelas of the Throat, as it appears mostly in scarlet fever, measles, small-pox, etc., sometimes, however, independent of these diseases, requires in preference, Bellad., the detailed symptoms may indicate. For angina caused by syphilis or gonorrhea, give mostly Mercury, Nvitric acid, Thuja, Lachesis, or Sulphur. If it arises from foreign substances in the throat, such as splinters, etc., give first Aconite, as usual; but if, notwith-. standing, swelling and heat make their appearance in the wounded part of the throat, look above, under \" Erysipelas of the Throat,\" for the principal medicines, which in such cases are preferred. [Page 267](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/269) ULCERATED AND PUTRID SORE THROAT. 267 For constitutional or clronic angina, where a person is liable to these attacks upon the slightest occasion, commence the cure by selecting from. Nitric acid, Niux take them as needed, but not oftener than once a day; and if the case is not too urgent, as far apart as every two or three days one dose (four or six glob.), until better. b. Ulcerated' and Putrid Sore Throat. (Malignant Quinsy.) (Angina Gangrenosa.) This is one of those dangerous diseases, the treatment of which will seldom be attempted by domestic practice alone; yet, as persons may be in circumstances where they could not procure the aid of a homceopathic physician, I will give below the symptoms and treatment of this disease, as plainly and fully as it can be done in a work of this kind. DIAGNOSIS.-This disease, in its most virulent form, appears mostly as an epidemic among children, when scarlet fever is raging, which it often supplants, or accompanies. In this form, it is highly infectious. In a milder form, it may occasionally attack any person, child or adult, who, from derangement of the digestive organs, or predisposition to throat diseases, is more subject to it. It commences with a chill or shivering, followed by fever; great languor and oppression, with or without nausea; eyes suffused, with a reddish hue; cheeks crimson; nostrils inflamed, with a thin acrid discharge, causing excoriation of the nose and lips; pulse weak and very quick, to indistinctness; beside, the patient is very restless. On examination, the palate and visible part of the throat are found to be of a bright redness and swollen; which together with the tonsils, are soon covered with numerous ulcers, coated with grayish-yellow crusts, which frequently separate in large pieces. At this time, the whole interior of the mouth, and even the lips, are involved in the destruction of the mucous [Page 268](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/270) 268 AFFECTIONS OF THE THROAT. membrane. The fever and restlessness increase, as also the difficulty of swallowing and breathing. The breath becomes extremely offensive; the glands around the neck swell, and the skin on the neck and face assumes a shining, glossy appearance; finally, drowsiness sets in, and the young patient, if not soon relieved, dies with symptoms of apoplexy or suffocation. The milder form exhibits the above symptoms, with less severity, and terminates, in most cases favorably, on the third or fifth day, by general perspiration; breathing then becomes easier; the pulse less frequent and stronger; quiet sleep ensues, and the expression of the face grows more lively. TREATMENT.-Tile typhoid character of this disease requires medicines for that class of fevers, such as Belladonna, Lachesis, Arsenic, Carbo veg., Sulphur; and the peculiar affections of the throat, such as Mercury, NVitric acid, Nux vom. Belladonna. In the beginning of the disease, when there is dryness of the throat and choking, fear, restlessness, even delirium. For further indications and ADMINISTRATION.-See \" Bellad.,\" under \"Scarlet Fever.\" Mercury. If profuse secretion of saliva makes its appearance, together with ulceration in the throat and mouth, which must be carefully observed, give Mercury either alone, in the same manner as Bellad., above referred to, or in alternation, with Nitlric acid, in the same manner, if there is great sensitiveness in the ulcerated parts. If these two remedies arrest the disease, causing diminution of saliva and a cleaner appearance of the ulcers, wait patiently twenty-four or thirty-six hours, at which time one dose (four glob.) of Sul9phur will be sufficient to complete the cure. But if the disease progresses, Lachesis will be necessary to be given, in the same manneras Bellad., above; particularly when the neck becomes much swollen and glossy, and the gangrene of the ulcers still continues. [Page 269](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/271) INFLAMMATION AND SWELLING OF THE TONSILS. 269 If no change is perceptible from its use within twelve hours, let it be followed by Arsenic; which is the principal remedy, particularly when the weakness is very great. These two remedies may be given in alternation, in the same manner, and, for at least twenty-four hours; if then not better, let 3Nux vomica and Carbo veg. follow in the same manner. If a drowsy sleepiness, with snoring, appears, give Opium, three times every hour a dose (each dose four glob.), and afterward Cuprum in the same manner; if the patient sleeps with eyes half open, give Bryon., and Hellebor., as directed under \" Scarlet Fever.\" After the patient is out of danger, but the ulcers do not heal fast enough, give Nitric acid, evening and morning a dose (four glob.), and in two or three days afterward, Sulphur, in the same manner. APPLICATION OF WATER.-See page 261. DIET AND REGIMEN.-Diet as in \"Scarlet Fever;\" cleanliness and free ventilation are strongly recommended. N. B. For the treatment of the milder form of this disease, see also the preceding article on \" Sore Throat or Quinsy.\" INFLAMMATION AND SWELLING OF THE TONSILS. (Anmygdalitis.) This disease, in its acute form, is already treated of in the article, \"Sore throat or Quinsy,\" to which we refer the reader. In the chronic form, where the tonsils have become enlarged and remain so, often for years without seriously endangering the life of the patient, it is extremely dangerous to have the tonsils cut out; as frequently, after such an operation, the lungs become affected, and the patient dies of consumption. The only safe way to cure these enlarged tonsils, is to put the patient under homceopathic treatment; and, even though it takes a long time (the nature of the disease does not admit of a speedy reduction), it is still better than to expose the patient's life to the greatest danger, by an operation. [Page 270](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/272) 270 AFFECTIONS OF TIHE THROAT. Commence such a course by giving the patient the following remedies, in their order; of each remedy every four days a dose (four glob.) for six weeks, until an amendment is WATER in this disease is beneficial in the form of wet bandages during the night, cold ablutions in the evening, and sitting-baths in the morning; beside plenty of exercise in the open air; no meat diet, but frequent drinking of cold water. DIET.-As usual in the homceopathic treatment for chronic diseases. SWELLING OR ELONGATION OF THE PALATE. (Falling of the Palate.) Some persons are troubled with this disease after the slightest cold or indigestion; it consists in an inflammation of the palate (uvula), which produces the feeling of falling by its elongation. If it continues long, it becomes very annoying, and the cause of a tickling in the throat and an irritating cough. The practice of cutting off the palate, in order to take away its inflammation, is certainly radical enough, but by no means rational, and always pernicious. TREATMENT.- IVUX vomica is the best remedy in all recent attacks; evening and morning a dose (six glob.). If not better in forty-eight hours, take Mercury, Bellad., CGalcarea carb., and Sulphur, one after the other, in the same manner, until better. APPLICATION OF WATER.-See preceding article. DIET. \u2014Avoid meat, coffee, and spices; gargle the throat with cold water, and externally apply cold water bandages. (See \"Sore Throat.\") [Page HOARSENESS. (Raucitas, Aphonia.) IF this complaint accompanies other diseases, such as measles, croup, influenza, etc., its treatment will be found in the respective articles; but if the hoarseness, which is an affection of the mucous membrane of the larynx, exists alone, or only combined with a cough, we will state its treatment here. Hoarseness differs in regard to time and degree. It is recent (acute), or of long standing (chronic); also, sometimes very slight, at others very severe, amounting even to a perfect aphonia, or loss of voice. Catarrhs or colds in the throat frequently manifest themselves only as hoarseness, and should be treated as follows. a.

Follows well after lMercury, Pulsatilla,.Bryonia, and Rhus, and is necessary in every obstinate case of hoarseness, particularly at the end of the cure. Bryonia, and Rhus. In alternation, every two or three hours a dose (four glob.), when there is soreness of the throat and chest; worse after talking, with chilliness; pains in the limbs and head; oppressed breathing, frequent sneezing, with discharges from the nose. After it.Mercury and Sulphur suit well. ADMINISTRATION. Take of the remedies indicated three doses (four glob. each) in twelve hours (every four hours one); then wait twelve hours, and if not better take the next chosen remedy in the same manner. APPLICATION OF WATER.-Wash breast and neck frequently with cold water, and gargle the throat with it. DIET.-NO meat or coffee; drink freely of cold water, and [Page 273](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/275) CHRONIC HOARSENESS. 273 use the cold-water bandages around the throat during the night. b. Ch6ronic Hoarseness. A hoarseness which has continued for some time is a symptom of the beginning of bronchitis, and ought to be attended to immediately. If it cannot be cured by the following remedies, a homceopathic physician must be consulted. Hepar sulph. If a person has been used to take large quantities of calomel or other mercurial preparations, he may commence the cure with Hepar, particularly if there is a cough, worse at night, on lying in bed, or when any part of the body gets cool. After or in alternation with Phosphorus. Carbo vey. Chronic hoarseness, worse after talking; in wet weathei'; in the evening and morning; also, measles. Sulphur.

ADMINIsTRATION.-Take of the remedy indicated twice a day one dose (four glob.) for two or three days, and then wait four or six days for its effect; if then not better, take the next chosen remedy in the same manner. APPLICATION OF WATER.-The wet bandage around the throat during the night, and a washing of the throat with cold water in the morning, followed by rubbing, are recommended; beside drinking plenty of cold water and frequent sponge-baths. DIET AND REGIMETN.-Very little meat; no coffee or other stimulating drink, but much cold water, and every night cold water bandages around the throat.

In no disease is hydropathic treatment of more benefit than in the beginning of bronchitis, which is most always prevented by it. Keep the feet warm, and do not converse much. 2. ULCERATION OF THE WINDPIPE, commonly called BRONCHITIS. (Ph]thisis larynyea.) This disease consists in a, chronic inflammation and final ulceration of the larynx or windpipe; it is, consequently, dangerous in its results, and ought to be treated by an experienced physician as soon as one can be procured. It manifests itself by the following symptoms: DIAGNosIS.-Pain in the windpipe; difficulty of breathing, and sometimes in swallowing; hoarseness more or less, with frequent attacks of severe coughing; expectoration of a very little mucus or matter, sometimes streaked with blood; finally hectic fever; chilliness; burning in the hands, soles of the feet, and cheeks; thirst during fever. TREATMENT. - Before a physician can be obtained corn. mence the cure with Aconite. If there is fever and pain in the throat. Spongia and Hepar sulph. In alternation, if with soreness in the throat there is difficulty of breathing; sometime wheezing. Lachesis. If there is a feeling in the throat as of something sticking in it, which cannot be removed by swallowing. Phospohor., Car. veg., Caust. See \" Chronic Hoarseness.\" ADMINISTRATION AND DIET. See \"Chronic Hoarseness.\" APPLICATION OF WATER.-See (Angina membranacea. Laryngitis Catarrhalis. ) Although these two diseases are very different in their nature, they are frequently confounded and thought to be the same, only different in degree. The real difference, however, is this: [Page 275](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/277) CROUP AND CROUPY COUGH. 275 spasmodic, inflammatory disease of the windpipe (larynx), and in fatal cases consists in the formation of a membrane, which closes up the windpipe. It occurs mostly in dry, cold weather, with sharp northern winds. Croupy cou/gh is a catarrhal inflammatory state of the windpipe, which may end, if not cured, in inflammation and congestion of the lungs. It occurs mostly in damp, wet, and cold weather. Each may precede or follow the other; but as the remedies are entirely different, it is necessary to know the symptoms which distinguish them from each other. In the real croup children are mostly attacked in the fore part of the night, without much previous ailment, after an apparently sound sleep; they are seized with sudden oppression for breath, which appears in hurried, difficult, and hoarse respiration, accompanied by spells of coughing, with a squeaking, shrill, and grating, or metallic sound. These attacks weaken the child, which is very restless, and in more or less agony during a spell of the cough, but after it generally sleeps sweetly, and without obstruction in breathing, at least the first evening. Not so in croupy cough, where the breathing is labored, and the cough hollow and hoarse, even during sleep. The child coughs without awaking, showing that no local pain distresses it. Croup belongs more to a northern climate; the farther north, the more intense the croup; while croupy cough seems to take its place in the more southern countries, where real croup seldom occurs, except during long-continued storms from the north. In severe cases of croup, the intermission of the disease on the second day, in the morning, is not sufficient to permit the child to sit up, even if cheerful, for play, which it does in croup of less intensity, where the hoarseness, cough, and fever abate in the morning, to such an extent as to render the young patient quite cheerful and playful; if, in such a case, the same, or even severer symptoms appear on the second [Page 276](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/278) 276 AFFECTIONS OF THE WINDPIPE AND CHEST. evening, do not be discouraged, but give the same medicine again which gave relief the night previous. The mildest attack of croup, or croupy cough, is apt to return for three nights, and parents ought to be particularly careful during the first three or four days not to allow their little croup patients to come outside the room, or near the windows, where they could inhale the cold air; keep a flannel around the neck, which must be removed gradually when the patient is convalescent, by tearing a small strip from it every evening. TREATMENT OF CRouP. \u2014Without going into elaborate details on the treatment of croup, which would only confuse the reader, I will state briefly that course which is pursued invariably at first in every case of croup, coming under the treatment of a homceopathic physician, generally with the greatest success, leaving only a few very severe cases to be treated with other remedies, to select which requires the experience and skill of a physician. The first remedy, under all circumstances, is Aconite, twelve globules dissolved in half a teacupful of water, to be given every fifteen minutes a teaspoonful until four teaspoonfuls are taken; then administer Spongia and Iep)ar, in alternation, each one prepared like Aconite, in separate cups, every half hour a teaspoonful until the child is better; when it sleeps do not disturb it to give the medicine; as soon as it is better give only every three or four hours a teaspoonful alternately. If the patient gets very bad, breathing very quick, and labored, with a constant rattling in the breast and drowsiness (coma) of the head, prepare and give Tcartar emret., and Phoslporus, in alternation, in the same manner as Sl)ongia and Repar, above. If not better in three hours, give Opitum twice, every half hour a dose (three glob.), and then Cuprum, in solution, as Aconite, above, and if this does not succeed in three hours, give Camphor and Cofea, in alternation for two [Page 277](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/279) INFLUENZA. 277 hours, prepared as above, and then Lachesis, in the same manner as Aconite above. TREATMENT OF CROUPY COUGH-Give first one dose (four glob.) of Aconite, and then in one hour afterward Chamomile, Bryonia and Bellad., alternately (four glob.), until better; if not in six hours give Ipecac and Bryonia. APPLICATION OF WATER. \u2014A Homceopathy possesses remedies, more reliable and sure to overcome this disease, than any heretofore used, we need not the full and complicated use of cold water, which the so-called Hydropathists recommend for its cure; we can, however, adopt part of their treatment, without disturbing the influence of our medicines, and this consists simply in applying the cold-water bandage around the throat. In very severe cases the dashing of cold water over the whole body has been applied with great success. DIET AND REGIMEN.-During the attack nothing but the mildest nourishment, such as arrow-root, farina, milk-andwater, and water alone, if there is great thirst. Warm foot and hand-baths are recommended, with this precaution, that the parts thus bathed should be covered with warmed flannels directly after the bath. 4. INFLUENZA. This disease appears mostly as an epidemic, sometimes, however, sporadic, and has, in addition to the symptoms of common cold in the head (see this article), chilliness, followed by flashes of heat, great debility and headache, which forces one to lie down; rheumatic pains in the whole system; painful and red eyes, with great sensibility to light and difficulty of breathing. TREATMENT.-If most of the above symptoms are present, give Arsenic. Every three hours a dose (four glob.), until three doses are taken; then discontinue for six hours, await [Page 278](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/280) 278 AFFECTIONS OF THIE WINDPIPE AND CHEST. ing its effect, and, if not better, give one of the following remedies, according to the symptoms: Campi/or. If the chilliness still continues, or there is great difficulty of breathing and failing of strength; let the patient either smell champhor or drop three drops of spirits of camphor in half a tumbler of water, and give every fifteen or thirty minutes a teaspoonful, until better. Mercury. Particularly in the commencement, when the head symptoms prevail, such as sneezing and running of the nose, with rheumatic pains in the head and body, red watery eyes, or when a loose cough, with profuse perspiration without relief, sets in; also, when there is a slimy diarrhea, with straining like dysentery. Give it in the same manner as.rsenic, above. This remedy is considered almost a specific in this disease. (Compare also, \"6 Materia Medica,\" at the end of the book.) Bryonia. In alternation with Aconite, every two or three hours a dose (four glob.), if inflammatory symptoms appear; fever; dry, hot skin, with a hard shaking cough, and stitches in the chest. Belladonna and Aconite, in the same manner, if the cough is dry and spasmodic, With severe headache and dryness in the mouth and throat. Hepar, if the cold was better, but is worse again, or when the patient had previously taken much calomel. EEuplrasia, when with a discharge of white mucus from the nose, the eyes are sore and run water profusely. Phosphorus and Tartar emet., in alternation, in the same manner, if the lungs feel oppressed, weak, and sore; and when coughing or breathing there is rattling in the chest. Causticcrum. If the feeling of excoriation -in the chest is prevailing, with a dry cough, so violent that the urine escapes involuntarily; give twice a day a dose (four glob.). Pulsatilla. After Mercury, or in alternation with it, every [Page 279](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/281) INFLUENZA - COUGH. 279 three or four hours a dose, if the cough is loose, and the nose discharges thick, yellow mucus; soreness of the chest in the morning, after expectoration; foul tongue; disagreeable or insipid taste in the mouth; no thirst. Silicea, in chronic catarrh, which returns frequently, when it is either running or causes obstruction. Sucdden suppression of the influenza sometimes produces headache, for which give Aconite, Pulsat., China; or.Dificulty of breathing, for which Ipecac., and Bryonia, are suitable, followed by a dose of Sulphur, if necessary. ADMINIsTRATIoN.-IEvery three or four days a dose (four glob.), until better or another remedy is necessary. (Consult also the article on \" Coughs.\" APPLICATION OF WATER. (See page 231.) DIET AND REGIMEN.-NO meat or coffee; for drink, water or lemonade, if there is no diarrhea; gruels and toast-water. Keep the face from the direct influence of the fire in the grate or stove; it is preferable to remain in bed, where a gentle warmth may be maintained. 5. COUGH. As cough is in most cases, only a symptom of some other disease, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, influenza, hoopingcough, consumption, etc., we must refer the reader to their respective chapters. Sometimes, however,, a cough appears isolated from any marked disease, and is either caused by cold (catarrhal coughz), or sympathy, or derangement of other organs (nervous, sp2asmodic, and gastric cough); so that we have to mention here their appropriate treatment. a. Ccatarrhal cou/qh, caused by a severe cold on the lungs, is, in the beginning of the day, llarsh and painful; afterward it becomes loose, with heavy expectoration, relieving the chest from pain and oppression. TREATMENT.-If such a cold is combined with pains in the [Page 280](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/282) 280 AF]ECTIONS OF THE WINDPIPE AND CHEST. head and limbs, chilliness, and thirst (commonly called bilious), give Bryonica, and Rhus tox., alternately, every two or three hours a dose (four glob.), until better, or until three doses of each are taken; then wait twelve or sixteen hours before the next remedy is taken, which will suit the remaining symptoms of the cough. (See \"Symptomatic detail.\") When the cough is spasmodic cough, caused by nervous irritation or excitement, either original, or transferred to the lungs from other organs; for instance, pain in the womb (neuralgia) may cease suddenly, and, by being transferred to the lungs, creates here the hysterical cough. (See article \"Hysteria,\" especially.) All the nervous coughs are dry; but they may affect the stomach, and cause vomiting or retching; sometimes spasms in the lungs may take place; fits of szffocation, which are generally of not so much danger as they appear to be. TREATMENT.-For Cough, caused other diseases, such as worms, cdentition (teething), dyspepsia; growing too fast causes in young persons such coughs. Look for these in their respective chapters. N. B. After having found the kind of cough in the above, select the best remedy from those designated for such kind of cough, comparing the symptoms.

ADMINISTRATION. - Of a remedy, having been carefully selected, dissolve twelve globules in half a teacupful of water, and let the patient take every two, three, or six hours a teaspoonful (children half a teaspoonful), until three or four doses have been taken; then wait from four to twelve hours, according to the severity of the case; and if not better, select and give the next best remedy in the same manner. This will suit for recent attacks. In coughs of a longer standing, give the remedy for two days, evening and morning a dose (four glob.); then discontinue two or three days; if then not better, take another remedy in the same manner. To very small children, give the medicine in globules altogether, if they cannot take it dissolved in water; one or two globules at a time is a dose for them. APPLICATION OF WATER. \u2014 If the cough is very dry and exhausting, put a warm water compress over the whole chest, renewing it from time to time, until the cough becomes looser and the patient relieved. If possible, let the patient drink plenty of cold water and wash his breast and neck frequently with it, rubbing- well afterward with a dry towel. DIET AND REGIMEN.-If the cough is accompanied by fever or biliousness, abstain from meat and butter; if not, these may be used: otherwise, keep the diet prescribed in chronic diseases. If persons are habitually liable to take cold, they ought to harden themselves against the changes in the atmo [Page 286](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/288) 286 AFF'ECTIONS OF THE WINDPI PE AND CHEST. sphere, by the systematic use of cold water, externally, and internally, as spoken of in the latter part of the book (see \"Hydropathy\"); persons, howeverl, with tubercular affections must not use it. Another great dietetic rule is, that persons liable to colds on the lungs ought to abstain from all spiritous liquors. The bathing of children in cold water, when they have cold on the lungs, may be suspended for the time (except when allowed by a physician especially); as in many cases it might not be admissible at all. A patient with a cough should not occupy a damp room, facing to the north; but a dry, airy chamber, exposed to the midday sun, and susceptible of easy ventilation and even temperature. If the cough at any time is very dry and painful, use, as a loosening drink, an infusion of the roots of althea and liquorice, in equal parts, as freely as the patient finds it necessary, cold or warm. In chronic coughs, where the expectoration is tinged with blood, no warm drinks are allowed. In fall and winter, until summer, a plaster of Burgundy pitch on the breast is recommended to those who have weak breasts; but, after taking it off in the summer, they must wash and rub the breast well. ITOOPING-COUGH. ( Tussis Convzlsi'va.) Although this disease does not bring the patient in immediate danger of life, as Croup and Scarlatina, yet its ravages, when reigning epidemically, have been frightful, and the destruction of life great, particularly by diseases consequent upon its attack. The old school of medicine has never been able to shorten its course, and is obliged to this day to palliate its paroxysms, while Homceopathy has proved to an evidence, in thousands of cases treated, that hooping-cough can be arrested in its progress, and the danger averted, which attends its presence in the system, by arousing the germs of, or laying the foundation to, other fatal diseases. [Page 287](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/289) HIOOPING-COUGH -TUSSIS CONVULSIVA. 287 We have preceded the article on hooping-cough with these few remarks on the merits of the two systems of practice, not in a boasting spirit, but in the hope to induce those of our lay readers, not Homoeopathists, to reflect well and seriously, before they reject a mode of treatment so salutary and efficient in relieving the immense suffering and. dangers, which an attack of hooping-cough brings over their little ones. It is our duty to advise and point to the means to be applied, and this we do sincerely, supported by the experience of hundreds of cases, thus safely treated; the duty of parents, however, is, not to be indifferent, or negligent, in choosing the best means to relieve their children in times of danger and suffering. DIAGNOSIS.- Hooping-cough generally commences with symptoms which do not reveal at once its true character; the child shows signs of a heavy cold, sneezes, has mattery, heavy eyes, runs at the nose, and has an irritating, painful cough, sometimes with feverishness and quick respiration. If these symptoms appear during an epidemic. when the hooping-cough is prevalent, it is almost certain that they are forerunners of an attack of hooping-cough, and the remedies to meet it must be chosen accordingly. This first or cctarrhalc stage of the disease lasts from three to eight or more days, during which time no hoop is heard, to indicate the spasmodic nature of the disease. Sometimes we meet in this stage with congestions to various organs, as the lungs and head, particularly when the children are taken with it during the period of teething, which, of course complicates and aggravates the attack. The s\"coc1d or spasinodic stage of the disease commences after the catarrhal and febrile symptoms have disappeared, and is recognized by the peculiar sound of the cough, called hooping, which is known well enough not to be mistaken The cough during this stage returns in paroxysms, which sometimes assume a periodical character, for instance, they are more frequent and it'i nse every alternate day; this, however, is not [Page 288](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/290) 288 AFFECTIONS OF THE WINDPIPE AND CHEST. always the case. The patients have, as it were, a presentiment of the attack, when coming, and anxious to have some object for support, frequently run to their parents or nurses, taking hold of their hands or clothes. The paroxysms last generally from three to ten minutes, and end mostly with vomiting of food or mucus; they are from the beginning to the middle of this stage, more intense and frequent than toward its end, when the cough loses by degrees, the metal, shrill sound, and harsh tightness; the vomiting ceases and the paroxysms grow shorter; what the children now expectorate is more compact and solid phlegm. This stage may last from seven to sixteen weeks. Hooping-cough, like measles or scarlatina, is an infectious disease, propagated by a contagion, which lodges in the mucous membrane of the wind-pipe (trachea), where it produces the peculiar affection described above. It can be communicated by the expectorated mucus, or even the breath and exhalations of the infected children; from this it is evident that if children shall be saved from the disease by isolating them from the diseased ones, it can only be done effectually by excluding all social intercourse whatever, and this not merely during the severest period of the hooping-cough, but for so long afterward, until the last vestige of the cough and expectoration has vanished. The hooping-cough generally manif6sts itself eight days after the exposure to infection; it commonly befalls an individual only once in his life-time, although frequent exceptions to this rule are extant. It is a singular fact, that vaccination during hooping-cough mitigates its paroxysms considerably. It often occurs, that this disease, if raging in great virulence, occasions serious disorders, by exciting those dispositions to disease, inherent almost, in every one, and known to physicians under the name of scrofulous and psoric diathesis. From this source may spring serious diseases of the lungs, Asthma and Consumption, caused by the presence of the hooping-cough. Croup and'inflammation 289 be its concomitants, induced by exposure and loss and derangement of the mental faculties, in consequence of the heavy pressure of the blood toward the brain; the over-exertion during coughing, frequently occasions rupture (hernia), and. protrusion of the anus (prolapsus ani). During severe paroxysms, blood will often be expelled from the mouth and nose; this is done frequently, even for weeks and months after the hooping-cough has disappeared, on the slightest occasions, such as cold or overheating. PREVENTION.-If Tooping-cough reigns epidemically, it is beneficial to give every child, likely to be attacked, a dose (four globules) of Su4phur, by which the attack will be rendered less severe, if not entirely prevented. Should, notwithstanding, the child exhibit the premonitory symptoms of the hooping-cough, as described previously in the first stage, it must be treated in accordance with the symptoms. These show in most cases a catarrhal character and require for their removal the administering the above remedies, give of the selected medicine four globules twice a day to the patient, and then wait twelve or twenty-four hours for its effect. DURATION.-If this disease is not treated at all, or only by alloptlthic medicines, its duration is left to its own natural limits, and not shortened in the least; in such cases, the first stage may last from three to eight, or even twenty-one days, and the second stage, from the beginning to its height, from five to six weeks; from thence to its total disappearance, the same length of time. Frequently, the cough reappears in those patients in the fall or winter, who had it in the preceding summer. But under the proper homceopathic treatment, its duration is very much shortened; sometimes the disease is cut off in its progress within five or six days. Very seldom has a 25 [Page 290](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/292) 290 AFFECTIONS OF THE WINDPIPE AND CHEST. person the hooping-cough twice in his lifetime, except as above stated. TREATMENT. \u2014-In the first stage, where the children apparently have a cold, select from those remedies recommended in the articles on \" Cough,\" and I\" Croupy Cough,\" by the use of which the cough frequently entirely disappears. These remedies are mostly Chaim., Bellad., Bryonia, Cctlc., etc. zAconite. If the cough does not cease in a few days, but becomes very dry and whistling; the child has fever and complains of a burning pain in the windpipe. Administer as in Croup, until better, or some of the following remedies are indicated. Dulcamara. If the cough is loose and moist, with copious expectoration of a thin mucus with hoarseness, apparently brought on by exposure to wet or dampness, evening and morning a dose (three or four glob.) for two days. Pulsatilla. In the same manner, if there is a loose cough with vomiting of mucus or food; also, a slimy diarrhea.

Give alternately every hour or two hours a dose (three glob.), until better. Tartar emetic and Phosphorus, in alternation, in the same manner, is frequently necessary in this period, if there is rattling in the lungs, short breathing, great debility, drowsiness, and thirst; also, retching, with diarrhea. Carbo veg., is the principal remedy, when the cough exhibits the first signs of hooping; particularly, when it is worse in the evening, the patient complaining at the same time of sore throat when swallowing; shooting pains in head and chest; especially useful, when the weather is damp and cold. Give it the same as Duldcamara, above. In the second stage, when the hooping or spasms during coughing have really commenced, the principal medicines ale: paroxysms become more violent, with real hooping, vomiting of food and mucus, without or with fever, which is characterized by chilliness, heat with thirst, hot perspiration in the night; the patient feels better when moving about. Veratrumn. After Drosera, or in alternation with it, for similar symptoms, only accompanied with great weakness; small and quick pulse; slow fever, with cold perspiration on the forehead; child is unable to hold up its head; miliary eruption (prickly heat) over the whole body; apathy and drowsiness, from weakness; child dislikes to move or speak. Cina. If the child, during the hooping-cough, exhibits symptoms of worms-as picking at the nose, sudden pains or gripings in the bowels, or itching at the anus \u2014or if it becomes sty during a paroxysm of cough, after which a gurling noise is sometimes heard, descending from the throat into the stomach. This remedy can be given in alternation with Me-rcury (see \" JMercury \"), if there is bleeding from the nose and mouth at the same time. Czuprum. If the paroxysms appear very often during twenty-four hours, rendering the little patients rigid and unconscioues; if with drowsiness and rattling of mucus in the chest between the paroxysms, in alternation with Tartar emetic (see \" Tartar emetic:\" compare, also, \" Congestion to the Head\"). This remedy is particularly useful, when convulsions appear instead of the cough, and cease when the paroxysms return; as if the paroxysm of the lungs had been temporarily transferred to the brain. (See \" Convulsions.\") Tartar emetic and Phosphorus. See page 290. Belladonna.

Sometimes in alternation with Hellebor., when Belladonna was insufficient, for similar symptoms; or when the paroxysms of suffocating cough appear more in the evening or at night; mostly, however, after eating or drinking, which is vomited up. lXercury. The principal remedy, when the child bleeds profusely at the nose and mouth when vomiting, with copious sweat at night, and great nervousness; also, if there are worm symptoms (see \" Cina\"). Sulphur. At any period, if the paroxysms are accompanied by vomiting, which will not yield to other remedies. fodium. If the patient pines away, or has a chronic, watery diarrhea, of lightish color.

When the child cries much after coughing, or coughs after crying (in alternation with Cinacc or H2epar). ADMINISTRATION.-Whenever no reference is given to other chapters, give the remedies as follows: Dissolve twelve globules in half a teacupful of water, and give for two days a teaspoonful, morning, noon, and night; then wait two or three days for the effect; if the cough is slightly improved, wait still longer; because the hooping-cough needs, beside the [Page 293](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/295) INTFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS PNEUMONIA. 293 right medicine, a little time, to disappear by deglees; but, if no better, give the next remedy, in the same manner. APPLICATION OF WATER.-The washing of the breast with cold water, and the frequent drinking of it, is strongly recommended. DIET AND REGIMEN.-In cases with fever, see the diet in Croupy Cough;\" where there is no fever, give the usual diet without coffee and spices. A great deal of fresh air is good for the young patients, if they'have no feverish symptoms. The same holds good in relation to their usual bathing, which must be discontinued, if fever is present. INFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS. (Pneumonia.) This disease generally commences with chills, followed by fever, with difficulty of breathing, and a short dry cough; pulse soft in the beginning, afterward hard, but always very quick; dull pains in the chest at every deep respiration, with great oppression; expectoration of a tough, lumpy mucus, afterward mixed with blood; the patient generally prefers to lie on his back; is not inclined to speak, or when speaking pauses after every articulation; is sometimes sullen, and wishes to be quiet; in some cases, the face turns to a bluish 2purple, with red cheeks; tongue dry, parched; great thirst; skin dry, hot. As soon as the skin becomes moist and natural, the oppression in breathing diminishes, and a thick mucus is coughed up abundantly; the danger is over, and the patient needs only good nursing and rest in bed during convalescence. If this is not the case, however, the inflammation runs either into the nervous or typhoid stage (see \"Typhoid Fever\"), or into hepatizattion of the lungs (the air-cells are filled with lymphatic matter); both very dangerous and critical situations for the patient. Causes of Pneumonia are, mostly, exposures to cold, north or northeast winds; particularly, when at the time one is over-excited by fast running, etc.; also, suppression of hemor [Page 294](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/296) 294 AFFECTIONS OF THE WINDPIPE AND CHEST. rhages or habitual secretions; inhalation of obnoxious gases; irritating treatment of catarrh (I have seen inflammation of the lungs follow the use of hoarhound candy, in a simple cold, and hooping-cough). Pneumonia appears in its highest inflammatory degree in the north, while toward the south it gradually decreases in violence, but not in danger; because here the bilious complication occurs more frequently (bilious pneumonia), where bleeding is particularly injurious. TREATMENT.-This disease requires quick and energetic action; and the first remedy to be given, under almost all circumstances, is Aconite. In the chill, as well as the highest fever, in the commencement (either alone, in water dissolved, twelve globules to half a teacupful ), every half hour a teaspoonful, until the fever is broken, and the pain and oppression in the chest are ameliorated; or in alternation with Bryonia, when oppression and pain in the chest are very severe (resembling pleurisy-see that article); worse by every movement or cough; expectoration bloody, of a brickdust color; also, pains in the extremities; tongue is coated, often dry, with great thirst; constipation. Administer the same as Aconite, only every hour or two hours a teaspoonful. If after these two most important remedies the disease still seems unchecked, give, in six or eight hours afterward, if not better, Phosphorus, in alternation with Tartar emetic, dissolved in water, the same as Aconite and Bryonia, every hour, or two hours, a teaspoonful, until three or four teaspoonfuls of each are talken; wait for the effect of these remedies, from eight to twelve hours, as frequently their effects are not seen immediately. If necessary, repeat both the above prescriptions, or choose among the following remedies, if the patient, in place of being better, has run into the typhoid or heplatized stage of the pneumonia. [Page 295](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/297) INFLAMMATION TiHE 295 Thle tyl/hoid stage of pneumonia commences when +he patient is restless, particularly at night; throws himself about and becomes quite delirious, or lies motionless on his back in a stupor; breathing quick and irregular; snoring with his eyes half closed, and rattling of mucus in his lungs; tongue dry, pulse quick and thread-like; skin dry, or covered with clammy sweat (See \"Typhus Fever\"). TREATME, NT. In the beginning of this state give China. Particularly if the patient, in the early part of the disease, under allopathic advice, had been bled, or lost blood by otheri means, such as hemorrhage, or a fall or blow (in the latter case, in alternation with Arnica); or when the patient complains mostly of a pressure in the chest, stitches in the breast and sides, together witl palpitation of the heart when breathing or coughing; beside, great weakness, fine, quick pulse and yellowish coated tonoue. Administer two or three times, every two or three hours a dose (four glob.); then wait from four to six hours, after which recourse may be had to Bryonia and BAus lox., as prescribed in \"Typhus Fever\" (see this article). If the disease still progresses, it will be necessary to give Opium (see this remedy in \"'Typhus Fever\"); or Arnica, under similar symptoms, but without delirium; or Ij yoscyacmtus (See \"Typhus Fever\"), if the spasmodic or very irritating. Belladonnsa (see \"Typhus Fever\"), when the oppression is very great. Tel'etrrun. If the pulse is very small and weak; extremities cold; delirium; vomiting and diarrhea; sinking; no sleep whatever. CaniphIor and C(ffea, in alternate doses, in a similar state, pa-rticularly if the patient is covered with cold perspiration. Phos/thoric acid. If after the patient has been relieved by [Page 296](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/298) 296 AFFECTIONS OF THE WINDPIPE AND CHEST. the above remedies, there is yet diarrhea present. (See \"Typhus Fever.\") Sulphfur may be given once or twice, if the amelioration brought about by previous remedies seems not to be permanent; then return to those medicines again, which previously were the most efficacious. Administration the same as in \" Typhus Fever.\" feJpatization, or the second stage in pneumonia, when infiltration of the lungs with coagulated lymph takes place, is indicated by greater difficulty of breathing, and a dull sound by percussion of those parts of the breast where the pain was the severest. TREATMENTX.-Sulphiur has first to be given (twelve glob. dissolved in half a teacupful of water, every two or three hours a teaspoonful) four times; then wait from eight to twelve hours, and, if not better, give Lachesis, Lycopodium, Phos~phorus, one after the other, in the same manner as Sulphur, until better. Arsenic and China, in alternation, in the same manner, when fetid expectoration, of a dirty, green color appears. APPLICATION OF WATER.-In the different stages of this disease relieves greatly and accelerates tlhe specific effect of the proper remedies. The wet bandage, frequently changed, is generally sufficient to afford relief in the inflammatory stage, mitigating the fever and preventing its return. During the typhoid stage or when hepatization has taken place, the wet sheet will accelerate the cure under the proper remedies. DIET AND REGIMEN.-As in fevers generally; but particularly as in \"Typhus.\" After-Diseases.-If pneumonia threatens to become charonic, or consumption ensues, see this article; when the Mifercury, Sulphi2ur, Stannum, Lachesis, IHepar, Lycopodium, are the principal be given, as stated in a\"Consumption.\" [Page 297](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/299) INFLAMMATION inzfcozts anld ckhildrene up to two or three years of alkeC is very frequent; in fact, every cold on their lungs aril'ls them more or less in an inflarnmmaitory manner, and oug'(hL not to be neglected for a mom-ent.

Pneumonia in Old People. (Pneumonia notha.) This disease shows itself in old people as follows: They become at once prostrated, having symptoms of a common cold, with a cough, chllills, and fever; the cough is loose, and the expectoration white, yellow, slimy, and streaked with blood; the respiration quick and labored; pain in the breast, when drawing' a long' breath, mostly on a small spot; fever is not hiigh; pulse soft but quick; cheeks slightly flushed; skin generally moist at nighlt, without relief; during the day, the patient feels tolerably comfortable; the voice, however, is weak, almost in a whisper. As these symptoms do not seem to indicate any danger, the disease is frequently left to itself, but very often with the most fatal results; because paralysis of the lungs soon ensues, and death is inevitable. TREATMENT.-Aconite. Every three hours a dose (six glob.) will be first necessary, three or four times, during the fever, after which give AMercury. In the same manner; wait twelve hours, and then, if not better, in alternation with Belladonna. Particularly when the cough becomes short and dry, and the breathing difficult and suffocating; if not better, give Sulpihur once or twice; afterward repeat Mercury and ]Belladonna. Veratrumn and Arsenic. If they sink very low; cold etc. (See \" Typhoid Pneumonia.\") Tartar emet. and Phosphorus. If, with constant rattling in the lungs, paralysis threatens; alternately every half hour a dose (three or four glob.).

DIET AND REGIMEN \u2014The same as in \"Pneumonia,\" only more nourishing' as soon as the inflammatory symptoms have left in the least; the yolk of an egg with sugar; broth of beef with rice, etc. After-diseases, see \" Consumption.\" There is another disease, called galloping consumption, in which the inflammation of the lungs forms the most important part. This species of pneumonia occurs mostly in young people of florid complexion, at the time of development, and needs a separate article. (See'\" Galloping Consumption.\") It is evident, from the nature of pneumonia and the dignity of the organ affected, that a good homceopathic physician ought to be consulted, if he can be procured; but if this cannot be done, rely on the above rules and prescriptions. REMARKS ON PNEUMONIA. This disease may frequently be complicated with other diseases, such as inflammation of the pleura, heart, and brain; also, with bilious, rheumatic, or gastric symptoms; the treatment, however, does not vary from the above; beside, consult the respective articles. PLEURISY. (Pleuritis.) muscularis.) a. Real Pleurisy. If the sac around the lungs (called pleura) becomes inflamed, we call it real pleurisy; this can be the case with or without inflammation of the lungs. If complicated with pneumonia or bronchitis, these articles must be consulted together with this chapter. DIAGNOSIS.-In real pleurisy the pain is preceded mostly by a chill and fever, as in pneumonia, but it does not produce [Page 300](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/302) 300 AFFECTIONS OF THE WINDPIPE AND CHEST. so much general oppression in breatlling as pneumonia; howevrr, in pleurisy the pain is more severe on a fixed spot (mostly in one of the sides of the chest), from which it radiates; increased often to intolerance by deep inspiration or Lard pressure between the ribs, where the pain is located; the breathingo is, on this account, short, and the lying on the afiected side impossible; if the back part of the pleura toward the spine is inflamed, the pains increase by moving thle spine, and running up into the neck impede frequently the swallowing of food, with inclination to vomit, or produce real vomiting. Fever is never wanting, but not so evident as in pneumonia; neither is the cough so distressing, but more a short and driy one, very seldom, with much expectoration of mucus. This disease terminates frequently in the formation of lymphatic effusion, which result may be known by the following, change of symptoms, different from the above real pleuritic ones: respiration becomes more anxious and short; the patient cannot now lie on the well side either, or, if he does, he feels in danger of suffocation, because the water presses over toward the well lung; by turning, which is very difficult, lie feels something moving within the chest, like water; the fever becomes hectic; the urine is offensive, and has a sediment. This description will be sufficient to distinguish pleurisy fiom pneumonia; but there is another form of pleurisy, the so-called b. False Pleurisy. (Stitch in the Side.) Whllich resembles the true or real pleurisy very much, yet is different in origin and location, as well as in termination. DIAGsNsIs.-This false or spurious pleurisy, is not an inflammatory, but a rheumatic affection of thle intercostal muscles, and occurs mostly in persons subject to rheumatism; it is preceded generally by pains in the -necl, shoulders, and [Page 301](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/303) PLEURISY \u2014 FALSE PLEURISY. 301 throat, as if firom cold, without much of a chill, fever, or thirst; the pain in the side is worse by exhaling; in real pleurisy, worse by inhaling; slight pressure on the affected side increases the pain in real pleurisy, while only hard pressure with the fingers between the ribs increases it in false pleurisy, which has a slight cough only; in real pleurisy the cough is dry and painful. TREATMENT. a. Of Real Pleurisy.-Aconite and Bryonia. First of all, in the same manner as described in \"Pneumonia,\" for so long a time as the pain is very intense; if not better in thirty-six or forty hours, give Sulphur. Twelve globules dissolved in half a teacupful of water, every two or three hours a teaspoonful, until four or six are taken, particularly if the fever continues with the painful oppression on the chest, yet the skin has become a little moist; this is the principal remedy, also, when effusion of plastic lymph is feared, or has taken place; it is well enough to give the patient even a dose (six glob.) of Sulphur, if Aconite or Bryonia, or both, have restored him so far as to be able to be out of bed. If Aconite ameliorates the pains, do not be in haste to give Bryonia immediately, but wait until the disease increases again; do the same in regard to Bryonia. In general, do not give another remedy as long as the former has shown a decided beneficial effect. If the patient is sleepless and restless at night, give at any time Coffea'C', and Belladonna\"c', in alternation, every hour a dose (four glob.), until better. If the patient complains of lying hard on his side, in consequence of which he changes his position often; has cola hands and feet, yet feels hot inwardly; or if a short, dry cough troubles him very much, particularly by increasing the stitching pain in his side, give Arnica once or twice, every two hours a dose (four glob.). If the real pleurisy is complicated with pneumonia (pleuro [Page 302](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/304) 302 AFFECTIONS OF THE WINDPIPE AND CHEST. pneumonia), give the remedies described under Sepia,* according to the symptoms indicating their use. N. 3. As these pleuro-pneumonias are frequently of a bilious character, the remedies for bilious or bilious rheumatic fever must be consulted. TREATMENT. b. Of False Pleurisy (Stitch in the side).-If there is any fever, give first once or twice a dose (four glob.) of Aconite, every hour and a half one dose; after which administer the principal remedy: Arnica. Every two hours a dose (six glob.), and in alternation with Apis mellifica or Pulsatilla. If the patient is not better in. two hours; but if he is relieved, scarcely anything more is needed, but rest and perspiration in bed. In two or three days afterward one dose of Sulphur (four glob.) may be given to complete the cure. _N'ux vomeica. Stitch in the side, with painful sensibility of the external parts of the chest;oen pressing between the ribs; worse on taking deep inspiration or d'any movement. If at any time the patient becomes feverish, with pains in limbs, side, and head, give Bryonia and tRhus tox. (See \"Rheumatic page AND REGIMEN.-AS in fever generally. In false pleurisy fiequently a mustard draught, or some other heating substance-for instance, a bag of heated salt-will relieve, and may be used with advantage. Sepia once cured an old man of a most violent attack of pleuropneumonia on the left side, caused by a Imetastasis of an inflammation of the liver, which had been subdued, but not cured, a few days previous, by excessive allopatbic blood-letting; China had preceded the Sepia, without decided effect. [Page 303](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/305) DISEASES OF TIHE HEART. 303 DISEASES OF THE HEART. a. k/lammationz of the /eart. ( Carditis.) It is well that inflammniation of the heart does not occur frequently, as its course is very rapid and dangerous, and its diagnosis difficult. DIAGNosIs.- The prominent symptoms are violent pains, mostly burning or cutting, in the region of the heart and toward the pit of the stomach; great oppression in breathing, which shows itself in the distorted and anxious features of the patient; the pulsation of the heart is violent and irregular, while the pulse on the wrist is small, frequent, and trembling; the patient prefers lying quietly on the back;, sometimes there is delirium, difficulty of swallowing, fainting spells, vomiting, starting in the sleep. CAusES.-This disease is caused mostly by taking cold in drinking' cold water when the body is heated; also, by wounds, blows, etc.; the most frequent cause, however, is acute rheumatism, particularly in the knees. See \" Rheumatism of the Heart.\" It must be well understood that not every palpitation of the heart is inflammation of the heart; the latter has always an agonizing feeling of oppression and pain. TREATMENT AND ADMINISTRATION.-In every case give first Aconite, as directed in \" Arsenic, Pulsatilla, and CEannahis sativa, at intervals of from two to four or six hours, until better; each remedy, when used, may be dissolved in water (twelve,lobules to half a teacupful), and every half hour a teaspoonful given; but, if possible, procure the advice of a homceopathic physician immecdiately. APPLICATION OF WATER. \u2014Wet compresses on the chest in the region of the heart will be beneficial, but they must be frequently changed; the water whichl the patient drinks may be very cold. If the pains are very severe, and the extremities become cold, a warm foot-bath may be applied. [Page 304](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/306) [304 AFFECTIONS OF AND CHEST. b. Pcdlpitcation of the:Ieart. ( Paclitatio cordis.) Young people in their growing years, as well as old persons of high age, are troubled with this disease; the former from development and congestion, the latter from contraction, ossification, and want of blood. Between these two extremes of age, persons sometimes are taken with it by violent emo. tion of the mind, by the use of ardent spirits, or by constitutional predisposition, particularly when inclined to be affected by rheumatism, which latter mostly causes the chronic palpitation of the hleart. In pregnancy this disease is frequent, as, also, in persons of a plethoric habit, and at the time of change of life, or during floodings, in consequence of loss of blood. If it is dependent on organic disorders of the heart, as polypus, ossification, etc.-as, also, in the chronic form \u2014we advise strongly to apply in time to a homceopathic physician, as fiequently a permanent cure may be effected. TREATMENT.-If caused by fright: Opium or Coffea. By disaplpointment: Aconite, Chamomile, Ignatia, Nux Lachesis, Aurum, debilitating losses: China, Phosphoric acid, i-ittux vomica, Veratrum. If it is present in persons, Arsenic, Lachesis, particularly when with temporary dimness of After the suppression of an eruption: Arsenic, Lachesis, SuGlphur. For palpitation [Page 305](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/307) RHEUMATISM OF THE HEART. 305 of the heart, the most suitable medicines are, Pulsat., Arsenic, Lachesis, Aconite, twelve globules in half a teacupful of water, and take from one to twelve hours a teaspoonful, according to the severity of the case; or, if traveling, take of the medicine a dose (four glob.) from one to six or twelve hours; if not better after fronm one to twelve hours, select another remedy. APPLICATION OF WXATER varies according to the character of this disease. If it is caused by plethora, cold bandages around the chest will be indicated, at the same time that the feet may be put in warm water. If caused by loss of blood or other debilitating influences, a cold ablution will invigorate the system and support the effect of the proper remedies. In almost all cases of palpitation of the heart, a lukewarm footbath in the evening will be found beneficial. DIET AND REGIMEN. \u2014Diet as usual in chronic diseases. \u2014 Sleep as quiet as possible during the administration of the medicine; be careful always to have dry, warm feet; avoid getting wet by exposure to rains, etc. Young people must abstain fiom eating much in the evening, but drink freely of cold water. c. Rheumatism of the H-eart. (Rheumatismus cordis.) DIAGNosIs. \u2014In this disease the palpitation of the heart is only one of the symptoms; the principal symptom is a sensation of weight in the region of the heart, with occasioirl stitches through it; beside, tearing pains in the external muscles of the chest and in those of the left upper-arm, either constantly or only periodically. With the palpitation of the heart and its violent action, the character of the pulse on the wrist does not harmonize; the latter is invariably weak, small, and contracted. CAUSES.-This disease appears mostly in young persons of both sexes at the age of development,, at which time it is 26 [Page 306](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/308) 306 AFFECTIONS OF THE WINDPIPE AND CHEST. dangerous; if neglected or badly treated, the heart will inflame or increase in size. It is also frequently caused by the translation of acute or inflamimatory rheumatism (see tlis article) to the heart; the treatment in this case remains the same; it is favorable, if the rheumatic symptoms reappear in the extremities. with great anguish, feverish heat, particularly in the face; the heart beats rapidly, while the pulse is slow and intermittent. Stitches and oppressive aching in the region of the heart, as if from a heavy load; the patient cannot breathe well in an erect position. Arnica. Stitches in the heart from the left to the right side, with fainting fits, quivering of the heart, with a pain as if it was squeezed together. Belladonna. Palpitation of the heart with intermitting pulse; great anguish about the heart; tremor of the heart with anguish and pain; oppression of the chest. (After Aconite, or before Lachesis.) Spigelia. Tumultuous pulsation of the heart with suffocative sensation and spasms of the chest, increasing in a sitting posture and bending the chest forward; tremulous motion of the heart. (In alternation with Pulsatilla.) Pulsatilla. Palpitation of the heart with great anguish, clouded sight and impeded respiration, particularly when lying on the left side; anxiety, pressure, and burning sensation in the heart. Bryonia. Respiration impeded by stitches in the chest with palpitation of the heart and violent oppression (after Aconite, where acute rheumatism of the extremities had been transferred to the heart). Arsenicurn. Violent palpitation of the heart with great anguish and restlessness; great heat and burning of the chest, [Page 307](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/309) CONG~ESTION OF THE CiTL:'ST. 307 with cold extremities; in suich cases, in alternation with V7ercatrum;~ or with Lachesis, wlhel pulse becomes plsation. ilrregular.

Apply to a homceopathic physician as soon as possible. CONGESTION OF THE CHEST. (2Plethora pectoris.) Congestion or determination of blood to the chest is a frequent complaint in young people, during the time of the development of their systems, and in persons of a phthisical habit. It ought never to be treated by bloodletting, even if this means relieves for the time, as it does not remove the disposition or the bad consequences, in the system, but has a tendency, if once resorted to for palliation, to augment the difficulties for a final cure, rendering the lungs weaker by each successive attack. The homoeopathic remedies, on the contrary, relieve in a different manner, and in a much shorter time. DIAGNosIS.- Great fullness, weight, and pressure in the chest; more or less palpitation of the heart, with oppression, short and sighing breathing; cold hands and feet, and anxious look; sometimes a hacking, short cough. TREATMENT. - Aconite.

(Hcemqptysis, Pneumorrhagia.) Spitting or coughing up of blood is generally considered by persons such a dangerous, and, for the life of the patient, fatal [Page 309](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/311) HEMORRHAGE OF THE LUNGS. 309 symrptom, that they lose, when it occurs, all presence of mind, frequently incapacitating them for the right action in the case; yet not all the hemorrhages of the lungs are alike in their character; some are dangerous, it is true, but most of them yield readily to the proper remedies, and some even cease of themselves. It will be necessary to distinguish well between them, and act accordingly, not in too great haste, but in the right manner; in this way, time is saved. Moreover, we will see hereafter that the most dangerous kinds of bleedings from the lungs leave ample time to provide means, while the milder forms take more by surprise, thereby causing more fear than injury, with the exception of one form, the so-called \"Apoplexy of the Lungs,\" which is easily distinguished by marked symptoms. Be careful to examine whether the blood coughed or hawked up is from the lungs, or merely fiom the nose or palate. DIAGNOSIS. \u2014 Without going into the distinction as to the different places in the lungs and windpipe from whence the blood may issue, as this would be without practical advantage, we will give now the qualitative difference of hlemoptysis, which has the highest practical bearing. We distinguish two varieties: 1. The active or idiopathic hzemoptysis, caused by congestion of the lungs, or mechanical injury; this is the most frequent and least dangerous. 2. The passive or symptomatic hbomoptysis, caused by the ulcerative process in consumption, which gradually consumes the substance of the lungs (if not arrested), and causes the rupture of larger blood-vessels; although this is the most dangerous form, as it is caused by a destructive and sometimes incurable disease, yet it does not occur frequently, and even then its appearance may be expected and measures taken accordingly. First. Active hemnorrhage of tle lungs depends always on congestion of blood to the lungs, which is sometimes consti [Page 310](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/312) 310 AFFECTIONS OF THE WINDPIPE AND CHEST. tutional, at other times caused by external circumstances, such as quick running, violent exercise of any kind, lifting, etc., the frequent inhaling of injurious dust, such as from lime, gypsum, or plaster of Paris, tobacco, flour, or metal filings, or of obnoxious gases, such as from nitric and. sulphuric acid. Beside these causes, it sometimes appears epidemically, mostly at the time of the equinoxes, on account of the rapid changes in the temlperature of the atmosphere; the abuse of spiritous liquors is a frequent cause of hemorrhage of the lungs; also, suppression of discharges of blood from other organs, as stoppage of the menses, sudden disappearance of the piles, etc.; excessive growing and consequent weakness of the chest predisposes to it, as in general young or middleaged persons are more liable to it. It occurs in attacks, accompanied with more or less fever, frequently of an intermittent type, worse toward night. This form of hemorrhage of the lungs presents itself in the most various degrees, from the least spitting of blood to a violent effusion; the highest degree, which really endangers life immediately, is the ap)o2lectic hemorrhage (apoplexia pulmon.) of the lungs, where all the symptoms of an apoplectic fit are present; the patient loses his consciousness, looks as if he was suffocated, eyes protrude out of their sockets, bloody mucus issues from the mouth. TREATMENT.- The first tliing necessary in severe cases is to let the patient keep as quiet as possible, in a half-sitting, half-lying posture; he must remain perfectly quiet, without speaking or being spoken to, except when it is indispensably necessary; if no homceopathic medicine is at hand, give every five or ten minutes a teaspoonful of table-salt in water, but cautiously, that it may not make him cougTh; or, if suzl2huiric acid is convenient to be had, drop five or ten drops ij.to a tumbler full of water, and give a teaspoonful every five or ten minutes, until the severest bleeding ceases. If homcopathic medicine is at hand, give directly, [Page 311](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/313) HEMORRIAGE OF THE LUNGS. 311 Aconite. Twelve globules dissolved in half a teacupful of water, every ten or twenty minutes a teaspoonful, until the severest bleeding ceases; afterward administer it at longer intervals, from three to six hours. This remedy suits always at first, but particularly when there is ebullition of blood in the chest, with a fullness and a burning pain; palpitation of the heart; anxious looks, with paleness of the face; profuse expectoration of blood at intervals, provoked by a slight cough. Try this remedy at least for two hours; if not bettelr, give Ipecac. When there yet remains a taste of blood in the mouth; friequent, short cough; expectoration weakness; or, Arsenic. When there is yet palpitation of the heart, with (great anguish, dry heat, and desire to leave the bed; it is particularly applicable for drunkards after HEyoscyamun s has been given. Opi,)um. Often in the most serious cases, especially in persons addicted to spiritous liquors; or when there is expectoration of thick, frothy blood; cough worse after swallowing; oppression and anguish; weak voice, drowsiness and anxious starts; cold extremities, and heat in the chest. NYzux vomicac. Suits well after Op)iuqm, Ifjccac., or Arsenic; particularly when there is cough, affectino the head, caused by tickling in the chest; or when the hemorrhagTe was caused by a fit of passion, by taking cold, or suppression cf piles. Sulphur suits well after it. CZhina. If the patient has already lost nuch blood; or when the cougoh is violent, hollow, dry, and painful, with taste of blood in the mouth; shivering and flushes of heat; weakness, faintness, cloudiness of sight, roaring in the head. ]Ferrumr. After China, if this has in severe cases relieved, yet there is goreat fatigue after talking; slight cough, with expectoration of scanty, bright red blood, with pain between the shoulder-blades; difficulty of breathing. [Page 312](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/314) 312 AFFECTIONS OF THE WINDPIPE AND CHEST. Hyoscycamus. Dry cough at night, with expectoration of blood; frequent waking with a start; particularly in drunkards, after Opium and NVux vomica, and followed by Arsenic.,Dulcamara. Tickling cough, from cold; the hemorrhage was preceded for some time by a loose cough. Carbo veg. Hemorrhage, with violent burning pain in the chest, in persons susceptible to changes of weather, or who have taken much calomel. Pulsatilla. In obstinate cases, when black and coagulated blood is expectorated, more in the morning or night, particularly in timid persons, or in females when caused by suppression of the menses. Arnica. In slight hemorrhages of black and coagulated blood, with stitching, burning pains and heat in the chest, palpitation of the heart, difficulty of breathing; or caused by mechanical injuries, fall, blow, lifting, leaning against a table by studying, sewing; or when the expectoration is clear, frothy, mixed with pure lumps of matter; hacking cough, from tickling under the breast-bone; pains in the limbs, as if they had been beaten. It is often administered in alternation with Aconite. Belladonna. Cough from tickling in the throat, with hemorrhacge; sensation of fullness, as if from blood in the chest, with pressing or shooting pains, worse when moving; is especially suitable for hemorrhages of the lungs in females of' full habit, at the change of life, and then in alternation with Aconite. In very serious cases, Aconite, China, Ipecac., and Opium will be found most efficacious. For the bad consequences of pulmonary hemorrhage, such as weakness, coulgh, etc., give Carbo veg. and China. If possible, procure the advice of a physician immediately. ADMINISTRATION of the above remedies, in very severe cases, the same as in Aconite, stated above; in less severe cases, or mere spitting of blood, give every six or twelve hours a dose [Page 313](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/315) ASTIMA. 313 (four glob.) until better, or until another remedy is necessarly. APPLICATION OF WATER in the form of wet compresses on the chest is recommended; sometimes a cold foot-bath will be necessary, the feet being rubbed constantly while in the bath. DIET AND REGIMEN. \u2014The patient must be kept cool; his drinks, for two weeks, at least, must be cool, not spiritous or excitingc, but more slimy, such as rice and barley water, water with raspberry syrup, lemonade, etc. If the feet are cold, put them in warm water, mixed with ashes or mustard. In apo1plectic hemorrhage of the lungs, give Aconite immediately, same as above; if not better in twenty or thirty minutes, Opiumn and tlhen Ipecac.; afterward, if necessary, Belladonna or Lachesis, in the same manner. Put the feet in hot water, with mustard; also the hands, if they are cold. Send immediately for medical aid. Second. Passive hemorrhage of the lungs, or rupture of a blood-vessel in tubercular consumption, requires principally Aconite, C]hina, Pulsatilla, Arsenic, Lycopodium, to be given in the samle manner as described under active hemorrhage. See, also, \" Pulmonary Consumption.\" DIET AND REGIMEN the same as above. ASTHMA. As this disease is well known in regard to its symptoms, we will only mention here that distinction in its character which has a practical bearing. There are two kinds of asthma, as regards the cough and expectoration of mucus in an attack; it is either a dry or humid. The former is more sudden and violent in its attacks; has only slight cough and expectoration, but great difficulty of breathing. The attack of the latter, or humid asthma, proceeds slowly \u2014has a severe cough, with gradually increasing and afterward copious expectoration of mucus, which relieves greatly. Asthma in itself, is not a dangerous, but a very distressing disease, sometimes heredi27 [Page 314](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/316) 314 oftener acquired; its different causes will be enu merated below, with their respective remedies attached. Inl general it is curable, although it takes a comparatively longer time than most other chronic diseases require, particularly when it is constitutional. A radical cure must only be undertaken by a skillful homceopathic physician. We subjoin below the treatment for the attack itself, to alleviate temporarily, advising the patient, at the same time, not to omit any favorable opportunity by which he may be allowed to place himself under the care of a physician, for the final cure of the disease. TREATMENT.-When caused by congestion of blood to the chest Ipecac., Arsenic, Sulph. When dry, or without much expectoration of mucus: Ipecac., Arsenic, China, Pulsat., SulJph. In the above tabular view, we have arranged the different kinds of asthma, as regards their origin and appearance; so that, in search for a remedy, the number of remedies to be looked for is reduced to very few. Their distinguishing symptoms are given in detail below, and their administration at the end of the article. The principal and first remedy in most all attacks is Ipecac., after the administration of which one may proceed with more calmness to find out the next best remedy, by comparing carefully its symptoms with those of the case present. SYMPTOXMATIC DETAIL.-i2Iecac. Difficulty of breathing; nocturnal paroxysms of suffocation, spasmodic constriction of the throat, rattling in the chest, from an accumulation of mucus; short, dry cough, great ancguish, cries, agitation, fear of death; alternately either redness and heat, or paleness, coldness, and ghastliness of the face; sometimes nausea, with cold perspiration on the forehead; breathing at the same time anxiously and rapidly, with moaning and rattling. After it follows well.Arsenic, Bryonia, or lApis mellifica. Arsenic. In all cases of acute or chronic asthma, with an accumulation of thick phlegm; difficult breathing after a meal; oppression of the chest and want of breath, rendered almost intolerable by any motion, such as walking, going up stairs, laughlling, etc.; constriction of the chest and throat; sufocatinyfits, more at night; panting, wheezing, as if dying Iwith cold perspiration; these paroxysms grow lighter on the appearance of a cough, with expectoration of mucus, or of viscid saliva; the attacks render the patient very weak; burning pain in the chest. Suits well after Ipecac., and before Sulphur, or 2Apis mellifica. i5aTx vomica. Asthma, resembling that of Arsenic, only the spasmodic constriction is felt worse in the lovwer part of' he chest, where even loose clothes seem to be too tight; short, dry [Page 316](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/318) 316 AFFECTIONS OF THE WINDPIPE AND CHEST. cough, sometimes with a little blood; congestion of the chest (see this article); asthma, better by lying on the back; occasionally turning, or sitting up; suits well for persons addicted to the use of spiritous liquors, or after Arsenic, or before Suplhur. Pulsatilla. Asthma in children, after suppression of a miliary eruption; in weak, timid females, after cessation of menstruation, or after having taken cold; choking, as from the vapors of Sullphur; paroxysm of suffocation, with deadly anguish, pallpitation of the heart, and spasmodic constriction of the throat or chest; worse at night, or when lying horizontally, or when moving; better in the open air; expectoration, with mnuch mucus, streaked with blood, which sometimes is coagulated; with a feeling of fullness and pressure of the chest. Chtna. Under similar symptoms as Pulsatilla, after which it suits well, if there is, with the asthma, great weakness, and easy perspiration in sleep. Sambucus. Asthma, similar to China, but more in childlen (see \"Asthma in children\"); when there is much perspiration; suits well after Ipecac. Sulzphur. Almost in any acute or chronic attack of asthma, if several other remedies were insufficient. After Sulhphur, if necessary, select carefully another remedy.

ADMINISTRATION.-Dissolve twelve glob. of the selected remedy in half a teacupful of water, and give, in severe cases, every half hour; in less severe cases, every two or three hours, and in chronic cases, twice a day a teaspoonful, until three or four are given. If better, discontinue until the symptoms are worse again; if not better, prepare and give the next remedy in the same manner. In very small children, give one or two glob. of the medicine at the same intervals, dry, on the tongue. APPLICATION OF WATER.-The wet bandage around breast and abdomen during the night will be beneficial; to prevent [Page 319](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/321) DROPSY IN TItE CIIEST. 319 an attlack the patient must wash frequently in cold water, and exercise afterward in the open air; constipation is relieved by cold injections and drilnking freely of cold water. D1E'T A D }REGIMEN. \u2014Persons suffering from chronic asthma, ouglht to abstain friom coffee, meat, and greasy substances almost altogether, and live mostly on farinaceous diet, such as gruels, etc. Sometimes, in very severe attacks, the burning of a piece of paper, soaked in a solution of saltpeter, and filling the chamber of the patient with its smoke, will relieve; or smoking tobacco, or gympsum-weed (stramoniumn). Asthmlra \" Children-Diseases.\" DROPSY IN THE CHIEST. (flydrothorax.) This disease appears mostly in consequence of previous diseases, either acute or chronic, and is too dangerous in its course and results to be managed by domestic treatment alone. Skillful medical aid is indispensable; yet we will briefly notice its symptoms, and some few remedies which mitigate its immediate distresses. DrAGNosIs. \u2014We distinguish an acute and chronic dropsy of the chlest; the principal distinguishing feature of both kinds is, the difficulty of breathing', when moving, particularly going up stairs, or lying' with thle head low; swelling of the feet in thle evening, and of the eyelids in the morning' thirst for water, yet scanty urine. The acule drolpsy of the chest occurs mostly in young people after eruptive fevers, such as scarlet fever, measles (see these diseases), or after the suppression of other eruptions by salves, ointments, etc. The chronic droqpsy of the chest occurs mostly in old age, or in persons addicted to the habitual use of ardent spirits. TRF.AET.ENT-.-To alleviate the difficulty of breathing, and render thil patient more comfortable, give Arsenic (twelve [Page 320](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/322) 320 AFFECTIONS OF TIIE WINDPIPE AND CHEST. glob. dissolved in half a teacupful of water), every hour a teaspoonful, until the judicious advice of a homnceopathic physician can Digit., in decoction, and Aspar. are strongly recommended. APPLICATION OF WATER.-The wet sheet, with its consequent perspiration, will support the action of the proper remedies very much. PULMONARY CONSUMPTION. (Pitl/isis Pubnlonalis.) We distinguish several forms of this disease, the most frightful destroyer of human life and happiness; but, as its treatment would be too complicated for a work of this kind, we would advise our readers to apply, in time, to a hom1 eopathic physician; as consumption, in its beginning, is in most cases curable. DIAGOSIS. -- If some of the following symptoms appear, we advise to seek medical aid: constant hacking cough, either dry, or with an expectoration of a frothy mucus; shortness of breath, pain in the chest, derangement of the stomach, hectic fever, chilliness followed by flashes of lheat, burning in the hands and soles of the feet, night-sweats; circumscribed redness of the cheeks during the fever, but pale cheeks at other times. The so-called tubercular consumption consists in the softening of the small tubercles, which are in the lungs frequently for years, without disturbing health, when they remain in their compact state; their softening, however, produces irritation and ulceration of the lunogs. In the beo-inning, this process can be repressed, and the patient saved. The galloping consumption is peculia-i' to y oung persons, ill qheir growing years, or after debilitating diseases, and requiles the most careful attention of a physician. It is very rapid, and is rightly called galloFin/; as it is most acute, sometimes even infectious, on that account. Aconite, Hyoscyatnms, are remedies, frequently useful in this species of consumption, to [Page 321](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/323) CONTUSION OF TtIE CIIEST BY A FALL OR BLOW. 321 allay the hlith fever and restlessness, and particularly for the'dry, slhor t, ouh ald of ealkness the niihlit. Under scroiJlozts constunption, we understand an ulceration of the lungs, caused by the transfer of scrofulous affections from other parts of the system, such as swellings of thle glands of the neck, etc., and all other more specific diseases, such as syphilis, cancer, etc.; also, when eruptive fevers fall with their fatal decision on the lungs, and there produce ulceration. APPLICATION OF WATER in this disease is to be made very cautiously and ought not to be instituted except under the advice of a conmpetent pllysician; in tlhe so-called tubercular consumnption the use of water is not beneficial; and as it is very difficult, for laymen to decide between the different forms of consumption, we must advise them not to trust their own judgment but seek proper medical advice at once. As this subject is so extensive and important to all, we refer our readers to a separate work, entitled'\" Consumption treated homceopathically,\" by A. C. Becker, M. D. CONTusION OF THE CtIEST BY A FALL O1R BLOW. When the chlest, externally or internally, is injiured by a fall or blow, apply tincture of Arnica externally, as dlirected under \"'lSprcoins,\" and internally give Aconide, and Arnica, alternately, in solution, as dilrected under \"'IHeorrhage of the Lungs,\" until the patient is better; if, after two or three days, tlhe fever still continues, widil an ulcerative pain in the chest, give.Plsatillca; and in,alternation witll lerczury, if there is a heavy, thick, yellow mucus expectorated; the latter remedy, hlowever, in exchangne with C5ina, if nighllt-sweats occur, and dera.noenlent of the stomach, bad appetite still continues, witlh sleeplessness and fever.

MOST diseases, particularly those of the bowels and those of an inflammatory character, produce loss of appetite, which, in such cases, is more beneficial than otherwise; as it prevents the sufferinog system from being burdened with nourishmnnt, at a time when the orgoans for its digestion and use are out of order. This applies to most of the acute, and to a great many of the chronic diseases. When these have disappeared by the use of proper remedies, the appetite returns of itself. But sometimes persons complain of loss of appetite without any apparent cause; in which case, it mostly proceeds from a derangoement of the nerves of the stomach. For such patients, it is of no permanent advantage to use stimulating drinks or food, such as bitters, mustard, or coffee. These things only create an artificial appetite, never removing the cause of the disease. The best remedy, which is applicable in almost all cases of loss of appetite, is cold uater, externally in ablutions and bathing, and internally freely drank at any time in the day and evenin; in large quantities, before, during, and afteir meals, etc., with the precaution, not to be overheated at the time. Beside this (lietetic remedy, as it were, the followin(g remedies are recommended: to be used according to directions given in \"Dyspepsia.\"- (Bidimy.) A morbid, craving, or voracious appetite, manifests itself in consequence of another disease present in the system, such as worm affections, dyspepsia, etc.; or it frequently is the necessary result of severe loss of strength, aftel violent, debilitating diseases. In every case it consists in a weakness and derangement of the nerves of the stomach, and is treated in the respective diseases of which it is generally a concomitant symptom. We will here only indicate some of these affections, with the remedies attached, which arrangement will be particularly useful. For their application and administration, see the respective chapters of these diseases. If there exists a craving for food in Worm aftections: violent diseases, or loss of fluids: China, Veratnrum. Dyspepsia, where unnatural an unnatural appetite, care ought to be taken not to overload the stomach. Frequent, but moderate meals, are preferable. 3. DYSPEPSIA, OR WEAK STOMACH. DIAGNosIs.-Dyspepsia is generally characterized by weakness of digestion, with loss of appetite, slight or irregular appetite, painful and disordered stomach, flatulency, sour risings, ill humor, drowsiness after a meal, sometimes vomiting of acid, or mucus, secreted in great quantities in the digestive organs. CAUSES.-The causes of this disease are as numerous as the symptoms vary, under which it shows itself in different [Page 324](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/326) 9324i AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACEI AND DOWELS. constitutions and periods of life. A principal cause lies in the irregullarity of the diet: eating too much, too rich, or too indigestible food; using stimulating dlinks, tea., coffee, liquors, to an excess, and at an unreasonable time; eatino' too quickly, o02 fasting too long between meals; studyino or laboringo mentally too intensely, or after a full meal; this is particularly the case in our country, where merchants are in the habit of confining themselves to their arduous business too closely after full dinners, when a few hours' complete rest, bodily and mentally, would be of the greatest benefit to them; lastly the imnmoderate use of tobacco, especially in the way of clhewing,' the use of such deleterious medicines as calomel, etc., by which weak stomach, or dyspepsia, is produced. REATMIENT.-Avoidingc the above-named causes of this disease is the first indispensable requisite in its successful cure; at the same time, the following' remedies will be of the greatest benefit, to be applied according to the symptoms. The priincipal remedies for recent dyspepsia are f3ux vome., and Pi]dsatilla; for chronic dyspepsia, IJe[)rp, Calcarea, Suzl]phur. (See their symptoms below.) To facilitate the choice of the remedies, -we classify the disease accordincg to its appearance and causes, with thle remedies attached to each kind; before selecting' a remedy, consult its details below. If dyspepsia is present in childlrenz: I:mecac., B3ryonia, Calcarcea, iA tx study: Nux vomica, Sulphur, Lachesis, Pulsat., Calcarea. By debilitating Sta physag. By as grief, anger, etc.: Chamomile, N5ix vom., Phosphoric acid, China, Stcaphysag. By mechanical injuries, blow, the stomach, etc.: Ar, nica, Bryonia, Rthus tox., Sulphur.

In very sevele and inveterate cases it is necessary to resort to an hydropathic institution, where the patient can receive the proper treatmrent, 28 [Page 330](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/332) 330 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMIACH AND BOWELS. DETr AND REGIMIEN.-Beside avoiding those excesses in the diet and regimen which we have mentioned in the \"IDiagnosis,\" as so many causes of this disease, it must borne in mind that every thing even allowed under other circumstances must not be indulged in, as soon as it disagrees with the patient. Keep busy and cheerful; avoid fatigue and exposure: the application of cold water, in a systematical way, externally and internally, is highly recommended. (See \"Hydropathy.\"). Exercise freely in the open air; travel and mingle in cheerful society. On this subject Dr. Gatchell very pertinently remarks: \"Dyspepsia means simply indigestion, and may be produced by whatever disorders of any one or more of the various organs which contribute to the preparation of the food. It may therefore have its origin in stomach, duodenum, pancreas, or liver. Though such is the mutual dependence of these various organs, that no one can become greatly diseased without injuring the vigor of the others. But in order to understand digestive disease, it is necessary that we should first examine digestive health. The food then, consists principally of three classes, which may be represented, one by starch, a second by oil, and a third by fibrine. Starch is found in vegetables; oil, in vegetable oils and the fAt of animals; and fibrine in the lean meat of aninals and in the juices and seeds of vegetables, especially the bread-stuffs. In order to easy digestion, it is necessary that the food should be minutely divided, which purpose is served by mastication. In addition to this, it is important to deglutition, if dry, that it should be mixed with the saliva. But the saliva has a more important use, that is to commence the digestion of the starch. It has, however, no influence on the oil or fibrine. These descend into the stomach with no other preparation than what mastication has afforded. Here the gastric juice begins to perform its part. This, however, is a limited one, since its solvent power is exerted only upon the class to which fibrine [Page 331](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/333) DYSPEPSIA OlR AWEAK StlOIMACTI, 331 belongs, which includes only fibrine, albumen, such as the white of an egg, casein, such as the curd of milk, and by a little extension, gelatine, such as animal jelly. It has no effect upon the oil or starch. These, therefore, except the very slight change commenced in the starch by the saliva, pass out of the stomach entirely undigested. But as the nutriment of the active organs and tissues is derived almost exclusively from the albuminous class, the gastric digestion is of the highest moment to health, and demands a more careful examlination. We find, then, that immediately upon the introduction of the food into the healthy stomach, two striking phenomena directly begin to manifest themselves. One is secretion, and the other motion. At the same moment that the gastric juice begins to pour into the previously empty stomach, the muscular coat of the stomach begins to propel the food from left to right and back again from right, to left, until it is thoroughly saturated with and dissolved by the juice. Accordingly, whatever prevents the proper action of the muscles, or diminishes unduly the quantity or vitiates the quality of the gastric juice, necessarily impairs digestion. In addition to the gastric juice, the stomach, firom its inner coat, which is a mucous membrane, secretes a mild mucus to lubricate its walls. The quality of this also may be vitiated, and thus interfere with digestion. But supposing the functions of the stomach to be duly performed, the albuminous aliment passes out quite digested, and reduced to a homogeneous mass, while the fat and the starch, except the slight change induced in the latter by the saliva, pass out entirely undigested. In the duodenzm, or second stomach, the whole mass comes in contact first with the juices from small glands similar to the small glands of the mouth, and afterward with the juice of the pancreas, an organ similar to the salivary glands, and also with the bile from the liver. By means of the juice from the small glands and the pancreas, the digestion of the starch [Page 332](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/334) 332 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOM3ACH AND BOIWELS. is completed, so that it is reduced to a sweetish mass. And thait of the f'at is ac:oompiished so that it is reduced to a soapy emulsion. Andcl now the bile begins to operate upon the entire ml1ass, p.;vcntin-g f-crrmentatioon; ith the formation of gas, and also cifeeting a separation of the mass into three parts. T'he fatty po'rtion appearing as a creamy pelicle, the albuminous and sugary as limpid fluid, and the indigestible material as a reddish brown sediment, tinged with the coloring matter of the bile. And now the little villous points which project from the mucous membrane of the small bowel begin to take up the aliment, giving up the fatty part to the lacteal vessels to be by them conveyed to the thoracic duct which ascends along the spine, that by this duct it may be emptied into the great horizontal vein on the left side of the neck. But with a nice organic instinct they surrender the sugar and albuminous parts to the veins, to be by them carried to the liver, that having received a final elaboration there, they may pass into the great vein which ascends to the heart along the right side of the spine. It will be readily perceived, that if the small glands of the duodenum or its mucous lining in general are diseased-if the pancreas secretes a juice defective in quality or quantity-if the liver pours out deteriorated bile, or, what is more important, fails to elaborate properly the great mass of the aliment which passes through it on its way to the blood-vessels, indigestion is the result. In order to keep this complex system in health, a due regulation of all the forces which impress it is essential. And not least important are the mental forces. Thus grief will at once arrest the action of the stomach, anxiety will gradually depress it, and a fit of passion will produce a sudden flow of bile, not only into its proper receptacle, the duodenum, but backward into the stomach, where it is apt to produce nausea and vomiting. One of the most important hygienic measures for the [Page 333](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/335) DYSPEPSIA OR WEAK STOMACHI. 333 healthy man and hygiastic for the diseased, is to preserve a chclefui and placid mind. Many persons hasten or aggravate dyspepsia by keeping their thoughts on the stomach. Now, it is a general rule, that all the involuntary and unconscious operations are disordered by sending the will or consciousness into them, and much more are depressed when these influences are combinlcd with any depressing emotions. We should endeavor, then, at meal-times, to be as cheerful as possible, and to engage in animated but not exciting conversation, and a host who can make us laugh good-humoredly, is both providing food and aiding us to digest it. I say that the conversation, though animated, should not be exciting, for it is another law of the system that intense action in one part tends to diminish vigor in other parts. - If, therefore, the brain labors at meal-times strength is withdrawn from the stomach and digestion is impaired. This fact is important, not merely while eating, but for some time after, even until the food enters the duodenum. Although it is probable that as it passes further from the stomach, it becomes more and more removed from mental influences. But it is a good method for a considerable period after eating to walk leisurely and to talk cheerfully. It is time gained and many a student ruins health by untimely rather than by protracted study, by permitting his brain to interfere with his stomach. Not less important than regimen during and after eating is the period between meals. Children can eat frequently with advantage, adults more seldom. I am convinced that among the sedentary inhabitants of towns and cities, the third meal is generally injurious. A hard biscuit and a glass of water to the early riser with a late breakfast, a dinner about the middle of the afternoon, and a supperless night are far preferable to the three-meal-a-day system. The stomach may be ruined by small quantities frequently eaten, even though the aggregate may not be excessive. Noon, too, is a bad hour for the student and the dyspeptic [Page 334](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/336) 334 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACII AND BOWELS. to cat. The noon meal is very apt to produce that digestive fever which attends a settled dyspepsia in the one and precedes it in the other. This fever is not so likely to follow a three o'clock dinner. I have said that supper is a bad meal. The student should fear it and the dyspeptic utterly avoid it. They may have a faint, empty feeling from going to bed supperless-so does the toper from going to bed damless. Thllis feeling only arises from weakness of the stomach, and is merely palliated, not cured by eating. Perseverance, regimen, and medication, if necessary, will cure it. I do not mean to say that every case of dyspepsia can be cured. Like all other diseases incurable cases occur. If there exists organic disease of the stomach, and more especially organic disease of the liver, then is patience much needed in the subject who suffers, and skill in the physician who medicates. Nor can water be too highly prized in this disease, especially if there exists a chronic inflammation of the stomach or liver. In either case the wet compress should be worn, if possible, night and day. Nor are dashes and showers without their use. The wet compress should be changed as often as it becomes either dry or affected by the secretions from the surface. The wet sheet is useful in all forms of dyspepsia, and is indispensable if the disease is produced by drugging, as the most obstinate cases frequently are. These are deplorable cases where a constitutional tendency to indigestion has encountered the tender mercies of ao drug-doctor, and, most horrible of all, where Herculean Calomel has assailed the digestive forces. Without patience and perseverance such cases are hopeless. In the milder forms of dyspepsia and in the severer, if too great tenderness does not exist, pretty vigorous manipulations may also be advantageously employed. Let the region of the stomach be forcibly grasped and pressed upon with the knead.. ing movement. which I recommend in constipation. Let the fingers also be pressed up under the ribs of the left side. The tendency of these movements is at the same time to promote L ^.............,., t.D S.....,..

It is meeting the disease in its stronghold, it is attacking the very fortress. Nor have these manipulations less value if directed to the region of the liver upon the right side. The secretion of the bile is thus promoted, as well as its discharge from its storchouse-the gill-bladder; and the circulation of the immense mass of blood which moves through the liver, laden with the products of digestion, is also materially aided. Nor arc smart taps upon the ribs over the liver and stomach without their use.\" 4. WATER-BRASH. HEART-BURN. (Pyr'osis.) (Indigestion.

This is particularly recommended to pregnant women, who frequently suffer from acidity of the stomach from constitutional causes. ADMINISTRATION, APPLICATION OF WATER, DIET AND REGIMEN, the same as in \"Dyspepsia.\" 5. BILIOUSNESS. GASTRIC DERANGEMENT. Biliousness, or bilious complaints, as a popular term, comprises different disorders of the digestive organs, which mostly have nothing to do with the bile or liver, but with the stomach alone. For practical purposes we divide these diseases: Into gastric affections, where the stomach alone is implicated; and, Into gastric bilious afrections, where the derangement of the liver reflects its morbid consequences on the stomach. These attacks occur without much fever. 1. Gastric cfEections (gastroataxic). This is a general name for all those disorders of the stomach, which we have already treated in the articles on \"Dyspepsia,\" \"Indigestion,\" \"Heartburn,\" I\"Water-brash,\" and \"Flatulency,\" to which we refer the reader. 2. Gastric bilious affections (gastrodynia biliosa). This disease is characterized by an oppression and swelling in the pit of th.e stomach, with inclination to vomit, and eructation of wind, of an offensive smell, like rotten eggs or meat; no appetite, and particularly a dislike for meat; thirst great, especially for acids; tongue thickly yellowish coated; either constipation or looseness of the bowels, of dark (black) offensive operations, with a great deal of wind. With these really bilious symptoms are combined a yellowish color in the face, around the nose and mouth; headache in the evening, with a full pulse and a feeling of heat without much fever. CAusEs.-Persons removing from the north to the south 29 [Page 338](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/340) 338 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND) BOWELS. are subject to t!his disease very often, whichl sometimes runs into bilious fever. Otherwise, it is caused more by the imprudent use of too much meat and alcoholic drinks in warm climates; also, by mental derangement, such as anger, grief, etc. It is, frequently, the forerunner of bilious fever. TREATMENT.-Similar to 1\" Bilious Remittent Fever,\" in its early stage. See page 159. Bryonia and Rhus alternately, every two hours a dose (four glob.) for two or three days, will generally cure biliousness. APPLICATION OF WATER.-See page 163. DIET AND REGIMENT.-Oatmeal gruel, with sugar and lemon-juice; lemonade, in small but often-repeated quantities; oranges; dry or milk toast; cold water. Meat, mneatsoups, and eggs, are strictly forbidden.'When recovering, a few oysters are allowed. If the bowels are very loose, the acids must not be used too freely; cautiously; if at all. NAUSEA. VOMITING. Nausea and vomiting seldom occur as solitary symptoms, except when caused by errors in the diet; in which case, the ejection of the noxious substances by vomiting is most beneficial, and ought rather to be fostered, by drinking freely of lukewarm water, than checked by medicine. But when nausea or vomiting is caused by, or connected with, other diseases, their respective chapters must be consulted; where, generally, these two, as prominent symptoms, are mentioned and prescribed for. We will, however, furnish the reader here with a list of the most frequent diseases in which nausea and vomiting exist, and attach the principal medicines thereto. The principal remedies, useful in most cases of nausea and vomiting, time can be had, to select with care the proper lhomceopathic remedy in a case of vomiting, it is of no disadvantage, to give at once: Ipecacuanha, if the tongue is clear; or Antimonium crud., if the tongue is much coated, white or yellow. Then proceed calmly to study the patient's case and select the proper remedy from the following symptoms. If nausea and vomiting is present: Lachesis, Sulp~hur. In consequence of carriage, sailing, etc., Cocculus, Petroleum, Arsenic, Ferrum, Arnica, internally and externally (See \"External Injuries.\") In connection with a cough: See \" Hooping-Cough.\" In connection with headache: See \"Sick AFFECTIONS GF TIIE STOMAC11 AND BOWELS. Or, in regard to ejected substances, If blood is \" Cessation of Menses,\" and \"Hemorrhoids\"). Generally, medical aid is immediately required, when blood is vomited. If the blood is very dark, Black vomit (melaena), with discharge of similar blood by the Arsenic, China, Ipecac. \"Constipation,\" and \"Ileus.\") If bile is vomited, (See \"Water-Brash,\" etc.) ADMINISTRATION. - Give the medicine either dry, every hour or two hours, from three to six glob.; or, dissolved in water (twelve glob. in half a teacupful), every half hour a teaspoonful, until better, or until three or four doses of a medicine are taken, when another remedy must be selected, if the patient is not better. APPLICATION OF WATER.-See the different diseases, of which nausea and vomiting are symptoms; beside, if it is desirable to have the stomach emptied of its contents, as in the case of an overloaded stomach, poisoning, etc., let the patient drink lukewarm water until this object is accomplished. If tile vomiting or nausea is disconnected from other diseases, the action of the proper remedies will be supported by the use of the wet bandage and the sitting-baths; in case of attending constipation, by cold injections and drinking of cold water; habitual coldness of the feet is regulated by cold foot-baths. [Page 341](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/343) SEA-SICKNESS. 341 DIET ANnD REG-IMEN. - In feverish attacks, see \"Fever.\" In all others, see their respective chapters. SEA-SICKNESS. This distressing complaint depends greatly on constitutional peculiarities, to which the remedy must be adapt'ed. As the cause (the motion of the vessel) continues, it is necessary to repeat the medicine frequently. It will be of service to be careful in the diet just before embarkation; especially to avoid rich, fat food. TREATMENT. \u2014The principal remedies are: Cocculus. In giddiness, headache, nausea; the feels better -when lying down..IVx vomica. lThe same. Tilhe patient feels better when not in the open air. PVulsatilla. The patient feels better in the open air, on deck. Colchicum. After Pulsatilla, or when the smell of food or the scent of the vessel sickens. Iyoscyamus.-This is the principal remedy to be taken first, every twenty or thirty minutes, a dose (four glob.); seasickness proceeds from a dizziness of head; this removed, the nausea will disappear. Petroleum. In cases of great debility. Arsenic. If the patient becomes very weak, and there is violent retching. Ipecac. If there is frequent vomiting, without feeling weak. For constipation, during a voyage on sea, give Ofpium, Cocculus, fIf-x vomica, Lachesis, Sullphur. When constipation is a putrid t-aste and bloody gums, give Staphysag. When patients are constipated, and have a longing for acids and something piquant, give Sepia. N. B. It is well enough to provide one's-self, on sea voyages, with Scotch ale and herrings; also, lemons; as those things are mostly desired by sea-sick patients. [Page 342](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/344) 342 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND BOWELS. APPLICATIOhN OF WATER is beneficial in this disease; a wet bandage around the stomach, drinking of cold water, and in case of constipation, the use of cold injections and the sittingbath are generally sufficient to accelerate the cure by the proper remedies. ADMINISTRATION. - The same as in \"Nausea and Vomiting.\" It is beneficial to take as much exercise on deck as possible, whatever the weather may be, although the patient may not incline to do so at first. SPASMS, AND PAIN IN THE STOMACH. ( (ardialgia, Gastralgia, ilTeuralgia of the Stomach.) DIAGNOSIS. - Spasmodic pains and contractions in the pit of the stomach, sometimes slight, sometimes of insupportable violence, and spreading to the chest and back, exciting nausea and vomiting; anguish; coldness of the extremities, and even faintness; belching up of wind often relieves the patient for a time, as, also, vomiting of an acid, limpid fluid, if acidity of stomach or a gouty disposition was connected with it. CAUSES. \u2014Any derangement of the nerves of the stomach, either sympathetic, from diseases of the liver, spleen, or pancreas, or more directly from long fasting, the habitual use of ardent spirits, indigestible food (new bread, nuts, sweetmeats, chestnuts, cherries, figs, cheese, etc.), coffee or tea, may cause this disease; especially if, in addition to this, the person exposes himself to cold, damp weather, or if he is of a gouty disposition, which then developes itself on the stomach in this form (rheumatism and gout of the stomach). Females are particularly liable to this disease, which, in them, appears mostly with derangement of the menses, especially after their cessation (neuralgia of the stomach), when it is sometimes associated with fits of fainting, and may end in vomiting of blood. In such cases, the periodical appearance of the disease is frequently observed. TREATMENT.-Persons liable to spasms of the stomach must avoid everything which could cause them directly, as L~~~~~~_~__ [Page 343](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/345) SPASMS AND PAIN IN TI-E STOMACIL 343 mentioned above. Beside this, they should keep their feet warm, and Nwear a woolen shirt or bandage, or in obstinate chronic cases, a Burgundy pitch plaster on thle stomach. Above all, however, we recommend to apply to a homoeopath0ic physician, who, in most cases, is able to eradicate the complaint. For recent cases, or in the attack itself, the following' rem.edies will be found beneficial. If a person is liable to attacks of this kind, he must be particularly careful in the diet; he must strictly avoid all crude, uncooked vegetable substances, such as salads; also, new made bread, sweetmeats, cherries, nuts, olives and chestnuts; cheese must be avoided, also all kinds of stimulants, tea, coffee, wine, brandies, beer; the use of cold water externally and internally is recommended. We give, first, a tabular view, to facilitate the choice of the proper remedy. Spasm inz the stomach (gastralgia), from Abuse of Colocynth, 5Lxz vom., Staphysag. Bryon., R]?us tos., Ccarbo veg.

If.Aitx vomica does not give any relief, Chamomile or Cocculus alternated, every half hour, if necessary, will be of great benefit. The pains requiring VC.Nux vomica especially, are: contracting, pressing, and spasmodic, with sensation of retraction or clawing in the stomach, with oppression of the chest, as if it were compressed by a band, with pain extending into the back and loins; nauseous accumulation of water in the mouth, or vomiting of sour liquid or food during' the pain, worse after a meal, from using coffee and arclent spirits,; fonom over-study, creating thereby constipation, piles, hypochondria, with irascible humor, hasty and passionate character.

[Page 347](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/349) GRIPING COLIC-STOMACIH-ACHE. 347 When the pains are not so severe, give the medicine at longer intervals; say, from one to two, three, or six hours, until amelioration takes place. In real chronic cases of this disease, give the chosen remedy only evening and morning a dose (four glob.), for two days, and then wait the same length of time, before another remedy is givenr; if better during that time, no more medicine is necessary. APPLICATION OF WATER in the form of wet bandages around the stomach, and the use of the sitting-bath, will accelerate the cure; if the feet are habitually cold, apply the cold footbath every evening. DIET AND REGIMEN.-The same as in \" Biliousness,\" and \"_Gastric Derangement.\" If no cold water is applied externally, a mustard plaster, or other heating substances, such as scorched flour, heated bran in small sacks, may be laid on the stomach. The patient is advised to remain as quiet as possible during the paroxysms. GRIPING COLIC. ( Colica; enteralgia.) more or less violent; griping, pinching, tearing, or burning, mostly in the region of the navel, yet often spread all over the bowels; severe cases of colic are accompanied by anxiety and cold sweat; stools either loose or confined; when the colic pain is seated in one place of the abdomen for a length of time without moving, danger of inflammation of the intestines ensues, which is indicated by the pain, hitherto griping and pinching, becomingl burning, and fever appearing (see \"Inflammation of the Intestines \"); vomiting of sour, bilious phlegm, or distension of the abdomen, painful to the touch, often attend the severest cases of colic. CAusES.-These are constitutional or acquired by circumstances; the latter are very many, such as colds, indigestion, worms, constipation, mental emotions, and occupations which [Page 348](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/350) 348 AFFECTIONS OF TIHE STOMACH AND BOWELS. rectuire persons to work in deleterious metals, such as lead, etc. According to these exciting causes, the three principal varieties of colic are: 1. Bilious colic, with bilious vomiting, severe griping, or slhooting or twisting pain in 4the abdomen at first relieved by pressure, afterward tender to the touch, with painful distension, cold extremities, restlessness, yellowish cast of the skin and eyes, the face expressing great annguish. 2. Flatulent or wind-colic, withl friequent belching up of wind, with or without relief; swelling of the abdomen, which is distended and painful in different places, as the wind accumulates and moves in different parts of the intestines; the pains come in paroxysms, and are sometimes very severe. 3. Painter's or lead colic, which commences sometimes before an attack with general lassitude, wandering pains in the bowels and extremities, heaviness in the lower limbs, clilliness, and depression of spirits; the attack itself exhibits the same symptoms as bilious colic, except there is not often vomiting of bile, but great pain and restlessness, during which the patient bends forwvard, pressing firmly against the abdomen, Lis extremities feeling cold, and his pulse being slmall and suppressed. TREATMENT. \u2014 The first thing to be done in any colic, if it is at all severe, is the application of a general warm bath, during which the patient, sitting in a tub, the warm water reaching up to the pit of the stomach, is covered with blankets to colffine the hot steam closely around hlim; after ten miiintes, lie ascends firom the bath and lays down with the ) blankets, without beingl dlied off, and is, covered with sufficient clotlles; the warmth tlhen nmay be kept up by putting hea-lted blricks or hot water flask-s around tlte patient, on the spots whlere lie complains tle most; a proffuse perspiration will ensue, which relieves the cramp and makes the paltieilt feel easier at once; it must be lept up until every vestige of pain:ha.s left for some time. The medicines t:o be prescribed [Page 349](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/351) GRIPING COLIC \u2014STOM;ACII-ACitIE. 349 below may be given, however, from the commencement of the pain, and continued until relief is obtained. We will now give in a tabular view the principal kinds of colic, with their remedies, the symptomatic details of which may be consulted below. a.

In colic [Page 356](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/358) .35 6 AFEZCTIONS OF THE STO'ACHI AND BOWELS. from indigestion, a cup of black coffee immediately taken is strongly reconmmiended. CONGESTION AND STAGNATION OF BLOOD IN TiHE ABDOMEN. That process, by which disease is generated and grows, depends upon certain laws, which in no case appear in more constant regularity, than in producing the different kinds of congestions. The three great divisions of the body-head, breast, and abdomen-are, at certain periods of man's life, successively, the places for congestions and stagnation. Thus the head inclines to be congested in childhood, the breast in youth, up to thirty or thirty five years (hence, in this period most all lung-diseases occur), and, finally, the abdomen in middle age, from thirty five to old age (hence in this period so many bowel-diseases, such as hypochondria, piles, dyspepsia, etc., take place). One of the most natural causes for these diseases is the determination of blood to the abdomen. We must not increase, by our mode of living, this natural tendency to congestion; as, if neglected or mistreated, its cure will be very difficult. DIAGNOSIS.-Persons troubled with this disease have a sensation of heat and burning in the stomach, together with the feeling of heaviness, hardness, and tension in the lower part of the abdomen. TREATMENT.-~UtX vomica and Sullphur, are the principal remedies. _itx vomica. Especially for persons who lead a sedentary life, are constipated, have pains in the loins, hips, and back, as if broken and very weak; hardness and tension of the abdomen; cannot bear the pressure of the clothing around the waist. Sul2phlr. After NVux vomica has relieved partially, in all cases, even the most obstinate, where constipation, hypochondriacal and hemorrhoidal symptoms are present; Vux vorm., alternately with Sulphur, every or a dose [Page 357](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/359) INFLAMMIATION OF' THE DIAPHRAGM. 357 (foul to six glob.), until four doses of each are taken, will generally be sufficient to relieve; if not, repeat it after an interval of from eight to fourteen days, during which time no medicine must be taken. Arsenic and Carho vey. Administered in the same manner, if there is great weakness, with tendency to diarrhea and flatulency. Cazpsicum. If the evacuations are soft, trifling, slimy, watery, give twice or three times a dose (four glob.), until better. Other remedies, to be used successively, but slowly, are: Pulsatilla, the wet bandage around the abdomen are beneficial auxiliaries in the treatment of this disease; beside the drinkinog of cold water. DIET AND REGIMEN. \u2014Exercise on foot and horseback, regularity of all habits and cheerfulness of mind are necessary. DIET. -See \" Piles.\" INFLAMMATION OF THE DIAPHRAGM. (Diaphragmitis.) This disease resembles pleurisy very much; sharp, shooting pains under the short-ribs; worse on pressing between or below the ribs, on sneezing, or coughiing, inhaling, or striking the body; relieved by bending the body forward; frequently there is hiccough present. CAusEs. \u2014The same as in pleurisy. We have only to add, that external injuries, such as blows, falls on the ribs directly, or a jarring of the diaphragm by a jump on the heels and feet, or (as in little children it is often the case) a twisting or unnatural turning of the body, are the most frequent causes of this disease. TREATMENT. \u2014The same as in \"Pleurisy.\" The STOMACHI AND BOWELS. Chamogmile. This latter. particularly in infants and children, when they are swollen around the short-ribs, where the slightest touch can not be borne without screaming or stoppage of breath (see, in \"Diseases of Children,\" \"Livergrown\"). Chelidon., when C/Eamnomiie seems to be insufficient, and there is extreme constipation, and then alternately with iVux v0oo. If caused by external injuries, Arwicca, externally, in solution, and internally, in alternation with Acooite, every hour or two hours a dose (six glob.) must be used until better. APPLICATION OF WATER.. \u2014Wet bandaces around the breast and stomach. We may be allowed to insert here a case in point, showing conclusively how important sometimes it is to make use of water as an auxiliary remedial agent. Miss O.. eighteen years of age, of full habit and bilious nervous constitution, was attacked in the hottest days of July, with severe pains in the epigastric region, which prevented her from breathing freely, and from turning on either side; she had to lay perfectly quiet on her back, without being alble to move, in order to avoid the most agonizing pain in the region of the diaphragm, which appeared swollen and very painful to the touch. Pulse very quick and suppressed, tongue thickly coated and rather dry, thirst increased. She had, during the past few weeks, been arduously engaged in nursing the sick, which had materially, weakened her otherwise good constitution and reduced her strength-she appeared in her present condition very feeble and exhausted. Acornite and Bryonica (3d) dissolved in water, alternately every two hours a teaspoontfnl, was prescribed. In the evening, almost the same symptoms presented themselves, except an additional perspiration, which did not relieve her agony. Bryonict (3d) and Mercury (6) dissolved in water were now given in alternation, every two hours a teaspoonful, and a wet bandage put around her in the region of the stomach. Soon after this application, her condition improved decidedly; she was able to turn herself; in the [Page 359](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/361) INFLAMMATION OP THE STOMACII. 359 morning but very little soreness was left, and on the same evening she conversed cheerfully, sitting up in the bed. The gastric-bilious symptoms disappeared as rapidly as the congestion receded; another application of the wet bandage that evening made her feel still more comfortable, and the next morning she needed no further attendance. Thus this dangerous case had terminated favorably within the short period of a little more than two days. We have frequently attended similar patients; our climate, particularly in the summer, favoring abdominal congestions of this kind, but never was the recovery as quick as in this case. The relief by the wet bandage was immediate, according to the patient's own expression. ADMINISTRATION, DIET, AND REGIMEN, the same as in'' Pleurisv.\"vo ABDOMINAL INFLAMMATION. We will now proceed to the inflammations of those organs which lie between the peritoneun, or that serous membrane which envelops all the abdominal viscera. The inflammations of these organs have this one peculiar feature in regard to the pulse, that the higher the inflammation runs, the smaller and more suppressed the pulse appears; sometimes it is only discoverable by hard pressure. 1. tyl2ammation of tlhe Stomach. (Gastrilts.) DIAGNOSIs.-This is a dangerous disease, and ought not to be treated by laymen; but, on account of its rapid course, we feel the necessity of introducing it here, in order to enable every one to diminish, or take away entirely its danger, by applying' those remedies which have a specific bearing upon it. Gastritis is characterized by a constant, violent, burning', and stitching pain in the gastric regions, increased by pressure, respiration, or taking any kind of food; beside this, there are heat, swelling, and tension, with pulsation in the regionl of the stomach; noililng Awill stay on the stomach, not [Page 360](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/362) 360 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND BOWELS. even pure water-; although there is great thirst, yet water is frequently rejected, because sometimes, beside other violent nervous fits and convulsions, hydrophobic symptoms occur, withl tetanic spasms, great and sudden prostration; fainting; the pulse gets smaller, more wiry; extremities cooler, and the restless anxiety greater, the higher the inflammation is. Deatll lakes place, either by gangrene (which is announced by sudden cessation of all pain, small, remitting pulse, scarcely perceptible, hands and feet icy cold), or by nervous paralysis, with spasms and fainting fits, together with symptoms of the utmost debility. Signs of improvement are, when the pulse becomes larger and broader, the pains less severe, without ceasing entirely, and the hands and feet warmner. This disease may, after an improper treatment, pass into chronic inflammation, induration, or ulceration of the stomach. CAUSES. - Bilious diarrheas, if suddenly checked; acrid poisons taken into the stomach; abuse of emetics and ardent spirits; transfer of gout; suppressed secretions; external injuries; or drinking of water when heated. TREATMENT.-Aconite is the first remedy to be given, if the pains are severe, and the heat great in the stomach, or when a chill preceded the affection, or when it was caused by taking cold drinks when overheated. ADMINISTRATION.-Dissolve twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water; give every twenty or thirty minutes a teaspoonful until ten spoonfuls are taken; if then not better, select another remedy, which must be prepared and given in the same manner, until better, or another remedy is necessary. Bryonict. Generally after Aconite or Ipecac. Ipecac. After Aconite, if vomiting predominates, and the disease was caused by indigestion, but the tongue is clear. Antimnon. Under similar symptoms as Ipecac.; but the tongue has a thick coating of -white or yellowish mucus. Pulsatilla. After Iptecac. or Bryonia, or when the disease [Page 361](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/363) INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH. 361 was caused by indigestion, or a chill in the stomach from having taken ice. Arsenic. For a similar condition, but there is rapid failure of strength, pale, sunken countenance, cold extremities; alternately with Veratrunm. TVeratrum. For similar symptoms (see drowsiness, delirium, loss of consciousness. Arnica. In case external injuries were the cause of the disease. Niux voimica and Lachesis, in alternation, if abuse of ardent spirits caused the gastritis; after which, Lachesis and Arsenic may be alternated with benefit. Cantharis. In the most violent cases, particularly when the burning pain is intolerable; alternately with China. Op2ium aind C'am/phor, alternately, if no remedy seems to ameliorate the case; drowsiness and stupor, particularly in drunkards; afterward give other suitable remedies which will have a better effect. For gastritis from acrid poisons, see \" Poison.\" After the poison is removedl, treat as above. For the chronic form of the disease, see \"Dyspepsia, Cardialgia, Spasms of the Stomach.\".APPLICATION OF WATER.-A lukewarm sitting-bath, reaching above the navel, is recommended; in the bath the patient's abdomen is constantly rubbed. After the vomiting ceases wet compresses are applied on the stomach and cold injections used to remove constipation. The chronic form requires strict dieting', the constant wearing of wet bandages, frequent sweatings in the wet sheet, foot and sitting-baths; beside the frequent drinking of small quantities of cold water. DIET AND REGIMEN.-AS during the height of the disease nothing will stay on the stomach, it is better to offer the patient nothing but water; afterward the mildest gruel, made 31 [Page 362](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/364) 362 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND BOWE1,S. of rice or flour, milk and water, buttermilk, gum-arabic water, milk-toast. Continue this diet for some time before it is changed for a stronger one; and then only soups and mild vegetables. 2. kfIaemrmation of the Bowels. (Enteritis.) This disease occurs in two varieties; either idiopathic, where no other disease preceded it, or symptomatic, when it appears; in consequence of other diseases, such as \"Typhus,\" etc. The former is very acute, but of rare occurrence, and involves in its sphere the mucous membrane, as well as the submucous tissue and peritoneal coat-a very painful alnd dangerous disease; while the latter, not so acute in its course, occurs more frequently, attacking the mucous membrane of the intestines, mostly in portions; being, on that account, not so painful and dangerous, but sometimes leading to ulcerations of the bowels. DIAGNOSIS of the idiopathic or very acute forme.-Violent burning or pungent pain, permanently on one spot of the abdomen, generally in the region of the navel; increased by the slightest touch or movement; with tension, heat, and bloatedness of the abdomen; obstinate constipation; vomiting of slime. or bile, finally of faeces (ileus miserere); violent thirst, yet cold drinks do not agree; sobbing, anxiety; restlessness; pulse small, contracted, as in gastritis; urine frequently suppressed. The fatal termination of this disease occurs under similar symptoms as in gastritis by gangrene; the most violent pain suddenly disappearing, pulse. sinking, remittent, imperceptible; involuntary, cadaverously fetid stools. The symptoms of recovery are the same as in gastritis. In regard to the obstinate constipation which is such a constant symptom in this disease, we would remark that this does not constitute dr cause the disease, but is its natural consequence, and disappears as soon as the inflammation, by the proper [Page 363](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/365) INFLAMMATION OF THE BOWELS. 363 remedies, is reduced. Any violent attempt, by severe medicines, to effect a passage, would only add to the inflammation, and hasten a fatal result. The best expedient for this purpose is, beside the medicines to be mentioned hereafter, injections of tobacco smoke, which relieve the pain, or lukewarm baths, which destroy the spasms, often remaining aftel the inflammation is subdued. TREATMENT. \u2014ACOnite must be used first, as directed in gastritis. It is the principal remedy as long as the accompanying fever is intense and the skin very hot. In severe cases, Arsenic and Veratrum after it, in a similar manner, as directed in gastritis. In less severe cases, Lachesis, Belladonna, and JMercury, in alternation, will suffice, if the skin has become cooler, from the application of Aconite, but there still remain great soreness of the abdomen and intense thirst. These medicines must be separately dissolved in water (twelve glob. to half a teacupful), and every two hours, alternately, a teaspoonful given, until three or four teaspoonfuls of each are taken, or until better. But in the severest cases, when vomiting of feces appears (ileus rniserere), Opiumn must be administered, every hour a dose (four giob.), and if not relieved within six, eight, or twelve hours, Plumbum, in the same manner. It is in this stage where injections of an infusion of tobacco, or injecting tobacco smoke, is of the greatest benefit; also a lukewarm bath, to relax the whole system, and facilitate a decided reaction. DIAGNOSIS of the symnptomratic or subacute form.-This is alwvays a concomitant symptom in typhus, or other malignant fevers; also in consumption of the bowels. The pain of the abdomen consists of a soreness, aggravated by hard pressure, and after cold drinks and indigestible food; the tongue is red, smooth, sometimes shining; loss of appetite; thirst variable; constant dryness in the mouth and throat; nausea and [Page 364](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/366) 364 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND BOWELS. vomiting are more or less present, the more so, the nealer the inflamed portions of the intestines are to the stomach. When the lower parts are more inflamed, which is indicated by the pain in that region, diarrhea of a slimy mucus, often mixed with blood, is present, as in dysentery. This is particularly the case in the beginning of Consumption of the bowels, such as nursing females are sometimes subject to, see \" Diseases of Females.\" TREATMENT. \u2014If this disease occurs in typhus or other malignant fevers, see their respective chapters. In the commencement of a typhus, if the pain in the abdomen is excessive, give a few doses of Aconite, every two or three hours one (four glob.); after which give Bryonia and R2hus tox. (in a half a teacupful of water, twelve glob. dissolved), every two hours, alternately, a teaspoonful. See \"Typhus Fever.\" If it resembles a bloody dysentery, after the use of Aconite as above, give Belladonna and lMfercury in alternation (dissolve of each twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water), every hour a teaspoonful, until better; after which.Nitric acid generally suits, particularly if the patient has already taken a good deal of calomel; or Colocynth, if bilious, green matter is vomited or discharged by the dysenteric operation. For the application of these medicines, and of Sulphur, which is important in this disease, see \" Dysentery.\" If worms are suspected to be the cause of the inflammation of the bowels, or are complicated with it, see \" Worms.\" If the disease resembles or runs into consumption of the bowels, see \" Diarrhea\" and \" Diarrhea of lying-in Women.\" The chronic form of this disease requires the same remedies, only administered not so often, because the symptoms are less urgent. In all severe cases of this kind, it would be indispensably necessary to apply to a homceopathic physician. if one can be had. [Page 365](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/367) INFLAMMATION OF TfE LIVER. 0,5 APPLICATION OF WATER, see preceding article. DIET AND REGIMEN, the same as in \" Gastritis.\" INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER. (kelpotitis.) DIAGNosIs. \u2014This inflammation differs according to its place in the liver. a. When the surface and the convex, or upper part of the liver is inflamed, there are in the right hypochondriumn sometimes stitches, at other times burning pains, often as violent as in pleurisy, shooting to the breast bone, the rilght shoulderblade, increased by deep respiration, frequently accompanied with cough and vomiting; in this form the patient cannot lie on the right side. b. When the concave, or lower part, and the substance of the liver is inflamed, there is not so much pain, but more a feeling of pressing, heaviness, as of a bag lying in that region; the color of the eyes and face become yellowish, as if jaundice were present; bitter taste, and vomiting; in this form the patient cannot lie on the left side. In both forms general inflammatory fever is present more or less, and the region of the liver sensitive to pressure, and apparently bloated and hot. The first form may be mistaken for pleurisy, as the symptoms are very similar; but, as in such a case the treatment would be the same, no danger can result from such a mistake. If hepatitis is not well treated, it has the tendency to pass into the chronic state, forming ulcerations, which either appear externally or communicate internally with the intestines or the lungs, causing inflammation of these organs; indurations, adhesion, gangrene, are also issues of neglected hepatitis. CAusEs.-Summer heat and hot climate predispose to this disease; also, the abuse of ardent spirits; beside, it is excited by external lesions, concussion of the brain, suddenly suppressed diarrhea or dysentery, hemorrhoidal congestion, or [Page 366](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/368) 366 AFFECTIONS OF TIlE STOMACH AND BOWELS. strong emetics or purgatives, the abuse of mercury, the presence of stones in the gall-bladder, indigestion, violent passion or anger, particularly when immediately followed by drinking ardent spirits. TRnEATMENT.-The following are the principal remedies neCessary for the acute form of this disease: Aconite, induration of the liver (liver complaint): Nie7ux vom., Sulphur. (Other serious chronic diseases must be treated by a homceopathic physician.) SYMPTOMATIC DETAIL. - Aconite. At the commencement of the treatment, when there are violent inflammatory fever, shooting pain in the region of the liver, tossing about, fear of death, and anguish; pain seems to be insupportable. Belladonna,. Pressing pains extending to the chest and shoulders; fullness in the pit of the stomach and around the short ribs; difficult and anxious respiration; after Aco~nite. Che'idonium.

After a fit of passion, or when there is shoot. ing and beating under the short-ribs of the right side, excessively tender when touched; nausea, with sour and bitter taste; fits ofy acguish; shortness of breath, thirst, vertigo, and headache; suitable for drunkards, and in chronic liver affections, previous to Sul]phur. Anam1uNISTRATION.-Dissolve of the remedy selected, twelve globules in half a teacupful of water, and give every two hours a teaspoonful, until three or four spoonfuls are taken, or until another remedy is indicated by the change of symptoms; as the patient gets better, lengthen the intervals; as soon as greatly relieved, discontinue all medicine for fortyeight hours, when one dose (four glob.) of Sulplhur may be administered to complete the cure. In chronic hepatitis, give of the necessary remnedy only once in twenty-four hours a dose (four glob.), for two or three [Page 368](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/370) 36~8 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND BOWELS. days; then discontinue six or eight days before the next remedy is given. APPLICATION OF WATER.- The wet bandage is beneficial; constipation is relieved by cold injections. The treatment of the chronic form is assisted by the coni stant wearing of a wet bandage around the abdomen. DIET AND REGIMEN.-N-O meat or meat so(ps of any kind, but farinaceous substances; rice and oatmeal gruel, sweetened and made palatable by lemon-juice, lemonade, cold or warm, prunes sweetened or boiled in gruels, baked apples, toasted bread, toast-water, cold water alone. Keep the patient quiet and comfortable as regards temperature. JAUNDICE. (Icterus.) DIAaNOSIS.-This disease, well known by the yellow color it imparts to all the white parts of the body, is not to be considered dangerous of itself, but becomes only so by neglect, when other serious disorders, hectic fever, dropsy, etc., may follow. In most cases it is the result of neglected liver diseases, or is caused by taking cold which affected the liver; also, by worms or gall-stones, obstructing the gall-duct, or is induced by excessive mental emotions. In jaundice the bowels become constipated, and if fseces pass, they are hard and whitish; the urine is orange-colored, and the skin dry, or, if moist, it is from weakness, and the perspiration imparts a yellow color to the patient's linen. Sometimes a slight fever accompanies these symptoms, which increases toward night, remitting or even intermitting in the morning; this is the case in the milder form. In the severer forms of this disease, accompanied with high fever, the brain becomes affected, which, if not relieved soon, may cause the death of the patient (see for the treatment of such a state, \" Inflammation of the Brain\"). TREATMENT. \u2014The principal object must be to increase, by degrees, the healthy ac/tion of the skin; OF TIHE SPLEEN. 3G(9 ought to keep warmly covered in bed in a warm room, and take, for the first three or four days,.2lerczry, morning, noon, and night a dose (four glob.); if not better at the expiration of four days, give;lepctar and C/('lidoi;m, L,2.; but if siglns of amelioration appear, give it at longer intervals; this course generally removes the disease in eight or ten days, during which time the patient must keep in an equal, warm temperature and perspiration. In very obstinate cases, Lachesis,;itiric acid, Sulp:lhur, may be given afterward in the same manner. Jaundice, caused by a fit of passion, requires Chamomile, followed by u5Vx vom. If it is caused by thle abuse of.lMercury, or (loomel, give China, -Hepl)ar szuldh.,,achesis, or Sulp2hur. If a child becomes yellow from having talen rhubarb too often or too much, give hctha(moile, leircory, oir Chelidol. If persons are liable to jaundice upon every trifling occasion, give Lach., ('held. and Slph., every week one dose (four glob.), alternately, to eradicate the disposition. If jaundice is complicated with fever, see \"Inflammation of the Liver.\" APPLICATION OF WATER. - Lukewarm sitting-baths, wet bandages around the chest and stomach, and the sweating in the wet sheet are powerful auxiliaries in the treatment of this disease; constipation is relieved by cold injections. DIET AND REGIMEN, as ill \" Hepatitis.\" INTFLAMMATION OF THE SPLEEN. (Sllenitis.) DIAGNosI. \u2014 Sharp, pressing, or shooting pains in the left side, below the short-ribs; the spleen on pressure is painful, and when pressed upward excites cough, and nausea in the stomach, sometimes vomiting of blood; if fever is present it is very high, Nwith all the concomitant; symptoms of inflammation of internal organs. The region of the spleen is enlaroged and conogested. [Page 370](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/372) 370 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND BOWELS. CAUSES. \u2014 Similar to those of inflanmnation of the liver, beside the abuse of quinine or Peruvianz bCark; also, living in a marshy region causes congestion of the spleen, and conse quently inflammation, under otherwise trifling' circumstances TREATIMENT.-We have an acute and chronic forml For the acute Acoiote, Bijyoenzi, Clhelil., and (i/,iouL are the principal remedies, to be administered as directed in hepatitis. If vomiting of blood is present, or sometimes even the blood is discharged by the stools, Arnica, ]Rhus tox., and Arsenic, followed by China, are necessary, one remedy after the other, in the same manner as above. For the chironic form, C9lze2iCs' e7t. iJdaotion administration as directed in the chronic form of hepatitis; but it is strongly recommended to procure the aid of a skillful homceopathic physician for its treatment. APPLICATION OF WATER, DIET AND REGIMEN, as in \" Hepatitis.\" WORMS. Every part of the system can, under favorable circumstances, create and sustain worms, or other imperfectly organized animals; thus, the skin, liver, lungs, kidneys, even the brain and eyes, in some animals, are favorable places for their generation, the species of animals varying according to the organ attacked. WTorms are most frequently found in toe intestinal canal; there are three kinds of worms met with, the Ascaris, or two varieties: a. The broad one (temnia lata), varying from three to twelv-e feet in length, seldom. comes away entire, but in joints; and b. The solitctry tal)eworm (tme nia solium.), with long and slender joints, reaclhing' tLe length of tlllty feet. DisGNosIs.-It is freqluently an easy matterl to decide [Page 371](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/373) WORMS. 371 positively on the presence of worms in the system, as most all those symptoms which could lead to such a conclusion are also met with in other diseases, save the one symptom, surest of all, that is, the passage of some worms, or undoubted pieces of them. This uncertainty in the diagnosis of the worm disease is no less annoying and embarrassing for an allopathic practitioner; as his prescriptions are dangerous, and in most cases, without good or decided result for the little patient, as with the worms their cause is not always expelled. Homceopathy, on account of its guiding principle, avoids either of the two dangerous issues, and, prescribing for the ostensible symptoms as they reflect the inward disease, cures and eradicates this surely, safely, and mildly. Merely expelling the worms, by remedies which have no specific bearing upon the worm disease, is of no essential use, and requires often enormous quantities of poisonous and dangerous stuff before one of the worms is sickened, killed, or expelled. Yes, I have seen the foundation of painful chronic diseases laid by the over-medication in the presumed or real presence of worms; there are even cases where children have died under' the operation of those drugs, which allopathists consider necessary to apply in such dangerous doses. The most irrational, nay, a real lottery business, is the use of those manifold nostrums, in the shape of lozenges, syrups, etc., which generally contain one or more specific anti-worm remedies; for instance, worm-seed, or pink-root, which given in small and not offensive doses would produce salutary effects, but in the combination of dangerous purgatives expose the little patients to death or misery; at least, the smallest number escape unhurt, most of them receiving injuries of the abdomen, the bad consequences of which impede not a little the future develop. ment of the child. Worms, as such, are not dangerous. They have no teeth, and consequently cannot eat children up alive. It is true, they can and will disturb the quiet and rest of a child, and [Page 372](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/374) 372 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND BOWELS. make it pick at the nose, or cough, or cry out suddenly, or even have fits, etc.; yet all this is only produced by the worms having been made restless, by the presence of sickness in the system, which causes them to touch the walls of the intestines, usually avoided by them \u2014living in and of the mass of mucus and other nutritive substances, with which the system had been indiscriminately, and in too large quantities burdened. As soon as the system recovers from its own disease, either from cold or irregularity of diet, the worms return to their usual, unobtrusive quiet again, giving no signs of their existence, nor causing alarm. Every person, more or less, has worms without the least injury to the system. Neither is it absolutely the quantity of them which is the most dangerous quality of this disease; a few worms can cause as many fits, or other spasmodic symptoms, as whole clusters of them. It depends altogether on the accompanying disease; and this it is which we will have to treat, before we can expect the worms to leave the system (which I have seen frequently, after a dose of homeopathic preparation of Sulp9hur), or to be absorbed (digested and reduced to mucus, from which they originated). This latter is the most common result of homoeopathic medicines in this disease. In such cases, the children show signs of improvement, as soon as their abdomen becomes reduced in size and hardness; their complexion improves, they become more agile, grow better in height, and sleep quiet. And this result is always attained by the judicious use of homceopathic medicines in this disease, in whatever form it may appear; for instance, as fits, diarrhema,, scrofula, etc. Fits, occasioned by worms, are not in the least dangerous, and only become so by unwisely dealing with them. The principal symptoms, by which the presence of worms in the system is indicated, are the following: the complexion of the patient is pale and changeable; livid circles around the eyes; accumulation of saliva in the mouth in the morn [Page 373](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/375) DISEASES CAUSED BY WORMS. 373 ing, and when not having taken nourishment for some time; irregular appetite; nausea; fetid breath; great hunger; picking and boring at the nose, with sneezing; abdomen enlarged, but not hard; frequent distressing pain in the stomach, in the region of the navel, which forces the patient to draw up the limbs against the abdomen, or lie on the stomach when going to sleep; pupils of the eye dilated; bleeding at the nose; starting, as if from fright, during sleep, also grinding of the teeth; disposition to spasms, and unusual emaciation. The surest sign, however, is the discharge of worms, or parts of worms. Signs of tapeworm, in particular, are: a sensation, as of something suddenly rising from the left side into the throat and falling back, or as if a lump in one or the other side was making an undulatory motion; dizziness, particularly in the morning, before eating. Signs of ascarides, or pin-worms, especially, are: itching in the anus, more in the evening or at night; difficulty of making urine; tenesmus; apparent hemorrhoidal complaints; discharge mucus from or (fluor albus). Signs of maw-worm, or lumbricus, particularly, are: all the above general symptoms of worms, but frequently stomachache, which is relieved after drinking sweet, cold milk. Diseases caused by the Presence of Worms. Infancy is the age, when, on account of the general predomninancy of nutrition, laxity and weakness by accumulation of mucus in the intestines preponderate; and consequently, those remote causes for the generation of worms, which may be favored even by circumstantial ones, such as flabby oonstitution of the child, damp habitation, and other epidemical and endemical influences. This variety of the remote causes of worms gives rise to an equal variety of diseases, flowing from the same source (the worms), yet different, according to their exciting causes. [Page 374](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/376) 374 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND) BOWELS. Thus, these diseases vary, from the most trifling illness, to the most severe colics, and dangerous fevers. The worms create, operating on the nervouzs system by sympathy, convulsions, all kinds of spasms, epilepsy, St. Vitus's dance (chorea), somnambulism, periodical paralysis, insanity, fury. On the or blood system: fevers, congestions to bowels, hemorrhages, eruptions on the skin, appearing in irregular blotches of a scarlet color. On the reproductive system (the intestines themselves): pains, spasms, increased secretion and accumulation of mucus, diarrhea, dysentery, worm colic. TREATMENT.-The principal remedies for thle diseases produced by worms on the nervous system, as and Cina`c,, Af]ercury, Sulphur, S2pigelia. (For the detail of these medicines, see below.) Especially against tapeworms, the most suitable remedies are: A/ercury, and Sulphur, to be given every four or six days, alternately, a dose (six glob.) after which Calcarea ca'rb., Graphites, Stannum, may be given in the same way, if necessary. Cupr. oxyd. nigr. is strongly recommended. See Boston Quart. Homceop. Jour., Vol. I., p. 138. Against ascarides (pin-worms): Aconite, Ignatia, Stannum, or Cina and Sulp)hur, alternately, every second or third evening a dose, until better. An injection every evening of an ounce of pure sweet oil (olive oil), without any other admixture, is an excellent adjunct against these troublesome worms. The ascarides lodge never higher up in the abdomen than the rectum; therefore, can be expelled easily, or killed. Against maw-worms, or worms in the intestinal canal, are [Page 375](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/377) DISEASES CAUSED BY WORMS.

At the end of every case of worm affection, after other remedies have either subdued the fever, or mitigated the nervous symptoms. Give every evening one ('ose (two or three glob.), for three evenings, anrd then wait from [Page 376](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/378) 376 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND BOWELS. six to eight days, before another remedy is applied, or the same repeated, if necessary. Cina. This is one of the most important remedies, particularly when there is boring at the nose, fever (after the application of Aconite); irritability; restlessness at night; desire for things which are rejected when offered; pale, bloated face, with livid circles around the eyes; craving for food, even after a meal; the child wants bread, potatoes, and other gross victuals; colic; griping; distension and hardness of the abdomen; discharge of pin and large worrns; diarrhea; weakness of the limbs; the child cannot stand any more on its feet; spasmodic movements in the limbs. ADMINISTRATION, see Aconite. CinaCc. When the children are very nervous, cry out in their sleep, or have severe colic pains, give every one or two hours a dose (two or three glob.), until better, or another remedy is necessary. Where children cry out in the night, groan, and are restless, give every evening only one dose (two or three glob.), until better. Spigelia. In severe cases of worm colic, fever, and diarrhea, with craving appetite and chilliness, or where the symptoms appear regularly at the same time of the day. Administration in acute cases, the same as Aconite in fever. In chronic cases, every evening a dose (two or three glob.) Hyoscyamus. In worm fevers, when the patients are very nervous, restless, cry out, want to run off, and stool or urine passes off involuntarily. Administration as in Aconite. Belladonna. Worm colic after the administration of Aconite, when great pains remain in the stomach, which are relieved by lying on the bowels, starting in the sleep, sensibility to light, headache; on awaking, the child does not know where it is, etc. Particularly useful in scrofulous children, with distended abdomen and red cheeks, or where red [Page 377](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/379) DISEASES CAUSED BY WORMS. 377 blotches, like erysipelas, appear on different parts of the body.

Silicea. If a worm fever assumes the slow, chronic form, with or without diarrhea, particularly in scrofulous children. Administration as in Sulp2hur. DIET AND REGIMIEN. \u2014In worm fever, adhere to the diet recommended for common fever. In severe worm colic, give as a palliative, cold, sweet milk, from time to time. In diarrhea, avoid acids, firuits, and all indigestible articles; give, rather, soups of mutton or lamb, with rice. Avoid, in chronic worm diseases, heavy, gross nourishment, such as too much bread and butter, potatoes, heavy puddings, pies, raw or boiled vegetables; but meat-soups of any kind, meat, roasted or broiled, plenty of cold water and milk, are beneficial. Beside, bathing in cold water, and exercise in the open air. In worm fever the wet bandage and sitting-bath are recommended. 32 [Page 378](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/380) 378 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACII AND BOWELS. CONSTIPATION. COSTIVENESS. This term must not always be taken in the absolute sense as a diseased state of the bowels; as there are persons who naturally have only every two or three days an evacuationa habit which frequently promotes rather than disturbs general health, if the latter is not interfered with by an unwise use of medicines, such as taking pills or aperients of a drastic or saline nature. As a general rule, we can consider it the normal state of the bowels, to have one evacuation every day. This ought to become a fixed rule and habit, as it frequently corrects costiveness of the bowels, without the use of any medicine. Some occupations of life predispose to costiveness, particularly those which allow but little exercise. Persons, under such circumstances, must abandon these occupations, if possible, for a length of time, take a great deal of exercise in the open air, change the diet (see below), and make use of cold water, externally and internally, in large quantities (see \"Application of Water\"). Nothing is more injurious than the continued use of medicinal aperients. They render the bowels, in time, more costive and torpid. The best expedient for facilitating an immediate action on the bowels, if wanted, is an injection, either of cold water, if the person otherwise is in health or the patient prefers it, or lukewarm water, sweet oil, or lard, and a small piece of castile-soap dissolved in it, if the constipation has been very obstinate, or a quick evacuation is wanted, as in children, when they have fits, etc. In most cases of acute diseases, constipation is only one of the many symptoms constituting the disease; because it disappears as soon as the whole complex of symptoms has been taken away.* One of the most striking cases of this kind, showing in a high degree the truth of the above statement, presented itself to me a few years ago, in a lady who had been persuaded to take castor oil, three days [Page 379](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/381) CONSTIPATION - COSTIVRENESS. [' i 9 If, however, constipation is tOhe only or principal symptoim in a disease, as in m/serer-', leatd colc, etc., we have remedies which co-mnbat it more s:lfely and successfully than all thle aperients commonly used. Cases of this kind, however, must be treated by experienced lhom>nopalthic phlysicianls. TREATaMET.-We will now give first aC tabular view of the causes and complications of constipations, with their principal remedies, the detailed symptoms of which follow below.These must be consulted before a selection is made. Constipation in general, or a carriage': Plairna, Opiunm. after her confinement, although in former cases of this kind she always had suffered verly much after its use, from irritation of the intestines. After the administration of the castor oil, a violent and painful diarrhea appeared, th1reatening fearful consequences for the life of thle patient. This was, however, soon removed, by the exhibition of China, Mercury, and Pulsa.tilla, and her health decidedly improved, from day to day, her appetite and strength returned, and she moved about as if she was well; yet there was no disposition for evacuating, until on the tzentysecond day after the last evacuation, when it appeared, without any artificial means, in a perfectly healthy condition. During the eight days previous to it, the patient had been allowed a good nourishing diet, and enough of it, too. I have frequently had cases where patients had no -evacuations for eight, ten, or twelve days; but I never have experienced their suspension for twenty-two days, except in the above case. [Page 380](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/382) 380 AFFECTIONS OF constipation during fevers or bilious attacks, where headache, chilliness and rheumatic pains predominate; particularly, also, in warm weather; the patient is of a nervous, irritable temperament. After it, or in alternation with it, iVeux vom. tiux vormica. Is of the most frequent application in hypochondriacal persons, or those suffering from piles; also, after derangement of the stomach, when there is frequent but ineffectual efort to evacuate, or a feeling as if the anus were closed or contracted; ill-humor, fullness of the head, cannot bear the clothes tight around the waist. After it, or in alternation with it, SulpZhur. Sulphur. In all cases of habitual costiveness, or where Nux vom. was insufficient. Opoium. In all cases where there is great torpidity of the bowels, and a feeling as if the anus were closed, but without the frequent and ineffectual efforts to evacuate, as is the case in Niux vomica; the patient only feels full in his bowels, has congestion to the head, with dark redness of the face, slow and full pulse; this remedy is of frequent application in children, old persons, pregnant women, drunkards, and hypochondriacal persons. Sepia. In cases where there are, beside constipation, flashes of heat, sick-headache, a pressing down, particularly in pregnant women, or where NYux vomica, Opium, and Sulphur have been insufficient. Platina. In nervous females, and weakly hypochondriacal persons, where the stool only appears in small pieces, followed by tenesmus and tingling in the anus; shuddering, and a sensation of weakness in the abdomen; sometimes, also, a [Page 381](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/383) CONSTIPATION - COSTIVENESS. 381 constrictive pain in the abdomen, and ineffectual desire to evacuate. Compare iVux vormica. Lachesis. A very useful remedy in obstinate constipatioas during fevers, particularly where abscesses of internal organs are existing or presumed to exist, as in the liver, mesenteric glands, etc., or in alternation with Lycopocdium. Where an obstinate disposition to constipation is present, from constitutional causes, such as scrofula, which had fallen on the bowels after it disappeared from the skin, etc.; if, in such cases, these two remedies remove the costiveness, but the disease attacks the lungs and produces cough, which is worse when a part of the body gets cool by exposure, give Hep2ar sulph. See \"Dyspepbia.\" Antimon. crud. In cases where constipation and diarrhea alternate, if one ceases the other sets in; the stools are never regul, ar. Phos/phorus. If Antimon. is insufficient, or when the patient is of a consumptive habit, or has the consumption. Stannurm. If Phosphorus does not suffice, or whlen there is frequent but ineffectual desire to evacuate, particularly in consumptives. Silicea. Same as Stannum, when this is insufficient, or in children whose stomachs are distended and hard, indicating worms or swollen glands; also, in dyspeptic persons, with heart-burn, sour taste in the mouth, etc. Cocculus. See \" Sea-sickness\" and \" Colic.\" Conirnt. For old and weakly persons, who are troubled with frequent but ineffectual efforts to evacuate (after iVTux vom.); also, in scrofulous children, where the mesenteric glands are swollen (after Silicea), particularly accompanied with soreness of the abdomen.

In similar cases, where.1Tux vomica would suit, but the temperament is mild and phlegmatic; or after derangement of the stomach by fat food, the patient appearing morose and silent; also, after abuse of quinine, either with [Page 382](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/384) 382 AFvFECTIONS OF1 TI-IE ST'OM[_C[iT AND BOWELS. or without the return of the fever and ague, and then in alternation with Carbo veg. This remedy, particularly, when persons have becorme very much debilitated, complain of rheumatism, piles, or have the coszumption. Veratrtum. After Opium, when there is great torpor in the bowels, deficiency of expulsive power; or where the abdomen becomes very tender to the touch (and then in alternation with Arsenic); see \"Bilious gastric Fevers;\" also, after abuse of quinine, when there is great congestion to the head and hypochondriacal feeling. ADMINISTRATION.-In cases where constipation exists as the only troublesome symptom, give the medicine selected in quick succession and large doses; for instance, Ntcx vomica, every three or four hours a dose (six to eight glob.) for one or two days, until relief is obtained, or another remedy is chosen; or Lachesis and Lycopodium, in alternation, three times a day a dose (six glob.); but where constipation is habitual or constitutional, the remedies must be administered at longer intervals; for instance, iVux vomica, every evening a dose (four glob.), for three or four days; then discontinue an equal length of time without taking medicine, after which either repeat it or select another remedy, if necessary, which in most cases will be Sulphur. APPLICATION OF WATER, internally and externally, is an important auxiliary for the cure of constipation. When the latter is not of very long standing or not very obstinate, the injections can be made of cold water, of which two or three every day may be taken; the sitting-bath in such a case may be of cold water also; but if the constipation is very obstinate, take for the above-named applications milkwarm water, anda let the sitting-bath reach above the navel, and lengthen the time of application; let the patient use it for half-an-hour or upward. In inflammatory diseases, fevers, etc., the injections must be made of cold or cool water. Dr. Gat chel says: [Page 383](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/385) CONSTIPATION. 383 In constipation, the muscles fail to act sufficiently, and the membrane to pour out its lubricating mucus. In consequence of which failures, the excrement is dry, and is not duly pushed along. Now it is a law of the involuntary muscles, that motion communicated to one part has a tendency to propagate itself to other parts. And various kinds of stimuli, such as pressure with the warm hand, or the application of heat or cold to the exterior of the abdomen has a tendency to produce this motion. And this motion, probably, favors the pouring out of the mucus from the membrane which lines the muscular coat. Of this susceptibility of the muscular coat to artificial stimuli, we can avail ourselves to promote the relief of the sufferer from constipation. The application of heat for this purpose has been employed. But the tendency'of heat being to debilitate, it is somewhat objectionable. The stimulus of the hand has not the objectionable feature which belongs to heat. And the sufferer may find present relief, and sometimes partially overcome the habit of constipation, by grasping the abdomen with the hand, and at the same time pressing inward with a kneading motion, such as is used in the kneading of bread. This kneading, while useful all over the abdomen, is most important along the course of the large bowel, from the right hip up to the border of the ribs, so across to the left side, and down to the left hip. The objection against stimulating the bowels with heat, does not apply to cold. The primary effect of cold being to depress the vital energies, the secondary effect, or re-active influence, is to exalt the vital energies, and thus to invigorate. Cold can be employed in various ways. The mere application of the wet compress will sometimes cause at once a movement of previously constipated bowels. And the frequent application will sometimes cure. But the sitting-bath should not be neglected, since this has a great tendency to invigorate the bowels. [Page 384](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/386) 384 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND BOWELS. DIET AND R,EGIMEN. \u2014These are important agents in the cure of constipation; first of all is the habit of attending to the calls of nature carefully and regularly, at a certain time, say after breakfast, though there should be no actual result fronom it; secondly, the careful avoidance of all nourishment which is confining' in its character, such as salted meats, cheese, rice, wheaten flour, except these things are mixed in a sufficient quantity with their opposites, such as have a loosening quality, fresh meat, and soups made of it, green vegetables, and fruits, except almonds or nuts. But the chief promoter of a healthy action on the bowels is the frequent and liberal use of cold water, internally and externally, with bodily exercise in the open air. The cold and ice water can be drank freely during and after a meal, without the least inconvenience, and ought to be preferred to the use of wines, brandies, tea or coffee. DIARRHEA. LOOSENESS OF THE BOWELS. This complaint varies so much in regard to time of duration, form and cause, that we are obliged to give here a general view of its varieties. It is either recent, lasting only for a few hours or days, or is chronic, lasting for months or years. The discharge itself may vary as regards consistency or character, either watery, fluid, fecal, slimy, mattery, bilious, or bloody (see \" Dysentery\"). Sometimes a diarrhea is dangerous; at other times salutary, as in biliousness or after indigestion (see these articles). In general, however, the popular idea of the harmless or beneficial nature of diarrheas, which the common practice of the, old school of medicine has freely propagated, must be restricted, in so far as any diarrhea is of itself an indication of a diseased state of the intestines, and no disease ought to be created or wished for where we can do without it. It has been, and is yet, to a great extent, a common expression that a good cleansing of the bowels is necessary, etc.; now, these ideas, when carried out in prac [Page 385](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/387) DIARLITTIEA-LOOSENESS OF THE BOWELS. 385 Uce, lead- sometimes to awful consequences, while the good whiclh they may occasionally produce might have been obtained by mild and rational means. See \"Constipation\" and \" Biliousness.\" On tlhe other hand, it is just as dangerous to stop a diatrllrhea suddenly by violent means, such as brandy, l)arecgoric, or astringents generally, as thereby the disease is not cured, but merely its natural outlet stopped; as if an uilcer could be cured by covering it over to confine and hide the matter, which it has to discharge. It is always fortunate if such a diarrhea reappears. TIREATMENT.-We will now give first a general view of the varieties of diarrhea, as reg'ards causes, form, and appearances, withl their principal remedies, whose detailed symptozns may be found below, and must be consulted before a choice is made. Diarrhea without pain: Cina, OF other indigestible substances, fat meats, etc., China, Pulsatilla, coffee without milk.

In chronic diarrhea of a whitish color, in scrofulous persons, and which will not yield to any other remedy. ADMINISTRATION.-In recent cases dissolve twelve glob. of the selected medicine in half a teacupful of water and take after every evacuation a teaspoonful until better, or another remedy is necessary; children half the quantity. In chronic cases take every evening and morning a teaspoonful of such a mixture, or if taken in the dry state three or four glob. at a dose. APPLICATION OF WATER in some forms of this diseased state of the body is beneficial, particularly where by a reaction on the skin we can support the effect of the proper remedies. And this can be done in chronic, debilitating, and painful diarrheas by the application of the wet bandage, at the same time being well covered for the purpose to excite perspiration; sometimes sitting-baths are also necessary. DIET AND REGISEN. - Acids or acidulated drinks, fresh vegetables, and fresh meats and meat soups are forbidden; allowed are, rice, toasted bread, boiled milk, and gruels; no coffee and spiritous liquors. Cold water can be drank, if it is otherwise not injurious. Keep quiet as much as possible, even to lying down. DYSENTERY. BLOODY FLUX. DIAGNOSIS.- This complaint is, properly speaking, not a diarrhea; as no faeces are discharged, but only mucus and blood, accompanied by constant urging to go to stool, violent tenesmus in the anus and rectum, or severe pains in the abdomen, if the disease is located higher up in the intestines. As long as this irritation or inflammation of the mucous membrane of the intestines lasts, no feeces are discharged; but when these make their appearance, even mixed with bloody mucus, the dysentery may be said to be at an end, or at least ameliorated. Its causes and course vary; sometimes it appears suddenly, -_ [Page 391](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/393) DYSENTERY-BLOODY FLUX. 391 sometimes is preceded by diarrhea and other gastric rheumatic symptoms. We dlistinguish a wlhite dysentery, where only light-colored Iilmucus (scratpings of the intestines) are discllharged; this is soon foillowed by the bloody dysentery, when the blood comes from thle highly-inflamed mucous membrane. In such cases more or less fever is always present. If the patient is relieved, the fever subsides, and gradually with it the pains, and frequent urgency of the calls, the skin becomes moist, and sleep and rest ensue. Deatlh may come from gangrene and exhaustion, but happens very seldom, under a judicious hommopathlic treatment. Very severe cases of dysentery oughlt to be trealted by a skillful homceopathic physician. The causes of this disease may be local, by irritating the intestines lirectly in eating and drinking, or general, by supIpression of perspiration (hot days and cool nights promote this cause), or by an epidemic influence, which affects in a simila'r manner the mucous memlbrane of the intestines, as the influenza-miasm attacks the nose and bronchia; also, low, marshy regions, where intermittents prevail, incline to the propagation of dysentery, which is sometimes very fatal at such places. Dysentery in most cases is a catarrhal affection of the intestinal canal, an influenza of the bowels, as it were, similar in its nature to that of the respiratory organs. properly so called. There are many points of similarity between these two catarrhs, which require to be considered. Their causes are mostly identic:ll, sometimes occurring epidemically from miasmatic influences, preceding and accompanying Asiatic cholera, etc. Again, the tendency of influenza of the respiratory organs, to run into pulmonary typhus, and consumption, is similar to that of the intestinal catarrh, which easily runs into abdominal typhus and consumption. The pathological similarity of these diseases, is retuarkably supported by the fact, that they require the same therapeutical specifics; Nux vomica and Jlfercurius [Page 392](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/394) 392 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMIACIT AND BOWELS. are used in most cases for both diseases. Yet in dysentery these specifics are often found insufficient; for this reason. The nearer an organ is situated to the nervous centers, the brain and spine, the easier and quicker it will be influeneudl by the specific means for cure; the further away fiom tlhcse centers in position, and function the slower it receives specific impressions. The intestines are not in such a direct conniln nication with the brain and spine as the respiratory orga ns we therefore have greater difficulty in reaching them through these mediums, particularly if the nervous energy is at all prostrated. In order to arouse the latter and make the intestinal nerves more susceptible to the specific influence of the medicine, we ought to give Opium in alternation with NAlx | vorm. or Mlercurius, as the case may require. Nox yvoe2. and Opitum, by frequent but ineffectual desire to evacuate, and.lercurius and Opium, by great tenesmus when evacuating. In the latter stages of dysentery, where typhoid and colliquative symptoms appear, the remedies speaifieally indicated, should be alternated with Carb. veyetab. or C]hin.a, which remedies have the same tendency to arouse the depressed nervous action in colliquative states, as Opium has in the inactivity of the nervous life, caused by congestive tendency. TREATMENT. Principal remedies are cases at the commencement, when there is fever,.pain in the head, neck and shoulders, heat and thirst alternate with shivering. This is particularly.tle case when we have cold nights and hot days. P-f roie?7(m.

Carbo veg. and Arsenic. In alternation, if the discharges become putrid in smell and involuntary; stupor ensues; red or bluish spots appear on the skin; the patient is very weak, and his breath begins to be cold; the pains in the bowels are burning. China may follow these two remedies, if the putrid smell of the discharges will not change. AD)MINISTRATION. \u2014-Dissolve twel ve glob. of the selected medicine in half a teacupful of water, and give every hour or half hour a teaspoonful, or, if the discharges are not so frequent, after every discharge a teaspoonful, until six, eight, or ten teaspoonfuls are given, when the medicine must be omitted for a couple of hours, to await its effect. If then necessary, eitlher repeat the same or select another remedy, if the symptoms have increased. But as soon as an amelioration takes place, discontinue all medicine, even if there is yet frequency of stool and violent pain at times. If very restless at night, give Belladonna'Co and Cofeac', every hour a dose (four glob.), for four hours. If the disease becomes more chronic, give the medicine at longrer intervals, say three times a day, finally only once a dlay. Cold water injections are of the greatest benefit, if the patient can bear them, and the dysentery is in its inflammatory stage. APPLICATION OF WATER.-The effect of the proper remedies may be greatly supported by using water externally and internally. In recent cases perspiring in the wet sheet, the wet compress at the same time over the abdomen, afterward an ablution and sitting-bath in milkwarm water is generally sufficient, particularly when the dysentery was caused by getting cold. But if the pains are very severe and obstinate, these must first be subdued by the wet compress, very fre [Page 395](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/397) CHOLERA MORBUS. 395 quently changed; as soon as the pains have decreased, the above process for perspiring may be commenced. The patient should drink a great deal of cold water and receive frequent injections of cold water, as long as the tenesmus is great. DIET AND REGIMEN.-Thle patient ought to lie in or on the bed constantly, even during convalescence, if possible, well covered, but not too much heated. For food, if wanted, toasted bread, softened in water or black tea; for drink, toast-water, or small quantities of warm lemonade, in the inflammatory period, and when not taking Acon. at the time. Gruels of oatmeal, rice-flour, or farina, are allowed.Meats or soups of meat, eggs, and all animal food, are strictly forbidden, even during convalescence. Wine and spirits are real poison, in this disease, and long after it. After diseases.-If cdropsy, paralysis, or r/leumatism follow the dysentery, when it has either been treated badly, or was suppressed by allopathic remedies, see these articles, or send for a homceopathic physician in time. CHOLERA MORBUS. This disease, well known under the above name, occurs mostly during the summer, in all parts of the country, north and south, resembling in its appearance the much dreaded Asiatic cholera, from which, however, it entirely differs, in character and result. (See \"Cholera Asiatica.\") DIAGNOSIS. \u2014Cholera morbus generally attacks suddenly, without any precursory symptoms, with vomiting and purging, accompanied with pains in the stomach and bowels, anxiety and tenesmus; sometimes the vomiting and urgency to go to stool are very violent and incessant, at other times less so. In very violent cases, exhaustion soon follows, pulse becomes small, scarcely perceptible, extremities cold; finally spasms and convulsions appear. At first, the discharged substances consist of the contents [Page 396](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/398) 396 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND BOWELS. of the stomach and of bile; afterward of a watery, lymphatic liquid; and finally nothlino is throxvn up; when violent retching' and goa,,'ring, with urgency to go to stool, remain. The discharges from the bowels consist first of feces; afterward of a watery, bilious liquid; each stool preceded and accomplanied with violent, burning, cutting colic, especially in the region of the navel. CAusEs.-InLtens e heat in the summer; irritable temperament; teethingo in children (see \"Cholera Infanturn\"); sudden suppression of habitual discharges, such as menstruation or diarrheas, or of cutaneous eruptions and gout; errors in diet, such as eating' unripe, watery fruit, or cldrliinOg acrid, sour liquids, beer, etc. TREATMENT.-Thle principal are: Ipecac. (administration as below); if not better within half an hour, give VIeratrum and Arsenic, in alternation, in the same manner; but if this treatment does not succeed within one and a half or two hours, select from among, the remedies described belowv one which is more homceopathically suitable, and give it as stated under \"Administration.'\" SYMPTOMATIIC DETAI,.- ChUamomile.

APPLICATION OF WATER. \u2014The patient should drink as much cold water as possible, even if it should excite more vomiting. He then should be put in a sitting-bath, during which time the extremities are constantly rubbed; if he has cramps in his bowels, give an injection of cold water. After the vomiting ceases he is rubbed dry and covered in woolen blankets with a wet compress on his abdomen; in this position he remains until perspiration sets in, after which he takes an ablution in milkwarm water. DIET AND REGIMEN.-For a drink, thin oatmeal gruel or cold water; if wanted. After the diarrhea has ceased and reaction has taken place, and if the patient is feverish, give [Page 398](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/400) 398 AFFECTIONS OF TIlE STOMACIH AND BOWELS. gruels with lemon-juice. In general, treat as stated in \" Bilious Fever.\" Beside, consult ( Cholera Asiatica.) This disease appeared hitherto among us as an epidemic. Before it, the star of Allopathy grew pale, and is ever since on its downward course; with it Homceopathy battled most successfully, and ever since her banner floats unfurled in every clime. DIAGNOSIS.- Sudden prostration of strength; diarrhea of watery substances (rice-water discharges, without smell or color; similar, profuse vomitings, which follow each other quickly. Altliough these evacuations may give the patient a little relief, it is only momentary; his prostration increases constantly until cramps appear in the feet, hands, limbs, and.srms, sometimes in the bowels and breast; insatiable thirst, with a burning sensation under the sternum (in the region of the heart). Agonizing restlessness precedes the last stage \u2014 that of collapse, in which, to the above symptoms are added, cessation of circulation of the blood in the extremities, which assume an icy coldness, while the heart palpitates violently, no pulse is perceptible; tongue and breath grow cold, agonizing oppression in breathing; hollow, hoarse, and shrill voice; blue lips and nails; livid countenance; sunken eyes; shriveled skin on hands and feet. During all this time, the secretion of urine is stopped. Finally, the skin of the patient is covered with a cold, clammy perspiration. Up to this time, the patient was perfectly conscious, although feeble; but now he sinks into stupor, with bloodshot, upturned eyes, and expires. Although Asiatic cholera presents itself in the form of a diartlrhea, yet it is not such; because no fecal matter is found in the discharges; its nature consists in a decomposition of the blood, produced by an unknown agent (miasm or ani [Page 399](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/401) ASIATIC CHOLERA-CHOLERA and aided by and physical debilities, such as fear, care, overpowering sympatlhy, weakness of body and mind by niglht-watching, exposure, etc. This decomposition of the blood in its solid and liquid parts (coagulum and serum) may be the work of days, hours, or minutes. Generally, however, it commences in the early morning hours, at which time most of the cholera attacks begin. The watery part of the blood (serum) escaping fiom the blood-vessels, passes into the stomacllh and bowels, whence it is ejected in violent gushes, or runs from the bowels in streams. Thus we see that the first appearances of cholera asiatica are those of a hemorrhage of the white part of the blood; a view with which the consequent symptoms in the following stages of the disease can easily be harmonized. The cramps in the muscles of the extremities and bowels are caused by the cessation of the action of arterial blood on tile muscles, and cease immediately, as soon as the arterial irritation reaches them again. It would carry us too far, to explain all the following symptoms of the disease; nor would it be of any practical use.This, however, we must state yet, that in that form of Cholera Asiatica, called the sicca or dry cholera, where no discharge from the stomach and bowels takes place, the disagreement with the above theory is only apparent; because, by the suddenness of the attack, the decomposition of the blood is rendered so general and great at once, that the cramps follow immediately, before the serum has time to escape. PREVENTION. - Duillng a cholera epidemic, a person must not give way to fear and despair, which debilitate the system too much, allowing, thereby an easier entrance to the enemy. Tile best remedy against the weakeningo thoughts is a constant and vigoorous activity of body and mind, wlhich draws our attention away from disease and death to our duties and objects of life. Necessary, above all, is regularity in all our actions, in sleeping and waking'; moderation, but sufficiency [Page 400](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/402) 400 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACtI AND BOWELS. in eating and drinking. The most substantial nourishment is the best, such as beef, mutton, potatoes and bread; the best drink is cold water or ice-water, which, with dry bread in sufficient quantity, is the best calculated to appease tha clraving, and. gnawing appetite, and the rumbling of the bowels, which, in time of cholera, almost every one feels daily: A flannel bandage, even in summer, covering stomach and bowels, is strongly recommended. To be avoided, are; overexertions of body or mind, grief, anger, fear, as well as great muscular labor, running, walking to exhaustion, and sexual excesses. Beside these precautionary measures, every one ought to have a firm reliance in the will of God, who has placed within our reach a safe and sure remedy against this disease. The best medicine for prevention is SulphAur, which, in the thirtieth dilution, may be taken every week twice, six globules each time in the evening. This remedy, more than any other, destroys-, within the system the liability of attack, by diminishing the psoric diathesis, more or less inherent in every one. Cure of an Attack of Asiatic Cholera.- Not every diarrhea, in time of cholera, is real Asiatic cholera, yet it predisposes to it; and we must, therefore, immediately and energetically attend to it. The first and most imperious duty in such a diarrhea is to lie down; as the horizontal position is indispensable to a speedy cure. With the rice-water discharges or vomiting, commences the first stage of the disease, in which Camphor is the specific remedy, having actually the power of killing or destroying the animalcula or malignant agent which has infested the system. The application of the Camphor must be effectual and immediate, in the following manner-: Cover the patient, up to the chin, well and abundantly, particularly his feet, do not allow his arms out of bed; then give [Page 401](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/403) ASIATIC CHOLERA - CHOLERA ASIATICA. 40.4Ihim quietly, without showing anxiety by unnecessary hurry, of the tincture of Campohor,* every two, three, or five minutes, one drop, on a little piece of sugar; also, after fifteen or twenty minutes, some brandy and water, if he can retain anything on the stomach. As soon as the patient begins to get warm, and to perspire, give the doses less frequently, and discontinue them altogether when lie perspires fieely. A few doses of brandy and watcr will then do him good and strengthen him. In this perspiration the patient must remain without change for eight or ten hours, when lie will generally have a good appetite for a lunch of cold beef or mutton, with salt, dry bread and cold water. If, however, the slightest indisposition yet remains, he must not leave the bed, as a relapse might take place. During the reaction, following the use of the camphor, fiequently a headache ensues from congestion to the head, which in children and middle-aged persons disappears after the exhibition of one or two doses of Belladonna (for children three glob.; for adults six glob.); in aged persons, when stupor is combined with it, Secale corn. (thihtieth dilution) is yet necessary, three hours after Belladonna is given. If costiveness follows the use of camphor, a cup of coffee without milk, and twenty-four hours afterward a dose of Sul2lhur (six glob.) is indicated. If the diarrhea is not entirely checked, but changed into a dysenteric one, with straining and bloody tinge, lfercury will suffice, followed by Sul2phur, twenty-four or thirty-six hours afterward. If by the.Mercury, hlowever, the dysenteric stool is changed into the choleroic, the use of Ccanphor is necessary again, followed by one or two doses of Veratruum alb. (twelfth dilution). If, however, the cholera proceeds into the second stage, where cramps appear in different parts of the body, Veratrurn and Cuprumn are necessary; the former, when the cramps s The tincture of Camnphor ought to be made out of one part of the gam to five parts of alcohol. [Page 402](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/404) 402 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND BOWELS. are more in the extremities and bowels; the latter, when in the breast, or when great oppression in breathing is present. It is frequently best to give these two remedies alternately, in the following manner: Dissolve of each remedy twelve or sixteen globules, in four tablespoonfuls of water, and give every fifteen minutes a teaspoonful (each remedy having its separate teaspoon), giving less frequently as the symptoms decrease in violence. In this stage, it is not so much the diminution of diarrhea or vomiting, which indicates an amelioration, but the greater regularity and less rapidity of the pulse, which always will be followed by a discontinuance of the cramps, although these may yet threaten to break out again. If these remedies are not successful within four or six hours, or if the cramps are more in the calves of the legs, where the slightest motion will excite them, or when stupor threatens, which is particularly the case in old persons,- or when the diarrhea still continues, Secale corn. must be given, in the intervals of half an hour a teaspoonful dissolved in water like Veratrum and Cuprum. If a few doses are given, wait an hour or two, if the case does not grow worse; if, however, there is a great deal of nausea or retching, increased by motion of head or body, Tabacum (six glob.) must be given, at any time during the attack. If in this stage congestions to the lungs and heart appear, indicated by violent stitches in the side, almost preventing respiration, and producing restlessness and great anguish, give Cuprumn and Hydrocyanic acid (Prussic acid), in alternation, every ten or fifteen minutes a dose (dissolved in water, a teaspoonful as a dose. N. B. Prussic acid must be given in the second dilution). The covering of the patient during the second stage ought still to be warm, but already more according to the feeling of the patient; his drink, cold or warm water, left to his choice. Ice pills may be given to him freely, or injections of ice water if the bowels are cramped; rub slightly the cramped parts [Page 403](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/405) ASIATIC CHIOLERA - CHOLERA ASIATICA. 403 with the hands; warming bottles, and all the other heating apparatus heretofore applied, are not of much use, although a homceopathist may allow them as not interfering witlh his medicine. If the disease should go into the third stage (collapse) the scene and treatment change entirely. No pulse, livid countenance, hoarse voice, and sunken eyes characterize this period. Yet our hope is not gone; particularly in cases which, up to this stage were treated strictly homoeopathically, or where the disease ran quickly through the first stages. This period generally lasts much- longer than any of the former, and medicines must be given at longer intervals. The disease frequently stays in this stage for two or three days, almost unaltered; a slight improvement in the pulse is sometimes perceptible only within two days. In such cases, the medicine must not be changed or repeated often. The principal remedy is Carbo veg., in the thirtieth dilution, prepared as Veratrum above, of which for the first six hours, every hour a teaspoonful should be given. If a great deal of burning remains in the stomach, with drinking frequently, but little at a time, Arsenic, thirtieth dilution, prepared similarly, may be alternated with Carbo veg. But if thus four or six teaspoonfuls of each, remedy have been given, their use should be discontinued for ten or twelve hours-particularly if the pulse has shown evidence of returning during that time. The improvement of the pulse is, in this stage, the most important amelioration; the coldness of the surface is not of so much importance, as it often remains for a longer time without injury. If, after twelve hours, the patient's condition is not much improved, the same remedies may be repeated, and in this manner continued for a couple of days, when, in most cases a healthful reaction takes place. The covering, in this stage, must be altogrethler left to the feelings of the patient, and only so much put over him as decency requires, as the patient generally refuses all cover [Page 404](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/406) 404 AFFECTIONS OF TIHE STOMACH AND BOWELS. ins, and is restless. To try to warm patients in this stage by external means, is not only useless, but cruel; as they actually complain of burning up internally; such means only hasten dissolution. We rather recommend to wrap the patient in a sheet, wrung in cold water, which may, after a few hours, be repeated, if he desires it. But, in such a case, the patient ought to be covered beside with a blanket or two, to follow up the beginning reaction. Cold drinks, particularly ice water, are preferable in this stage. In the period of convalescence, which is usually very short, great care ought of course to be taken in diet and exerciserice and other gruels, afterward small quantities of broth, meat, and vegetables. If a typhoid fever appears, it must be treated accordingly. In that torpor or stupor which sometimes succeeds a severe attack of cholera, when the patient cannot easily be aroused, is very weak, pulse slow, yet the expression of his countenance is natural, Sjliritus nitri dulcis is of the greatest benefit, as laurocerasus is in those cases of stupor or lethargy, which border on paralysis of the brain, or on exhaustion of the nervous system, where the expression of the countenance is indicative of great suffering, the patient very weak, pulse slow, eyes half-closed, in continual lethargy, only broken by deep sighs and moaning. FURTHER REMARKIS. -If a cholera case has not been brought to a successful issue during the first two stages by the means already pointed out, it runs into the third or stage of collapse, the most dreadful and fearful state, which was hitherto considered almost invariably hopeless. But here also the genius of Hahnemann has triumphed over the most difficult obstacles; the scientific method which Homceopathy brought into the contest with this dreaded collapse of a cholera patient, has given us glorious results, and divested it of the greater part of the terror which heretofore attended it. Although the collapsed state is still the most dreaded in an attack of cholera, [Page 405](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/407) ASIATIC CHOLERA-CHOLERA ASIATICA. 405 yet it is not always incurable, and in many cases yields easier to the appropriate means, than severe attacks during the first stages. This is particularly the case, where the disease progresses rapidly (and the patient enters into the state of collapse, not very much exhausted by the protracted first stage of the attack. It very frequently occurs, that in a few hours the patient's pulse vanishes and the collapsed stage commences, without having lost much of the blood-serum by evacuations ori vomiting, or without having suffered much from cramps and that feeling of suffocation at the chest which weakens so much. In such calses when properly treated before and during collapse, a favorable result can be anticipated. In the hight of the epidemic of 1849, t observed three cases of this kind in one family; within a few hours, before help could arrive, a mother and two sons, had run into a perfect state of collapse; yet every one of them recovered, easier, I might say, than as if they had strugfgled for a long time in the first stage. They remained cold for two clays; at the end of the first day a faint pulse re-appeared, which increased gradually in volume and strength, until a normal action was attained, the follo ring action was not too great and subsided by degrees. These patients had received only Carbo vey., 30th dilution, every day from six to eight teaspoonfuls in solution, and no other medicine; for a drink nothing but rice water. As they did not exhibit symptoms of restlessness, I did not give ArseniC'1en, which otherwise I would have alternated with Carbo. In the epidemic of 1849 seventy-three cases of decided collapse were successfully treated, mainly by the administration of C.t rbo veg. This remedy seems to be the principal one, particularly, when the cheeks appear red, yet are cold and covered with clammy sweat. Arsenicum is indicated alone or in alternation with Ca rbo, if the patient is very restless, throws himself about continually and asks for drink continually. An important remedy before and during collapse is Secale coxrnttulm, particularly when the discharges of serum still con [Page 406](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/408) 406 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND BOWELS. tinue involuntary; the patient allows them to escape into the bed, without expressing the wish to be helped off from it; has still some cramps now and then, a sickish, squeamish feeling at the stomach, without vomiting, feels very much exbh-austed. In such cases this remedy in alternation w~ith T:\"rat ruti is indicated; I generally supplied both in the sixth potency. Secale is also the specific in that species of enceph:-I litis, which sometimes follows in the reactionary stage after collapse; it is distinguished by furious delirium, saying foolish things, and making violent efforts to get up; in such cases Caprurn alternates well, particularly when the patient is very restless, pulse full, strong and quick, and the eye injected. The opposite state of this sometimes occurs, particularly in old women, when stupor ensues, in which no remedy seems to be so efficacious, as Secale; if Camphor had been freely applied during the first stage, it ought to be alternated with Belladonna. The'most dangerous and critical state in the first stage of the cholera is perhaps when the patient all at once complains of stitches apparently in the pleura, mostly in the left side, in the region of the heart; he is bathed at the same time with a profuse perspiration, alternately warm and cold, his thirst is unquenchable; his whole behavior is that of one in the greatest agony. In such cases I found ilydrocyanlic acid the onily remedy, which relieved promptly; if occasional cramps in the abdomen xere connected with this state, I would alternate it with Calpruim, but most gave it alone in the second potency, every two or three minutes, a teaspoonful of the solution, until better. Perhaps never have I witnessed a more prompt and immediate action of any medicine, than that of lydrocyanic acid in this fearful state; it acted indeed like a charm. But the remedy must be prepared carefully according to the strictest rules of our Pharmacopoeia. Another dangerous state, after the cholera has disappeared, is when the patient appears perfectly listless, and apathetic, does not answer questions, does not seem to understand or hear [Page 407](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/409) ASIATIC CHOLERA-CHOLERA ASIATICA. 407 you; pulse and weak. Smelling on Spiritus nitri dulcis, and a few doses of it internally in solution, will arouse his sensibilities and avert all danger. Before we leave this subject, I will draw yet the attention to the efficacy of Laurocerasus in those cases after collapse, where the patient, seemingly conscious when aroused, drops easily back into a sleep; face red, hot, pulse hard but sluggish; it is a state where 01)iuzm seems to be indicated, where it, however, will seldom be of use. During collapse I have generally avoided all external applications; those of a heating nature are positively injurious, distressing the poor sufferer, who already complains of insufferable internal heat beyond endurance; heated bricks, bottles, etc., are perfect torments to them, exhausting the little vitality, still struggling internally against the disease. Gentle rubbings with the hand under a light cover are however very beneficial; it quiets and strengthens the patients. Hahnemann was decidedly right in recommending to mesmerize patients when in a state of collapse. Rubbing with a cloth, dipped in icewater, with gentle dry-rubbing after it, is also very beneficial; it ought to be repeated fiequently, say every half hour; the patient must be slightly covered after it. If salt, as much as the water will dissolve, is put into the ice-water with which the patient is to be rubbed, it will increase the.possibility of a speedier reaction in the peripheric nervous system-the vomiting and squeamishness is frequently relieved by small draughts of salt water-it induces quick reaction. Salt water will be an important remedy in cholera. A very peculiar and most dangerous metastasis of the cholera miansm to the brain in the form of paralysis, presented itself in the epidemic of 1854, to my observation and treatment. A girl of about 18 years of age, was attacked with Asiatic Cholera in a most violent manner, and before I could see her ran into collapse; when I arrived she had lost sight, hearing and speech, though she would drink the water pre [Page 408](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/410) 408 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACII AND BOWELS. sented to her very eagerly, but would eject again immediately. I at once put her into a hot bath, and injected by a pump, at least four quarts of cold water; at the same time she drank as much as possible. Vomiting ceased, sight, hearing and speech returned, pulse re-appeared, and the girl was saved. Sulla)hur frequently takes away that disposition to diarrhea, so common in times of cholera. It ought to be talen only twice on two succeeding evenings, or one evening and the next morning a dose (six glob.); after which no medicine of any kind should be taken for twenty-four or forty-eight hours. We would recommend to every one, to have with him, in cholera times, *a small bottle of Canmphlor, Teratrzum and (Juprum, in case of need; if not necessary, it certainly increases the feeling of safety.': * In the cholera epidemic of 1849, which raged in Cincinnati worse, perhaps, than in any other city of the same size, every homceopathic family was provided with a small case of four vials, containing Camphor, Veratrum, Cuprum, and Sulphur, as the principal remedies for the prevention and cure of cholera. Printed directions accompanying these remedies enabled persons to make immediate use of them, when necessary; thus preventing entirely the application of allopathic medicines before the horuceopathic physician could arrive. These simple but effective means kept the homceopathic practice free from many obstacles and difficulties, and made its results so glorious, and, even in the history of Homceopathy, unrivaled. The average loss which was sus.. tained by the homnopathic practice, in 1849, amounted to only three and a half per cent., viz: of 2410 patients treated homnceopathically, 85 were lost. In 1850 the attack of cholera in Cincinnati was not so severe; the cases generated not so much by epidemic influence as by indigestion, and other weakening causes. Such cases, however, were more difficult to manage, as the exciting cause could not be so easily removed, being of a material nature; yet the same homceopathic medicines proved entirely successful; even more so, in the aggregate, than the previous year. The loss, of patients treated by us during that time, was not more than three per cent.; the ratio of other practitioners, as nearly as could be ascertained, was about the same. The above description and treatment of Asiatic cholera is carefully made after our own experiences during these two epidemics, in which nearly two thousand cholera patients were attended by us. [Page 409](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/411) ASIATIC 409 rXrbuttt f HAHNEMANN. REFLECTIONS AND STATISTICS ON ASIATIC CHOLERA. Not the least among the thousands of wonderful facts and events brought about by the discovery of Homceopathy, which either as miraculous cures, blessed the world of affliction, or which, as newly discovered laws astonished and enlightened the world of science, is that grand and noble instance when Hlahuemann pointed, with boldness and correctness, to the very remedies, which should and did successfully combat that awful disease, the cholera, although he never had seen himself a cholera patient as yet, but had only read a description of the symptoms. This act of Hlahnemann's was at once the most splendid refutation against all that his enemies had said, and against all that they might say afterward. It was a practical vindication of the truth of real science, such as the world heretofore had never witnessed, and which since has not been surpassed; it is scarcely equaled by the mathematical demonstration of Le Verrier as to the existence of Neptune, before the eye of an Astronomer had caught this planet in its course through the illmmense depths of the heavens. In both instances, we see the eye of science precede the observation to be made by the external senses, and judge with such accuracy and precision truly wonderful and imposing. The mind in the common pursuits of life, drudging along and becoming wearied from the endless toil, refreshes by contemplating such deeds of scientific valor; it is inspired by new strength from above; it believes again that toil and research is not in vain, and that a still more glorious future shall follow the present, which is found worthy to produce such giants in intellect. There Hahnemann sat in his little cabinet, before him the reports of the physicians, sent out to Russia to reconnoitre the 35 [Page 410](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/412) 410 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMIACH AND BOWELS. movements and character of that dreadful enemy, the cholera. He watched with care, its slightest motions, not a symptorm escaped his eye. With the key he hal discovered, he now was prepared to unlock the mystery; on this solemn moment hung the life of thousands of his fellow creatures; he knew it, he was sensible of it, but he did not tremble, did not shrink, where duty of such exalted a nature was presented to hiitm. IHere was a test, so awfully grand, given into his handls, that an ordinary mind might have been crushed under its wei ht. Not so Hahnemann. The occasion so weighty, buoys hirm up; he feels his duty, but also the inspiring influence of a heavenly reward in the distance, and his genius towers iglher and highel:, until it lights the Promethean torch, which is henceforth to guide and save millions of struggling and dying mortals. \\We may say, Hahnemann had reached, in this act, the clllminatin g point of his greatness, although not of his usefulness. No act of his after life could compare in magnitude and grandeur, with the discovery of the remedies against cholera, nor could any thing that he afterward developed, evince greater tact or sagacity. That done, and lie commenced a new era in the history of medicine; the healing art had at once become a scwience, noble, more elevating, more humanitary than any other;-medicine had found combined in him a Luther and a Bacon; who wonders now that she has progressed, so fast and rapidly toward perfection. Two severe epidemics of cholera have tested to a perfect demonstration, the correctness of Hahnemann's bold predictions: Caapvhor, TVercttrtm, and Cuprumn are yet the prbinc'ipal remedies against cholera; no others can compare with these three, in general applicability. And how have the results crowned his brows with the laurels of success! Compare the Homceopathic with the Allopathic statistics. The comparison is so much in favor of Homeeopa. thic treatment, that if the same results had not been gained in thousands of places, and in different parts of the globe, one might doubt, at the first glance the truth of the statement. [Page 411](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/413) ASIATIC CHIOLERA-CHOLERINA. 411 All the Allopathic statistics, from Russia to the furthest corner of America, show an average loss of from fifty to eighty per cent., while the Homoeopathic statistics, procured from the sname lhlces, show only an average loss of from three to ten per cent. lMany of us will yet recollect the thrill of joy and exultinig tIlcasurc, which ran through this nation from one end of the land to the other, when after the first season of the cholera (184-49), it was experienced and known, that Homceopathy had b)_cen incomparably more successful than any other medical system. In the prevctionl as well as the care of this most dfcadilul of all diseases, it had shown itself the most effective and reliable system. During this time of unspeakable suffering and distress, lHomoeopathy had gloriously and convincingly vindicated its merciful divine origin. Hahnemann's name shone in those days bright and glorious; around his memory gathered of itself a glorious wreath of the people's own voluntary thanks and blessing \u2014a homage rendered to genius and philanthropy, willingly and readily. What a man! what a science! what a testimony! CHOLERINA. We must mention here yet a disease, called Cholerina, which often precedes and follows cholera. It is a diarrhea of fecal matter, accompanied with rumbling of the bowels, generally caused by the constitutionality of a cholera season, under debilitating influences of mind and body, such as fear and grief. If caused by the latter, Phosphoric acid and Ohina, in alternation, after every evacuation a dose (six glob.), will suffice; if excited by fear, Chamomile (six glob.), a few doses; if, however, attended with bilious rheumatic symptoms, tending toward a typhoid state, Bryonia and Rhus, in alternation, two doses of each, every two hours one (six glob. a dose), and then waiting twenty-four hours, will change the symptoms, so that then either Sulphur will suit, or, if the diarrhea still continues, China and Phosphoric acid, in alternation, as above stated. [Page 412](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/414) 412 AFFECrIONS OF THE STOMACII AND BOWELS. PILES. HIEMORRIIOIDS. DIAGNOsIs.-The piles form on the anus tumors or lumps, which protrude externally (external piles), or remain inside the rectum (internal piles). These lumps either bleed (open piles) or do not bleed (blind piles). The cause of the piles is a constitutional taint, which breaks out at certain times in this local affection of the rectum, and is then called the piles. It becomes an important disease, when a bad, or mere external treatment suppresses the outward piles, without curing the internal disposition. This latter, consequently, not unfrequently attacks more important organs, such as the lungs, brain, etc., where it generates incurable diseases. Just as detrimental to general health is the painful and abominable practice of the surgeons, of cutting off these lumps or tumors. It is a blessing, however, that in most cases such operations are of no avail. CAvsES.-The use of strong and heating drinks, coffee, liquors, highly-seasoned food, sedentary habits, costiveness, suppression of long-continued discharges, etc., are among the exciting causes of this disease, and ought, consequently, to be strictly avoided in its treatment. TREATMENT.-In all cases of piles, begin the treatment with iVux vomica, as the principal remedy, which suits for all varieties of this complaint. After it, particularly in chronic cases, alternately with it, give Sulphur. These two remedies are mostly sufficient to effect a cure; given alternately, every evening a dose (four glob.) until better. If they do not suffice, give of the following remedies, Ignatia, Sepia, Belladonna, Hepar, Colocynth, one after the other, in intervals of twenty-four or forty-eight hours. The cure of chronic piles must be directed by a skillful homceopathic physician; as there are too many and too various constitutional considerations to be observed, which could not be given in a work like this. [Page 413](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/415) ITCHING OF THE ANUS \u2014FALLING OF THE BODY. 413 APPLICATION OF WATER ill this disease is of the greatest benefit. It is generally sufficient during a homceopathic treatment to direct the patient to make use of the sitting-bath, the cold bandage around the abdomen, and injections of cold water to remove constipation; beside, advise him to drink freely of cold water. DIET AND REGIMEN.-The same as stated in the article \"Constipation.\" ITCHING OF THE ANUS. If it occurs in children, it is caused by the so-called pinworms (see \"Ascarides\"). In such Veratrum, Ipecac, other evening a dose (three glob.) of one remedy for one week, until better or another remedy is necessary. If this course is insufficient, give the child every morning, for several days, a drop of the tincture of Urtica urens, in a little water. If caused by piles, uitx vomica and Ignatia are the principal remedies, given as stated under the heading \"Piles.\" Beside these medicines, the washing or sponging in cold water, or even cold water injections are of the greatest benefit. Sometimes sweet oil, used in the same manner as the water, will be of use. FALLING OF THE BODY. PROLAPSUS ANI. By this term is meant the protrusion of a portion of the lower intestine or rectum. It occurs more frequently in children than adults, caused by severe strainings when at stool. The rectum can easily be brought back again by a gentle pressure of the thumb and fore-finger, greased or oiled for that occasion, the patient bending forward during the operation, and reclining on his back after it. We have remedies which diminish the tendency to this troublesome disease. TREATMENT. \u2014Ignatia is the principal remedy, and must be given once in twenty-four hours (four glob.) for six or eight days; then discontinue eight days, and if not better, give [Page 414](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/416) 414 AFFECTIONS OF TIlE STOMACH AND BOWELS. MAercury, in the same manner. A fter that, iVux vomica, and Su.lphur, in the same manner, until better. Sepia, Iycopodinm, Colocynth, are also suitable to be given, if necessary, in the same manner. Externally, wash with cold water, and make frequent use of the sitting-bath, as stated in \"Piles.\" DIET AND REGIMEN.-AS in \"Diarrhea.\" If this treatment is of no avail, consult a homceopathic physician. RUPTURE. HERNIA. A protrusion or swelling in the inguinal region or groin, generally indicates a rupture, by which the intestines descend, thus forming the outward swelling. As a disease of such consequence and importance is beyond the sphere of an exhausting discussion in a domestic work, we must limit our remarks about a few dangerous points, to which the disease may run at times, leaving the treatment of the rupture itself to the combined efforts of the surgeon and homceopathic physician, who must be consulted. Sometimes an incarceration of the rupture takes place, when the tumor becomes very painful, inflammation in the surrounding parts ensues, with vomiting, quick and hard pulse, and fever. If the rupture cannot be brought back, or the inflammation reduced by other means, mortification and consequent death are unavoidable. First try the reduction in the following manner: place the patient on his back on the bed, grasping the swelling with one hand gently, and rub and press it with the fingers of the other hand, pressing upward toward the body constantly, sometimes even in a rotary manner. Continue these efforts for half an hour; if the swelling is repressed, keep it in its place with the palm of the hand for some time, giving, beside, tile following medicines: Aconite. If the fever is very higl. J.2x vomica, followed in two hours by [Page 415](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/417) DROPSY OF TIlE ABDOMEN. 415 Opium. If the stranyg-llation of the rupture continues, and afterward in alternation with:AYtux vomnica until better. Also, LZcliesis, Belladonna, Rhus, Arsenic, TVeratrum, can be given in extreme cases, if necessary; one after the other, every two hours one remedy, until better. APPLICATION OF WATER.-Cold injections are frequently of the greatest benefit in incarcerated rupture, as also the application of cold water or ice, even in the most desperate cases. ADMINISTRATION.-Dissolve of the necessary remedy twelve globules in half a teacupful of water; give every fifteen or thirty minutes a teaspoonful, for two hours, or until better. DIET AND REGIMEN.-As in fevers. Complete rest in a horizontal position is indispensable, and a truss must not be worn until all soreness has subsided. DROPSY OF THE ABDOMEN. (Asciies.) As this is one of those diseases which require a most skillful medical attendance, in order to secure a successful termination, we cannot pretend to give more than what is necessary to a knowledge of its rise and progress. This will enable persons to be aware of the danger in time to seek for help, when it is yet possible to render it successfully. DIAGNosIs.-A swelling and tension of the abdomen, which follows the position of the patient; a fluctuation inside the abdomen is distinctly felt by the palm of one hand while clapping gently against one side, when the other hand presses the opposite side of the abdomen, in the lowest part of which the fluctuation is felt the strongest, while the patient is standing erect. Urine is scanty, brown like beer (peculiar to ascites); stools are scanty and dry; also, the skin, tongue, and mouth dry; when the water is collected in a sack (hydrops saccatus), the swelling is unequal in the beginning; the urine less scarce and brown. As the disease progresses, the feet and other parts swell successively; fever and dry cough appear, which [Page 416](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/418) 416 AFFECTIONS OF TIIE STOMACI- AND BOWELS. consume the strength more and more, until death ends the misery. CAUSES.-AS such, we find previous acute fevers, scarlet or other eruptions, diseases of important abdominal organs, especially the liver, badly treated, intermittents of too long standing, which debilitate the absorbing vessels, gout, abuse of spiritous liquors, mechanical lesions, such as blows on the abdomen, falls, etc. This disease sometimes lasts very long, according to the causes, and the constitution of the patient. A pregnancy, not closely watched in its progress, may be mistaken for a dropsy of the abdomen; but, in such a case, a skillful physician must decide. TREATMNIENT.-AS this disease can be cured, if early attended to in the right manner, we recommend every one to apply immediately to a good physician. Until one can be procured, give, Arsenic and Sulphur, in alternation, every four days one dose (six glob.), followed by ilpis myellif in the same manner The tapping may be allowed in cases where the accumulation of water is very rapid; but no one must trust in it as a curative means; the necessary internal treatment must therefore be continued, until cured entirely. DIET AND REGIMEN.-As in all chronic diseases, the usual homceopathic diet. EXTERNAL INJURIES OF THE ABDOMEN. On receiving large wounds in the abdomen, do not despair immediately, as a great many are cured who received the severest cuts and shots in the abdomen, if only properly treated. Clean the wound with lukewarm water, and replace the intestines as soon as possible, handlingo them not with the hands, but with clean linen cloths. If the patient is faint, from loss of blood, give China; if fiightened, Coffea, and afterward Arnica. Sew up the wound carefully a silken j ____ __~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~_ __ 1~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ [Page 417](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/419) EXTERNAL INJURIES OF TIlE ABDOMEN. 417 thread waxed, leaving an opening on the lowest corner, which must be covered witlh scraped linen, dipped in a mixture of Arnica (twelve drops to a teacupful of water). If diarrhea ensues, give Colocyvlth alternately with C/dina. If a child has swallowed a button, or any other metal substance, do not give it aperient medicine, in the hope of purginmg it out of the system more quickly; this is impossible; on the contrary, the substance will come out less quickly, as the liquid state of the faeces prevents them fiom carrying it along. In the meantime, observe carefully each stool to be sure that the substance has passed. If a needle is swallowed, it may work itself through a different part of the body; in such a case, give Silicea, every six days a dose (four glob.). If live animals are swallowed, such as frogs, insects, etc., let the patient drink plenty of sweet oil. [Page 418](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/420) CHAPTER XV. AFFECTIONS OF THE URINARY AND GENITAL ORGANS. WE invite the special attention of our readers to the study of the anatomical position and structure, as well as the physiological bearing, of the organs named in the above heading, as it will be important for the true diagnosis of their diseases, which are various and severe. INFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEYS. ('tep2hrl\"iis.) DIAGNOSIS. - In the region of the kidneys (on both sides of the spine, above the hip, and below the short ribs), appears a pungent, pressing pain, shooting downward to the bladder; difficulty of urination; stranguria, or ischuria (the latter only when both kidneys are inflamed, which rarely ever occurs); the urine scanty, red, and hot, sometimes blood; the testicle drawn near to the abdomen on the affected side, painful and swollen; the foot on the same side sometimes spasmodically affected and benumbed; in severer cases, high fever, thirst, full hard pulse, constipation, vomiting; colic pains; the pains in the kidney are worse when lying on the affected part and the back; also when standing and walking. If this inflammation is not cured entirely, the kidney hardens and indurates, or suppuration takes place, which leads to the formation of abscesses and their opening, either outside through the skin, or inside in the intestinal canal. This (418) [Page 419](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/421) INFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEYS. 419 chronic affection of the kidneys requires medical skill for its successful termination. The principal causes are: stones or gravel in the kidney; violent blows and concussions, or any other external injury bearing on this part; excess in the use of wines and liquors; lying on the back for a long time; lifting heavy loads; suppression of piles, and their congestion transferred to the kidney; the use of acrid diuretics and the abuse of Spanish fly, sometimes even when only applied as a blister, externally. TREATMENT. \u2014 Camphor, when the disease is caused by the application or use of Spanish fly (canthlaris), or when no urine passes or only in a slender stream very slowly, with burning in the urethra and bladder. Give in such a case one or two drops of Camphor spirits, on a lump of sugar, every hour or two hours, until better. Aconite. If the fever is high, give several doses (four glob. each) of this remedy, every hour one, before the following remedies are resorted to. Cantharis is the principal medicine, when there are shooting, tearing, and incisive pains, painful emission of afew drops of urine only, or complete ischuria; sometimes urine mixed with blood. Belladonna. In most cases, where the pains are worse periodically, shooting from the kidney down into the bladder, with great anguish and colic; in fleshy women, at the time of change of life (critical age), when the menses stop. (Hepar sulpA. will suit after Belladonna). NXux vomica. When this disease is caused by suppressed piles, or when there is any other abdominal congestion, with tension, distension, and pressure in the kidney. Pulsatilla. In delicate females, whose menses have stopped or are very scanty; also, when the urine appears turbid, leaving a purulent sediment. Arnica, externally and internally, if caused by external injuries; after it the above remedies may be resorted to. [Page 420](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/422) 420 AFFECTIONS OF TIlE URIINARY AND GENITAL ORGANS. N. B. If nephritis is caused by the pressure of stones in the kidneys, the fever which usually accompanies this disease does not appear so quickly, but, instead of it, the foot and thigh of the affected side become numb, and the testicle retracts; sure signs of stones in the kidneys or the ureter. In such a case apply on the most painful spot, where the stone is lodged, narcotic, warm fomentations of hops mixed with tobacco leaves; as soon as the stone or gravel reaches, in its descent, the bladder, the pains and inflammation caused by them cease at once. Beside this external treatment, give the patient the above medicines, as indicated. If the kidney indurates, which is known by the patient complaining of a sensation of weight in the loins or sometimes by a feeling of numbness in the foot of the side affected, give Jercury, every evening a dose (four glob.). If suppuration takes place, which is known by a sensation of heaviness, accompanied by throbbing in the region of the kidney (the latter symptom ceases when the matter, mixed with blood, is discharged with the urine), give Lachesis and ljepar alternately, every evening a dose (four glob.), for eight days, or until better; apply to a homceopathic physician. ADMINISTRATION. - Dissolve, of the necessary medicine, twelve globules in half a teacupful of water, and give every half-hour, hour, or two hours, a teaspoonful until better, or until another remedy is needed. APPLICATION OF WATER. -Tepid sitting-baths, frequently repeated, will accelerate the cure and support the effect of the proper homceopathic remedies. DIET AND REGIMEN, as in fevers generally; but particularly wines, liquors, and beer are prohibited in convalescence. INFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER. (Cystitis.) DIAGNOSIS.-Burning pains in the region of the bladder, with external swelling; tension; heat and pain on touch; urnne red and a hard pulse; in some cases, vomiting and hiccough. The issue of this inflammation is either resolution, indicated by a thick urine, or suppuration discharged with the urine, or abscesses and fistulas from the bladder outside, or induration, which leads to a thickening of the bladder, impeding, thereby, its action, and leading to various chronic disorders; or, if fatal, gangrene takes place. Its causes can be external injuries; suppressed piles and retarded menstruation; rheumatic, gouty, or syphilitic transfers; stones in the bladder; pressure on the bladder in pregnancy, or during the birth of the child; the use of irritating drugs, as Cantharides, etc. TREATMENT. - Beside the remedies recommended in \"Inflammation of the Kidneys,\" give Hyoscyamus, when spasms of the neck of the bladder set in, impeding the flow of urine. Carbo veyetabilis and Arsenicum, when the patient complains very much of burning during urination, which Cantharides failed to cure. D)ulcamara, when this disease returns on the slightest exposure to cold. Sulphur and Calcarea, when the disease becomes chronic. ADMINISTRATION, APPLICATION OF WATER, DIET AND -REGIMEN, the same as in \" Nephritis.\" STRANGURY, DYSURY, ISCHURY, AND ANURY. These four terms signify only different degrees of the same affection. In strangury, the discharge of urine is painful and diicult. In dysury, djicult and incomplete. In ischury and anury, it is totally suppressed. Strangury and dysury are troublesome, but not dangerous complaints, while the true ischury, or total retention of urine, ranks among the most dangerous diseases, and kills, either [Page 422](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/424) 422 AFFECTIONS OF THE URINARY AND GENITAL ORGANS. by gangrene or rupture of the bladder, effusing the urine into the abdomen; in its chronic form, however, the urine can be absorbed and carried into the circulation, producing, thereby, eruptions on the skin, and making the perspiration, saliva, etc., smell urinous. The causes of these affections are various. Mechanical injuries or impediments, such as gravel, stones, callosities and strictures, spasmodical, or caused by syphilitic disorders; tumors in these parts; falling of the womb, or its dislocation; congestion of every kind; paralysis of the bladder; the use of ardent spirits, Spanish fly, violent diuretics, etc. TREATMENT. - For strangury, and dysury, if caused by the abuse of ardent spirits, Nux vom., Pulsatilla, and Sulphur; if by the use of Spanish fly, Ca.mph., Puls., Apis mel., Acon.; if by suppressed piles, izux vomn., Puilstailla, Sulphur; Acon.; if after a fall, blow, etc., Arnica; if in pregnant females, Cocculus, Pull. the Kidneys\" (.Vephlritis). APPLCATION OF WATER; beside the frequent use of sittingbaths of a cool temperature, it will be beneficial to cover the parts affected with wet bandages during the time between the sitting-baths. DIET AND REGIMEN the same as in nephritis; beside this, in strangury the drinking of large quantities of cold water, or bhe moderate use of gum-arabic, dissolved in water, is strongly recommended. In cases of disease of the bladder, consult, as soon as possible, a homceopathic physician. [Page 423](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/425) INCONTINENCE OF URINE. 423 INCONTINENCE OF URINE. (Enuresis, incontinentia urince.) This troublesome disease exists in three varieties: 1. It is a comnplete or paralytic incontinence of urine (enuresis completc s. paralytica), when the patient is constantly troubled with an involuntary dribbling of urine, owing to a variety of causes, all having the tendency to paralyze, more or less, the contractive power of the muscles around the neck of the bladder. Instances of this kind are; apoplexy; con. sumption, and paralysis of the spine; too great distension of the bladder by long retention of the urine; surgical operations on the bladder; paralysis, or weakness of the bladder, particularly in old acge; difficult and hard parturitions. This form of incontinence of urine requires the most careful attention of a homceopathic physician. We only mention some of the principal reinedies for this form of enuresis, with which a be commenced: Hyoscyamus, Belladonna, Causticum, Coninum, Arsenic, spasmodic incontinence of urine (enuresis incompleta s. spastica), where the urgency to pass urine is so sudden and great, that the patient is immediately forced to yield. This form occurs very frequently, caused by continual irritation in the bladder, or some contiguous part, either by stones, gravel, worms (ascarides), (see \"Worms\"); menstrual or hemorrhoidal congestion; gastric derangement, with or complication; in the bladder, rectum, prostate glands; ulcers, fistulas; also, from mechanical pressure of the pregnant or dislocated uterus (see \" Diseases of Females\"); or, lastly, by the bad habit of urinating too frequently, diminishing, thereby, the size of the bl adder. The principal remedies remedy in \" Materia Mldica.\") ADMINISTRATION of these medicines as in nephritis. [Page 424](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/426) 424 AFFECTIONS OP THE URINARY AND GENITAL ORGANS. 3. The urine escapes involuntarily only in the night (wetting the bed), (enuresis nocturna). This occurs mostly in children, and depends on bad habits, uncorrected in early years, or on local irritations, such as worms (see this article), or other derangements, enumerated under the form No. 2 (see their treatment). If it is a bad habit, try to correct it, by diminishing, the quantity of drink allowed in the evening, by laying the child on its side while asleep, by awakening it several times during the night in order to pass urine, or even by chastisement in the morning, the effects of which will be remembered, even in the sleep. Beside, use the following remedies: Silicea, every third evening a dose (three glob.), for two weeks; if not better, Sepia in the same manner; if not better. Sulphur, Arsenic, Carbo veg. in the same manner, one after the other. APPLICATION OF WAVTER; the cold sitting-bath in the morning, and in the evening a. cold sponge-bath are beneficial auxiliar'es in the treatment of the above diseases. DIABETES. DIAGNOSIS.-Any secretion of urine, the excessive increase of which has a weakening, morbific effect on the whole system, may be called a diabetes; although the quality of the urine be not altered, its appearance shows that it contains more water, it being colorless (nervous urine); cases of this kind either correct themselves, or are in connection with hysteric or hypochondriacal diseases, the cure of which will, also, take away this form of diabetes. But where the urine is not, or not much, increased in quantity, however changed. in quality, having a sweetish taste, and containing saccharine (sugar) matter (diabetes melitus), as high as an ounce in a pound, it is necessary to institute an early and earnest treatment for this disease, which, in its commencement, can be cured easily, and only becomes fatal by neglect. But, as such [Page 425](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/427) PILES OF THE BLADDER. 425 a complaint is too important in its progress and issue to be treated domestically, we here only indicate the remedies, with which a rational treatment may be commenced. TREATrMENT.-Phosp/horic acid, Carbo veg., Coniumz, iekercury, Slphur. rThe first of these medicines is almost a specific, as also the two last ones, which may be given in alternation; give, every evening, a dose (four glob.), for one week, and then wait a week for its effects. APPLICATION OF WATER; the sitting-baths used in this disease must be made of water with the chill taken off; beside these, the wet bandage around the abdomen, changed at least twice a day, is recommended; the patient is advised to drink large quantities of cold water. DIET.-Only bread, roasted meats, and soups of meat, are allowed; no vegetables whatever; the patient must keep in an even temperature. PILES OF THE BLADDER. (Hemorrhoides Vesicce.) As the pile disease consists in a congestion, which can tend to any part of the system, and produce piles, where the nature of the attacked organ admits of it, it is not strange to speak of piles of the bladder, because this organ allows the same disorganization, in this respect, as the rectum. They are also either blind, or open, running piles. DIAGNOSIS.-If they are blind, or not running, they create great difficulty in making water, strangury, ischury, sometimes spasms, and inflammations of the bladder (see these articles), with consequent induration and suppuration. If they are open, running piles, the blood coagulates in the bladder, obstructs the passage of urine, and may contribute to the formation of stones. TREATMENrT.-Constllt a homceopathic physician, if possible. If not, use the following remedies: Nuhx vomica, Pulsatilla, Sedplhur, beside all those recommended in the articles on strangury and isc/ury, in the same manner as there stated. 36 [Page 426](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/428) 426 AFFECTIONS OF THE URINARY AND GENITAL ORGANS. APPLICATION OF WATER; the frequent use of the sittingbath and the drinking of cold water will be beneficial. POLYPUS OF THE BLADDER. The neck of the bladder is the place most favorable to the generation of this kind of fleshy excrescences, where they occasion frequent obstructions in urinating, producing similar symptoms to those exhibited in piles, and stones of the bladder. Their existence, however, is rendered beyond doubt, as soon as fleshy particles of a round form, with a stringy substance attached to them, pass from the bladder; females are subject to them more than males. TREATMENT.-If possible, consult a homceopathic physician for this disease, as the cure depends too much on constitution to make a prescription of remedies, for a domestic work of this kind, possible. To commence the treatment, however, give Calcarea carb., every third or fourth evening a dose (four glob.), for four or six weeks. N. B. I once cured polypus of the bladder with Chamomile; the case was a complicated one, where the concomitant symptoms strongly advised its use. No other remedies had been used before; after the exhibition of Chamomile, the polypus passed off altogether. Staphysag. is recommended after Calcarea carb., in the same manner APPLICATION OF WATER; the frequent use of the sittingbath will support the effect of the proper homceopathic remedies. GRAVEL AND STONE IN THE BLADDER. (Calculus.) DIAGNOSIS. \u2014It is sometimes very difficult to be certain of the existence of a stone in the bladder, as it produces all the symptoms recorded under strangury, ischury, and piles of the bladder. (See these diseases.) The only sure guide in establishing a true diagnosis, is the [Page 427](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/429) HEMIORRHIAGE W'IT THE URINE. 427 examination by a competent physician or surgeon. In gravel, the diagnosis is easier, as some of it will pass, from time to time, clearly showing the nature of the disease. TREATMENT. \u2014The treatment for a stone in the bladder can not be given here, as such a disease must not be left to domestic practice. The best remedy for gravel is Sarsapcrilla, either in a homceopathic preparation (four glob.), or, if not at hand, of the tincture of Sarsaparilla, every evening one drop on sugar, until better. Beside this remedy, those stated under \" Strangury\" are recommended. HEMORRHAGE WITH THE URINE. ( Hoematuria. ffictus cruentus.) DIAGNosIs.-The blood comes with the urine, either mixed with it, like dark beer (then it proceeds from the kidneys, hcrnaturia renalis), or it is separated from the urine, coagulatedi (then it comes from the bladder (ha/maturia vesicalis), or the blood comes alone, without urinating (then it proceeds from the urethra, stymatosis). In the first case, pains are felt in the region of the kidneys; in the second, the region of the bladder is painful; and in the third case, the pains are in the urethra. CAsEs. \u2014This disease occurs always in consequence of other diseases, already located there, to which we refer the reader. These are: inflammation of the kidneys and bladder, and their causes, mechanical and external, stones and gravel, strangury, etc. TREATMENT. \u2014The principal remedies are: China, Ipecac., Arnica, PAldsatilla, Lycopodium, to be given as stated under \" Strangury.\" AFFECTIONS OF THE PENTS. If the front of the penis-the glans and the prepuce-is inflamed, red, and swollen, give, when caused by friction, Aconite and Arnica, in alternation, every two or three hours a [Page 428](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/430) 428 AFFECTIONS OF TIlE URINAiRY AND GENITAL ORGALS. dose (four glob., infants half a dose), until better; keep quiet on thie bed or a couchl; abstain f'omr all meat diet, and bathe, if necessary, with cold watlelr alone, or water and milk; if caused by want of cleanliness, give Alconzite (four glob.), alone, and bathe. If it was caused by the touch of poisonous plants, give, in the same manner, Belladonna and 2Rhus, after Aconite has been given. If a burning discharge appears from the urethra., give ~lercury, and if not better in twentyfour or thirty-six hours, give Ccapsicum, and in a few days after, flepar; if the parts become hardened, callous, and bluish, give Lachesis and Arsenic, in alternation. DIET AND REGIMEN.-Nothing but milk and water, dry toast, and gruels. N. B. For syphilitic disorders, chancres, and gonorrhea, see these articles. AFFECTIONS OF THE TESTICLES. kIflcammation, with painful swelling of the testicles, from.External injuries: Aconite and Arnica, as above, under Penis;\" Arnica, also, externally. Gonorrhea suppressed: and above; Mercury, Metastasis of the mzumps: see this disease; Pulsatilla is the principal remedy; also, Mercury and Nux vom. Abuse of Calomel: Pulsatilla and Carbo veg., in alternation, as above. If necessary give Sulphur after the above remedies have ameliorated, but not altogether cured. DIET AND REGIMEN as in \"Affections of the Penis.\" Iydrocele, or dropsy of the scrotum: if in infants shortly after the birth, wash with a mixture of six drops of Arnica tincture, in a teacupful of water, three or four times a day; if in older children, the same, externally, and Pulsatilla, every evening a dose (three glob.) internally; if in adults, Pulsatilla, Silicea, Sulphur, each eight or twelve [Page 429](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/431) SYPHILIS - GONORRHEA. 429 days, every fourth day a dose (four glob.) during that period, untii better, and if not, apply to a honeopathic physician. Diet and regimen as usual in chronic diseases, when treated homceopathically. SEMINAL WEAKNESS. ( Pollution. Impotence. Onania.) These diseases are very weakening, and frequently fatal to happiness, health, and even life. As their introduction here would carry us beyond the sphere of a domestic treatise, we advise our readers not to neglect, for a single day, the above complaints, which explain their nature in their names, but to hasve the advice of a skillful homceopathic physician at once. ERUPTIONS ON THE GENITAL ORGANS. Eruptions on the glans; Bryonia, Rhzus; on the hairy part, Phosphoric acid; on the prepuce, TRATION.-Every evening a dose (four glob.), and thus every medicine used for four days, before another one is commenced; if it is not better, wash with a solution (twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water) of the same remedy during its internal use. DIET AND REGIMEN as in chronic diseases. Erysipelas of the scrotum requires Belladonna, Rhus, and Arsenic, in the same manner as stated under \"Erysipelas.\" (See \"Diseases of the Skin.\") Diet and regimen as in \"Erysipelas.\" SYPHILIS.- GONORRHEA. We can only mention here the commencement of the treatment for these complaints, as inveterate or chronic disorders of this kind are so complicated and difficult of treatment, as to require the utmost attention of a skillful homceopathic physician:r-;sii~~~~~~~~~~~~~~;:'r~~~~~~~i~~~'~~'~~~~~~~~~~~~; i~~~~~n AND GENITAL ORGANS. a. Syphilis. Chancre. If infection has taken place, and a slight soreness manifests itself on the glans, with a pimple which soon becomes a small ulcer, marked by its hard surface and elevated edges, take, internally, Mlercury, three times a day (six glob), and wash, externally, with a solution of.Mercury (twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water), until the advice of a physician can be obtained. b. Gonorrhea. Clap. Gleet. If, after infection, a soreness of the whole urethra ensues, with inflammation of the glans in particular, take Aconite, every two or three hours a dose (four glob.), for six or eight times, and after it, if a running appears, use the tincture of Cannabis sat., in the application of which I found the following mode the most convenient and successful. Outwardly, use cold water bathing; to subdue pain and inflammation, keep perfectly guiet, and abstain from all meat diet. Two or three drops of the tincture of Gannabis is put into a four-ounce phial of water, and well shaken; of this mixture, a tablespoonful three times a day is taken; when nearly, but not altogether exhausted, the same phial is refilled with water, well shaken, and thus the second potency offered to the patient; and in this manner the third and fourth potency is administered, at which time all traces of the disease vanish. After the first phial, a slight increase of soreness is frequently complained of by the patient, which, however, soon disappears; and if it re-appears after the third phial, it will entirely leave after the fourth phial thus prepared, has been administered. DIET AND REGIMEN are alike for both complaints: no meat, whatever; but milk, water, and bread; the most perfect rest. APPLICATION OF WATER -hIn the above diseases the frequent use of tepid sitting-baths, the application of wet compresses and the drinking of cold water are particularly recommended as beneficial auxiliaries. [Page 431](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/433) CHAPTER XVI. DISEASES OF FEMALES. THERE are diseases peculiar to the female sex, wh.cse distinctive character is founded in the different physical organization of the female from the male. It shall be our endeavor to be as minute in treating of them as the object of this work will allow, although a great many of them must, and will, always demand the especial attendance of a physician, on account of their importance to life and difficulty of treatment; yet a right knowledge of their nature will diminish fear, and create confidence and trust-a great lever in surmounting medical difficulties. MENSTRUATION. With the appearance of the menses (courses) the age of puberty commences with the female, and various changes take place in the mental and physical development; such as change of voice, expansion of the chest, enlargement of the breast, a marked reserve in manners, and an increased attention to outward decorum and appearance. This time generally comes, in northern climates, between the thirteenth and fifteenth year; in southern, between the eleventh and thirteenth. The same difference of- time is observed in the disappearance of the menstrual discharge, which takes place, in the northern climates, generally between the forty-third and forty-fifth year; in the southern, between thie (431) 432](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/434) 432 DISEASES OF FEMALES. forty-third year. The menses appear quite regularly in a healthy female, every twenty-eight days (a slight deviation of from two to three days earlier or later does not constitute of itself disease), and last, at an average, five days, although this is no absolute rule. We cannot recommend too strongly a strict adherence to the general principles of Hygiene, as the departure from these lays, in most cases, the foundation to those derangements in the menstrual functions which prove so fatal to the life and happiness of a female. And here we may remark that, in the course of a long practice, we have found the wearing of thin-soled shoes to be the most fruitful source of the decay of female beauty, and the decline of female health. The damage of tight lacing (although considerable) is nothing in comparison with the fatal habit of appearing, in all kinds of weather, in thin-soled shoes; the consequences of the latter are beyond description, fearful, and destructive. Almost all diseases which follow a stoppage of the menses, consumption, fluor albus, etc., can be traced to this source. Let reform set in! FIRST MENSES OBSTRUCTED.-TARDY MENSTRUATION. It is of the utmost importance first to know whether a girl, although old enough to be menstruated, is developed sufficiently otherwise to make it necessary for the menses to appear. Menstruation is the result of changes which, at the time of puberty, have to take place in the ovaries, and without which no discharge will be possible, and if forced by medicine to appear, will destroy rather than establish health. As long as the girl has not increased in size across the hips, or the breasts have not become fuller, indeed until the whole form and conduct of the girl shows that this change has taken place in the internal parts, no effort must be made to force nature, as it would be not only fruitless, but really injurious. In such cases a general treatment should be instituted; the girl should be made to exercise freely in the open air, and not be allowed [Page 433](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/435) FIRST IMENSES OBSTRvUCTED. 433 to f1requent school, if in the habit of attending. Nature will soon rally her formative forces, and herself establish without force what medicine could not do without injury. But if the girl. is fully developed otherwise, yet suffers from time to time or at regular monthly intervals from pains and congestions either in the head, breast or abdomen, it is necessary for us to interfere by giving some of the medicines, as described be>low. She has, perhaps, frequent bleeding at the nose, congestions to the head, flushed face, constriction of the chest, palpitation of the heart, etc. If these symptoms manifest themselves, give first, Palsatilla. If, beside other symptoms, she looks rather pale, is slender and feeble, melancholy and sad; feels better in the open air. B3ron'i(a. If she looks flushed in the face, her nose bleeds frequently, inclined to constipation. Veratrum. If she is chilly, and inclined to diarrhea. Slphtwur. If either of the above remedies have not brought on the menses. ADMINISTRATION.-Of the selected medicine, give every evening a dose (four glob.) for four nights, then discontinue four days, and give Sulphur in the same manner. If not better in four or six weeks consult a physician. DIET AND REGIITEN.-Let the diet be simple, but nutri. tious; exercise as much as possible; apply warm foot-baths before going to bed. Another very effective and important means of facilitating the appearance of the first menses, is the use of the hot sitzbat/t every third or fourth evening, just when going to bed. This remedy is especially indicated when the girl frequently suffers from headache, pain in the breast or bleeding of the nose. The temperature of the bath should be from 92 to 96 degrees Fahrenheit, and its duration about 10 minutes, when she retires immediately and covers herself well in bed. 37 [Page 434](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/436) 434- DISEASES OF FEMALES. CHLOROSIS On GREEN SICKNE.SS. If menstruation occurs at the right time, and sufficiently, no disease accompanies its manifestation, and we behold the girl transformed into a woman, approaching all her characteristics, without the slightest degree of sickness or distress. Not always, however, does this great change, which.has its principal seat in the ovaries, take place in such a regular ald icealthy manner. It may appear too early or too tardily; the cidve!opment may be an imperfect one, or may not commence at all; or if it has made its appearance, the various phenomena may not occur in harmony with each other. In all these cases it is evident that the whole organism must participate in the morbid movements of the sexual development, and create disorders which are in more or less intimate connection with it. To this class of diseases belongs Chlorosis or Green disease. DIAGNosIs.-The patients have a peculiar color of the skin, not excessively white, as we see it after severe loss of blood, but a paleness with an admixture of yellow and green; the lips appear at times almost white, the lower eye-lids swell, and appear darkish blue; the skin, rather loose and flabby, feels cold to the touch; the patients themselves can not bear a low temperature, and wish to be where it is warm.'nbhe tongue shows an unusual pale color, and is frequently covered with a thick, tough mucus. The patients evince great muscular weakness; tire very soon after slight exertions; love, therefore, rest, being apparently lazy. The same languor expresses itself in the operations of the mind, which is listless and without energy. The patients breathe hurriedly, not, however, because they have a difficulty in breathing, but on account of not having muscular strength enough to take a deep breath; an examina.tion of the lungs would show no morbid alteration of the texture; the heart palpitates considerably, particularly when going up stairs, and the pulse is accelerated, sometimes to one hundred and forty beats in a minute, yet not full, but small, weak, wiry, and [Page 435](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/437) CHLOROSIS OR GREEN SICKNESS. 435 easily to be compressed. The veins of the skin appear of a pale rose color, never distended as in health; and the blood in them is thin and watery. With a diminished appetite, the patients have a slimy taste in the mouth, pressure in the pit of the stomach, and eructation of wind after eating, even of the most digestible nourishment; sometimes there is an immoderate desire for eating chalk, charcoal, etc. Digestion is deranged, causing sometimes excessive constipation, followed by a diarrhea of substances badly digested. If the affection proceeds unchecked, the lower extremities become swollen, hectic cough sets in, sometimes with expectoration of dark colored clots of blood, symptoms which have all the appearance of a rapid decline. In some cases the nervous system becomes sympathetically affected, producing hysterical fits, spasms, even somnambulism. We have given above a full description of this disease, to enable the reader to recognize it from its first appearance. Although the disease is evidently the result of an inharmonious development of the sexual functions, yet we can not positively fix the cause upon one particular function in all cases. Sometimes menstruation had not made its appearance before the disease sets in, and we naturally infer that its suppression has produced it. In other cases, however, the disease can develop itself, though the menstruation has appeared, but then it must have been either too early or too profuse; which circumstance, reflecting deleteriously on the simultaneous development in other organs of the system, produces chlorosis, by deteriorating nutrition. Any want of harmony, therefore, in the development of the sexual function, can excite this disease. As regards climate, the northern may retard too much, and the southern may too greatly accelerate the formation of the menses. The same may be said in regard to the conditions of life; in the poorer classes every thing has a tendency to weaken; in the richer, to over-stimulate the constitution; either of which has deleterious effects on the normal development of sexual functions. [Page 436](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/438) t436 DISEASES OF FIMALES. More immediate, excitino causes of this disease are those extremes of the mind, exhibiting either a love of indulging in frivolous phantasies and immoral connections, or a depression of spirits, a melancholy caused by home-sickness, troubles of all kinds, and particularly by disappointments in love. IMarshy regions, damp dwellings, excessive exertions, or sedentary habits, immense loss of blood, in fact, every thing which can weaken the constitution, while it needs all its strength to develop the sexual functions, can produce chlorosis. TRuEATlXENT.-As this disease, on account of its great importance, always needs the attendance of a skillful physician, we merely intend to draw the attention of the reader to the principal remedies to be used in the beginning, the application of which frequently prevents its progress. The cause which may have excited it must be removed, if possible, before an application of medicine can be of much avail. If chlorosis occurs in gitris, when the first menses have not yet appeared, the treatment mentioned for obstructions of menstruation, in the following chapter, will be suitable. Among the remedies Pulsatilla will be best adapted to females of a mild disposition, given to sadness and tears, or if exposure to cold or dampness was the cause; if there is difficulty of breathing after slight exertion, sallow complexion, alternating with redness and flushes of heat, palpitation of the heart, cold hands and feet, looseness of the bowels and leucorrhea, cough with expectoration of dark coagulated blood, mental and physical languor. Sulp7hur after the above remedy, if the patient is not relieved. Bryonia alternates well with Pllsthlitua, if there are frequent congestions to the head, bleeding at the nose, dry cough, bitter taste in the mouth, and chilliness, with pain in the small of the back. After Sulphur it is firequently necessary to give Cdtecarea cu-rb., if the oppression of the chest is very great, and the extremities begin to swell, after which Fe3rrum should be given in repeated doses, particularly when the sallow hue of the face continues with [Page 437](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/439) SUPPRESSION OF THE MENSES. AMENORRHEA. 437 great debility, want of appetite, nausea and hectic cough. The above medicines should be given in long intervals, say every third or fourth day a dose (six glob.), until amendment takes place, or another remedy is indicated; Ferrtum may be given in the first trituration, the other remedies in higher pote'ncies. If this disease occurs after severe sickness or hemorrhages, give China and Oadrb. veg.9, every other evening a dose (six glob.), alternately for at least five or six weeks. In both cases, if the above medicines do not relieve, apply to a skillful physician without delay. Perhaps in no disease is the change of climate and scenery so beneficial and really curative as in Chlorosis, and we strongly advise parents, if it is possible to let the patient, particularly in the beginning of the disease, have the benefit of travel and of the salubrious air and water of the so-called Chalybeate Springs. Such a visit to be truly beneficial, must be at least of three or four months duration. APTP ICATION OF WATER.-The frequent use of the sitting bath in the morning, and the sponge-bath in the evening are very beneficial; during the night the patient can apply the wet bandage around the abdomen; but during menstruation all application of water must be omitted. DIET AND REGIMEN.-Let the diet be very nutritious, exercise plentiful, particularly in open air; if mineral springs are chosen for a summer resort, give the preference to the chalybeate, containing iron. SUPPRESSION OF THE MENSES. AMENORRHEA. Or their temporary cessation, when once well established. This occurs either suddenly, by taking cold (from wet feet mostly), overheating, violent mental emotions, faults of diet, etc., and often produces violent congestions to the chest, head, or stomach, with cramps, convulsions, inflammations, etc., there is no disease which could not appear in consequence of it; or the menses have gradually disappeared, without [Page 438](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/440) 438 DISEASES OF FEM3ALES. creating any immediate symptoms in the female economy, giving rise to suspicion of pregnancy. If the suppression of the menses has been caused by the presence of other diseases in the system, such as rheumatism, etc., as above referred to, the cure of these disorders has to be effected by an appropriate treatment, before the return of the menses can be expected. If, however, the suppression is a sudden one in consequence of other morbific causes, producing violent symptoms, select from among the following remedies the most homceopathic, and administer either in solution (twelve glob.) in half teacupful of water, every hour or two hours a teaspoonful, or in the dry state (four glob.) in the same intervals until better, or until another remedy is indicated. TREATMENT.- Beside the remedies recommended in \" Obstructions of the First Menses,\" which will be of the greatest benefit here, and of which Pulsatilla is the principal, we recommend Aconite. In alternation with Bryonia, every hour or two hours a dose (four glob.), in a sudden check of the menses, producing congestions to the head and chest, or Cocculus, in alternation with Veratrum, in the same manner, if severe cramps in the abdomen are present. Opium. If all the blood seems to have rushed to the head, producing heaviness there, with a dark redness of the face, and drowsiness, alternately with 4Apes. mel. Cuprum. In spasms of the chlest, and in alternation with VYeratrum, if, also, the abdomen suffers; or with Opium, if the head is congested, and with Apis. mel., if faint at the stomach. If the menses have been checked by mental agitation or depression, take those remedies recommended for fright, fear, etc., in \"Affections of the Mind.\" See this article. ADMINISTRATION the same as in Aconite, above. APPLICATION OF WATER.-See \" Chlorosis.\" [Page 439](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/441) MENSTRUATION EARLY. 439 I ivjal Jieflnstruatiom. if eas \u2014al colic. t i ys)'n7enorrlhea.) The causes of these tormrecatilg distreSses of females are gecner,!cy ildly in the early partl' of womanhood, and owing c!hiefly to improper treatment of other diseases, suppression of eruptions or habitual disclharges, rheumatic disorders, colds, etc. The p1ains either appear before or during the flow of tle nenses, sometimrnes resembling real labor pains, with bearing d(own and forcing; at other times as a constant aching in the loins, hips, and limbs. They generally diminish in violence as soon as the regular flow has commenced, but not always.

If this does not suffice take aVtx vetm., if the forcing pains predominate; Cocculus, if colic pains in the abdomen appear, with shortness of breath; Chamomile, if wihll discharge of dark-colored blood, there are pains, like labor-pains, togetIher with colic pains and tenderness of the abdomen, in alternation with A4pis mel. If a profuse perspiration sets in while in bed, do not leave it soon after the pains cease, nor cool off too quickly, else the pains return. Avoid the use of heating substances, either externally, or internally, save a warm brick on the feet or sto-naclh.

Almost a specific in all passive hemorrhages where feebleness, dullness, nausea, and coagulated discharges prevail.

Whllere the mlenses return every two weepks, spirits are depressed; in alternation with Ipecac., if its symptoms are also present. Belladonna. Heat and pains in the head, with cold feet and dryness of the throat; bearino down in the abdomen. Calcarea carb. is almost a specific in this disease, where with the menses a diarrhea or frequent discharges from the bowels appear, with pains in the bowels; suitable after Belladonna. Sul/phur. If the menstruation is too early and too profuse. Vatruml muriaticum. If Calcarea carb. is insufficient. ADMINISTRATION.-Just before, or in the beginnino of the menses, one or two doses of the selected medicine every three hours one dose (six glob.); after the menses are over, take one more dose and then wait until the next appearance of the menses, and observe whether they are more regular, as regrards time. Menstruation too Late and too Scanty. Pulsatilla is the principal remedy, when the above difficulty exists, and also when the menses appearl irregular, sometimes too late and too profuse (as this is the case particularly at the critical period-change of life), sometimes too early and too scanty. In the former, Lachesis alternates well with Pulsatilla. In most all cases, Sulphur is necessary, to complete the cure.

DIET AND REGIMEN.-The drink must be cold and not stimulating; except when faintness appears, with deadly paleness of the face, no pulse, and cloudiness of sight, give wine and brandy, in frequent, small quantities. Camphor and China, in such cases, are of the greatest benefit. The patient ought to lie perfectly quiet. MJfenstruation of too long qDuration. Compare \"Menstruation too Copious,\" and give of the selected medicine every evening and morning a dose (six glob.) until better. (See, also, next article, on \" Change of Life, or Critical Period.\") DIET in such cases must be highly nutritious. It is best to consult a physician early. Critical Period. Cessation o' the Jlfenses. (Change of Life.) This period, commencing' about at the age of forty-five years, forms one of the most important in the life of a female. If not guided through this critical time by the counsel and aid of a skillful physician, she gathers the seeds of endless miseries, or even early death. This period may be a blessing to her, as well as a source of great distress; as after it her healtll either becomes more confirmed, or disoroganizations in internal organs are formed, which soon carry her off. Without enlarging further on the subject, we recommend the early and constant advice of a skillfiul physician during this time, which generally lasts from one and a half to two years. First, an irregularity of the courses is experienced; tley stop for three months, then reappear with gireat violence, then stop for four or six months, during which time the wonmIan [Page 443](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/445) PROLAPSUS UTERI - FALLING OF TI1E WOMB. 443 shows more or less symptoms of congestions; piles appear; the limbs swell; pruritus (violent itching of the private parts) frequently sets in, also cramps and colics in the abdomen; asthma and palpitation of the heart t; sick-headache; hysterics; apoplexy, etc. These maladies are so various, and continually chanoging' and complicated, that they require the constant watchful care of a family physician. Do not neglect them. TREATMENT.-We can here only give general rules: eat and drink moderately; sleep in airy, well-ventilated rooms; avoid violent emotions or exercise, but contrive to be busy mentally and bodily; shun exposure to inclement weather, wet feet, etc. (See \"Hygiene.\") Pulsatilla and Lcachesis are, in this period, the principal remedial agents, of which take every six days one dose (six glob.) alternately, unless other remedies are necessary. If diseases otherwise occur, see their respective chapters. PROLAPSUS UTERI. (Falling of the Womb). From the position the womb naturally occupies, hanging suspended on four ligaments in the middle of the pelvic cavity, the reader can easily infer that it can change its position in all directions; one of the most frequent consists in a sinking down, to a less or greater extent, into the lower part of the pelvic cavity, sometimes so far down as to protrude externally. An event of this kind must produce considerable derangement in the female organism. The most prominent symptoms of this disorder are fully described by Dr. Dewees, as follows: \"The symptoms, characterizing this complaint will be modified by the greater or less descent of the uterus in the vagina; they will be intense in proportion to the extent of the displacement; but in all there will be a sense of something sinking in the vagina, as if the perineum were sustaining an unusual weight; with a dragging sensation about the hips and loins; a desire to make water, sometimes without the ability to do so; [Page 444](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/446) 444 4 DISEASES OF'FESIAL ES. or if it do pass, it is reluctantly, and. oftentimes painfully hot -a, sense of faintness, and occasionally a number of nervous or hysterical feelings and alarms, which almost overwhelm the patient. A pressure and feeling about the rectum,, resembling a slight tenesmus. sometimes importunely demand the patient's attention, which, if she obey, almost always end in unavailing eforIts.'1The p:ain in the back is sometimes extremely distressiuD whliie the patient is on her feet, and gives to her walk the app'arance of weakness in her lower extremities. A beenumbing sensation shoots down the thighs, especially when the womipan first rises upon her feet; or when she chainges this position for a horizontal one. In some few instances, the roma'in is olbliged to throw her bodly very much in advance; or is olvigedl to support herself by placing her hands upon her thinhs Iwhen she attempts to walk. But all these unpleasant symlptoms subside <almost immediately if she indulge in a recuumbent posture, and this circumstance pretty strongly designates the dlisease.' However wl markled the above symptoms are, particularly the one last mentioned, they are not sufficiently so to prevent mistakes fion'l lacig macde in its diagnosis. An examination of the parts involved should never be omitted, as without it we never can be positive in pronouncing the disease prolapsus uteri. Dr. Dewees relates a case of this hind. \"I was consulted by a lady, who had long suffered almost every symptoma recorded above; I pronounced her disease to be a prolapsus of the uterus; and -without an examination per vaginam, had a pessary made for its support; but, to my sad mortification, when I was about to apply it, a careful examination proved that no such condition existed, and that all the unpleasant symptoms had arisen from a thickening of the neck of the bladder.\" But not all practitioners avow frankly, like Dr. Dewees, their errors in this respect; after once having pronounced a simi!a.r complaint to be falling of the womb. they rather persist in their opinion, even after having ascertained by actual [Page 445](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/447) PROLAPSUS UTERI.-FALLING OF THE WOMB. 445 examination that no prolapsus exists. In this manner falling of the womb has been multiplied in such a degree, that it may be counted now among the fashionable diseases, which any lady of standing or delicate feeling ought to have, at least a touch of it. While patients complain of symptoms, similar to prolapsus, some physicians hastily and without examination pronounce them to indicate this latter disease, thereby forcing their remedial action into a direction, often detrimental to the welfare of their patients. We have seen women tormented for yeairs under a treatment against prolapsus uteri by several physicians, who, one after another, had readily yielded to the incorrect diagnosis of the preceding one. All that time these patients had not the slightest real symptoms of prolapsus or dislocation; they were afflicted with neuralgia, congestion, induration of the womb, etc., diseases which soon were removed by a, rational (homoeopathic) internal treatment.:' Rheumatism of the uterus is a frequent cause of feelings resembling falling of the womb, and a practitioner should be very cautious in pronouncing the existence of a disease so dissimilar in its treatment from the former. Although a great many physicians yet adhere to the use of pessaries and abdominal supporters in the cure of prolapsus uteri, we must confess that we have never seen such good result as would induce us to persist in their use. Since we have become acquainted with the specific power of homoepathic medicines and the tonic virtues of cold water in the form of a c.- While \\vr'-ti l thy aby:)ve, we see in an article on uterine displacements by Dr. Ramsay, in the Boston Medical Journal, similar complaints made as to the fictitious prevalence of prolapsus uteri; which, according to the statement of that gentleman, is far greater in the South than in other parts of the country. We can testify in some degree to the truth of this fact ourselves. Residing in Cincinnati, we had for a number of years frequent occasion to attend ladies from the South, the complaints of many of whom resembled greatly the symptoms attending prolapsus uteri. According to their statement they were suffering from prolapsus, having been told so repeatedly by their physicians; yet, upon examination, not the slightest trace of such a disease could be detected. We are glad to see that this professional error attracts the attention of those who best can correct it. Hear [Page 446](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/448) 446 DISEASES OP FESMALES. sitz-bath and wet bandage, we have discarded the use of pessaries and other supporters, almost entirely. In the commencement of a cure for this disease, the patient should remain in a lying posture for a length of time, also otherwise reftrain from active exercise as much as possible. The wet bandage, twice a day renewed, and frequent sittingbaths of short duration, will be of great benefit. WVe found the following remedies the most beneficial in this disease. Belluadonvr a and Sepia, alternately, every other morning a dose (six glob.), until better, at least for one week; during the next week the patient discontinues the medicine, but repeats the above prescription during the week following. These medicines are succeeded, if necessary, after six weeks, by Ccalcarea carb., to be taken in the same manner. Sometimes, during the above treatment, a dose of _Nux vom., Pilatiha, Opium, Coccu6lus and lgnatia may be found necessary, if the patient exhibits a good deal of nervousness with constipation. All stimulating diet is strictly prohibited; no coffee, no tea can be allowed; but good nourishing food is beneficial. Other displacements of the womb may occur in various directions. The retroversion of the uterus, or that state wherein the womb is turned over backward, occurs perhaps the most frequently, and produces many disturbances in the alvine and urinary discharges by actual pressure on the rectum and Dr. Ramsay; \" This prolapsus question has been a hobby for many a pretender to secure fame, and scores of women South have been injected per vaginam with sulph. zinc, nit. arg. et id omne genus, to their serious detriment, for the mal-position of an organ from which they never suffered. Any man, with a thimbleful of brains, who will put himself to the trouble to examine the anatomical situation of the womb, will see at a glance, that the organ, in its normal and physiological condition, is not easily prolapsed, at least not with the facility once supposed. We admit real prolapsus is too common; but at the same time we protest against referring every little uneasy sensation in the hypogastric region to uterine descension. It is high time we were awakening from this unprofitable and unmeaning slumber, with regard to female affections, etc. God speed the time for the benefit of our wives and daughters.\" [Page 447](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/449) LEUCORRHEA. FLUOR ALBUS. 447 bladder, frequent hemorrhages the womb, fluor albus and menstrual irregularities. The anteversior of the uterus presents a deviation in a direction opposite to the former, the fundus uteri inclining toward, or even resting on the bladder, the neck and mouth of the womb toward the rectum. A distress similar to the former is the consequence. LEUCORRHEA. FLUOR ALBUS. (Whites.) This troublesome and weakening complaint consists in a discharg'e of mucus, variously colored, and of different consistency, ifrom the private parts. It occurs, generally, between the age of puberty and the critical period, and is seldom seen later than this, except when discharges of this kind are excited in consequence of the disorganization of the womb. If it manifests itself in children, or even in infants, it is either on account of want of cleanliness of these parts, or local irritations, such as are produced by pin-worms (ascarides), etc. Weakly females, of a nervous, relaxed, or excited temperamlent, are more prone to it; and the more our present state of society becomes over-civilized, with its legion of pleasures, inactivity of body, idle and late hours, bad literature, and immloderate use of tea, coffee, and spices of all kinds (we mention here, only as an instance, the increased use of vanilla), the more easily will this disease be eng'endered. It would carry us too far, to go into the pbractical detail of a disease which requires the most skillful attention of a medical attendant; and we earnestly recommend an application to him in an early stage of the disease. Beside this we recommend cold water, in all its various applications, as the best means to restore the tone and strengtb of the weakened parts of the system.'The principal medicines to be taken domestically, the a ffcled pl;rts.

D,:virrtion of ame1a.ss is a term signifying the appearance of a monthly discharge of blood from other places of the system, such,as t'he lungs, bowels, nose, stomach, etc., whlich has the effect, that while it lasts, the real menstruation can not appear. This aberration, as it may properly be called, of a discharge so vitally connected with the sexual functions, has been observed to have taken place from all organs and parts of the system, bowels, stomach, rectum, fauces, nose, gums, urinary organs, [Page 449](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/451) PREGNANCY. 449 respiratory organs, eyes, ears, ulcers and wounds, wherever they were; the principal places, however, are the nose, stomach, and the end of the rectum. As regards the causes of this singular phenomenon, a great diversity of opinion exists, as yet, amongr the authors; we have mentioned its occurrence here, to enable the reader to recognize its appearance, and to administer such medicines in its beginning, as are advisable. Should the disease resist those remedies, the advice of a skillful physician must be sought at once. If the discharge appears monthly through the eyes, Gmhamom., Nux vore., Carb. veg. and Bella. will prove beneficial; if through the nose or ears, Bryoniat, iercury, Rhuas and Silicea; if through the lips and ygums, Bryonia, Mercury and Phosphorus; if through the fauces and lungs, Phos9phorus, Bryonwia; if through the stomach by vomiting,.Bryonia, CGrb. vey., Nzx vonz., Arsenic, Sulphur. The latter remedy will be the most important in every case at the end of the cure to prevent a relapse. PREGNANCY. As a state of purely physiological development pregnancy does not, of itself, imply disease as a necessary consequence during its duration. Yet the many ailments which accompany it at the present day, being the legitimate result of the complicated, unnatural conditions and habits of society, create and sustain the idea which people generally entertain, that a pregnant woman can never be free from one or the other disease. It is our duty, therefore, to give the reader, if not an extended treatise, at least a synopsis of those ailments commonly experienced during gestation, together with their treatment. SIGNS OF PREGNANCY. There are but very few general symptoms constant enough to be reliable in all cases, which indicate conception and pregnancy in its earliest stage. We will name them here, however, 38 [Page 450](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/452) 450 DISEASES OF FEMALES. in order to enable the reader to form a judgment of them, if they should occur. She feels a singular emotion of painful pleasure, and a shuddering, proceeding from the spine; a pain in the region of the navel, sometimes a sensation of motion in the abdomen, and a tickling in the region of the hips; she feels fatigued and sleepy; this state is followed by a sense of fullness, warmth and heaviness in the abdomen. r'he first more certain sign of pregnancy, is the suppression of menstruation, which, if not caused by other morbid circumstances, indicates that the internal surface of the uterus, from which the menstrual blood is secreted, is now engaged in other secretions, stimulated into existence by the presence of a fecundated ovum, which has been retained in the uterus, adherinlg, generally, within its upper portions. Sometimes menstruation may continue for several months; in such cases the menstrual blood is secreted from the lower portions of the uterus, while in its upper, the changes take place necessary for the growth of the fetus. Another well attested sign is sickness at the stomach, with which a great many women are troubled in the beginning of pregnancy; it is uncertain, however, in as far as other congestive states of the uterus, such as suppression of the menses, etc., may produce it, without having the slightest reference to pregnancy. If the above signs are present in consequence of true pregnancy, other symptoms will soon develop themselves to verify it. These are enlargement of the breasts, brown circles around the nipples, appearance of milk in the breasts, and finally an enlargement of the hypogastric region. All these signs found together, form a plausible array of symptoms in favor of the existence of pregnancy, yet they are in themselves not sufficient to prove it positively, because they may be produced by other morbid agencies. Women, who have children, possess signs, which, individually, are mostly sure in indicating pregnancy. For instance, some always have tooth-ache, styes on the eye-lids, [Page 451](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/453) PROGRESS OF PREGNANCY. 451 or black spots on the face, neck or hands, like freckles; others are taken at once, without a known cause, with salivation, which, in some instances, proceeds for a long time, unless mitigated by the use of ale, champagne, or Scotch herring; still others have strange desires or longings, modifications of the appetite for unusual substances, such as chalk, etc. All these signs, belonging strictly to idiosyncrasies, are, therefore, no absolute signs of pregnancy, but only accidental. The most sure sign of pregnancy which a woman can have, is the quickening, or the motion of the child. It generally takes place at four and a half months from the beginning of gestation, and serves, therefore, as a mark of reckoninlg, being the mniddle of the time allowed generally for the duration of pregnancy. In but very few cases, quickening occurs either sooner or later. When this takes place, it may be safely presumed, in connection with the former signs, that a true preg1nancy exists, which has, at that time, already run half its courseo PROGRESS OF PREGNANCY. A fecundcated ovule, if it shall grow, must adhere to the sides of the uterus; if it does, we may consider conception to have taken place in reality. Then the uterus is stimulated to secrete from its walls oil all sides, a membrane, called the decidua, lining the whole internal cavity of the uterus, and forming the medium between fetus and mother, by which the former caii come into communication with the blood circulation of the latter. Within this membrane a circulation is established. which unites the child with the mother, through the cord and the after-birth, the former adhering to the child, the latter to the uterus, in which it roots, like a tree in the ground, both contiiniiig veins and arteries for the fux and reflux of the blood. The blood of the child does not go over into the circulation of the mother, to become decarbonized, but is oxygenized by being exposed in the finest ramifications of the placenta to [Page 452](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/454) 452 DISEASES OF FEMALES. the oxygen carried thither by the arteries of the uterus. Thus the grea }t purpose of oxygelizing the blood is carried on witho it:, he nccessity of illaStilnl the lungs with atmospheric air, which, of courlse, would be impossible in fetal existence. The fetus, or young being in the womb, from this time up, grows and develops itself with astonishing rapidity, in the thousands of intricate parts which constitute the human organism. Though bound together by the vital force in one harmonious whole, the various parts of the different systems develop not all simultaneously, but gradually crystallize, as it were, into one whole body. This formative process consumes more than one-half of the uterine life of the new being. If no disturbing influences interfere, it will develop in a perfect manner; but if morbid causes should operate on the fetus, its harmonious development may be intercepted, and its growth arrested at any period during gestation, in certain parts of the system, while others develop themselves naturally. This fact explains the origin of those organic imperfections and deformities which characterize the so-called monsters, whose singular appearance is sometimes attributed, by the ignorant, to mysterious causes. To this class of arrested fetal development belong also most of those cases, where children are born with marks on their bodies, or limbs not developed or even entirely wanting. It is not as yet sufficiently settled, whether such a state of things can be produced through the influence of the mother on the child, some physiologists denying its possibility, as no nervous connection between the two is as yet found to exist. Whether or not fear, fright, etc., operating violently on the nervous system of the mother, can affect the child, we know at least, that misfortunes of this kind arebestaverted by avoiding those violent nervous emotions. EXERCISE. Bodily exercise, or even fatigue, is easier borne by a pregnant woman than mental excitement. While the former increases [Page 453](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/455) DRESS. 453 her physical health, and consequently that of the child, the latter disables the energies of her system, and must injuriously reflect on the child's development. It is the duty of the future mother to live and act during gestation in a manner that her offspring may be benefited thereby. Nothing must be omitted to realize this, the principal object of. her life. She must expect, beforehand, to undergo all kinds of hardships and to make severe personal sacrifices; the thought that it is for the benefit of her future offspring, will strengthen her to an indefinite decree of fortitude and cou rage. She must take daily exercise, sufficient and of an active lature. For instance, riding in a earriage does not belong to the active exercises; walking, particularly in the open air, is more active, and therefore better calculated to invigorate the system of a pregnant woman. The best, however, is that exercise which. accompanies the daily attendance to the various duties of a household. In these the pregnant woman can find employment sufficient for body and mind up to the very last hour of her confinement, and more suitable to invigorate her own and the child's health, than any other. She must not merely direct the affairs of the house; such a course would not accomplish the ends in view. But she must be active and busy herself, if it is only in the lighter kinds of work, such as setting the table, sweeping and dusting the rooms, etc. If she does not feel well at such a time, particularly if she is threatened with abortion, she must not commence, or if she has, must cease at once, to exercise in the above manner. A perfectly healthy woman, however, should. not neglect these exercises under the mere pretext of being unbecoming or too fatiguing. DRESS. Next to exercise, the most important consideration is dress, which ought to be as loose as possible, in order to allow the Agpst ample liberty for enlargement. Corsets, or tight clothes [Page 454](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/456) 454 DISEASES OF -FEMIALES, generally, are very injurious, as every one will readily concede. It must be understood, however, that she ought to dress sufficiently warm at all times, to feel comfortable. If she has been in the habit of washing and bathing in cold water, the state of pregnancy, even far advanced, does not prevent her from fi;lowing this most important hygienic rule as long as it is convenient or shows its beneficial effects by re-acting on the system in a healthful glow. PERIODS OF PREGNANCY. Quickening is a term by which is generally expressed the first perception a woman has of the child's muscular action, and not as if life, at that time, first entered the child. It may vary as to time and power of expression; in some women it occurs earlier and strolnger, because the child may be more active and strong; in others it is retarded and weak, because the child may be less lively and powerful or the quantity of the child's water greater. Upon the whole, however, it may be said that quickening occurs in the middle of pregnancy, or four and a half months from either the conception or the birth of the child. Yet, very many and great exceptions to this rule exist; in some women it may never manifest itself, in others it may appear as early as two months and a half after conception, as one lady I knew myself used to experience. Syncope or fainting is not an unfrequent accompaniment of quickening, but soon ceases after the woman has become more habituated to the peculiar feelings of motion in her womb made by the child. About this time the womb has extended so much as to raise itself out of the pelvic cavity, thus acquiring more room for extension and the facility to rest on its brim. From this time up to the seventh month the growth of the child is very rapid and perceptible in the outward appearance of the future mother, the most prominent feature of which is the so called \"pouqtil outt of the navel\" or its protrusion, which takes place between the sixth and seventh month. The navel, instead of forming [Page 455](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/457) DISEASES DURING PREtCXNAN'CY. 455 a hollow, is now pressed outwardly by the force of the gravid uterus which sometimes causes the navel to protrude. In the seventh month the child has acquired such a perfection of development, in all its parts, that it is able to subsist outside the womb, if accident or disease should have hastened its birth. Any birth previous to the seventh month is, therefore, called very properly an abortion, indicatilng, thereby, the impossibility of the birth of a living child, although some exceptions may even here take place; while a birth at the seventh and before the ninth month is designated as a premature birth, because the child can live, although premnaturely born, and consequently of difficult raising. Pregnancy has, in most cases, a duration of nine months, each of thirty days, although sometimes it lasts two hundred and eighty days, or ten months, each of twenty-eight days; cases have even occurred, within my knowledge, where ladies were not confined until the three hundredth day after conception, which constitutes ten solar months, each of thirty days. Accordingly we see that a variation of thirty days is possible, or that a regular birth may occur between two hundred and seventy and three hundred days of pregnancy. We will now consider the most common aliments during pregnancy. DISEASES DURING PREGNANCY. Pregnant females, even if ever so healthy otherwise, are liable to diseases to which pregnancy, as such, predisposes. These we will treat of in particular; while, for other ailments, we refer the reader to their respective headings, giving here only the most suitable medicines: For moral affections (see Pulsatilla, lgnatia, Belt ladonna. In all the above diseases, compare their respective chapters. MORNING SICKNESS-NAUSEA, ETC. This distressing complaint is present during pregnancy in some females; in others it is wanting. It begins usually about six weeks after conception, and lasts up to the fourth, fifth, even seventh month, more or less violently. It is of a constitutional origin, and can not be taken away easily, as the exciting cause still exists. The same may be said about the spitting of frothy saliva, with which some women are troubled. As the nausea generally is greatest when the patient rises in the morning, the disease has received the name \"morning siclczess.\" Its cause is as yet enveloped in the general mystery which hangs over the secret proceedings of gestation, and its sympathy with other functions. An increased uterine sensibility, reflecting on the ganglion nervous system, seems to be the excitor of a great many of these sufferings during pregnancy, and a proper, harder mode of life the best calculated to prevent them. However, this hard, active life, in which manual labor forms the principal occupation, must not be commenced during pregnancy, but prior to it, in order to prepare the system for making the change within beforehand. This disease commonly ceases at the third or fourth month, very seldom continuing through the whole term. The nausea is frequently succeeded by the vomiting of a frothy mucus, s.metimes even of bile, after it has continued for some time quite violently. Various means have been tried to subdue this affection, but what in one case is successful, often fails in another. Generally we have found that riding in a carriage, even over a rough road, produces more comfort to the patient than anything else; fresh air and a voyage certainly have relieved some of the most distressing and obstinate cases. [Page 457](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/459) NAUSEA AND VOMITING DURING PREGNANCY. 457 LExer cise in the open air, cheerful society, strengthening food, and refreshing drinks, such as ale, lemonade, or salt fish, sardines, smoked herring, are frequently means to alleviato the sufferings. The following medicines, also, often hapve a. good effect.,e consider ta barczt. to be the principal remedy, particularly ii, withl nausea, there is fainting and a deadly paleness of the tace, relieved by being in the open air; the patient los:s flesh very fast; vomiting of water or acid liquid and MLiUCUS.

APPLICATION OF WATER.-See \" Sea-sickness\" page -'o ADMINISTRATION.-Give of the selected remedy three or four doses (four glob. each) a day, for two or three days in succession before the application of another remedy. PRURITUS. (Itchi ng.) Itching of the Private Parts.-This is perhaps the most distressing and troublesome disease to which females are sub. ject; it takes away rest and sleep, thus producing soietim,:s the most extreme debility. We are as yet unable to determine the precise cause of this disease; in most cases, however. it must be the secretion of some acrid fluid, which is discharged on these parts at intervals, when the itching takes -place. Want of cleanliness may aggravate the attack, but scarcely ever can be its sole cause. Pruritus more frequently attacks pregnant women, but is not confined to them alone. At first its appearance may produce in the mind of the sufferer a suspicion of being affected with some secret disorder, thus adding mental sufferings to the intolerable physical ones, particularly if the disease appears in the form of aphthous eruption, like the thrush of infants. In such cases a strong solution of borax in water, applied three or four times a day, if necessary by a syringe, will remove the itching in a short time. Another very excellent remedy is the injection of ornmoniated water into the vagina; it is best applied alternately with that of the borax solution. The constant application of cold water is necessary in a few cases where the itchingis more in external parts; it affords sometimes the only means to procure rest and sleep for the patient. [Page 459](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/461) VARICOSE VEINS. 459 1We should never omit to institute an internal treatment; the following remedies, to be given in their order, will be of great benefit; each remedy should be used for three days, twice a day a dose (six glob.), until better. Of internal remedies I have found Con.iuzm the most efficacious; it almost acts like a specific, curing nine out of ten cases. Give this remedy first a good trial, even before using the external remedies. But if it should not cure in eight days, give the following remedies as above designated. subject, we will draw the attention of the reader to a precautionary rule in the external treatment of this disease. If a patient, afflicted with pruritus, has schirrous tumors in the breast, the external application of the borax for the pruritus should be preceded by the internal use of the remedies above mentioned; in a similar case coming under our notice, the schirrus began to degenerate into an open cancer as soon as the pruritus had been hastily removed by the external use of borax alone; the lady in question died soon after. VARICOSE VEINS. A complaint which consists in an extension of the veins on the lower extremities, owing to the pressure of the pregnant uterus on the large veins of the abdomen, impeding the speedy return of the venous blood upward, creating, thereby, stagnation. If they are not painful and large, frequent washing in cold water is sufficient, as they speedily disappear after the birth of the child. But when they are very large and painful, the patient should lie down for a few days, and apply beside, if necessary, a bandage or laced stocking, to compress the extended veins. This bandage should be applied in the morning, when the least swelling is present. The following remedies can be taken with benefit, every three days one dose (six glob.), changing tle medicines every [Page P1REGNANCY. Yellowish or brownish spots on the face, which often appear in pregnant females, require the use of Sepia, every eight days one dose (six glob.), for five or six weeks or until better; if not, Sulphur in the same manner. PLETHORA-CONGESTION- FEVER. These are forms of diseases to which pregnant women are mor inclined than others, because in that state the blood has naturally a higher degree of plasticity or formative energy, which explains the fact that women otherwise weakly and badly nourished, frequently suffer in this direction; how much more must it be the case where women allow themselves to indulge in too nourishing and highly seasoned food or stimulating drinks. Plethora manifests itself by a full, hard and more frequent pulse, rush of blood to the head, vertigo, buzzing before the ears, numbness of the extremities, asthma, sleeplessness, etc. In such a state it would be dangerous to await her confinement; various diseases might result from this plethoric condition, of which we will mention only one-convulsions-sufficiently important to induce energetic action against plethora during gestation. Congestion and fever do not differ materially from the former in symptoms or their intensity; they appear upon the whole, however, more locally and are more transient. The principal treatment, particularly to prevent plethora, consists in a rigid and careful regimen as to diet, exercise and habit.'This, in most cases, will be sufficient to prevent its appearance, and obviate all further medication. For this purpose the patient must avoid all mental and corporeal excitement; eat little but often, more vegetables than meat; drink [Page 461](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/463) TE:M OR IiAGEs. 461 nothing but or lemionades, if she is not inclined to diarrhea; dress not too warm and exercise freely in the open air, avoiling, however, fatigue. If no-twithstanding these dietetic rules, symptoms of plethora d.,evelop themselves, the patient should take, from time to time, AcJnioe and Belladonna alternately, every six, twelve or twenty-four hours a dose (six glob.), which, better than bleeding, will counteract the above named plastic quality of the blood, the real cause of plethora. It is not a surplus of blood which forms the characteristic of plethora; such a thing can not exist in the vessels limited to a certain quantity; this surplus, if it existed, would sooner burst the vessels in the nose and lungs than be confined in too small a room. The above idea has only obtained on account of the means which were used to counteract the evil. Bleeding was heretofore considered the only remedy for plethora, and as it certainly gives momentary relief, the physicians judged the disease by the remedy, or rather by the action which the remedy produced. Subsequent investigations have shown that the benefit of a venesection does not consist so much in the lesser quantity of blood remaining after it in the system, but in the nervous influence, and its reflection on the quality of the remaining blood. Bleeding constitutes, therefore, a remedy for this form of disease, although its application is limited to but few instances, particularly where plethora threatens to give rise to that formidable disease called puerperal convulsions, one form of which is frequently occasioned by a state resembling plethora, where an early venesection will be beneficial, if the head is very much congested at the time. H-EMORRHAGES. In the article on menstruation, we treated of the hemorrhages from the womb, which if they occur during pregnancy, require a siimilar treatment, except in cases where symptoms of a miscarriage appear; for these the reader will find the [Page 462](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/464) 462 DISEASES OF IFEMALES. necessary advice in the article on that subject. Here we intend to speak about the hemorrhages from other parts of the system, from the nose, the lunys and the stomach. They are frequently caused by a congestive tendency and have a critical import as to their cause. If they are not too severe at the time, the local congestion generally is diminished by them, and the patients feel relieved afterward. But if they are too profuse and repeat too often, it is necessary to interfere. Acontite should be used first, particularly if a feverish state preceded the hemorrhage; if it does not speedily relieve, alternate it with Bryonia, in solution, every half hour a teaspoonful. If there is however, not much fever, but more coldness, or if the blooding has already continued fbor some time, give Ipecac. and China in alternation, also in solution, in the same manner until better. In slight cases the above prescription will be suitable for hemorrhage from the nose, stomach and lungs; in severe cases of bleeding from the lungs, the alternate use of Opium and ipecac., or C/linca will be necessary; in that of the stomach, China and Teratrrum or Arsenic, and the application of cold water or ice on the root of the nose if the bleeding from this part does not yield speedily. In regard to the vomiting of blood, we would yet remark that it constitutes, frequently, a symptom of inflammlation of the spleen, and if so, the treatment of this disease must be instituted before the vomiting can stop. HEMORRHOIDS-PILES. This disease of the rectum frequently occurs during the latter part of gestation, and occasions, beside great annoyance and distress, sometimes even symptoms of threatening miscarriage. By carefully avoiding constipation, which may be considered one of the principal causes of this complaint, it can be mostly prevented or its attacks rendered mild and comparatively short. We can also by medicines given internally, and [Page 463](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/465) SWELLING OF THE FEET AND LOWER LIMBS. 463 water, either warm or cold, applied externally, mitigate the severe pains and swelling s, though we may not be able to cure tlhi;,ise:tse while gestation continues, which being its cause, will eoi)stlntly re-produce it. Vu.z: vu,,it'ra and S,7lph evening a ( osc (six glob.), are the principal remedies against it. If the.nc hould not relieve within a few days, recourse may be lalI to I/,taii7'i, if the pains, like violent stitches, shoot upward,,niid much blo:)d is discharged, or the rectum protrudles at each ev\\'uatioln; it also quiets the nervous system, if irritated by the ineffictual straining to evacuate, so often experienced after a dischlarge in persons troubled. with piles. f' clnstipation i.s present in a high degree, alternate lynati a with Opiuta. every two or three hours a dose (six glob.), until better. if these remedies do not relieve, give the following. Sepia, BPell.-'., E1::par, Lachesis, Arsenicurn, Garb. veg. in their order, in. intervals of a day; of each remedy two doses (six glob. each). until better. Externally the application of cold water in sitz-baths, compresses or injections, is of the greatest benefit when the tumors do not bleed, but are very much enlargyed -and painful: while the warm water or steam is prefer. able when the tumors bleed or have ceased to bleed, yet continue to be very painful. Almost entire abstinence from food, except bread and water for a few days, shall, according to some others, be an excellent dietetic in piles. Meat diet is to be avoided as much as possible. The removal of the tumors by the knife is a painful, and during pregnancy, highly dangerous operation, as thereby abortion may be excited. We, therefore, warn the reader never to have an operation of this kind performed during pregnancy. SWELLING OF TIIE FEET AND LOWER LIMBS. The same casuse, which during gestation, produces varicose veins and piles, can also produce a swelling of the feet, the [Page 464](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/466) DISEASES OF';EMALES. Fihm.bs and even of the whole body, as in some extraordinary caiss it has been witnessed. By the pressure of thle extenrcdd womb on the larger lymphatics, a anail eluse: it to accumulate within the areolar tissue. In the evniinI thae iower limbs are generally swollen more, as the water sinks by its own gravity; in the morning the face and eye-lids show more of the watery infiltration. As long as no fevor, at leasti no full, hard pulse attends a circumstance of this kind, it is of no great significance, save the annoyance and trouble to thie patient. It disappears quickly after delivery, sometimess ill a few hours; neither does it interfere to such a degree durting delivery, as might be believed from the extent of the swelling. An immense absorption must take place, even duri)ng parturition, because in one case, which came under our own observation,' no hindrance to a successful termination of the birth was experienced, although prior to its commencement, it seemed almost imposssible that it could take place at all, in such a degree were the external parts swollen. almost closed. In that case, the absorption took place during the labor, as soon as by change of position, the child exerted no more pressure on the lymphatics. But if the pulse is hard and full, measures must be tacken to relieve the patient. She must take exercise, keep the bowels open by means of cold water injections, and the internal use of Br~yonlia and Opitni, every two hours a dose (six glob.), until relieved; if the fever rises still higher, take Aconite and -Bronlia in the same manner.

DERANGE;rA-ENT OF APPETITE. This may manuifest itself in va;Crious ways. Sometimes a aomplete disgus-t for every kind of food occurs, while in other cases, the appetite is so excessive as to become really a sympt'om of a diseased state of the stomach; again, in some cases it becomes capricious, desiring' the striangtest. and most unusual articles for food, such as chalk, charcoal, etc. As it is aliost impossible to ccrrect this abnormal condition by the application of medicine, we rimust recommend to those suffering under it, [Page 466](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/468) 466 DISEASES OF FEMALES. to consult their own feelings as long as it is prudent and reasonable. Any excess must be detrimental. To rellain without food for too long a time, merely because we have an aversion against it, would finally lead to an incurable state of exhaustion. One article, ice-creawm, a patient of this kin1 certainly can bear, if nothing else will stay on the stomach; she can at least sustain life with it. In some cases I have seen that Scotch herring, ale, champaigne, or other spicy articles, did overcome the sickly repugnance of the stomach. Any thing is good which effects our purpose, and the patient must never tire to try, until she has found what will suit her case. ArJ'se;fcum, every other night a dose (four glob.), will frequently restore appetite. Tihose who indulge in the eating of stronge and unusual articles, ought to be reminded that though a little to satisfy their craving might not do them any harm, a great quantity continted to be taken for a long time, will have a deleterious effect. Dr. Dewees relates a fact of this kind, where a l.dy diedl from the effects of eating chalk in too large quantities. if the appetite becomes too excessive, the bad consequences for tho systeml are not so trifling as persons might believe at first. Thlie various symptoms of repletion, congestions to the head, luilgs, and bowels, can take place; also head-ache, Wleeding of the nose. lungs, etc., beside a disordered state of thle dige-stive organs, not easily cured. In stch cases, it is well to use' food containing less nutriment in a greater bulk, sulh as rie,;arrowroot. farina, etc., which is still very cigestible.

This disease does not occur as often during pregnancy as constipation, but it is more injurious, because it weakens the system mo're, and needs, consequently immediate attention. There is one form of it which needs an especial description. Women of scrofulous constitution fiequently are very constipated during the whole period of pregnancy, until a few weeks before confinement, when all at once a diarrhea commences, which lasts fiom eight to ten days. During labor, and a few days after, they seem to be entirely free from it, but very soon afterward are attacked again, at which time the discharges, assume a purulent character, disclosing at once the presence of a fearful disease, ulceration of the bowels. At the same time, the secretion of milk has not been diminished, on the contrary, is increasing in quantity, and its quality rendered richer, so that the child thrives well, while the mother runs down, and if not relieved, will soon waste -away under hectic fever. The mouth becomes sore, very tender, easy to bleed; at that stage it is called \"nursizg sore mouth.\" This disease needs our closest attention. The strictest rest in a horizontal position, the mildest nourishment, such as farina, etc.; the exhibition of Nl.x vom. and Hepar., alternately in repeated doses (every three hours), generally relieves the patient in a few days, after which a few doses of Nitric acid will be sufficient to finish the cure. Other forms of diarrhea require remedies similar to those usually given, of which the reader will find the necessary information in other parts of the Domestic Physician, under the head of diarrhea. We mention here only the names of some of the most prominent. Antimon. crud., Ph]osphor2us, PFu[satilia, Mercury, Sepia. CONSTIPATION. A sluggish condition of the bowels is a frequent concomitant of pregnancy, caused by a combination of circumstances, occur [Page 468](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/470) 468 DISEA-SES OF FEMALES. ing at that period. A diet regulated especiially to countteract it,!the eat.ing of cooked, or ripe sweet fruit of different kinds, such as prunes, apples, etc., and the drinking fileely of cold wVote1,r, hbside active exercise in the open air,,vill be mostly ins;trumenta.:i to remove this difficulty. If t-hse'e nm s choild not succeed, recourse should be had to the following -emedicines for the use of vwhich a more specific reference can be found in th his Domestic P'hysician, in tho article on. constipation. One of the best means to overcome long-continued constipation, is the calternate use of -iAT/z von?., 0piul m an every three or four 3hours a dose (six glob.), until an cvacueition is cffeted; if it should be too tardy or insufficient, an injection of cold water will aid the effect of the medicine. Bryoosi and i'lcc tia will frequently suffice to remove constipation, if the bowels feel painful, and Lycopodiunm or Saltlph/u,'', if it has continued for a long time. DYSPEPSIA, ]HEART \u2014BURN, ACID STOATACH.'hese complaints, though not confined to pregnancy, nevertheless occur very frequently at that period, and particularly in t.hose persons who were troubled with them previously. T1his fict is exploined easily by the pressure which the enlarged uterus exerts on the stomach, especially in the latter months, thus interferiDg with digestion. NiC.x vton. and Pulsoatil/la are the principal remedies to regulate these disorders; the former, if they are attended with constipation, the latter, if with diarrhea. For an acid stomach, frequent but small quantities of lemonade, or a mixture of one drop of sulphuric acid in a tumbler of water, is highly recommended, and will, sooner and more lastingly, correct the acid in the stomach, than lime-water or magnesia, which at best only absorbs the acid present. not preventing thereby its new formation.

(Colic Pains.) Pains of this kind are generally of a neuralgic nature, and occur mostly during the first half of gestation, though cramps in the legs are witnessed during the whole term. Their treatment does not essentially vary friom that followed when present at any other time. In using external auxiliaries, such as warming bottles, hot bricks, blisters, etc., we would warn the reader not to apply them too hot, on account of the peculiar state of the patient, and if possible to do without them altogether, or to substitute bandages dipped in warm water, or a warm hip bath. Rubbing affords great relief, when the calves of the leg are cramped, or the pain in the back is very severe. The following medicines should be used, one at a time, dissolved in water, every half hour a teaspoonful, until better; if this is not the case within one or two hours, the next should be taken in the same manner. Cramps in the abdomen; Colocynth, Nux and painful urination are of frequent occurrence during pregnancy, caused not merely by rheumatic and gouty [Page 470](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/472) 4-70 DISEASES OF FEMALES. etc., as is com-.n,:l,y thle ca;c. but also by the plrcssu e difficult (and p-) ifiul.

Beside, the following remedies should be taken in their order, every two or three hours a dose (six glob.), until better. For OF URINE. A partial or total inability to retain the urine, is one of the most annoying complaints during pregnancy.

We mention this disease here, because during pregnancy, particularly toward its close, it sometinmes oc-curs, caused partly by mechanical pressure of the highly extended uterus upon the biliary duets, partly by the sympathetic influence, which gestation evidently shows even froonl its beginning on all the digestive orgoans, especially the live. I t is stated that jaundice more frequently occurs in winiter tlllln in summer, and oftener in blondes with.1 lymph tic, thall in brunettes with a sanguine temperament. Its cure consists in re-establishing, by dgrees. the healthy action of the skin by means of an even, warm temperature in a room, or still better in the bed; frequent tepidl sitting-u:,athls, wet bandages around the stomach, and the sweating in the wet sheet are powerful auxiliaries in the treatment of this disease; constipation is relieved by cold injections. Beside, the following remedies -should be given; three timnvs a day a dose (four glob.) of the remedy selected, for a few days until better. Jli-rcury and H/l)ar' in alternation; Larclwh.S's and S;.lpzhur alternately; and if caused by a fit of passion, Chawmomlio, and JueYx vein. in alternation.

This occurs, however, more in such women as have formerly been troubled with similar complaints. Difficulty of breathing, asthma, palpitation of the heart, and sometimes a hacking cough with spitting of blood, are the immediate consequences of these congestions. A great deal of care is needed on the part of the patient as regards diet and mode of living; what she eats must be of easy digestion, not much at a time, nor of a heating nature; she must avoid exposure to cold and dampness; attend carefully [Page 473](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/475) VERTIGTO \u2014CONGESTION OF TIlE HEAD. 473 to th;: selcetions of the skin, for which purpose she must dress warmlier than couimmon.

Asthlmt. \u2014 fainting and vertigo are frequent and sometimes very distressing ailments during pregnancy. They are caused by the plethora aLnd nervous irritability, which often accompany the functional processes during gestation; if they repeat too frequently and violently, they may even become dangerous. To prevent their recurrence, the patient must avoid all mental or physical excitement, follow the strictest hygienic rules in diet, and exercise, and keep the bowels in a good state, either by eating relaxing articles, or using injections. If the feet are cold, while the head is hot, a cold foot-bath every evening, with severe rubbing after it, is necessary; also a tepid sitz-bath in the morning, with rubbing after it. Almost the severest headache can be mitigated instantaneously by a hot hip-bath. FJainting is geherally relieved by loosening the clothes around the waist, a draft of fresh air, and sprinkling the face with cold water. Beside the above rules, the patient should take of the following remedies, every two or four hours a dose (four glob.), in their order, until better. 40 [Page 474](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/476) S)irits.-See Hysteria. Compare the same heading in another part of this book. NEURAILGIc PAINS. From the fact that the nervous system plays an important part in every thing connected with gestation, it is evident that we can expect neuralgic disorders in the organic and functional sphere during that period. This manifests itself particularly in organs below the diaphragm, where the uterus exerts its greatest influence. Neuralgie pains in the abdomen are very frequent; they appear under the short ribs, near the hips, or in the region of the bladder; it is generally a dull, heavy ache or burning, stinging in the muscles of the abdomen, remitting or intermitting as regards intensity. If the pains are felt within the abdomen, they resemble colic pains. Sometimes the neuralgy extends to the muscles of the small of the back, of the lower limbs, of the neck, arms and head; and if it affects the diaphragm or the pit of the stomach, the patient is taken with fits of laughing or crying, with spasmodic eructations of wind, sneezing, yawning, stretching and sighing. All these different complaints proceed from the same cause, viz: excessive nervous sensibility. If the extension of the uterus is very considerable, inclining too much in front, a circumstance which frequently causes distress, much may be done by applying a Itandage around the abdomen for support. Besides, the patient should wash frequently in cold water, and rub diligently the parts affected [Page 475](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/477) Pi'UERPEIAL C(ONUTVLSIOTONS. 475 with cold water, in order to strelgtlh(n them.

(_Eclaelaosia yrcavcidacrun.) This is perhaps the most dangerous disease to which pregnancy predisposes, and on this account its treatment should never be undertaken save by a skillful physician. We have introduced it herc solely for the purpose of making-the reader acquainted with the symptoms, particularly in the beginning of the convulsions, where a, prompt and energetic action sometimes will arrest their proogress. Dr. Meigs speaks as follows about this disease: \"It is a malady that is not met with every day-but it, is one so horrible in its appearance, so deadly in ils tendency, so embarrassing sometimes in its treatment, that, althoulgh it is not met with every day, it is solicitously expected, and probably obviated in many a case, which, but for such careful supervision, would swell its proportions in the statistical tables.\" We call these convulsions puerperal, because they can only effect in such a manimer women advanced in pregnancy, during labor, or in the first days of the lying-in. [Page 476](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/478) 47G DISEASES OF which nmoe ~vithoCtl- tAi meanltinga (.f the word eclampsia. Dr. MAei:s considers the following to be the most important p-i(emonitory signs: \" Women with short necks; those who are fat; those who possess considerabie muscular strength; those whose tissues are firm, solid, hard and un:yielding; those that are of a sanguine-nervous temperament; those who have swollen feet and hands, and such as'upon waking in the morning complain of numbness. in the hands and bloating of the features; those who are affeeted with a feeling of great weakness or with loss of sensation in one side of the ftace, or in one of the Imembers; those who have suddenly lost their hearing; those who have vertigo, headache, flashing of light within the eyes, dimaness of sight, double vision or half sight; those who have sudden loud inoises in the ears, (and such as feel as if a violent blow had been received upon the head; those, furthermore, who labor under intense anramia, with distension of the blood-vessels and heart,\" and we might add, those who constitutionally can not bear the slightest degree of pain without a severe shock to the nervous system-\" all such are to be held liable, and closely observed and protected,\" Puerperal convulsions are similar in appearance to other convulsions; spasms of the muscles in every part of the system, foaming at the mouth, spasmodic breathing, and above all, unconsciousness. There a-re two kinds, the nervous and sanguineous, as they are called; in tihe former the face remains pale until toward the last, when it assumes a bluish color; in the latter, the face appears from the first very much bloated and swollen, dark red; this kind bears bleeding from the arm or foot in the commencement, while in the former it would not be advisable to bleed. In both it is advisable to use mustard drafts on the calves of the legs, allowing them to draw for at least half an hour; to put cold water or ice on the head and [Page 477](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/479) MISCARRIAGE. 477 have the bowels moved by one or more injections of salt and water; at the same time the exhibition of remedies must not be neglected.

(Abortions.) Miscarriage can take place at any time between the first and seventh month. If it occurs after the seventh, it is no longer so called, but premature birth; as at this period the child can be saved, and the object of pregnancy be gained, to give birth to a living child. But if the child is born before the seventh nonth, it can not live; thence the name \"mniscarriage.\" The more advanced the pregnancy is, the less is the danger which might result from a miscarriage. The oftener a woman has miscarried, the more her constitution inclines to new misfortunes of the same kind. M3iscarriages are more liable to occur again at the same time of pregnancy at which the former or last one happened; if once past that period, the danger to miscarry diminishes. Miscarriage can become a habit; it sometimes appears epidemically, in so far, at least, as in certain seasons the uterine congestion generally increases (menses appear more frequently and profusely, hemorrhages take place spontaneously, etc.), and in the same ratio, the possibility and occurrence of abortion multiplies.-': I observed this phenomenon, on the approach of the Asiatic cholera in Cincirnati, in De uember, 1848, When there was a sensible - il'.;. t{718 DISEASES OF FEMALES. If a woman approaches the time where formerly she had miscarried, she must be careful not to provoke a return by walking great distances, lifting, running down stairs, riding over a rough road, etc. These practices might excite at any time a miscarriage in females who never were predisposed to it; certainly much more in those already predisposed. A weakening, luxurious mode of living, late hours, great mental excitement, are causes of miscarriage, and must be srtictly avoided. In fact any important irregularity in diet or mode of living, may produce abortion; its causes are numerous, and frequently even form part of a woman's every day habit. For instance, tight-lacing, dancing at evening parties and the excitement so studiously sought in our modern society. All these artificial means of producing life's fleeting pleasures should be disregarded by one who soon will feel the more lasting joys of a, mother; for the sake of reaching that exalted happiness, she should cheerfully forego for a short time, the fashionable and doubtful amusements of so-called fashionable society. Yet there are some characters so destitute of all maternal feelings and so infatuated with the ease and luxury of high life, that they are sadly aggrieved as soon as they know they are enciente. They know what is before them; they will have to deny themselves in many things; wealth, of which they have so much, is unable to buy a release from nature in that of miscarriages and hemorrhages of every kind, increasing during the spring of 1849, and the most frequent in July and August, when the cholera was raging the most fearfully. Women miscarried at this time who never before had had any predisposition to it, although imothers of many children; premature births occurred without any apparent cause, bodily or mentally. After that time, the tide of the disease turned, and with it the abortions decreased in number; also, other kinds of hemorrhages. Undoubtedly, the small quantity of positive electricity in the atmosphere; caused a general debility in the nervous system, and consequent muscular and vascular laxity, which even involved, in its general effects, the uterus in all its functions. HIence the epidemical appearance of abortions. Such facts must only be known and recognized as such, and it becomes an easy task to prevent misfortume. [Page 479](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/481) MISCARRIAGE. 479 respect. Knowing that they can not escape the natural destiny of woman, they frequently conceive the unnatural thought to deprive nature of its legitimate iright by producing abortion artificially, either in exposing themselves to violent exercise or by taking certain drugs, which, as they have been informed, will excite an early miscarriage. It can not be denied that a. low state of morals like this, does exist, even in the highest circles of society, where wealth is abundant to sust'ain the gifts of nature, and such barbarous conduct can not be excused by ignorance or poverty. But seldom, we may say never, can they accomplish their criminal purpose without endangering, in the highest degree, their own lives and health. No nmedicine which is powerful enough to produce abortion, can do it without first poisoning the whole system by passing through the stomach and the blood-vessels of the abdomen to the uterus; it will sooner destroy the life of these organs, than affect the purpose in view. If such desire is already criminal. its execution must be doubly so, because it adds the attempt at suicide to that of destroying the life of an unborn inf-int. It is not so easy to sever the bonds existing between mother -and child, if both are well and the former has no peculiar predisposition fior miscarriagne. It is this latter only whlichl allows the imost triflinz accident soimetimes to prodiuce an abortion, while in femttles who have no such susceptibility. the s. ver-st misfortunes leave the infant in the uterus untouched and unhurt. The premonitory symptoms of a miscarriage.re: chilliness, followed by fever and bearing down sensation, which afterward increases to labor pains; cutting, drawing, mostly in the loins and abdomen. A discharge of bright-red blood either immediately issues from the vagina, or coagulated, dark blood appears from time to time; firequent repetitions of these efforts of nature are usually necessary to expel the fetus; varying in duration fromn two hours to two days. TREATMENT. \u2014As soon as the above symptoms appear, even in a slichter degree, the patient must lie down and keep [Page 480](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/482) 480 DISEASES OF FEMALES. perfectly quiet, without moving. She should be placed upon a nlattrass or any thing harder and cooler than a feather bed. The room should have plenty of fresh air; doors and windows should be open for that purpose. Hler drink must be cool toastwater, lemonade, ice-water, etc., and in giving it to her, care must be taken that the patient does not exert herself in receiving it; her position on the couch or bed should be strictly horizontal; it is rather better if her feet are slightly elevated. No stimulating food or drink is allowed except when complete exhaustion from loss of blood supervenes, at which time small qufntitics of wine may be given (see Flooding). The covering of the patient must be thin but sufficient. Great care should be taken to prevent officiousness on the part of nurses and friends, who by conversation and over-kindness, disturb the rest of the patient. Under no circumstances dare a conduct like this be tolerated; complete rest being necessary for the patient, we must procure it for her, even at the risk of giving offense to those who fancy they have the right of showing kindness to the sufferer by doing her positive harm. If the attack is brought on by mechanical injury, a fall, blow, imisstep, or walking, lifting, etc., take AreIica. Twelve globules dissolved in half a teacupful of water, every fifteen or twenty minutes a teaspoonful, until better, or until after one hour another remedy becomes necessary. Seccle will be the next remedy to be given, in the same manner as Arwlica, particularly in femarles who have miscarried more than once; in older ones, or in those who have a weak and exhausted constitution, when the discharge consists of dark, liquid blood, and the pains are but slight. Chicea, in alternation with Secale, becomes necessary, when the loss of blood is considerlable, and weakness and exhaustion evidently increase; buzzing in the ears; cloudiness of sight; loss of consciousness; fainting when raising from the pillow. Hkoscyanmzts, if the patient falls into spasms or convulsions [Page 481](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/483) MISCARRIAGE. 481 of the whole body, with loss of consciousness, discharge of light, red blood, worse at night.

ARtfer the fetus has been expelled. the bleeding generally stops, and no further treatment is necessary, but the one commonly followed in a regular birth. The patient needs the same length of ti.me to recover, and the same careful watching as during the lying-in. Indeed, it is advisable to keep in bed long:r than common, in order to give the uterus a better chance to recover from the shock, and become stronger, also to avoid those dis ases caused by weakness of the pelvic organs, such as prolapsus uteri. fluor albus, etc., which so often follow a misctrriage or regular birth if badly treated. Miscarriage must not be considered as a slight disorder; its consequences upon the system are sometimes fearful. As an interruption of the natural olrder, we can easily imagine that its effects upon the system must be more distressing than a regular birth, which is but a fulfillment of a natural development. Do not neglect to procure a physician, if possible, immediately. N. B.

PARTURITION. 7REGULAR BIRTTH. This is a strictly physiological process, not requiring any more interference than is necessary for the sake of comfort a-ind cleanliness. There are, however, many circumstances conne t d with this process, which formerly were considered and treated so differently from what they are at the present day, that it is very desirable to make the reader acquainted with the most approved methods and practices now in vogue during and after parturition. What we intend to say on this subject is not merely a recital of opinion, but has been found practically efficacious by us in hundreds of cases. Within the last thirty years the views on the treatment of women in labor and childbed hlave changed materially, and we are happy to say decidedly for the better. Before that time it was considered dangerous to allow fresh air or cold water to a woman in labor or after delivery, lest she contract diseases of all kinds. Now both, are considered indispensable preventives and valua.ble remedial auxiliaries in the cure of those same diseases. Notwithstanding the slow progress which medical reform has made in certain classes of physicians, it is not to be doubted that in obstetrics even the most virulent opposers of reform in medicine have generally yielded with a praiseworthy zeal. Scarcely a physician of any denomination will be found, at present, advocating the old practices, whereby the natural process in labor or childbed is so much and so often interfered with, that disease and death may be the result. If a diarrhea precede the commencement of labor, as it sometimes does within the last-few days of pregnancy, it is best not to interfere with it, as its effect will be rather beneficial than otherwise. It is usually caused by a nervous agitation, fear, etc., which frequently is relieved by looseness of the bowels. [Page 483](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/485) LABOR. 483 At the same time other nervous symptoms may manifest themselves, such as depression of spirits, a whining mood, a disposition to shed tears, fear of not surviving the labor and birth of the child, etc. Aconite and Opizum will be sufficient to quiet the nervous system; let the patient take, evening and morning, alternately, a dose (six glob.), until better. The real labor is near at hand, as soon as a slight discharge of mucus tinged with blood appears-the so-called \"show \"which is a favorable sign at the beginning of labor. The less we interfere with the action of nature during parturition, the easier will be its termination; the closer we follow the general laws of health during pregnancy, labor and childbed, the less sickness will attend women and infants. During labor our duty should be, in a great measure, directed to the arrangement of the outward circumstances, which exert such a great influence on its progress. For this purpose the bed of the patient should be placed so, that it allows of free access on all sides; it should consist, if possible, of a mattress, which is preferable to feathers. The room should be well ventilated, and provision made to have plenty of fresh air, when needed. The patient should have as much cold water as she desired, before, during and after labor; a denial in this respect would act very injuriously. We will now consider the different stages of parturition, their normal or abnormal condition, and treatment. LABOR. Labor is the term by which we express the process of nature to expel the contents of the womb. Labor-pains, or contractions of the womb, are the natural means to accomplish this object; they are consequently indispensable to the object in view, and a woman in labor should never consider her pains, although disagreeable, in any other than this lighl-t, else she might fret and whine herself sick without use, and thus deprive the most salutary provision in her condition of a part of its [Page 484](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/486) 484 DISEASES OF FEMALES. great benefit. Every expulsive effort of nature is connected with a certain degree of painful exertion, mingled with a feeling of ease and repose, which takes away, in a great measure, the severity of real pain. An analogous sensation may be experienced by the muscular contractions of the rectum and colon, which occur in intervals, thus permitting a grateful feeling of repose to intervene. Labor may be divided into natural or preternatural, according to its own or the character of attending circumstances. If the labor is just sufficiently strong to expel the contents of the womb within a moderate time, without manual interference, and without danger either to the mother or child, we call it natural labor. On the contrary, if it is protracted, difficult, too painful or inefficient on account of its own weakness, or the presentation of parts which hinder its efficacy; if it is attended with other serious disorders, such as convulsions, hemorrhages, lacerations of the uterus or other contiguous parts, we call it preternatural labor. Labor consists in the frequently repeated contractions of the uterus, aided by those of the surrounding muscles, by which expulsatory efforts the mouth of the womb gradually enlarges, the vagina widens, and thus the child is forced through the extended passage. From the above it is evident, that if no mechanical impediment either from the structure of the pelvis or the position or size of the child interferes, the labor will be sufficient in almost all cases to accomplish the object of nature without real danger. The time in which natural labor usually terminates varies; may be put down, however, from six to eight hours as the average duration. The labor at the birth of a first child often lasts longer, but is on that account not more dangerous. Its duration, however, is somewhat more protracted, since the parts have never heretofore been expanded. The attending persons should in such cases be especially kind and patient. [Page 485](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/487) SPURIOUS OR FALSE LABOR-PAINS. 485 SPURIOUS OR FALSE sLABOR-PAINS. We call those pains spurious or false, which do not exert an expelling power on the uterus, although resembling in other respects the true labor-pains; the difference between them is so great, that the patient herself can not mistake it.'he true labor-pains begin either in the lower part of the abdomen, in the region of the bladder, thence passing backward toward the spine, or they start in the back and shoot thence around to the front. Another still more certain sign of true pains is the cessation of all pain between two attacks, while the false laborpains do not cease entirely. Spurious pains, being caused by nervous or rheumatic disorders, can appear in any part of the system, but very seldom stay long in one place; they may be in the back, loins or front, wandering from one place to another like rheumatism or neuralgia. They are soon dispelled by Pulsatilla, every fifteen minutes a dose (six glob.), the patient keeping as quiet as possible and well covered, to get warm and perspiring. Sometimes Chamomile is necessary, if the patient does not perspire much. Nux vori. is the most suitable remedy, when there is a pain as if from a bruise in the region of the bladder, or a constant but insufficient urging to stool; also when the woman is of an impatient, passionate temperament, having been inclined to the use of stimulants, wine, coffee, etc. Bryonvia, when the pains mostly lodge in the small of the back, and increase by motion, with irritability of temper, con. stipation, and congestion of the head; in the latter case alternately with Aconite particularly in women of a plethoric con. stitution, with a full, bounding pulse, flushed face, hot and dry skin. Belladonna, alternately with Aconite, particularly when the head is hot and the feet are cold; the pains resemble spasms. [Page 486](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/488) 4-86 DISEASES OF FEMALES. lynatia, when the pains are connected with great depression of spirits, and require frequent change of position, which mitigates their severity. EXCESSIVELY PAINFUL LABOR. The true labor-pains sometimes may become too violent, and following each other in quick succession, cause such great agitation and restlessness, as to render their mitigation necessary. This can be effected by the use of the following remedies. Coffea and Aconite alternately, every ten minutes a dose (four glob.), until better, or the next remedy is indicated. For nervous trembling, fear and anlieiy, before or dTuring labor-pains: Aeon., C3.ff:, Bellad., yIgnat. Chamomile, if the mind is greatly excited, the pains are intolerable; the woman very sensitive and impatient. Belladonna, under the same symptoms, particularly when, with heat in the head, the feet are cold; is also beneficial in cases of first labor, where the unyielding state of the parts produces these extra exertions of nature. Atx. voem., in cases similar to Chamomile, but with a constant, ineffectual urging to stool. Toward the close of labor, the Sulphuric Ether may be applied to mitigate the severity of the pains; do not let a candle be near the Ether. PROTRACTED LABOR. If the pains continue too long, say from twenty-four to thirty-six hours, labor becomes preternatural, and needs an especial treatment. We have to consider the causes which may produce this unusual delay. They are various, and most of them of such a nature as only au experienced midwife or physician is competent to remove. We will speak here of such as safely can come within reach of domestic help, being caused mostly by a mismanagement of labor in its early stages, or by a constitutional peculiarity of the patient, which can be remedied. [Page 487](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/489) PTOTRACTEI) LABOR. 487 It is not unusual, however, that women in their first confileneeint experience a more than commonly protracted labor; this need not give rise to fear of danger, especially not if the Vw<1 1:nm is otherwise strong and healthy, as such ones more than the wNveakly. nervous women offer the greatest resistance to the cxpulsivc cfIorts of labor. If the woman has been urged to support the pains by exeitions of her own at the very beginning of labor, thus exhaustiny her strength at a time when such efforts can be of no avail, it will frequently be found that toward the middle or close of the ltbor, when she ought to support it. she flafgs in strength, and from sheer exhaustion is unable to bear down or facilitate the expulsion of the child. In such cases, labor becomes protracted, anod the only means of correcting it, consists in making the patient omit for some time her efforts, until she has gained more strength; during this rest broth or wine in small quantities should be given to her. If great restlessness has produced a high degree of nervous excitement, impeding often the progress of labor, the exhibition of CIf(rt and Aconite is indicated, in intervals of ten or fifteen minutes, a dose (four glob.); B:lladonna should be given if the head is hot and the feet are cold; and LNux vor,7., if the restlessness is connected with expressions of impatience. At the s-me time she should be exhorted to lie more quiet, and be covered well, in order to excite perspiration on the skin, when the latter is dry and husky. If during the early part of labor, warm drinks (green, 1or chamomile, tea.) had been freely given, by the use of which relaxation of the system and protracted labor had been produced, it is necessary to change. giving the patient cold water when thirsty, beside Coffcia and China, antidotes to green tea; _Iqnltia and Iullsatilklt. antidotes to Chamomile tea. Warrm drinks ought never to be given during labor, even if it is severe. The cold drinlk, especially cold water, has a contracting effect, and thus makes labor-pains more vigorous. [Page 488](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/490) 488 DISEASES OF FEMALES. ABSENCE OR SUDDEN CESSATION OF LABOR-PAINS. If they cease at once, either from firight or some other emotion, and the patient exhibits symptoms of congfestion of the head, with red and bloated face, sopor, loud breathing, like snoring, Opium, every ten minutes a dose (four globules), should be administered. If upon the cessi:tion of labor-pains, spasmodic distress in different parts of the body appears, Pulsatilla should be given, in the same manner. If they cease in women naturally feeble and exhausted, Secale is the best remedy to revive both the strength of the patient and the pains. It must be given in the same mranner. If protracted labor is caused by mechanical impedime nts, too narrow pelvic passage, abnormal position or unusual si:ze of the child, manual assistance is necessary. which can;be rendered only by competent persons. Convulsions occurriing during labor very seldom retard its progress; they should, however, be treated forthwith, as stated on page 489. Too SUDDEN TERMINATION OF LABOR. Labor too quickly terminated, say in half an hour or less, is considered unfavorable for both the health of the mother and child. As regards the former, the chances for a sufficient and healthful contraction of the womb, so essential to avert cdinger of hemorrhage and after-diseases, are diminished by a labor too quickly terminated. To prevent the bad consequences in this respect the woman should confine herself to a horizontal position for a longer time than usual, and apply frequent coo sponging-baths, in order to strengthen the parts, weakened by the too sudden termination of the birth. T'I'he danger for the child consists in the mechanical injuries it may receive by falling on the floor, etc., if the labor should terminate so fast as not to allow the woman time of reaching a bed or couch. Cases of this kind have occurred; though very rare they may occur again. A woman having experienced too sudden labor, [Page 489](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/491) CRLAMPS. CONVULSIONS. SPASMODIC PAINS. 489 should the next time, toward the end of pregnancy, avoid exercising severely, and going up and down stairs; she should not omit to lie down frequently for a few hours and wash her stomach, back and hips once or twice a day in cold *ater. By this process the muscular fibres of these parts near the uterine region are strengthened so as to offer a greater resistance during parturition. (CRAPS,. CONvULSIONs. SPASMIODIC PAINS.

[Page 490](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/492) 4 90 DISEASES OF FEMIALES. TaHE WATERS. (Child's Wraler.) At every birth a certain quantity of water is discharged during labor and after the child is born. This is the fluid which during pregnancy surrounds the child and is contained within the membranes, where it evidently has been placed by a wonderful provision of nature for the protection of the child as well as the mother. For the latter it is of the utmost service during labor, as it furnishes the best means of dilating the mouth of the womb in the beginning of parturition. When the mouth of the womb opens, the membranes are forced into the opening at every pain, forming a bag filled with the water, pressing on all points, evenly and gradually like an elastic wedge, possessing the mildest and surest power. As soon as the opening thus made, is large enough for the child's head to enter, the rupture of the membranes usually takes place, which causes so much of the water to escape as is contained in the bag, serving to lubricate the lower parts which now shall undergo the great distension. Much of the water, however, is still retained in the womb, which, during succeeding labor, serves the same purpose, softening and lubricating the parts, and rendering the descending head moist and slippery.'IThus is this wonderful process, the birth of a chi!d, facilitated immeasurably by the simple but effective agency of this lin-pid fluid. The immense benefit derived from the waters for this purpose, becomes sadly apparent when we have to witness labor which is deprived of its aid. Sometimes the waters break too early and then they escape entirely, causing what is called a \"dry birth.\" In such a cace labor will always be very protracted and painful. To mitigate its severity, we have to supply what by accident or misfortune has been lost. We either inject sweet oil or thin, sweet gooseoil in the vagina, or apply it there from time to time on the points of the fingers. This circumstance also teaches us the great lesson, never break the waters too soon by artificial means. If it becomes necessary, we should wait until the opening of the os uteri is sufficiently enlarged to allow the head to enter when the water has escaped from the bag. As the membranes around the child are composed of a double lining, it often occurs that between them a quantity of water accumulates, which is in no connection with the true waters contained within the inner membrane next to the child. This so-called false water frequently escapes long before the termination of gestation, in fact it can do so at any time, in which case it seldom fails to frighten the woman, exciting in her the apprehension of abortion or premature birth. The above explanation of this circumstance should dispel her fears, especially if she recollects that such a discharge of false water never is accompanied with labor-pains. The quantity of the waters varies; it is sometimes very great, causing even suspicion of dropsy or the presence of twins. DELIVERY The most agonizing so-called \"cutting pains,\" occur just before delivery; they are of short duration, however, and of such a nature that, although extremely painful, they do not weaklen, but, on the contrary, strengthen the patient, by arousing her energy to the utmost. At that time we frequently hear her cry out at the top of the voice, \"Oh, I must die! I must die! \" These words must not frighten those in attendance. It is true they are expressions of agony, but they do not indicate danger; they are rather of good import. signifying the effective progress of the birth. Kind, consoling words, stating that now the labor soon would terminate, etc., are the best remedy at this juncture of the case. Just when the child is appearing, the attendant should support the region underneath its head to prevent a tearing of the tightly drawn skin at that point; this can be done with the [Page 492](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/494) 492 DISEASES OF FEMALES. open palm of the hand, pressed yieldingly underneath the head where it bulges out the most. TREATMENT AFTER DELIVERY. After delivery, but while the after-birth is still remaining within the womb, it is our duty to examine the uterine region outside, to make ourselves sure of the sufficient contraction of the womb, which, if rightly contracted, can at that time be felt hard as a stone, above the bladder, about the size of an infant's head. If not contracted, this lump can not be felt, in which case we must either suspect another child within the womb or have to fear that by an internal hemorrhage, the womb has expanded again. In the former case the abdomen will feel quite large, and parts of the child yet unborn, are distinguishable through the walls of the abdomen, while in the latter, the womb will not extend as much but feel more yielding and soft. This last circumstance requires immediate, gentle, but firm and gradually increasing pressure with, and rubbing of the hand, which must be continued until the womb contracts anew, growing less in size and harder to the touch. AFTER-BIRTH. If the child cries lustily, it may be removed soon by cutting the navel string three inches from its body, but not before it has been ascertained that the navel string does not any more pulsate. As long as the beating of a pulse can be felt in any portion of the navel-string, it must not be cut; a few minutes detention on this account will never be of any injury, but may be of great benefit to the infant. The beating l:egins to cease first in that part of the string nearest the mother, and diminishes gradually toward the navel of the child. Wherever it has disappeared, the cord may be severed; even if it is too long at first it -can be shortened afterward at leisure. Before the cut is made (generally about three inches from the navel of the child), tie two strings made of firm yarn or cord, tightly [Page 493](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/495) HEMORRHAGE-FLOODING AFTER DELIVERY. 493 around the navel string, allowing an inch of room between them; in this place the cut should be made either with a pair of scissors or a good sharp knife, being careful, however, that no other parts of the infant's body are hurt by the operation. After the child is removed, it may be ascertained how far the after-birth has been expelled, and whether far enough to allow of an easy removal. If, on examination, it is found to lie within the vagina, it can at once be grasped with the hand and extracted; but if the cord reaches higher than the upper part of the vagina, and its connection with the placenta can not be felt, it is highly improper to seek its expulsion by force applied to the cord. The after-birth is expelled frotm the womb by labor-pains, and if these have ceased for a while after the expulsion of the child, without having effected that of the placenta, it is proper and more safe to await the return of the after-pains, which in due time will make their appearance. They may be hastened by rubbing and gently pressing the abdomen externally, over the region of the womb, exciting thereby this organ to new contraction. After a few pains of this kind, the placenta will often be found lying within the grasp of the fingers; at any rate but very slight tractions carefully made, will be sufficient to bring it down. This is all the manual assistance which persons not initiated in the art of obstetrics dare undertake as regards the removal of an afterbirth. In most cases it should not be removed so quickly; there is at least sufficient time to wait for the arrival of a competent person. Meanwhile.Pulsatilla alternately with Secale, every half hour a dose (four glob.), may be given, which frequently will hasten its expulsion. If the patient's head is congested, face full and red, give of Belladonna four globules, in preference to the above remedies. HEMORRHAGE \u2014FLOODING AFTER DELIVERY. The only danger, perhaps, which may threaten women during and shortly after the birth of a child, is that which results [Page 494](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/496) 494 DISEASES OF1 FEMALES. from flooding.'Yet, carefully managed, this will not occur very frequently, nor be so very dangerous. A great deal can be done to avoid it. One of the most frequent causes of hemorrhage after delivery is mental excitement, either of a joyous or sad nature. Sometimes the husband, overjoyed at the safe delivery of his wife, expresses his own feelings in a too exciting manner, which causes like emotions in the fatigued patient; or the latter becomes suddenly very depressed in spirits on being told the sex of the infant, herself having expected it to be the opposite. Excitement of any kind must be carefully kept, at this period, from the patient. She needs complete rest of body and mind; sleep is the best restorer of strength, and the patient may indulge in it one hour after the birth of the child. After delivery and the removal of the placenta, the woman should lie perfectly quiet for the first eight or ten hours, with the knees close together, well covered up to her chin, in order to keep up the perspiration excited on her skin during the preceding hard labor. A sudden cooling down sometimes produces a chill, with other bad consequences. When thus carefully covered, the nurse should wash the abdomen and other parts with moderately cool water without uncovering her, and if there is a tendency to a greater discharge from the womb than common, put a cold water bandage over the region of the womb, changing it whenever it becomes warm. Even if no flooding is threatening, a wet compress under the bandage commonly applied, will be a cooling and pleasant appliance, restorative in the highest degree, and preventing the abdomen from remaining afterward too pendulous. If flooding should occur, rub the region over the womb, using steady and powerful friction with the hand, until the womb contracts again, and after-pains appear, which diminish the danger of flooding; besides give the patient Belladonna if she has a great deal of bearing down. [Page 495](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/497) AFTER-PAINS. 495 Chamomile if her limbs are cold and she has pains around the abdomen. Chi na and Ipecac. alternately, in the worst cases, when the above remedies do not succeed; or Puidsatilla, if a discharge of clotted blood appears at intervals, ceases and re-appears; followed by Crocus, Platina and Sa bina. As the last and surest remedy, apply the coldest water in wet compresses, renewed every minute, or pounded ice on the abdomen; this will soon stay the flooding permanently, except when caused by parts of the after-birth being yet in the womb. AFTER-PAINS. Women, during the first confinement, experience, very seldoml, after-pains. They are mostly caused by the renewed efforts of contraction in the womb, dilated from time to time by the clots of blood oozing from the parts where the afterbirth adhered. This may last a few hours or many days, just as the case may be. The following remedies will mitigate their severity, particularly if they are of a rheumatic or spasmodic origin, as is sometimes the case. _Arnica is the first medicine, externally in a wash on the generative parts, and internally in globules; it sooths the irritability of the womb, after severe labor. Alternately with it, give Pu7satdl/a, every two or three hours a dose (four globules), which regulates the uterine contractions. Charmozile and Nlitx vorm. in alternation, in the same manner, if the pains are very pressing, producing impatience and irritability, with frequent but ineffectual urging to stool. Coifea and Aconite, in the same manner, alternately; if severity of the pains drive the patient almost to despair. Secale in weakly females or those who have already had many children. Belladonna, if the pains are attended with much bearing [Page 496](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/498) 496 DISEASES OF FEMALES. down, congestion to, and heat in the head, flushed face, coldness of the feet, tenderness and fullness of the abdomen, in alternation with Opium, if the patient has an unusual disposition to sleep and stupor, during which her breathing is loud and snoring, only now and then interrupted by the severe after-pains. Sometimes the application of the cold, cool or warm shallowbath, as circumstances may require, will be of great benefit; also the wet bandage around the abdomen. CONFINEMENT-ITS DURATION AND MANAGEMENT. This term signifies the lying-in of a woman for a certain length of time, during which she shall recruit and recover her former strength and health. In a perfectly natural state of society, and under circumstances where the physical power of woman is not marred, the time of confinement needs to be but veryv short. Indeed there are cases on record where women have been able the next day after delivery to attend to their duties partially, and in a few days afterward altogether. But such iron constitutions can not be expected to exist in our artificial state of society. We are consequently compelled to adopt rules which will prevent the many disorders which may befall debilitated constitutions after delivery, if not carefully attended. Our modern Hygiene has made great reforms, also, in this period of female development, and women are less longer now confined to their rooms than they were in former times, and we may, if we continue to live more in accordance with nature, arrive at still greater results. Water, fresh air and exercise will yet work miracles. At the present time we hold it still necessary for the mother to remain in bed for the first five or six days, after which she may sit up awhile, at first in bed, gradually lengthening the time, until she can sit up at the end of two weeks altogether. Circumstances, of course, will modify the above. The greatest danger, however, which can arise in this period, is generally caused by excitement of the mind, variously induced. The [Page 497](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/499) DIET DURING CONFINEMENT. 497 principal fault ill this respect, consists in allowing friends and n:ighrlbo!rs to pty lengthy visits to the patient. Velpeau, a grea ~ obstetri;ian, speaks about this bad fashion as follows: \" It is important that the patient should neither speak nor be sponca to, except when necessary. A calm state of the mind and repose of the body are so irdispensable, that too much care can not be taken to remove every cause that. might interfere wit h them. MIost of the diseases which affect a woman in childbed, may be attributed to the thousands of visits of friends, neighbiors or acquaintance, or the ceremony with which she is too often oppressed; she wishes to keep up the conversation; her mind becomes excited, the fruit of which is headache and agitation; the slightest indiscreet word worries her; the slightest motives of joy agitate her in the extreme; the least opposition instantly makes her uneasy, and I can affirm that amnong the numerous cases of puerperal fever met with at the Hiospital de Perfectionnement, there are very few whose origin is unconnected with some moral commotion.\" Before the fourteenth day, therefore, visitors should not be admitted off any consider2ation. The risk is too great. DIET DURING CONFINEMENT. The diet during this time should receive our attention, but not with a view to cut short the allowance, or confine its quality to the mere dainties or so-called light food. Our opinion in this respect may differ somewhat from those who believe that a woman in confinement, although weakened by the whole process of delivery, by loss of blood and a great flow of milk, could subsist more comfortably, and gain strength, on light diet than strong, nourishing food. Our rule has been to let her desire alone in this respect. to let her choose her own diet, if no existing disorder will dictate otherwise. A healthy woman can relish and bear usual food the next day after delivery, as well as at any other time, and it is folly to make her starve at a time when she needs food the most. It is well enough not to 42 [Page 498](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/500) 498 DISEASES OF FEMALES. allow her to eat too much at a time, nor partake of any stimulating substances, either in food or drink; even tea or coffee may be better replaced by cold water. The room should be aired daily once or twice; the curtains around the bed should be such as to allow free circulation. Cleanliness in every particular should be observed. The bowels are naturally constipated for the first four or five days after delivery. If, after the lapse of that time it is necessary to interfere, give a few doses of Opium and Nux. vome., in alternation, every three hours a dose (six glob.); if head and limbs ache, give Bryonia in the same manner. At the same time apply a few injections of cold water. Under no consideration whatever, give her cathartic medicine, the use of which is in no case more superfluous and hazardous. Stewed prunes or other relaxing dried fruit, will be equally efficacious and more harmless than physic. LOCHIAL DISCHARGE. After the delivery of the placenta, the womb does not immediately re-assume its former size and consistence; this reduction is the work of time, and, as it progresses, produces what is called the lochia or lochial discharge-liquids which ooze from the walls of the uterus into its cavity, whence they escape through the vagina. Through this process the womb gradually is reduced in size and its loose texture becomes firmer again, until a normal size and consistence is regained. The first two or three days this discharge consists of blood, partially coagulated; while the milk appears in the breasts, a more serous liquid is discharged, more or less tinged with blood; finally, on the sixth or seventh day, the flow becomes whitish or purulent, of a thicker consistence. This may last variously, from two or three to twenty days. It is evident, that a process like this can be disturbed either by general or local causes, operating upon the womb, from which, as from a sponge, these liquids are pressed. If the womb inflames or is congested, its contracting [Page 499](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/501) LOCHIAL DISCHARGE. 499 movement is impeded, consequently the discharge will cease; if the blood is constitutionally vitiated, its serum, as it oozes into the cavity of the womb, will be bad also, becoming sanious, thin, watery, of greenish color and bad smell, or a tedious suppurative process may take place, by which nature seeks to counteract the retarding influence of a bad constitution. Our remedies in such cases are intended to support struggling nature in the restoration of the natural discharge, as the best indication of the healthful action of the womb. Irregularities of the lochial discharge during the presence of other diseases, such as childbed fever, etc., can only disappear after their cure, and require our attention in so far as they are symptoms of these diseases, to which we refer the reader. Suppression of lochia, in consequence of congestion or inflammation of the womb, can occur after exposures to cold, errors of diet, mental emotions, sudden joy, fear or grief, etc.; chilliness, fever, sometimes delirium, thirst, headache, pains in the back and limbs generally accompany a suppression of the lochia. If high fever is present, with congestion of the head, delirium, etc., give Aconite and Belladolnna, in alternation, particularly if there are delirium and violent pains in the head and back, with pressure in the genital organs, as if they would be thrust out, every two or three hours a dose (four glob.), until better; if not relieved, give Bryonia alternately with Aconite, and if no improvement follows, the fever continuing, in alternation with Putlsatilla, as above, especially when mental excitement of some kind or exposure to cold preceded the affection. Ieratrum, after indigestion, with rush of blood to the head, delirium, and palpitation of the heart, every two hours a dose. Opuitum and Aconite alternately, as above, if sudden fright was the cause. Dulcamara and Pulsatillct, if no fever is present, and the suppression was caused by exposure to dampness and cold. CflTea and Chamomnlile, alternately, if the patient is highly excited and unable to bear the pains; restless and impatient.

Diet must be very nourishing; patient must have plenty of fresh air, if possible, in high, dry locations. SECRETION OF MILK-MILK FEVER. Milk may appear in the breasts long before the termination of pregnancy; usually it makes its appearance the third day after delivery, in most cases gently and without much disturbance of the general health; but sometimes uncer a storm of [Page 501](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/503) DETERIORATION OF MILK. 501 excitemet in the vascular and nervous system, which is called m';li.: jevee'. After a severe chill, which penetrates the whole body, a violent fever appears, with headache, congestion to the bl: in and chest, which produces difficult respiration; during tlis time the breasts begin to swell and the patient perceives the s;.hot/ng it, of the milk; the breasts become now tender'Ilcd liand l''. Altlohugoi this fever soon may disappear, it is desirable to m'it igat its seve'ity. which can. be done by a few doses of l -c:i e. every hour or two a dose (four glob). As soon as the patifnlt begins to perspire, most of the above symptoms will cec zse; if they should not. give Biyonic., if the head and back sti!! a1he or there is great oppression at the chest. If the head. however, is the principal seat of distress, particularly if the patient can not bear the light, give Belladonna in the samle manner. If the breasts are very tender to the touch, the patie.nt is very restless and much excited, give Coffea, and hcom 7ll..ie in alternation, every hour a dose (four glob.), until better. Pulsatztilz.a is particularly indicated when the breasts are very much distended, feel very sore, and rheumatic pains extend to the muscles of the chest and shoulders; it should be given every three hours a dose (four glob). Give.Byonia and -Rhls alternately, every two hours a dose (four glob.), if the tongue is coated and the back and limbs continue to ache, after the fever has disappeared. External applications are of not much use during a milk fever, except, perhaps, a compress dipped in hot wc-ter and wrung out well. The milk should be drawn out as soon as possible, either by the child or a breast pump. Of the latter, we have found those having an Indian rubber globe attached to them, to be the best kind. DETERIORATION OF MIILK. A good quality of human milk should exhibit a whitish color, with a tinge of bluish or yelloiwish; should taste [Page 502](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/504) i- 502 DISEASES OF FE-MALES. pleasantly sweet and have no smell; a drop of it put on a nail should glide off from the same, if held in an oblique position, slowly, leaving a whitish mark on the nail. A drop of good human milk put in a tumbler of water, will mix in it slowly, forming clouds in it here and there. Sometimes the milk deteriorates, becomes too thin and watery, or too thick, oleaginous, acrid, even acid; at other times it appears mixed with pus and blood, tastes bitter and assumes an abnormal color. Milk can, however, be deteriorated without exhibiting any other external signs, save its bad consequences on the child. This is particularly the case after severe mental emotions, fear, grief, anger, etc., or the use of large doses of medicines, which, absorbed by the vessels, come into the circulation of the system. As to the effect of the mind on the secretion of milk, Carpenter remarks: \"The formation of this secretion is influenced by the nervous system to a greater degree, perhaps, than that of any other. The process may go on continuously. to a slight degrcee during the whole period of lactation; but it is only in animals that have special reservoirs for that purpose, that any accumulation of the fluid can take place. In the human fcmal.', these reservoirs are so small as to hold but a trifling quantity of milk; and the greater part of the secretion is actually forintd while the child is at the breast. The irritation of the nipple produced by the act of suction, and the mental emotion connected with it, concur to produce an increased flow of blood into the gland, which is known to nurses as the cdr1aughti; and thus the secretion is for the time greatly augmented. Trhe draught may be produced simply by the emotional state of the mind, as by the thought of the child when absent; and the irritation of the nipple may alone occasion it; but tIhe two influences usually act simultaneously. The most remnarkable examples of the influence of such stimuli on the inamma;Ly secretion, are those in which milk has been produced by girls [Page 503](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/505) DETERIORATION OF MIILK. 503 and old women, and even by men, in quantity sufficient to support an infant. The application of the child to the nipple in order tranquilize it, the irritation produced by its efforts at suction, and the strong desire to furnish milk, seem, in the first instance, to occasion an augmented nutrition of the gland, so that it becomes fit for the performance of its function; and then to produce in it that state of functional activity, the result of which is the production of milk. It is not only in this way that the mammary secretion is influenced by the condition of the mind; for it is particularly liable to be affected as to quality by the habitual state of the feelings, or even by their temporary excitement. Thus, a fretful temper not only lessens the quantity of milk, but makes it thin, serous, and gives it an irritating quality; and the sime effect will be produced for a time by a fit of anger. Under the influence of grief or anxiety, the secretion is either checked altogether, or it is diminished in amount and deteriorated in quality. The secretion is usually checked altogether by terror; and under the influence of violent passion it may be so changed in its character, as to produce the most injurious, and even fatal consequences to the infant. So many instances are now on record in which children that have been suckled within a few minutes after the mothers have been in a state of violent rage or terror, have died suddenly in convulsive attacks, that the occurrence can scarcely be set down as a mere coincidence; and certain as we are of the deleterious effects of less severe emotions upon the properties of the milk, it does not seem unlikely that in these cases, the bland nutritious fluid should be converted into a poison of rapid and deadly operation.\" There is evident danger in allowing the child to suck immediately after violent emotions of the mind; the same has been experienced after violent bodily exercise. running or performing hard manual labor. A suitable L]ngth of time should elapse before a mother dare give, wit;h itnpunity, the breast to a child after such disturbing influences have occurred, and not [Page 504](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/506) 5o 04 DISEASES OF FESIALES. even then should the child suck until after a conside able quantity of milk has been extracted artificially, else it will become sick from the milk which was in the breast during the excitement. The quality of the milk can be improved by the use of the following remedies. If it is thin and serous take China, every other evening a dose (six glob.), for eight days; if not improved at that time, take Stanult in the same manner, and if not better after its use, take JMil.ciy, particularly if the infant refuses to suck. If the color of the milk is too yellow and the taste a bitter one, give Rhemn in the same manner. If the child throws up the milk immediately after sucking, give Silicea every three or four days one globule, until better. SUPPRESSED SECRETION OF M-ILK. The circumstances which suppress the secretion of milk in the breasts, are as various as the manifold relations, external or internal, which influence our system. The most prominent, however, are the following: Exposures to cold or dampness, errors in diet, sudden and violent mental emotions, diseases in other parts of the system, particularly if they are of a nervous character. The consequences following a sudden suppression of lacteal secretion, are frequently of a serious nature, and their pievention requires our immediate attention. The danger is greatest when congestions to the head, breast or abdomen appear. Give immediately of Pulsatilla (twelve globules dissolved in half a teacupful of water), every two or three hours a teaspoonful;. this will frequently restore the flow of milk, particularly if cold was the cause. B3ut should congestions of the head, lungs or abdomen be present, give [Page 505](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/507) EXCESSIVE SECRETION OF MiILK. 0 5: Beladonna and Bryonila in the same manner as above, in alternation, until bette'. If miei!al Cemotions have caused it and the patient is very muach excited and restless, give first Aconite and Coffca in altcrna~tion, as above. If cexposure to cold or damnpness produced the suppression give C/am;omile, BRyonic, and Rhus, particularly when the head and limbs ache and fever is present, having been preceded by a chill. If d(;rr1hea sets in, give Pulsatilla, Metcury, Bryonifa, Rhcs. E]XcEss IYE SECRETION OF MILK. A too copious secretion of milk may produce swelling and inflammation of the breasts with all its concomitants; also obstructed or involuntary emission of milk, debility, nervous and inflammatory disorders, headache, hysterics, even tubercular consumption. In such cases medical aid should be sought at once. Until that is procured, the following remedies may be given. Belladonca every other evening a dose (six glob.), will diminish the secretion, if febrile and congestive symptoms are present. Calcaarea carb., if the former does not give relief, in the same manner for one week. If not relieved, take PhosPhorus in the same manner; beside apply externally cotton batting, which mitigates swelling and pains. The same remedies are beneficial, if the milk escapes all the time, keeping the parts constantly wet and rendering them more liable than usual to cold on the slightest exposure. C/'i)u should be given when great debility is present, either when the milk flows involuntarily or is secreted too copiously; in the former case it alternates well with Pttlsatilla, in the latter with Rhis, every evening a dose (four glob.), until better. Frequent washing and bathing is recommended.. 3 [Page 506](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/508) EiOG(i DISEASES OF FEMIALES. _DEFICIENCY OF MIILK. Various circumstances may cause a deficiency of milk in quantity; they are either constitutional or occasional. To the former belongs the mother's age, which if too young or too far advanc-ed predisposes to this complaint; women inclined to corpulcney have not much milk, also such as in former confinements, compelled by disease or otherwise, lid inot inurse their children; organic diseases of the bceasts thlemselves mnly sometimes prevent the secretion of a suffiient quantity of milk. As exciting causes may be accounted depressing mental emotions, sudden change of the mother's mole of living, sedecnttl,' habit, exposure to cold and dampness, faults in the diet. abuse of cathartic medicine and a high degree of physical debility. As to the treatment of this disease we have, of course, first to remove its cause, as far, at least, as possible. After this is done the following remedies should be given to correct the remalinig derangement. Agnets cas!us is recommended very highly in cases of this kind; the patient takes every other evening a dose (six glob). If constitutional causes operate, the patient should undergo a proper treatment by a competent Homoeopathic physician. Calcarea, fodium, Cazusticurnm, Sepia, and Szlphur, in such cases will be most beneficial. Asafoetida in small quantities, either in tincture or first trituration, is recommended very highly; as also the anis and dill seed; the latter made into a tea and drank three or four times a day. Some women use drinks made of milk and various spirituous liquors: we would request the reader to be careful in their use, as the child will thus receive milk more or less impregnated with alcohol and its fearful consequences. SoRE NIPPLES. This affection, consisting of an excoriation of the skin around and on the nipple, usually appears soon after the child has [Page 507](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/509) AGUE IN THE BREAST-GATHERED;BR.EAST. 507 been put to the breast. Its main cause consists in a constitutional tenderness of the skin, which manifests itself on the slightest occasion, in cracks and wounds, of a very sensitive nature. We have witnessed distressing cases of this kind; the sufferings seem sometimes to be insupportable, if the complaint has progressed very far. Our aim from the beginning should be to prevent the soreness of the nipples, by washing them and the breasts a few months before parturition twice a day in cold water. This strengthens the skin and renders it less liable to he affected afterward. After the birth of the child observe the following directions. Apply Av.irca, six drops of the tincture to a teacupful of water; wash with it every time after the child has sucked. At the same time give internally. (athamomile every four or six hours a dose (four glob.), particularly when the nipples inflame, swell and threaten to ulcerate, with pains almost insupportable, like tooth-ache. If this fails give the following medicines in their order, each one ounce a day for six or eight days until relief is obtained. Mllrcury, Sulphur, Silicea, Graphites, Lycopodiumn, Calcarca carb. These remedies are intended to remove the constitutional taint which underlies the affection, and without the extinction of which no true cure of sore nipples can be effected. One of the best expedients externally applied, is a cow's teat fastened on a silver plate; this instrument can be had in the drug stores. They are preserved in diluted alcohol and arc washed in clean water each time before being applied. If the wound is not ulcerated, it may be covered with collodion. which permits the sucking of the child without tearing it open every time afresh. AGTE IN THE BREAST. GATHERED BREAST. It is a general law of our nature, that organs which are at certain periods especially active, are at that time more subject to disease than others not equally active. During lactation, [Page 508](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/510) 508 DISEASES OF FEMALES. the breasts are the organs predominantly active in the female system; they are, therefore, the ones on which the diseases occurring during the whole of that period will reflect more or less. If a nursing woman gets cold, it will settle there; if by mental excitement, passion, fright, anger, fear, grief, etc., she becomes sick, it will affect first the secretion of milk; in short, any disorder during lactation has its bad effect on this process. Ague in the breast is the most common form by which this effect manifests itself, and if not relieved at once, will end in the suppuration of the mammary gland. A more or less severe chill is followed by fever, generally accompanied by lancinating or shooting pains in the breast, whose secretion is mostly arrested at the time. This increases the size of the breast and if the milk is not removed, will predispose to inflammation and suppuration. As a general rule we recommend to give at once, Charmomile and Bryonia alternately, every hour a dose (four glob.), for four hours; after which discontinue for four hours, and let the fever pass off by perspiration, without giving any more medicine; if the fever, however will not disappear, or if it returns, give Acoltite and Belladonna, particularly when the breasts are swollen, hard, and very tender; externally, apply hot brandy cloths. If lumps remain in the breasts, rub with sweet oil, or lay over the breast a plaster made of beeswax and sweet oil. If a gatlhering of the breast can not be avoided, abstain from applying the warm poultices as long as possible, as it has a tendency to implicate a still larger part of the breast within the suppurative sphere; give during this time'Phosphljorus and lepar alternately, morning and evening a dose (four glob.), until better, or until four doses of each are taken, after which discontinue the medicine, awaiting its effects at least three or four days; if no signs of improvement are visible, give.erclury and Lachesis in the same manner; and then again, [Page 509](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/511) STATE OF TIHE BOWELS DURING CONFIN-EMENT. 509 Phosphorus and i-Hepnar, until the abscess has opened or the swelling is diminished. After the opening of the abscess and the discharge of the matter, give Silicca, every evening and morning a dose (four glob.); externally apply a wash on the breast three times a day, mn:lde of twelve globules of SiNicea in half a teacupful of water. This remedy may be followed in two weeks, if necessary, by Sulphur, internally in the same manner as Siliceat, and thus in alternation with it, until the breasts are healed. During this time poultices of bread and milk, or slippery elm, m}ay be used to mitigate the irritation. Let tihe diet be nourishing but not stimulating. The infant may be allowed to nurse as long as possible; and if not, use the breast-pump to draw the milk out as often as needed. STATE OF THE BOWELS DURING CONFINEMENT. On account of the great changes going on at this time in the female organism, whereby a great quantity of liquids is disclharged from the womb and breasts, their secretion in the intestines and discharge by the stool is retarded, mostly for five days after delivery; if a stool is forced, artificially, before that time, it must operate injuriously, as that much liquid is taken away from places where nature needed it most. If after the lapse of five days, no motion on the bowels has appeared, give of Bryonia, four doses, every three hours one (six glob.), and await its effects twenty-four hours, after which, give Nux vomica in the same manner, if necessary. Suclphur after that, if necessary, in the same manner. An injection, either of lukewarm water and two tablespoonfuls of sweet oil, or the same with a little castile-soap dissolved in it, may be given on the sixth day, if necessary, and as often afterward as needed. If diarrhea sets in the principal medicines are: Rheum, Phosphoric acid, China, tPulsatilla. FCo'r closer examination [Page 510](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/512) 510 DISEASES OF FEM3ALES. of the symptoms and their exciting cause, see article \"Diarrhea.\" But there is one kind of diarrhea peculiar to nursing women, which is frequently connected with the nurshilg solre oou1th (see this below). The discharges from the bowels are whitish, curdled, smelling sour and musty, being copious and frequent, but not very painful. This diarrhea is the beginning of consumption of the bowels, and must be attended to immediately. I have found the following remedies almost specife in such cases: Nux vonEica and ]Iepar, alternately, every three hours a dose (six glob.), until better, or until six doses of each are taken; at the same time the patient must lie on the bed or couch. DIET.-Black tea, dry toast, rice, afterward, beef-steak and roasted mutton. (See, beside, \"Consumption of the Bowels.\") CHILDBED FEVER. There are few diseases more dangerous than this, particularly when it has been permitted by neglect or otherwise, to progress in its fearful career. Consequently, by introducing it here we can not have the intention of enabling the reader to treat it, when fully developed; this stage requires the most skillful medical aid. Our aim is to make the reader acquainted with its character and symptoms, and such remedial means as will have a tendency to subdue it in the beginning, which can be effected more easily than its cure in after stages. D)iagnosis. \u2014Like most fevers, childbed fever is preceded by a chill, or at least a chilly sensation, crawling from the small of the back along the spine upward; it is generally not very severe, even less so than those rigors indicating the approach of a milk fever, with which it might be confounded. But its apparent mildness and the presence of tenderness to the touch of the abdomen across the uterine region, which is wanting in milk fever, establish the diagnosis of approaching childbed fever. It is important to remember that tenderness of the [Page 511](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/513) CITILDBED F'VEV1ER. 511 ahdomen is always connected with puerperal fever, even with the chi'l which precedes it. The slightest touch of the finger, iay, the wcight of the bed-clothes on the abdomen, is almost ir:su io;tbL}:).le, the pains are sometimes so intense, that the ptilents cry out loudly and scream with agony. The mildest c~ii!.l~ ibe followed by the severest fever. The whole abdomien -e atsis to be inflamed in a very short time; the loclia are |sppr!essed. so is also the secretion of milk, if it already had aiTe. rcd'; if not, it will of course, not make its appearance in tlhat cin:lition of the patient. Sometimes the childbed fever attacls shortly after delivery, within two or three days; at other tiimes it appears only after ten or twelve days. The latter cases are considered more favorable than the former. If the pain is confined to one particular spot in the abdonmen, the dis ase is not so dangerous as if the whole abdomen is painful to the touch. This latter is the most characteristic symptom of this fever; while other fevers may resemble it, having simi1-r pains, none has this extreme tenderness to the touch, even to the slightlest pressure on the abdomen. The pulse is always very frequent, as high as 150 per minute; excessive thirst, headache, burning fever, vomiting, etc., are present in nmost cases. A Without detaining the reader with a greater amount of detail on a disease, which, in its hight, none but a professional man will allow hiimself to treat, we will indicate at once what has to be done in the beginning. r,tmer'7l.-Dluring the chill give the patient of Aconibte (twelve glob., dissolved in half a teacupful of water), everyc tialf hour a teaspoonful, until it is succeeded by fever, when it is alternated with BcUl/tudonna, prepared in a similar manner, every hour or two hou's a teaspoonful, until better. If the lochia have ceased, alternate Br-7/yoI, prepared simnilarly as A-,milf. lntil the severest symptoms cease. At the same tinle put around the abdomen a thick cold-water b:mndzlge, frequently renewed, until the heat disappears, and profuse [Page 512](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/514) 51 2 DISEASES OF FEMALES. perspiration, rest, quiet, and sleep ensue. Give as a drink plenty of cold water; fresh air is also necessary. ]MILK-LEG. (Phlegmasia Albact Doi,ni.)! We make mention of this disease here, as oule wh:,ls- symptoms and course are so strange and frightful to tie urii tia ted, that a better acquaintance with its character is veiv dCe-siratble. its treatment, when fully developed, must ae dict-et(d by a skillful physician; only in the beginning. re medies; i xv be alt once applied to subdue it; these we intend to con.nuvmnicate. i Diaygosis.-The first symptoms of this disease are pain and swelling in some part of the leg or groin, -hich soon ilr.e. se and prevent the motion of the limb at a very carly stage. the fever present is generally not very high, but very colnsttatnt. The disease makes its appearance usually within the first two weeks after delivery, and consists in an inflaimmation of the lymphatic vessels, veins and areolar tissue o;f the leg; the vulgar belief, that the milk, transferred fiom the breasts by some cause, appears in the legs, and makes them swell, is, of course, at the present day discarded as unfounded, and nothing is left of this belief but the popular name, milk-ley. It is astonrishing to what an extent the leg can swell up in this disease it being sometimes larger than a man's body. Treatzemat.-Bellado}-inm.a seems to be the remedlv which, in the beginning, better than any other controls this di;sease. Give three tinmes a day a dose (six glob.), followed by Bryoeia and lRhus in alternation, in the same manner, if necessary. As soon as possible procure medical aid; meanwhile keep the leg at rest and in an elevated position. The diet during this i time must be very light, such as tea. toast and gruels; i' a. relish~ is wanted, lemonades, stewed prunes or other dried fruits are preferable. MANIMA IN CHILT BED. The above name indicates the nature of the discnse sufficiently; it is a mental derangement, caused by a peculiar condci [Page 513](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/515) NURSING. 513 tion in which the womb is during parturition and childbed. Althoulhg cases of this kind are rare, yet they occur; and if not lknown, mirht greatly frighten the attendants of the p:1 ti<nt,:.

They may be given, the first two in alternation, morning, noon and night a dose (four glob ); the latter twice a day a dose (six glob.), if the former did not relieve. As this disease, on account of its importance, requires the most skillful medical aid, we abstain from giving here more of its treatment. If the secretions peculiar to childbed, such as milk and lochia, re-appear, a, favorahble issue of the disease miay be expected. NuTrrsING. With the termIination of parturition the object of nature is only half fulfilled. T'he new being has been brou(ght into the world; but torn from its parental roots, it would have gained nothing. if natuire had not kindly provided the fountain of life, from which, for some time to come, it is destined to draw its nourishment, suitable in an eminent degree for its infantile nature. Withoult this brc, ast of milk, the helpless you-ng would [Page 514](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/516) | 1i ~: DISEASES OF FEMIALES. perish by the hundred; and though large, deplorably larg., as it at present is, still the mortality of infants would be frightful, nay. equal to a complete destruction of the human race, if nature had not mixed and prepared the food in the mother's bosom for the feeble offspring. A. provision of this kind demands our unqualified admiration and most loyal adhesion; although a law of nature in the fullest sense of the word, it does not manifest itself in passionate excistement for self-gratification, or vigorous egotism for sel~preservation, which constitute the stimuli of imost other laws of nature; but in the more divine garb of love, not in receiving biit in dispensing blessings; not in defending one's self, but in protecting another one from starvation and death by offering for sustenance the E;fe's fluid of one's self. Fl'o' this purpose nature provided the milk-secreting organs whose function must be exercised, else injury will be done not only to the infants, by depriving them of their natural nrourishment, but also to the health of the mother, by the distension and inflammation of the breasts. Reasons of the most url-ent nature should only prevent a mother from sucklinmg her infant. Serious diseases, such as consumption, eruptive or other fevers, great constitutional debility, mental derangement, etc., are some of those which demand a discontinuance of nursing. But they occur very rarely; more friequently do we meet with,a spirit of unwillingness on the part of mothers, to underC,,o tle trouble, and occasional self-denial, which the nurlsing of infants forces upon them. In a majority of such cases. it is not want of maternal affection, but the belief that their own'i health and beauty mighlt suffer, while no (danmae could result, ffrom it to the health of the infant by taking the milk of another one. As to the first reason, mothers are sadly mistalcen. All medical men agree that nursing, far from deteriorating or wclakening the constitution, adds to the health and beauty of w, mel. Besides, it is a matter ef the greatest the most suitable nourishment; and none is more suitable than the own mother's milk. Neither in age or quality can it be rivaled by that of a wet-nurse, to say nothing of the many other disqualifying circumstances of the latter. WET-NURSE. If it is, however, indispensable in some cases to have a wetnurse, great care should be taken of ascertaining that she possesses the requisite qualifications. We would recommend that she should be examined thoroughly by the physician of the family, before she is permitted to give her breast to the child. She must be free from diseases of the skin, eyes and eyelids; she ought to have a clear complexion and healthy, full form. Her disposition should be mild and amiable; her character energetic, but not irritable. She must show a habit of cleanliness in personal matters; regularity and temperance in eating an(i drinking. Her Inorals should be above suspicion. If these qualities have been found in a nurse, it is necessary to compare the age of her milk with that which the child needs; it dare not vary three months either way. In all other respects, if she is engaged, she should live and act during nursing as the mother herself would do. It is well, however, to watch a nurse carefully for a month or two, before too much confidence is bestowed upon her, as she may slily do things not exactly wrong in her own opinion, yet objectionable altogether. Some nurses are in the habit of giving the children laudanum, to make them sleep well as they say. This, of course, has to be interdicted at once, for obvious reasons. Opium in any shape or form should be withheld from an infantile constitution; it is more dangerous and destructive than alcohol. If the mother concludes to nurse the infant herself, it should be placed on the breasts eight or ten hours after delivery, except urgent circumst:ances prevent it. In doing( so, the niipples are at once drawn out and the act of suckling will encourage the flow of milk in the breasts, thereby preventing distension, as [Page 516](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/518) 516 DISEASES OF FEMALES. the milk already in the breasts being drawn out thus early, permits the newly secreted to take its place. e13sides, the infant once having taken hold of the nipple while not yet marde smaller by the distension of the breast, hardly ever refuscs to do so afterward, although the breast may be fall and tense and the nipple almost disappear. It is a very reprehensible practice in mothers, to give the breast to children on the slightest occasion; for instance, when it awales or begins to cry, either fr'om being frightened. as children often are, or from real pain. An infalt quieted hy the breast, will soon go to sleep, durincg which a congestive state of the brain is produced, sometimes to such an extent as to engender spasms. It is much better to calm down the irritability of a child by more rational mean.s; if nothing will help, a warm bath or some of the medicines recommended in the treatment of children, will do it, COffc, CJhamonmie and BclaclCdonna are the principal remedies for that purpose. WEANING. It is a question yet open for discussion, to determine when nursing shall cease. The opinions of medical writers are very much divided on this subject. Our own coincides with those who believe that it should not last longer than a year. certainly not over eighteen months. Others maintain that two and even three years is a~ time not too long. We hold that nature has indicated in the development of the child, her own wish as to the proper period of the termination of nursing. As soon as thle teeth have appeared, the chil(d is evidently ready to masticate and digest substances more solid than milk, and the elgernciss with w-hich it seeks to get lhold of more solid fo.ld at that time, proves clearly that nature designed to terminate nursing. It is proper, however, to continue until the period of teething is fair'ly over, as this is a time during which the celill(Ienl are more or less delicate ancd feebl;e. [Page 517](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/519) DIET-SORE MOUTH. 517 DIET DURING NURSING. The diet of the mother, while nursing, should be more nourishing than common, although it is not necessary to be too particular in its selection. Her own wishes will generally point to the kind of food most wholesome for herself and child. As regards the latter, a little experience will soon teach the proper medium, and this must be kept. Acid food or drink, though perfectly agreeable to the mother, usually disagrees with the infant; consequently the mother will have to abstain from it. We have mostly found it the best plan to let nursing mothers prescribe their own diet, choosing it according to their liking; as to quantity we would advise them not to indulge their appetite too much at a time. To eat frequently but little at once, should be the rule. A so-called stimulating diet is under no circumstances advisable. Either the nursing mother is well, then she has no need of stimulating food or drink; or she is sick, then she needs medical treatment, which, according to Homeoopathic principles, is always without stimulus. We will now consider the various disorders belonging to the nursing period. SORE MIOUTH OF NURSING WOMEN. In some females this complaint is constitutional; it is caused by the peculiar irritation which nursing has upon their digestive organs; if let alone, it sometimes becomes so bad as to force us to discontinue nursing, or to send the patient to mountainous places (the higher the better), where the digestive organs become stronger and more able to resist this weakening influence, occasioned by the constant loss of fluid (milk). rthe following remedies, however, will be used with benefit: Mercury, China, in alternation, every evening and morning a dose (four glob.), for a week. Nitric acid, every other evening a dose (four glob.), until better, or for a week; and, afterward. [Page 518](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/520) 518 18DISEASES OF FEMALES. Borax, Nex vowe., Sulphtur, in the same manner. Beside, see article on \" Stomacace.\" DIET AND REGIMEN.-Diet nutritious, but not flatulent, as frequently a diarrhea accompanies this complaint, which requires particular attention. See foregoing article. Exercise in the cool, fresh air (but not fatiguing exertion by walking), riding out in a carriage, etc., are beneficial, also cold bathing, or sponging. GENERAL COMPLAINTS DURING CONFINEMENT. For sleeplessness: Rhus, Lachesis, Arsenic, Sulphur. N. B. For further information and the administration of medicines in the above diseases, see their respective Chapters. IRRITABLE UTERUS. Rhelumatism and Neuralgia of the Womb. We have had occasion to speak of these complaints in connection with after-pains and other disorders of the lying-in. But they frequently appear idiopathic without being caused by, or complicated with any other disease. The most charac.teristic symptom of all of them is a pain, the seat and direction of which varies as it now proceeds from the small of the back and the lumbar region, now starts from the front part of the pelvis and radiates in all directions. The fact of the pains being increased by motion, erect position, and its abatement by a recumbent one, has given rise [Page 519](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/521) IRRITABLE UTERUTS. 519 to an erroneous diagnosis, by mistaking this disease for falling of the womb. Yet a careful examination per vagrinam, will convince us tlhat, though the uterus is found to be lower in the vagina than common, it is not prolapsed or otherwise seriously displaced; but its neck is very sensible to the touch, somewhat shortened, because enlarged, and the mouth of the uterus more closed than in a natural state: the vagina itself feels hot taid swollen.'lhe course of this disease is more chronic than acute, and involves more or less all the uterine functions. It appeallrs mostly in paroxysms, brought on by certain exciting causes, such as erect position, over-exertion, conjugal connections, powerful mental emotions, even faults in diet; sometimes themlost extreme point of the spine becomes so tender as to prevent the patients from sitting any length of time. lThe treatment of these disorders should be conductecd by a skillful physicia;n. Before his attendance, an effort may be made to diminish the congestive tendency to the neck of the womb by giving Belladonna and Sepia alternately, every four days a dose (six glob.), until better, in connection with tepid injections in the vagina, and tepid sitz-baths. During this time the patient should abstain from meat and other stimulating diet, keeping as quiet as possible. [Page 520](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/522) -CHAPTER X Vi. TREATMENT OF CItILDREN. APPARENT DEATH OF A NEW-BORN INFANT. (Aspl yxia.) If the new-born infant, as yet in connection with the afterbirth, either from exhaustion or other causes does not breathe, or at least very imperfectly, it requires immediate attention. Its mouth must be cleaned from the mucus within, and its limbs and the navel-string freed from all incumbrances. While one attendant procures warm water for a bath, another may improve the time by rubbing its spine, particularly that portion behind the upper part of the lungs from the neck downward, vigorously, and for a long time. This movement alone, is in most cases sufficient to restore animation and compel the infant to breathe. If no sign of life appears after fifteen minutes, put the infant, without cutting as yet the navel-string, into a warm bath, in which the rubbing on the spine and elsewhere should be continued. If this manipulation is unsuccessful, inflate the infant's lungs by breathing gently into its mouth, for which purpose it should be covered with a loose silk handkerchief, in order to break the force of the inflation. When the lungs are inflated, press the breast outside to expel the air again, and thus continue to inflate the lungs and expel the air in alterna.tion for some time. If the child looks pale in the face, give it a dose (two glob.) of tartar emetic; if it looks bloated, almost crimson, give it Opium (two glob.) on the tongue. If no signs L. (5...20) DIEE T OF NEW-BORN after that, cut the navel string if no pulsation is any more percptib!le in it (as long as the navel-string pulsates it shlould never be cut), remove the child fiom the bath, dry I;ff and wrap it well in warm flannels. After it has been allowed some rest, the efforts of re-animation should begin again in the same manner; in addition to the above, slight shocks of electricity row should be applied, directing the poles onl the upper part of the spine and in front on the breast-bone. DIET OF A NEW-BORN INFANT. After washing and dressing, the infant wants sleep, into which it falls as soon as it is warm enough. Put it in the mother's bed; near her, if possible. After having slept for six or eight hours, lay it on the breast, even if no milk were there, and feed it afterward with molasses and water (under no circumstances bread and water), or milk and water, half and half, and sweetened with loaf sugar. it is scarcely possible to state precisely the time when and how often an infant should take the breast; we can only advise the reader to be as regular in this respect as possible. Infants can be trained into certain habits very early. If no sickness prevents, an infant should have the breast about every three hours during the daytime, while in the night it can do without the breast for six or eight hours. This habit once formed, will preserve its health better, on the known principle that regularity in eating and drinking does the same in adults. Wash its mouth after feeding every time with cold water; it prevents the thrash. COLIC. CRYING OF INFANTS. Examine well whether pins, sticking the little sufferer, are the cause. If no ca.use is apparent but the universal one (colic), give Chun,7-omfile and B3clltdoz7na, in alternation, everys half hour or hour a dose (one glob.), on the tongue. 4-4 [Page 522](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/524) 522 TREAT 3ENT OF CHILDREN. If the child bends its body double while crying, and retracts its thighs, give C hamowmile, when the face is red; or Belladonna, when the face is pale. If the child has greenish stools at the same time, give Chamomile. If it has loose evacuations, of a sour smell, give Rheum. If these will not suffice, _[piecac. and Jala})pa. All in the same manner. For great restlessness, sleeplessness, and feverish heat, with crying, give GcffeaCc. and Belladonnaco-, in the same manner. Sometimes a tepid bath relieves the infant's sufferings, when nothing else will do it, or the application of the wet sheet, to do which, the infant is simply wrapped in a wet napkin or towel and well covered. ELONGATION OF THE HEAD. This deformity of the infant's head is only temporary; wash it with AArnica tincture and water (six drops to a teacupful); in a few days it will disappear. SNUFFLES. OBSTRUCTION OF THE NOSE. (Coyza.) Give Naux vomica, one glob., in the evening, and Sambucus the next evening, if not better; in that manner alternate, until relieved. If the nose runs water, give Chcamonmile; and if this does not relieve, Calcarea, every other night one or two globules; Garbo veg., when it is worse, every evening, and Dulcamnara, when worse in the open air; Tartar emetic, when there is rattling of mucus in the chest, worse at night. SWELLING OF THE BREASTS OF INFANTS. Do not press or handle rudely these delicate swellings; as they contain nothing, the least of all milk, to be squeezed out. It is an inflammation, and must be treated like any other inflammation of glands. First, we should try to reduce the [Page 523](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/525) RESTIESSNESS \u2014INFLAM3M-AT'ION OiF EYES. 5 2 swelling; which can be accomplished, in most cases, by covering it with a lint, dipped in sweet oil. If this will not succeed. wash it several times with warm brandy and water, anld give the child internally, OChalmomile and Belladoona, alternately, every evening and morning a dose (one glob). If it still grows larger (I have seen them of the hight of one inch and more), keep on it a bread-and-milk poultice, and after the gathering opens, treat it like any other abscess; inwardly, give M1erc;y and Hejpar, every evening one glob., alternately. RESTLESSNESS. SLEEPLESSNESS. If without any apparent cause, the child can not sleep, give it Cogbcaco. and Belladonnacc, alternately, every hour one glob., which in most cases will have the desired effect. If not, however, give Chalmomile, if the restlessness is attended by flatulency and griping; the child starts and is feverish, with redness of ore cheek. Pulsatilla and ]oecacuanha, if it arises from overloaded stomach. Opiiumn, if the face of the child looks red and bloated. APPLICATION OF WATERt, see \"Colic of Infants,\" page 521. INFLAMMATION OF THE EYES. This is a frequent complaint among infants. Do not expose the eyes to a light too strong, nor to cold draughts of air. Drop a few drops of the mother's milk into the eyes several times a day. Beside, give Aconite and Belladonna, in alternation, three times a day one glob., for several days. If this course does not succeed, give Chamnomile, when the eyelids are swollen and glued together in the morning with yellow matter. Mtrrc<ry and Pulsatilla, in alternation, if small, yellowish ulcers are perceived on the margins of the eyelids, with discharge of yellowish matter. [Page 524](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/526) 524 TREATMENT OF CHILDREN. if not better, give Ectphrasiat and Rhus, in the same manr:; nld, at last, S1lphur, every other evening one glob., a NV eei, p:;l ticularly in scrofulous children. TIRusHi, OR SORE MOUTH OF INFANTS. (Aphlthc.) This disease to which infants are most liable within the first or second month after birth, consists in the fornmation of whitish flake-like excrescences on the tongue and around the gunms. Before their appearance, the mouth and tongue seem to be unusually tender, as indicated by rose-colored patches on the surface of the tongue and around the gums, with unusual dryness and lack of moisture in the mouth; the child at the same time showing a reluctance in nursing, with a res:tless, crying mood. Soon the thrush begins to make its appearance in whitish spots on the tongue and gums, which multiplying and uniting, may cover the whole interior of the inoull as if sprinkled thickly with flour. If the thrush has reached this hight the general he:alth of the infant begins to suffer; diarrhea, followed by feverishness, sets in with their necessary consequences of emaciation and decline. CAUSES. It is generally believed that a want of cleanliness produces this disease in infants; yet such is not always the case, although it frequently may generate it, or contribute at least to its progress and fatality. We must acknowledge a constitutional taint in the system, as one of the principal causes of this disease, as we find it occurring so often in private families, where the most scrupulous care in regard to cleanliness was taken to prevent its attacks. I have observed, also, that the season has influence upon its frequency; a moist heat of the summer months predisposing to its appearance, amounting sometimes even to an epidemic. A frequent cause of this disease, is those little bags, filled with sugar and bread, which are put into the infant's mouth for sucking, to keep it from crying; they irritate the tender [Page 525](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/527) THR-USH, OR SORE MOUTH OF INFANTS. 525 mnelmluane of the mtouth, whilh irritation defgenerates into real soon as the stomach-juice altrrs, and deteriorates; nalod this, it always does, by dosing the child's stomach with sugLr and bread, a combination of substances which must iro!uce acidity. Another cause of the thrush is, the improper use of the bottle or Fpoon, if children are principally nursed by them. The grcatest cleanliness is, in such cases, indispensable, in order to pI-'vent thrush; the milk in the bottle must never be allowed it soia, it must always be prepared fiesh for the use of the in fant; the best proportions in mixing it with water, is half and hidf; yet, sometimes I have found the clear milk not too stron-:g for very young infants, in cases where diluted milk seemed not to nourish them sufficiently. The cow's milk is clleerallv not richer thatn the mother's, and whv shall we not gvie it in the same degree of nourishiang in which nature designed it originally to be given. The tatutre of the thrush is as yet little known; on the first sight, the mnouth has the appearance of being ulcerated, which, in reality, it is not; underneath the white flake, the mucous membrane appears unaltered, except having a reddish tilt. Mlicuroscopic investigations have led the p.hybsicians to believe thrush to be rather a fung'rid excrescence on the mucous membrane, which, like a paLrasite, developing itself fioom irntrnal causes, grows on that particular spot, under circumnstances favorable to its development. Certain it is that the thrush never appears on the mucous membrane of the nose or windpipe, but exclusively on that of the mouth and stomach-pipe, showing thereby a specific relation to the abdominal system. Whatever its nature may be, its treatment is sufficiently known to us, anld we can, in almost all cases, prevent or remove it entirely and safely. The thrush is to a certain extent contagious. a circumstance which has been verified in numerons cases. Its contagion can be propagated by allowing other children to nurse from the [Page 526](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/528) 55 2 6 TREATMENT OF CHILDREN. same breast, or use the same bottle or spoon, nay, the dried flakes out of the mouth of the sick infant, inhaled by healthy iufanlts, have produced thrush. the sipples of the nurse or mother also feel the bad influence of the thrush, by becoming teilder and irritated, which can increase to a great extent, and is prevented only by washing the nipples, immediately after nursing, with cold water. Tn'RE;ATrJENT. In the beginning, when the child appears restless and fretful, as if unwilling to nurse or to take the bottle, give Coi.ca and Cmhamomnkc, particularly when the mouth is dry, hot, and of uncommonly reddish hue. These remedies nay be given in alternation every morning, noon and night, two globules at a dose, until amelioration takes place. If thie real thrush, however, appears, rub the spots off iummediately with a solution of borax in water or honey; after this application, cleanse the mouth well with a rag dipped in clear cold water, in order that no borax may remain in the mouth for a longer time than is necessary to remove the thrush. Because the borax is the Homooeopathic remedy for thrush, it can, therefore, create it, if used in excess. If the latter has been done, as is often the case, where nurses or mothers are inexperienced, the use of the borax has to be discontinued, and its antidotes must be administered. These are C/?f0amon~is and Co:cca, which, in such cases, given as above stated, will, within a few days, remove all traces of thrush from the tonogue and gums. In such a case, mothers must not be too anxious to see the thrush leave the tongue and gums at once; this would be impossible, beside not desirable, as the healing of the injured surface requires time; frequent washing with cold water will accelerate this process. If constipation should accrue during the convalescence, give Opium and Nlux vol?. in alternate doses of three globules each, three times a day, followed by a dose of Sulphur the next evening.

This is an eruption of red pimples on the face, neck and arms, sometimes over the whole body, caused mostly by keeping the child too warm. In most cases, this eruption disappears quickly, without medicine, if the child is not kept too warm, and bathed regularly. If the child is restless, give Chamomile, Aconite, Bellad., Rhus, Arsenic, Sulphur, every evening one glob., and every day another remedy, until relieved. tEXCORIATIONS. RAWNESS OF THE SKIN.

In such cases give Chamomile and Mercury, in alternation, every evening one glob., until better, if there is diarrhea. Nux vomica. In the same manner, if the child is restless and costive. Hepar.

ERYSIPELAS. (See,\"Erysipelas,\" under \"Diseases of the Skin.\") This disease claims the attention of a homoeopatl-lic physician. Yet the following remedies may be given, until one can be procured:.Belladonna and Aconite, alternately, every three or four hours one glob.; after the fever has subsided, ]Bclladon&a and Rhuts, in the same manner. The parts affected must be kept dry by dressing them with lint. CONVULSIONS, SPASMS OR FITS, Convulsions, commonly called fits, are a disease more dreaded than any other by mothers and nurses, because the external appearance of the little patient in such a state is indicative of great internal suffering, and revolting to the beholder, particularly to the feeling and sympathizing; another cause of the dread, with which a convulsion-fit is regarded, consists in its sudden and unexpected appearance, calling for its immediate and sufficient means of relief. All these considerations, if together, make it necessary for every physician to instruct parents and nurses especially on this subject, in order to remove fear as well as danger. If the fear is lessened, the mind of the parent is rendered more able to collect its means to combat the attack and lessen its danger. In no disease is a calmi and systematic order of medical proceeding more needed, than in a sudden fit of convulsion. 5We will first mention here the fact, that not all convulsions are dangerous in their character \u2014some, it is true, are very much so, and even fatal; but in that case they are rather the result than the cause of otherwise fatal diseases, for instance, convulsions after dropsy of the brain has set in, or those oc-uriring after severe falls or bruises on the head, in general all convulsions, appearing after long-continued acute brain or [Page 529](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/531) CONVULSIONS, SPASMS OR FITS. 629 bowel diseases. These are to be feared decidedly, and their generally fatal issue has allowed the popular mind to attach not unfiequently the same character to all convulsions indiscriminla tely. This is an error, and ought to be corrected. The brain of an infant is yet very tender, and can not resist any congestion toward it with the same impunity as that of an adult is able to do. The consequence is, that a child during many of its early diseases becomes liable to fits or convulsions, which have their origin in a congestion of the blood to the brain, from the nature of the disease present. To this class belong those from teething, anger, excessive crying and pains, such as ear-ache, etc. In these cases the convulsion-fit acts rather more beneficially than otherwise, as it generally terminates the bight of congestion by rendering the little patient insensible to former distresses, and thereby lessening the congestive tendency, the cause of the whole; a sound, refreshing sleep is generally the consequence of such a fit, as the result of the restored equilibrium between the nervous and vascular systems. How needless, therefore, in such cases, is an excessive fear on the side of parents and nurses. Yet we will not make it appear with this expression as if nothing must be done for the little sufferer. Our object is to calm and quiet the minds of the attendants in order to render their help more efficient. Another class of convulsions during infancy takes its origin from the nervous system alone, and acts in the same derivative manner as those caused by congestion, described above. We mention under this head the convulsions friom worms, and excessive joy and fear; after the attack, which generally lasts not very long, the little patient recovers quickly without his life having been endangered by it in the least. It is easily inferred from this, that an injudicious and heavy medication would in such cases be more injurious than beneficial, as with the quick disappearance of the convulsion., even all of its traces have vanished, but not those of a severe medication. A third class of convulsions, which have not to be dreaded 45 [Page 530](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/532) 530 TREATMIENT OF CHILDREN. so much, comprise those appearing at the beginning of eruptive diseases, such as scarlatina, measles, small-pox, etc.; if they only disappear quickly on the appearance of the eruption, which is generally the case. It is observed, that eruptive diseases, which commenced with spasms or convulsions (to all appearance aggravated cases), progressed and ended more favorably than those beginning light, and ended in a more mild form. It is, however, another thing, if the spasms appear during, or near the end of the eruptive disease, when they are symptoms indicating a most dangerous, and sometimes absolutely fatal state of the patient. Next in danger, are those convulsions caused by heavy falls or blows, as being generally the result of effusion of blood in the brain; these, however, not unfrequently terminate favorably, if the treatment for their cause is early and rightly commenced. Another and dangerous form of convulsions, is that resulting from an overloaded stomach, or after the child has eaten heavy, indigestible substances, such as nuts, apples, green fruit of any kind, etc. These are dangerous, because their presence depends upon such a material cause as to render them obstinate, and of longer duration; yet, even in such cases, a patient and persevering treatment, without hurry and confusion, leads to a favorable issue. This distinction between the different forms of convulsions is of the highest importance for the practical application of medicines, and shall guide us mainly while giving their tiredtment. GENERAL TREATMENT.-The importance of having remedies which will be suitable for all kinds of convulsions is evident, and their value is materially enhanced when they can be procured instantly, or are, at least. within the reach of every one. Order immediately a warm foot or general bath, if the size ~of the bathing-tub will allow of the latter. [Page 531](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/533) CONVULSIONS, SPASMS OR FITS. 531 While this is preparing, give the patient at once Belladonna, in almost all spasms the first remedy. Give, in preference, the Bcllat(7onnaco, in the following manner: put directly two glob, of it on the tongue of the child; then dissolve twelve glob. in four teaspoonfuls of water, mix well, and give every fifteen minutes a few drops on the tongue. After the bath (which may last from five to ten minutes), wrap the child, without drying off, in heated flannel, and lay it with its head higher on a pillow made of quilts, and, if possible, covered with oil-cloth. If only the foot-bath is applied, some mustard or ashes may be ruixed with the water; this must not be done, however, if the whole body of the patient shall be put into the bath. During the application of the foot-bath, cold water may be poured over the head of the patient in a small but constant stream, until the head feels quite cool. This process is repeated afterward as often as the head begins to feel warm again. If by this time the child has not yet recovered from the fit, order an injection to be made of lukewarm water; put into it a tablespoonful of sweet oil, and a little soap-suds (castile soap and water): apply as often as is necessary to produce an evacuation of the bowels; this is particularly indicated where the patient had been constipated or has had no action on the bowels for ten or twelve hours previous. All other means of a general import, such as rubbing with spirits of Hartshorn, Alcohol, or other stimulants, are objectionable; the opening of the clenched hands and thumbs is of no avail, and even injurious. The best position for the patient in this disease is either to lay on a wide bed, where he can not hurt himself during the involuntary motions of the muscles, or on the lap of the nurse or mother, with the head slightly elevated on the hand, or on a straw pillow. SPECIAL TREATMENT. -We now come to the selection of those remedies which suit the individual case, and are administered either immediately or during the time that the general [Page 532](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/534) 532 - TREATMENT OF CHILDREN. treatment is proceeding, which does not interfere with their action. Colnvulsions fiom teething occur frequently, particularly in very sensitive children, and are generally not dangerous, as the irritation and fever, which increased up to the time of their appearance, leaves quickly after the convulsion has terminated. It is beneficial. however, to give CoffeaCC' and Bclladclonacc in alternation every ten minutes, two globules; these are generally sufficient to allay an attack of this kind. Beside, Aconite, if the fever remains still very high, accompanied with much restlessness, crying and starting. Chamomile, if the muscles of the face and eyes twitch incessantly, the child moans, and has redness of one cheek with paleness of the other. The first symptom of the termination of any convulsion is the closing of the eyes, as a sign of returning quiet in the nervous system, and the commencement of a natural sleep, out of which the child awakens, mostly refreshed and convalescent. if this should not ensue, and instead of it a stupid, drowsy sleep, with frequent starting, sets in, the eyes only partially closed; give Bryonia and Hellebor, twelve glob. of each, dissolved in twelve teaspoonfuls of water, alternately every hour a teaspoonful, and treat afterward as for dropsy of the brain. (See page 536.) Convulsions from fr ight, require Opiumv, if the head seems very congested, child lies as if stunned, breathes heavily, as if snoring, with face dark, flushed, almost blue. Hyoscyamuts, if the child foams at the mouth, cries out wildly, makes attempts at rising, the facial muscles twitch, has involuntary discharges. Stramoniunm, if there is much trembling of the limbs, but no loss of consciousness. AcOt)ile and Coffa, if fright, fear or joy, has only agitated the nervous system to such a degree as to threaten the appearance of spasms. If worms are the cause of the convulsions, give OCinaacc, Hyos. [Page 533](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/535) M[ercury and Ignatia; the first and last particularly, when the Ascarides or Pin-worms cause the nervous agitation. If convulsions appear in the beginning of eruptive diseases, rashes, scarlatina, measles, small-pox, etc., give Coffeacc. and Aconict, to mitigate the nervous excitement, in intervals of fifteen minutes each, two globules; after that,.Bryonia and Belladonna, to prevent a return, by acting on the eruption specifically, which then soon will make its appearance. If a convulsion, however, appears during or near the end of an eruptive fever, it is a sign that the patient is in a very dangerous state-put him immediately in a warm bath, and pour, while in it, cold or ice water on his head, until consciousness returns. Internally, give Belladonna and Cup'rum in alternation, every half hour a dose (four globules), if not better in two hours, give in the same manner Stramonibum and Cupruniz, and lastly, Lachesis and Sulphur, in alternation as above. If an overloaded stomach is the cause of the convulsions, apply, immediately, hot water to the lower extremities, and cold water to the head, give internally as much lukewarm water as possible, to excite vomiting, and administer injections if the vomiting will not appear; beside give Veratrumn, if the child is pale and cold, with sweat on the forehead, no pulse; China, if red in the face, the temporal arteries throb violently; Ipecac. if there are efforts of vomiting. Patients of this kind must be covered well after they come out of the foot-bath, in order to excite the functions of the skin, particularly if no evacuation above or below takes place. Sometimes a cold on the lungs is suddenly translated to the heads of infants, causing violent convulsions, which are more obstinate than usual. In such cases, apply the external treatment, hot water to the feet and cold water to the head, constantly, even for hours, until the spasm leaves the brain and recedes to the lungs, where it excites difficulty of breathing, [Page 534](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/536) 534 TREATMENT OF CHILDREN. rattling, etc. The life of the patient can be saved by persevering and attending to the applications without ceasing. Internally, give Belladorna and Onprum; afterward, Opium and Cumphor, in alternation, until the catarrhal affection of the bronchia reappears. In one case of this kind, I once had to apply the cold water on the head for four consecutive hours, without intermission. I ceased with it as soon as the spasms descended into the lungs. It can not be recommended too strongly, to parents and nurses, to persevere in the appliance of the cold water in such cases; they must not relax their efforts until consciousness returns. TEETHING. (Dentition.) With seven months, the two middle teeth of the lower jaw appear; shortly after, the two corresponding ones in the upper jaw. From this time the little organism is constantly putting forth teeth, until, at the end of two or two and a half years, the first dentition, consisting of twenty teeth, is completed. The process of teething excites in the little ones a variety of diseases, which, if not well treated, too often prove fatal. The mother can do a great deal, in directing the mode of her living, in eating, drinking and acting, so as not to make her milk another source of suffering for the sickly sufferer. (See \"Hygiene.\") The gums swell and are painful; yet the child wants to bite and press something hard on the teeth, to relieve the intolerable itching and irritation underneath the gums. Give it an ivory ring. If fever appears, with restlessness, retching, etc., give o2ffeaCo. and Belladonnacc., alternately, every half hour or hour, half a teaspoonful (twelve glob. having been dissolved in half a teacupful of water). Chamomile and Belladonna, if convulsive jerkings or twitchings occur in the sleep. Cina, if with teething it has a dry, spasmodic cough, or signs of worms; rubbing at the nose.

If con'utlswiois ensue, treat as stated in that article, page 528. If the teeth are tardy in breaking through, do not lance them (it can only be of use where they are much swollen and hea~fd), but give learccea carb., every evening two glob., for a tweek; then discontinue a week, and give S0utlphur', in the samCle manner. Give the child frequently cold water to drink. If conslpoation, occurs during teething, give BBryonia and NuxT o. ica, alternately, every evening a dose (two glob.), for six days; beside, an injection of cold water every day. CONSTIPATION. It is a bad practice to give children physic, castor-oil, etc., which, although it may temporarily relieve the patients, renders them afterward more constipated than ever; when an injection, which would be quite as efficient, is so easily administered. First, however, give the following medicines: Bryonia,.Nux vomica and Opiumn, in succession, each remedy for one day, and three doses (two glob.) of each in a day. If not better, give Sulphur, in the same manner. Allow as much cold water as they will take, and rub their stomachs every evening well with sweet oil. If the above treatment does not produce the desired effect, give an injection of simple cold water, which, if ineffectual, may be followed by one consisting of tepid water and sweet oil, having dissolved in it a small piece of castile-soap.

(or in water, as usual); and lastly, Belladonna, in the same manner. By that time, the fever must have shown its character, or the child will be well. DIET.-Give a thirsty child as much cold water as it wants. DROPSY OF THE BRAIN. (iIy#droccphalus.) Children with large heads, and of a scrofulous taint, are more subject to this disease than others, as their brains are more liable to congestions. The most trivial derangement of the bowels, sudden change in the atrmosphere, teething, eruptive and other fevers; in fact, all diseases which may befall children, can, under certain circumstances, take their final and fatal issue through the dropsy of the brain, if timely aid does not prevent such a result. DIAGNosis.-~Whenever a child becomes drowsy, its head hot, feet cold, with or without nausea and retching, and sleeps wvith eyes half open, be careful and give it immediately the fo1lowing remedies: TREATMENT.-ByoJznia and Hellebor. (of each twelve glob. in half a teacupful of water), every hour or two hours a tea [Page 537](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/539) DnROPSY OP THE BRAIN. 537 spoonful, until four teaspoonfulls of each are given. or until the child becomes more lively. If the same drowsiness reappears, repeat the same medicine; if the third time, it appears, give Opiuam and Stlpl/ur, in the same manner, and afterward B.lch7tloia and a iellebor, as above. Let us illustrate the above treatment by a case in point. A child of Mro S., eight months old, was, in the hottest days (.T July, attacked with congestion of the brain, caused by teething during the most unfavorable time of the year. Witlhin the first few days of his sickness, nothing was done by the parents to arrest the progress of the disease, but when fiequent vomitil.g, after nur-sing or drinking, and a drowsy sta.te set in, my aid was required. The head was intensely hot, eyes half open, tongue parclhed and dry, thirst intense, yet, the least liquid swallowed would produce vomiting or gatgging; continual drowsiness, extreme languor, stool watery, frequent, of a light colored appearance. I ordered immediately ice-water to be poured over the head in a small but continuous stream, until the child would ar6,use from its lethargy, or close the eye-lids to fall into a natural sleep. Inwardly, I gave Bry/onia and Hellebor., in alternation, every half hour a teaspoonful, afterward, in lengthened intervals. This treatment, faithfully and to the letter carried out by the untiring parents, during twea7iy-four hours, produced the most happy results; the little patient revived, evidently as the congestion receded. As often as the latter would threaten to rceappear with increased heat in the head, the water was applie(l again as in the first instance. B3Nyonia and IIlcborl-. was colntinued for three days and then omitted; a relaxation of the bowels still remaining, yielded to alternate doses of China and Phosphoric afcid. Thus had vanished one of the most dangerous and severe diseases I had ever seen, and I attribute to the:omzbzinzd action of the water and the medicine its happy telmmination, which could not have been produced by either atlone, as I muysclf and [Page 538](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/540) 538 TREATMENT OF CHILDREN. othcrs h;tve frequently expcrienccd in other similar, but fatal ~ a, S:S. iie; e. I would yet remark, that in such severe cases, the s'igh-it qpplication of the water onI the head, by means of wet ra7:s, or even pounded ice in a bladder, is not sufficient; it l -i'clc the continually renewed fresh stream of the cold water, let it be ever so small. I_)', T must be light. Keep the feet warm, but the head c1,ld, witlh cloths dipped in ice water. It is evident, that in diseases of this kind, medical aid, if possible, should be obtained without delay. A S'i1HAIA OF CHILDREN. (Chokl1g fits. Asthma nza illari.) If:!it!e children seem almost to suffocate, fall into a spasm, aL:.d have a, bluish face, give Ipccac., one glob. every ten minutes; ald when it is characterized more by hard and tight distension of the stomach and around the short ribs, with s]horfness of,r' (Clt, H. c(o1i;:,y, anxiety, agitation and tossing, cries and retraction of the thighs, give Chanom;lde, one globule every ta enty or thirty minutes, until better.

When the tongue is dry, yet the patient is not thirsty; very petulant; does not want to see any one, or talk to any one. If head symptoms appear, see \"' Dropsy of the Brain.\" APPLICATION OF WATER.-If during the fever the skin is very hot and dry, perspiration may be promoted by packing the patient in a wet napkin or towel, well covered; in this he may remain until perspiration appears, when he is taken out and washed all over in tepid water. This process may be repeated as often as the fever returns. If during the packing the head becomes hot and congested, put cloths, dipped in cold water and well wrung out, on the head; change them frequen tly. DIET AND REGIMEN. \u2014 Gruels, toasted bread, soaked in [Page 540](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/542) 540 TREATM.ENT OF C'HILI)I-ENo. milk and water; no meat or broth; no eggs; keep thlem comfortably warm, always covered, particulcarly arms and linmbs. If perspiration appears, do not check it by exposure, as it frequently breaks the disease and shortens its cou rse. During convalescence be careful in the diet, as relapses frequently occur from errors in the diet. See what is said about it in \" qyphus.\" VTAcc INATION. It is in accordance with the homceopathic principle, that v.accination can save fr'om an attack of small-pox, the latter being- a similar (but not the same) disease to the former. Tlhrough vaccination the triumphs of lhomceopathy ihave been shrown to the world bSy innulnerable blessings, in arresting such a loathsome disease as small-pox. Vaccination, if salutary and truly protective, must not be netgligenl]y applied.

This disease is well known in the large cities, where it creates a fearful mortality among children, which are yet under allopathic treatment. Teething and the warm weather are its prominent causes; they are sufficient to produce all the subsequent changes, which make up the so-called summercomplaint. In general, careful attention to diet, bathing in [Page 542](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/544) 542 TREATMENT OF CHILDREN. cold or salt water, cool, refreshing air, on hills, or mountains, or in the high country, will do much to prevent or cure this disease. We would particularly request parents to notice the beginning symptoms of the disease in the child, and not to relax thdir efforts in subduing them, by the appearance of a few insiynifleant symptoms indicating recovery. The disease frequently changes, assuming, at intervals, a milder character, thus blinding the inexperienced; and this is mostly the case in that period, where, after the abdominal symptoms having grown less, apparently, the disease translates itself to the head, causing, eventually, dropsy of the brain. (Hydrocephialu.) In following the directions which we will give below for the trcatment of this disease, we would request parents to observe closely, that part of it which refers to the prevention of any transfer of the disease to the head, as this process is of the highest importance, yet easily to be accomplished if once understoo i, and faithfully carried out. Here might be the place to give a reason for the above suggestion, whch would reach and satisfy even popular understanding. It is the first and most important rule in the treatment of any disease, to direct our curative attention to that organ, which. in its vital dignity, ranks the highest, if this organ is alr-ady, or is threatened to be, affected seriously. Now, the brain is the most important organ in the whole system, and in children its structure is particularly exposed to fatal disorganization; we must therefore, be always on guard to take care of this organ in children's diseases, and frequently prevent its being affected, by not giving the disease a chance, through tardy action, to develop itself in that place. In summer-complaint it is frequently the case, that we are called upon to prescribe for the head symptoms, in order to relieve the bowels. We will give below especial directions, so that no one can mistake the time when,. or the manner how, to administer the few [Page 543](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/545) S AMMER COMPLAINT. 543 but sure remedies, we have to offer for the treatment of this feari'ul malady. I DIAGNOSIS.-As the hot season advances, the child, even if it was healthy before, begins to droop, and becomues languid; the appetite fails gradually, and frequent gagging or sickness of the s wuilmah will appear; finally, it begins to throw up the food; after which, generally, the first symptomis of diarrhea manifest themselves. Froml this time, all the above symptoms increase rapidly; the sleep begins to be disturbed, the strei:lgth is sensibly reduced; the decrease in flesh is already perceptible, and the little patient ceases to be able to stand alole or walk, if this had been done before. Slight fever in the evening with restlessness during the night, now sets in, the diarrhea inlcreases in frequency, becomes more watery, offensive, and sometimes almost colorless; during the fever, one chlelk is hihly colored, while the other is pale, the little heads andt' fctt burn, and the thirst for water is craving.'lhe appetite for solid or mucilaginous food grows less, and the child refuscs every thing almost but water; it gags at the sight of food.'i he little sufferer now declines more rapidly; the gumns begin to swell and become very tender, the mouth sore, and little blisters appear' 0on the tongue and the roof of the mouth, reselmbiing aphthae or thrush; these symptoms indicate the co1mmencement of dissolution; there appear simultaneous with the:m, small red stitches (petclhice) on the body, limbs, and faeei. like flea-bites; hands and feet now are frequently cold, whilet the head is hot; the feet swell, edematious. At this stag the slightest provocation, such as stopping the action of the h.ov.cis by olpiatecs, drives the disease to the head, andc dropsy of hlie brainl ensues. If that is not the case. the lungs become;ffi cted, a cough sets in, and the child sinks gradually, and dies in a decline.! This is the natural course of the disease when left to itself, or when unwisely treated by harsh and undue remedies. The causes of the disease are unfortunttely such, that we [Page 544](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/546) 544 TREATMENT OF CHILDREN. can not remove them entirely; they are, in most cases, teething, and the hot season of the year. If these two conditions happen to occur at the same time, we have to be extremely careful. In cases where faults in diet have fostered the attack, the dis:~ase, generally, is not obstinate, and the child soon recovers; such an attack we might designate, however, as cho1cra 6infan-.liiZ, which, in our opinion, is a different disease from summer-complaint, although very similar to it in its appearance, p;rltitcularly at the commencement. Cholera infantlt is more sudden and acute in its nature, while summer-complaint generally appears in a chronic form. TREATMENT.-To avoid the disease: it is well understood, that a removal into the country or to the sea-board, is an effcictual means for that purpose. Yet it can not be always convenient or possible; we must, therefore, know what best to do in case the enemy has to be met. A careful attention to diet;and dress, and a frequent access to the open air, are the principal means to ward off the disease. The child should be kept at the breast until after the second summer; if it can not be done, the weaning ought to take place before the hot season sets in; after the weaning, the child's nourishment must be uniform and not the least change made, if the child thrives under it, for the sake of experiment or because the child wants it. The food may consist of milk, with arrow-root, rice, farina, sago, tapioca, etc., occasionally a little plain chicken or muttonwater, with rice well done, in it; fruits, greens and other gar den vegetables, are not wholesome during this period; sweet potatoes are allowed. The dress must be cool, not oppressive; a light flannel shirt with a muslin petticoat and frock, light or no socks at all, are sufficient during the heat of the summer; during occasional cool changes of the weather, to the above dress is added, a light flannel petticoat. The child ought to be as much in the open air as possible, in the shade of trees or houses, particularly morning and [Page 545](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/547) SUMMIER COMPLAINT. 545 evenin;g, and great care has to be taken, not to expose the chlild's head to the burning rays of the sun, without being well protected. or to let the inlfant sit or crawl in places which are wet ani.cd damrp. T'he child ought to have a cool or tepid bath in the morning, and be washed over the entire body, evenings, w'th tepid or luke-warm water; the water for the evening bath must not be cool. Thlse general rules strictly observed, a child seldom will be taken with the summer-complaint. But if the first symptoms of t.he disease should appear, viz: languor, gagging, and in alterlnation, every two hours a dose (three globules), until better. If, however, the vomiting and diarrhea continues, the stools become lightish. mixed with white flocks and tinged with bloocl, give.IIecac. and VeFratrum in alterin'tion, every h ur or hour a dose (three globules), until better. Cribo vcgetaldilis after the Bryonia or Teratlzuni, if the discharges are very watery and offensive, with pain and great weakness; every evening and morning a dose (three globules).

Ars.-iciLa7u, for similar symptoms and frequently in talternation with V;.ratrmln, more, however, in the latter state of the disease, when the chiild becomes very much emaciated, extremities cold, swelling of the feet sets in with great restlessness and unea sin: ss. -M3'c-uray if the diarrhea borders on dysentery; severe straining durling and after an evacuation, falling of the 46 [Page 546](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/548) 546 TREATSMENT OF CHILDREN. rectum, scanty, bloody and greenish stools sometimes with nausea. Sulphur frequently suits well after Mercu~ry, particularly when the latter remedy has removed those symptoms of dysentery, for which it was administered, and there are still remaining frequent thin and watery, greenish or whitish and slimy evacuations. At any time during this disease, when feverish symptoms appear, as heat or unusual warmth in the head, with drowsiness or languor, we must at once have recourse to the treatment for congestions of the head, which we now will give. This is so important in the successful treatment of this disease, that we would draw the especial attention of the practitioner and parents, to the necessity of employing these remedies in the early stage of the disease, and not to wait until the head symptoms develop themselves to any great extent. As, to our knowledge, no physician heretofore has mentioned this treatment as particularly necessary for a successful issue of this disease, we felt more anxious to point it out as such, and would only add yet to support our position, that we frequently have cured the whole disease with the application of only two sets of remedies; first Bryonia and Helleborus in alternation, dissolved in water; every two hours a teaspoonful, until four, six, or eight are taken, then after an interval of ten or twelve hours, repeated again a few times. Secondly, if diarrhea still was left, China and Phosphoric acid in alternation; after every operation a dose (three globules), until the discharges become more regulated. In most cases the Bryonia and Helleborus was sufficient to relieve the patient in such a degree, and change the nature of the discharge in such a manner, that no other medicine was needed. The light color of the stool would change into a yellow and brownish, with a great degree of consistency. The physiological reason of this singular phenomenon lies in the sympathetic effect of the brain on the liver; after the brain is relieved by the exhibition [Page 547](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/549) SUMMER COMPLAINT. 547 of Bryonia and ielleborus, the normal action of the liver commences again, and not sooner. We have found this method eminently successful in southern climates, where the constitution is naturally more delicate. The only author we know of, who seems to have entertained similar views to those expressed above, namely, to pay, in the treatment of this disease, more attention to the head, than is usually done, is Dr. EBERLE, who recommends the application of a blister behind the ears, or to the back of the neck, stating, that he has been much more successful since the adoption of this plan, than previously. He was led to the employment of this method by the example of Dr. PARRISH, who began it from observing that \"infants who have the eruption behind the ears, so common during dentition, generally enjoy an exemption from those dangerous disorders incident to this critical period of life.\" Although we may differ from Dr. EBERLE or Dr. PARRISH in the reasons whv such a method should be adopted, we agree with them in the fact, that highly beneficial results flow from it, and the more so, as we use for that purpose, specific remedies, Bryoo.oia and Helleborus, acting directly and powerfully on the engorged brain, while Dr. EBERLE only proposes a revulsive agent in the shape of a blister, which never can produce such deep and lasting effects on the brain, as the above named remedies. Thus Allopathy and Homoeopathy, while they agree in the observation of facts even to the nicest details, show their difference in choosing the proper means to arrive at their proposed ends. For the benefit of our brethren in practice, we would here remark, that in almost all children diseases, the application of Bryonia and Helleborus is of the greatest importance, particularly, when there is the slightest congestion to the head apparent; it answers fully that state, in which the Allopath would apply a fly-blister, or give calomel. CONVALEScENCE. \u2014This stage needs only regulations of diet and strict observance of hygienic rules. We frequently have allowed children to eat sweet pickled pork, well fried, [Page 548](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/550) 548 TREATMENT OF CHILDREN. or sweet potatous. well roasted; particularly when the little patients were fond of them. Fresh air and frequent washing ail.d b.;thilng is recommended; as, also, a playful entertainment of the little patient, who now begins with returning health to smile again, and look around cheerful and happy. SOFTENING OF THE STOMACH-GASTRO-MALACIA. A description of this most dangerous disease of infants, is perhaps the more necessary, as it is frequently mistaken for dropsy of the brain, cholera infantum, or ailments connected with difficult teething. It consists in a partial softening of the walls of the stomach, particularly at its blind extension next to the spleen. The membranes of the stomach soften, become gelatinous, frequently transparent, and if the disease is not cured, the affected parts become perforated as if cut out by a knife. It is, indeed, gangrene of the stomach. Diaynosis. Sudden restlessness with hoarse, anxious crying; vomiting immediately after nursing or eating; sour and pultridl snmell of what is vomited; swelling of the abdomen, and especially of the stomach which feels very hot; pale, collapsed face, sunken eyes, cold extremities; fever toward evening; the child emaciates rapidly, its features become distorted, the swellingr and heat of the abdomen increases, finally stupor and hiccoulh ensue. The diarrhea heretofore present, now ceases, and the child soon dies. The disease sometimes passes rapidly throu'h these phenomena, but generally lasts from two to five days. TREATMENT.-A large experience in the treatment of this disease has convinced me that Secale corn. is the specific in all its stages.

ANATOMY describes the mechanism and structure of tilh parts of the human system, while PHYSIOLOGY treats of the laws by which the organism is governed, and the various functions in man are performed. From the above it may be seen how closely these two sciences are related to each other, and that it is almost impossible to treat of them separately, without great disadvantage. They will appear, in this short treatise, interwoven with each other, as the necessity of a clear exposition of their details may require. The study of anatomy and physiology must be interesting to every one, who wants to know a little more of the wonderful creations and provisions of an allwise Providence, than an outside view of nature around him can give. But it is not alone the thirst for increased knowledge which is satisfied by studying the human system and its laws; this knowledge is often highly beneficial to our physical welfare, and is particularly necessary for those who, from necessity or philanthropy, undertake to minister to the sufferings of their fellow-beings: and to this category not merely the professional physician belongs, in whose hands life and health are trusted, but all men, if possible, should enrich their minds with the treasures of a science whose teachings lighten, to so great an extent, the burden and responsibility of the healing art; particularly as no one knows whether he might not be called upon, in some emergency, to practice medicine to the extent of his knowledge. Viowed in this light, it becomes the duty of every one (551) [Page 552](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/554) 55'02 ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. who prescribes at all in diseases, to make himself acquainted with the human system and the laws of health, as this knowledge only enables him to decide competently where health ceases and disease commences. For a successful and sauisfactory use of the prescriptions laid down in a domestic physician, some knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the human system is indispensable, and we recommend, strongly, a repeated and careful perusal of the following pages.* STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN ORGANISM. The human body consists of fluids and solids, changing constantly from one into the other; their proportion to each other varies in different individuals and at different periods of life. In youth, the fluids are more abundant than in advanced age. The liquids contain, as it were, the whole body in its elementary particles, which by organical attraction, are formed into the different solid parts of the system. These exist in different degrees of solidity, as their different uses require. The simplest form of organized animal substance is a membrane, or tissue, composed of fibres interwoven like a network; all organs are formed by tissues, which are (lifferent, and adapted to their uses. The mucous membranes line all the cavities which communicate witli the air, as the mouth, nostrils, intestinal canal, lungs, etc., and are covered with minute cells, wlhich secrete a viscid fluid called mucus, to protect the inner surfaces of the cavities from the contact with the air. The serous membranes line cavities wl]ich do not communicate with the air, as the skull. chest, -abdonmen, etc. A serous membrane is a shut sac, wite one layer opposed to the wall of the cavity, and the other folded around the contents m If a more extended acqliaintalnce is desired with these.lecessary branches of pract-ical medicinle, it call satisfalctorily be foid(1 ill the work of Calvin Cutter, M. D., on alnatormy, physiology, and lygiiene, which we nmostly followed in tand [Page OF TIHE HUMAN ORGANISM. 653 of tile cavity; which contents are outside of the sac. A serous fluid is secreted between the sides of the sacs, to keep them moist and movable. Areolar tissue, otherwise called cellular, is extensively distributed througohout the system, and is useful in enveloping org'ans and parts of organs, especially where a considerable degree of motion is required; which motion it never impede-, being abundantly supplied with fluid. The adilpo0se tissue forms distinct bags or cells, filled with fat, and is principally located beneath the skin, and around tlhe heart and kidneys. The cut aneous membrane forms the outside covering of the body, called the skin, and is similar in its structure (although harder), to the mucous membrane, of which it forms the external continuation. It secretes, constantly, a fluid called perspiration, if it appears in large quantities; it exists mostly, however, in an imperceptible vapor, which, as it were, constitutes the atmosphere of the body. Thcfibrous tissue forms a thin, dense, strong membrane, and is found where a strong protection is needed, as in the lining of the internal, surface of the skull, around the bones, and at the end of the muscles; here it constitutes the so-called ligaments and tendons. The catrtilaginous tissue covers the ends of the bones, where they concur in forming a joint, and is, on that account, firm, smooth, and elastic. The osseous tissue, which composes the bones, varies in different periods of life, as regards solidity and density. The muscular tissue consists of many filaments, which united, form fibres, each of which is inclosed in a fine layer of areolar tissue, called sarcolemma. Muscles are composed of bundles of these fibres. The nervous tissue is composed of two distinct substances, one gray and vascular, the other white and fibrous. The gray forms the external part of the brain, and the internal part of 47 -. [Page 554](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/556) 554 ANATOnMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. the spinal cord; while thle nerves are composed of the white, inclosed in a sheath called nezurilemma. ELEMENTS OF THIE HUMAN ORGANISM. These are: first, inorganic (chemical); or, second, organic (elementary products of the system itself). 1. The inoryanic or chemnical elements. These are: a. llietallic substances, as Potash, Soda, Lime, Magnesia, Alum, Silex, Manganese, Copper, and Iron. b. N3on-metallic substances, as Oxygen, Hydrogen, Carbon. Nitrogen, Phosphor, Sulphur, Prussic acid, etc. 2. The organic elements are: Fibrin, Gelatin, Mucus, and Osmazome, etc. ANATOMY OF TIHE BONES. The bones, giving strength and solidity to the system, are so united among themselves, and adapted to each other, that they admit of the most numerous and various actions. The elevations or protuberances of the bones are called processes, which generally form the points of attachment for the muscles and ligaments. They are composed of earthy and animal matter; the former giving strengtl, the latter vitality. At the earliest stage of formation, the hones are cartilaginouis, soft, and tender, and become bard and ossified as soon as deposits of phosphate and carbonate of lime commence, at certain points, called points qf ossfication. The periosteum or fibrous mnembrane investing the bones, except where they are tipped with cartilage, at certain points, gives vitality and nutrition to the bone. There are two hundred and eight bones in the human body, beside the teeth. They are divided into four parts. First. The bones of the head. Second. Of the trunk. Third. Of the upper extremities. Fourth. Of the lower extremities. [Page 555](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/557) ANATOMY OF TIIE BONES. 555 1. Th/e bones of the head. They consist of those of the skhull, ear, and face. T'he bones of the skull, of which there are eight, consist of two plates or tablets of bony matter, united by a porous portion of bone; the external tablet is fibrous and tough, the internal, dense, hard, and glossy. Thus, the skull is admirably adapted to resist the penetration of sharp instruments, or diminish any vibration occasioned by falls and blows. The skull is convex externally, and at the base much thicker than at the top or sides; its bones are, as it were, sewed together, united by sutures, whose rugged edges interlock with each other, producing a union, called, by carpenters, dovetailindg. In early infancy the bones are not united, leaving interstices of considerable extent, which fill up slowly with bony matter; thus allowing, in the early time of infancy, sufficient room for the expansion of the brain, which, in this time of life, is particularly liable to destructive congestions. No part of the human structure contributes more to the difference existing among the races of mankind than does the skull; in this too are found those eminences and depressions which indicate to the phrenologist the development of the brain. In eacll ear are four very small bones, which aid in hearin'. In the face we count fourteen bones, some of them serving for the attachment of powerful muscles for masticating food, otlhers to retain in place the soft parts of the face. The face forms the most interesting part of the human system, with its lrays of intelligence and joy, or its clouds of distress or sorrow; and thus with its wonderful play of passional expression is made the dial-plate of the inner man. 2. The trunk has fifty-four bones: viz., twenty-four ribs, twenty-four bones in the spinal column (back-bone), four in the pelvis (forming the hips), the breast-bone (sternum), and the bone at the base of the tongue (os hyoides). They are [Page 556](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/558) 556 ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. so arrangced as to form, with the soft parts attached to them, two cavities, called the thiorax (chest) and abdomen. The thorax is formed by the breast-bone in front, the ribs at the sides, and the twelve dorsal bones of the spinal column in the back; this cavity contains the lungs, heart, and larg6 blood-vessels; its natural form is a cone, with its point above, yet fashion often inverts this order boldly, but never without paying the due penalty in diminution of life and happiness. The breast-bone (sternum) consists ofeight pieces, in a child, which after uniting, form but three parts in adults; the lower part of the sternuim reaching overi into the pit of the stomach, remains cartilaginous and flexible until old age, when it is often converted into bone. The ribs are connected with the spinal column, and increase in length as far as the seventh, where they become shorter. Tlhe seven upper ribs are fiastened to the sternum by cartilages, to facilitate their motions in breathing; they are called the true ribs. The next three are united to each other by cartilagwes, not touchingr the sternum \u2014tllerefore called false ribs; whlile the latter two, or lowest ribs, are not connected either with the sternum or the other ribs, therefore, called floating ribs. The spinal column contains twenty-four pieces of bone, called lertebrce. Each of the vertebrae has seven projections, called processes, four of which, called articulating processes, join similar ones of the adjacent vertebre to form the collmn; two of the remaining processes are called transverse, and the other the spinous process; these processes receive the muscles of the back and neck, to allow a firm and elastic motion to the spinal column in all directions. A canal or tube runs through all the vertebrme in one continuous descent from the round aperture in the skull, to contain the spinal cord (medulla spinalis), the immediate continuation of the brain. J-Between the.vertebrm is a cartilaginous and highly elastic [Page 557](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/559) ANATOMY OF TI-IE BONES 5 7 substance, whichl facilitates the mnovements of tile spine, and diminishes any shock in walking, running, or leaping, which would otherwise hurt the spine or brain. The pelvis, or the bones forming the hip, consists of four parts, two of which are called innbminata or nameless bones; these, in particular, form the hip, having externally, at each side a deep socket like a cup, for the reception of the round head of the thi-gh bone; internally these bones, in conjunction with the sacrum, form a cavity, which contains those organs called pelvic, as the bladder, rectum, sexual organs, etc. The sacrum belongs to the pelvis, forming its posterior part; it is placed between the hip-bones, to which it is bound by ligaments; it is, in reality, the continuation of the vertebra, and forms part of the spinal column, which is terminated, finally, by a small appendix called coccyx, in youth, consisting of four pieces, uniting, however, in more advanced age, into one bone, which, in females, is more movable than in males, for a wise purpose. Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Representing the bones of the trunk. 1, Clavicula or collar-bone; 2, sternum or breast-bone; 3, last true, X or seventh rib; 4, last false, or twelfth rib; 5, spinal column; 6, the innonminata (nameless bones); 7, the sacrum; 8, socket for the head of the thighbone. 3. The bones of the upper and lower limbs are enlarged at each extremity, where tendons, muscles, and ligaments are attached. 1'f The bones of the extremities are mostly in the form of cylindrical and lhollow shafts. L''lie blade (scapula), arm-bone (humerus), two bones and radius ), the wrist (cassus), the metacarpuzs (palm of the hand), and the fingers and thumb (plclanges). The collar-bone (clavicula, see fig. 1, No. 1), is attached at one end to the breast-bone, at the other to the shoulder bone: it is shaped like the italic f, and its use is to prevent the arms from sliding toward the breast; a fracture of this bone requires a more complicated bandage to keep the broken parts together, than any other within the range of surgery. The shoulder-blade (scapula) lies on the upper and back part of the chest, forming the shoulder, where the upper arm bone inserts itself in a shallow (glenoid) cavity, surrounded by a strong ligament (capsular); the shoulder-blade itself is a thin; flat, and triangular bone, covering the back, and remains in its position, or moves in different directions, by numerous muscles which adhere to its projections. The upper arm (humerus) forms a connection, at the elbow, with the ulna of the fore-arm, and at the shoulder, its round head is applied to the glenoid cavity of' the scapula, in which it is firmly confined by the capsular ligament, thus forming the most movable joint in the whole system. The lower or fore-arm is composed of two bones, called ulna and radiuts: the former articulates with the humerus at the elbow, forming a perfect hinge-joint; this bone is located on the inner side of the fore-arm, while the latter, the radius, lies on the outside of the fore-arm (on the side where the thumb is placed), and articulates with the bones of the wrist. forming the wrist-joint; the ulna and radius, at their extremities, articulate with each other, so that the hand can rotate, permitting its complicated and varied movements. The wrist (carzpus) consists of eight bones, ranged in two rows, and firmly bound together, thus allowing only a small amount of movement.

The palm of the hand (melacalp:us) contains five bones, foni of which alre joined with the first range of finger-bones, and the other with the first bone of the thumb. The fingers have three ranges of bones (pllalanges), while the thumb has but two. N. B. The mechanism of the hand, with its wonderful adaptation to all the various purposes of life, is one of the many facts which indicate man's superiority over the rest of the animal creation, and must excite in us the deepest interest and astonishment at the Divine wisdom and power. The lower extremities comprise sixty bones, analog'ous in construction and form to the upper extremities; the thigh-bone (femur); the cap of the knee (patella); tilhe shin-bone (tibia); the small bone of the leg on the outside of the tibia (fibula); the instep (tarsus); the middle of the foot (metatarsus); and the toes (phlalanges). The thigh-bone is the longest and strongest bone in the systerm, supporting the weight of the whole body. Its upper part, a large round head, fills a corresponding cavity in the pelvis and forms the so-called hip-joint, thus admirably fitted, in its mechanism, for its various offices requiring strength and motion. The cap of the knee (patella) is a small bone in fiont of the knee, connected with the thigh-bone by a strong ligament; it acts like a pulley, in the extension of the limb. The shin-bone (tibia) is the largest bone of the lower part of the legc, of a triangular shape, and considerably enlarged at each extremity. The small-bone of the leg (fibula) is of a similar shape with tile formler, but smaller, and bound firmly to it at each extremity. It lies on the outside of the leg. The instep (tarsus) is formed of seven irregularly-shaped bones, so firmly bound together by ligaments as to allow of but little movement. The palm of the foot (metatarsus) consists of five bones, correspond(ing to the five toes, with which they articulate on [Page 561](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/563) ANATOMY OF THE BONES. 31 the front extremity, while on the lhinder one, they arlticulate wiLli one range of the bones of the instep. By this arrangement, an arch is forlmed, convex above and. concave below, whicli gives elasticity to the step, preventing the jarring of the wliole fiaime by any weight thrown upon the feet, in their various use;. Th'e toes are composed of fourteen bones (p/zhalanges); each of thle small toes has three, while the great toe t.as tbui two ranges of bones. Fig 5. ig. 6. Figr..

The bones, by their solidity and form, retain every part of the system in its proper shape. They not only afforl points of attachlment for the muscles and ligaments, to lold the body toogether and bring it into motion, but they protect, in strong, bony cavities, all the important organs fiom external injuries, such as the brain, the eyes, etc. The bones grow and decay, like any other tissue, by new particles being deposited from out the blood, and old, useless matter removed, by the constant action of the absorbingy vessels. This has been tested thoroughly. Some of the inferior animals were fed with food containing madder. After a few days, several of these animals were killed, and their bones exhibited an unusual reddish appearance. lThe rest of the animals were for a few weeks fed on ordinary food, without containing madder, and when killed their bones had the natural color again. The extremities of the bones are the best suited to form joints; for which purpose their texture is more porous, consequently more elastic, and the external surface of the parts imrnediately joining each other in a joint is covered with a cushion of cartilage, to diminish jarring or grinding. The contemplation of each minute particle, its uses and applicalion in the system, its appropriate location, etc., the thousand wonderful machines which can be observed, acting usefully and quietly in our systems, reveal more and more the wislom and omnipotence of the great Arichitect. Won der and adoration fill the heart of the beholder of such creations as the lhuman body, in its detail and in its whole, as a complete and noble machine, to run the errands of the holier part of man, thle soul. The bones serve, in the animal frame, as a proper basis; the liogaments hold the bones in their proper places firmly, as if clasped by steel, yet with room to move. They surround the joints like a hood, or extend from one bone to the other, in [Page 564](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/566) 6A ANA'rOATMY AND P-IYSIOLOGY. tlhe form of side lavers. By these ligaments, tlle lower jaw is bound to the temporal bones, and the head to the neck. Thley extend the whole length of the spinal column, in strong bands, on the outer surface, as well as within the spinal canal, and from one spinous process to another. The joints are different as regards movement and complexity of structure. Some permit motions in all directions, as tlhe shoulder; some in two directions, as the elbow, allowing flexion and extension; others in three and more directions; otlhers, again, have no movement at all, as the bones of the skull, in adults. THE MusCLEs..A muscle consists of bundles of fibres of different size. each one inclosed in an areolar membranous sheath. Everv bundle is composed of small fibres, and each fibre of numerous filaments, each of which is inclosed in a delicate sheath. At the end of the muscle, the fibrous substance ceases, and the tendlon (cord) commences, by which the muscle is attached to the bone. The union is so firml, that. the bone will sooner break than permit the tendon to separate friom its attachment. l'lhe forn- of the muscles varies very much, acor(ding to their uses. It is either longitudinal, havin-; a tendon at each ex!:remitv, or it diverges in the form of a fan, called a radiate nmu:,cle. Otahers are penniform, converging, like the plumes of a pein, to one side of a tendon; or bi-penniformn, where they thus converge on both sides of a, tendon. The color of0 a muscle is red; each fibre is supplied wi;th al;e'ies, veins, lymplhatics, and nerves, both of' sensation and motion. Where a great many muscles congregate arotund an organ, they are inclosed in a fascia, a fibrous membrane,, which a iL-: thle niuscles in their action by ke eping tonic plessn'e oln muscles are also inclosed in fasciv, and arranged in layers, as their use requires it. The interstices between the different muscles are filled with fat, which gives to the body roundness and beauty. We may arrange the muscles into four parts; those, 1. Of the head and neck. 2. Of the trunk. 3. Of the upper extremities. 4. Of the lozwer extremities. As it is impossible to give an interesting detail of the muscles of the body, their insertions and names, without illustrating them by plates, we content ourselves with the following general remarks. There are more than five hundred muscles in the human body, forming, around the skeleton two layers, a superficial and deep-seated one. Some muscles are voluntary, under the control of the will, such as those on the fingers, limbs, etc.; others are involuntary, as the heart. On the back, the muscles are arranged in six layers, one above the other, for the complicated movements which the back, neck, the upper extremities, and the abdomen require. The diaphragm is a muscle which needs particular explanation. It is located between the chest and abdomen, separating them completely; being penetrated only by the pipe leading to the stomach, and by the great blood-vessels, leading fi-om and to the heart. It may be compared to an inverted basin, its bottom being turned upward into the chest, its edges corresponding to the outline of the edges of the lower ribs and breast-bone. Thus, the cavity of the abdomen is enlarged at the expense of that of the chest. Respiration, however, changes the natural position of the diaphragm constantly, facilitating this process by its own action. During inhalation, the diaphragm descends into the abdomen, enlarging the chest; during exhalation, the reverse takes place; thus a constant and healthy action is given to both the res [Page 566](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/568) 56 s6 ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. piratory and digestive orgians. In this place we should mention. the great benefit which results from inhaling deep, to the full extent of the lungs, wllich is greatly facilitated by exercising the abdominal muscles, causing' them to swell out when inhaling, and drawing them back when in the act of,i1xbaling. A little exercise in this way, will soon show the good result-s in the ease, and full extent to which the lungs ccan be filled. The action of the muscles, in performing their various functions, can be explained only by the supposition of an inherent contractility, as a peculiar characterisLic of the muscular fibre, which can shorten its substance, wheii a sufficient stimulus acts on it. This stimulus is the nervous fluid, directed to the muscles by the will, if voluntary actions shall be performed, or, independently of the will, when the involuntarvy actions are wanted, such'as the beatino of the heart, etc. The nature of this nervous influence niay be analogous to a galvanic or electrical current' as these agents, when actin7 on the muscles, produce similar effects. The rapidity with which the musclesmove, is, truly astonishin g, as any one can observe, in rapid speaking, or playing upon instruments. It is not alone the size of the muscle whicll determines its strength'; but, also, the size of the ntrl'ves which lead to it, and the size and activity of the brain, lwhicli must supply the nervous fluid necessary as a stimulus to action.

The incisors, cuspids, and bicuspids have each but one root. The molars of the upper jaw have three roots, while those of the lower jaw have but two. ALIMENTARY ORGANS. These comprise the mouth and teeth, salivary glands, phaarynx, oesophagus (stomach-pipe), stomach, intestines, lacteals (milk, or chyle vessels), thoracic duct, liver, and pancreas. The mouth contains the instruments of mastication and the organs of taste. The preparation of food for digestion commences already in the mouth, where it is masticated and mixed with saliva from the salivary glands, of which there are six, three on each side of the jaw. Their names and positions are' The parotid gland lies in front of the external ear, and behind the angle of the jaw; its duct opens into the mouth, opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw; this gland is swollen and inflamed when children have the mumps. The submaxillary gland lies within the lower jaw, anterior to its angle. Its duct opens into the mouth by the side of the string or bridle of the tongue (frmenum linguee), on each side of which lies The sublingual gland, of an elongated and flaIt.ened form, beneath the tongue; it empties its saliva throug-h seven om eighlt small ducts, into the mouth, by the side of the string of the tongue; a disease called the \"frog\" eensietA mouth, and foirms that cavityI imrnediately below tlle palate where four passaCges unite, tw\\o Comino' from the nose and mouth, the otller two goingn to the stomach and lungs.

The stomach lies on the left side of the abdomen, immediately below the diaphragmn, where the stonlmach-pipe enters its upper part at an opening called tl:e cardia; from this point it enlarges into a, sack, wlhichl lies wiidh its larger end on the left side, while its smaller end( contracuts gradually toward the pit of the stomaclh, where it empties into the intestines t[his opening in the stomach is called the pylorus. The stomaclh has, beside the mucous and muscllar coats, an outer1 or serous coat., which is very toughii and strong, of a smooth and highflly polished appeara-nce, and confines the stomach in itS proper location. The stomach has a great number of glands, to secrete the gastlic juice. The intestines, or alimentiary canal, are divided into two parts, the s3w2ll and large. The former, commencing at the stoma-Cch. measures about twenty-five feet, while the large intesline, ending at the rectum, is about five feet in length. Thlle latter is divided into three parts, thle cwocuni, (the beoinning of the large intestine), which lies near the rioght upper hip-bone; the colon, which, from this point on the right side, ascends to the region below the liver, then transversely crosses the upper part of the abdomlren, from below the liver, to the lower part1; of the stomach on the left side, where it bends atgain, descending to the left hip-bone, and enterin(g the cavity of the pelvis, being called lhere the recthm. Th're small intestine, commencing at the stomach and ending 48 [Page 570](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/572) 570 ANATOMY AND PIIYSIOLOGY. at the cocum, is also divided into three parts; the duodenum, called so from beihg generally twelve fingers long, commences at the stomach, ascends obliquely to the under surface of the liver, then descends perpendicularly (where it receives the ducts from the liver and pancreas), and passes transversely across the lower portion of the spinal column behind the colon, terminating in the jejunum, its continuation; and this, in its turn, is continued by the ileum, which empties itself into the cocum, at the right hip, after the small intestines have made numerous windings. While the stomach and intestines receive the food for digestion, and assimilate it, various other secretions from the liver, pancreas, etc., enter the alimentary canal to foster this process, and still other vessels are ready to absorb the assimilated juice and carry it into the circulation of the blood. Of the latter are the lacteals or minute vessels, which commence on the mucous membrane of the small intestines; from these they pass between the membranes of the mesentery to small glands, out of a collection of which larger vessels run to another range of glands, and so on, through several ranges of these glandular bodies, until they all empty themselves into one large duct, called the left thoracic duct, which ascends from the abdomen upward, lying in front of tile spinal column, and passes through the diaphragm to the lower part of the neck; here it makes a sudden turn downward and forward, emptying itself into a large vein, which passes into the heart; its diameter is equal to a goose-quill. The liver is a gland, which lies under the short-ribs of the right side, below the diaphragm, and is composed of several lobes; its upper surface is convex, its lower concave; it is the largest organ in the system, weighing about four pounds; its use is to secrete the bile, a fluid so necessary for chylification. The gall-bladder, containing the surplus of bile not immediately necessary for the system, being, as it were, a reservoir, lies on the under surface of the liver, and empties into [Page 571](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/573) ALM',NTAYi OnIANS. 571 the gall duet, which carries the bilious fluid to its dest;nation in the duodenul-m. The pancreas is a long, flattened gland, similar to thle salivary glands on the neck; it is about six inches longo, weighs three or four ounces, and lies transversely across the posterior wall of the abdomen, behind the stomach; its product, a saliva or p)ancreatic juice (necessary for digestion), is carried by a duct into the intestines in the duodenum, just where the gall duct opens into the intestines. The spleen (milt), of an oblong, flattened form, lies in the left side below and touching the diaphragm, stomacL, and pancreas. It is a reservoir capable of containing a great quantity of blood, ready for the purpose of the liver, to secrete the bile. Tlhe blood, in patssing throughl the spleen, loses a portion of its red globules and thus becomes less stimulating. The omenturn (caul) descending in four layers of serous membrane from the stomach and transverse colon, contains fatty matter, deposited around the vessels, which ramify through its structure. Its functions are: to protect the intestines fiom. cold, and to facilitate their movements. The whole digestive apparatus is supplied with arteries, veins, lymphatics, and nerves; the latter chiefly fiom the gangliionic system. (See tllis.) One of the most wonderful processes in the animal economy is that of the assimilation of food. During its mastication (chewing) a considerable quantity of saliva (spittle) is mixed with it, the object of which is, to soften and moisten the food, preparing it for easy deglutition. When it reaches the stomach, it is subjected to the powerful action of the so-called stomacli-juice (gastric juice), which is secreted by the glands, immediately located in the substance of the stomach. Beside, it is constantly in motion by the action of the muscles of the stomach, which brings the food into conttact witlh the mucous membrane, and thus it becomes completely saturated with gastric juice, and at length dis.

From the above it is seen that the bile has no agency in the clhange through which tle food passes in the stomach. Th e common belief, that bile is in the stomach, is erroneous. If bile is ejected in vomiting, it merely shows that not only the action of the stomach is inverted, but also that of the duodenum. Emetics will, generally, bring bile from the most healthy stomach, by inverting the action of the stomach and duodenum; the expression being bilious, having' a bilious attack, etc., is gene-rally wrong', the bile having nothing to do with these disorlde-rs, for whictl a better expression would be; the stomach is out of order; if persons, generally, would know this fact, a creat deal of wrong and disastrous treatment would be avoided, as they would not force the stomach to eject bile continually, where there is none located. THE URINARY SYSTEM. This system, whose duty it is to secrete and carry out of the system tle urine, is composed of the kidneys, the ureters, and the bladder, with the urethrall attached to it. The kidneys, between four andf five inches long, and two and a half broad, lie in the lumbar retgion, behind the peritoneunm, on each side of the vertebrt. Their texture is dense and fragile, presenting, in its interior, two structures, an external (cortical), and an internal (medullary) substance. The former contains the blood-vessels, which carry the blood from which the urine slhall be separated; the latter consists of tubes, which conduct the urine away fiom the secreting vessels. It is then received in the pelvis of the kidney, from. which it runs into the ureter, the excretory duct of the kidney, a membranous tube of the size of a goose-quill, about eighteen inches in length; this runs down along' the posterior wall of the abdomen, behind the peritoneum and crossed by the -\"- -,. -..- -,,,,.. [Page 574](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/576) 5 o74 spermatic to the bla.dder in f'ront, in which it empties from behind and on thle side. The bladlder is of an oblong', ovoid shape, situated behind thle os pubis and in front of the rectum. it is the reservoir for thle urine, which1 is carried there by the two ureters from the kidneys. It is retained in its position by eleven li'aments, supporting it on all sides. The bladder is composed of three coats, an external, or serous, a muscular, and a mucous, or internal coat. The urcetlra is the membranous canal issuino- from the neck of the bladder. It is curved in its course, composed of two layers, a mucous and an elastic fibrous coat. Through it passes the urine olt of the body. Ttim RESPIRATORY AND CIRCULATORY ORGANS. These orrgans are closely connected with each other. All the blood must pass through the lungs, to receive there new life and energy, by being exposed to the oxygen of the air. For this and other reasons, we will treat of these organs, here in connection. After the nutrient portion of thle food (tlhe chyle-see page 572) is discharged by the thoracic duct into the left subclavian vein, at the lower part of the neck, it is carried to the right cavity of the heart, where it mixes with a large quantity of venous blood. This mixture of fluid, as such, would not be suitable to restore the lost powers of the body, unless subjected to a process, by which the chyle is converted into blood, and the venous blood freed of its carbonic acid and water. The resfpiratory organs consist of the windc2)ipe (trachea), thie bronchia (continuations of the trac/zea), extreme points of the bronchia). il'he lungs are comp)(:;3cd of innumerable ramifications of the bronchial tubes, a;giin!4 in air-cells, lymphatic vessels, and the pulmonary their connections by cellular tissue, forms the parenchzyma of the lungs, or its substance. The lungs are divided into two large parts, the left and right, each one of which is inclosed in a, layer of the serous sac, called theek pleura. Between the right and left lung, more to the left side, lies the heart, separated fiom either by a serous membrane. Fig. 10. ll Fig. 10.

The trachea proceeds from the larynx, descending to the pit of the neck, where it divides into two parts, assuming the na me of [Page 576](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/578) 5 76, ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. Bronchia, which descend in numerous ramifications, into -he lunogs, and form altogether a surface of twenty thousand square inches, or about thirty times the surface of the human 1ody. The air-cells are small bronchial tubes, and form the ends of these ramifications, retaining the air, when once inflated, except pressed out by force. The trachea, bronchia, and air-cells are lined with the mucous membrane, and supplied with arteries, veins, and nerves. The object of respiration is to free the system of carbon and hydrogen, which accumulate in the system, and would make an end to its existence, if not removed. For its removal, an allwise Providence has used the inhaling of air, which contains oxygen, in sufficient quantity to form a combination with the carbon and hydrogen, which then is exhaled, in the form of carbonic acid and water. In this process, another wonderful provision was contained, which gives life and motion to the whole system. It is the generation of heat. The blood, in passing through the lungs, receives oxygen firom the atmosphere. The oxygen thus obtained is carried to the minute vessels, called capillaries, where it unites with the carbon and hydrogen of the decay' ing organs, as well as with the same elements furnished by the food, and thus maintains the heat throughout the entire system. The circulatory organs are the heart, arteries, veins, and capillaries. The heart, placed obliquely, in the left cavity of the chest, has the form of an inverted cone, the base of which lies upward and backward in the direction of the right shoulder and its apex points forward to the left side, about three inches, to a space between the fifth and sixth ribs; below, it rests on the tendinous part of the diaphragm. The sac, by which th(E heart is surrounded, is called pericardiurm. This is lined bJ a serous membrane, one layer of which invests the heart [Page 577](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/579) RESPIRATORY AND CIRCULATORY ORGANS. 577 Between the lining and investing layer a serous fluid is secreted, to facilitate the action of the heart. The dropsy of the heart has its seat in this place. Fig. 11. Fig. 11. A flront view of the heart. 1, Thlle right auricle of the heart. 2, The left auricle. 3, The right ventricle. 4, The left ventricle. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, The vessels through which the blood passes to / 7 anld from the heart. 2 The heart itself is a muscle, whose Ai fibres run in different directions, but mostly in a spiral direction. It is Y) i I,' divided into four distinct compartments, the right and left auricle and the rilght and left ventricle. Befo e the birth the auricles are united by an opening. After birth, this opening closes, preventing the venous blood of the right auricle from passing directly into the left. If this opening, by a fault of nature, remains unclosed, a disease ensues, called the blue disease, because the child looks bluish, on account of the venous blood of the right heart entering the circulation of the arterial blood of the left auricle. All vessels leading from the heart are called arteries; those leading to the heart, veins. Tile right heart sends a pulmonary artery, filled with venous blood, to the lungs, and the left heart receives pulnonrry veins, filled with arterial blood, from the lungs; in this case only, such an exception exists. Otherwise, all the arteries in the body carry red or arterial blood, and all veins, dark or venous blood. The venous blood, together with the chyle, is propelled through the pulmonary arteries, by the right heart into the lungs. Htere it receives the oxygen of the air, is converted into red blood, and carried by the pulmonary veins into the left heart, which sends it through the great artery, called the aorta, in innumerable divisions, into all parts of the body. 49 [Page 578](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/580) 578 ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. In this way, two systems of circulation are formed; one called the lesser or pulmtonic circulation, where the blood rushes from the right heart, through the lungs, and returns,:changed into red blood, to the left; the other, called the greater, or systemic circulation, where the blood rushes through all parts, and to the very confines of the body; and returns, changed into dark blood, to the right heart. This double circulation may be illustrated easily by the figure 8, the centel of which is the place where the heart is located. Fig. 12. Fig. 12. An ideal view of the circulation in the lungs and system. From the right ventricle of the heart (2), the dark, or venous, blood is [Page 579](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/581) RESPIRATORY AND CIRCULATORY ORGANS. 579 forced into the pulmonary artery (3), and its branches (4, 5) carry the blood to the left and right lung. In the capillary vessels (6, 6) of the lungs, the blood becomes arterial, or of a red color, and is returned to the left auricle of the heart (9) by the veins (7, 8). From the left auricle the arterial blood passes into the left ventricle (10). By a forcible contraction of the left ventricle of the heart the blood is thrown into the aorta (11), Its branches (12, 13, 13) carry it to every organ or part of the body. The divisions and subdivisions of the aorta terminate in capillary vessels, represented by 14, 14. In these hair-like vessels the blood becomes dark-colored, and is returned to the right auricle of the heart (1) by the vena cava descendens (15) and vena cava ascendens (16). The tricuspid valves (17) prevent the reflow of the blood from the right ventricle to the right auricle. The semilunar valves (18) prevent the blood passing from the pulmonary artery to the right ventricle. The mitral valves (19) prevent the reflow of blood from the left ventricle to the left auricle. The semilunar valves (20) prevent the reflow of blood fiom the aorta to the left ventricle,. The arteries, which convey the blood from the heart to every part of the system, are composed of three coats. The external or fibrous, is firm and strong; the middle or musculo-fibrous, is contractile and elastic; the internal is a thin, serous membrane, which gives the artery inside a smooth polish. Communications between arteries are numerous. The veins, which return the blood to the heart, are thinner, and more delicate in structure than the arteries. They are composed, like these, of the same three coats, but each one is more delicate and fine. The capillaries form an extremely fine network of vessels, between the ends of the arterial and the beginning of the venous system. Through these, all the blood must pass; and in this point, the capillary system resembles the fine ramifications in the parenchyma of the lungs, where the blood passes through infinitely small vessels. The p2ulse is caused by the periodical action of the heart, projecting the blood in jets. In infants, it beats in a minute more than a hundred times; in adults, about seventy times; in old persons, less than that, sometimes only sixty times. [Page 580](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/582) 580 ANATOMY AND PIIYSTOLOGY. The quantity of blood in a healthy individual varies very much; fat persons have generally less. On an average, a healthy adult has from twenty-five to thirty pounds. Fig. 18. Fig. 13.

The lymphatics are the vessels by which the process of absorption is carried on, to remove particles of useless or injurious matter. They are extremely minute at their origin, and are distributed upon the skin and other membranes as well as upon the surface and in the substance of organs. As they increase in size, they diminish in numbers. At certain points, they pass through soft bodies, called lymphatic glands, which are mostly located in the groins, armpits, on the neck, in the chest, and the abdomen. Sometimes these glands swell, producing lumps known as kernels, etc. The lacteals are vessels similar to the former, but designed to absorb the chyle from the small intestines, where they are located in great numbers. They transfer their contents to the thoracic duct, and this conveys the chyle to the left subclavian vein, at the lower part of the neck. THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. This system, by which life is distributed and sensation imparted, consists of two distinct parts, the brain, with its spinal appendix, together with all the nerves leading from these great nervous centers to all parts of the body, and the ganglionic system of nerves, called, also, the sympathetic nerve, located chiefly on each side of the spinal column, but having its principal plexuses around the abdominal organs. We give here a short anatomical synopsis of these most interesting parts of the body; requesting our readers, at the same time, to peruse larger works on this subject, if their time and inclination will permit. [Page 582](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/584) 582 ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. The brain is located within the skull-bones (cranium), and is divided into two hemispheres, the right and left. This is the case in the upper part of the brain; below, the two hemispheres are connected by a dense layel of transverse fibres, called the corpus callosumn. In the interior of the brain, there are several cavities, two of which are of considerable size, called the lateral ventricles. Water collects in these cavities, in that disease called \"Dropsy of the Brain.\" Fig. 14. Fig. 14. A vertical section of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata, showing the relation of the cranial nerves at their origin. 1. Cerebrum; 2. Cerebellum, with its arbor vitm represented; 3.

[Page 583](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/585) THE' NERVOUS SYSTEM. 583 The substance of the brain is of a pulpy character, quite soft in infancy and childhood; it gradually becomes more consistent in advanced years. It is divided into three parts, the large brain (cerebrum), the small brain (cerebellum), and the medulla oblongata, or that part of the spinal cord which lies within the skull together with tile pons Varolii. These three parts of the brain within the skull are invested and protected by the three membranes of the brain; the dura mater, a firm and fibrous membrane next to the skull; the arachnoid, a serous membrane, which envelops the brain and spine, and is like the serous membranes of the heart and lungs, a closed sac: this is the middle membrane of the three; the pia mater, a vascular membrane, composed of innumerable vessels, held together by areolar tissue; this is the nutrient membrane of the brain. From the brain issue the cranial nerves, in twelve pairs, to supply the organs of sense and motion with life and vitality. They are arranged, as regards local origin, as follows: 1. The olfactory; 2. The optic; 3. The motor oculi; 4. The patheticus; 5. The tri-facial; 6. The abducen; 7. The facial; 8. The auditory; 9. The glosso-pharyngeal; 10. The pneumogastric; l1. The spinal accessory; 12. The hypo-glossal. The spinal cold, its membranes, and the roots of the spinal nerves, are contained within the spinal column. The cord is continuous with the brain, or its lowest part, the medulla oblongata, and is divided into two lateral halves by an anterior and posterior fissure. Each of the lateral halves is divided by furrows into three distinct sets of fibres, called the ante.. rior, lateral, and posterior columns; the posterior are the, columns of sensation; the anterior, those of motion, and the lateral are divided in their functions between motion and sensation. From these divisions issue the s2pial nereves, thirty-one pairs [Page 584](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/586) 5i84 1ANATOMIY AND PHYSIOLOGY. in number, each one from two roots, an anterior and posterior, combining the functions of motion and sensation. After the two roots have united, which constitute the spinal nerve, it passes through the opening between the verteblae on the sides of the spinal column, and distributes itself to its rerespective organs in innumerable ramifications. Fig. 15. Fig. 15. The distribution of the fifth pair of nerves. 1, The i./??,,2 1 orbit for the eye; 2, The upper jaw; 3, The tongue; 4, The 5 ~ n~iecl;i s e 6e,; 6 lThe first branch of this nerve, that passes to the eye; 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, Divisions of this branch; 7, The second branch of the fifth pair of nerves distributed to the teeth of the upper jaw; 15,16, 17, 18, 19, 20, Divisions of this brnch; 8, The third branch of the fifth / pair, that passes to the tongue iand teeth of the lower jaw; 23, The division of this branch that passes to the tongue; 28, The division that is distributed to the teeth of the lower jaw. The spinal nerves are divided from the head downward, into eight cervical pairs, twelve dorsal, five lumbar, and six sacral pairs. The ganglionic system, or sylnp)a/lcetic nerve, consists of a series of lknots, ori ganglia, lying, on each side of the spinal column, united with each other by nervous thfreads. It connects itself with the l)rain and spinal nerves. Each ganglion or knot, may be considered as a distinct center, from which branches issue in four directions, some for communication with other ganglia, some for distribution. The latter accom 9_....._ [Page org'ans, and form a netorl'k around them, called plexuses, and named after the artery which they accompany; for instance, the mesenteric plexus, hepatic plexus, etc. In this way all the internal organs of the head and trunk receive branches from the sympathetic nerve, which, therefore, is considered a nerve of organic life. THE SKIN. The skin covers the exterior of the body, and appears, to the naked eye, as composed of one membrane only. By closer examination, however, it is found to consist of two distinct layers of membrane, the upper or scarf-skin (epidermis), and the real skin (cutis vera), which lies underneath the former. The upper-skin (epidermis) is thin, semi-transparent, like a fine shaving of horn; it has no nerves or blood-vessels, and is without sensation. The hair and the nails are of the same nature. The real skin, (cutis vera, or corion) consists of minute fibres, interwoven with each other to a firm, strong and flexible web. This manner of composition permits innumerable interstices or pores, which are finer or closer on the superficial part of the skin than on its lower surface. The upper surface of the skin contains blood-vessels and nerves, looks, therefore, more red or pinkish, and is sensitive; while the lower strata of the skin connects with the fibrous web, in which the subcutaneous fat of the body is deposited. Beside, the skin is supplied with nerves; lymphatics also exist in great numbers. The oil-glands are contained in some parts of the true skin, in great abundance, as on the face and nose, the head. etc.; they communicate with the surface of the skin through small tubes, which penetrate the skin, and open mostly at the roots of hairs. These (lands deserve our particular notice, as their usefulness is so great, that neglect in cultivating their healthy action is [Page 586](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/588) 58 6 ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. felt very severely. They appear in great distinction on the eyelids, where their disease causes the so-called sty; they produce in the ear-passages the so-called ear-wax: they impart oil to the hair by infusing it into the sheath of each hair. In some persons these oil-glands cannot discharge their contents on the surface of the skin, on account of some diseased state, when it becomes dry and dense, appearing in round, dark spots, produced by the presence of a minute worm. The perspiratory glands are oval-shaped, or globular balls, lying in the deeper meshes of the real skin, fiom whence they communicate with the surface through minute cylindrical tubes, called \"pores.\" The quantity of these pores is truly astonishing; they average about twenty-eight hundred in the square inch of surface; and if an ordinary sized man has twenty-five hundred square inches of surface, the whole number of pores in the skin amounts to seven millions. How important must be, therefore, the culture of the skin, as an organ for secretion and exhalation. [Page 587](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/589) 11. DOMESTIC SURGERY. OuR present age is, more than any former, one of locomotion; many persons and families are constantly thrown on the tide of travel and emigration beyond the accustomed means which a high state of civilization had provided for them in their former homes. In such unusual conditions, and under such increased liabilities to accidents dangerous to life and limb, each one has to carry within himself a world of resources and practical knowledge, ready for use at a moment's warning. The Domestic Physician, therefore, ought to include also a Domestic Surgery, which should contain for the most common accidents the most simple and effectual means of relief and cure. For this rurpose alone the author has deemed it important to add this separate treatise on accidents and their treatment. Where a surgeon is near at hand, his services should at once be procured; but when none can be had and help zmust be rendered without delay, the following rules will be found very acceptable to those placed in such unfortunate emergencies. SURGICAL APPLIANCES. a. Poultices. These are of various and frequent application, sometimes with the most relieving and beneficial result. They have either a soothing or stimulating effect; as we therefore wish the one or the other, different materials have to be chosen. To produce a soothing effect we use bread and milk, corn-meal,.faxseed or slippery elm, in fact any substance which will keep moisture (587) [Page 588](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/590) 588 DOMESTIC SURGERY. and warmrth for a long time and lies softly on the skin. Of the stimulating poultices we mention here but one, that is, the mztstacrd poultice, as this is the only one which can be applied without interfering with the action of homeoopathic medicines. The preparation of a poultice is simple and quick: mix the substance with boiling-hot water, and stir it until it becomes smooth; then spread on linen or cotton cloth, grease it slightly on the surface, and lay it on the parts affected as warm as the patient can endure it; this degree can be ascertained by putting the back of the hand on the poultice; if it can be borne there without inconvenience, the patient will generally not complain. [For maturing abscesses and boils, the bread-and-milk and flaxseed poultices are perhaps the most suitable; after their opening, however, the sliippery-elbn poultice is frequently preferred, particularly if a great deal of sloughing needs the slightly astringent or stimulating property of such a poultice. Therefore slippery elm is the best poultice in carbuncles and other deep ulcers, where its use can not be supplanted by any thing else. The size of a poultice depends upon the size of the surface which is affected; it must more than cover this; its thickness is more uniform, varying from a quarter to half an inch; as soon as it is dry or cool it should be changed. The mzslctard draft is frequently needed in pleuritic affections and rheumatic pains in other parts. This is made by mixing equal parts of mustard and corn-meal, spread on cloth and covered with a piece of fine gauze, which. comes next to the skin. The yeast poultice, like the slippery-elm, is used on ulcers which slough a great deal, and where cores and other effete masses have to be removed by degrees. In all cases where poultices are applied, the parts should be well covered, so that their full effect may be had. They ought to be changed frequently, particularly when, as in summer, they incline to get sour, which never must be permitted. [Page 589](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/591) SURGICAL APPLIANCES. 589 b. Fomentations. These partake of the nature of poultices as regards intention of use, namely, to diminish local inflammation and swelling. Their application is either warm or cold; in both cases water forms the most suitable substratum; with it we can combine medicinal tinctures such as Arnica, Calendula, etc., if we wish their effect. In contusions and bruises we use Arnica, in lacerations and cuts the (7kendula, in burns the Urtica urens tincture, etc.; in all these cases cold water has to be used (ten to twenty drops of the tincture to half a pint of water). Cloths, dipped into this mixture and slightly wrung out, are applied and frequently renewed. In using hot fomentations, either of water alone, or of hops contained in a sack and dipped into hot water, the parts, after the hot cloths are applied, have to be well covered, so as to keep moisture and warmth for a long time. The attendant should have two cloths, so that at the renewal of the one he has always one ready to put on immediately. Care should be taken, to prevent the wetting of the cloths and the bed by the application of oil-cloth. c. Plasters. These are mostly used for keeping wounds together, or are put on sores to keep the air off. For this purpose a variety of plasters are in use; the common sticking-plaster and the so-called court-plaster are perhaps the most known and used, the former for larger and deeper wounds, the latter for abrasions or slighter wounds of the skin. The Arnica plaster is very useful for sprains and chronic rheumatism, particularly in the small of the back and the chest, where it may be worn for months. d. Rollers and Bandages. Without bandages, the surgeon could not successfully practice his art; he makes use of them for various purposes. They [Page 590](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/592) 590 DOMESTIC SURGERY. should be made of stout linen or cotton sheeting; strips of four fingers' width are torn off and several of them sewed together, until the required length is attained; then they are rolled tightly together, either in one or two rolls, as the ac~.. K_ companying figure shows. In using them the operator must try to cover all parts of the limb, which shall be bandaged with an equal force, spirally and smoothly, not allowing any wrinkles. To accomplish this he has to turn over the bandage on itself in certain parts of a limb, where it is needed, until he can go on in an even spiral again, all the time letting each turn cover half of the former. The illustration will show how to bandage a leg. In bandaging an arm or a leg, commence with the fingers or toes and work upward, as stated. The bandage must not be put on too tight, as this would stop the circulation of the blood, which might produce mortification. If too tight, the bandage must be unrolled and re-adjusted. In fractures of bones, the bandage is saturated from time to time with the Arnica lotion, to facilitate the cure. In many cases bandages must be made wider than four fingers, for instance, /1 _ A in fractures of ribs, where the bandage necessarily should reach from the arm-pit to the end of the small ribs; in other cases, particularly of children, the bandage must be made smaller than four fingers. The T. bandage is suitable to fasten coverings of the head or abdomen; it is easily made and applied. [Page 591](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/593) ACCIDENTS- REMOVAL OF PERSONS INJURED. 591 e. Splints. These are made of thin pine wood, or strong paste-board of suitable width and length, to be adjusted on a broken limb after it has been set, and there to be fastened either by straps or rollers. They keep the broken ends in position, and prevent them from separating. Their use will be especially referred to in the treatment of fractures. ACCIDENTS. The injuries from falls and blows, if not at once fatal, may consist in bruises, either external or internal with more or less hemorrhage, in wounds, contusions and concussions, in sprains and dislocations of joints and finally in fractures of bones. We refer the reader to the general remarks made in Chapter II., under the head of \" CASUAL DISEASES,\" which are introductory to the special treatment of casualties contained in this chapter. REMOVAL OF PERSONS INJURED BY ACCIDENT. If a person who has been injured, is unable to move or can not walk home, his injuries must be of a serious nature, and it is our duty not to increase his sufferings or dangers by injudiciously handling him on his removal. For this purpose suitable litters are furnished in large cities where hospitals are located. When these are not to be found, a litter can easily be constructed on the spur of the moment out of four stout poles, to which is attached either a sacking bottom, or over which boards are laid, covered with straw or bedding. The annexed figure will explain itself. This mode of carrying a patient is preferable to removing him in a carriage drawn by hlorses, as the jolting over rough pavements is thus avoided. [Page 592](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/594) 592 DOMESTIC SURGERY. FRACTURES OE' BONTES.V Heretofore it was believed, even by the profession, that broken bones must be set as soon after the accident as possible, and this belief is still prevalent among the people at large. Modern investigation, however, has shown that it is better to adjust the broken parts after the primary inflammation has subsided, which lasts from three to four days. \"Broken limbs\" says Dr. South, \"should not be set, as it is called, that is, bound up with roller, splints, and pads, for the first three or four days, as for some hours after the accident the part continues swelling; if bandaged up tightly while this is going on, much unnecessary pain is produced, and if the bandages be not slackened, mortification may follow, which I have known to occur. It is best then, at first, only to lay the broken bone in as comfortable a posture as possible, and nearly as can be in its natural direction; and it may be lightly bound to a single splint, merely for the purpose of keeping it steady. The arm, whether broken above or below the elbow, will lie most comfortably half bent upon a pillow. The thigh or leg will rest most easily upon the outer side with the knee bent. Broken ribs and broken collar-bones are an exception to the general rule, and require immediate attention.\" FRACTURE OF THIE NOSE. This is easily perceived by the deformity of the parts; in adjusting the nasal bones introduce a silver or wooden pencil into the inside of the nose and push out the depressed bones, while the fingers on the outside support and keep them in their places. Apply cold Arnica lotion for several days until inflammation has ceased. FRACTURE OF THE LOWER JAW. This is a fracture of more serious consequence and of frequent complications, such as luxation of one of the condyles, lacera0 For general remarks see page 81,. [Page 593](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/595) FRACTURE OF COLLAR-BONE. 593 tion of soft parts and loosening of teeth. The dislocation of a condlyle has to be first reduced (see page 603); then the loosened teeth have to be arranged in their proper places, and finally the fracture may thus be set: Bring the broken ends together and after adjusting them secure their position by closely shutting the mouth and keeping it shut. Then pass over the chin from ear to ear a stout piece of cloth, India rubber or calfskin leather, previously covered over with sticking plaster. To secure this in its place put over it a split bandage in the manner shown in the illustration. This banlage must be eight inches wide, split at each end; its front tails are passed up to behind the crown of the head, and its back tails up in front of the crown of the head. The crossings of the bandage have to be well stitched together. The patient has to subsist on liquid food and drink, which he sips through the openings of the teeth. This may last for a month or six weeks. Wet the bandage with Arnoica lotiona for the first three or five days. FRACTURE OF COLLAR-BONE. This is of frequent occurrence and requires immediate adjustment, which is easily accomplished, but from the difficulty of keeping the broken parts together by bandages, deformities frequently will remain, sometimes even a drooping of the shoulder on the affected side. This fracture is easily recognized by the shoulder of the sick side being considerably lower than the other; on examining the collar-bone itself, by passing the fingers along its edge, a gap in the bone will be found, and on moving the shoulder backward, crepitation or a grating sound will be perceived. The setting is easily effected. 50 [Page 594](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/596) 594 DOMESTIC SURGERY. Before this is done however, have the following articles ready for use: First, a pad, made of linen or cotton cloth, three inches thick on one end and one inch thick on the other. Secondly, a roller or bandage four fingers wide and four yards long. Thirdly, a piece of linen rag two by four inches, well covered on one side with mutton tallow. Finally, thread, needle and scissors, to be near when needed. After this is done, place the patient in front of you, with his back toward you, and taking hold of his two shoulders press them. backward toward you, let them be held there by another; then taking hold of the elbow of the sick arm, elevate it to the hight, even a little above the other shoulder; then adjust the ends of the broken collar-bone, at the samte time removing from the body the upper arm far enough to slip under the arm-pit, first the greased linen rag, with the greased side close in the pit, under this the pad, with the thickest part in the pit; on this pad now press the upper arm, firmly elevating and supporting the elbow all the time. Then turn the bandage once or twice around the arm and body, fasten the pad to these turns of the bandage, and keeping the forearm in a right angle over the (~,.~j[~[ rC~?, breast, envelop this by the turns of the bandage, carrying the roller J~',,,'~ from under the elbow over the sound shoulder several times. (See illustration.) The various turns of the bandage then have to be fastened by stitches to each other, wherever needed; on the Arnr ica lotion, has to be put and kept wet from time to time. Over the whole put a sling, supporting the elbow and fastened on the sound shoulder. (See illustration.) In children the cure of this fracture lasts from a fortnight to three weeks, in [Page 595](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/597) RoX-E~ nRIS. 595 older persons a month. if the bandages get loose or deranged, they have to be re-adjusted. In bed the patient should recline on the sound side, rather elevated. The wound fever is slight; if it is not, however, give Aconite and Arolica alte-rnately, a few doses. Diet must be light and not stimulating. The fracture of one or more ribs is to be presumed to exist, if, after a fall or blow, the patient feels at every breath a stitch in the injured side, and if a slight cracking is heard or felt by the hand, placed flatly on the injured part, while the patient draws in av long breath. Keep the patient as quiet as possible and put a tight bandage around his chest, reaching from the arma-pits to the short ribs; before this is tightened and fastened, lay over the broken parts a compress wet in Arnmica lotion, which afterward is kept wet through the bandage. Inwardly give Arn'ica and Aconite in alternate doses (six globules every hour or two hours). The patient should rather lie in an elevated position, particularly in a day or two after the accident. If the bandage gets loose, it has to be adjusted again. If the ribs be broken on both sides, or if the breast-bone is fractured, no bandage must be applied, but only a compress, wet with Arnica lotion, laid on the injured parts and the patient be kept perfectly quiet. FRACTURE OF ARMI ABOVE THE ELBOW. (I-3UMERUS.) The most frequent fracture of the humerus occurs in its middle portions; seldom above near the shoulder, or below near the elbow. It is always easily detected; the patient being incapable of raising either the elbow or fore-arm; crepitation is heard on slightly rotating the arm. If the arm is very much swollen, keep it for a day or two, slightly bent on a pillow, without setting it, but bathe it constantly with the cold Arnica lotion until the swelling subsides. [Page 596](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/598) 596 DOMESTIC SURGERY.'i\"hen adjust the parts by extending the arm sufficiently to make length and positions agree with the sound one, the forearmn being always at a right angle. Then bandage the arm fromn the fingers upward to the arm-pit; there stop the roller and lay on the four sides of the upper arm four well padded splints. (See illustration.) These splints reach not further than the elbow, and are fastened by the roller which now is turned from the shoulder down to the elbow and back again to the shoulder, where it is sewed fast. Then wet the bandages with AAr ica lotion, put a sling under the arm and around the neck, which must not reach further than half the fore-arm. If the bandage gets loose in a few days, put another one over the old one, or readjust anew. In about a month the broken parts have united. FRACTURE OF THE FORE-ARM. If both bones are broken the fracture is easily discovered. \"But,\" says Dr. South,> \" if only one be broken, it is not so easy for an unpracticed person to distinguish it; but this is of less consequence, as the sound bone serves for a splint to keep the broken one pretty nearly in its place, even though no splints be put on.\" If swollen, bathe the arm in cold Arnica lotion until the swelling has disappeared. If both bones be broken, two padded splints are required, extending from the tips of the fingers to the bend of the elbow in front, and to the point of the elbow behind. The fore-arm is now to be bent on the elbow; the splints applied, one before and the other behind, and both bound firmly to the arm with a roller from the fingers up to the bend of the elbow. The arm then resting on its back is to be put in a sling, which shall \" Dr. John F. South's Household Surgery. [Page 597](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/599) BROKEN FINGERS-THIGH. 597 support it from the elbow to the finger ends. The splints must be kept on about a month. BROKEN FINGERS. If the first or second joint of either of the fingers be broken, it is readily discovered; but not so easily if it be the third joint, which, however, is but rarely broken without more serious mischief. If swollen, bathe the fingers in Arnica lotion. until the swelling has disappeared. A piece of thin wood or stiff pasteboard, as wide and as long as the finger, is to be placed on its front or same side as the palmn of the hand. Upon this the finger being laid straight, it is to be bound with a roller an inch wide from end to end. It is best to keep the hand in a sling for three weeks or a month, and not to attempt using it till after that time. The broken finger often remains stiff a long while after it has become well knit together; it is therefore a good plan to render the joints supple by thrusting the hand for half an hour daily into warm grains, but, if these can not be procured, soaking it for the same time in warm water; and afterward to bend the finger gently forward and backward, as far as it can be moved without pain. BROKEN THIGH. If this accident occur in any part a little distant from the hip or knee-joint, it is easily ascertained from the unnatural bending at the seat of injury and by the person being unable to lift up the leg below the broken part, as well as by his not liking to attempt it on account of the pain produced by the ends of the bone pushing into the flesh. For the first day or two, bath the patient's thigh with Arnica lotion, and begin to set the fracture on the third day. Though a much more serious accident than either of those already mentioned, it may be managed quite as easily, and in [Page 598](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/600) 598 DOMESTIC SURGERY. many cases, if the person will be quiet, without any splints, although it is better to use them. WITHOUT SPLINTS.-The patient must be placed upon his back upon a firm mattress, laid on a board S%- resting on the bed-frame, which is better 9 2 than on the sacking, as that sinks with the weight of the body when resting on it for some weeks. Two thick pads are to be / made, of sufficient size to cover, the one the whole of the inside of the sound knee, and the other the inside of the ankle of the same limb. Both limbs must now be laid close together, in the same straight line as the body, resting on the heels, with the toes right upward; and in doing this care must be taken that the calves of the legs rest fiat on the mattress. Thus far done, the body must be kept immovable by one person, who \\ 80 8grasps the hips with his two hands. A second person then takes hold of the broken limb with both hands, just above the ankle, and gently and steadily draws it down without disturbing its position, while a third places the knee-pad between the two knees, and the ankle-pad between the ankles. The gentle pulling being continued, the sound knee is brought close to that of the broken limb, but a little above it, so that it rests against the jutting inside of the joint, and then, both being kept close together, a pad about as broad as the hand must be turned round both legs, directly below both knees, and around this a roller about three yards long must be tenderly, carefully, and tightly wound, so as to prevent one knee slipping from the other. A strap and buckle will serve the same purpose; or, in want of roller and strap, a handkerchief may be passed twice round and tied, care being taken not to make the knot [Page 599](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/601) FRACTURE OF LEG BELOW THE KNEE. 599 opposite either of the hard parts which mark the place of the two leg-bones; for if put there it will be liable to cause very uneasy pressure. Both ankles are next to be tied together in like manner, care being taken that that of the sound is above that of the broken limb. A small pad is now to be put between the insides of both feet to guard them against the pressure which is made by binding the feet together, and this completes the whole business. This method, simple as it is, is a very good one, and as good cures have followed as under the usual and more complicated mode of treatment. FRACTU-iE OF THE BONES OF THE L~EG BELOW THE KNEE. (TIBIA AND FIBULA.) Experience proves, says Dr. Epps,\" that both the bones are more frequently broken together than singly. Great care must be taken that the end of the tibia is not pushed through the skin. SYMPTOMS.- Not being able to walk or bear upon the leg; mobility of the fractured pieces; a distinct crepitus (noise); and a change in the direction and the shape of the limb. While the swelling lasts, the limb should be rested on a pillow, applying Arnica lotion, etc. After the swellN M ing has subsided, which takes from three to six days, the fracture should be set. Two splints are required, one for the outer side with a hole for the ankle, and one for the inside; both to be well padded, especially at the ends. The leg is to be placed as represented in the cut, with the knee a little bent;: Dr. George N. Epps' Treatise on Accidents, in the British edition of Pulte's Homeopathic Domestic Physician. [Page 600](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/602) 600 DOMESTIC SURGERY. the leg is carefully lifted sufliciently high to allow the outside splint being placed under it; and the other splint is then placed on the inside, due attention being directed to the holes for the ankle-bones, and that the great toe is in a line with the inner edge of the knee-cap. A roller is then applied, commencing at the foot, bandaging up to nearly the fractured part; a second roller is applied, commencing just above the fractured bone up to the knee; again see that the fractured bones are in position; then a third roller (or the remainder of the first), is bandaged over the fractured part. A pillow is placed on the outside to raise the limb a little. The advantage of thus applying the bandages being, that the middle or last roller can be removed without disturbing the limb or splints to examine the fractured ends of the bones. The foot must be kept steady with the leg. FRACTURE OF THE SHIN-BONE ONLY. (iTibia.) This fracture very seldom happens without the fracture of the lesser bone also (fibula); but should it happen, it is to be put up in like manner to a fracture of both bones. FRACTURE OF TH:E LESSER BONE ONLY. (Fibula.) The only evidence, generally, of fracture of this bone, is pain when the patient puts his foot to the ground. All that is required is rest, by keeping it upon the bed, and apply the Arnica, etc., lotion. FRACTURE OF THE FOOT AND TOES. Severe contusions and lacerations accompany, more or less, injuries of this kind, which require a preparatory treatment by externally applying the Arnica and Ca ledula lotion, before any reposition of the bones thus crushed or broken dare take place. The foot has to be kept in a horizontal position, wrapped in a compress wet with the above named lotions; if more lacerated take Calenduact, if more contused take A;rxlica [Page 601](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/603) COMPOUND FRACTURES-DISLOCATION. 601 tincture. When swelling and inflammation have subsided, adjustment must take place, and the broken parts kept in position by strong pasteboard splints and bandages. COMPOUND FRACTURES. These are attended by an external wound or protrusion of the broken bone through the skin; on this account they are of the most dangerous character, particularly on the lower limbs, as the amount of force necessary to produce such an injury must have been very great, and acting perpendicularly must have jarred the whole frame, consequently produced internal in. juries. Their treatment as to setting and treating the broken parts does not differ from that of a simple fracture; but the bandages and other apparatus must be so arranged as to permit afterward the dressing of the wound without risking a new displacement of the bone. The same should be done in comminuted fractures, where the bone is crushed and splinters of the bone have to separate and subsequently to be removed when loosened, through the external wound. DISLOCATION OR LUXATION. The joints of the body are formed by the junction of the ends of two bones, fastened and surrounded by ligaments and acted upon by muscles for purposes of motion and exertion of power. According to the requirements of use, they are formed and fashioned differently. Dislocation takes place, when by external violence or natural weakness of the ligaments, the end of one bone is displaced from the other and kept in that position for a length of time. We extract here from Dr. George N. Epps on \"Accidents.\" \" Joints are divided into ball and socket (orbicular), having a rotatory motion, as in the articulations of the shoulder, hip, and thumb-and angular, or pump-handle (ginglynzoid), as in the articulation of the elbow, knee, etc. The ball and socket joints have the greater diversity of 51 [Page 602](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/604) 602 DOMESTIC SURGERY. motion, and also have the greater liability of being diSlc,u4ed, but, fortunately, are the most easily put in their place. The sooner a dislocation is reduced, the easier it can be accomplished; the longer a dislocation remains unre2duicd, the more difficult, and in some cases, the reduction will have become impossible. In consequence of the muscles being the chief cause of resistance in the reduction of dislocations at the time of receiving the injury, should the patient be suffering from faintness, weakness, sickness, intoxication, paralysis, etc., thus preventing the exercising of his strength, the less will be the difficulty in effecting the reduction. Dislocations are attended with more or less laceration or tearing, or lengthening of the soft parts immediately surrounding the joint, more especially the membrane investing the joint; it may re-slip from its socket after the reduction, to prevent which, the parts must be kept perfectly quiet. It is essential after the reduction of a dislocation of the shoulder or the jaw, that a bandage should be applied to retain them in position, giving the parts rest for a time to become strong. Dislocations are divided, as in cases of fractures, into simple and compound: simple when the skin is not broken; compound, when the skin is broken. The difference in regard to the termination is immense, the simple being trivial; but the compound is frequently accompanied with peril, too generally rendering amputation necessary, and in too many instances terminates fatally. The aged are less liable to dislocations, but they are more liable to fractures. Where a patient receives a fracture, and at the same time a dislocation, the dislocation is to be reduced before the frac. ture is attended to. The reduction of a dislocation should be accomplished by a gradual, continuous, extending force. It is known by the limb recovering its natural length, shape, and direction, being [Page 603](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/605) DISLOCATION -OF THE NECK. 603 able to perform certain motions which are not possible while the bone is out of its place. The patient experiences a great and sudden diminution of pain upon the reduction. The head of the bone of the shoulder-joint and of the hip-joint make a snapping noise at the moment of returning into the cavity of the joint. DISLOCATION OF THE JAW. Luxation of the jaw can occur only forward; one or both sides may be dislocated. If only one side, the chin is twisted, the motions are partial, and the mouth is a little open. When both sides are dislocated, the fixed, open state of the mouth, and projection of the chin; leave no doubt even upon the most inexperienced person of the character of the accident. The reduction of this dislocation is very simple; having guarded the thumbs with thick gloves, or other coverings, place them on the lower grinders, one on each side, the fingers clasping the lower jaw near the chin; then by pressing down the thumbs on the lower grinders, and, at the same time, raising the chin with your fingers, the articulating parts (processes) of the jaw are drawn downward, and immediately return into their natural places; a split bandage is then applied as in fractured jaw (page 592), and retained for three or four days. Should you be fearful of your thumbs being bitten, place the patient on his back, and introduce between the grinders on each side, instead of your thumbs, a piece of cork. DISLOCATION OF THE NECK. Complete dislocation of the bones (vertebrae) of the neck can not take place without being followed by instant death; but subluxation, that is, partial dislocation, may. Place your knees (if you have not an assistant on the spot) against the shoulders of the patient, and apply gentle extension with one hand under the chin, and with the other hand to the back of the head; the patient being placed on his back. [Page 604](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/606) 604 DOMIESTIC SURGERY. DISLOCATION OF THE SHOULDER-JOINT. The luxation of the shoulder-joint is the most frequent of the various dislocations. Of the several dislocations of this joint, that which generally happens is into the arm-pit. SYMPTOMS.-The arm can not move without the shoulder (scapula or blade-bone) moving with it. The natural roundness of the shoulder is gone. The patient can not use the arm. The elbow is separated from the side. REDUCTION OR TREATMENT.-There are four or five modes of reducing or \"1 putting in \" this dislocation, but that presented in the accompanying woodcut, perhaps, is the most easily managed by the reader. The sufferer is placed either on the bed or floor, with a pillow under his head. The operator having removed his boot from his left foot (assuming the patient's left arm is dislocated) places the heel with a pad between the arm and the body of the patient; he then takes hold of the patient above the wrist with his hands (or having previously passsed three turns of a wet roller round the arm, just above the elbow, and over it a jack-towel), gr'adually extends the [Page 605](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/607) LUXATION AT THE WRIST, ETC 605 limb, pushing with his heel toward the shoulder, but giving (after having kept up the extension a short time) the inclination with the foot outward. It will greatly reduce the amount of extension required, at the time of pulling, by directing the patient's attention to some other object, such as raising his feet, etc. It generally returns to its socket with a snap. When the dislocation is reduced, bandage the arm and fore-arm (the fore-arm being at a right angle with the arm) to the body by a few turns of a broad roller, supporting the arm in a sling while any swelling of the joint continues, and apply Arnica lotion, etc. LUXATIONS AT THE WRIST, JOINTS OF THE HIAND, ETC.' The wrist joint is liable to several displacements. Both radius and ulna may be dislocated together, either forward or backward, or each of them may be separately displaced in either direction-thus making six varieties of luxation. If both bones are displaced forward, this projection of the bones of the arm under the carpus or forward, happens from falling upon the palm of the hand, the ends of the radius and alna bearing with great force against the annular ligament, while, unprotected by the carpal bones, they being bent backwards. On the contrary, the displacement -at the back of the wrist takes place when a person falls on the back of the hand, so that the arm bones may be similarly thrust over the carpus, while the carpal bones are thrown forward and upward under the flexor tendons, in front of the fore-arm. - See the excellent work on Surgery, by Drs. Hill and Hunt. [Page 606](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/608) 606 DOMESTIC SURGERY. The distinctive symptoms are indicated in this account of the nature of the accidents. In the former case there will be a manifest protuberance on the front of the wrist, with a somewhat similar but smaller one at the back of the wrist, produced by the carpal bones. The hand is bent back out of the line of the fore-arm. In the latter case-the luxation backwacrd or to the back of the wrist (represented by the figure)-the symptoms are exactly reversed. There being projections both behind and before in either case, can never occasion their being confounded. The direction of the edges or ends of the projections, as well as of the hand, will immediately show the nature of the case. Strains of the wrist, produced by falls and other violence, may occasionally simulate dislocation. This may be distinguished by the fact of the questionable symptoms coming on gradually, and not showing themselves immediately after the accident, as in actual dislocation. There will also be more flexibility of the hand; nor will the swelling be likely to imitate accurately the separated extremities of the arm and carpal bones. The reduction is similar in both cases. The surgeon takes hold of the patient's hand in one of his, while the fore-arm is supported by his other hand. An assistant meanwhile holds the arm at the elbow, keeping that joint slightly flexed. As soon as sufficient force is applied in the different directions, the natural action of the muscles throws the bones into their proper place. As soon as the reduction is effected, compresses should be placed upon the wrist and secured by a roller, the part being kept constantly wet with cold dilution of Arnica water, etc. The roller should enclose the whole hand, commencing from the end of the fingers and be continued, moderately tight, up to the elbow. A splint should afterward be added, and the forearm suspended in a sling. If the parts are very painful, give internally Aconite and Rhus.

This may occur in various directions, outward, inward, forward, and (very rarely) backward. There are generally complications.. An'~~~~~.A The dislocation inward is the most common. A tumor is caused by the internal malleolus pressing so firmly against the skin as almost to burst through. The foot is turned out, but the joint is still movable. The fibula is often fractured. To reduce, let an assistant take hold of the foot by the heel and toes, flexing the leg at a right angle with the thigh, andwhile the thigh is held fast by another assistant just above the knee-make extension at the ankle, the surgeon at the same time pushing the end of the tibia back to its place. Then fix it with splints and bandages, and keep it wet with cold dilution of Arnica Tr., to subdue or prevent inflammation. [Page 608](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/610) 608 DOMESTIC SURGERY. SEPARATE DISLOCATION AT THE WRIST. Of the radius alone (the ulna adhering by its ligamentous attachment):-the external or thumb side of the hand is twisted backward and the opposite side inward or forward. The extremity of the radius may be felt and generally seen also, forming a prominence in the front of the wrist, its styloid process being removed from its station opposite the trapezium. The same treatment is required for reduction and dressing as in the complete dislocation, that is, displacement of both bones together. The ulna alone is oftener dislocated, or rather detached from the carpus (it forming no part of the wrist joint) than the radius alone. The accident is always accompanied with rupture of the ligament. The ulna generally projects at the back of the hand. The hand is twisted. The bone may be easily pressed down from where it appears on the back of the wrist, but will not stay in place. When the pressure is taken off, the deformity is renewed, the muscles drawing it up, the ligaments that should keep it down being torn away. The accident is always to be ascertained by the projection of the ulna above a level with the cuneiform bone, and the change in the position of its styloid process, which is thrown out of its proper line with the metacarpal bone of the little finger. To accomplish the reduction, all that is required to be done is simply to place the ulna down in its proper cavity at the side of the radius, and retain it there by suitable compresses and splints. The latter should extend along the fore-arm in a line with the back of the hand. They should be well padded and then secured by a roller.!~ ~ [Page 609](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/611) !II. HYGIENE AND HYDROPATHY. HIYG-IENE. fygiene comprises the knowledge of instituting such a mIode of living as is best calculated to preserve health. The clearer this knowledge is, and the closer we follow the rules of health, the surer the prevention of diseases will be. It is certain, beyond doubt, that less misery, disease, and death, would mar the happiness of this fair world, if its inhabitants would live more in accordance with the. laws of nature, and less after their own often mistaken notions and passions. Reform, in this respect, has already commenced; and, with a more rational method of healing, and the application of a more efficient and salutlary tonic agent (the water), invalid and enfeebled mankind can look forward to a happier, because a healthier future. In the following pages, we will notice briefly the most important subjects affecting the physical well-being of an individual. These are: food and drink, sleep, air, and exercise, clothing and occupcation. In all our wishes and necessities of physical and mental things, we must never forget two important principles: first, to inquire whether they are really beneficial or useful, and if so, to use them in moderation.' PA For more minute details on this subject, see Dr Tarbell's Sou.frces of I-eaith (609) [Page 610](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/612) f6 L HYGIENE AND HYDROPATHY. FOOD AND DRINK. The waste of bodily strength must be supplied by suitable food and driink. This is the greatest necessity of nature' and if errors are committed in this respect, our injured system mIust suffer the bad consequences. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance to pay particular regard to the selection of our daily food and drink, in order to escape disease, and often premature death. Suitable food must have two paramount qualities: it must be nutritious and digestible. Not all nutritious food is digestible, and vice versa. A great many experiments have been made, to test the relative digestibility of food, and from these and the experiments on the sick bed, valuable knowledge in regard to the choice of food has been collected. According to these investigations, boiled rice is the most digestible, and roasted pork, fat and lean, the most indigestible substance. In order to give the reader a more comprehensive view of the relative digestibility of food, we insert Dr. Beaumont's results, as related in Dr. Tarbell's \" Sources of Health.\" H. M.

He shlowed that.the lungs receive a greater quantity of oxygen in cold than in warm climates and seasons. A correspondingr amount of carbon, which is contained in the food, is necessary to mix with the blood, and unite in the lungs with this oxygen, to produce such a degree of animal heat, as is required by the external circumstances of the individual. The colder the climate, therefore, the more carbon (or food con [Page 613](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/615) DIGESTIBILITY OF FOOD. 618 taining carbon) is necessary, to produce animal heat; the warmer the season or climate, the less of it is necessary. For this reason, is fish-oil the staff of life for the Greenlander; because it contains the greatest amount of carbon, for producing a great quantity of animal heat, which he needs in those regions; while persons under the equator live principally upon watery, vegetable productions, affording but little support to animal heat; as nature supplies this by the hot climate itself. Animal food, in general, is more nutritious than vegetable; but the structure of our digestive organs, from the teeth to the lowest part of the intestines, shows conclusively that man was destined to partake of both kinds, animal as well as vegetable. The latter must preponderate, however, on account of the reasons above given, in warm seasons and climates, while the animal food takes precedence in cold regions and seasons: in the highest latitudes, even to the exclusion of all vegetable diet. In temperate regions, a judicious combination of both kinds of food is necessary to sustain life harmoniously. The digestibility of food varies according to individual strength and habit. Pork may be completely indigestible to the invalid and student, although it is highly nutritious, while it is perfectly digestible for the woodcutter and hunter in wild regions. Animal contains, gelatine, nutritious. Albumen is nutritious, but becomes indigestible when hardened too much by heat. Gelatine, the substance which forms the so-called jelly, is nutritious and readily digested; but its digestibility is frequently impeded by improper ingredients mixed with it, particularly in the form of acids. Oil sustains heat but is difficult of digestion; it requires the action of bile in the intestines to assimilate it properly. [Page 614](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/616) 614 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATHY. Casseine is both nutritious and digestible. It is contained in the cheesy part of milk. Osmazome is that substance which imparts flavor to the meat and the soups. Its presence shows the nutritious and digestible quality of the meat. According to the predominance of one of the above-named substances, animal food has been divided into three classes: 1. Fibrinous class; comprising mutton, beef, pork, ducks, geese, and venison. 2. Gelatinous class; to which belong veal, lamb, young poultry, and most kinds of fish. 3. Albuminous class; containing oysters, eggs, brain, and liver, the sweetbread in calves. The digestibility of meat varies according to the mixture of oil, or osmazome; for instance, ducks and geese, although belonging to the fibrinous, or best digestible class, are more indigestible than beef; because they are of an oleaginous nature. Mitton and beef are among the most nutritious and digestible of meats. The former is rather better for invalids, dyspeptics in particular. Venison, also, is very nutritious and digestible. Pork is difficult of digestion; because it is united to so much oily or fat substance. Beside, its continual use causes diseases of the skin and lymphatic system. Veal and lamnb belong to the gelatinous class; very nutritious, but not so easily digested, because they are not sufficiently matured or ripened, as it were. Poultry differs, also, according to its age; the young containingo more gelatine, and requiring, in consequence, not so much roasting or baking; the older ones containing more fibrine, and requiring, therefore, more cooking and roas ting. Among the fowls, there are none more suitable for invalids than the wild fo.wls, such as partridges, pheasants; etc. [Page 615](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/617) DIGESTIBILITY OF FOOD. 615 Eggs and oysters, are very nutritious, and very digestible, in their natural state; but to harden their albumen, by cooking or stewing too much, renders them very objectionable for the sick. Clams are not so digestible. Fishl, in general, differ as regards their digestibility, in the same proportion as they contain more oily substance. Marine fish generally contain more oil than fresh water fish. Fish without scales contain more oil, and are, therefore, more indigestible than other fish. Vegetable food contains, principally, starch (fecula), gluten, mucilage, oil, and sugar. Starch, like oil, furnishes carbon, and abounds in the grains, in potatoes and other roots, as well as in arrowroot, sago, tapioca, etc. Gluten, the nutritious part of grain also, enables it to form a tenacious paste, by the mixture of flour with water; it is similar to-the animal fibrine. Miucilage, or gum, is innutritious, but useful, by furnishing carbon and hydrogen to the oxygen of the blood. Sugar and oil serve the same purpose. Rice is a digestible and nutritious vegetable, wholesome for healthy and debilitated persons. The potato ranks next, if roasted or baked, while it is less digestible when boiled; the sweet-potato is less digestible than potato. scago, tapioca, farina, are both digestible and nutritious. Beets contain a good deal of sugar, and on that account, furnish considercable carbon and hydrogen; but, as the fibrous part of the beet is entirely indigestible, invalids must abstain from its use. Onion, cabbage, asparagus, and tomato, contain but very little nutriment, and must. not be indulged in by persons having, or being disposed to the diseases of the abdomen. [Page 616](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/618) 616 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATHY. Fruits, in general, are refrleshing and wholesome, but not very nutritious. This latter quality makes them very desirable in diseases, where a nutritious diet otherwise would be detrimental. In the convalescence from fevers, apples, baked or roasted, dried prunes stewed, etc., form a refreshing and grateful diet for the recovering patient; in the green state, fruit produces flatulency, and must be avoided by patients, although a moderate use of ripe fruit for a well person, is very good, except in seasons when bowel complaints predo. minate. In order to enable the reader to distinguish between substances, as regards their nutritious quality, we subjoin here a list of some of those most in use, as given in Carpenter's Physiology.

How important it is, therefore, to procure an article, so indispensable and necessary, in as pure a state as possible. The best water for drink is, without doubt, rain water, as it is free fiom admixtures of earthy substances; yet, even rain-water frequently becomes impure by falling through an impure atmosphere, particularly that hanging over large towns, or by running on roofs of houses, through unclean spouts before it reaches the cistern. Equal to rain-water, in purity and taste, is the water' procured by the melting of snow and ice, if the latter has been formed in clean ponds or rivers. But where rain water cannot be obtained in sufficient quantity or purity, it is generally taken from the rivers and lakes, which furnish a better water than wells. The latter contains more or less lime, salts, or other earthy impurities, which render it neither palatable nor healthy. Water, coming from marshy regions, is entirely unfit for drinkin; at least, not until, by boiling, the inherent organic natter is destroyed. A healthy person ought to habituate himself to a free use of cold water. Beside using it externally in baths, he should drink morning, noon, and evening, with his meals, a sufficient quantity to dilute the food. But the water lie drinks must be cold, as it is this latter quality which offers to the stomach a natural and strengthening stimulus for digestion; in summer, and in southern latitudes, ice is necessary to render the water 52 [Page 618](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/620) 618 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATHY. fit for hygienic purposes. If a persor, is once used to drink plenty of cold or ice-water at or after his meals, he seldom suffers from indigestion, and needs not the use of stimulating drinks; and every one can easily habituate himself to this practice. It is a wrong idea, which seems yet to prevail to a great extent, that it is unwholesome to drink water at the meals; but experience has the advantage, and one can soon test the matter for himself. The trial must only be continued for some time, in order to allow the system to accommodate itself to the new habit. Health and good spirits will be the consequence of such a change in a person's living. It is also very proper to drink a tumbler of fresh water when retiring in the evening, or on rising in the morning. In doing this, the want of other drinks or beverages of a stimulating nature, such as coffee, or tea, is not felt so much, and can be dispensed with easier by degrees. Coffee, especially, is one of those enticing, palatable beverages which have laid the majority of the civilized world under contribution; it is made nutritious by the addition of cream and sugar; but the greatest part of its contents is medicinal, and consequently, not fit for daily consumption, without creating artificial alterations in a person's healthy condition. Hahnemann, the illustrious founder of Homceopathy, was the first who drew the attention of the coffeedrinking community to the destructive tendency their favored article had on the constitution. He distinguished well between a moderate use of this drink and an immoderate consumption in large quantities and strong decoctions. We recommend our readers to read his admirable article on this subject. It exhausts all that can be said in regard to it, and is capable to cure the most inveterate coffee-drinker. Homoeopathy forbids its use in most all diseases, and insists on a more natural diet; in this important undertaking, she is supported by the rigorous system of hydropathy, which demands tho [Page 619](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/621) DIGESTIBILITY OF FOOD. 619 abolition of all stimulating drink, and allows nothing but water. But, if coffee cannot be abstained from, or if a person is only using it moderately, without experiencing bad consequences, it would be well to recommend a good preparation of the bean, by roasting it but slightly, grinding it never long before it is used, and adding to the decoction one-half of boiled milk. In this way, coffee may be drank with comparative impunity. Tea, as a daily drink, meets with the same objections as coffee, and is only tolerated in its use for the sick, because these have not been sufficiently estranged from such stimulants to do without it. To healthy persons we would recommend to abstain from its use entirely, as tea is neither nutritious, nor capable of fostering the digestion. If any tea shall be used, let it be black tea, as this contains less of the tannin, or the astringent principle, which forms an ingredient of all kinds of teas. Chocolate, or cocoa, is decidedly preferable to coffee or tea as a daily drink, although it is, to some extent, an indigestible article, which needs good digestive powers and exercise to render it wholesome. It is frequently allowed to patients who have no abdominal diseases, or do not suffer from weakness of the stomach. Milk is very nutritious, but not always digestible. Although nature designed infants to subsist for some time on milk, it is no stronger proof, on that account, of its greater digestibility; as it is well known that an infant's stomach is not yet weakened by stimulating food or drink, and is better prepared for the digestion of milk than that of adults. The practice of drinking milk at dinner is very injurious; it is more wholesome toward evening, particularly in the summer, and in the morning, when bread-and-milk forms a good diet for healthy persons. [Page 620](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/622) 6290 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATtHY. The reason why country people can eat and drink milk with irnmpti'nity, w!ile pirsols 1'vliving - in cities dare not do same, lies sirmpl)y in tlie consalni excrcise of tlhe former, combined with less care and liasty pursuits of life. Aft'ier drinking milk, no sour articles must be drank or eaten, as an undue coagulation will ensue in the stomach, with all its morbific consequences. Buttermilk is a healthy beverage, but it must be used with care, not allowing any acids or fruits to follow after it. Spiritous liciuors, wine, brandy, etc., must be considered as medicines, never as drinks, which might be adopted for daily consumption with impunity. And, in a medicinal capacity, they are truly beneficial, while, in the other, they have proved to be the greatest curses of mankind. But enough has been said and argued on this point, and it would be useless here to repeat the proofs, that the habitual use of spiritous liquors ruins both body and soul. As medicines they are prescribed by the physician; for instance, brandy, after having eaten indigestible articles, or as a stimulus in Asiatic cholera; wine after debilitating diseases, or after great loss of blood; and ale or porter for nursing women, etc. We advise strictly to adhere to the principle, \"Touch not, taste not, handle not.\" SLEEP. This interruption of the voluntary activity of the bodily powers is as necessary for their renovation and strength as food and drink; in sleep reparation is not counteracted by waste as it is during the period of wakefulness. If we would eat and fill our blood with nourishment, yet have not sufficient bodily exercise to exhaust strength, we would soon produce a disturbance of the equilibrium, which must exist in our system between loss and supply. In the following order we should regulate the hours of life; first, work (mental and bodily exercise for every healthy individual, without excep [Page 621](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/623) SLEEP. 621 tion); second, eating (the principal meal ought to be had toward evening, after the labor is done); third, sleep (soon after eating, in order to permit the nourishment in the blood to crystallize into the different solids of the system). The time which should be passed in sleep varies according to age, occupation, and constitution. Children need more sleep than those of a maturer age, where the growing, or solidification of the system is not so much required. Vigorous, mental activity needs longer sleep to recruit than mere bodily labor; because the nervous energy, which facilitates solidification, becomes more exhausted by mental than bodily fatigue. The lymphatic constitution needs more sleep than the nervous and bilious, because the former having less nervous energy, requires longer time to convert, during the sleep, the blood into muscle, nerve, sinew, etc. There is no normal quantity of hours to repose in sleep; as a general rule, it may range from six to seven hours in twenty-four; circumstances alter these, however, frequently; every one must try to find out which number of hours will suit for him. The best time for sleep is, without doubt, from nine or ten o'clock, before midnight, until three or four o'clock in the morning. Early rising has so many advantages in point of health and happiness, that it hardly needs a further recommendation here. The place of sleep ought to be chosen from among the best in a house. The lower floors are never fit to contain bedrooms, as the confined air, during the night, in the lower part of a house, is unfit for respiration. The sleeping apartment should be the best located and the largest room in a house; an eastern and southern exposure is the best; during the day, its windows must be kept open, and the bed-clothing aired; the best surface to repose on is the hair mattress, which combines all the necessary requisites for this purpose. During the sleep, the cover ought to be sufficient; if possible, [Page 622](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/624) 622 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATIIY. let it consist of quilts, whose number is regulated as to comfort. Some persons have the erroneous idea that, to lie on the back during sleep, is the most healthy position one can assume; the most natural and healthy position is to lie on the side, the very best is the right side. But this varies as to habit, and, if so, does not signify disease. By lying on the back, the spine is pressed and heated, beyond what may be good for it. Lie with the head supported, by one pillow, slightly elevated above the rest of the body. AIR AND EXERCISE. The quality of the air which fills our lungs has the greatest influence on the healthy state of our system; as on it depends the thorough change which the blood must undergo, from the venous to the arterial. The atmospheric air consists of one-fifth. part of oxygen and nearly four-fifths nitrogen, and a small quantity of carbonic acid gas. The first, or oxygen, is the only life-sustaining fluid, while the nitrogen and carbonic acid gas, each by itself, are life-destroying; but, in the above mixture of the three, the air becomes just adapted to the wants of our physical existence. Alter this proportion in the least, and sickness and death must be the inevitable consequence. It is of the highest importance, therefore, to have the air which we breathe as nearly like that which nature has prepared for us as possible. This, however, we can only accomplish by a thorough system of ventilation, which carries of the vitiated air, and permits fresh air to enter our apartments freely. The rooms for the sick are no exception to this most necessary rule. The more air a patient can have, the sooner he will recover. The only precaution necessary in such cases, is to prevent a draught from passing over the patient. We direct the attention of our readers particularly to this subject, and invite them to make themselves acquainted with [Page 623](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/625) AIR AND EXERCISE. 623 works treating extensively on the necessity and the art of ventilation; as in many a situation in life, it will be of the utmost importance for them to carry the theories of ventilation into practical execution; for instance, in building dwellinghouses, churches, halls for meetings, etc. We would here make one remark in regard to churches, which receive their ventilation at the sides, by opening the windows at the time of meeting. This seems to me a practice fulfilling well enough its immediate object-the ventilation \u2014but doing harm in another direction, namely, creating a draught, which passes over part of the assemblage, thereby rendering their seats very uncomfortable, and dangerous for health and life. An edifice with high ceilings ought to be always ventilated from the top of the ceiling, where the heated air will sooner be found than at the side or below. In short, we would advise everybody to try always to breathe as pure and fresh air as possible; may he be in health or in sickness. Everything which has a tendency to deteriorate the air must be avoided and removed. Exhalations from marshy grounds, damp cellars, or any place where animal or vegetable decomposition is going on, are frequent sources of disease and death. Everything must be avoided which renders the air moist and damp, or prevents a free circulation all around the places where we dwell. The more air, the better; par-'icularly in childhood, where the healthy development of the system depends so much on the lively stimulus which the plentiful consumption of the oxygen gives to the energies of the system. An infant, instinctively wants to be carried in the open air, where it delights to breathe the invigorating fluid. Parents should send their children in the free, open air as often as possible; as nothing more contributes to health and a good constitution than exercise in the open air. Activity, motion, exercise, is a principal object and fundamental condition of organic life. Without it, there is no ener [Page 624](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/626) 6 24 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATHY. getic expressions of the functions of the organs, which become torpid, and act sluggishly. Without exercise, the muscle will never swell and become strong and well-formed; the joint never will become supple. Without exercise, the appetite never will be stimulated, the nerves invigorated, and the blood system put in vigorous motion. Exercise, however, brings life and energy to every part of the system. Look at the blacksmith's arm-how muscular, strong, and healthy. Bodily exercise and labor is required of every one, may he be rich or poor, learned or ignorant, to keep healthy, and become strong. It should be the particular care of parents, beside mental culture, not to neglect the bodily education of their children. The tiaining in all the arts of life must have reference to the wants and necessities of the present and future well-being of those dear ones, placed under our especial guardianship. Gymnastic exercises now form a branch of the education of our youth, and should be practiced regularly and constantly, commencing with the lighter exertions, until the severer feats can be performed with ease. Walking, and running at a moderate gait, is perhaps the best and most suitable exercise for adults, beside that exercise which the daily occupations offer. It ought to be borne in mind, however, that no severe exer(ise must be undertaken directly after meals; as a full stomach, for digestion, requires suspension of muscular activity. CLOTHING AND OCCUPATION. In no department of civilized life has the fancy of man committed so many errors, leading to destruction of health and life, as in that which relates to the external covering of the body. In choosing a garment, one must always first remember its purpose and use, before he follows the dictates of fashion. If fashion was directed more by the utility thian by the oddity and fancifulness of clothing, its reign inight be tolerated; but this is, unfortunately not the case, It is, for [Page 625](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/627) CLOTHING AND OCCUPATION. 625 instance, fashionable among ladies to wear thin-soled shoes; yet there is no greater destroyer of human life than a thinsoled shoe-not even pestilence and vice. The object of clothing the body, beside for decency, is to shield it from the heat and cold of weather. To this purpose all other considerations, as of beauty, convenience, etc., ought to yield the preference; and even healthy persons should not easily depart from a rule so imperative and necessary. Cotton, linen, and wool, manufactured into different kinds of stuff, are the articles mostly used for clothing. Linen is the best article for summer, and should not be laid aside in winter, except by persons subject to rheumatism and frequent colds. Cotton has won its way almost into universal use, and its applicability for summer and winter wear is generally admitted. Yet it is not a sufficient substitute for the woolen goods, particularly flannel, when persons liable to rheumatic attacks need, beside protection from cold, a covering which stimulates the skin to a higher degree of action, and absorbs at the same time, its perspiration. This the woolen fabrics, especially flannel, etc., do, better than any other, and are, therefore indispensable to persons of a tender skin, and to those liable to great exposure to the extremes of cold and heat. Wool is a bad conductor of caloric, and, therefore, the best calculated to retain the heat generated within the body upon the surface, as well as to protect it from external heat. The quantity of clothing must be regulated according to the seasons; but in such a manner that its change should never be in advance of the coming season, but only after it has fully set in. A change of under-clothes before June is seldom without serious consequences; while the summer dress may be retained until late in the fall and winter, without great inconvenience and detriment. Clothing must be made so that it does not incommode the body either in motion or rest. [Page 626](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/628) 626 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATHY. The human system is so admirably constructed in all its parts, that none presses or weighs heavily upon the other; and in this way, only, the perfect harmony and healthy condition of all its functions is rendered possible; for the same reason, howyever, does it not permit any external pressure, by clothing, etc., without serious injury. If the boots or shoes are too tight, painful corns appear, and imbitter the hours of the sufferer; if the waist is laced too tight, lung complaints are its fearful and destructive consequences. It would be unnecessary to enlarge upon this subject; it is known too well by every one, at the present time. In general, keep the head and breast coo]; the feet and stomach, however, warm. If the dress has become wet, hasten to change it. Be not careless in this respect; as frequently negligence in undressing, after having become wet, has been the cause of lingering diseases, or even death; particularly the feet require our whole attention in this respect. Young girls, at the age of change, must be especially watched well as regards the protection for their feet and abdomen. After violent exercise, we must cool off by degrees, covering ourselves more, as we become cooler. The occupation of a person has a great and increasing effect on his health, mentally as well as bodily. That this is undoubtedly the case, has been clearly proved by the statistical tables, carefully made for the purpose of showing the relative longevity of persons pursuing different avocations of life. The following statistical table, made at Berlin, in 1834, and taken from Dr. Tarbell's \" Sources of Health,\" is very instructive in this respect: Of 100 Clergymen, attained the age of 70 years and upward,..... 42 d' i' Farmers,.40 -\" k' Commercial men,.. o * 35 [Page 627](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/629) HYDROPATHY. 627 Of 100 Military men, attained the age of 70 years and upward, 33 \" \" Lawyers,......... 29. Artists......... 28 \"t Teachers......... 27 \" \" Physicians.......... 24 it is evident, from the above, that the quiet pursuits of life, which require a constant and certain amount of mental and corporeal activity, of not too exciting a character, such as the professional labors of a minister of the Gospel, or the occupation of a farmer, are the most favorable to the attainment of a high age; while the physician, the very opposite of these two, as regards regularity and uniformity of action, is the lowest in the scale of his years of life. There is no doubt that the above table is correct; and if so, it teaches volumes to every one who has either already chosen a pursuit of life, or who has yet to do it. The former must adhere the more to the strictest rules of health, if he has chosen a less favorable profession; the latter may benefit himself infinitely by selecting the more healthy pursuit of life, if he has to choose between two. A greater sense of duty, and a lesser degree of unchecked ambition, might have saved many a valuable life from an early grave. It is our duty to live as long and as usefully as possible. HYDROPATHY. IIydropathy is the name for a method of curing diseases by the application of cold water, in various ways, internally and externally, as circumstances may require. Although the advantage of cold water in disease was known in the earlier times, yet its systematic use for that purpose was never looked upon as an essential part of the healing art, and, therefore, no decided results were elicited. To Prissnitz, a simple farmer in Germany, belongs the honor of having first boldly [Page 628](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/630) 628 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATHY. proclaimed, and sustained by facts, the high qualities of cold water, as a remedy for diseases. And so rapid was the progress of this new and startling doctrine, that while its propounder was still enjoying his fame and fortune, his discovery had already been adopted in almost every part of the world. The appearance of Hydropathy, as an auxiliary branch of medicine and hygiene, seems to have been providential in our time; as it was never before more need:ed, and never would have been appreciated as much. Our generation, so weakened, physically and morally, by a thousand influences which we could hardly enumerate here, needed, with the change of medicine which was consummated in the discovery and cultivation of Homceopathy, a system of dietetic rules and strengthening appliances, which should be as much according to nature as those formerly prescribed had been against nature. In this hygienic or preventive feature of the cold water lies one of its greatest blessings; another one, however, presents itself in its healing powers, for a number of diseases. Although its healing effects are wonderful, and entitled to all consideration and praise, yet its universal application, as the only curative agent, superseding direct medication, is impossible; because its principle is more negative in its effects upon disease in general. The cold water, in strengthening the powers of nature, prepares them to throw off disease, or, in other words, to produce a crisis, which enables nature, in a struggle with the disease, to throw it off. This principle of Hydropathy is true in chronic as well as acute diseases; but in the latter, its application is more limited, and this in proportion to the acuteness and severity of the diseases. To treat Asiatic cholera, for instance, or cholera infantum, with cold water alone, might be, to say the least, a questionable and hazardous undertaking. Neither would it be necessary or right to trust, in the thousands of medical cases, to one healing agent alone, which at best only assists in keeping up [Page 629](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/631) HYIDROPATHY. 629 sinking nature, when we have the knowledge of other agents which have a direct annihilating effect upon the disease itself. And this is Homceopathy, whose application in diseases does not prevent the use of cold water; but, in most cases, prescribes its use, to strengthen nature, that the remedies may destroy the disease in a direct or specific manner. These zcvo systems, properly combined and practiced together, will,orm the most complete code of medical rule and action which has existed, as yet. Allopathy and Hydropathy can never act together; because the principle of the former, to break down the natural strength, is too antagonistic to the objects of the latter, which tries to elevate, and not to destroy the strength of nature. There is no other alliance left, neither could any other be conceived, as natural, harmonious, and effective as that of Horhceopathy and Hydropathy, each one supporting and strengthening the doings of the other. Providence was evidently at work in permitting the former to be discovered by the most learned and philosophic mind of the age, the illustrious Hahnemann; and the latter to be practiced first by an unlearned, but unsophisticated peasant; the first being the result of deep reasoning and research in matters of nature, the latter of simple and clear observation. The power of this double lesson, given to the medical world almost at the same time, was too overwhelming not to arouse it from perversion and affectation. Hahnemann at first broke down, with a giant's strength, the learned fetters which for ages had encompassed the best minds among the medical profession. He opened and showed the true way; a new era had begun, and men, liberated from old prejudices, were willing to try anything offered with some degree of plausibility, reserving for themselves the final judgment. After such changes were wrought in the mode of thinking, it was possible that Mesmer could succeed and find followers, and that Oertel and Prissnitz could draw the attention of sufferers to the remedial powers of water. [Page 630](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/632) 630 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATHY. The pretensions of Hydropathy to constitute a perfect medical system, in which light some of its most modern practitioners have tried to establish it, must and will be abandoned, as they have neither a theoretical basis nor practical demonstration. In fact, efforts of this kind, if persisted in obstinately, must finally result in detriment to the good cause itself, diminishing the reputation of the cold water, in those spheres where its application is deservedly of the greatest benefit. And this range of action is by no means so small or so inferior as to make the exclusive friends of Hydropathy seek for a larger dominion, even beyond the reach of its principle or easy application. It needs but a slight acquaintance with the workings of Homceopathy, in comparison with Hydropathy, to come to the conclusion that the former could sooner dispense with the assistance of the latter, than vice versa, but that a judicious union of both insures the most blessed results. In a great many cases, the cold water may be applied alone, without giving any medicines. This is particularly the case in those chronic forms of diseases, which have been treated or produced by allopathic medicines; such as chronic rheumatism and gout, syphilis, mercurial diseases, dyspepsias, chronic diarrheas, constipation, etc. But even in such cases a recourse to a full use of Hydropathy is not necessary, if the patient seems to possess yet a sufficient amount of natural strength to produce a reaction. Homceopathic medicine, rightly administered, will be found efficacious in a majority of such cases, as the practice of thousands of homeopathic physicians proves daily. But where the patient's constitution has been weakened by the disease, strength and material power are necessary to overcome the disease. In such cases, the cold water is the only agent which can safely and quickly accomplish that. In many acute diseases, the cold water can be used to mitigate the intensity of the symptoms, in subduing local [Page 631](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/633) HYDROPATHY. 631 irritation and fever, in softening hardened surfaces, and repelling congestions. In other acute diseases, it may be applied as anrt accessory remedy, without interfering in the least with the specific action of the homceopathic medicines, as in sore throat, inflammation of the brain and other organs. In acute diseases of the skin, such as measles, scarlaLina, etc., the application of cold water on the diseased surfaces must not be attempted, except prescribed and attended to by a physician, as repressions of these eruptions on internal organs may take place, followed by dangerous consequences. We will mention here those diseases, in the treatment of which cold water may be applied, as an accessory, without hesitation. The mode of application for each disease is explained further, below. Inflammation of Internal Organs. If there is inflammation of the brain, eye, throat, bowels, liver, spleen, or kidneys, apply, beside giving the necessary homceopathic remedies for these diseases internally, cold bandages externally, as near the organs affected as possible. Their application is described below. In the commencement of those diseases, the cold bandage applied in the evening is very beneficial in its results. If applied after the disease has taken too deep a hold on the system, it is of less benefit. Congestions of the Head, Breast, and Abdomen. (Piles.) Are frequently mitigated by the application of the coldwater bandages, often changed, and foot-baths; the sitzbaths, if the abdomen is the seat of the disease. Rheumatism in its various forms, Gout, Tic Douloureux, and SciaticCa, Are diseases, where hydropathic applications may be used beneficially with the homceopathic treatment. The mode of applying the water varies in these diseases according to the ____________________________ __________ ______J [Page 632](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/634) 632 HYGIENE AND IIYDROPATHY. constitutionality of the patient and the severity of the case. The cold-water bandage, wet sheet, and local baths are mostly necessary, although sometimes warm or lukewarm applications of water may be found more serviceable. Constipation and C/ronic Diarrhea. Allows of mitigation by hydropathy; the former by the wet sheet, drinking of cold water, and a good deal of exercise; the latter by drinking cold water and using sitz-baths, with exercise and a suitable diet. Different iModes of applying the Cold Water In regard to this subject we prefer to lay before our readers what one of the most experienced hydropathists, Dr. Weiss, of Freywaldau, has communicated in his Handbook of Hydropathy: 1. Ablutions. These may be local or general; they are performed in the following manner: The naked hands, or, better, a large sponge or woolen cloth is dipped into a vessel containing cold water, placed upon a chair. The sponge is to be gently pressed, and then conveyed, for some few minutes, rapidly over the whole surface of the body; water may also, at the same time, be poured over the head; but not every one is able to bear the latter application, especially in the winter. Another method of performing ablutions with cold water, consists in wrapping a linen sheet, dipped into cold water, around the body, and thus washing all the parts; this process is more powerful, abstracting more heat from the body. In pursuing this, or any other mode of ablution, it is advisable to stand in a spacious vessel, so that the water which runs off may not wet or soil the room in which the operation is conducted. The best time, undoubtedly, for these ablutions, is the morning. They are to be performed immediately after rising [Page 633](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/635) ABLUTIONS. 633 fronm bed, Awhen the temperature of the body is raised by the heat of the bed. The sudden chanoe favors, in a great mleasure, the reaction which ensues, and excites the skin, reldered. more sensitive by the perspiration during tle nighllt, to renewed activity. In some cases, and under certain conditions, more than one of these ablutions becomes necessary the same operation may then be repeated at different inter vals. In most cases a second ablution, before going to bed, will suffice. Local ablutions will have to be repeated most frequently, where we wish to produce increased reaction; even in these cases, the temperature of the body, or its natural warmth, should be restored before proceeding to a second ablution. To increase the beneficial effects of this washing, it should be accompanied by friction during thle process; this is also essential immediately after it. Quite as necessary is exercise in the open air, if circumstances will inl any way permit it. Very great invalids only may be allowed, after washing, to retire to bed. Ablutions are, for the most part, preparations for a more powerful system of treatment, in order to accustom the body, by degrees, to water which is absolutely cold; tepid ablutions are, therefore, to be recommended at first, especially to irritable and weakly individuals, or such as have never brought cold water in contact with their bodies. Ablutions continued for a quarter of an hour, or longer, act as a stimulant and refrigerant; those of a sllorter duration have a strengthlening and exhilarating effect, and also the property of equalizing the circulation of blood, as may readily be perceived after general ablution of the whole body. Cold ablutions are fitted for all constitutions; they are best adapted for purifying and strengtllening the body; for women, weak subjects, children, and old age. Even in pulmonary complaints they produce alleviation, and even perfect amendment, where these diseases have not made too great a proglress. [Page 634](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/636) 634 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATHY. The room in which the ablution is performed, may be slightly heated, for debilitated patients, in winter, to prevent colds, in consequence of too low a temperature of the apartment; this exception is, however, only admissible for very weakly persons. Generally speaking, ablution may be performed in a cold room, especially where persons get through the operation quickly, and can, immediately afterward, take exercise in the open air. After ablutions, as regards mildness of operation, follow 2. Shower-Baths. These baths are taken in a machine, or box (Schneider's bath), constructed for the purpose. The internal arrangement of this machine, or bath, is such, that, on opening the cock closing the pipes which communicate with a reservoir, the water is brought in contact with different parts of the body at the same time, in the form of many fine streams. Very weakly or irritable people may begin with tepid water, and they will soon accustom themselves to cold water, as these baths produce a very grateful impression. Those who cannot obtain a proper machine, may stand in an empty bathing vat, or other vessel, sufficiently large, while an assistant, standing on a chair, pours water over them from a common watering-pot, which answers the purpose perfectly. The action of these baths consists in a general shock to the nervous system, and to the skin; in consequence of which, the secretion and excretion are promoted, and the whole economy benefited. They are to be recommended, chiefly, in the diseases requiring repeated sweatings for their cure for patients who, in consequence of congestions, and diseases of the chest, cannot bear the full baths after the process of sweating. These baths deserve recommendation to families. Children may be best accustomed to cold water in these machines, where the temperature can at first be raised. and tlhen gradually decreased. [Page 635](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/637) HALF-BATHS. 6 35 3. Partial, or Half-Batks. All baths, where the common bathing vats are half, or three parts filled with water, are thus denominated. The half-baths, serve, frequently, as a preparation for the fullbaths (Vollbader), or for a more active system of treatment; they have, therefore, a higher temperature, between fifty-nine and seventy-seven degrees of Fahrenheit. They should be continued from five minutes to an hour, or more, according to the purposes we have in view. If these baths be intended as a preparation for more active treatment, they must be of short duration, as also for persons who cannot bear cold baths, or full-baths. If our object be to produce a derivative effect, to remove congestions from other organs, the duration of these baths must be regulated by their effects. The patient must remain in them until revulsion is produced. Neither the temperature, nor the length of time can be determined beforehand; this must be regulated always by the constitution, the nature of the disease, or the obstinacy of the case: generally speaking, a quarter, half, or a whole hour will suffice. If our intention be to call forth a higher degree of reaction, or even fever, by these baths, the temperature must be lower, their duration extend from one to three hours. Baths continued for so great a length of time must only be used by the advice of a practical hydropathist, as they not only considerably derange the organs of digestion, but produce sufferings with which the patient was unacquainted before. The whole time the patient is in these baths, he should continually rub himself with the water contained in the vat, extending the friction to the parts above and under the water, that he may not take cold. If this mode of application be intended as preparatory to the use of cold baths, or to produce increased reaction, it is advisable to pour a few buckets of cold water over the patient before he rises from the bath. [Page 636](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/638) 636 HYGIENE AND HYDPROPATHY. Neither half-baths, nor any other kind of bath, are to be taken on a full stomach. Exercise, further, is especially to be taken after long-continued half-baths; it must not, however, bo, neglected after the use of cold water in any form.4. Full-Baths. For these baths, spacious and deep receptacles are necessary; they should admit of freedom of motion, and fresh water (if possible) should uninterruptedly flow into them. That the body must be, in a certain measure, prepared fol their use, I have already mentioned; and even after a proper preparation, as caution, it is desirable to wash the head, or pour cold water over it before entering the bath. This rule is to be strictly observed where the patient has perspired for a length of time, or where he is sufl:ering from congestions of the head and chest. The latter circumstance requires our especial consideration, where these attacks are increased after the first baths, notwithstanding the necessary preparation. Such patients must be spared the further use of them, to prevent dilatation, or rupture of blood-vessels. Only young, robust per sons may, without injury, venture, after protracted sweating, to plunge suddenly into the bath without washing the head. It is, moreover, necessary that every patient should enter the bath as soon as possible after gently and quickly cooling his head and chest; for all unnecessary delay is attended with pernicious consequences. The length of time the patient should remain in the bath varies in dififerent cases; half a minute, or one minute, is generally sufficient; an experienced hlydropathist only may prescribe full-baths for a lengthened period. During' the bath, the patient must exercise the members of the body. Immediately after leavinog the bath, he should quickly dry the whole body, using friction to promote reaction. If possible, he should perform the rubbing himself; and, where this is [Page 637](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/639) PLUNGING-BATHS. 637 impracticable, he should be aided by an assistant. Exercise, after dressing, is next required, where circumstances will allow it, in the open air, to further reaction also. Cold filll-baths are indicated in all those diseases where augmented reaction, invigoration, or a shock *to the nervous system is to be produced, where the warmth of the whole body is to be equalized; where all secreting and secerning vessels are to be invigorated; where the circulation of the blood is to be determined to the skin for the elimination of morbid matter. These baths are to be avoided, or used, at least, with caution, in all congestions, in inflammations of internal vital organs, in diseases of the chest without exception, in certain head affections, in cases where a very active crisis ensues, and in all those where violent excitements or shocks would prove injurious. 5. General Plunging-Baths. The plunging-bath should be taken like the former bath, in a large reservoir, or trough, filled with water. The patients, generally, such as cannot of themselves enter the bath, are placed upon a chair above it, arranged by means of ropes and pullies to move upward and downward, so that the patients in the sitting posture may be plunged into the water as deeply and as often as is necessary. As a substitute for an apparatus of this kind, the patient may be laid upon a sheet, held by several persons, which is quickly plunged into the water, and again withdrawn. The intention of these plungingbaths is pretty much the same as that of the former; but their action is more stimulating, and the shock severer than in those cases where the patient can enter the bath unassisted, and use exercise while bathing. Hence one, for the most, five plunges, suffice to cool the body; in obstinate nervous fevers, however, they are occasionally to be repeated several times in the course of the day. [Page 638](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/640) 638 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATHY. 6. Local-Bath.s. By this term, we understand baths of tepid or cold water, into which a portion of the body is immersed for a certain period. Their action is more powerful than that of local ablutions. We will commence-with 7. Head-Baths. They are applied, according to the object we may have in view, to different parts of the head, in the form of eye-baths, ear-baths, or derivative-baths. The use of these baths is attended with some inconvenience. A large dish or basin is to be filled with water, and placed on the floor at the upper end of a mattress. The patient lays himself at full length upon the mattress, and immerses the part of the head to be bathed into the water; e. g., if it be an eye-bath, the whole face is to be introduced into the vessel filled with water. In this case, it is necessary, moreover, to open and shut the eye-lids frequently, in order to bring the water in contact with the eye-ball. The duration of these cooling and strengthening baths is from two to six minutes, but both their duration and temperature are subject to variations. In some diseases of the eye, as we shall hereafter show, cold baths are not only inefficient, but they even augment the affection and sufferings considerably. Under these circumstances, we must endeavor to discover the temperature best adapted to the case, and make use of other detersive baths as auxiliaries. These and all other varieties of topical baths are to be repeated, according to circumstances, three to five times a day. We use for these purposes, also, boat-shaped eye-baths resembling liquor-glasses, and adapted to the shape of the eye; but baths in these vessels are less worthy of recommendation than the former bath, inasmuch as they contain a less quantity of water, and press, moreover, on the appendages of the eye. The ear-bath is taken in a similar manner; the side affected, or, where both ears are diseased, both sides are to be [Page 639](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/641) SITTING-BATHS.. t3 alternately immersed into the water, so that it may enter the meatus. These baths should, with few exceptions, be cold; their duration should extend from six to ten minutes. A more protracted use of them is not advisable, because it would produce more injury than benefit. The same applies to all head-baths. Where head-baths are used as derivatives for violent and local pains of the head, the side of the head opposite to that affected is immersed in the water for three or four minutes. This may be repeated several times during the day, if necessary. If the head-baths are to have an anodyne or soothing effect in gouty or rheumatic affections, they should be used at a temperature of fifty-nine degrees to seventy-two degrees of Fahrenheit. One side, of the head, and then the occiput, afterward the other side is to be plunged into the water, and this proceeding is to be repeated several times, until the desired alleviation ensues. In cases of necessity, this process may be repeated several times in the course of the day. 8. Sitting-bat]hs. (Sitz-baths.) For these baths we use water of various degrees of temperature. The vessel for this purpose is rather inconvenient, but so constructed that the patient can remain for the necessary time in it in the sitting posture. The dimensions of the vessel should be the following; height of the pedestal, four to five inches; the inner depth of the vessel, nine to ten inches; height of the back, six to eight inches; whole breadth of the vessel, twenty-two to twenty-four inches. These baths are made of wood or tin; the latter, however, deserve the preference. The vessel in which the bath is taken should be filled with water, until it reaches the navel of the patient when in the sitting posture. In especial cases, a greater or less height of water may be requisite. During the bath, the upper.part of the body is to remain covered, the shirt should [Page 640](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/642) 640 HYGIENE AND THYDROPATHIY. be turned up, and the legs and feet are to be enveloped in a woolen coverlet. While the person is in the bath, he should rub the abdomen witl a woolen cloth, to increase the action of the skin, and to facilitate the passage of flatulent collections. The action of sitting-baths varies, partly according to thel length of their duration, partly according to the temperature of the water. Where they are desired to have a tonic action, the temperature should be from fifty to fifty-nine degrees of Fahrienheit, and they should be continued from ten to fifteen minutes. Of course, they are to be repeated fiequently during the day. To act as a stimulant, and to produce more powerlful reaction, they must be continued for the same length of time; but their temperature must not exceed forty-one degrees to forty-four degrees of Fahrenheit. In summer, this temperature may be obtained by the aid of ice. Where the sitting-baths are to act as derivatives, determinin; the blood from parts which suffer from congestion, the patient must remain twenty minutes to half an hour in the bath. It is sometimes necessary, during the bath, to adapt cold applications (umschlage) to the parts affected; this is the more necessary, if the congestions increase during the bath. If the sitting-baths be intended to produce a solvent effect, a moderate temperature of fifty-nine degrees to sixty-eight degrees of Fahrenheit, and rather a lengthened continuation ot them, say from half an hour to an hour or more, will be required. It is, moreover, advisable, that patients suffering from obstructions or hemorrhoids, should sit in deeper water; it may, in this case, extend beyond the umbilicus. For sitting-baths in rivers, a peculiar apparatus is necessary. A board with a round hole, about eight inches in diameter, is fixed about five or six inches below the level of the water; on this aperture the patient is to sit. At a distance of more than one fathom from this board the water is [Page 641](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/643) FOOT-BATHS. 641 to be confined by means of any suitable contrivance, so that it may be made to flow with force against the abdomen during eight, at the most, fifteen minutes. In all abdominal diseases, and in debility of the organs of generation, these baths are of extraordinary benefit. Whatever object we may aim at in the use of these varieties of sitting-baths, we must not lose sight of the rule, that they are never to be taken immediately after eating (unless especial cases call for an exception), as they will otherwise derange the dioestion, and produce irregularities in the evacuations. The best time for the use of these baths, is an hour before dinner, or before going to bed. In the latter case, they offer the advantage of securing a night's rest to the patient. Generally speaking, two sitting-baths a day will suffice; in particular cases, especially, if not persevered in for a long time, five to six may be taken during the day. Exercise in the open air is to be strictly recommended both before and after these baths. 9. Foot-Baths Are taken in a small tub, or in the same vessel as the sittingbaths. The temperature and volume of water must depend on the action we wish to produce. If these baths are to act as stimulants, they must be very cold, not exceeding forty-one degrees of Fahrenheit. The water should have a depth of one, at the most, two inches, and the bath must not be continued longer than five minutes. They may be repeated several times during the day, according to circumstances. Rubbing, immediately after the baths, to promote speedy reaction, and also exercise after them, are indispensable. If the object of the foot-bath be to determine from the head or chest, the vessel must not be too large, in order that the water may become somewhat warm during the bath, which may be continued, in that case, from twenty minutes to one hour. In this case, also, the water must not be as cold as for the former purpose, and should cover the ankles. If congestion increase 54 [Page 642](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/644) 64 2 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATHY. during the batlh, cold applications should be at the same time applied to the parts affected. Friction and motion of the feet are absolutely necessary during and after the bath. A variety of other partial baths, adapted to the different members of the body, are brought into operation in a general course of treatment by cold water. The effect desired is obtained partly by the duration of the bath, partly by the temperature of the water, as I have before mentioned in speaking of local baths in general. Where the baths are to act as stimulants, the water must be very cold, not exceeding fortyone degrees of Fahrenheit; they may, however, be repeated several times in the course of the day, if requisite. They are to be continued fiom five to eight minutes. By friction, immediately after the bath, we arrive more speedily at the desired end. If the intention of these baths be to produce a soothing effect, their temperature must not be below fifty-nine degrees of Fahrenheit; they may, however, be continued for a longer period of time; fifteen to-thirty minutes will, in most cases, suffice; they may also be repeated on the return of the attacks of pain. Where their action is to be derivative, the temperature should be firom forty-six to fifty-nine degrees of Fahrenheit, and they should be continued for half an hour to one hour or longer. If they are to produce this effect gradually, and not rapidly, we frequently resort, at the same time, to applications (umschlage) to the part affected. Cooling applications, frequently repeated, will often lead to the desired result, and, at other times, applications producing warmth, will be most serviceable; we should, therefore, consider whether the object be to produce cold or heat. 10. The Drop-Bath. This term is applied to single drops of water falling from a height of several fathoms. For this forrr of bath, a vessel is used, filled with very cold water, and furnished with a very [Page 643](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/645) THE DOUCHE. 643 small aperture, through which the water passes in the form of drops. The small aperture should be partly closed by a plug, to prevent the drops from following each other in rapid succession. By these means, their operation is considerably increased, and it becomes yet more potent if we allow the drops to fall upon a particular part at certain periods, and rub the part during the intervals. The reaction about to commence, will, indeed, be thus interrupted, but will afterward make its appearance in a more powerful and energetic form. The violent excitement and irritation of the nervous system produced by these baths, render it necessary to restrict the use of them to half an hour; nor are they, indeed, adapted for vital parts, or such as are abundantly supplied with nerves. They are often used with more effect in obstinate and chronic cases of paralysis, than the douche or affusion, with which they may alternate. Powerful and continued friction with a horse-hair glove, is never, in this case, to be neglected after the baths. 11. The Douche. This description of bath is prepared with the aid of mechanical contrivances, by means of which a stream of water is made to fall upon the body with more or less force. In many respects it is most advantageous to make use of a natural fall of water for this purpose; we can then conduct the water simply into a channel, giving it a fall of twelve to twenty feet, and to the stream a caliber of half an inch to five inches. These simple douches are far less disagreeable to the sensations of the patient. than those of artificial construction. In the former, the patient can turn himself freely and alter his position so as to expose any part of the body to the stream. Douche rooms, admitting, by their construction, of the access of the air from above, produce an agreeable sensation, especially in summer, and are very beneficial in their [Page 644](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/646) 644 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATRY. action. After the first time of using these baths, the dreadful ideas whlich many patients preconceive of them quickly disappe r. Our chief consideration, in the use of the douche, should be to guard against applying it to the body when quite cold, or when in a state of perspiration after active exercise. The patient, after undressing in a moderate temperature, steps below the falling stream, attempting to receive it in the palms of his hands, that the whole force and volume of the water may not fall upon his body immediately, which is not, to say the least, at all times agreeable. After having thus prepared himself for the more potent shock, he must expose himself to the full stream, and in such a manner that the whole column of water will fall chiefly on the neck and spine. From time to time, he must equably expose the other members of the body to the stream; but the affected parts chiefly, and for a greater length of time. He should be careful not to allow the stream to fall perpendicularly on the head, chest, or on the region of the liver, especially if these parts be weak or affected with disease. The duration of the douche must be regulated by the constitution of the patient, and the effect we wish to produce; it should never be continued for less than one, nor more than twelve minutes. Where a natural douche is not to be obtained, we make use of the well known machines resembling a fire engine in shape and construction. By means of these contrivances, we may bring one or more streams of any given force into operation. Our care must be directed to the selection of cold and fresh water for this purpose; finally, the same rules are to be observed which we laid down for the use of the former douche. The period of the day at which these different douches (excepting those for the eye and ear) are used, varies. They are only to be taken, as an exception, fasting, or immediately y~~~~~I YIVI~~'- L MC [Page 645](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/647) WET BANDAGES. 645 after sweating, and never on a full stomach, nor oftener than once or twice daily. Rather active exercise should be taken after the douche, until the peculiar sensation of reaction has totally disappeared, or an uncomfortable sensation of cold, accompanied by headaches, fainting, etc., will be experienced, instead of an agreeable and beneficial glow. It is, moreover, not advisable to drink cold water immediately after the douche, because a rapid generation of heat is thus impeded, and inflammations of the stomach and bowels might be caused. The douche, the most powerful stimulant known in hydropathy, is always applicable where excitement is necessary, but attention must be paid in every case, to age, constitution, and to the vital powers. Cases are not unfrequent, where the nature of the diseases calls for this stimulant to complete the cure, but where it must be avoided in consequence of pregnancy, pulmonic affections, etc. No mode of applying cold water is more abused than the douche; in most hydropathic establishments, even at the present day, this is, unfortunately, too often the case. But very few experienced hydropathists regard it as a stimulant requiring caution. For the most part, it is looked upon as a remedy indispensable to every cure, is brought into use injudiciously, and without mature deliberation, and continued to the detriment of all organs; the beneficial results, therefore, which a judicious use of it would produce, are, necessarily, oftentimes frustrated. 12. Local Applications (Umschlaige). MIet Bandages. By these applications, two different effects may be produced, viz., that of cooling the part to which they are applied, or that of raising its temperature. Where they are intended as refrigerants or derivatives, the cloths must be of a size suited to the part inflamed; they should be folded six or eight times, dipped into very cold water, gently pressed before application, [Page 646](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/648) 6 t~G HIYGALiEE AND tYDROPATIY. and are to be renewed every four or ten minutes, according to the degrees of inflammation. If we cannot obtain water sufficiently cold in summer-time, ice must be added to it until its temperature sinks to forty-one or forty-four degrees of Fahrenheit. This low temperature is especially necessary in dangerous inflammations of important organs; e. g., of the brain. The bandages must then be continued without intermission, day and night, until danger is averted. Neglect in changing the wet clothes (umschlage), at the proper time, will cause fatal results. One omission of the change is sufficient to frustrate their beneficial operation; for violent reaction is only to be subdued by continual cold. The warming applications of cold water consist of pieces of linen folded two or three times, and dipped into cold water; they must be well pressed out before application, and not changed until they begin to dry-this is the indication for their repetition. This variety of application must be not only well adapted to the part, but it is to be further secured against the access of the air by a dry bandage, in order that the reaction it produces may generate a degree of heat in the part covered exceeding the temperature of the body. The combined action of the moisture and heat thus produced is that of a solvent or morbid matter, dispersing swellings and indurations, which are thus rendered more fit for absorption and elimination. These applications are not only well adapted for the removal of tumors, but may be applied also, with great benefit, in various cases of affections of the abdomen. Their efficacy, in all derangements of the digestive organs, and diseases of the liver, etc., is proved. The applications to the abdomen vary somewhat in form from the former bandages. A piece of linen, two yards in length, and rather more than one foot in breadth, is to be doubled, sewn together, and furnished with strings, to enable us to adapt it closely to tLe body, and secure it in its situation. In using the bandage thus arranged, about one foot of [Page 647](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/649) WET LINEN SHEETS. 647 it in length should be wetted with fresh water, well wrung out, and applied round the body; thus, the wet portion will extend once, the dry part twice round the body. These abdominal belts are to be worn according to the urgency of the case, sometimes for several hours in the day, or through the whole night; in some instances, again, for weeks, both by day and night. 13. Applications around one-half of the body, or around the whole body. Wet linen sheets. For this purpose, the bed must be prepared in the same manner as for the process of sweating. The wet sheet is laid upon the extended blanket, the patient lays himself at full length upon the former, whereupon it is folded around him, so as to come in close contact with every portion of the body. The patient is now to be enveloped in the blanket and the bed-covering (feather beds). The wet sheets are of remarkable utility in all febrile diseases. In acute fevers they must be changed according to the degree of heat, every quarter or half hour, until the dry, hot skin of the patient becomes softer, and more prone to perspiration. When this symptom is observed, the renewal of the wet cloths may be delayed for a longer period, until perspiration actually ensues. The patient must then remain for several hours in this state, until uneasy sensations, and other inconveniences, render it necessary to extricate him; but it is more advisable to keep him in the loosened envelopment until perspiration ceases spontaneously, when a tepid ablution, or half-bath, should follow. In acute eruptions of the skin, measles, scarlatina, small-pox, etc., the wet sheets are not less serviceable, when the eruption cannot make its way to the surface in consequence of the dry state an, heat of the skin, and of the violence of the fever; or where the rash has receded suddenly, owing to other disturbances. In both cases, the wet sheets are of essential service; one application [Page 648](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/650) 648 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATHY. of them suffices, sometimes to re-establish the eruption. If the rash fail to make its appearance after the first or second envelopment, cold affusion is to be preferred. There are cases in which the use of this remedy may be deemed objectionable, and a continuance of the wet sheets may appear more proper; we must, then, examine the skin carefully before every change, to see whether the eruption be nearer the surface, the skin softer, and the heat abated. In the latter case, the applications are to be discontinued, that the reaction of the skin may not be disturbed. The wet sheets, followed by tepid ablutions, cannot be sufficiently recommended, in all diseases of children. Many severe complications are averted, or relieved, at least, by them; or, where this is not the case, the disease itself is brought more speedily to a favorable termination. The envelopment in wet sheets is not only of great advantage in acute diseases, but is, also, an admirable remedy in a variety of chronic cases, attended with an irritable, rough, and inactive skin, and in a multitude of skin-diseases; but in all those cases, a frequent change of the sheets is seldom necessary. In using the envelopment, we generally raise the temperature of the patient, and occasionally allow him to perspire, according to the circumstances of the case. Determination to the head, during the process, must be removed by cold. applications to that part. If the feet remain cold for a long time in the wet cloths, and show no disposition to become warm, they are to be extricated and wrapped in the dry blanket only. 14. Sweating. In the treatment by water, perspiration is brought about in the following manner: The patient is undressed and laid upon a woolrti coverlet or blanket, extended on the bed. A servant wraps first the one side of the blanket round the body of the patient, drawing it close in all directions; grasping now firmly with the one hand the portion in which the [Page 649](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/651) SWEATING. 649 patient is enveloped, lie draws, with the other hand, the blanket round the patient, and tucks this portion also closely under him. Care must be taken that the coverings be in close contact with the body, especially at the neck, that the heat given off by the body may be well retained, and not suffered to escape. It is the excess of caloric, thus confined, which induces exhalation from the skin. Individuals who are to perspire for several hours, and cannot retain their urine long, may be furnished with a urinal, placed between the legs at the time of wrapping them up. The head may be included in the covering, or enveloped even in the pillow, so that the face alone is free, provided the patients do not suffer from congestions. The head must remain uncovered, on the other hand, if a disposition to congest be observed. Slight excitement of the vessels, before the outbreak of perspiration, generally passes off spontaneously; but where this favorable termination does not ensue, a cooling bandage (umschlige) is to be laid on the head of the patient, who must, at the same time, drink a little cold water. Warming applications (umschl!ige) are to be wrapped around all parts affected with nodes, gouty swellings, etc., before enveloping the patient. The use of these auxiliaries is to allay pain, which is generally more violent before the appearance of perspiration, and to excite a more copious exhalation from the parts to which they are applied. Patients who are very restless in the blanket, and thus loosen it, should be confined more closely in the encasement by additional cloths and girths, as they would otherwise have to remain wrapped up during half a day or longer. Persons thus enveloped being totally helpless, an assistant should be always in attendance to open the windows as soon as perspiration ensues, and to administer, every ten or fifteen minutes, as much cold water as is necessary to promote perspiration. The action of the skin must be kept up uninterruptedly, and [Page 650](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/652) 650 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATHY. the perspiration should pass off in form of vapor, or in drops, as long as the case requires it. The result of this mode of treatment is pretty certain, but the time necessary for the production of perspiration is not the same in all cases; for some individuals perspire sooner than others. The season, and many other inevitable circumstances, exert, moreover, a considerable influence on the skin; thus, some patients, especially in summer, will perspire in a quarter of an hour, while others require three to five hours for that purpose. In febrile and inflammatory diseases, we frequently cannot produce perspiration in less than twelve or twenty-four hours, although we change the wet sheets often, and resort to other auxiliary means. The best time for exciting perspiration, in chronic cases, is in the early hours of the morning, from four to five o'clock at the latest. In acute diseases, the time depends on the fever itself, or on renewed exacerbations; it must be produced, therefore, when required, without reference to time. A repetition of the process twice on the same day, is only admissible and advisable as an exception. The indication for such practice would occur more frequently in chronic than in acute diseases; because in the latter perspiration should be kept up until it ceases spontaneously, or is interrupted by other circumstances. Two sweats daily can only be recommended to the robust, and even these persons will not be able to endure the protracted sweating required in some few troublesome cases, without injuring the skin and other important organs. We cannot determine, a priori, how long each patient should sweat. The ordinary duration, in chronic cases, is from half an hour to three hours, daily; but moderate perspiration is to be encouraged for a longer time in acute diseases. Critical perspiration requires the longest duration, and should not be disturbed; we should rather, in this case, do [Page 651](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/653) SWEATING. 651 everything in our power to aid and promote it, until it ceases spon.taneously. When the patient has remained in a state of perspiration long enough, the woolen covering should be loosened about his feet and legs, to enable him to walk. The attendant then raises him in bed, and leads him to the place where be is to bathe or wash. Sedan chairs or other contrivances, will be necessary to convey patients quickly to the bath, in serious cases. No danger is to be dreaded from the transition from heat to cold (as experience in many thousand cases has proved), if the necessary precautionary rules laid down for the use of full-baths be duly observed; for, in this mode of producing perspiration, important internal organs are not excited. After the bath, the patients who can walk, or take other exercise, must not return to bed; but should dress quickly, go into the open air, drink the quantity of water prescribed, and afterward take their breakfast. Those patients, on the other hand, who can take no corporeal exercise, must be rubbed, after the bath, for some time, the friction extending over the whole surface of the body. This peculiar mode of inducing perspiration is to be brought into use in all diseases where morbid matter is to be eliminated from the system, because the skin, as daily experience teaches us, is the organ best adapted for this purpose. At the commencement of the treatment, the perspiration is clear and aqueous for some time; at a later period it becomes more viscid, then varies in color, and assumes a powerful odor. The urine, at the same time, or later, in the course of treatment, assumes the same properties in color and odor; open sores and the breath participate in this change. These symptoms usually make their appearance at different intervals, in a protracted case. Critical excretions seldom continue without intermission from their first commencement, until all extraneous substances are removed from the body; it is true, that this [Page 652](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AJY9854.0001.001/654) 65 2 HYGIENE AND HYDROPATHY. phenomenon is observed sometimes, but it is always a rare occurrence, and the critical discharges will not then unfrequently continue two to four months. There can be no doubt that an incalculable quantity of morbid matter is removed from the body in the act of perspiring; for it is often to be recognized by the organs of sense, by its color and odor during the process. Most striking is, at times, the odor of valerian, turpentine, iodine, musk, asafcetida, sulphur, and mercury. The colors observed, are generally confined to red and yellow; brown and blue are less frequently met with:the latter occurs often in the deposits in the urine, which may assume, also, all other colors.
