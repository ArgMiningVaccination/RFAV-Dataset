Clerkship Director: Yaphet Tilahun, MD, Yaphet.Tilahun.MD@AdventHealth.com Fellowship 6 Emergency Medicine Residency at AdventHealth East Orlando Emergency Medicine Rotation / 4 weeks Goals & Objectives: One of the principal goals of this clerkship is to introduce students to the role that Emergency Medicine plays in the management of acute disease. The Emergency Department provides an opportunity for significant clinical exposure and learning of many skills. Such skills include appropriately directed patient history and physical exams, differential diagnoses, medical decision making, and acquisition of procedural skills. In the ED, there is exposure to a broad base of undifferentiated patients with a wide variety of personal, social, and cultural issues that influence patient care. This environment places a premium on physical exam skills and diagnostic reasoning, emphasizing the ability to recognize life-threatening situations and initiate resuscitation in a wide range of diseases with varying degrees of urgency. Students are taught to appreciate the dynamic state of emergency medicine knowledge, the necessity for maintaining currency, and the means to do it. Although the primary teaching method employed in this Clerkship is tutorial by individual faculty members, students are also exposed to a series of videotaped lectures from the American College of Emergency Medicine covering common emergency problems. Weekly meetings are held with individual students by the Clerkship Director. Patient Care: During the fourth year EM rotation the student will individually take care of non-critical patients under direct faculty supervision. This will stimulate their critical thinking, assess their knowledge and skills, and allow them to make clinical decisions affecting patient care. Specific Learning Objectives 1.

Seidman, MD., FACS AdventHealth Orlando System - Educational Opportunity Introduction The specialty education of physicians to practice independently is experiential, and necessarily occurs within the context of the health care delivery system. Developing the skills, knowledge, and attitudes leading to proficiency in all the domains of clinical competency requires the student to assume personal responsibility for the care of individual patients. The essential learning activity is interaction with patients under the guidance and supervision of faculty members who give value, context, and meaning to those interactions. As the student (s) gain experience and demonstrate growth in their ability to care for patients, they assume roles that permit them to exercise those skills with greater independence. This concept--graded and progressive responsibility--is one of the core tenets of American graduate medical education. Supervision in the setting of graduate medical education has the goals of assuring the provision of safe and effective care to the individual patient; assuring each resident's development of the skills, knowledge, and attitudes required to enter the unsupervised practice of medicine; and establishing a foundation for continued professional growth. Otologic/Neurotologic/Skull base surgery relates to the diagnosis and management of disorders of the temporal bone, lateral skull base, and related anatomical structures, as well as advanced diagnostic expertise and advanced medical and surgical management skills beyond those attained in otolaryngology residency. Basic understanding of all Ear pathology, including but not limited to the management of patients with dizziness/vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, tumors of the skull base, chronic ear disease, otoslcerosis, glomus tumors, meningiomas, implantable hearing devices, such as cochlear implants and more. Additionally, exposure to patients with head and neck pathology, including thyroid, parathyroid disorders, head and neck cancer, free flaps, neck dissections and more is possible. There will be the opportunity for advanced didactic sessions, beyond the scope of otolaryngology residency education, in the basic sciences related to neurotology, including allergy and temporal bone histopathology, and vestibular pathophysiology. The diagnosis and therapy of advanced neurotologic disorders, including advanced audiologic and vestibular testing; the evaluation of cranial nerves and related structures; the interpretation of imaging techniques of the temporal bone and lateral skull base; and the electrophysiologic monitoring of cranial nerves VII, VIII, X, XI, and XII; 51 Patient Care and Procedural Skills Students must be able to provide patient care that is compassionate, appropriate, and effective for the treatment of health problems and the promotion of health. Students must be able to competently perform all medical, diagnostic, and gain exposure to surgical procedures considered essential for the area of practice. Patient Safety and Quality Improvement All physicians share responsibility for promoting patient safety and enhancing quality of patient care. Graduate medical education must prepare fellows to provide the highest level of clinical care with continuous focus on the safety, individual needs, and humanity of their patients. It is the right of each patient to be cared for by students who are appropriately supervised; possess the requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities; understand the limits of their knowledge and experience; and seek assistance as required to provide optimal patient care. Students must demonstrate the ability to analyze the care they provide, understand their roles within health care teams, and play an active role in system improvement processes. Graduating fellows will apply these skills to critique their future unsupervised practice and effect quality improvement measures. It is necessary for students to work with fellows and faculty members to consistently work in a well-coordinated manner with other health care professionals to achieve organizational patient safety goals. Patient Safety Culture of Safety A culture of safety requires continuous identification of vulnerabilities and a willingness to transparently deal with them. An effective organization has formal mechanisms to assess the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of its personnel toward safety in order to identify areas for improvement. Our program will provide a professional, respectful, and civil environment that is free from mistreatment, abuse, or coercion of students, residents/fellows, faculty, and staff. Programs, in partnership with their Sponsoring Institutions. In the current health care environment, Students, residents, fellows and faculty members are at increased risk for burnout and depression. Psychological, emotional, and physical well-being are critical in the development of the competent, caring, and resilient physician. Self-care is an important component of professionalism; it is also a skill that must be learned and nurtured in the context of other aspects of fellowship training. Programs, in partnership with their Sponsoring Institutions, have the same responsibility to address well-being as they do to evaluate other aspects of fellow competence. Michael D.

Patient Care Students will have the opportunity to directly participate in patient care at varying levels, based on experience, care team needs, and students' performance. At all times, exceptional patient care will be the focus of the entire clinical team (including rotating students). Patient care in Orthopaedics requires: history gathering, physical examination, interpretation of imaging studies, development of differential diagnoses, recommending treatments including both surgical and non-surgical modalities. Procedural care includes: splinting, casting, reduction maneuvers, injections, and surgical procedures. Professionalism Professionalism is a basic expectation of all rotating students. Students are expected to be punctual, dress professionally for the clinical setting, communicate clearly/respectfully/and timely with the clinical team and in all interactions with patients. 55 Medical Knowledge Students are expected to have a baseline medical knowledge consistent with their level of training.
