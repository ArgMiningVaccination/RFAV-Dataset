CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Preven- tion; SIDS, sudden infant death syndrome; AAP, American Acad-emy of Pediatrics; MPE, maximum permissible exposure. Pediatricians are fully aware of the major envi- ronmental causes of observable childhoodmorbidity and mortality (Table 1). It is also important for pediatricians to be aware of the varietyof parental concerns regarding exposures to environ- mental chemicals. During their training and practice,one of their tasks is to counsel and educate parentson how to reduce or prevent the more commonenvironmental risks (Table 1), but they have to beknowledgeable about the presence of environmentalchemical and physical toxicants and the emergingliterature on potential effects of low-level exposuresof these agents to answer patients' questions andprovide reassurance or warnings about the validrisks of some of these toxicants. This article focuseson areas of counseling for which the pediatrician can feel assured that we have sufficient information sothat attention to these issues and concerns will im-prove child health. Some of the material in this articlecan be found in more detail in the excellent Handbook of Pediatric Environmental Health . 1We have also used a format for categorizing children's environmental risks in various age categories that was used byNapier 2in Chapter 13 of Juberg's text on environ - mental chemicals.2 There has been some very good news concerning population exposures to environmental toxicantspublished by the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) in 2003. 3The report indicated that there has been \"encouraging signs that levels of lead,pesticides, and other chemicals in the body generallyhave declined over the past decade or so.\" 3The report included 27 substances that included lead,mercury, cadmium, other metals, metabolites of repellants, and disinfectants. The co-tinine levels that represent exposure to tobaccosmoke and \"pesticides,\" however, are higher in chil-dren than in adults and in children from lower so-cioeconomic backgrounds. Richard Jackson, the headof the CDC branch supervising these studies and apediatrician, summarized the status of the risk ofthese potential toxicants as follows: \"For most of thechemicals in the report, well-established guidelinesare not available.\" 3 IMPORTANT HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE: COUNSELING FAMILIES ON HOW TO PREVENT THESE TRAGEDIES 1. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The pedi- atrician knows the factors that are associated with an increased risk of SIDS, which includesthe proper position (sleeping on the back), roomtemperature, and clothing when the infant is sleeping as well as having a nonsmoking envi-ronment. 2. Trauma from falls. Pediatricians counsel parents that serious injury can occur from falls fromstrollers, from walkers, down the stairs, off thebed, out of the crib, or against sharp-corneredfurniture. The infant is especially susceptible tohead injuries. 3. Injuries or death as a passenger in automobiles. Pediatricians counsel parents about proper carseats and their installation. One does not hold an infant in one's arms anywhere in the automobile,and never is the infant positioned in the frontseat because of the serous risk to the infant if anair bag is activated. The yearly death toll of chil-dren as passengers is approximately 1700, and170 000 are injured in automobile accidents. 4. Burns from heated items or hot water. The kitchen is a dangerous place in the home. Burnsoccur from food cooking on the stove, fromspills, from hot water from the faucet, from itemsin the microwave oven and the toaster, and fromhot items pulled off the table. The bathroom isalso a dangerous place if the thermostat is set toohigh on the hot water heater. 5. Burns from fires. The sources of fire in the home are from adults smoking tobacco, sometimes ac-companied by alcohol ingestion, somnolence andignition by a dropped cigarette, children playingwith matches, poor house wiring, worn out ap-pliance wiring, defective heating systems, and From the *Thomas Jefferson University, Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Laboratory of Clinical and Environmental Teratology, Wilming-ton, Delaware; and American Academy of Pediatrics, Center for ChildHealth Research, and Department of Pediatrics, University of RochesterSchool of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York.

PEDIATRICS Vol. 113 No. 4 April 2004 1167 at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from electric and kerosene room heaters. Each home should have smoke alarms and fire extinguishersin appropriate locations. 6. Choking, strangulation, and suffocation. Hun- dreds of infants and children die each year be- cause of being entangled in drapery, cradle gym,or venetian blind cords; suffocated or trapped betweencrib or playpen slats that are too wide; or chok-ing on inappropriate food, toys, or balloons. 7. Poisoning. Rarely, poisoning with drugs or chemicals is committed by a caregiver or a parentas a component of child abuse (Munchausen syn-drome by proxy). In the vast majority of cases, itis attributable to easy access to drugs and chem-icals by the infant who can crawl or stand even before 1 year of age. The household items in-clude medications; caustics used as drain clean-ers; solvents, eg, Lily of theValley. 8. Drowning. The incidence of drowning varies by locality. In states such as Florida and California,drowning occurs almost daily because of thehigher number of homes with swimming pools.It is the second highest cause of death in childrenand involves inattentiveness on the part of the caregiver whether it occurs in a swimming pool, bathinette, bathtub, or 6 inches of water in awading pool. A life preserver may not providesufficient protection to save an infant 's life in a boating accident. Children are not water safeuntil age 4 if they have been trained to swim. 9. Bicycling with an infant. Riding a bicycle with the infant wearing a helmet and sitting in aninfant seat is dangerous and is an inappropriateactivity for an infant. 10. Guns in the home. Guns in the home are danger- ous even for infants if there are older siblings andthe gun and ammunition are not properly storedand locked. 11. Vaccination schedule as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Thesmall percentage of families who refuse to vac-cinate their children not only are jeopardizingthe health of their children but frequently at-tempt to proselytize their neighbors and friendsto accept this dangerous viewpoint. This is animportant challenge for pediatricians and familyphysicians. Failure to obtain proper vaccinationscan result in serious illness and major disruptionand guilt in these families. 12. Electrocution. Electric outlets that are uncovered should be blocked with plastic plug inserts.Frayed or brittle electric cords to lamps and ap-pliances should be replaced. Biting these electric cords can result in electric shock and electricburns that can be life-threatening. 13. Secondhand smoke. Parents who smoke at home or in their car in the presence of their childrencreate an atmosphere that increases the risk forSIDS, hospitalization for respiratory infection, asthma, and other upper respiratory problems.See the article \"Prenatal and Postnatal Environ- mental Tobacco Smoke Exposure and Children 's Health \"in this supplement. 4Parents who smoke not only harm their children 's health but also serve as their role models. Children of parents who smoke are more likely to smoke as adults and adopt other addictive habits. These factshave to be told directly and effectively to parents. 14. Lead poisoning. Although access to lead-contain- ing materials is limited during the first 6 monthsof life, as the child begins to crawl, stand, and putthings into his or her mouth, the opportunity forlead poisoning is present. Fortunately, because ofthe lead abatement program initiated in theUnited States 30 years ago, the opportunities forthe\"old time \"lead poisoning have diminished. In the 1950s and 1960s in the cities of the north- eastern United States, children with blood leadlevels/H1102260 /H9262g/dL were admitted to the hospital with encephalopathy, increased intracranial pressure, severe hypertension, anemia, lead lines in the long bones, abnormal porphyrin metabo- lism, basophilic stippling of the red blood anemia. Children with bloodlead levels /H1102140 /H9262g/dL had lessor effects, and there was a decrease in intellect that was linearly related to the lead exposure. The CDC estab- lished a threshold exposure for intellectual re- duction at 10 /H9262g/dL in 1991. This was an un- usual decision by the CDC, because there was no suggestion for the maximum permissible expo- sure (MPE) other than the 10 /H9262g/dL, so this was the first time in the history of environmental toxicology that the MPE and the threshold expo- sure were the same. Ordinarily, the MPE is some fraction of the threshold exposure, eg, anywherefrom 1/10th to 1/1000th the threshold exposure. The CDC 3recently reported some optimistic news about the lead levels in children in theUnited States: during 1991 -1994, 4.4% of children exceeded the 10 /H9262g/dL threshold level. In the current report, the CDC indicated that this hasfallen to 2.2%. In addition, the mean blood leadlevels have fallen from 2.7 /H9262g/dL to 2.2 /H9262g/dL. Unfortunately, third-world countries have chil-dren with much higher lead levels, and few ofthese countries have eliminated lead from theirgasoline. Recent data, as described in the article\"Lead \"in this supplement, also suggest that even levels /H1102110 /H9262g/dL may result in decreases in cognitive functioning.5Pediatricians still have to be concerned about old homes that containlead-based paint, plaster and putty, old toys,cribs, and imported pottery that may contain lead. 15. Sunburn. Infants should have minimal exposure to the direct rays of the sun by using covered carriages and hats. Their skin is thin or morereadily burns with excessive sun exposure. It is probably better to avoid the sun rather than de-pend on sunscreens during the first year. 1168 EDUCATING PARENTS ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from 16. Food poisoning. Bacterial contamination of food products may occur at the commercial site of preparation. In the home, protection can be pro-vided by adequate cooking of the food, hand-washing, and thorough washing of the food preparation surfaces and food utensils beforeand after preparation. Food poisoning can alsooccur at celebrations because of poor food stor-age before the event or because the food is out-side in warm or sunny weather. It is regretfulthat many of the groups that criticize the foodindustry for distributing food products that arecontaminated with Escherichia coli , salmonella, and other pathogens oppose the radiation offoods, which would prevent most of these infec-tions and decrease the cost of food preparation and storage. 17. Child care. Most child care facilities provide quality, compassionate care. However, childrenwho attend child care facilities have higher inci-dences of bacterial and viral infections. The qual-ity of personnel at child care facilities varies, asdoes the quality of handwashing procedures,food sanitation, and diaper changing areas andcompliance for administering medications. Chil-dren are at greater risk for various types of childabuse. IMPORTANT HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES FROM AGES 1 TO 4: COUNSELING FAMILIES ON HOW TO PREVENT THESE TRAGEDIES 1. Accidental injury and death. This is an age when proper caution is not a consistent part of a child 's behavior. Taking chances by darting into the street, crossing unattended, and playing in thestreet all are activities that can result in tragedy; 35% of pedestrian accidents involve children.Children of this age should never cross the streetwithout adult supervision. Each year in theUnited States, approximately 1800 children aged19 and younger are killed and 50 000 are injuredin pedestrian -motor vehicle collisions. Children have to be taught that the street is a dangerousplace, again and again. 2. Falls. Falls are still very common in children 1 to 4 years of age and are the fifth leading cause ofaccidental death for children of this age. Falls from second-story windows, stairs, trees, garageroofs, and ladders result from the risk-takingbehavior of this group of children and the ab-sence of adult supervision and training. 3. Automobile passenger injuries and death. The use of age-appropriate car seats placed properlyin the rear seat of the automobile is essential.There is no reason to have a child this age in thefront seat as a passenger. A child also should notbe allowed to travel in the truck bed of a pickuptruck or in the enclosed compartment in the rearof a truck. Nearly 60% of accidents to pedestriansunder age 5 happen in their own driveway whena family member backs over them. 4. Burns. Refer to the infant section with regard to burns. In addition, children this age should nothave access to matches, cigarette lighters, pro-pane fire igniters, or flint igniters. Even magni- fying glasses if used improperly can start a firethat could result in burns. Teach children that\"fire is a tool, not a toy. \" 2 5. Choking and strangulation. Items placed in a child 's mouth that can be aspirated may result in respiratory compromise. Items of concern are toys with small parts, deflated balloons, and in- appropriate foods for the child 's capability, eg, peanuts, raisins, raw carrots, popcorn. 6. Drowning. More than two thirds of the children who are involved in near-drowning incidents are younger than 4 years, with boys outnumbering girls by 2:1. An estimated 90% of drowningdeaths among children aged 1 to 3 occur in res-idential swimming pools. Floatation devices forchildren who are unattended may promotedrowning rather than prevent it. Pools, hot tubs,and wading pools must have supervision and befenced in, locked, or covered. 7. Poisoning. See infant section. 8. Lead poisoning. See infant section.9. Continue vaccination schedule of AAP. 10. Bicycle injuries and fatalities. Bicycle injuries oc- cur because of falling and collision with station-ary objects (eg, buildings, trees, posts). Injuriesoccur because the bicycle or tricycle may not bethe correct size for the child, because the child isnot wearing a helmet, or because the child lacksthe skill to maneuver appropriately. Make cer-tain that the bicycle is visible by using a pendanton a pole so that motor vehicle drivers arealerted to the presence of a bicycle. The highest morbidity and mortality occur from collisions of a cycle and an automobile. 11. Electrocution. See infant section.12. Secondhand smoke. See infant section.13. Sunburn. Although young children 's skin is a little tougher than that of an infant, parents should take every precaution to prevent sun-burn. Here 's how: use a sunscreen of at least SPF 15, possibly higher if their skin is sensitive or ifthey will be out all day. Repeat application whenstaying in the sunshine for prolonged periods;also, repeat application if children go in and outof the water. Limit exposure during the sun 's peak strength, 10 AM to 3 PM, even on cloudydays. 14. Obesity. The lifelong habits of eating and exer- cise are beginning to be developed during thisage period. Because obesity is a serious problemin the United States, pediatricians have to take amore proactive stand in counseling familiesabout this serious problem. Hip and knee re-placements, cardiovascular diseases, some can-cer, and diabetes all are increased in the obesepopulation. This is a total family problem. Whenobesity exists in 1 member of the family, thefamily has to be mobilized into action. Properamounts and types of food, along with exercise,are needed. 15. Food poisoning. See infant section.16. Child care. See infant section. SUPPLEMENT 1169 at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from IMPORTANT HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES FROM AGES 5 TO 9: COUNSELING FAMILIES ON HOW TO PREVENT THESE TRAGEDIES Injuries remain the leading cause of death in this age group. In fact, more school-aged children die from injuries than from all other diseases combined. 1. Pedestrian injuries. Pedestrian injuries remain the most common cause of death from trauma for children aged 5 to 9 in the United States. Helpchildren to understand the following street-smart rules. Most parents consider a child thisage to be able to cross the street without super-vision, which is a mistake with some children inthis age group. Children this age need constantreminders of the safety procedures to followwhen crossing a street. It may not be safe to crosswhen the light is green. Drivers may not see youand may not stop. Impulsive children or those who are taking some psychopharmacologic med-ications may need supervision when crossing thestreet. 2. Falls. See section on 1- to 4-year-olds. In this age group, it is common for families to purchasebunk beds. The risk of falls from bunk beds isincreased if the bed is not equipped with a siderail in the upper bunk. 3. Automobile injuries. See previous age group sec- tions. 4. Drowning and swimming accidents. See section on 1- to 4-year-olds. In addition, children aged 5to 9 are more mobile and are able to travel tostreams and other bodies of water that are notsafe and where supervision is not available. Theymay also venture into these waters withoutknowing the depth and without being able toswim. Children who swim unsupervised maynot leave the water in an electrical storm. 5. Bicycle injuries. See section on 1- to 4-year-olds. Children in grades 1 through 6 are at the greatestrisk for bicycle injuries. Each year, approxi-mately 400 children younger than 15 years arekilled in the United States while riding bicycles,and almost 400 000 require emergency depart-ment treatment. Bicycle helmets reduce the riskof head injury by 85% and brain injury by nearly90%. Despite this, helmets are used by a smallpercentage of child bicyclists. Proper equipmentand riding in safe locations and at safe times (notat dusk or night time) will help to reduce bicycle-related risks. 6. Sports injuries. An estimated 65 000 children need hospital emergency department treatmenteach year for skateboard injuries, with 7 of every10 such injuries incurred by children youngerthan 15 years. Football is 1 of the most dangerousathletic activities, causing some 57 injuries forevery 100 players. Proper supervision and equip-ment dramatically reduce the risks in footballand other contact sports such as hockey andlacrosse. Boxing carries such a high risk of braininjury that experts advise parents and youngpeople not to participate. Equipment that should be used to reduce injuries includes shoulderpads, helmets, kneepads, tear-away bases, mouth protection bite plates, and appropriate gloves. 7. Burns. See previous age group sections.8. Secondhand smoke. See infant section.9. Choking and strangulation. See previous age group sections. 10. Poisoning. See previous age group sections. 11. Lead poisoning. See previous age group sections.12. Guns. See infant section. Death and injury to children occur daily from accidental, self-in- flicted, and intentional shootings, as well as by drive-by shootings. Forty million Americanhomes have firearms. Children in this age groupmay be more aware of the location of guns in thehome and also be allowed to view television withviolence-based plots in which guns play a majorrole. The most sensible method to stop the maim- ing and killing of children from guns is to restrict the use of handguns to law enforcement officers.Even these individuals who have been trained ingun safety have tragedies in their homes result-ing in death of and injury to children. 13. Food poisoning. See previous age group sections.14. Vaccinate according to the AAP guidelines.15. Electrocution. See infant and 1- to 4-year-old sec- tions. In addition, older children who play andgo to school unattended can come in contact withdowned power lines and may have access tohigh-voltage transformers, both of which canlead to lethal injuries and burns. Similarly, light-ning can be dangerous and children have to betaught what to do and what not to do when a thunder and lightening storm approaches. IMPORTANT HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES FROM AGES 10 TO 18: COUNSELING FAMILIES ON HOW TO PREVENT THESE TRAGEDIES As children grow into adolescence, they spend more time away from home and therefore parental supervision. Peer pressure is in competition with parental supervision. Peers can be a positive influ- ence or a negative influence. This is the age of per-ceived invincibility and risk taking. This is the timeto be able to say \"no\"to requests or activities that may jeopardize health and safety. 1. Automobile injuries. See previous age group sec- tions. Automobile accidents are a major cause ofmortality and serious injury. Reckless driving,impulsive behavior, showing off, or drivingwhile intoxicated all pose specific risks. Not onlydo teenagers have higher accident rates, but the incidence increases proportionally with the num- ber of teenage passengers in the car. Instruct teens not to \"park \"with their dates with cars running. This remains a common cause of carbonmonoxide poisoning. 2. Burns. See infant section.3. Poisoning. See infant section. In addition, teen- agers become involved with illegal drugs thatmay result in overdoses that lead to illness ordeath. 1170 EDUCATING PARENTS ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from 4. Drowning and other swimming accidents. Older children may overestimate their stamina, endur- ance, and capability to swim long distances or inrough water. Children should always swim withanother swimmer. If they do not know the depth of water, then they should be encouraged tojump feet first to avoid hitting their head on ashallow bottom. Horseplay on docks or boatsshould be discouraged. When boating, everyonealways should wear lifejackets, and no oneshould undertake manning a boat that they havenot been trained to use. 5. Sports injuries. See 5- to 9-year-old section.6. Bicycle injuries. See 5- to 9-year-old section.7. Guns. See 1- to 4-year-old and 5- to 9-year-old sections. 8. Injury from power tools and farm equipment. Farming is the most dangerous occupation in America, and children and adolescents make upa significant part of the farming workforce. Ofthe machine-related deaths of children on farms,tractors account for half of the fatalities. Powertools and gardening equipment are also respon-sible for many injuries. Nearly 10 000 childrenaged 15 and younger are hurt by lawn mowerseach year. If children work on a farm, then clearuse and safety instructions should be provided.They should know which equipment is off-limitsuntil appropriate age. Lawn and garden equip-ment should be stored properly, making them inaccessible to children. Children younger than 12 years should not be allowed to operate walk-behind mowers, and children younger than 14should not be allowed to operate ride-on mow-ers. 9. Fires. Children and teenagers who sleep above the living quarters are vulnerable to the smokeinhalation produced by fires that start on the firstfloor by a parent who is watching television, issmoking, and falls asleep. 10. Smoking. Parents who smoke are more likely to have children who smoke. Smoking is a greattemptation for youths who wish to be \"cool. \" Unfortunately, children and even adults fail tounderstand the addictive nature of cigarettes andthe disastrous illness consequences of smoking.Most adult smokers who have a difficult timequitting picked up the habit as teens. 11. Illicit drug use. Parents have to pay attention to their teenager 's behavior and activities. Changes in behavior, friends, sleep habits, grades inschool, personality, and reactions may be signsof drug abuse. Missing money or valuable itemsfrom the house may not be the result of an in-truder but rather a teenager. Alcohol is the pro-totype drug of abuse. Unfortunately, it is legal,and it therefore reflects the hypocrisy in oursociety about illicit drugs. Cigarettes are in thesame category. Both are highly addictive. Drink- ing and driving is a killer for the teenager, pas-sengers, and other drivers who may be involvedin an accident with the drunken teenager. 12. Sexually transmitted diseases. Sexually transmit- ted disease can be life-threatening, cause infertil-ity or sterility, and increase the risk of cervical cancer. Monitoring the sexual activity of a teen-ager is a difficult task. Discussions of sex, absti- nence, and fidelity in marriage have to begin at an early age, and the parents have to set anexample. Children must be taught that infectionwith human immunodeficiency virus may be adeath sentence. 13. Pregnancy. From the ages of 15 to 19, the most common reason for hospitalization is pregnancy.Condoms and birth control pills are not 100%effective as contraceptives. Many of these preg-nancies are single-mother pregnancies. Childrenhaving children represents a tragedy for many of these families. 14. Vaccinate against disease. Teenagers need vacci- nations. Check the AAP guidelines. 15. Suicide. Depression is a common problem among teenagers. Frequently, the family and theteenager deny the presence of depression and theseverity of the symptoms. Signs of depressionoverlap with the signs of drug abuse: change insleep habits, loss of appetite, lowering of schoolgrades, loss of weight or gain in weight, changein study habits, nonsocial behavior, and suicidalthoughts that are verbal or written. These behav-iors may be ignored by parents, friends, andteachers. Suicide completers have a higher inci-dence of having both a gun and alcohol avail- able. Tragically, suicide is 1 of the leading causesof death in teenage years. 16. Sunburn. See previous age group sections. Avoid tanning salons. Limit sun exposure. 17. Electrocution. Besides the warnings listed for the younger children, teenagers may have access tofuse boxes and power tools. GENERIC PROBLEMS FOR ALL AGES 1. Obesity. The problem of obesity can begin in in- fancy, childhood, or adolescence. At the begin- ning of the 21st century, we are in the midst of anational epidemic of obesity. The cause of thisepidemic is many-fold. In children, it is the com- bination of watching hours of television and eat-ing food from fast food restaurants with a largenumber of calories. Snacks are available row afterrow on the supermarket shelves, consisting offried chips, cookies, and candies. Portions servedat home and in restaurants are oversized andestablish very bad eating habits. Families need todevelop a healthful eating program, which con-sists of fresh fruits and vegetable and no morethan 30% fat in the diet, but the key is to limit the total number of calories to what is required. An exercise program should be developed for everyfamily member and for a family with an obesityproblem. The family should be made to realizethat obesity is a major cause for weight-bearingjoint replacement, cardiovascular disease, stroke,hypertension, pulmonary decompensation, anddiabetes. Pediatricians should be the first line ofdefense against this epidemic and should be per-sistent in their effort to get the family to commit SUPPLEMENT 1171 at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from themselves to a weight reduction and weight maintenance program. 2. Osteoporosis. A significant proportion of adult women and some men have a low bone density,which makes them prone to fracture of the hip and spine in later years. Adequate intake of cal-cium and vitamin D should be a life-long habit. Ifadequate calcium and vitamin D are not part ofthe diet, then the diet should be supplementedwith calcium and vitamin D. The third componentto prevent osteoporosis is weight-bearing exer-cise. An exercise program should be part of everyfamily 's activities. PARENTAL CONCERNS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED The news media and Internet are the sources of information that may be anxiety provoking to par- ents. The pediatrician has the responsibility to beknowledgeable about some of these concerns andshould be able to provide answers if there are ade- quate data that allow a definitive conclusion. Manytoxicants are obviously deleterious at high expo-sures. The question that is difficult to answer withregard to many chemical agents is whether they havereproductive, neurobehavioral, or oncogenic effectsat low exposures. Environmental chemicals exposeinfants, children, and adolescents as well as adults tolow levels of these agents. Confusion arises whenMPEs are exceeded or when the data that were usedto establish the MPE were incomplete or flawed. Ifthe no-observable-adverse-effect level were 1 to 3orders of magnitude higher than the MPE, then sci- entists would be of the opinion that an exposureslightly above the MPE has no toxicologic signifi-cance. RESEARCH IS STILL ONGOING The week that the manuscripts for this supplement were being submitted to Pediatrics , 4 letters to the editor and responses appeared in The Lancet .6-9The authors of these letters disagree on whether there are deleterious effects from low-level mercury exposure. 1. Mercury in dental amalgams. The studies to de- termine the mercury levels associated with amal- gams are still being evaluated. When the studiesare completed, the information should be imme-diately made available to pediatricians. 2. Mercury in edible fish. Although we have an MPE that has been established, we do not have thevarious no-observable-adverse-effect levels forvarious neurotoxic and developmental effects ofmercury.
