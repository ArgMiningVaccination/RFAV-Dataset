OVERVIEW The Department of Human Services (DHS) defines Integrated Community Wellness Centers (ICWC) as a service delivery model that requires coordinated, comprehensive and quality care. Additional requirements include the provision of nine (9) core services; common data collection and reporting on quality measures; and a payment system that reimburses providers for the prospective cost of delivering services. Each ICWC will offer care th at is person -centered and family- centered in accordance with the requirements of section 2402(2) of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), trauma -informed, and recovery- oriented, and that the integration of physical and behavioral health care will serve the \"whole person\". The ICWC populations to be served are adults with serious mental illness, children with serious emotional disturbance, and those with long term and serious substance use disorders, as well as others with mental illness and substance use disord ers. B. CORE SERVICES The Primary Contractor and/or its BH -MCO must contract with each ICWC to deliver the following nine core services: Crisis Mental Health Services, including 24 - hour mobile crisis team, emergency crisis intervention, and crisis stabilization Targeted case management Outpatient mental health and substance use services Patient -centered treatment planning, including risk assessment and crisis planning Screening, assessment, and diagnosis, including risk assessment Psychiatric rehabi litation services Peer support and counselor services and family support Intensive, community- based mental health care for veterans and members of the military Outpatient clinic primary care screening and monitoring of key health indicators and health risk C. PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM Each ICWC will be paid via a monthly Prospective Payment System (PPS) rate. The Primary Contractor and/or its BH -MCO must pay each ICWC in its network the PPS rate for its enrolled ICWC members for the nine core services durin g the contract year. The PPS rates will be incorporated into the Capitation rates. The Primary Contractor will be notified of each participating ICWC and the PPS rate to be paid in full via separate correspondence. 2 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix A Appendix A The Primary Contractor and/or its BH -MCO must ensure its provider agreement with each ICWC in its network reflects the new payment methodology (PPS). D. DESIGNATED COLLABORATING ORGANIZATIONS An ICWC is permitted to have a sub -contractual arrangement with one (1) or more Designated Collaborating Organizations (DCO) to provide one (1) or more of the required services. The DCO is not under the direct supervision of the ICWC but is engaged in a formal relationship with the ICWC and delivers services under the same requirements as the IC WC. However, the ICWC is financially and clinically responsible for the services provided by the DCO as defined by the sub - contractual arrangement. Payment for the DCO is included within the scope of the ICWC PPS, and qualifying DCO rendered services will be reported through claims submitted by ICWCs to the BH -MCO. DCOs will receive payment for qualifying services through the ICWC in accordance with the sub -contractual arrangement. Services of a DCO are distinct from referred service in that the ICWC is not financially and clinically responsible for referred services. The Primary Contactor and/or its BH -MCO must ensure there are no duplicative payments to either the ICWC or its DCO. E. UDATA COLLECTION, REPORTING AND TRACKING 1. The Primary Contractor or its BH -MCO must provide ICWC -level Medicaid encounter data on all prescribed measures. 2. The Primary Contractor or its BH -MCO must ensure that there are no duplicative encounters for all prescribed measures submitted by the DCO a nd the ICWC. 3. All encounters must be submitted and approved in PROMISe (i.e., pass PROMISe edits) on or before 90 days following the date that the BH -MCO paid/adjudicated the provider's claim or encounter. The Primary Contractor and its BH -MCO and subcont ractor(s) shall be responsible for maintaining appropriate systems and mechanisms to obtain all necessary data from its health care providers to ensure its ability to comply with encounter data reporting requirements; including checks for encounter duplica tions. In addition, all encounters must be timely, accurate and complete in accordance with Appendix R. 4. The Department has the right to request ICWC data at any time from the Primary Contractor, their BH -MCO, and/or ICWC providers. 5. Data reporting on all prescribed ICWC quality measures as established by the Department will be required.

OVERVIEW The Department is continuing a Pay for Performance Program (P4P) for all Pr imary Contractors per HEDIS and select Pennsylvania Performance Measures (PAPMs) as defined in this Appendix. This P4P program is aligned with the Department 's goal of greater integration and coordination between behavioral health (BH) and physical health (PH) services. The Department expects this ICP Program to improve the quality of health care and reduce MA expenditures through enhanced coordination of care between PH -MCOs , BH- MCOs , Primary Contractors and Providers. The Department will provide a funding pool from which Primary Contractor will be paid on a weighted basis based on the combined PH/BH -MCO performance measures outlined in this Appendix. The Primary Contractor shall require its BH- MCO to meet the below requirements . UIn order to be eligible for payments under the ICP U, the BH -MCO must provide an Annual Integrated Care Plan Program Report (AICPR) for Calendar Year (CY) 20 21 that contains the following specific data requirements for individuals with serious mental illness (SMI). SMI is identified through the following ICD -10 - Schizophrenic Disorders F25.xx- Schizoaffective Disorder F30.xx- F33.9x - Episodic Mood Disorders (i.e. Bipolar, Manic Affective Disorder, Major Depressive Affective Disorder) F28 and F29 - Other Nonorganic Psychoses F60.3 - Borderline Personality Disorder The AICPR is subject to audit by the Department to verify the accuracy of the stratification, ICP and hospital notification information. 1. Member stratification - A stratification shall be conducted on all M embers in the targeted SMI population. New M embers shall have an initial stratification level established within sixty (60) days of the date of enrollment. and Existing Member s after having the initial stratification level established will have a stratification conducted at a minimum every six (6) month there after. . The BH -MCO will report the M ember ID, initial stratification level, and stratification level every six (6) month s. By submitting the AICPR, the BH -MCO is representing that the dates the stratification was conducted included in the AICPR are accurate. For the Primary Contractor to receive the P4P payment the percentage of the Members having stratifications done at least every six (6) months must be equal to or greater than ninety percent. Members will be stratified as follows: Appendix E 2 HC BH Program Standards & Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix E a. Four (4) = high PH/high BH needs b. Three (3) = high PH/low BH needs c. Two (2) = low PH/high BH needs d. One (1) = low PH/low BH needs 2. Integrated Care Plan (ICP) - The Department will inform the Primary Contractor and its BH -MCO of its target ICP number. The total number of ICPs assigned each year for BH c are management activity will equal the total number of ICPs assigned for PH care management activity in that same year . For purposes of this requirement, the Department considers an ICP to be the collection, integration and documentation of key physical and behavioral health information that is easily accessible in a timely manner to persons with designated access. The BH-MCO shall review and update the ICP annual ly and assign a review date in the AICPR submission. An ICP will count toward the Primary Contractor's assigned number if: a. the AICPR has an ICP date in the year reviewed ; or b. the M ember disenrolled during that CY but the ICP date is in the year reviewed . An ICP will not count towards the Primary Contractor's assigned number if the Member has been disenrolled from the BH- MCO and the ICP date is not in the year reviewed. In order to receive a P4P payment , the ICP target number must be met. 3. Hospitalization Notification and Coordination - Each BH -MCO is responsible for notifying the appropriate PH -MCO of all inpatient hospital admission s and c oordinat ing discharge and follow -up with the appropriate PH -MCO. Notification should include, M ember identification, the date of inpatient admission and name of the acute care hospital. Additional information that will enable greater integration and coordination between behavioral health and physical health services may be shared as permitte d by federal and state confidentiality laws and regulations . The BH -MCO shall notify the appropriate PH -MCO of a hospital admission within one (1) business day of when the BH- MCO learns of the admission (e.g., if the BH- MCO knows of an admission, it will notify the PH -MCO within one (1) business day and vice versa). By submitting the AICPR, the BH- MCO is representing that the admission notification date s included in the AICPR are accurate. The BH -MCO must maintain documentation of the date the BH -MCO notified the PH-MCO of the admission. The AICPR will be reviewed by the Department to determine how frequently the BH- MCO notified the PH-MCO within one ( 1) business day of the M ember 's hospitaliz ation . For the Primary Contractor to receive the P4P payment th e percentage of notifications occurring within one ( 1) business day must be equal to or greater than ninety percent. Appendix E 3 HC BH Program Standards & Requirements - January 1, 20 21 Appendix E B. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR THE AICPR For CY 2021, the P rimary C ontractor and it s BH- MCO must create a process to share the ICP with the Member and the Member's behavioral health Provider. The Primary Contractor and its BH-MCO must record the date the ICP was shared in the AICPR. C.

Narrative summarizing how the \"coordinated\" principle will be strengthened: Appendix J Page 1 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix J DEPARTMENT OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL PROGRAMS Principles of Effective Treatment Background Alcohol and other drug abuse and dependency treatment services must be provided by facilities licensed by the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs, Division of Drug and Alcohol Licensure, to ensure that minimum standards are being maintained to protect the health, safety and welfare of the individual. Philosophy Substance abuse and dependence are primary diseases, not symptoms of other underlying conditions. Substance use disorders can be diagnosed, are responsive to treatment and are complex behavioral disabilities usually having chronic medical, social and psychological components, which result in multiple negative consequences. Substance abuse and dependence related problems affect not only the dependent individual, but other family members, particularly children. Denial is a central characteristic or symptom of substance abuse and dependence that complicates an individual's ability to acknowledge a problem. Principles Treatment needs to be readily available . Because individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder may be uncertain about entering treatment, taking advantage of opportunities when they are ready for treatment is crucial. Potential treatment applicants can be lost if treatment is not immediately available or is not readily accessible. No single treatment is appropriate for all individuals . Matching treatment settings, interventions, and services to each individual's particular problems and needs is critical to his or her ultimate success in returning to productive functioning in the family, workplace, and society. Effective treatment attends to multiple needs of the individual, not just his or her substance use. To be effective, treatment must not only address the individual's substance use but any associated medical, psychological, social, vocational, and legal problems. Appendix J Page 2 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix J Individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder and with a coexisting mental disorders should have both disorder treated in an integrated way. Because addictive disorders and mental disorders often occur in the same individual, persons presenting for either condition should be assessed and treated for the co-occurrence of the other type of disorder. Both disorders are considered primary. Treatment should be person specific and guided by an individualized treatment plan based upon a face to face comprehensive biopsychosocial evaluation of the person and when possible, a comprehensive evaluation of the family as well. Counseling (individual and group) and other behavioral therapies are critical components of effective treatment for substance use disorder. In therapy, the person addresses issues of motivation, build skills to resist substance use, replace substance- using activities with constructive and rewarding nonsubstance -using activities, and improve problem -solving abilities. Behavioral therapy also facilitates interpersonal relationships and the individual's ability to function in the family and community. Self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous and Double Trouble are essential adjuncts to the treatment process. Attendance should be encouraged when appropriate. Medications are an important element of treatment for many individuals, especially when combined with counseling and other behavioral therapies. Methadone and buprenorphine are very effective in helping individuals dependent upon opiates stabilize their lives and reduce their illicit drug use. Naltrexone is also an effective medication for some individuals diagnosed with opiate dependency as well as a co-occurring alcohol dependence. For persons dependent upon nicotine, a nicotine replacement product (such as patches or gum) or an oral medication (such as bupropion) can be an effective component of treatment. For individuals diagnosed with mental disorders, both behavioral treatments and medications can be critically important. Treatment programs should provide assessment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B and C, Tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, and counseling to help individuals modify or change behaviors that place themselves or others at risk of infection. Counseling can help individuals avoid high- risk behavior. Counseling also can help people who are already infected manage their illness. Appendix J Page 3 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix J Remaining in treatment for an adequate period of time is critical for treatment effectiveness. The appropriate duration for an individual depends on his or her problems and needs. Research indicates that for most people, the threshold of significant improvement is reached at about 3 months in treatment. Treatment may include Residential care followed by Intensive Outpatient care or Partial treatment followed by Outpatient care, or any movement through the level of care continuum. After this threshold is reached, additional treatment can produce further progress toward recovery. Because people often leave treatment prematurely, programs should include strategies to engage and keep people in treatment. Recovery from substance use disorders can be a long-term process and frequently requires multiple episodes of treatment . As with other chronic illnesses, relapses to substance use can occur during or after successful treatment episodes. Individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder may require prolonged treatment and multiple episodes of treatment to achieve long- term abstinence and fully restored functioning. Participation in self-help support programs during and following treatment often is helpful in maintaining long- term abstinence. Treatment does not need to be voluntary to be effective . Strong motivation can facilitate the treatment process. Sanctions or enticements in the family, employment setting, or criminal justice system can increase significantly both treatment entry and retention rates and the success of substance use treatment interventions. Persons recovering from substance use disorders are viewed as important resources in the statewide service system . As representatives of the recovering community, persons in recovery serve as an inspiration to the individuals struggling with a substance use disorder. As a practicing professional they provide an empathetic and knowledgeable approach to treatment philosophy, offer valuable input into the recovering community network, and serve as a voice for advocacy. The majority of the above Principles are adapted from the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA). Appendix K HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix K.1 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS (BH-MCOs) PERFORMANCE/OUTCOME MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (POMS) A. OVERVIEW The POMS consists of a database that is updated on a periodic basis through batch data file extracts that are obtained from a variety of data sources (see attached table of outcome measures and data sources). The database, which is maintained and managed by the Department of Human Services (DHS), contains an extensive array of raw data concerning enrollees in the BH -MCOs. The primary purpose of the database is to serve as the basis for producing a set of performance measures/indicators. The Department will utilize the performance measures/indicators as its primary tool for continuously evaluating the effectiveness of the BH- MCO contractors in achieving a variety of systems level outcomes. The POMS serves the following primary functions: (1) Provides accountability for public funds expended through the Department's capitation payments to the BH-MCO contractors. (2) Provides a fair and objective evaluation of the BH -MCOs that the Department can use for implementing outcome oriented incentives and sanctions. (3) Supports the Department and the BH -MCO contractors to implement a collaborative continuous Quality Improvement process. B. DATA COLLECTION PROCESSES Raw data concerning BH-MCO enrollees, obtained from a variety of sources, will be transmitted via batch file extracts to the POMS central database (see attached flow chart). The data will be linked and integrated for each BH -MCO enrollee based on unique identifiers. The integrated database will provide the basis for DHS to derive quantitative performance indicators/measures that reflect systems level outcomes achieved by each BH-MCO primary contractor. The primary data sources and data collection processes are as follows: (1) UBH-MCO Encounter Data U- BH- MCOs, through a process similar to what DHS required for the HealthChoices PH-MCOs, will submit data files on a regular schedule to DHS. The data will be edited and then loaded into DHS's Enterprise Data Warehouse. The Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (OMHSAS) will, on a regular schedule, receive a file of all DHS accepted encounter records and will perform additional edits before loading to the POMS central database. Appendix K HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix K.1 (2) UEnrollee Eligibility and Demographic Data U- DHS will on a regular schedule move enrollee eligibility and demographic data from its Client Information System (CIS) into the Enterprise Data Warehouse. OMHSAS will subsequently pull a subset of eligibility and demographic data elements via data file extracts into the POMS central database. (3) USecondary Data U- OMHSAS will develop data exchange agreements with other state agencies, as feasible, to obtain regularly scheduled data file extracts that will be loaded into the POMS central database. Data exchanges with state agencies such as the Department of Corrections, State Police and the Department of Education are under development. (4) UConsumer/Family Satisfaction Reports U- There will be standardized measures administered by the BH-MCO. A Co-occurring Disorder (COD) question must be included on the survey and a sampling of COD consumers must be surveyed. The BH -MCO will submit reports of findings to the DHS. A survey will be conducted annually. (5) UBH-MCO Consumer Registry File U- BH- MCOs will maintain a computerized registry of their enrollees who have accessed behavioral health services. The registry is comprised of a minimum data set including clinical descriptions such as priority population and critical dates during the episode of care such as date of first service request, registration date and termination date. These data will be submitted by the BH- MCOs to the POMS central database. (6) UBH-MCO Quarterly Status File U- BH-MCOs will maintain a computerized file concerning the status of priority populations. The file will be updated on a calendar quarter basis for each enrollee in the priority population. The quarterly status file is comprised of a minimum data set including outcome measures such as vocational/educational status and independence of living arrangement. These data will be submitted by the BH- MCOs to the POMS central database on a regular schedule. (7) UPerformance Indicator Reports U- On a regular schedule, DHS will produce from the POMS central database a set of performance indicators that measure the performance of each BH - MCO consistent with the outcome dimensions outlined in the attached table of outcome measures. The performance indicator reports will be issued by DHS on a regular schedule to all relevant DHS monitoring staff, the BH-MCOs and other stakeholder groups. C. CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (CQI) PROCESS The Department encourages the BH -MCOs to implement a Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) process based upon Deming's 14-point program for managed adapted to the health care industry, and Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organization (JCAHO) guidelines. The overall process should include: Delineating the scope of the services to be monitored and improved. Identifying the important aspects of the services whose quality should be examined and improved. Appendix K HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix K.1 Identifying indicators (including but not limited to the performance indicators established by DHS) that will be used to monitor the quality, accessibility and appropriateness of the important aspects of services. Establishing thresholds (including but not limited to the thresholds established by DHS) for the review of indicators that become \"flags\" signaling the need for further analysis of the causes for the data reported to DHS. Collecting data pertaining to each indicator and comparing the aggregate level of performance with the threshold for analysis. If the threshold is not reached, further analysis may not be necessary. Initiating analyses of other important aspects of services when thresholds have been reached. Taking actions to improve the aspects of services. Reporting the findings to the organizations involved, including a report of findings to DHS on a regular schedule. Monitoring and analysis are continued in order to identify any future deficiencies in services and to improve quality. DHS monitoring staff will review the CQI reports of findings submitted by the BH- MCOs. DHS monitoring staff will provide feedback to BH-MCOs indicating: (1) Concurrence with the BH -MCOs explanation/cause of the performance indicator findings and actions proposed by the BH-MCOs to improve performance (and/or correct deficiencies); or (2) Offer alternative explanations/causes for the performance indicator findings and/or recommended alternative actions to improve performance (and/or correct deficiencies).

Screening: A formal process that is typically brief and occurs soon after the individual presents for services. The purpose of the screening process is to determine the likelihood that a person has a co-occurring disorder, not to establish the presence or specific type of disorder, but to determine the need for an assessment. (No mandated instrument) Assessment: A formal process of gathering information and engaging with the individual that enables the provider to establish the presence or absence of a co- occurring disorder that may involve clinical interviews, administration of standardized instruments, and/or review of existing information. The purpose of the assessment is to establish the existence of a clinical disorder or service need and to work with the individual to develop a treatment plan. (No mandated instrument) Specific reporting criteria: (unduplicated count, quarterly review and annual report) (1) Increase the percentage of network providers that routinely screen and assess for co- occurring mental health and substance use disorders: Total number of network providers: Number of network providers that have a written policy/procedure requiring individuals to be screened and assessed for co-occurring disorders: Total number of individuals screened and/or assessed for a co-occurring disorder: (2) Increase identification of co-occurring recipients (prevalence): Per Network provider: Total number of individuals admitted to the program: Total number of individuals determined to have a co-occurring disorder that have been admitted to the program: Total number of individuals determined to have a co-occurring disorder referred to another treatment provider: Appendix L Page 1 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix L GUIDELINES FOR CONSUMER/FAMILY SATISFACTION TEAMS AND MEMBER SATISFACTION SURVEYS The Department of Human Services (DHS) values and encourages the input of consumers and families in all aspects of the HealthChoices Program and expects that such input will be incorporated in quality improvement. In addition the Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (OMHSAS) encourages input from consumers, persons in recovery, and families regarding the services and supports received in the mental health and drug and alcohol service system. Consumer and family feedback helps inform Providers, counties and Behavioral Health Managed Care Organizations (BH- MCO) about how services can support recovery for adults, resilience in children and adolescents and be more effective. Consumers and families have specialized knowledge and sensitivity about how respect, dignity and responsiveness of services can affect the process of recovery and preserve resilience. Members are more likely to feel safe in describing their experience with someone who is not their service Provider. Soliciting feedback on satisfaction with services empowers consumers and families and allows them to have a greater role in determining the quality of behavioral health care and recommending system improvements DHS therefore requires Primary Contractors to implement a comprehensive approach for the measurement of consumer/family satisfaction, including but not limited to: A Consumer/Family Satisfaction Team (C/FST) Program An Annual Mailed/Telephonic Survey of Member Satisfaction A. CONSUMER and FAMILY SATISFACTION TEAM PROGRAM 1. Purpose The purpose of the C/FST Program is to determine whether adult behavioral health service recipients and children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance and/or substance abuse disorders and their families are satisfied with services and to help ensure that problems related to service access, delivery and outcome are identified and resolved in a timely manner. Surveys should identify consumer and family member satisfaction with the services of a specific Provider as well as the level of satisfaction with the behavioral health system and all of the treatment, services and supports each consumer is receiving. This is primarily accomplished by gathering information through face- to-face discussions with Recipients of behavioral health services and the families of child and adolescent service Recipients, with follow -up reports, dialogue, and problem resolution feedback with the Primary Contractor. Appendix L Page 2 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix L It is the responsibility of the Primary Contractor (the Primary Contractor refers to the responsible party that holds the HealthChoices contract or agreement with DHS) to provide the support, encouragement, and resources necessary to build a strong, independent, conflict free C/FST Program. In a recovery oriented service system support and encouragement would be evidenced by a Primary Contractor that: Communicates the importance of listening to and acting upon the results of satisfaction feedback from C/FSTs; Supports and encourages C/FSTs so that they are considered a respected and valuable service; Requires timely Provider action in response to survey results; Has a Provider network that works in partnership with C/FSTs to continuously improve service responsiveness using survey results in their internal quality management program; Identifies system improvement needed based on survey results; Actively provides direction and feedback to C/FSTs about how to improve their program and acquire the skills needed to move toward the independent operation of a satisfaction survey program; and Provides the resources necessary to accomplish the requirements outlined in this document. 2. Organizational Requirements of Consumer/Family Satisfaction Team Programs In order to determine whether or not behavioral health services are meeting the needs and expectations of adults, young adults, children and adolescents and their family members, the Primary Contractor shall ensure that the C/FST Program is organized and operates in compliance with the following: The Primary Contractor either directly, or via a BH-MCO or other sub- contractor, must have systems and procedures to routinely assess service Recipient satisfaction. The C/FST Program may be either a single or a multi -county program based upon the nature of the contract between DHS and the Primary Contractors. The family satisfaction component may be accomplished either as a separate administrative entity or as a component of the C/FST Program that is specifically responsible for family satisfaction activities. a. The Primary Contractor for HealthChoices and/or the BH-MCO must have a contract or a written and signed agreement with each C/FST Program and fiduciary, if applicable, that delineates roles and responsibilities of all parties. Designation of who holds the responsibility for advocacy and follow -up on behalf of Members should also be included. Appendix L Page 3 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix L b. Under the contract or written agreement, and consistent with the requirements of the Mental Health Procedures Act (Chapter 5100), the C/FST members will act as agents of the Primary Contractor, and are, therefore, to have the same access to consumers and family members as the Primary Contractor and service Providers, insofar as it is necessary to perform their responsibilities. c. Each C/FST Program must have a Director who may be full or part time depending upon the size of the program. The Director must be a person who self-identifies as a consumer, person in recovery, or family member as stated in 3(a) and (b) as of January 1, 2005. If the current Director hired prior to January 1, 2005 does not meet this requirement, he or she may continue to serve until such time as the position is vacant and a new Director is hired. d. C/FST members must be paid at least as much as other persons in the general workforce doing similar work in the same community. e. C/FSTs must be independent from any Provider of behavioral health services or any other agency that might create a conflict of interest. C/FSTs that do not have accounting capabilities may contract with a provider as its fiduciary provided the contract safeguards the independence of the C/FST for program direction including budget priorities, satisfaction surveys, findings and recommendations. f. The Primary Contractor shall work with the C/FST to establish an annual plan for conducting face- to-face interviews. The plan will include goals such as: the number of interviews to be completed, the levels of care to be surveyed and special focus surveys to address specifically identified special populations. If the C/FST Program identifies barriers to accessing Members to be surveyed, the Primary Contractor will assist to resolve the issue. Priority populations should be given priority for face -to-face interviews. g. The Primary Contractor will ensure that the C/FST Program has adequate financial resources, training, support, and necessary equipment for the program to produce high quality quarterly reports. 3. Consumer and Family Satisfaction Team Minimum Requirements a. Persons performing adult satisfaction activities must be, or have been, consumers of behavioral health services, persons in recovery, or family members. Appendix L Page 4 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix L b. Persons performing family satisfaction activities must include family members of children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance and/or substance abuse disorders who are receiving or have received behavioral health services in the publicly funded system, and may also include older adolescents and/or young adults who are receiving or have received behavioral health services as a child or adolescent in the publicly funded system. c. Family satisfaction team members must have child abuse and criminal history clearances in accordance with the Child Protective Services Law, Chapter 63, Sections 6303 and 6344, and are mandated reporters for child abuse. d. The family satisfaction component may be a separate and distinct administrative entity, or may be at least one team of a C/FST Program or one member of a team dedicated to family satisfaction activities. e. Young adults (18-22) may be interviewed by either consumer or family satisfaction team members, as appropriate, depending on the services being received. 4. Conducting Satisfaction Surveys Consumer and family satisfaction interviews serve as a means for early identification and resolution of problems related to service access, and timeliness of service delivery, appropriateness of services and recovery and resilience outcomes. Face- to-face interviews afford Members the opportunity to communicate openly with peers on an on-going basis. Additionally, satisfaction surveys assist in determining the level of satisfaction with respect, dignity and hopefulness as integral components of the entire service delivery system. These activities also provide a further check to ensure that the service system is consistent with the principles of recovery in adults, resilience in children and adolescents, of the Community Support Program (CSP), the Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP), cultural competence, and Drug and Alcohol (D&A) Treatment Principles. The Primary Contractor shall ensure: a. Consumer/family satisfaction should be assessed through face- to-face interviews with adult behavioral health service Recipients; children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance and/or substance abuse disorders and their families. Interviews should be face- to-face whenever possible however, telephone or mailed surveys may be used if preferred by the Member. Appendix L Page 5 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix L b. The Primary Contractor shall establish mechanisms in their contract or written agreement to inform the C/FST Program of newly enrolled Members receiving behavioral health services and on-going Members who may wish to participate in satisfaction interviews. The first mechanism below is to be used when membe r names, addresses and telephone numbers are provided to the C/FST. The second mechanism describes the process if the Primary Contractor does not wish Member names to be provided to the C/FST without Member consent. It is the Primary Contractors responsibility to select the mechanisms for notifying Members about the C/FST Program as follows: i. The Primary Contractor periodically provides the names and addresses of Members newly enrolled in mental health services to the C/FST and at least annually updates the list for Members who continue to remain enrolled, and notifies Members receiving drug and alcohol services as stated in 4 (b) ii below; or ii. The Primary Contractor informs all newly enrolled Members receiving mental health and/or drug and alcohol services about the C/FST Program. The names of members receiving mental health services who wish to be interviewed can be provided to the C/FST without a release of information. Members receiving drug and/or alcohol services must sign a release of information in order for their name, address and telephone number to be provided to the C/FST. A mechanism must be established to provide an opportunity to be interviewed at least annually for Members that remain enrolled in mental health and drug and alcohol services. c. Service Providers must provide C/FSTs with comfortable private space for interviews to ensure an environment in which behavioral health consumers and children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance and/or substance abuse disorders and their families feel free to express any concerns they may have. d. C/FSTs solicit input from Recipients of behavioral health services and the families of children and adolescents receiving behavioral health services in order that satisfaction and areas of concern can be identified and recommendations for systems improvement can be developed. This can be accomplished through individual and/or group discussions, upon discharge from a service, and as focus groups with behavioral health consumers, persons in recovery, children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance and/or substance abuse disorders and their families, including visits to programs where members receive their services or to their homes. Family members may be more easily accessed when interviews are conducted by telephone. Information about the C/FST Program is best shared in face-to- face presentation with individuals or groups, however, such methods as videotapes, telephone or written material may also be used. Appendix L Page 6 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix L e. Some of the C/FST survey questions should address satisfaction with the Provider(s) and the mental health and drug and alcohol service(s) the consumer is receiving. The findings of the C/FST shall be organized to identify the Provider, or special population in the case of a focused survey for three purposes: 1) to allow the managed care organization to include C/FST information in Provider profiling, 2) to provide feedback to the individual Provider about their program, and 3) to allow the Primary Contractor (County and/or Managed Care Organization) to direct the Provider to take corrective action to address a Member concern or concerns about the Provider operation or program. The face- to-face surveys and monthly problem solving process ensure action is taken on an on-going basis and resolution for the Member is timely and responsive. Both the on-going surveys and the annual survey described in Section B can be used to identify trends that may require system improvement. f. The Primary Contractor will identify and request the C/FST to conduct outreach efforts to under -served or un-served groups of consumers and families in order to conduct satisfaction surveys and identify system improvements that will increase the access, engagement and retention of these individuals in needed behavioral health services. 5. Areas for Consumer and Family Satisfaction Team Observation and Discussion with Recipients of Behavioral Health Services and the Families of Child and Adolescent Service Recipients Consumers, persons in recovery, and families of children and adolescents shall have input into the questions asked in satisfaction surveys. The survey tool should allow identification of the Provider(s) and the service(s) provided as well as general satisfaction with the service system. Satisfaction surveys shall include but not be limited to the following areas: UBH-MCO Related Issues U: Knowledge of and satisfaction with member services Knowledge of benefits and treatment options Awareness of complaint and grievance process (and satisfaction with outcome if process was used) Satisfaction with level of dignity and respect conveyed to Members by the BH-MCO staff Appendix L Page 7 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix L UService Delivery U: Choice of Providers Satisfaction with timeliness and convenience of the service delivery system Perception of accessibility and acceptability of services (i.e., denial of preferred services, geographic, language/culture, problems resulting in discontinuation of services by Recipient) UTreatment U: Service Recipient involvement in treatment planning and decisions Child or adolescent and their family members involvement in treatment planning and decisions Perception of effectiveness/outcomes of treatment Perception of changes in quality of life as a result of treatment Satisfaction with dignity, respect and hopefulness offered during treatment Satisfaction with physical health care UOverall Satisfaction U: Degree to which services were consistent with CSP, CASSP and D&A principles, and facilitate recovery and resilience Freedom from sense of coercion or fear of retribution for Recipients of mental health services Satisfaction and comfort level with physical environment of facility or site where services were provided. Satisfaction with dignity, respect and hopefulness offered by all levels of the service system. DHS may from time to time require specific questions to be added to C/FST satisfaction surveys in order to conduct statewide quality assurance activities. 6. Confidentiality All employees of C/FST Programs must comply with applicable state and federal laws, regulations, and rules regarding the confidentiality of mental health consumers and recipients of drug and alcohol treatment services. The contract or written agreement will address confidentiality requirements including the following: a. All C/FST members must receive training in confidentiality regulations for mental health and substance abuse services. All family satisfaction team members must also receive training in confidentiality issues relevant to the child and adolescent population in both mental health and substance abuse services. Appendix L Page 8 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix L b. All C/FST members must sign a confidentiality agreement, and personnel policies must address disciplinary procedures relevant to violation of the signed confidentiality agreement. c. Mental Health Confidentiality: For purposes of the HealthChoices program, C/FSTs are agents of the Primary Contractor, and have the delegated authority to collect and disseminate the needed information. C/FST members must be considered as equal to all other mental health professionals with regard to access to mental health consumers, children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance and their families. There should be no special written permission required to engage consumers and families receiving mental health, whether in state hospitals or community programs. d. Mental Health Confidentiality: If the Recipient of mental health services is a child (up to 14 years of age), he or she may be interviewed but only in the presence of a responsible family member or authorized caregiver, and the family member or caregiver must also be interviewed. If the Recipient of mental health services is an adolescent (14 to 18 years of age), the adolescent should be interviewed independently and responsible family members or an authorized caregiver could also be offered the opportunity to be interviewed. It is preferable but not necessary to receive the adolescent's consent before interviewing family members or caregivers. e. Drug and Alcohol Confidentiality: A service agreement between the C/FST Program and each Drug and Alcohol Provider outlining Drug and Alcohol confidentiality rules, rights, regulations and laws that govern Drug and Alcohol Providers in Penns ylvania is also required. This is consistent with the current practice of Drug and Alcohol Providers to require such an agreement be signed by representatives of the Departments of Health and Human Services, Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, and Single County Authorities for Drug and Alcohol services. f. Drug and Alcohol Confidentiality: Prior to a drug and alcohol service Provider contacting a C/FST Program to provide the name of a person who wishes to be surveyed, a consent to release information form must be signed by the Member requesting their name, address and telephone number be provided to the C/FST Program. A copy of the signed consent to release information form must be retained in the Member's treatment file and a copy given to the Member and the C/FST. Consent to release information forms for Members receiving drug and alcohol treatment services are not required when the C/FST conducts surveys without receiving the persons name and re ports data in the aggregate Appendix L Page 9 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix L g. Drug and Alcohol Confidentiality: Recipients of drug and alcohol treatment services, regardless of age, must give their written consent for a parent or other family member to be interviewed, or to be present while the Recipient of services is being interviewed. h. C/FSTs must be afforded the opportunity to meet with mental health consumers and Recipients of substance abuse services and the family members of child and adolescent service Recipients to describe and explain the purpose and function of C/FSTs. 7. Problem Identification and Recommendations for Action C/FSTs must provide feedback to the Primary Contractor through written quarterly reports and monthly problem resolution meetings that allow for dialogue and review of findings. The Primary Contractor is responsible for timely reports back to the C/FST on specific actions and problem resolution resulting from identified issues, concerns and problems. The contract or written agreement shall identify the process the Primary Contractor will use to resolve problems and address suggestions identified by the C/FST including the following: a. Process for problem identification and resolution that includes the C/FST Program, consumers, persons in recovery, parents, adolescents, children, designated county staff, staff of the managed care organization, and advocates as appropriate to the problem identified. b. The problem resolution process must include how often problem resolution meetings will occur, with whom, and the responsibilities of all parties (County, C/FST, managed care organization, and Providers). This process will identify actions to be taken by the Primary Contactor if resolution is not reached. There must also be a process in place for responding to urgent matters identified by Members. c. The Managed Care Organization sub-contracts with Providers of behavioral health services in their network shall include the timeframe in which the Provider must respond to the recommendations made by the C/FST as directed by the County, Managed Care Organization or the C/FST. Providers of behavioral health services should be required to use C/FST feedback in their quality management program. d. The Primary Contractor must provide a timely response to the C/FST on actions taken in response to reported problems and concerns resulting from service Recipient interviews for inclusion in the next quarterly report. Appendix L Page 10 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix L e. Mechanisms must be in place to address identified trends or system changes that may require the Primary Contractor to study in more depth to understand the issue and resolve. This may include focus meetings on specific topics or collaboration with other involved service systems. The results of these focus studies will be provided to the C/FST for inclusion in their reports. 8. Knowledge, Training and Orientation of Consumer and Family Satisfaction Teams The Primary Contractor will ensure that C/FST members have both an initial orientation to and on- going training in the following areas: a. C/FST members must have basic knowledge of mental illness and addictive diseases and an understanding of the concept of recovery and resilience in relation to both for adults and children and adolescents. Persons performing Family Satisfaction activities must also have an understanding of serious emotional disturbance and substance abuse disorders in children and adolescen ts. b. Training for C/FST members must include confidentiality regulations for mental health and substance abuse services. Family satisfaction team members must also receive training in confidentiality issues relevant to the child and adolescent population in both mental health and substance abuse services. Training must include an understanding of responsibilities, as applicable, under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). c. C/FST members must also have an understanding of the cultural diversity of the individual and community being served in order to ensure culturally sensitive interactions. Training shall include the basic concepts of recovery and resilience. d. Family satisfaction team members must have training in the responsibilities of being mandated reporters for child abuse. e. The Primary Contractor shall arrange a minimum of two (2) hours orientation/training on the BH-MCO operations, policies and procedures for satisfaction team members. 9. Quarterly Reports The Primary Contractor shall provide the Department with the C/FST Program's quarterly report summarizing consumer and family satisfaction findings, as well as improvement actions and system changes implemented by the Primary Contractor in response to those findings. The Primary Contractor shall provide support and direction to the C/FST to ensure the report contains not only the Appendix L Page 11 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix L numeric results of surveys conducted but also information about the actions taken in the previous quarter by the Primary Contractor or behavioral health service Provider, trends observed, and other relevant information that can be used by Providers and others about ways to improve treatment and supports. 10. DHS Annual Review of Consumer/Family Satisfaction Team Programs DHS will conduct an annual review of the C/FST program that will include a review of the following: a. Results of satisfaction surveys; b. Actions taken to resolve identified issues and system changes; c. Role and effectiveness of the Primary Contractor in problem resolution and direction to the C/FST program; d. Adequacy of the budget, staff, and training opportunities to carry out the requirements of the program; e. Role of the fiduciary, if applicable, in supporting the program and financial priorities established by the C/FST program; and f. Progress on gaining skills and abilities of the C/FST program to move toward operating as an independent, conflict free, satisfaction program, as applicable B. ANNUAL MEMBER SATISFACTION SURVEYS 1. Consumer and Family Satisfaction Annual Mailed/Telephonic Survey The Primary Contractor is responsible for ensuring that an annual satisfaction survey of a representative sample of persons served by the behavioral health program is conducted by mail or telephonically. The purpose of the Annual Mailed/Telephonic Consumer and Family Member Satisfaction Survey is to determine the extent to which the BH-MCO adult Members and family members of children and adolescents are satisfied with overall BH-MCO operations and services, and to identify areas which need improvement. Surveys are developed and used by the BH-MCO to gather information to determine whether the BH- MCO adult Members and family members of children and adolescents are knowledgeable about and satisfied with the behavioral health program including core functions such as member services as well as to assess whether service availability, service access, and services provision and effectiveness are meeting the Member's needs and expectations. Appendix L Page 12 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix L a. Surveys of Recipients of substance abuse services, regardless of age, must be distributed by Providers at service delivery sites in order to protect the confidentiality of persons being surveyed. b. A separate survey instrument must be developed for children and adolescent service Recipients and their families. c. Findings and resulting recommendations from the survey and consumer/family satisfaction activities are to be incorporated into the Primary Contractor's ongoing quality management and improvement program. d. The County may directly conduct the annual survey or direct the managed care organization, C/FST Program, or another entity that would be conflict free, to conduct the annual survey. 2. Areas Covered by the Consumer and Family Satisfaction Survey Consumers, persons in recovery, and families of children and adolescents shall have input into the questions asked in satisfaction surveys. Satisfaction surveys shall include but not be limited to the following areas: UBH-MCO Related Issues U: Knowledge of and satisfaction with member services Knowledge of benefits and treatment options Awareness of complaint and grievance process (and satisfaction with outcome if process was used) Satisfaction with level of dignity and respect conveyed to Members by the BH-MCO staff UService Delivery U: Choice of Providers Satisfaction with timeliness and convenience of the service delivery system Perception of accessibility and acceptability of services (i.e., denial of preferred services, geographic, language/culture, problems resulting in discontinuation of services by Recipient) UTreatment U: Service Recipient involvement in treatment planning and decisions Child or adolescent and their family Members involvement in treatment planning and decisions Perception of effectiveness/outcomes of treatment Perception of changes in quality of life as a result of treatment Satisfaction with digni ty, respect and hopefulness offered during treatment Satisfaction with physical health care. Appendix L Page 13 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix L UOverall Satisfaction U: Degree to which services were consistent with CSP, CASSP and D&A principles, and facilitate recovery and resilience Freedom from sense of coercion or fear of retribution for Recipients of mental health services Satisfaction and comfort level with physical environment of facility or site where services were provided.

UMiscellaneous U: Items required by the Department as a result of the Department's ongoing monitoring and program evaluation. Knowledge of and satisfaction with the Medical Assistance Transportation Program Satisfaction of consumers with special needs e.g. deaf and hard of hearing, older adults, people who are homeless, etc. Suggestions for improvement 3. Sampling Procedure The Annual Mailed/Telephonic Consumer and Family Satisfaction Survey must be sent to, or conducted with, a representative sample of behavioral health service Recipients with a statistically valid sampling of Members in the adult priority population groups, family members of child and adolescent service Recipients, and special needs populations, as well as a sampling of Members who filed complaints and grievances. The survey of Members receiving drug and alcohol services must be anonymously distributed through service Providers. 4. Frequency of Survey and Reporting Results A report of the survey findings and resulting recommendations for quality improvement must be submitted to the Department as part of the annual quality management summary report, quality management plan for the upcoming year.

Appendix N Page 1 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix N HealthChoices Behavioral Health Program Requirements for County Reinvestment Plans Primary Contractors in the HealthChoices program, including those behavioral health managed care organizations (BH- MCOs) under direct contract with the Department of Human Services (DHS), are allowed to retain Capitation revenues and investment income that was not expended during the Agreement period to reinvest in programs and services in their County. These funds, called Reinvestment Funds, must be spent in accordance with a DHS, Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (OMHSAS) approved reinvestment plan. Reinvestment Funds provide a unique opportunity for a financial incentive to reward sound financial management practices and allow the creative use of funds to fill identified gaps in the service system, test new innovative treatment approaches, address social determinants of health and develop cost-effective alternatives to traditional services that may create cost offsets for State Plan Services. Reinvestment is one mechanism used to achieve the Commonwealth's expectation for the continuous quality improvement of a comprehensive treatment system that not only supports recovery for persons with mental health issues, including drug and/or alcohol treatment needs, but for the family support structure as well. This document refers to both the reinvestment plan and reinvestment plan priorities. This document describes the required planning process, allowable expenditures, financial reporting, and the approval process for Primary Contractors to use Reinvestment Funds. The term \"plan\" refers to the entire reinvestment submission for the Agreement year. The \"reinvestment plan priorities\" are the individually named projects that are numbered in priority order and submitted with a program description. Further details related to these requirements are found in the following documents: HealthChoices Behavioral Health Program Stand ards & Requirements (PSR), the HealthChoices Behavioral Health Agreement, and the UFinancial Reporting Requirements - HealthChoices Behavioral U UHealth Program. A. Planning for Reinvestment Funds Involvement of Stakeholders 1. The planning process must include and document the involvement of members of the BH-MCO who have received or are currently receiving services, families (including families of children and adolescents), persons in recovery, MH/ID and Single County Authorities (SCA), and as appropriate, County Commissioners and local legislators. 2. In order for stakeholders to provide informed feedback about options for Reinvestment Funds, the County and BH-MCO should present the results of data analysis performed to document utilization trends, unmet needs, populations served, outcomes achieved by the HealthChoices program to date, etc. as part of Appendix N Page 2 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix N the planning process in the development of the reinvestment plan. Stakeholders must be involved at all stages of the planning and decision -making process. Evidence of their involvement and feedback must be summarized as part of the plan submission. 3. Counties must document the planning process used at the local level to discuss behavioral health service needs. 4. Preliminary reinvestment plans should be discussed with the OMHSAS Field Office for input regarding planned use of funds prior to submission. Timeframes for Submission and Approval 1. The timeframes for submission and approval are provided as approximate dates. The dates provided are the outside dates for when submission is required. Primary Contractors may submit plans prior to the completion of the audit using estimates of the Reinvestment Funds available. Submission timeframes are calculated from the beginning and ending dates of the annual Agreement. Dates for review and approval may vary depending on any additional information or clarification needed. The review process is summarized below, and detailed steps are provided in Attachment 1. 2. UReinvestment Funds U are determined annually based on the agreement year. UReinvestment plans U may be submitted for funds available in the previous agreement year or unspent funds from prior agreement year . 3. Draft plans are submitted to the OMHSAS Field Office for review and comment once the amount of Reinvestment Funds are identified and confirmed by OMHSAS. This should be no later than the first day of the ninth (9th) month after the end of the Agreement year. 4. The OMHSAS Field Office provides written feedback to the Primary Contractor. 5. Final reinvestment plans are to be submitted within thirty (30) days of receiving OMHSAS feedback. 6. The Service System Review Committee (SSRC) reviews and approves final reinvestment plans. If there are questions, the questions are provided to the Primary Contractor. Once the Primary Contractor satisfactorily responds to the questions by providing the requested additional information and/or submitting a revised plan, written approval will be provided. 7. The Primary Contractor cannot begin implementing the approved reinvestment plan until written notification is received that the plan is approved and the funds to support the plan have been deposited into a restricted account as required (within thirty (30) days of plan approval). 8. If in a subsequent year, Reinvestment Funds are intended to be used to continue funding for a previously approved reinvestment plan priority, the Primary Contractor must submit the previously approved plan with updated financial information related to the request for continuation funding. There should be evidence that stakeholders continue to support the plan priority and evidence of the benefit from implementing the priority. OMHSAS will expedite the review of the plan. 9. When additional funds are identified, plans must be submitted no later than twelve Appendix N Page 3 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix N (12) months from the date additional Reinvestment Funds are identified. The new plans will be reviewed at the time they are received following the same process described above. Exceeding this timeframe for submission may result in the DHS recovery of these funds. B. Identification of Reinvestment Funds 1. Primary Contractors confirm the amount of Reinvestment Funds available with OMHSAS. Written confirmation should be received, by the middle of the (8th) month after the end of the Agreement year, in order to meet the above timeframes. Once the available funds are confirmed, then the draft reinvestment plans may be submitted. The amount of reinve stment money available is subject to change based on future reconciliation. 2. For reinvestment purposes only, adjustments made to prior year available funds two (2) years after submission of the Agreement audit will be applied to the most recent audited Agreement year. 3. A reinvestment plan must be submitted for approval within twelve (12) months of the time additional funds are identified for reinvestment. C. Guidance on the Use of Reinvestment Funds Allowable Uses for Reinvestment Funds 1. Start- up costs for State Plan Services for capacity building, including provider assistance. Any unmet service access standards should be considered for reinvestment funds as a priority. Any billable State Plan Services must be submitted to the BH-MCO for payment during the start-up of the service. 2. Development and/or purchase of Medical Assistance (MA) eligible in lieu of or in addition to services. 3. Behavioral health supports that are not MA eligible (non -medical ) such as purchase or renovation of a facility, employment supports, housing development, or rental subsidies or other services or items that improve social determinants of health . 4. To m itigate the negative impact s on social determinants of health including in the areas of hous ing, employment, and food security. Other areas may be identified and include d in reinvestment plans as well. 5. Training and consultation that is required to implement a new service or support for MA eligible individuals. 6. Expenditures must be consistent with the conditions of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) waiver, the HealthChoices PSR and Agreement. Reinvestment Funds Cannot be used for: 1. Incentives payment to a BH- MCO. 2. Payment of State Plan Services. 3. Administrative costs such as medical management, quality management activities, outcome studies, etc. Appendix N Page 4 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix N 4. Training not connected to the development of a specific service or program (see Allowable Expenditures for Training) detailed below. 5. Transportation costs that are available under the Medical Assistance Transportation Program (MATP). 6. Services targeted primarily for non-Medical Assistance (MA) eligible persons or to the community at large. 7. Expenditures that do not comply with the UReview and Approval Guidelines for U UReinvestment Plans that Provide for Costs for Facility or Real Estate Purchase, U URenovation or Purchase of Fixed Assets U(Attachment 5). Allowable Expenditures for Training Training is an important component of any new service. In developing a budget as part of a reinvestment plan, the training component should be identified in the overall budget of the service. The training must be tied to a new service and not a stand - alone budget item. For example, if the Primary Contractor has determined that there is a need for a Mental Illness Substance Abuse (MISA) program, Reinvestment Funds could be allocated to cover the costs of training for the implementation of this program. However, if the Primary Contractor decided that they would like to train all County staff in MISA \"best practice,\" the Primary Contractor would need to use administrative dollars to fund this training since it is not tied to a specific program developed to provide services targeted for MA eligible consumers. Allowable Expenditures for Purchase, Renovation and Fixed Assets 1. The reinvestment plan must address additional information specified in the UReview and Approval Guidelines for Reinvestment Plans that Provide for Costs U Ufor Facility or Real Estate Purchase, Renovation or Purchase of Fixed Assets U (Attachment 5) when a plan priority includes these Non-Medical services or supports. These guidelines specify the additional information that must be included in the reinvestment plan priority submitted and in the agreement entered into between the Primary Contractor and Subcontractor. These include: A. Additional areas that must be addressed in the reinvestment plan description regarding ownership, analysis of the need for Non-Medical Services, availability of an on-going revenue source, etc. B. A detailed budget of the costs associated with purchase of a facility or property, renovation, fixed assets, personnel, operating expenses, etc. must be submitted following the guidelines in Attachment 5. C. The Primary Contractor/Provider Agreement should ensure that if the property is sold that any proceeds from the sale would be returned to the Primary Contractor. In this case a new reinvestment plan for these funds must be submitted within twelve (12) months or the funds will be considered Discretionary Funds which must be returned to the Department. Appendix N Page 5 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix N D. Costs for Non- Medical Services are not considered in the HealthChoices rate setting process and DHS has no obligation to continue to fund priorities that were approved as one-time expenditures for the purchase or renovation of a facility. D. OMHSAS Plan Parameters Format for Submission of Reinvestment Plans 1. The reinvestment plan must be submitted in accordance with OMHSAS established parameters. 2. A standardized format for submission of both the draft and final reinvestment plan is provided in Attachment 3. Each reinvestment plan priority for the Agreement year must be numbered in priority order and must be submitted on a separate form using this format. The same priority number based on the Agreement year must always be used on all reports to facilitate tracking. One (1) set of budget forms must be submitted listing each reinvestment plan by priority number (Attachment 4). 3. The reinvestment plan title is to include the Primary Contractor 's name and agreement year from which the funds are identified as available for reinvestment. 4. The reinvestment plan priority format identifies the: Primary Contractor; the date of submission; the type of service to be funded (State Plan -start-up, In Lieu Of, In Addition To, or Non-Medical Only); indicate if it is a new, continuation, or amended plan and indicate the numeric priority assignment of the reinvestment plan. 5. Reinvestment plan priorities can include expenditures up to five (5) years, subject to SSRC approval, with the exception of State Plan Start- up which should be completed within six (6) months, up to a maximum o f one (1) year. 6. Each reinvestment plan priority must state the Agreement years in which Reinvestment Funds will be spent. Primary Contractors should include realistic dates for expenditure to avoid having to request an extension. 7. When determining the Agreement year in which the reinvestment plan priority funds will be spent, the Primary Contractor should consider the time it will take to accomplish the plan priority and the date of OMHSAS approval. If the time to approve the plan priority was delayed, the final date for spending may need to be adjusted. 8. Expenditures for a reinvestment plan priority cannot be incurred until the effective date of the OMHSAS approval letter. 9. OMHSAS reserves the right to request additional information, if necessary, in order to approve a reinvestment plan priority. Target Population 1. The reinvestment plan must identify that it is targeted for the unmet or under -met needs of mental health and drug and alcohol MA eligible individuals. 2. The reinvestment plan must describe in detail the population that is targeted for Appendix N Page 6 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix N the reinvestment plan priority (e.g. adults with serious mental illness, adolescents with drug and alcohol treatment needs, etc.). It must also include an estimat e of the number of persons that will be served by the reinvestment plan priority. 3. It is understood that some non-MA eligible consumers may receive services in a program established to target MA eligible members. DHS assures that the federal funds flowing to the counties under the HC BH Agreement will be used to provide services that primarily benefit MA beneficiaries.. Description of Program or Service 1. Reinvestment plans must include a detailed narrative description of each program or service that is consistent with and supports the definition of the service as being either State Plan start -up, Services in lieu of, in addition to or Non-Medical Only. 2. Describe the program or service to be funded by the reinvestment plan priority and why this service or approach is expected to improve the health outcomes for the persons targeted. Evidenced Based Practice Models should be considered for inclusion in a reinvestment plan. 3. If a Primary Contractor is requesting the approval of a new MA eligible in lieu of service, identify the service or services that are expected to generate cost offsets once the in lieu of service is available. Description of Fund Expenditures 1. Provide a brief summary of what the reinvestment plan priority will fund. 2. Each reinvestment plan priority must contain a description of the major budgeted items (personnel, equipment, operational costs, etc.) and the cost associated with each item. The qualifications of both training and experience for staff and a break out of each position being funded should be included in the plan. 3. If the reinvestment plan priority is funding start-up costs for a State Plan Service, list the specific start -up costs expenditures that will be funded, and the length of time start-up costs will be required e.g. six months, with a maximum of one year, of staff salaries, staff training, etc. Include an offset for estimated billable services. 4. Identify how the reinvestment plan priority will be financed for continuation once Reinvestment Funds have been expended. Sustainability must be discussed , including funding options that will be considered in the future and a descri ption of how the services will continue . If servicers will not be continued, include an explanation for why the services will end. 5. Reinvestment plan priorities with requests for Non- Medical facility, land or property purchase and/or fixed asset expenditures require submission of the specific information outlined in UReview and Approval Guidelines for U UReinvestment Plans that Provide for Costs for Facility or Real Estate Purchase, U URenovation or Purchase of Fixed Assets U(Attachment 5). Data Analysis Supporting Request 1. Include a summary of the data analysis that supports why the target population has been chosen and why the specific service has been chosen for Reinvestment Appendix N Page 7 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix N Funds. Identify the number of HC members in the target population. 2. Identify the outcomes to be achieved by the service and the data to be collected to measure the outcomes. 3. For continuation or expansion requests , the outcome data and any findings need to be included with the submission , as well as any updates or changes to the services being implemented. Description of Stakeholder Involvement in Decision Making 1. Requests must summarize stakeholder involvement in the planning and decision - making process for each request. 2. It is expected that stakeholders will be provided information about the outcomes achieved by the HealthChoices program to date. This might include the current strengths and opportunities for improvement as seen by the County and BH- MCO. Such information will allow stakeholders to provide informed feedback about priorities for Reinvestment Funds . Reinvestment Budget Forms 1. Four (4) budget forms must be submitted which break out costs based on eligibility category for HealthChoices recipients, MA recipients, Non-MA recipients and total expenditures. One set of budget forms is to be completed, listing each reinvestment plan priority submitted (Attachment 4). 2. Primary Contractors should use their best estimates to determine the number of clients in each of these three (3) categories. It is understood that members move in and out of eligibility categories. E. Financial Requirements for Reinvestment Funds 1. Primary Contractors must place Reinvestment Funds in a separate restricted account. Bank statements for the account must be submitted monthly. Bank statements are to be reconciled monthly. 2. Reinvestment Funds can be deposited when identified but must be placed in a restricted account within thirty (30) days of the OMHSAS written approval of the reinvestment plan(s). 3. Report #12 UReinvestment Report Uis the format used for the monthly report as outlined in the UFinancial Reporting Requirements -HealthChoices Behavioral U UHealth Program Udocument (Attachment 6, updated annually). 4. Report #12 must be prepared on a cash-basis (report deposits and payments in the month in which they occur). No accruals for services should be reflected in this report. 5. A separate report is required for HealthChoices recipients and for Other, non- HealthChoices or non-identifiable recipients. 6. Expenses are to be reported for HealthChoices recipients and for Other, non- HealthChoices or non-identifiable recipients. If it is not possible to report expenses for HealthChoices recipients and for Other, non- HealthChoices or non-identifiable recipients and the expenses must be allocate d an allocat ion Appendix N Page 8 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix N methodology must be submitted to DHS for approval. 7. If Reinvestment Funds from more than one (1) Agreement year are being utilized, a separate set of reports must be filled out for each Agreement year's Reinvestment Funds. 8. Interest earned from the reinvestment account must be reported on Report #12. Expenditures of interest earned must be consistent with an approved plan. 9. Funds must be withdrawn from the reinvestment account in accordance with a plan approved by OMHSAS. No funds can be distributed, or expenditures incurred, prior to the date of the OMHSAS approval letter. 10. Primary Contractors must return any unexpended Reinvestment Funds to DHS within six (6) months of the date by which funds were approved to be spent, unless the timefra me for expenditure of these funds was extended by OMHSAS. After that time, unexpended Reinvestment Funds must be returned to DHS. 11. In the event the Agreement with the Department ends and is not renewed, all funds, except for those in DHS approved reinvestment plans, or Reinvestment Funds in a plan submitted to DHS but which DHS has not taken a positive or negative action, remaining in the Primary Contractor's Special Revenue Fund or Enterprise Fund, or held by any Subcontractor, inclusive of Risk and Contingency Funds, not expended for the HC BH transaction, must be returned to the Department within fourteen (14) months from the expiration of the Agreement. Funds identified in a reinvestment plan submitted to DHS, but on which DHS has not taken a positive or negative action, are not considered Discretionary Funds. F. Modifications to Approved Reinvestment Plans 1. Proposed changes or modifications to an approved reinvestment plan priority must be submitted in writing. Written confirmation of approval of a change will be issued by OMHSAS within the approval timelines described below. 2. Changes may include a request to: extend the timeframe for expenditure of funds, revise the approved program, withdraw an approved plan and propose a new plan for use of the funds, or change the amount of expenditure when approval of such a change is required. 3. A request for an extension of an approved reinvestment plan (numbered by priority) must be received forty -five (45) days prior to the end of the final agreement expenditure year stated on the OMHSAS reinvestment approval letter and must indicate the reason for the extension. OMHSAS will provide a written response to a request for extension. Failure to meet this 45 -day requirement may result in DHS's recovery of the Reinvestment F unds. 4. If program or service plan modifications are requested after a reinvestment plan priority has been approved by OMHSAS, the Primary Contractor must use the same format (Attachment 3) to submit a request for change. Stakeholder involvement, and documentation of such, must occur if a new reinvestment plan priority is being proposed to substitute for a previously approved priority. 5. Any revisions to the amount approved for an individual reinvestment plan priority which is the greater of twenty -five percent (25%) or $50,000 for the priority being revised, must be approved by OMHSAS in advance. Examples include: Appendix N Page 9 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix N a. A plan has been approved for $100,000. The Primary Contractor wishes to decrease the plan by $40,000. This change could be made without approval since the greater of 25% or $50,000 has not been exceeded, or; b. A plan is approved for $1M. The county wishes to increase the plan by $300,000. This change would have to be approved since the change is the greater than 25% (25% equals $250,000). 6. The UReinvestment Report -Budget Uforms (Attachment 4) will be used to track approved changes for expenditures and reinvestment plan priorities from an agreement year. G. Annual Report on HealthChoices Reinvestment Plans 1. Submission of an UAnnual Report on HealthChoices Reinvestment Plans Ufor approved reinvestment plans from the previous agreement year and those plan priorities that continue to be funded with reinvestment dollars is required. The annual report of Reinvestment Funds is to include a program summary for each reinvestment plan priority that continues to be funded with reinvestment dollars. 2. The UAnnual Report on HealthChoices Reinvestment Plans Uis due on the last day of the thirteenth (13th) month from the end of the agreement year. The required format for submission is attached (Attachment 7). An updated budget is required to be submitted annually. 3. OMHSAS provides a summary of all approved reinvestment plans to stakeholders.

Page 1 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix N, Attachment 5 Appendix N, Attachment 5 Review and Approval Guidelines for Reinvestment Plans that Provide for Costs for Facility or Real Estate Purchase, Renovation or Purchase of Fixed Assets All reinvestment plan priorities containing costs for facility or real estate purchase, renovation, housing development, vehicle acquisition, and/or purchase of fixed assets must adhere to these Reinvestment Plan Guidelines and applicable provisions of the local County Code. UReinvestment Plan Submission: Conditions that apply to reinvestment plan priorities that contain costs for facility or real estate purchase, renovation, housing development, vehicle acquisition, and or purchase of fixed assets are: 1. Primary purpose of the reinvestment plan priority must be to serve MA eligible individual s with mental health and/or drug and alcohol treatment service needs. 2. The reinvestment plan priorities must contain a statement of the rationale for the development of the program and related capital costs. 3. The reinvestment plan priority must explain the financial strategy for acquiring the property, facility or vehicle and why that method is cost effective. Identify whether the facility or vehicle will be purchased or leased or if facility costs be built into the service rate. Each Primary Contractor will describe the housing capital development strategy and why acquisition by a housing organization is cost effective from a housing finance perspective. The housing development strategy shall also specify the following: amount of reinvestment resources budgeted, types of rental housing (e.g. new construction or rehabilitation), and plan to administer the housing development funds. 4. The reinvestment plan priority must summarize the ownership arrangement between the Primary Contractor and provider and specify the party that holds title to fixed assets. Identify related parties when there is common ownership. Provide a detailed data analysis supporting the request as part of the reinvestment plan. The data analysis must support the need for the project proposed. The analysis should include, for example, analysis of the provider network demonstrating a gap in service, rationale for cost effectiveness of the purchase, description of underserved target population to be served, etc. Page 2 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix N, Attachment 5 Appendix N, Attachment 5 5. The Primary Contractor may enter an agreement to provide capital resources with a qualified housing organization in exchange for the set-aside of specific number of rental units for MA eligible consumers protected by a long term use restriction. The ownership arrangement for any capital development for supportive housing should identify the property to be acquired or replaced, number of set-aside units within the overall development that the county will have priority access over a specified period of time, how consumer access will be assured, the affordability of the rents to be paid by the MA eligible consumer, how the Primary Contractor will be reimbursed or be assured that the use restriction for these set -aside units remains in place in the event the property goes into foreclosure or the owner violates the terms of the agreement or the use restriction. Rental subsidies assigned to these set-aside rental units to ensure affordability for a specified period of time can be considered in exchange for investment based on a financial analysis that the exchange is of like or greater value. 6. The reinvestment plan priority must include a budget in sufficient detail to demonstrate how the amount identified in the reinvestment plan priority request was determined. This should include budgeted items (e.g. personnel, equipment, operating costs, transportation, repairs, etc.) and associated costs as well as any pertinent assumptions. 7. The reinvestment plan priority must contain information about the source of operating funds for the continuation of the program or service after one-time reinvestment plan funds are expended. For housing development plans, identify the number of units that will be available for a specified period of time. If the Primary Contractor intends to retain a housing agency to administer the housing development funds on their behalf, the reinvestment plan must include detailed information on the Primary Contractor's selection process, the selection criteria to be used, the administrator's duties/responsibilities, and the expected administrative fee to be paid to the administrator. 8. Purchase of vehicles is not permitted for transportation to MA services of MA eligible members otherwise served by the Medical Assistance Transportation Program (MATP). Page 3 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix N, Attachment 5 Appendix N, Attachment 5 UPrimary Contracto r-Provider Reinvestment Plan Agreement: Any agreement entered into between the Primary Contractor and a provider for the purpose of implementing a reinvestment plan priority, which contains costs for facility or real estate purchase, renovation, vehicle acquisition, and/or purchase of fixed assets, must: 1. Be reduced to writing 2. Be targeted to Medical Assistance eligible individuals with mental health and/or drug and alcohol service needs. For a housing development strategy Medical Assistance eligible individual s must be included as a priority population for housing services. 3. Assure that the acquisition or renovation is likely to be used in the HC program for at least five years and be subject to specified disposition requirements. 4. Identify any related parties and the relationship of the related parties regarding the accomplishment of the reinvestment plan. 5. Specify ownership rights, use of the facility, and the process for disposition of fixed assets in the event a sale should occur. For housing development funds, the funds must be secured by legally binding documents that are in acceptable forms. Such forms include but are not limited to: mortgage , promissory note, loan agreement and restrictive covenant. These legally binding housing documents will address how the restriction of use will be passed on to the future owner in the event of property transfer as well as how the Primary Contractor will be reimbursed or be assured the use restriction for the set- aside units will stay in place in the event the property goes into foreclosure or the owner violates the terms of the agreement or the use restriction. 6. In the event of a sale, proceeds from the sale are to be returned to the Primary Contractor HealthChoices program for reinvestment in programs or services for MA eligible members . This provision is not applicable to housing development plans. 7. Specify the accounting method to be used in expensing, depreciating or amortizing costs. This provision is not applicable to housing development plans . 8. Require maintenance, repair and insurance of fixed assets. In the case of a facility being purchased for housing, the Primary Contractor should specify the required maintenance and insurance of fixed assets. To ensure a property is maintained, the Primary Contractor or its designee will require or Page 4 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix N, Attachment 5 Appendix N, Attachment 5 conduct periodic inspections to ensure compliance with HUD's Housing Quality Standards (HQS). Failure of inspection may trigger foreclosure or other actions as specified by the Primary Contractor. The Primary Contractor should be named on the insurance of fixed assets to order for the County to be notified if coverage ceases and failure to maintain insurance of fixed assets can also trigger foreclosure or other action as specified by the County. 9. Require competitive bidding or written estimates as required by County Code or prudent business practices. 10. Be reviewed and approved by the County Solicitor or other appropriate County official (e.g. MH/MR legal counsel) to ensure compliance with these Reinvestment Plan Guidelines and applicable County Code provisions. 11. Contain a budget that details the costs associated with the facility renovation or purchase of fixed assets as submitted in the County's reinvestment plan priority. This provision is not applicable to housing development plans Page 1 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix N, Attachment 6a Appendix N Attachment 6a 12. UReport #12 - Reinvestment Report The purpose of this report is to monitor reinvestment activity. All approved allocations to and distributions from the reinvestment account are to be shown on this report. This report must be prepared on a cash-basis (report deposits and payments in the month in which they occur). No accruals for services should be reflected on this report. Reinvestment funds can be deposited when identified, but must be placed in a restricted account within thirty (30) days of the OMHSAS written approval of the County's reinvestment plan(s). IMPORTANT NOTE: The services reported on this report should UNOT Ube reported on Report #9. Report #9 should only reflect those medical services being provided under the current year's capitation revenue. Columns are provided for reporting the number of unduplicated recipients served, current month units of service provided and dollar amount paid for those services, as well as cumulative year to date and contract to date units of service provided and dollar amount paid. A separate report must be provided for each of the following categories of aid: 1. All HealthChoices (all HealthChoices eligible recipients) 2. Other (non- HealthChoices recipients or non-identifiable recipients) 3. Total (total of the two categories above) A methodology for allocating costs that are not attributable to a specific category of aid must be submitted and approved by DHS prior to implementation. In addition, if reinvestment funds from more than one agreement year are being utilized, a separate set of reports must be filed for each agreement year's reinvestment funds. The count of unduplicated recipients should be unduplicated by each individual reinvestment service and should reflect unduplicated recipients on a contract to date basis. The Prior Period Balance is the reinvestment account balance as of the last day of the prior calendar month for the \"Current Period\" column; the reinvestment account balance as of the last day of the prior year for the \"Year to Date\" column; and $0 for the \"Contract to Date\" column. Page 2 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix N, Attachment 6a Appendix N Attachment 6a Allocations/contributions are funds transferred into the reinvestment account. Investment Revenue is income generated by the undistributed funds retained in the reinvestment account. Reinvestment revenue represents earnings on prior year funds and should appear on Report #12 only. Approved Distributions are funds withdrawn from the reinvestment account in accordance with the DHS -approved Reinvestment Plan. A written plan for reinvestment must be submitted to and approved by DHS Uprior Uto making any distribution. Administrative costs, such as bank fees, should be reported on a separate line. Any administrative costs reported must be disclosed in detail in the footnotes to these reports. Ending Balance is the reinvestment account balance as of the end of the last day of the calendar month. The Budgeted Amount column should reflect the amounts and services contained in the DHS - approved reinvestment plan. Budgeted Investment/Interest Income should reflect either estimated interest to be earned on HealthChoices funds deposited in the reinvestment bank account and included in the Budget Forms submitted with your reinvestment plans to DHS for approval or interest earned on funds deposited in the reinvestment bank account and allocated to approved reinvestment plans. Budgeted Amounts are not required to be allocated by rating group and can be reported only on the Total page. For electronic reporting, Budgeted Amounts may be reported in total as \"Other\". The HealthChoices Behavioral Health Program Requirements for County Reinvestment Plans requires that revisions to an individual reinvestment plan priority, which are the greater of twenty -five percent (25%) or $50,000 for the priority being revised, be approved by OMHSAS in advance. Revisions less than the preceding requirements can be made without OMHSAS approval. All revisions to budget amounts made without OMHSAS approval must be included in the footnotes to the reports. The bank statements for the reinvestment account, as well as the bank reconciliation that reconciles the general ledger to the reinvestment account bank statements, must be submitted with each month's report. The Department reserves the right to request additional documentation.

The Primary Contractor and its subcontractor(s) shall be responsible for maintaining appropriate systems and mechanisms to obtain all necessary data from its health care providers to ensure its ability to comply with the Department's encounter data reporting requirements. Failure to maintain a 98% Professional and 95% Institutional encounter timeliness and/or acceptance rates may result in liquidated damages. Encounters will be evaluated using the Department's monthly timeliness and acceptance report. Timeliness: Timeliness is calculated as the number of days between the adjudication date and the date accepted into PROMISe. Acceptance: Acceptance is based on the number of approved and denied ICN's submitted for the month. Page 2 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix R Appendix R Encounter submissions adversely affected by the HIPAA translator or PROMISe system deficiencies will not be included by the Department in the calculation of compliance percentages. Primary Contractors, BH-MCOs and other HealthChoices Behavioral Health business partners will be notified by the Department of the specific types of encounters which will be excluded from penalty consideration under the timeliness and acceptance performance measures. B. Accuracy and Completeness Accuracy and completeness are primarily based on the consistency between encounter information submitted to the Department and information for the same service maintained by the BH-MCO in their claims/service history database. Accuracy and completeness will be determined through a series of analyses applied to BHMCO claims history data and encounters received and processed through PROMISe. These analyses will be conducted at least annually by the Department, or the Department's contractor. III. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISIONS Non-compliance with Department requirements, followed by a failure to submit and fully implement a Department approved corrective action plan, may result in the Department imposing liquidated damages on the Primary Contractor A. Timeliness and Acceptance B. Failure to comply with the encounter data timeliness and/or acceptance requirements may result in the imposition of liquidated damages of up to of 2% of monthly paid administrative revenue (or $2,000, whichever is greater), to a maximum of $25,000 per month. C. Accuracy and Completeness Errors in accuracy and/or completeness requirements that are identified by the Department, or the Department's contractor, in the data analysis may result in the imposition of liquidated damages. An error in accuracy, an error in completeness, or an error in both areas, within the same claim/encounter record, will count as one error toward the total count of records contained within the reviewed sample. The percentage of the sample that includes an error is calculated by dividing the total number of records within the sample that includes an error by the total number of records in the sample. Page 3 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix R Appendix R Percentage of the sample that includes an error Liquidated Damages Less than 1.00% None 1.00% - 4.99% Up to 1.00% of monthly paid Administrative revenue (or $2,000, whichever is greater), to a maximum of $10,000 per month. 5.00% - 7.49% Up to 2.00% of monthly paid administrative revenue (or $2,000, whichever is greater), to a maximum of $25,000 per month. 7.50% - 9.99% Up to 2.50% of monthly paid administrative revenue (or $2,000, whichever is greater), to a maximum of $50,000 per month. 10.00% or higher Up to 5.00% of monthly paid administrative revenue (or $2,000, whichever is greater), to a maximum of $75,000 per month. HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix S Appendix S(1) (Effective until 1/17/21) Medical Necessity Guidelines for Applied Behavioral Analysis Using Behavioral Specialist Consultant -Autism Spectrum Disorder and Therapeutic Staff Support Services for Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder Note: BSC- ASD and TSS can only be provided until 1/17/21. ABA is provide d through IBHS. Please see the medical necessity guidelines for IBHS included in Appendix S (2). DESCRIPTION OF APPLIED BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS Applied behavioral analysis (ABA) is the design, implementation and evaluation of environmental modifications, using behavioral stimuli and consequences, to produce socially significant improvement in human behavior or to prevent loss of attained skill or function, including the use of direct observation, measurement and functional analysis of the relations between environment and behavior. ABA is used to develop needed skills (behavioral, social, communicative, and adaptive functioning) through the use of reinforcement, prompting, task analysis, or other appropriate interventions in order for a child or adolescent to master each step necessary to achieve a targeted behavior. ABA can be used to treat autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ABA can be delivered through Behavioral Health Rehabilitation Services (BHRS) using Behavioral Specialist Consultant (BSC) -ASD (Doctoral Level), BSC- ASD (Master's Level), and Therapeutic Staff Support services. WHEN TO USE THESE GUIDELINES If the BH- MCO prior authorizes ABA using BSC -ASD services and TSS services for children and adolescents under age 21 with ASD, these medical necessity guidelines are to be used to review the request for ABA. I. ADMISSION The following documentation is required to support a request for BSC- ASD and TSS services to provide ABA for children and adolescents with ASD: 1. The most recent face- to-face strengths -based evaluation or re-evaluation completed by a Board Certified or Board eligible child and adolescent psychiatrist, developmental pediatrician, or licensed psychologist specializing in children or adolescents. In the absence of these practitioners, the evaluation or re-evaluation may be completed by any Board Certified or Board eligible psychiatrist or a licensed psychologist. The evaluation or re- evaluation must be signed by the evaluator/prescriber and performed not more than 60 days prior to the requested begin date of services. 2. A prescription for ABA. HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix S If the prescription for ABA does not differentiate between BSC -ASD and TSS services, include the specific hours per week of BSC- ASD and TSS services needed to deliver ABA, or identify the treatment setting (e.g., home, school, or identified places in the community) in which services will be provided, additional information should be requested. 3. An individualized, behavioral -based treatment plan that includes the interventions needed to address specific skills and targeted behaviors for improvement. The treatment plan must include measurable, achievable, and realistic goals for improving any identified behavioral challenges. The treatment plan must also include strategies for assessing and measuring the frequency of baseline deficits, adaptive behaviors, or skill development and use research -supported behavioral interventions. 4. One or more completed Interagency Service Planning Team (ISPT) Sign- In/Concurrence Form(s) including an explanation for any disagreement among team members with planned service intervention. 5. A Plan of Care Summary, which includes all Medical Assistance (MA) -funded services and non- MA funded services the child or adolescent is receiving or is expected to receive during the authorization period. When evaluating a request for prior authorization of BSC-ASD and TSS services to provide ABA for children and adolescents with ASD, the determination of whether the requested services are medically necessary must take into account whether the documentation indicates the following: A. 1. The child or adolescent has a diagnosis of ASD, per the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 2. The use of ABA is reasonably expected to reduce or ameliorate the presence of the child's or adolescent's maladaptive or restricted behaviors, impairments in communication, or impairments in social interaction or relationships. or The use of ABA is necessary to assist the child or adolescent with achieving or maintaining the skills needed for maximum functional capacity in performing activities of daily living. 3. The child's or adolescent's behaviors indicate that there is a manageable risk for safety to self and others while in the community and the child or adolescent does not require 24/7 medical oversight or a more restrictive level of care, such as inpatient treatment or a psychiatric residential treatment facility. 4. The amount of hours of services prescribed are reasonably expected to reduce or ameliorate the behavioral or developmental effects of ASD, enable the child or adolescent to achieve or maintain maximum functional capacity, or acquire the skills needed to perform developmentally appropriate activities of daily living. OR HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix S B. If the documentation does not support that the above has been met, but the individual reviewing the request for services determines that ABA is medically necessary to meet the behavioral needs of the child or adolescent, the requested services must be authorized. II. UCONTINUED CARE The following documentation is required to support a request for continued use of BSC- ASD and TSS services to provide ABA to children and adolescents with ASD: 1. The most recent face- to-face strengths -based re-evaluation completed by a Board Certified or Board eligible child and adolescent psychiatrist, developmental pediatrician, or licensed psychologist specializing in children or adolescents. In the absence of these practitioners, the re- evaluation may be completed by any Board Certified or Board eligible psychiatrist or a licensed psychologist. The re -evaluation must be signed by the evaluator/prescriber and performed not more than 60 days prior to the request to continue services. The re-evaluation should indicate if the number of hours of BSC-ASD and TSS services should be reduced, increased, or remain the same and the reason a change in the number of hours of services is needed or not needed. 2. A prescription for ABA. If the prescription for ABA does not differentiate between BSC- ASD and TSS services, include the specific hours per week of BSC- ASD and TSS services needed to deliver ABA, or identify the treatment setting (e.g., home, school, or identified places in the community) in which services will be provided, additional information should be requested. 3. An updated individualized, behavioral -based treatment plan that includes the interventions needed to address specific skills and targeted behaviors for improvement. The updated treatment plan must include measurable, achievable, and realistic goals for improving any identified behavioral challenges. The updated treatment plan must also include strategies for assessing and measuring the frequency of baseline deficits, adaptive behaviors, or skill development and use research - supported behavioral interventions. 4. One or more ISPT Sign-In/Concurrence Forms. a. If an ISPT meeting was required, the completed ISPT Sign- In/Concurrence Form(s) including an explanation for any disagreement among team members with planned service intervention. b. If only ISPT input was required, the ISPT Sign-In/Concurrence Form(s) reflecting input (including an explanation for any disagreement among team members) and the completed ISPT Sign-In/Concurrence Form from the initial ISPT meeting. 5. A Plan of Care Summary, which includes all MA-funded services and non- MA funded services the child or adolescent is receiving or is expected to receive during the authorization period. HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix S When evaluating a request for continued used of BSC- ASD and TSS services to provide ABA for children and adolescents with ASD, the determination of whether the requested services are medically necessary must take into account whether the documentation indicates the following: A. 1. The child or adolescent continues to meet the admission guidelines for BSC- ASD and TSS services. 2. The child or adolescent shows measured improvement and/or begins to demonstrate alternative/replacement behaviors. or The child or adolescent shows increased or continued skill deficits or challenging behaviors with expectation for improvement. or There is a reasonable expectation that the child or adolescent will continue to benefit from the continuation of ABA. OR B. If the documentation does not support that the above has been met, but the individual reviewing the request for continued services determines that ABA continues to be medically necessary to meet the behavioral needs of the child or adolescent, the requested services must be authorized. III. UDISCHARGE AND SERV ICE TRANSITION BSC- ASD and TSS services to provide ABA to children and adolescents with ASD should be discontinued for any of the following reasons: 1. Prescriber, with the participation of the interagency services planning team, determines that the expected response to ABA has been achieved and BSC- ASD and TSS services are no longer necessary. 2. BSC- ASD and TSS services are no longer effective to address targeted skills and behaviors. 3. The child's or adolescent's dependency on BSC -ASD and TSS services interferes with the child's or adolescent's progress toward his/her highest functional level and the benefit of continuing BSC- ASD and TSS services is outweighed by the potential problems continuation of services may cause. 4. The parent, guardian or other legally responsible caregiver, or adolescent, if the adolescent is 14 years old or older, requests that services be terminated.

The person is in need of Targeted Case Management Services as indicated by the evaluation of the functional level through utilization of the Targeted Case Management -Adult Environmental Matrix, and in conjunction with clinical information and the professional judgement of the reviewer. Continued Stay and/or Change of Level of Need The consumer must be reassessed at the point of concurrent review, but no less frequently than six month intervals, and when there are significant changes in the individual's situation that warrants a change in level of TCM services. I. The consumer continues to meet either I or II of part A Admission Criteria. and II. The person is in need of Targeted Case Management Services as indicated by the evaluation of the functional level through utilization of the Targeted Case Management -Adult Environmental Matrix and in conjunction with clinical information and the professional judgement of the reviewer. Discharge Indicators Targeted Case Management may be terminated when one of the following criteria is met: A. The consumer receiving the service determines that Targeted Case Management is no longer needed or wanted and the consumer no longer meets the continued stay criteria; or B. Determination by the targeted case manager in consultation with his/her supervisor or the director of targeted case management, and with written concurrence by the county administrator that targeted case management is no longer necessary or appropriate for the adult receiving the service and the consumer no longer meets the continued stay criteria; or Page 3 HC BH Program Standards & Requirements - January 1, 202 1 TCM Adult, Appendix T (Part A.2) C. The consumer receiving the service determines that Targeted Case Management is no longer wanted, however, the consumer does meet continued stay criteria; or D. The consumer has moved outside of the current geographical service area (e.g., county, state, country); or E. The consumer is undergoing long-term incarceration and/or long -term hospitalization or long-term skilled -nursing care without a discharge or anticipated discharge date. TCM ENVIRONMENTAL MATRIX \u2014 ADULTS INSTRUCTIONS The Environmental Matrix - Adults is a scale that evaluates the functional level of consumers on the six activities identified by regulation as Targeted Case Management activities. Cultural competency will be recognized throughout the entire evaluation process and the entire document. Individuals must be assessed in the following areas, in a face-to-face interview with the evaluator. Individuals should be reassessed as needed, but no less than every six months. 1. Assessment and Service Planning 2. Informal Support and Network Building 3. Use of Community Resources 4. Linking and Accessing Services 5. Monitoring of Service Delivery 6. Problem Resolution The scale has a range from 0 to 5 with the following values for each activity: 0 No assistance Needed All six activities are ranked on the above scale. The evaluator must complete the environmental matrix in a face- to - face, strengths - based assessment interview with the consumer. Evaluators should incorporate in their assessment a recognition/determination of cultural strengths (i.e., extended family, allocation of family resources, the decision making process, values, etc.). The evaluator should consider the individual's strengths and needs in the following life domains for each assessment area in order to produce a score that reflects the full dimension of need: 1 2 3 4 5 Minimal Needs Moderate Needs Significant assistance assistance in this assistance needed area in this area Page 4 HC BH Program Standards & Requirements - January 1, 202 1 TCM Adult, Appendix and other drug use. . Socialization/support . Activities of daily living . Medical treatment . Legal situation . Transportation issues . Criminal justice system involvement Each area is defined at the \"1\", \" 3 \", and \" 5 \" levels (See attached Environmental Matrix) and the subtotal score is divided by 6 to obtain the EM Score (when scoring the individual, refer to the Environmental Matrix TCM Service Scoring Grid which identifies the expected frequency of TCM contact needed for the individual for that particular assessment area). Scoring levels on individual assessment areas may be gradated to the 0.5 level only; this allows for minor differentiation of consumer need without compromising the integrity of the scale. Looking at the behavior, inclusive of the lowest level of functioning, of the consumer during the last ninety (90) days, rate the consumer's functional level in each of the six areas. Please note that the rating for each area should be made in whole numbers; in cases where there are extraordinary factors that make the assignment of whole numbers extremely difficult, if not impossible, 0.5 points may be added to or subtracted from the base scores. The sum of the six (6) scores should then be taken and divided by 6 and the resulting subtotal score should be reviewed and compared to other known factors that may affect the consumer's need for service. This should be noted on the scoring sheet. If after averaging the scores, the average is lower by at least 2 points than any one value given in any one assessment area (e.g., if a person's average is 2 and he/she received a score of 4 in any one area), the evaluator must provide written justification for assignment to the level that corresponds to the average, rather than the higher value. The Environmental Matrix score, your professional judgement *, and other information (e.g., cultural factors, records of past treatment, psychiatric evaluations, psychosocial summaries) that impacts on the consumer's level of need should then be considered and the Recommended Level of TCM service should be entered on the recommended level of TCM line of the Scoring Sheet. (These levels are consistent with minimum levels of contact as defined in Page 5 HC BH Program Standards & Requirements - January 1, 202 1 TCM Adult, Appendix T (Part A.2) Chapter 5221, Intensive Case Management regulations and Bulletin OMH -93-09, Resource Coordination: Implementation .) If the recommended level of TCM service differs from the Environmental Matrix score, the difference must be justified with professional judgement in \"Other Factors/Issues Affecting Score\" section of the scoring sheet. Note: The level of service indicated by the assessment represents the individual's needs at the time of assessment. Service intensity could change as an individual's needs and/or desires for service change. ENVIRONMENTAL MATRIX TCM SERVICE SCORING GRID MATRIX LEVEL NEED LEVEL INTENSITY OF CARE 4.0 -5.0 ICM At least 1 contact every 14 days (Face to face contact strongly recommended). 1.5 - 3.9 RC At least 1 face to face contact every two months 0.0 - 1.4 NO TCM NEEDED Alternative services may be needed and if necessary, referrals should be made. * professional judgement: opinion based on a thorough and ethical analysis of facts, data, history, and issues in accordance with one's training and experience. ASSESSMENT & SERVICE PLANNING The consumer is able to provide meaningful and accurate information regarding own mental health status and needs. The consumer, with possible assistance from the targeted case manager, identifies, formulates, and expresses personal goals and objectives and can correlate these into concrete service needs and activities.

This document provides a clear interpretive framework, in accordance with Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (OMHSAS) program, and Office of Medical Assistance Programs (OMAP) payment regulations, for deciding when to treat, continue or discontinue treatment, and refer elsewhere for other services. These criteria will serve the basis for decision -making for Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), county Mental Health/Mental Retardation/Intellectual Disabilities (MH/MR/ID) offices, and prescribers of children's mental health services in general, as well as for providers delivering their resp ective services to children qualifying for Medical Assistance (MA) coverage. This document provides a common set of criteria for reference by all the decision - makers in a child's care. These four (4) sets of criteria are intended to further consistency between the child's treatment needs and the broader philosophy of individualized service delivery in the most appropriate and least restrictive setting as guided, respectively, by the principles of the Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP) and the Community Service Program (CSP). Page 2 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.1) Background The Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (OMHSAS) produced Title 55 PA Code Chapters 5100, 5300, 4210, 5200, 5310, and 5210 to regulate the general delivery of services in community psychiatric inpatient, outpatient, residential, and partial hospitalization settings, while OMAP produced Title 55 PA Code, Chapters 1151 and 1153 to regulate M.A. payment for these services. Additional clarity for psychiatric residential treatment is provided in OMHSAS's proposed Chapter 5215 regulations. However, as more mental health services are developed for delivery in the home and community, in conjunction with a growing emphasis on providing services in the least restrictive environments necessary, greater clarity is required for mental health providers, case managers, interagency teams, and third party payers, including Managed Care Organizations and their sub -contractors, to make coordinated treatment determinations concerning appropriateness of admissions, continued stay, and discharge planning. It is for this reason that the criteria provided below have been developed. Presented in the opening section which precede the criteria, is a summary outline of the major aspects of service delivery, including: CASSP principles, the function of each of the four (4) treatment environments, and the importance of prescribing the least restrictive setting necessary. More detail is provided by the addenda in the document. Following the introduction are the individual \"Admission Criteria\" for each service. Each set of criteria is divided into three (3) sections, the first for determining \"Admission\", the second for determining the appropriateness of \"Continued Stay,\" and the third for identifying \"Discharge Criteria.\" For ease of reading in the following text, \"child(ren) and adolescent(s)\" shall be commonly referred to as \"child(ren),\" unless otherwise indicated. Introduction The mental health system has undergone substantial structural change from an emphasis on community segregation and maintenance of children with emotional disorders, to one of community integration and fostering increasing independence of individuals (see Mental Health/Mental Retardation Act of 1966 and the Mental Health Procedures Act of 1976 with subsequent amendments ). These changes are further reflected in the development of the Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP) and its philosophy. The OMHSAS summary representation of CASSP, is provided below: Page 3 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.1) The CASSP philosophy of collaborative service delivery to children, adolescents and their families undergirds all treatment methods. CASSP involves all child -serving systems including mental health, mental retardation, education, special education, children and youth services, drug and alcohol, juvenile justice, health care, and vocational rehabilitation. It should also include informal community support s and organizations. This philosophy is essential to making decisions to provide treatment for children. It is also the foundation for the development of these criteria. These principles are represented in the following six summary statements: (1) Child -centered - Services are planned to meet the individual needs of the child, rather than to fit the child into an existing service. Services should be develop - mentally appropriate and child -specific, and should also build on the strengths of the child and family to meet the mental health, social and physical needs of the child. (2) Family -focused - Services recognize that the family is the primary support system for the child. The family participates as a full partner in all stages of the decision -making and treatment planning process, including implementation, monitoring and evaluation. A family may include biological, adoptive and foster parents, siblings, grandparents and other relatives, and other adults who are committed to the child. The development of mental health policy at state and local levels should include family representation. (3) Community -based - Whenever possible, services should be delivered in the child's home community, drawing on formal and informal resources to promote the child's successful participation in the community. Community resources include not only mental health professionals and provider agencies, but also social, religious and cultural organizations and other natural community support networks. (4) Multi -system - Services should be planned in collaboration with all thechild - serving systems involved in the child's life. Representatives from all these systems and the family should collaborate to define the goals for the child, develop a service plan, develop the necessary resources to implement the plan, and provide appropriate support to the child and family. Page 4 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.1) (5) Culturally competent - Culture determines our world view and provides a general design for living and patterns for interpreting reality that are reflected in our behavior. Therefore, services that are culturally competent are provided by individuals who have the skills to recognize and respect the behavior, ideas, attitudes, values, beliefs, customs, language, rituals, ceremonies and practices characteristic of a particular group of people. Note: Pennsylvania's cultural competence initiative has focused specifically on African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans who have historically not received culturally appropriate services. (6) Least restrictive/least intrusive - Services should take place in settings that are the most appropriate and natural for the child and family and are the least restrictive and intrusive available to meet the needs of the child. These principles encompass not only the psychological, but the physical, cognitive, and socio -cultural development of children, which include the child's dependency on family, community, and environmental influences in general. From these principles, the four services for which \"Admission Criteria\" are provided below, can be understood as components within a wider network of service options. Severity of Symptoms The child's expression of impairment in any of the following should be considered in the design of the individual's treatment: judgement, thought, mood, affect, impulse control, psychosocial, psychomotor retardation/excitation, physiological functioning and/or cognitive/perceptual abilities. Challenging behaviors closely associated with social contexts such as family, school, or other community activities must also be considered when determining an appropriate treatment design, and the concomitant discharge planning. Intensity of Treatment The intensity and range of treatment varies for each of the four services. Psychiatric Inpatient and Residential Treatment are out of home services which provide highly intensive treatment for the purpose of returning children home, or to a homelike setting. Partial Hospitalization and Psychiatric Outpatient provi de services of varying intensity depending on the Page 5 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.1) child's need for therapeutic support to remain home. The therapeutic function and emphasis of each of the four services to return a child home, or to prevent out-of-home placements, depends strongly on the interaction between the therapist, the parents/guardians, and the child, for the effectiveness of the treatment plan developed. Psychiatric Inpatient hospitalization provides the most restrictive level of care. The setting is locked and highly focused toward the delivery of intensive, short term treatment. It serves as an appropriate placement for children expressing the sudden onset of acute symptoms, and/or requiring treatment which cannot be managed outside of a 24 hour, secure setting. Residential Treatment facilities provide a stable, open, community living setting for the delivery of comprehensive mental health treatment with 24 hour monitoring and a strong supportive environment from which the child is able to reenter the community. This is a longer term treatment option for children who require the comprehensive treatment and professional support of this setting to prevent a need for inpatient hospitalization. Partial hospitalization lies between the most restrictive and community -based levels of care. A partial hospitalization treatment program offers a wide range of treatmen t in a setting segregated from the child's natural setting for part of the day. Effective treatment and stabilization of the child must be possible within the partial hospital program hours prescribed in the treatment plan. Partial hospitalization provides an opportunity to observe a child's behavior and the effects of treatment, for the purpose of developing and confirming a proper course of treatment designed for the effective reintegration of the child into the community. Outpatient treatment is for children and their families who are seeking help and believe there is a need for mental health services. Services and treatment approaches include, diagnostic testing, crisis intervention services, behavior therapy, individual, group and family psychotherapy, medication, and similar services. The child should be able to maintain sufficient stability in his/her existing support network, to be treated effectively within the hours of outpatient treatment prescribed in the treatment plan. Treatment and services should be directed toward helping the child to remain integrated with his/her natural community and work to prevent the necessity of a more restrictive or intrusive service. Page 6 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.1) Least Restriction The four services addressed in this bulletin are presented in descending order of restrictiveness and in increasing order of community integration. The need for greater or lesser restrictiveness must be adjusted to the individual's need for active treatment as reflected in the treatment plan. Increased restrictiveness of setting improves the convenience and opportunity for immediate intervention in the delivery of treatment. However, less restrictive environments should be considered to prevent the removal of children from their families, peers, and normalized settings in the community. Each service provides treatment with the object of helping a child with acute behavioral problems or serious emotional disturbance to increase his or her functional capacity, in order to increase his/her ability to reintegrate into the community. Therefore, the goals of treatment may be summarized by the following: amelioration of symptoms such that less restrictive and/or less intrusive services can be planned and introduced; stabilization of medical regimen for children requiring psychotropic medication so they may remain in the least restrictive setting possible; prevention of regression/recidivism by improving the child's level of functioning and ability for self maintenance; coordination of the treatment and discharge plan on an ongoing basis with the family and the appropriate agencies to provide the necessary community based supports, including wraparound services; and increase in the age-appropriate interactiveness in a variety of settings [see Community Integration Attachment in Appendix C].

Page 24 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.1) FUNCTION OF THE FOUR SERVICES Inpatient Hospitalization : Inpatient hospitalization provides a locked setting for the delivery of acute care. Inpatient hospitalization combines security and restrictiveness with intensive treatment, for the purpose of ameliorating symptoms and reducing the need for such intensity of service by establishing within the child the self-control a n d /or capacity for constructive expression and more adaptive interpersonal skills necessary to continue treatment in a more natural and less restrictive setting. Inpatient hospitalization provides service for children with serious mental and/or serious emotional or behavioral problems who require the coordinated, intensive and comprehensive treatment available from a multi -disciplinary team within a secure setting. The inpatient hospitalization process and treatment must meet the conditions set forth in the MH/MR Act of 1966 and the MH Procedures Act of 1976. Treatment components include: major diagnostic assessments, medical and psychiatric treatment, and psychosocial rehabilitation (to include educational components, as appropriate to the child's development). Residential Treatment Facilities : Residential Treatment Facilities provide a safe environment within a restrictive setting for the delivery of psychiatric treatment and care. However, it is an unlocked, and otherwise, less restrictive, more flexible alternative than inpatient hospitalization for the delivery of acute care and for the provision of transitional care from an acute inpatient setting. Residential Treatment Facilities offer the comprehensive and intense services needed for the purpose of ameliorating symptoms, by establishing within the child the self-control, the capacity for constructive expression, and the adaptive interpersonal skills necessary to continue in a more natural and less restrictive setting. Residential Treatment Faciliti es provide service for children with serious mental and/or serious emotional or behavioral problems who require the coordinated, intensive and comprehensive treatment available from a multi -disciplinary team within a structured, residential setting. Page 25 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.1) Treatment components include: major diagnostic assessments, psychiatric and other medical treatment, and psychosocial rehabilitation. Psychosocial rehabilitation is an important vehicle through which psychiatric residential treatment facilities provide culturally competent service. These services provide the child with community linkages and the real world competency necessary for his/her successful return to the community. Residential Treatment Facilities must collaborate with the school district of residency, and, if different, the school district where the child in treatment is enrolled, to ensure the child receives educational instruction in the least restrictive setting appropriate to meet their needs while accommodating their behavioral and psychiatric difficulties (see Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, OMH -95-07; BEC 19-93; OCYF. Parents/gua rdians are actively involved in the treatment planning process and provided the opportunity to address the treatment of the child in the broader context of the family system. They may receive other additional supports necessary to develop the therapeutic environment the child needs to return home or to other community settings, including training and family therapy. Also, parents/guardians are to be informed of the appropriate parent support and advocacy groups available [see addendum], or any other involvement consistent with the applicable regulations. Partial Hospitalization Programs: Partial hospitalization provides a less restrictive, more flexible alternative than inpatient hospitalization for the delivery of acute care, by providing transitional and diversionary care from an acute inpatient setting. Partial hospitalization provides a short -term, intensive outpatient treatment as a transition to Outpatient Clinic services. Its purpose is to reduce the child's need for restrictive therapeutic settings for treatment, and help the child develop the necessary self-control and/or capacity for constructive expression, including more adaptive interpersonal skills, to make the transition to interacting more fu lly in family and community environments. Partial hospitalization provides service for children with serious mental and/or psychosocial disorders who require the coordinated, intensive and comprehensive treatment available from a multi -disciplinary team within a single setting (see \"Settings\" below). Page 26 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.1) Partial hospitalization provides day, after school , weekend, and evening service for children with mental and/or psychosocial disorders, so that : \u00b7 the child receives the additional support necessary to interact effectively and cooperatively with family members, thereby helping to insure the family bond; \u00b7 parents/guardians can receive family therapy/treatment consistent with the treatment of their child. Partial hospitalization uses group approaches to the treatment of children with serious mental and/or psychosocial disorders. Treatment components include: major diagnostic assessments, medical and psychiatric treatment, psychosocial rehabilitation (to include educational and prevocational components, as appropriate to the child's development), individual and group therapies and opportunities for family therapy. Recognizing the responsibility of the school districts to provide an educational program for all children, full day or school day partial hospitalization programs must collaborate with the school district of residency and the school district where the child in treatment is enrolled, to incorporate an educational program within the therapeutic milieu. Program Range - Partial hospitalization programs vary in the intensity and purpose of the services offered. The range of programs includes, on the one end, those serving a more acute population as a step-down from inpatient treatment, or as a preventive for a more restrictive treatment setting. On the other end are programs serving those with more long standing impairments, where clinical judgement suggests that partial hospitalization is therapeutically necessary to return the child or maintain the child in a stable condition while providing effective treatment. Settings - Child partial hospitalization programs serve a range of age groups from pre- school to late teens, and they also occur in a variety of settings. Typical settings may be characterized individually or in combination by place, such as, school settings, clinics, and free-standing units; by specified time of service, such as, morning, afternoon, all day, after-school, and evening, and some have 24 hour emergency phone service; and by established age categories, such as, pre-school, children, and adolescents. In those provided in public and private school settings serving the general population, the school system and the mental health system collaborate closely in meeting the educational and mental health needs of the child. Many facilities described as \"free -standing\" are designed specifically for those Page 27 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.1) children who require a secure setting for mental health treatment, and the coordination of education and treatment in the same setting. In other settings, such as a mental health agency, the educational component must be designed and developed to meet the child's needs in collaboration with the mental health agency. Outpatient Treatment: Provision of services which are less restrictive, more flexible yet effective supports for patients discharged from in-patient or partial hospitalization. In this way outpatient services provide for the delivery of transitional care from a more restrictive setting. Prevent the need for more intense services, or accompany more enhanced or community based services, to help the child develop the necessary self-control, and/or capac ity for constructive expression, including cultivating more adaptive interpersonal skills for effective participation in the child's natural setting. Provision of service for children with mental and/or psychosocial disorders who require the periodic support provided by this treatment, to remain stable and ensure the effectiveness of a treatment plan. Provision of after school service for children with mental and/or psychosocial disorders, so that : parents/guardians can receive the additional support necessary to maintain a therapeutic environment for the child; parents/guardians can receive family therapy consistent with the treatment of their child. Should service require removing the child during regular school hours, this service, and any subsequent plan to continue service during this time, must be documented with an explanation of the child's condition which necessitates such intervention. Treatment components include: major diagnostic assessments, medical and psychiatri c treatment. Recognizing the responsibility of the Department of Education to provide an educational program for all children, the therapist must collaborate with the school or school district, but only when appropriate and as necessary to assist in the child's Individualized Education Plan when one has been or should be developed. Where such collaboration is problematic, the reasons must be clearly documented. Page 28 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.1) Treatment Range - Outpatient treatment varies in both intensity and purpose. Intensity may be reflected in the number and length of visits as well as the duration and types of service offered. The range of service provides support for a more acute population and for those without long standing impairments, where clinical judgement suggests that outpatient treatment is therapeutically necessary to return the child to or maintain the child in a stable condition. Outpatient treatment may serve as a step-down from inpatient treatment and partial hospitalization, and to prevent the need for a more restrictive treatment setting. It also serves children, and their families, experiencing distress who may need the support of short term services to ameliorate the presiding condition or stress. Outpatient treatment is clearly identified by the setting from which it is offered. In concordance with Title 55 Public Welfare, Chapter 5200 Psychi atric Outpatient Clinics , the domain of this level of treatment for the scope of this document is the clinic, exclusive of partial hospitalization and other day-treatment programs. Continued Stay Service Documentation The following list of information should be documented for all four services. 1. Routine assessments and treatment updates chart child's progress. 2. The establishment and documentation of active treatment must include, the implementation of the treatment plan, the therapy provided, documentation of the family's participation and interagency collaboration, cultural competency, and active discharge planning. 3. Current active treatment is focused upon stabilizing or reversing symptoms necessitating admission. 4. Current active tr eatment is focused on ameliorating symptoms and increasing the child's level of functioning. 5. The level of professional expertise and intervention are appropriate to address the child's current condition(s). 6. The initial discharge criteria formulated for the child have been reviewed and revised, as necessary in the course of developing the discharge plan. Page 29 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.1) 7. The treatment plan and strengths -based evaluation has been updated to reflect the child's progress, medication status, continuing needs and the provider's efforts to meet the identified needs. The treatment plan addresses any necessary supports for the child's successful transition into the community, including mental health and other community -based services, and the natural resources of the family. It incorporates a plan to form appropriate transitional linkages in preparation for discharge to a less restrictive setting. 8. The treatment team programmatically reduces intensity of treatment as the child progresses toward the expected date of discharge, and forms linkages with community and family supports. 9. Type, duration and frequency of services provided to the child, and the outcome of each service must be well documented, i.e.- individual, group and family therapy; education, training and community involvement; family participation in treatment; any special activities; and medication administration and monitoring. 10. As the child improves clinically, active treatment facilitates and increases contact of the child with the community (including home and school) to which the child will return. 11. The provision of services supports the child's involvement in age appropriate activities and interests. 12. In special programs where the child does not attend the local school, there must be a current Individualized Education Plan and/or plan to provide the child an educational program in collaboration with the local school or school district on record at the PRTF. 13. Family (parent, guardian or custodian) is actively involved in the treatment planning and/or process. Should conditions prevent the possibility of such involvement, attempts to involve parents and/or reasons explaining their non -involvement must be fully documented and presented to an interagency team. 14. Continued inpatient hospitalization must be recommended by the treatment team (to also include child, parent/guardian, case manager [when one is assigned], current treating or evaluating therapist). Page 30 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.1) 15. All appropriate documentation follows the child as the child makes the transition to other therapeutic services, be they more or less intense. Page 31 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.1) Community Integration Questionnaire 1. Are the child's interest areas ? and strengths ? documented, with a plan to explore new interests and strength's for the child? 2. Have the child's community and family support network, and cultural resources been explored for the purpose of involving the child in his/her own community, and recorded? 3. Has there been recruitment of family members, or other significant individuals, to participate as designated support persons 4. Do you have a list of the available services, events and activities in the community? [Both the child's home community and the community surrounding the therapeutic center, if different]. 5. What activities has the child been involved in over the past two months? Is there a plan to continue this involvement? 6. Does the treatment plan include community integrative activities, such as: - planned parental supervised activities? - age appropriate, child independent participation in planned community activities [such as: Traditional events; school sponsored clubs and gatherings; extra -curricular classes (ie. dance, music, martial arts, etc); church or community center picnic, etc.]? - opportunity for child -peer interaction in the community [such as: visits to neighborhood friends (including overnight visits); participation in peer group activities [such as: neighborhood \"hoops\", stick ball, parties and informal gatherings]. - [other activities - specify in treatment plan]. OR, for children who may be more severely impaired: - staff oversite of planned parental supervised activities? - staff supervised activities for parent/child interaction? for child/community peer interaction? - staff supervised activities in the community? - planned reentry into the regular classroom (independently, or with a therapeutic staff support)? Page 32 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.1) 7. Do you have a plan of reenforcement for a child's successful participation outside of the treatment setting? and a crisis intervention plan for the child while outside of the treatment setting? 8. Do the progress notes detail the outcome of the home/community integrative activity? 9. Do you have a data gathering form or instrument to measure the outcome of a child's participation in a home/community activity? 10. Do you have a plan to expand the child's home/community/cultural participation?

No BHRS may be provided after 1/17/21. HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) INTRODUCTION: Generally absent in both regulation and the literature on behavioral health, are admission guidelines for behavioral health services delivered to children in their homes, schools, and daily community activities. The availability of these services is required under the federal ruling titled the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Public Law 101-239) as specifically described in the section called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT). Implementation of OBRA '89 in Pennsylvania was established through the Medical Assistance Bulletin 1241 -90-02 of October 15, 1990. While there has been a strong focus on development and expansion of needed services to respond to children with behavioral health treatment needs in multiple child serving systems, more work is required to regulate use of services. Clearly, with concerns about containing cost while enhancing the efficacy of treatment affecting decisions on service delivery, guidelines are needed to bridge the purpose, function, and expectations of these services with actual service delivery. Up to now, the primary connection has been the determination of medical necessity, in combination with the application of the Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP) principles, and a variously applied understanding of the \"Wraparound\" philosophy of care. The guidelines and classification system presented in this document and subsequent revisions, provide a basis for admitting children and adolescents to behavioral health services delivered in the home, and school, or elsewhere in the community, under EPSDT, and within the context of multiple child serving systems. For ease of reading in the text which follows \"child\" will refer to both child and adolescent unless otherwise stated. CASSP principles and the Wraparound philosophy of care provide the foundation supporting the effort to provide mental and behavioral health services to children in their homes and communities. It is understood here that home/community delivered services are not simply intended to be a replacement for all other clinic and hospital based services. These relatively new services are to address the increasingly complex needs of children receiving services in multiple child serving systems (i.e.- child welfare, juvenile justice, education, intellectual disabilities, and drug & alcohol) and offer an alternative to some of the functions clinic/hospital based services have previously played, because home/community delivered services are considered more appropriate to specific tasks of directed treatment. Home/community delivered behavioral health services are specifically appropriate for children and adolescents who require intervention at the sites where their problematic behaviors occur. This eliminates the necessity to understand and treat problems, behaviors, or activities in an abstract form dissociated from their actual occurrence, and allows direct intervention. In this way the clinician observes and learns directly from the child's behavior in the natural context, but it also allows the child and clinician to formulate together the language and symbolic references to the problem and the strategies for resolution. Thus the interaction between the child and clinician is not dependent on first understanding an abstract expression of the problem, and allows the child to firmly establish the practical ity of the therapeutic intervention. The clinician is not solely dependent on informants and the child receiving treatment for information, nor does the child need HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) to transfer change which occurs in the clinic or institutional setting to the family or community setting where the problem primarily manifests. The purpose for any recommended service must be justified and clearly stated whether they are clinic or home based. Also, the recommendation for services must carefully consider not only treatment for an identified problem, but the child's multi -system involvement, willingness to engage in treatment, the confidentiality concerns of both the child and family, and whether safety issues require a certain level of restrictiveness in the treatm ent planning for a particular child or adolescent. Making the decision for the type and level of service is not always easy, but the rationale for the decision made is necessary. Building the rationale requires the appropriate diagnostic and life domain assessments, treatment and interagency team involvement, and the spirit of building a cooperative effort to enhance the intervention in order to achieve the goals of treatment. Home/Community Services The behavioral health system has undergone substantial structural change from an emphasis on community segregation and maintenance of children with emotional disorders, to one of community integration and skill development essential in fostering increasing independence of individuals and families (see Mental Health/Mental Retardation Act of 1966 and the Mental Health Procedures Act of 1976 with subsequent amendments). The change in emphasis from providing service to children exclusively in established sites, such as clinics and hospitals, and residential and day treatment centers, to serving children individually where they live, learn and play in the community is reflective of this overall change. These changes are supportive of the wraparound philosophy of care to the extent that these community delivered services are often identified as \"wraparound services.\" Wraparound is a philosophy which promotes developmentally appropriate behavior, activities, skills, and social skills for the child in his/her natur al context through focusing on his/her individualized strengths and needs. More broadly, it promotes the opportunity for family independence from professional treatment and therapeutic supports. Family autonomy in the care of children with special needs may be fostered through skill development and assisting the family in the development of their informal support network. An understanding of the social contexts of the child or adolescent, including school and community as well as home, is essential to determining the appropriate sites for interventions and the resources available. When professional services provide a necessary treatment, the service(s) must be focused on accomplishing a set of goals, and incorporate into the planning the appropriate tapering of the service or the replacement of the service with informal and other non- behavioral health therapeutic supports. The Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (OMHSAS) has promoted the development of expanded behavioral health services in response to the need for services delivered to children in natural community settings. In Pennsylvania these services have multiple references including, \"EPSDT mental health services\", \"expanded mental health services,\" \"psychosocial HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) rehabilitative services\" and \"'wraparound' mental health services\". However, EPSDT refers to more than the services considered in the Level of Care protocols to follow, \"enhanced\" is a term relative to the services currently offered and therefore not necessarily restricted to community based services, and \"wraparound\" is a philosophy of care and implementation within which professional services may play a role. For clarity in this paper, the services are called simply by their association with home and community. Other psychosocial rehabilitative services which are offered on provider -site, such as therapeutic summer programs and after-school programs are not incorporated into the protocol for home/community services. It is in the application that home/community services must be medically necessary, adhere to the requirement of EPSDT service provision, and should be consistent with the wraparound process. Treatment objectives may be characterized in at least three ways, individualized, generalized, and service specific. Individualized objectives for the child and family must be created as part of a treatment process which is strengths -based and developmentally appropriate. The generalized objectives reflected in the admission guidelines for clinic and hospital based services are as follows: ameliorate symptoms such that less restrictive and/or less intrusive services can be planned and introduced; stabilization of medical regimen for child ren requiring psychotropic medication which helps them to effectively receive the least restrictive/least intrusive services possible; promotion of psychosocial growth and development and prevention of regression/recidivism by improving the child's level of functioning and ability for self maintenance; coordination of the treatment and discharge plan on an ongoing basis with the appropriate agencies to provide the necessary natural community based supports; and increase in age-appropriate interactivity in a variety of settings [see \"Community Integration Questionnaire\" in Reference Form D (p. 27)]. Some objectives more specific to the home/community services have been mentioned above, such as: development and practice of interpersonal skills as necessary to enhance parent/child, child/adult, and child/peer relations; identification of personal, family and community resources and exploring their usage; and directly relating therapeutic aims with social contexts and laying the groundwork for treatment which references the problem (a higher level of abstraction) such as occurs in clinic based treatment. Home and community services are developed and tailored specifically to meet individualized child and family needs (see Table 2). Specialized therapeutic services on the Medical Assistance fee schedule are: Mobile Therapy, Behavioral Specialist Consultant (Doctoral Level), Behavioral Specialist Consultant (Master's Level), Therapeutic Staff Support (TSS), and Summer Therapeutic Activities Program. Each of the first four services is distinct and described in Medical Assistance Bulletin 01-94-01, issued January 11, 1994 on \"Outpatient Psychiatric Services for Children Under 21 Years of Age.\" The last is a new pro gram which is described in Medical Assistance Bulletin 50-96-03, issued April 25, 1996. All of these services are provided for the purpose of improving and developing the capacity of the treated child or adolescent, and the family, thereby contributing toward the independence of the family as a unit. The need for these services will vary according to the severity of the child's problems and the richness of the resources of the child, the family, and the community. HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) In this edition of the guidelines for behavioral health home/community services, guidelines for the delivery of home and community behavioral health services to children with intellectual disabilities have been added. The Office of Developmental Programs supports the provision of services in homes and communities. These behavioral health services provide discrete short term, goal oriented rehabilitative interventions to children with intellectual disabilities. The availability of these services helps to ensure that children with intellectual disabilities receiving services have access to additional therapeutic interventions when medically necessary and to assist them remain in their communities. The structural changes in the behavioral health system are reflected in the development of the Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP) and its philosophy. Within the body of this Bulletin is emphasized the importance of consistency in the services with the CASSP principles. The OMHSAS summary representation of the CASSP principles, is provided below. CASSP Principles The CASSP philosophy of collaborative service delivery to children, adolescents and their families undergirds all treatment methods. CASSP involves all child -serving systems including mental health, intellectual disabilities, education, special education, children and youth services, drug and alcohol, juvenile justice, health care, and vocational rehabilitation. It should also include informal community supports and organizations. This philosophy is essential to making decisions to provide treatment for children. It is also the foundation that motivates the development of these guidelines. These principles are represented in the following six summary statements: (1) Child -centered - Services are planned to meet the individual needs of the child, rather than to fit the child into an existing service. Services should be developmentally appropriate and child -specific, and should also build on the strengths of the child and family to meet the mental health, social and physical needs of the child. (2) Family -focused - Services recognize that the family is the primary support system for the child. The family participates as a full partner in all stages of the decision -making and treatment planning process, including implementation, monitoring and evaluation. A family may include biological, adoptive and foster parents, siblings, grandparents and other relatives, and other adults who are committed to the child. The development of mental health policy at state and local levels should include family representation. (3) Community -based - Whenever possible, services should be delivered in the child's home community, drawing on formal and informal resources to promote the child's successful participation in the community. Community resources include not only mental health professionals and provider agencies, but also social, religious and cultural organizations and other natural community support networks. HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) (4) Multi -system - Services should be planned in collaboration with all the child - serving systems involved in the child's life. Representatives from all these systems and the family should collaborate to define the goals for the child, develop a service plan, develop the necessary resources to implement the plan, and provide appropriate support to the child and family. (5) Culturally competent - Culture determines our world view and provides a general design for living and patterns for interpreting reality that are reflected in our behavior. Therefore, services that are culturally competent are provided by individuals who have the skills to recognize and respect the behavior, ideas, attitudes, values, beliefs, customs, language, rituals, ceremonies and practices characteristic of a particular group of people. Note: Pennsylvania's cultural competence initiative has focused specifically on African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans who have historically not received culturally appropriate services. (6) Least restrictive/least intrusive - Services should take place in settings that are the most appropriate and natural for the child and family and are the least restrictive and intrusive available to meet the needs of the child. These principles encompass not only the psychological, but the physical, cognitive, and socio -cultural development of children, which include the child's dependency on family, community, and environmental influences in general. From these principles, the home/ community delivered services for which \"Admission Guidelines\" are provided below, can be understood as components within a wider network of service options. CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM : Because the collective of home/community behavioral health services is appropriate to treat the full range of symptom severity, an organizational system for associating intensity of service with severity of need is essential. This is different from the current clinic and hospital based services which associate the individual service with the severity of need, such that inpatient hospitalization is associated with higher severity of symptoms than that of partial or outpatient. By dividi ng the community delivered services into four levels of intensity from least to most, these services roughly parallel the four traditional categories of clinic and hospital based services: Outpatient; Partial Hospitalization; Residential Treatment; and Inpatient Hospitalization. Services are further divided into two types: treatment and therapeutic support. With intensity of service defined by the amount of time the service is provided, as related to the type of service provided, the four levels of home/community delivered services may be identified as contiguous segments along a continuum of intensity. The first of the four levels describes the criteria for the children with the least severe need HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) who are eligible for the service. Each of the successive levels represents an increase in the severity level for which it is designed. Criteria for children with intellectual disabilities are identified in the first two levels only with the recognition that if these children display greater severity in their symptomatology they may receive an axis I diagnosis. Because all of the home/community delivered services are available for each of the levels, the variation in intensity must be ranked by how much service is delivered. Time is selected as a general measure of quantity for each of the levels, because it is already used in this way to determine payment when a rate is assigned to the service. At this writing, the range of hours for each of the levels is not identified, however the levels represent a proportional relationship between both, the identified levels of severity and the range of services within each. There are a maximum of four components to each of the levels. In order of presentation in the guidelines and the table: the first part identifies the type and extent of the emotional and behavioral disturbance, including the degree of endangerment; the second requires assurance that the child or adolescent and the family is amenable to treatment in community settings; while the third assures that there is the professional opinion that the service necessary is at this level of intensity. The fourth level applies only to the two least intensive levels and tends to serve the purpose of observation based on an initial assessment of need which needs greater clarity. As the two highest levels involve a higher severity of symptoms, \"observation\" for the purpose of determining the problem does not apply. Differentiation between the levels rests primarily with the severity of the problem, and the ability to treat in the community but it also includes the risk of endangerment allowed. More care is required of the assessment of endangerment, but the other categories solicit the psychiatrist or psychologist to elaborate their justification. The usual process for determining improvement or relapse and identifying service and therapeutic support needs, should guide the use of the services. Using a continuum of severity expresses schematically the importance of allowing children to flow from one category to another as indicated by the child's needs (see Table 2, below). However, suggesting discrete categories with fixed ranges may be interpreted in a manner contradictory to the value of a continuum in providing fluidity. The association of fixed ranges of time with each level is complicated by the potential mix in the available array of services such as clinic based services, services from other child serving systems, or the inclusion of informal family and community supports. These issues beg the question of whether the severity levels may be so firmly attached to the hours of service that a child associated with one level must \"officially\" be reduced to another level, in order to reduce the hours of home/community based services; though the \"true\" severity level is higher, and the child, in truth continues to receive a high number of hours of service, but from other sources. Ideally, each severity level would have a range of hours for serving a child in each of three categories: clinic/hospital services; home/community services; and the service inherent in the personal support network. However, the usual application of admission guidelines is to structure the use of a specific service or service category, and that is the exercise here. The establishment of a recommended range of hours for the delivery of home/community services is not addressed, except to suggest an adjustable range of times depending on the other services used or functions served by family members, and that there is a HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) proportional increase in the expectation of the maximum amount of service within each category. For the purpose of establishing a reasonable framework, it will be assumed that the hours assigned do not consider the complicating factors of other services and other therapeutic supports, or temporary reductions of service to assess progress. The next task will be to set up a system of values for any additional services and therapeutic supports which can be used as weights to identify a child with the appropriate level. Page 8 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) GUIDELINE FORMATION : Working toward furthering consistency between children's treatment needs and the broader philosophy of individualized service delivery in the most appropriate manner, is a complex task. Generalizing work such as, the principles of the Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP), the values presented in a variety of CASSP publications, and the wraparound philosophy of care, provide a theoretical basis, and though this body of work has much room to grow, it is time to develop the tools of implementation. The work of admission guidelines for home/community based services is an important beginning to provide a unified basis for decision - making. It is one of the essential instruments needed for behavioral health providers, case managers, interagency teams, and third party payers (including Managed Care Organizations and their sub -contractors), to coordinate service determinations among themselves and with families (including friends and community services as appropriate). Such coordination is vital to foster confidence in the appropriateness of admissions to any of the recommended treatment modalities, as well as continued stay, and appropriate discharge planning. Inherent in these guidelines is a framework for implementing the wraparound concept in service delivery and developing discrete individualized service programs. Individualized treatment plans may coordinate a number of services but importantly, the functions of the services must be identified so that they build upon actual strengths, actual needs are addressed by the services. It is also important to help develop family and community resources to meet these needs. Traditional outpatient and partial hospitalization services are examples of other services which may be coordinated with home/community delivered services when medically necessary. Home/community treatment is for children who: may be effectively treated at home; who require comprehensive wraparound planning for transition from a more restrictive setting back to the home and community; who may require a treatment support system while in the community until an effective family and community support network can be activated. These services provide a full range of intensity to the child in his/her natural setting, depending on the evaluated need of the child. In considering the intensity of home/community service, delivery involves three basic elements of consideration: severity of presenting problem, appropriate intensity of service, and the least restrictive and/or intrusive service necessary. These elements are considered separately below. Page 9 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) Severity of Symptoms Symptom severity is often more apparent to the clinician than it is easy to describe. Levels with identifiable indicators can make the process of assessing severity easier. Additional descriptive information remains important to provide clarifying documentation in the child or adolescent's record. Each of the four levels represented in these guidelines requires an assessment of the child's expression of emotional and behavioral disturbance in any of the following categories for consideration in the design of the individual's treatment: judgement, thought, mood, affect, impulse excit ation, physiological functioning and/or cognitive/perceptual abilities. Also important is an assessment of the impact of any disturbance on social skill development and the relationship between them. Gaging the severity of any of these presenting symptoms is ultimately left to the judgement of the clinician in his or her review. If severity is otherwise linked to endangerment or imminent risk of out-of-home or out- of-school placement, descriptors may be crafted to indicate relative severity. Challenging behaviors closely associated with social contexts such as family, school, or other community activities must be considered when determining an appropriate treatment design involving home/community services, or any combination of home/community and the more conventional services. The severity of presentation determines the extent of service need. The severity of expression for a child with intellectual disabilities must be evaluated in relation to the individual child's behavioral norm or \"baseline.\" The design of the treatment plan must also consider the concomitant discharge planning. Intensity of Treatment The intensity and range of treatment varies for each of the home/community services available for children (see Table 1). But because different treatment plans call for different combinations of services to treat a variety of children or adolescents who could be assessed at the same level of severity, intensity is associated with a multiplicity of service options and gauged by the amount of total service time needed. However, one division has been made, establishing two tiers of service based on the professional level of the service. The first is \"home/community professional behavioral health services,\" such as Mobile Therapy and Behavioral Specialist Consultant, and the second is \"home/community behavioral health implementation -therapeutic support services,\" such as Therapeutic Staff Support (TSS) and Therapeutic Staff Support Aid (TSSA). The professional services are those performed by highly credentialed individuals who also play a critical role in the development of the treatment plan. Therapeutic support services require personnel who have specific training and a Bachelor's degree or, for TSSAs, a High School diploma. Their role is to assist the child or adolescent, and the family, in the follow - through of the treatment plan. Page 10 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) Of the four severity levels, the last two listed are intended to divert the child or adolescent from out-of-home services, or serve as a step down following the child's discharge from any in- patient or out-of-home placement. Highly intensive community delivered treatment is often needed to prevent out-of-home placement, and/or to help children to return to their natural home, school, and community from an out-of-home placement. This works by directly associating the therapeutic process of treatment with effective adaptation to the social environment. The first two severity levels allow a lower range of service intensity to assist the child and family. All the levels provide treatment, but they also encourage the family's developmental process in unassisted interaction. The therapeutic function and emphasis of each of the four service levels depends strongly on the cohesiveness of the interagency and treatment teams and the interaction between the behavioral health staff, the parents/custodians, and the child, for the effectiveness of the treatment plan developed. Least Restrictive/Least Intrusive Structural differences between the two kinds of services allow each to be scaled differently along the CASSP principle of providing the least restrictive and least intrusive services necessary. The site -based services, clinics and hospitals, may be scaled on a continuum of restrictiveness from more to less. Restrictiveness essentially refers to the degree the child or person is separated from the general community and integrated into a treatment community. For off-site delivery of services, or those delivered to individuals in their homes, schools, or other community settings, scaling restrictiveness does not apply. However, these services may be scaled on a continuum of intrusiveness, if intrusiveness is to be understood as the degree to which service is integrated into the natural setting and the lifestyle of the individual(s) served. It is through this understanding that it may be asserted that mental and behavioral health services in the lives of clients are not \"natural,\" but an intervention intended to be time-limited. Of course, depending on the severity of the problem, the network of inclusion/ support and the other environmental/ecological factors, the time required for individuals' successful treatment will vary. It is these last three elements which are used to formulate the classification system in the guideline. Home/community services are generally regarded as the least restrictive service options for children who need intensive behavioral health services. However, by delivering services to children in their homes and communities these services may potentially be the most intrusive. Traditionally, intensive behavioral health services were designed to provide treatment in settings separate from the community, such as inpatient and partial hospitalization settings, residential treatment facilities, and outpatient clinics. This segregation of children from greater community involvement for the period of treatment has become the defining characteristic of restrictiveness and allows considerat ion of these services on a continuum from least restrictive to more restrictive. Home/community services parallel the intensity available in the traditional services, but because these services engage the child in family and community activities home/community Page 11 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) services are not easily characterized as restrictive. However, they may be identified with intrusiveness due to their close involvement with, and presence in the daily activities of the child receiving treatment, and the family. The four levels for the delivery of the home and community addressed in this bulletin, are presented in ascending order of service intensity and professional intervention. The need for greater or lesser intensity of service must be adjusted to the individual's need for active treatment as reflected in the evaluation and the treatment plan. Increased intensity of service may improve the effectiveness of treatment by providing convenience and opportunity for more responsive intervention. Reducing levels of intervention is a necessary element of therapy directed toward fostering and developing independence in the relationship formations of children with their families, peers, and functioning in normalized settings in the community. Also, care must be taken to avoid the development of a dependency relationship between any family members and behav ioral health professionals which result in a non-therapeutic alliance. Each service level provides treatment with the object of helping children with acute behavioral problems or serious emotional disturbance to increase their ability to integrate into the community and culture of their respective families by increasing his or her capacity for self control. ADMISSION GUIDELINES : Criteria for each level of Home/community service is based on the individual severity indicators. In the admission guidelines described below is a process for deciding when to treat, continue, or discontinue treatment and refer elsewhere for other services. However, the concept of tapering, or systematically reducing the intensity of the services delivered has been added here. The guideline is divided into five (5) sections: I- Diagnostic Evaluation and Documentation; II- Severity Levels and Service Correlates; III- Therapeutic Support Criteria; IV- Continued Care; and V- Discharge and Service Transition. The first three include the evaluation and documentation criteria for Admission, the fourth and fifth are for determining the appropriateness of continuing, tapering, and discontinuing care. As these guidelines are written, it is assum ed that any child or adolescent receiving services has a case manager, that children with intellectual disabilities have a county MH/MR/ID case manager, and that all children with multiple systems involvement have incorporated into the planning process an interagency team. Concerning the structure of Section II which associates the severity of the presenting problem with four contiguous levels, each level proposes corresponding ranges of hours for both professional behavioral health services and behavioral health therapeutic support services. For the purpose of clarity in the structure, the hours proposed assume there are no other services provided to the individual in treatment. Nor do they carry any presumption of the richness of the home/community therapeutic supports available to the child or adolescent in treatment. However, both the system and community therapeutic supports are critical to the appropriate determination of service hours to be delivered. It is for Page 12 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) this reason that Table 2 has been included. This table provides two matrices, one for reviewing the problems of the child and the other for the strengths of the child, family and community. Each lists the possible domains and settings affected. The matrices are designed to help in the decision -making process when determining the appropriate mix of services, and the appropriate adjustment for the amount of the services in each severity level in Section II below. Such determinations should be used and documented as an adjustment of time within the severity level selected, and it is expected that this is a natural part of any interagency or treatment team process. Home/Community Services Admission Guidelines (Must meet I, II, and III) Admission of a child for Home/Community Behavioral Health Treatment is most appropriately based on a face-to-face assessment and diagnosis by the prescribing Board Certified or Board eligible child and adolescent psychiatrist, developmental pediatrician, or licensed psychologist specializing in children or adolescents. In the absence of these prescribers, a diagnosis may be appropriately provided by any Board Certified or Board eligible psychiatrist or a licensed psychologist. Any time a child or adolescent specialist is unavailable to perform the necessary diagnostic services, this sho uld be documented and explained. As part of the assessment process and the development of treatment recommendations, the prescriber addresses the concerns and recommendations of the case manager and the interagency team. Diagnostic references for the purpose of the documentation below must be from the most current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The most current edition in use at this writing is the DSM IV; for ease of reading, the text following will reflect this edition. For further convenience in reading, \"child and adolescent\" will follow the form of \"child\", unless otherwise indicated.

Behavior is assessed to be manageable in the home/community setting, and degree of risk is assessed to be responsive to, and effectively reduced by the implementation of a behavior management plan in the professional judgment of the advising physician or mental health professional, as a result of: 1. the delivery of the professional care required to serve the child's specific treatment needs occurs on site; and 2. there is documented commitment by the primary care givers (usually parent/guardian) to the therapeutic plan. and 3. if endangerment/destruction is a relevant feature of the presenting problem, both adolescent and prima - ry care giver develop a safety plan which, at least the care giver signs. 3. if endangerment/destruction is a relevant feature of the presenting problem, both child or adolescent and primary care giver develop a safety plan which, at least the care giver signs. AND C. The severity and expression of the child's symptoms are such that:: 1. continuation with a less intense level of care cannot offer either an expectation of improvement, or prevention of deterioration, as identified above; and 2. on-site intervention in the home or community offers a more effective preventive to longer term consequences. D. OBSERVATION - 15 days 1. Troubling symptoms of the child (described by family/ school/ others) persist though - not observed on a psychiatric inpatient unit, or - they are denied by the child in outpatient or partial hos- pitalization treatment, Page 31 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) TABLE 1 Level 1 (Least) Level 2 (Moderate) Level 3 (Intensive) Level 4 (Highly Intensive) such tha t observation of the child in natural settings provides the opportunity to assess and treat the child; OR 2.

SUPPORT CRITERIA The on-site clinical expertise necessary must be available as appropriate to the SEVERITY OF BEHAVIORS. There must be family commitment to the treatment process of the child or adolescent. The treatment must support community integration objectives including development of the child/adolescent's network of personal, family, and community support. IV. CONTINUED CARE Whenever service is provided for a term greater than three (3) months, there must be at least a quarterly review of the child being served which clarifies the child's progress, progress toward developing community linkages, and the necessity for continuing home/community service. 1. Child must be reevaluated and continue to meet criteria for admission (I); and 2. Child shows: a) measured improvement and/or begins to demonstrate alternative/replacement behaviors (show indicators in the evaluation); or b) increased or continued behavioral or emotional disturbance with continued expectation for improvement (show rationale in the treatment plan); and 3.

Treatment plan must be updated addressing the presenting problem within the context of the psychosocial stressor(s)/event(s); indicating that service should be: a) continued with a reduced number of hours as a result of the amelioration of original indication for service, and/or activity of community members and services, and/or the child's network of family and friends; or b) increased due to changes in the context and/or adjustments in the treatment plan; and 5.Interagency service plan must be updated to reflect the recommendation to continue care and be attached to the treatment plan TABLE 1 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) V. DISCHARGE CRITERIA A. Prescriber, with the participation of the interagency team, determines that home/community service: 1. results in an expected level of stability and treatment goal attainment for the intervention such that the child meets: a. baseline behavior, or b. expected positive behavioral response, and/or c. that no additional home/community services are necessary; OR 2.should be discontinued because it ceases to be effective , requiring reassessment of services and alternative planning prior to authorization of any further home/community behavioral health services; OR 3.the services provided create a service dependency interfering with the development of the child's progress toward his/her highest functional level , requiring reassessment of the treatment plan and careful analysis of the benefits derived in light of the potential for problems created; OR B. The parent/guardian (or other legally responsible care giver if applicable) or adolescent, 14 years old or older, requests reduction in service or termination of the service.

The child's emotional or behavioral disturbance should be carefully evaluated along the following parameters: thought, mood, affect, judgement, insight, impulse control, psychomotor retardation /excitation, physiological functioning, cognitive/perceptual abilities, psychosocial functioning as manifested in interpersonal and social skills, and motivation. Social contexts, such as home, school, and neighborhood/community must be understood in order to determine the appropriate sites of services as well as the resources within each context. Service planning determines the unique combination of individualized community based enhanced mental health services, other child serving systems and/or traditional mental health services. The following represent specific expectations regarding the utilization of all individualized, community based enhanced mental health services subject to this document. Treatment and its documentation should be consistent with the following: - Nature of emotional or behavioral disturbance, mental illness, or serious at-risk status is clear and is clearly demonstrated. - Each proposed or utilized mental health service has a clearly documented rationale, with a specific role in addressing the child's medically necessary needs. Services, separably and in combination, constitute the least restrictive and least intrusive services which are medically necessary. - Service decisions are substantially determined by an interagency process based on child - driven needs. - Proposed treatment is demonstrated to meet identified, individualized needs and strengths, addressing child's development in multiple life domains. - Ongoing efforts are being made to utilize community resources, whenever possible. - Parents and guardians have requested or otherwise support the use of proposed services. - Proposed treatment involves a plan, and subsequent demonstrated efforts to implement plan with active participation by parents, guardians, and other responsible adults. - Treatment involves teaching and support of efforts by parents, guardians, and other responsible adults, and those activities specifically identified within the treatment plan as appropriate for involved mental health staff, rather than substitute care. Page 35 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) - Treatment involves ongoing integrated and supervised efforts by all service providers, which includes a lead case manager. - Potential medication needs are being addressed or considered. - Lack of improvement within a level of care is subject to careful clinical and systemic analysis by the team prior to either an increase or decrease of services or change in level of services. - Exceptions to any of the above are clearly identified with explanation or rationale and discussed with the interagency team. Page 36 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) REFERENCE FORM B Function of Home/Community Services Provision of services which are less restrictive, more flexible yet effectively provides therapeutic supports for patients discharged from in-patient, residential treatment facilities, or partial hospitalization. In this way home/community services provide for the delivery of transitional care from a more restrictive setting. Prevent the need for more restrictive or higher level of services. To help the child develop the necessary self-control, and/or capacity for constructive expression, including cultivating more adaptive interpersonal skills for effective participation in the child's natural setting. Provision of service for children with mental and/or psychosocial disorders who require treatment directly in the setting wher e symptoms typically manifest, to remain stable and ensure the effectiveness of a treatment plan. Provision of after-school service for children with mental and/or psychosocial disorders, so that: parents/guardians can develop the behavioral patterns necessary to provide the additional support necessary to maintain a therapeutic environment for the child; parents/guardians can receive family therapy consistent with the treatment of their child. Should service involve a child removed from school during regular school hours, this service, and any subsequent plan to continue service during this time, must be documented with an explanation of the child's condition which necessitates such intervention. Treatment components include: major diagnostic evaluations, medical and psychiatric treatment, and psychosocial rehabilitation. Recognizing the responsibility of the Department of Education to provide an educational program for all children, the therapist must collaborate with the school or school district, but only when appropriate and as necessary to assist in the child's Individualized Education Plan when one has been or should be developed. Where such collaboration is desired but not possible the reasons must be clearly documented. Page 37 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) Treatment Range - Home/community treatment varies in intensity, duration and purpose. Intensity may be reflected in the number and length of visits as well as the professional level of the service. The duration and types of service offered will vary according to the severity of the child's symptomatology and the complexity of the intervention required as described in the treatment plan. The range of service includes therapeutic support identified in four levels corre sponding with the levels of severity established for Severe (but Inpatient Treatment not required), Residential Treatment Facility, Partial Hospitalization, and Outpatient Treatment, where clinical judgement suggests that outpatient treatment is therapeutically necessary to return the child to, or maintain the child in a stable condition. Home/community treatment may serve as a step-down from inpatient treatment, a residential treatment facility, and partial hospitalization, and to prevent the need for a more restrictive treatment setting. It also serves children, and their families, experi encing distress who may need the therapeutic support of short term services to ameliorate the presiding condition or stress. Page 38 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) REFERENCE FORM C Continued Stay Service Documentation For Mental Health Services The following list of information should be documented for the four service levels. 1. Routine evaluations and treatment updates chart child's progress. 2. The establishment and documentation of active treatment must include, the implementation of the treatment plan, the therapy provided, documentation of the family's participation and interagency collaboration, cultural competency, and active disc harge planning. 3. Current active treatment is focused upon stabilizing or reversing symptoms necessitating admission. 4. Current active treatment is focused on ameliorating symptoms and increasing the child's level of functioning. 5. The level of professional expertise and intervention are appropriate to address the child's current condition(s). 6. The initial discharge guidelines formulated for the child have been reviewed and revised, as necessary in the course of developing the discharge plan. 7. The treatment plan and strengths -based evaluation has been updated to reflect the child's progress, medication status, continuing needs and the provider's efforts to meet the identified needs. The treatment plan addresses any necessary therapeutic supports for the child's successful transition into the community, including mental health, substance abuse, intellectual disabilities and other community -based services, and the natural resources of the family. It incorporates a plan to form appropriate transitional linkages in preparation for discharge to less intrusive and non-restrictive services. 8. The treatment team programmatically reduces intensity of treatment as the child progresses toward the expected date of discharge, and through working with an interagency team forms linkages with community and family supports. 9. Type, duration and frequency of services provided to the child, and the outcome of each service must be well documented, i.e.- individual, group and family therapy; education, training and community involvement; family participation in treatment; any special activities; and medication administration and monitoring. Page 39 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.2) 10. As the child improves clinically, active treatment facilitates and increases contact of the child with the community (including home and school) to which the child will return. 11. The provision of services supports the child's involvement in age appropriate activities and interests as outlined in the treatment plan. 12. In special programs where the child does not attend the local school, there must be a current Individualized Education Plan and/or plan to provide the child an educational program in collaboration with the local school or school district on record at the PRTF. 13. Family (parent, guardian or custodian) is actively involved in the treatment planning and/or process. Should conditions prevent the possibility of such involvement, attempts to involve parents and/or reasons explaining their non -involvement must be fully documented and presented to an interagency team. 14. Continued inpatient hospitalization must be recommended by the treatment team (to also include child, parent/guardian, case manager [when one is assigned], current treating or evaluating therapist). 15. All appropriate documentation follows the child as the child makes the transition to other therapeutic services, be they more or less intense.

Utilization of the FBMHS program occurs following referral for this service and the subsequent determination by the FBMHS treatment team that the service is clinically appropriate. FBMHS is available to children who are at risk for out -of-home placement due to a severe emotional or behavioral disorder, or due to a severe mental illness. FBMHS is also used as a step-down for children returning to their family, which may include natural or substitute care families, following out-of-home placement. These Family Based Mental Health Services Program guidelines for medical necessity (and its subsequent revisions) provide a basis for the referral of children and their families for this service. [See FBMHS program standards in State Plan Under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, Amendment, Effective Date July 1, 1990 Attachment 3.1A, Section 13.(d)(I), available in the HealthChoices Proposers' Library]. PROGRAM PHILOSOPHY & ORGANIZATION: Consistent with the CASSP principles and philosophy, the guiding tenets of FBMHS are that children grow -up best in their own home, that the family is a resource and partner in the treatment process, that treatment utilizes strengths in addressing areas of need and concern, and that coordination among other human service systems and with the community is essential. In addition, while the child receives treatment, services also work to enhance the family role as a resource and partner in the treatment process. Page 2 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.3) The Family Based Mental Health Services Program is a discrete service provided by a team composed of either two child mental health professionals or one child mental health professional and a child mental health worker, which is comprehensive in scope, incorporating intensive home therapy, casework services, family support services and 24 hour, 7 day availability for crisis stabilization. Each team maintains a caseload of up to eight (8) families to ensure the intensity of service and team availability to the families they serve. Team members receive supervision together as an integral part of an ongoing program for the families served. In addition, there is an ongoing training curriculum that extends over a three year period designed specifically for Family Based Mental Health Service Team members. The service is broadly conceived for flexible use in the home and community. The specific frequency and schedule of face-to-face contacts are developed collaboratively with the family, based on needs at that time. This allows the team to provide for individual family needs when they are closely associated with the child's treatment, such as time for family education/training regarding therapeutic components and skill building for the child and family. The team also works with the family to identify resources available to them. Teams are available to provide 24 hour service, and they also work with other systems when they are involved with the child and family, such as Drug and Alcohol Services, Children and Youth, Juvenile Justice, special education, etc. Clinical treatment within FBMHS is guided by the recognition of the normal growth and development of children at different ages, and supports family caretaking and functioning through collaborative, conjoint family meetings, which can include different combinations of family members and community members as indicated. Due to its commitment to support both the develo pment of children and the integrity of the family, FBMHS, while primarily treatment, also serves a preventive function. The needs of all the children within a family, not just the child in response to whom services were initiated, are actively considered and included as part of the treatment process. Services offered by the FBMHS program include formal individual and family therapy sessions with the child and/or family. In addition, program service requirements include the following: - Crisis intervention and stabilization; - Emergency availability; - Ongoing information -gathering in support of active treatment; Page 3 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.3) - Collaborative development and modification of the treatment plan; - Clinical intervention by each team member with the child in attaining identified treatment goals and objectives within the treatment plan, including: remediation of child's symptoms (i.e. behavioral, affective, cognitive, thought impairments, etc.), improvement of family relationships, community integration, and other aspects of psychosocial competence and skill development in the home, school, or community; - Support for the parents in implementing effective behavior management and parenting approaches specific to the presenting problems of their child; - School -based consultation and intervention as needed; - Referral, coordination, and linkage to other agencies, social services, and community services, as appropriate; - Assistance in obtaining relief services such as babysitters, homemakers, respite care and supportive services such as transportation and recreation, and developing a network in order to receive thes e services. The Family Support Service (FSS) is a requirement in the Family Based Mental Health Services Program under Health Choices. Family -Based Family Support Services (FBMHS) are formal and informal services or tangible goods which are needed to enable a family to care for and live with a child who has a serious emotional disturbance. FBMHS/FSS include supportive services and tangible goods, which facilitate achievement of the child's treatment goals. If a child is in temporary out-of-home placement, FBMHS/FSS should be used to facilitate the return of the child to the natural family and in this instance should be available to both the natural family as well as the foster family. A cost component for FBMH/FSS is built into the HealthChoices capitation rate. As such, it is recommended that the provider and the BH-MCO agree to a method for setting aside an appropriate percentage of the FBMHS provider fee for the purchase of services or goods needed to further the child's treatment goals. The FBMHS budget identifies administrative and program costs which include family support services. Page 4 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 Appendix T (Part B.3) - The FBMHS unit of service is billed for activities or direct services which are provided by the Family -Based team members using existing procedure codes. Only such FBMHS units are reported as encounter data. - There is no separate reporting requirement for FBMH Family Support Services. - The provider must have an accounting system that identifies revenue sources and expenditures.

The child/adolescent or family receiving the service determines that targeted case management is no longer wanted, even though, the child/adolescent does meet continued stay criteria; or D. the child/adolescent and family has moved outside of the current geographical service area (e.g., county, state, country). Page 3 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 TCM Child & Adolescent, Appendix T (Part B.4) Appendix T Part B (4) TCM ENVIRONMENTAL MATRIX \u2014CHILDREN INSTRUCTIONS The Environmental Matrix \u2014 Children is a scale that evaluates the functional and need levels of children and adolescents who are under the age of 18 years old or who are over 18 years of age but who are still attending a school program. Note: Adolescents age 16 - 22 may be assessed on either the child/adolescent environmental matrix or the adult environmental matrix, depending on the adolescent's current circumstances. The parent/guardian and adolescent, in discussion with the reviewer, should determine which Environmental Matrix will be used. The child/adolescent and family and/or guardian or care giver/natural support must be assessed in a face to face interview assessment with the evaluator. Cultural competency will be recognized throughout the entire evaluation process and the entire document. Individuals should be reassessed as needed, but no less than every six months. There are ten (10) assessment areas identified in relationship to Targeted Case Management services: 1. Accessing Mental Health Services 2. Informal Support Network Building 3. Education/Vocation 4. Children and Youth System Involvement 5. Juvenile Justice/Criminal Justice System Involvement 6. Parent/Guardian and/or Other Family Members with Significant Family Needs. 7. Drug and Alcohol System Involvement 8. Mental Retardation System Involvement 9. Physical Health System Involvement 10a. At Risk of Out-of-Home Placement Or 10b. Currently in RTF, Other Out of Home Placements or Inpatient Please note: Although items 10a. and 10b. both deal with residential placement, scoring is done for only one of the items , either item 10a. or item 10b., since only one of these items can be relevant to the child/adolescent's current residential status. The scale has a range from 0 to 5 with the following values for each activity: 0 1 2 3 4 5 No assistance Minimum of Needs moderate Needs significant needed assistance assistance in this assistance in this area needed area Page 4 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 TCM Child & Adolescent, Appendix T (Part B.4) Appendix T Part B (4) All ten assessment areas are ranked on the above scale. The evaluator must complete the environmental matrix in a face-to-face, strengths -based assessment interview with the child/adolescent and his/her family and/or guardian, or care giver/natural support. Evaluators should incorporate in their assessment a recognition/determination of cultural strengths (i.e., extended family, resourcefulness and responsibility). The evaluator should consider the child's/adolescent's and parent's/guardian's (family) strengths and needs in the following life domains for each assessment area in order to produce a score that reflects the fu ll dimension of need: . Housing/living situation . of daily living . Medical treatment Each assessment area is defined at the \" 1\", \" 3 \", and \" 5 \" levels (See attached Environmental Matrix) and the subtotal score is divided by 10 to obtain the EM Score (when scoring the individual, refer to the Environmental Matrix TCM Scoring Grid which identifies the expected frequency of TCM contact needed for the individual for that particular assessment area). Scoring levels may be gradated to the 0.5 level only; this allows for minor differentiation of the child's/adolescent's needs without compromising the integrity of the scale. Looking at the behavior, inclusive of the lowest level of functioning, and situation of the child/adolescent during the last ninety (90) days, rate the child's/adolescent's need for TCM in each of the ten areas. Please note that the rating for each area should be made in whole numbers; in cases where there are extraordinary factors that make the assignment of whole numbers extremely difficult, if not impossible, 0.5 points may be added to or subtracted from the base scores. The sum of the ten (10) scores should then be taken and divided by 10 and the resulting subtotal score should be reviewed and compared to other known factors that may affect the consumer's need for service. Note: If a particular assessment area does not apply to the individual being assessed, a score should not be given for that assessment area and the total score should be divided by the number of assessment areas scored. This should be noted on the scoring sheet. If after averaging the scores, the average is lower by at least 2 points than any one value given in any one assessment area (e.g., if a person's average is 2 and he/she received a score of 4 in any one area), the evaluator must provide written justification for assignment to the level that corresponds to the average, rather than the higher value. The Environmental Matrix score, your professional judgement *, and other information (e.g., cultural factors, records of past treatment, etc.) that impacts on the child's/adolescent's level of need should then be considered and the recommended Page 5 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 TCM Child & Adolescent, Appendix T (Part B.4) Appendix T Part B (4) level of TCM service should be entered on the recommended level of TCM line of the scoring sheet. (These levels are consistent with minimum levels of contact as defined in Chapter 5221, Intensive Case Managemen t regulations and bulletin OMH -93-09, Resource Coordination: Implementation .) If the recommended level of TCM services differs from the Environmental Matrix Score, the difference must be justified with professional judgement in the \"Other Factors/Issues Affecting Score\" section of the scoring sheet. Note: The level of service indicated by the assessment represents the individuals needs at the time of the assessment. Service intensity could change as an individual's needs and/or desires for service change. Please note: ENVIRONMENTAL MATRIX \u2014 CHILD/ADOLESCENT TCM SERVICE SCORING GRID MATRI X LEVEL NEED LEVEL INTENSITY OF CARE 4.0 -5.0 ICM At least 1 contact every 14 days (Face to face contact strongly recommended). 1.5 -3.9 RC At least 1 contact every 30 days (Face to Face) 0.0 - 1.4 NO TCM NEEDED Alternative services may be needed and if necessary, referrals should be made. * professional judgement: opinion based on a thorough and ethical analysis of facts, data, history, and issues in accordance with one's training and experience. ACCESSING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES Child's/adolescent's mental health problems require mental health services and the family requires help to access them. The TCM should take into consideration that the behavioral health system may pose a number of barriers which serve as obstacles to assessing services (e.g., language, perceived/actual institutional racism/discrimination, the family may mistrust the behavioral health system, the family may lack the capability to access services, the family may lack information, be overwhelmed, poorly informed about the benefits of such services, or intimidated by the system). The TCM is instrumental in assuring that the child/adolescent receives the necessary services for therapy, medication monitoring, etc. Page 6 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 202 1 TCM Child & Adolescent, Appendix T (Part B.4) Appendix T Part B (4) The decision for level of TCM needed in this area must be determined in collaboration with family and/or guardian, or care giver/natural support and child/adolescent. 0 1 2 3 4 5 Needs minimal Needs moderate Needs significant assistance in this area assistance in this area assistance in this area 0= Parent/guardian and child/adolescent does not require/desire any assistance in this area. 1= Parent/guardian and child/adolescent requires/desires a minimal level of assistance, guidance and support to obtain mental health and other essential services to meet the child's/adolescent's multiple needs. 3= Parent/guardian and child/adolescent requires/desires a moderate level of assistance, guidance and support to obtain mental health and other essential services to meet the child's/adolescent's multiple needs. 5= Parent/guardian and child/adolescent requires/desires a significant level of assistance, guidance and support to obtain mental health and other essential services to meet the child's/adolescent's multiple needs. INFORMAL SUPPORT NETWORK BUILDING The child/adolescent and parent/guardian identifies, communicates, and interacts with family, friends, significant others, and community groups from whom the child/adolescent may gain informal support. Service system barriers and other factors, however, may impede the child/adolescent and parent/guardian from interacting with family, friends, significant others and community groups. The child/adolescent may need assistance to challenge and remove barriers so as to enhance the informal building of supports. The child/adolescent may need the assistance of the targeted case manager and/or others to identify, enhance and/or maintain existing relationships and the encouragement to develop new ones. The decision for level of TCM needed in this area must be determined in collaboration with family and/or guardian, or care giver/natural support and child/adolescent.

Appendix U HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix U 1 VALUE BASED PURCHASING Value -based Purchasing (VBP) is the Department's initiative to transition Providers from volume to value payment models for the delivery of behavioral health services. VBP Payment Strategies and VBP Models are critical for improving quality of care, efficiency of services and reducing costs. The Department has developed an aligned VBP framework that consists of both VBP Payment Strategies and VBP Models. VBP Payment Strategies define the mechanism by which the P roviders are paid by the BH- MCO. VBP Payment Strategies are tiered by three levels of risk : low, medium, and high. VBP Models define a way to organize and deliver care and may incorporate one or more VBP Payment Strategies as ways to pay Providers. The Department is categorizing VBP Models into recommended models and required models. PH-MCOs, Primary Contractors and their BH- MCOs, CHC- MCOs, and CHIP - MCOs can form integrated VBP Models. Primary Contractors and BH -MCOs should work towards integrating VBP M odels because addressing behavioral health needs can improve physical health outcomes, and vice versa. Additionally, Primary Contractors are required to incorporate Community - Based Organizations within VBP agreements to help address the Social Determinants of H ealth (SDOH) . Definitions : VBP Payment Arrangement : An agreement which link s Provider payments for services to the value of services provided and to relevant quality measures that are indicative of health outcomes. VBP Payment Strateg y: The mechanism that is used to pay a Provider (such as Performance- based Contracting, Shared Savings, Shared Risk, Bundled Payment and G lobal Payment ). VBP Model: A way to organize and deliver care that may incorporate one or more VBP Payment Strategies as a ways to pay a P rovider. A. VBP Payment Strategies The Primary Contractor and its BH- MCO must enter into VBP Payment Arrangements with Providers that incorporate approved VBP Payment Appendix U HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix U 2 Strategies. The Department retains the ability to accept or reject any proposals to count toward the required VBP medical spend percentage. The approved VBP Payment Strategies are tiered as low -risk ( Performance -based Contracting), medium risk ( Shared Savings, Shared Risk, Bundled Payments), and high risk (comprehensive Global Payments ). VBP Payment Arrangement s must include quality benchmarks containing financial incentives or penalties , or both, without which the Department will reject the arrangement as counting towards the required VBP medical spend percentage. Primary Contractors and BH -MCOs can also layer additional non- financial incentives, such as the elimination of prior authorization requirements for high- performing Providers, as long as financial incentives are also in the arrangement. Approved VBP Payment Strategies Performance- based Contracting (low- risk strategy) - FFS contracts in which incentive payment s and/or penalties are linked to performance. The Primary Contractor and its BH -MCO must measure performance against quality benchmarks or incremental improvement benchmarks and must include in the contract incentives or penalties , or both , based upon meeting these benchmarks. Shared Savings (medium -risk strategy) - Supplemental payments if they are able to reduce health care spending relative to an annual cost benchmark, either for a defined Member sub- population or the total Member population served. The cost benchmark should be developed prospectively, based at least in part on historical claims, and be risk adjusted if needed for a defined patient population relative to a benchmark. The supplemental payment is a percentage of the net savings generated. Shared Risk (medium -risk strategy) - Supplemental payments if health care spending is reduced relative to a cost benchmark, either for a defined Member sub-population or the total Member population. The cost benchmark should be developed prospectively, based at least in part on historical claims, and be risk adjusted if needed. The payment is a per centage of the net savings generated. These arrangements also include shared losses if costs are higher relative to a benchmark. Bundled Payments (medium -risk strategy) - Bundled payments include all payments for services rendered to treat a Member for an identified condition during a specific time period. The payments may either be made in bulk or be paid over regular predetermined intervals. Bundled Payments should be ris k adjusted if appropriate. The Department may specify certain services that must be paid through B undled Payments. Global Payment s (high- risk strategy) - Population- based payments that Appendix U HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix U 3 cover all services rendered by a Network Provider, hospital, or health system . An annual global budget is developed prospectively . These payments can either be made in bulk, delivered over regular predetermined intervals, or based on fee- for-service payme nts with retrospective reconciliation to the global budget. If these payments are retrospective, at least a portion of the payment must be prospective to allow for upfront investments in population health infrastructure. Global Payments should link payments to both improved physical health and behavioral health quality measures and provide incentives to reduce potentially avoidable utilization and address SDOH. Global P ayments must also take into consideration market shift on an annual basis, to ensure that Network Providers are not simply decreasing the amount of care provided. Network Providers who are paid via G lobal Payments are excluded from participating in B undled Payment arrangements, because this would result in a duplication of payment for serv ices rendered. The r eduction of prior authorization requirements should be considered for Network Providers who are paid via G lobal Payments. B. VBP Required Models Primary Contractors and their BH -MCOs must participate in required VBP payment models as specified by the Department and work with the Department on the development of new models . VBP Payment Arrangements outside of the required models may also be adopted. Standardized Transitions to Community (TC) - The TC Model is a structure that standardizes performance measures to better support care transitions from psychiatric inpatient (IP) discharge to community -based services across the entire healthcare system. Requirements include (1) standardized performance measures tied to payment for IP P roviders and (2) standardized data collection for outpatient (OP), Behavioral Health Home Programs (BHHP), and Case Management VBP models to link natural pathways of care that can structure standardization of attribution for VBP arrangements. The required standardized measures are: Follow up after Hospitalization (FUH) for mental illness \u2014 The measure identifies the percentage of members who received follow- up within 7 days and 30 days of discharge. PA Specific Readmis sion \u2014 the percentage of acute inpatient stays for psychiatric care with subsequent readmission to inpatient acute psychiatric care within 3 0 days of the initial inpatient acute psychiatric discharge. Appendix U HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix U 4 C. Financial Goals The financial goals for the VBP Payment Strategies for each Contract Year are based on a percentage of the Primary Contractor's VBP expenditures to total medical expenses. The Primary Contractor must achieve the following percentages through VBP payment arrangements: Contract Year 2021: 20% of the medical expenses must be expended through VBP payment strategies. At least 50% of the 20% of medical expenses must be from a combination of medium or high financial risk categories The Primary Contractor and its BH -MCO must incorporate Community Based Organizations (CBOs) into VBP arrangements with Network Providers to address SDOH as follows: o By March 1, 2021, at least 25% of VBP Payment Strategies that are medium risk and high risk must incorporate at least one CBO that addresses at least one SDOH Domain. o By June 1, 2021, at least 50% of VBP Payment Strategies that are medium risk and high risk must incorporate at least one CBO that addresses at least one S DOH Domain. o By September 1, 2021, at least 75% of VBP Payment Strategies that are medium risk and high risk must incorporate at least one CBO that addresses at least one SDOH D omain, and 25% of VBP Payment Strategies that are medium risk and high risk should incorporate one or more CBOs that together address 2 or more SDOH domains. The Primary Contractor and its BH -MCO must require the CBO to address at least one of the following SDOH domains, which are included in the statewide resource and referral tool: o Childcare access and affordability o Clothing o Employment o Financial strain o Food insecurity Appendix U HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix U 5 o Housing instability/homelessness o Transportation o Utilities Additionally, in determining which CBOs to incorporate into VBP agreements, the Primary Contractor/ and its BH- MCO should also consider the following characteristics of CBOs: o Types of services provided o Accessibility to community members, including hours of operation, location, staffing capacity, accommodations for individuals with special needs including physical disabilities and language barriers o Number of MA participants served o Quality of social servi ces provided and experience addressing SDOH o Soundness of fiscal, operational and administrative practices and capacity o Service area and populations served o Capacity for increased referrals from P roviders or the BH-MCO o Ability to capture and report SDOH data The Primary Contractor and its BH -MCO must incorporate CBOs into VBP arrangements by either: o Contracting with a CBO directly; or o Contracting with a Network Provider that subcontracts with a CBO. E. Reporting The Department will measure compliance with the financial goals set forth in this appendix using the following required documents of which the content and/or format will be defined by the Department: Proposed VBP plan Annual summary The Department will review the plan and summary and provide feedback to the Primary Contractor. By October 1 of the preceding Contract Year, the Primary Contractor must submit its proposed VBP plan to the Department . The proposed VBP plan must outline and describe the Primary Contractor' s plan for compliance for the next Appendix U HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix U 6 Contract Year. Primary Contractor should monitor the VBP payment arrangements continuously, but no less than quarterly, and provide updates to OMHSAS as requested. By June 30 of the subsequent Contract Year, the Primary Contractor must submit an annual summary using the OMHSAS Template that includes the following: A review of the accomplishments and outcomes from the prior C ontract Year; A report on the percentage of medical expenses expended through VBP strategies and the associated levels of financial risk; and A VBP detail report by P rovider that identifies the following: o Level of financial risk (no, low, medium , high) and Dollar amount spent for medical services expended; o VBP Payment Strategy/M odel(s) used; o Program type(s) i ncluded (Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers (FQHC), Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) and Behavioral Heath Homes, etc.), if applicable; o CBOs and S DOH domains included; and o Evidence- based Practices and Programs ( EBPP) [must be on the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) list of approved EBPPs and adhere to fidelity requirements] F. Assessment This section provides for an assessment against the Primary Contractor's Capitation payment if the annual medical spend requirement is not met. There will be no assessment for not meeting the CBO requirement. Not later than ninety (90) calendar days after receipt of the VBP annual summary from the Primary Contractor the Department will notify the Primary Contractor of its determination about compliance with the goal for the preceding C ontract Year. The Primary Contractor may provide a response within thirty (30) calendar days. After considering the response from the Primary Contractor, if any, the Department will notify the Primary Contractor of its final determination of compliance. If the determination results in a finding of non- compliance, the Department will reduce the next monthly Capitation payment by an amount equivalent to one (1) percent of the medical portion of the Capitation payments it paid to the Primary Contractor for the last month of the prior C ontract Year. Appendix U HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix U 7 If the Primary Contractor fail s to provide a timely and adequate VBP annual summary, the Department may determine that the Primary Contractor and is not compliant with the goal of the preceding C ontract Year. G. Data Sharing The Primary Contr actor must provide timely and actionable data to its P roviders participating in VBP arrangements. Provider performance baseline measures, results and progress toward goals must be established and shared with P roviders quarterly. Provider results must be published in the P rovider profile reports. Service utilization and claim data across the clinical service spectrum must be analyzed for cost and treatment efficacy. Appendix V HC HB Program Standards & Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix V Page 1 HEALTHCHOICES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RECIPIENT COVERAGE DOCUMENT UBackground This document includes descriptions of policies supported by the Department of Human Services (Department) data systems and processes. In cases where the policy expressed in this document conflicts with another provision of the contract (i.e., the Department Agreement) between the Primary Contractor and the Department, the Agreement will take precedence. The Department will provide sufficient information to the Primary Contractor in order for it to reconcile Behavioral Health Managed Care Organization (BH- MCO) membership data and amounts paid to/ recovered from the Primary Contractor. Instances of Medical Assistance (MA) coverage for a recipient do not imply corresponding HealthChoices coverage on the same dates by a BH-MCO. Because not all persons eligible for MA benefits are also eligible for BH- MCO membership on the same date, MA eligibility does not equate to BH- MCO coverage. Instances of simultaneous MA eligibility and BH-MCO coverage for a recipient do not imply corresponding HealthChoices coverage on the same dates by a Physical Health Managed Care Organization ( PH-MCO) or a Community HealthChoices Managed Care Organization (CHCMCO). Please refer to the PH-MCO Recipient Coverage Document (Exhibit BB of the HealthChoices Physical Health Agreement) for physical health coverage guidelines - and CHCMCO Participant Coverage Document (Exhibit K of the CHC Agreement) UCoverage Rules A BH-MCO is responsible for a member if coverage is determined by applying the general rules found in any of paragraphs A, B, or C below, subject to exceptions and clarifications found in paragraphs D, E, F, G, H and I. A. Unless otherwise specified, the BH-MCO is responsible to provide MA behavioral health benefits to BH-MCO Members in accordance with eligibility information included on the Monthly Membership File and/or the Daily Membership File, which is provided by the Department to each BH- MCO. B. Monthly Membership Files containing information on Members are created on the next to the last Saturday of each month and are normally provided to the BH-MCO no later than the following Monday. Information on the file includes retroactive, current or prospective eligibility periods, PH-MCO coverage and BH-MCO coverage, and demographic data. For each BH-MCO member identified on the Monthly Membership File, the BH-MCO is responsible to provide behavioral health benefits from the beginning of the month or from the BH-MCO coverage start date, whichever is later. BH-MCO coverage will continue from the start date through the last day of the calendar month unless the Department subsequently sends the BH-MCO updated information on a Daily Membership File. BHMCO coverage beyond the last date of the month in which a Monthly Membership File is created is Appendix V HC HB Program Standards & Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix V Page 2 preliminary information that is subject to change. Daily Membership Files are provided to each BH-MCO with changes that have been applied to their enrolled population. In the example that follows, assume that the only information provided by the Department is on the November Monthly Membership File (created in late October). If an eligibility period of October 11 through November 18 is provided, the BH- MCO is responsible from October 11 through November 30, assuming no subsequent daily file changes occur prior to November 1 to end the coverage in October. If two eligibility periods are provided (e.g., one from October 11 through October 25 and one from October 29 on with no end date), the BH- MCO is responsible from October 11 through at least November 30, subject to a daily file change prior to November 1. Coverage after October 31 is preliminary based on daily file changes. If a Recipient is shown on the Department's Client Information System (CIS) as covered by a BH- MCO (coverage by a BH- MCO is indicated by an open MA eligibility record and a corresponding open BH-MCO record), the BH-MCO is responsible for the person from the first day of BH-MCO coverage through the last day of the month of the BH-MCO end date (if any). The Department will pay the Primary Contractor from the first day of coverage in a month through the last calendar day of the month. Because a recipient may lose MA eligibility (and potentially regain MA eligibility), information on CIS for any future date should be viewed as preliminary. If a Recipient has eligibility in more than one county during the month, the BH-MCO with the earliest period of responsibility is responsible for providing services for the month. A recipient who becomes ineligible for MA will lose BH-MCO coverage. If a recipient subsequently regains MA eligibility, and the recipient's category of assistance and geographic location remain valid, the recipient will be auto- assigned back into BH-MCO coverage. Upon regaining MA eligibility, the recipient's BH-MCO effective date will be their MA eligibility begin date or the date CIS is updated (i.e., the systems date), whichever is later. The change in MA eligibility will normally result in a period of MA Fee-For- Service coverage for the MA recipient's behavioral health coverage. This is so because even in the case of retroactive MA eligibility, there is no assignment of retroactive BH-MCO coverage. MA eligibility does not equate to BH-MCO coverage. Periods of time where a person is MA eligible yet where there is no corresponding BH-MCO coverage on the same date is normal, so providers and BH-MCOs must plan accordingly in the authorization, delivery and payment of services. This will include coverage for children placed in a Residential Treatment Facility (RTF), who lose BH-MCO coverage and become covered under the MA Fee-For-Service (FFS) Program. In these and other scenarios, barring those cases identified in Section D below, the BH-MCO is not responsible for MA recipients for whom the Department has informed the BH-MCO on Monthly and/or Daily Eligibility Files that it has no responsibility. C. The Department has established benefit packages based on category of assistance, program status code, age, and for some packages, the existence of Medicare coverage or a Deprivation Qualifying Code. In cases where the Recipient benefits are determined by the benefit package, the most comprehensive package is to be honored. For example, if a Recipient has the most comprehensive package on the first of the month but changes to a lesser level package during the month, they should receive the higher level of benefits for the entire month. If a Recipient has a lesser level benefit package at the beginning of the Appendix V HC HB Program Standards & Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix V Page 3 month but changes to a higher level during the month, they should receive the higher level benefits effective the first day of coverage under the higher level. The daily and monthly files can be used for determining increased benefits during a month. D. BH-MCO Coverage Exceptions and Clarifications: 1. The BH-MCO will not be responsible and will not be paid when the Department sends the BH-MCO correspondence specifying member months for which they are not responsible. The Department will recover capitation payments made for a Recipient for whom it had been determined the BH-MCO was not responsible to provide services. 2. In the unlikely case where CIS shows FFS coverage that coincides with BH-MCO coverage, the Recipient may use either coverage and there will be no monetary adjustment between the Department and the BH-MCO. (This is subordinate to #8 below.) 3. If the BH-MCO receives information about changes in a Recipient's circumstances that may affect the Recipient's eligibility, including changes in a Recipient's residence or death of a Recipient, the BH-MCO shall promptly notify the CAO and the Department. The BH-MCO shall also promptly notify the CAO and the Department if the BH-MCO receives information that a Recipient is deceased and if such Recipient is shown on either the Monthly Membership File or the Daily Membership File as active. The Department will recover capitation payments made for deceased Recipients after the service month in which the date of death occurred. 4. If it is determined that the member was not MA eligible on the begin date of coverage during a month, and the BH-MCO was paid, the Department will recover or adjust capitation payments. 5. If a member is placed in a setting that results in the termination of coverage by the BH-MCO (e.g., State Mental Hospital), the Department will recover capitation payments made for the member after the service month in which the termination of coverage occurred. 6. The BH-MCO retains responsibility for Members when placed outside the county, HealthChoices zone or state by the BH-MCO, juvenile court or county Children and Youth (C&Y) even if PH-MCO coverage information is not found on CIS, the daily or monthly eligibility files. The BH-MCO will continue to receive capitation payments. If a member is placed in a facility by juvenile court or county C&Y authority for service(s) which the BH-MCO determines is not medically necessary, the cost of the service is the responsibility of the placing authority, not the BH-MCO. (See Section H for additional details). 7. Newborn babies are the responsibility of the BH-MCO that covered the mother on Appendix V HC HB Program Standards & Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix V Page 4 the date of birth. Where CIS does not reflect this, if the PH-MCO notifies the Department, the Department will coordinate adjustment of coverage. Limitations in Sections E-2 and E-3 applicable to the mother will apply to the newborn. 8. Placement out of a BH-MCO's service area, or lack of MA coverage or eligibility on a date of service for which the policies in this document otherwise hold a BHMCO responsible for a Recipient do not negate a BH-MCO's responsibility to provide MA benefits. If a BH-MCO is aware that a Recipient is placed outside of its county, it is the BH-MCO's responsibility to notify the CAO, within ten (10) days of the date of learning of the Recipient's status. Gaps in the notification process may result in loss of BH-MCO coverage, and MA FFS coverage will apply. 9. If the rules to determine BH-MCO responsibility to provide benefits to MA Members that are outlined in this document indicate that a BH-MCO is responsible to provide benefits to a MA Recipient on a certain date, a lack of MA eligibility indicated on CIS for that date does not negate this responsibility. 10. Errors in coverage must be reported to the Department within 45 days of receipt of the monthly eligibility file in order for retroactive changes to be considered. The BH-MCO will be responsible to cover Members, even when coverage assignment resulted from errors, if not reported to the Department within 45 days unless the error results in duplicate payment or coverage. 11. If CIS shows an exemption or facility/placement code (e.g., facility/placement code 14 - State Mental Hospital) that precludes BH-MCO coverage, the Recipient may not be enrolled in a BH-MCO. E. When a Recipient has managed care coverage during part of an inpatient/residential stay, financial responsibility* is as follows: For purposes of this document, an inpatient/residential stay shall include those in the following facilities: General Hospital Rehabilitation Hospital Acute Care Hospital (PT 01 - Spec 010) Private Psychiatric Hospital (PT 01 - Spec 011) Residential Treatment Facility - Accredited (PT 01 - Spec 013) Extended Acute Care Psychiatric Hospital (PT 18 - Spec 018) Drug & Alcohol Rehab Hospital (PT 01 - Spec 019) Private Psychiatric Unit (PT 01 - Spec 022) Drug & Alcohol Rehab Unit (PT 01 - Spec 441) Residential Treatment Facility - Non-Accredited (PT 56 - Spec 560) *The covering plan will only be responsible for inpatient/residential services for continuous stays when the service is included as a covered service under its contract with the Department. 1. Inpatient/residential Facilities Covered Under the Prospective Payment System for Appendix V HC HB Program Standards & Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix V Page 5 Diagnostic Related Groups. If a Recipient is in a facility covered by a DRG and is FFS on the admission date (or determined eligible through a retroactive determination by the CAO) and the BH-MCO coverage begins while the Recipient is in the inpatient/residential facility, the FFS program is financially responsible for the entire initial stay. The BH-MCO will become financially responsible for the member upon discharge. Upon becoming aware of a new member currently in one of these facilities, the BH-MCO must coordinate with the Provider in determining an appropriate course of treatment as soon as possible, prior to discharge. EXAMPLE: If a Recipient is determined to be covered by FFS on the admission date to an inpatient/residential facility, which is covered under the prospective payment system for Diagnostic Related Groups, on June 21, and the BH-MCO coverage begin date is July 1, and the individual is transferred/discharged on July 15, the FFS program will be financially responsible for the entire stay. The BHMCO will be financially responsible for all covered services beginning July 15. Upon becoming aware of a new member currently in a facility on July 1, the BHMCO must become involved in discharge planning for the individual. 2. Recipient Covered by FFS Becomes BH-MCO Covered While in Facility If a Recipient is covered by FFS on the admission date and the BH- MCO coverage begins while the Recipient is in an inpatient/residential facility not covered under the DRG Prospective Payment System, the FFS program is financially responsible for the stay until the BH-MCO begin date. Starting with the BH-MCO begin date, the BH-MCO is financially responsible for the remainder of the stay, as well as physician or other covered services not included in the inpatient/residential facility bill that would be their responsibility as the Recipient's BH-MCO. Upon assuming financial responsibility of a Recipient age 21 and over, the BH-MCO has the ability to conduct a concurrent review of the FFS authorized inpatient/residential facility stay to determine continued medical necessity. EXAMPLE: If a Recipient covered by FFS is admitted to an inpatient/residential facility on June 21 and the BH-MCO coverage begin date is July 1, the BH-MCO will assume payment responsibility for the inpatient/residential facility stay in July 1. The FFS program will remain financially responsible for the stay through June 30. Any time after June 30, the BH-MCO may conduct a concurrent review to determine medical necessity of the inpatient/residential facility stay if the member is an adult age 21and over. 3. Recipient Covered by BH-MCO Becomes FFS While in Facility If a Recipient is covered by a BH-MCO when admitted to an inpatient/residential facility and the Recipient loses BH-MCO coverage and assumes FFS coverage while still in the inpatient/residential facility, the BH-MCO is responsible for the stay except as indicated below. Appendix V HC HB Program Standards & Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix V Page 6 EXAMPLE #1: If the Recipient is still in the inpatient/residential facility on the FFS coverage begin date, and the Recipient's FFS coverage begin date is the first day of the month, the BH- MCO will be financially responsible for the stay through the last day of that month. The FFS program will be financially responsible for the stay beginning on the first day of the next month. For example, if a Recipient covered by the BH- MCO is admitted to an inpatient/residential facility on June 21 and the FFS program coverage begin date is July 1, the FFS program will assume payment responsibility for the inpatient/residential facility stay on August 1. The BH-MCO will remain financially responsible for the stay through July 31. EXAMPLE #2: If the Recipient is still in the inpatient/residential facility on the FFS program coverage begin date, and the Recipient's FFS program coverage begin date is any day other than the first day of the month, the BH-MCO will be financially responsible for the stay through the last day of the FOLLOWING month. The FFS program will be financially responsible for the stay beginning on the first day of the NEXT month. For example, if a Recipient covered by a BH-MCO is admitted to an inpatient/residential facility on June 21 and the FFS program coverage begin date is July 15, the FFS program will assume payment responsibility for the inpatient/residential facility stay on September 1. The BH-MCO program will remain financially responsible for the stay through August 31. 4. Recipient Covered by BH-MCO Loses MA eligibility and BH -MCO coverage while in Facility If a Recipient is covered by a BH-MCO when admitted to an inpatient/residential facility and the Recipient loses MA eligibility and BH-MCO coverage while in the inpatient/residential facility, the BH-MCO is responsible for the stay except as indicated below. EXAMPLE: #1: If the recipient is still in the inpatient/residential facility on the date the clients loses MA eligibility, the BH-MCO will be financially responsible through the end of the month in which MA eligibility is lost. The CAO subsequently reestablishes MA eligibility retroactively to the last MA eligibility end-date resulting in consecutive MA eligibility spans and the BH-MCO coverage resumes on the system store date. For example, if a Recipient covered by a BH- MCO is admitted to an inpatient/residential facility on August 26 and loses MA eligibility on August 27, the BH-MCO is responsible through August 31. (Reference D. Exceptions and Clarifications #9). The BH-MCO coverage will then resume on the system store date of October 15. If requested, MA FFS may review the case to determine medical necessity for possible FFS coverage of the stay where the dates of service were September 1 through October 14. 5. Recipient Covered by one BH-MCO Becomes Covered by a Different BH- MCO While in a Facility If a Recipient is covered by a BH-MCO when admitted to an inpatient/residential facility and transfers to another BH-MCO while still in the inpatient/residential Appendix V HC HB Program Standards & Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix V Page 7 facility, the first BH-MCO is responsible for that stay except as indicated below. EXCEPTION #1: If the Recipient is still in the inpatient/residential facility on the gaining BH-MCO coverage begin date, and the Recipient's gaining BH-MCO coverage begin date is the first day of the month, the first BH-MCO will be financially responsible for the stay through the last day of that month. The second BH-MCO will be financially responsible for the stay beginning on the first day of the next month. For example, if a Recipient is admitted to an inpatient/residential facility on June 21 and the second BH-MCO coverage begin date is July 1, the second BH-MCO will assume payment responsibility for the inpatient/residential facility stay on August 1. The first BH-MCO will remain financially responsible for the stay through July 31. EXCEPTION #2: If the Recipient is still in the inpatient/residential facility on the second BH-MCO coverage begin date, and the Recipient's second BH-MCO coverage begin date is any day other than the first day of the month, the first BHMCO will be financially responsible for the stay beginning on the first day of the NEXT month. The second BH-MCO will be financially responsible for the stay beginning on the first day of the following month. For example, if a Recipient is admitted to an inpatient/residential facility on June 21 and the second BH-MCO coverage begin date is July 15, the second BH-MCO will assume payment responsibility for the inpatient/residential facility stay on September 01. The first BH-MCO will remain financially responsible for the stay through August 31. F. When a recipient has managed care coverage during a stay in an IMD, financial responsibility is as follows. For purposes of this provision, an IMD stay is a stay in a freestanding psychiatric or substance use disorder facility with more than sixteen (16) beds by an individual age 21- 64. It does not include a stay in the following: Acute Care Hospital (PT 01 - Spec 010) Private Psychiatric Unit within a General Hospital (PT 01- Spec 022) If a Member between the ages of 21 and 64 is eligible for MA on the first day of the month, the BH-MCO is responsible for all services for the entire month. If a member between the ages of 21 and 64 stays in a psychiatric IMD for longer than fifteen (15) cumulative days within a month, a capitation recoupment will be processed for the entire month the Member is an inpatient in the psychiatric IMD and the Prim ary Contractor and its BH -MCO will receive a separate pro-rated capitation payment for the days of the month in which the Member was not in a psychiatric IMD facility . If a Member between the ages of 21 and 64 stays in a psychiatric IMD for fifteen (15) c umulative days or fewer within a month, the Primary Contractor may retain the capitation payment. A capitation recoupment will not be processed for stays longer than fifteen (15) cumulative days in substance use disorder facilities. G. Other Causes for Coverage Termination: 1. UNursing Facility U- BH-MCO Members are disenrolled after 30 consecutive days of Appendix V HC HB Program Standards & Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix V Page 8 placement in a nursing facility. This includes cases where the CAO enters a facility code placement on a client's record with a retroactive begin date and the BH-MCO record remains opened, the Department will take into consideration the 30 days from the begin date of the placement prior to end-dating BH-MCO coverage. Example: A recipient is determined BH-MCO eligible beginning January 1 and is admitted to a nursing facility on February 17. On February 28 the CAO retrospectively enters a facility placement code of \"36\" onto the recipient's CIS record (CIS systems date = 02/28) with a placement begin date of February 17. The BH-MCO record will remain open for the period of January 1 through March 18 before end-dating; with the last 30 days of BH-MCO coverage corresponding to the first 30 consecutive days of nursing facility placement. 2. UAging Waiver U(also known as UPennsylvania Department of Aging (PDA) Waiver) U BH-MCO Members are disenrolled thirty (30) days after enrollment in the Aging Waiver. EXCEPTION: G. 1 and G.2 changes will be applicable with the following effective dates: January 1, 2018 - G.1 and G.2 will no longer be applicable for the following counties: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Bedford, Blair, Butler, Cambria, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Lawrence, Somerset, Washington and Westmoreland. January 1, 2019 - G.1 and G.2 will no longer be applicable for the following counties: Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia January 1, 2020 - G.1 and G.2 will no longer be applicable for the following counties: Adams, Berks, Carbon, Clinton, Crawford, Cumberland, Dauphin, Erie, Franklin, Fulton, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Luzerne, Lycoming, Mercer, Monroe, Northampton, Perry, Pike, Susquehanna, Venango, Wyoming, York and the counties in the North/Central State Option Zone. If an individual loses CHC coverage and is in a nursing home, G.1 would apply. If an individual loses CHC coverage and is in the Aging Waiver, G -2 would apply. 3. UAdmission to a State Facility U- BH-MCOs are not responsible for BH-MCO Members placed in a state facility. The Recipient will be disenrolled from the BHMCO effective the day before placement in the facility. Medical Assistance eligibility will be determined by the CAO. The Department will recover MCO capitation payments made for any months after the month of placement. Appendix V HC HB Program Standards & Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix V Page 9 4. UAdmission to a Correctional Facility U- A member who becomes an inmate of a penal facility or correctional institution (including work release), or a member who is remanded to a Youth Development Center/Youth Forestry Camp will be disenrolled from the BH-MCO effective the day before placement in the facility.

UPlacement in a Juvenile Detention Center (JDC) U- A member who is placed in a juvenile detention center is disenrolled from the BH-MCO after 35 days and covered through MA Fee-For-Service. During the first 35 days of this JDC placement, the BH-MCO is responsible for all covered services that are provided to the member outside the JDC site; services provided inside the JDC are the responsibility of the FFS program. This includes cases where the CAO enters a facility code placement on a client's record with a retroactive begin date and the BH-MCO record remains opened, the Department will take into consideration the 35 days from the begin date of the placement prior to end-dating BH-MCO coverage. Example: if a client is BH-MCO eligible beginning July 1 and the CAO retroactively enters a facility code \"74\" (store date 11/08) with a placement begin date of August 17; the BH-MCO record will remain open from July 1 through September 20. 6. UHealth Insurance Premium Payment Program (HIPP) U- BH-MCO Members determined by the Department to be HIPP eligible (Employer Group Health Plan) will be disenrolled from the BH-MCO as of the date when the BH-MCO Member Record reflects such disenrollment. Additionally, HIPP eligible MA Members are prevented from enrolling in BH- MCOs. 7. A member enrolled in Living Independence for the Elderly (LIFE), also known as LTCCAP (Long- Term Care Capitated Assistance Program), is disenrolled from the BH-MCO effective the day before the begin date of LIFE. 8.

The BH-MCO will be responsible for medically necessary Behavioral Health Services other than the residential placement. The facility or placing authority can request authorization of services from the BH- MCO which will determine the medical necessity of the placement. The BH-MCO will not be responsible for any services delivered prior to the Appendix V HC HB Program Standards & Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix V Page 11 request for medical necessity determination unless, at the discretion of the placing authority and the BH-MCO, they can agree to begin BH -MCO coverage at the admission date or any mutually agreeable later date. The child is enrolled in a Physical Health Service System (PHSS) serving the zone in which the child is placed. Children placed out of state revert to FFS for physical health and for ancillary behavioral health services other than the placement. Ancillary services could include services such as assessments, psychotherapy, or medication management provided on an outpatient basis. 3. Placement in a C&Y or JPO non- Mental Health Placement If a Child in Substitute Care is placed in a non-mental health or drug and alcohol placement such as: a. Shelter programs b. Diagnostic centers c. Foster family home, including kinship care homes d. Residential facilities The child remains enrolled in the BH-MCO from the original placing county.

The BH-MCO will be required to pay for Out-of-Network medically necessary behavioral health care services for up to ten days for a child enrolled in its plan who is placed in substitute care if the (County C&Y Agency) CCYA cannot identify the child nor verify MA coverage. However, this Out-of-Network coverage will only be required in certain circumstances, such as emergency placement as determined by county child welfare or juvenile probation, or where the CCYA has had no contact with the child prior to the placement. All efforts must be made by the CCYA to identify the child and to determine MA coverage responsibility in the most expedient manner possible. 5. For youth placed in a Juvenile Detention Center, the BH- MCO is responsible for medically necessary State Plan Services delivered in treatment settings outside (off site) the JDC during the first 35 consecutive days of detention.

Fee Year - The year in which a HIPF payment is due from the BH-MCO to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is referred to as the Fee Year. Data Year - The IRS calculates HIPF due in the Fee Year using submitted information on net premiums written for the previous calendar year, which is referred to as the Data Year. A. If a BH- MCO is a covered entity or a member of a controlled group under Section 9010 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that is required to file IRS Form 8963, Report of Health Insurance Provider Information (Report 8963), the BH-MCO must perform the following steps. If a BH-MCO is a Primary Contractor of the Department, the BH-MCO must provide the required materials directly to the Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (OMHSAS). If a BH-MCO is a subcontractor to a Primary Contractor, the BH- MCO must provide the Primary Contractor with the required materials and upon receipt the Primary Contractor must provide the materials to the Department. Submission is not required if the BH-MCO is exempt from the HIPF. 1. By April 30th of each calendar year, the BH-MCO shall provide the Department (directly or via the Primary Contractor) with a copy of the Form 8963 the BH-MCO submitted to the IRS. The BH-MCO shall also provide, for each line on Form 8963 that reports premiums written, the amount of HealthChoices (HC) premium included on that line. For BH-MCOs with multiple HC BH agreements, the BH-MCO shall provide the breakdown of HealthChoices premiums reported on Form 8963 separately for each agreement. 2. The BH-MCO shall provide to the Department (directly or via the Primary Contractor) a copy of the IRS HIPF preliminary fee calculation notice within ten (10) business days of its receipt from the IRS. 3. If a corrected Form 8963 is submitted to the IRS during the error correction period, the BH-MCO shall provide the Department (directly or via the Primary Contractor) with a copy of the corrected Form 8963within ten (10) business days of submission to the IRS. The BH-MCO shall also provide, for each line on a corrected Form 8963 that reports premiums 2 HealthChoices Behavioral Health Agreement - January 1, 202 1 Appendix Y Appendix Y written, the amount of HC BH premiums that are included on that line. 4. The BH-MCO shall provide the Department (directly or via the Primary Contractor) with a copy of the IRS Annual Fee on Health Insurance Providers for 20xx notice for that Fee Year within five (5) business days of receipt from the IRS. 5. If the BH-MCO's net income is subject to federal income tax and the BH- MCO desires the Department to consider this in its calculation of the payment amount, the BH-MCO shall provide to the Department the average federal income tax rate that applies to its income for the Data Year. The BH- MCO shall also provide the amount of taxable income subject to federal income tax and the amount of federal income tax paid for the most recent income tax year for which a tax filing has been made. The BH- MCO shall specify the tax year and shall provide the information by June 30 or by August 30 pursuant to a permitted IRS extension as to such tax filing. 6. If the BH-MCO's net income is subject to Pennsylvania (PA) corporate net income tax and the BH-MCO desires the Department to consider this in its calculation of the payment amount, the BH-MCO shall provide the average state income tax rate that applies to its PA corporate net income for the Data Year. The BH-MCO shall also provide the amount of taxable income subject to PA corporate net income tax and the amount of PA corporate net income tax paid for the most recent income tax year for which a tax filing has been made. The BH-MCO shall specify the tax year and provide the information by June 30 or by August 30 pursuant to a permitted IRS extension as to such tax filing for the Fee Year. B. The Department will: 1. Review each submitted document and notify the Primary Contractor and/or the BH-MCO of any questions. The BH-MCO must respond to questions from the Department within five (5) business days. 2. By September 30 of each Fee Year, the Department will calculate the portion of the Data Year HIPF allowance amounts that covers the HealthChoices portion (specific to this Agreement) of the BH-MCO's HIPF obligation per the IRS HIPF preliminary fee calculation notice (as noted in A.2 above). This calculation will be called the Initial HIPF Payment. To calculate the amount, the Department will: a. Calculate the HIPF obligation rate (the \"HIPF%\") from information on the IRS document \"Annual Fee on Health Insurance Providers for 20xx\", where 20xx is the Fee Year. For a BH-MCO that is a single - person covered entity, the IRS will send this document to the BH- MCO. For a BH-MCO that is a member of controlled group, the IRS will 3 HealthChoices Behavioral Health Agreement - January 1, 202 1 Appendix Y Appendix Y send this document to the designated entity of the controlled group on behalf of all members of the controlled group. Single -person covered entity or controlled group HIPF% = UAmount labeled \"Your share of fee\" Amount labeled \"Sum of total net premiums written as reported\" The amount \"Sum of total net premiums written as reported\" is before the reduction of 100% of the first $25 million of premium and 50% of the next $25 million of premium. The single -person covered entity or controlled group HIPF% is unique to each entity that is subject to the HIPF. The above formula produces the HIPF% to be used in subsequent steps of the calculation in the following circumstances: i. The BH-MCO is a single -person covered entity. ii. The BH-MCO is a member of a controlled group and Unone Uof the controlled group's premiums are reported as \"Premiums eligible for partial exclusion for certain exempt activities\" (listed on Form 8963 as attributable to 501(c)3, (c)4, (c)26, or (c)29 entities). iii. The BH-MCO is a member of a controlled group and Uall Uof the controlled group's premiums are reported as \"Premiums eligible for partial exclusion for certain exempt activities\" (listed on Form 8963 as attributable to 501(c)3, (c)4, (c)26, or (c)29 entities). If the document \"Annual Fee on Health Insurance Providers for 20xx\" has an amount for the \"Premiums eligible for partial exclusion for certain exempt activities\" that is not zero and not equal to the amount \"Sum of total net premiums written as reported\", then information from Form 8963 on the premiums attributable to 501(c)3, (c)4, (c)26, or (c)29 entities will be used to develop a non-profit HIPF% for the 501(c)3, (c)4, (c)26, or (c)29 entities that is 50% of the HIPF% for the other (for-profit) entities, where the application of the two rates to the respective premiums produces the amount \"Your share of fee\". The HIPF% to be used in subsequent steps of the calculations is either the non-profit or for-profit HIPF%, as determined by the status of the BH - MCO. b. Calculate Figure A. Figure A is the total revenue for coverage in the Data Year that the Department or the Primary Contractor has provided the BH- MCO for this Agreement, as known through payments made by August 1 of the Fee Year. The Figure A amount has no provision for the HIPF obligation. c. Calculate Figure B. Figure B is the portion of Figure A that is for services subject to the HIPF. Capitation revenue for services that are 4 HealthChoices Behavioral Health Agreement - January 1, 202 1 Appendix Y Appendix Y excludable under Section 9010, such as long- term care services, will not be included in Figure B. The Figure B amount has no provision for the HIPF obligation. d. Calculate Figure C. Figure C is the calculation of total revenue that incorporates provision for the HIPF and other taxes. The Department will use the following formula to calculate Figure C. If the BH-MCO has not provided satisfactory documentation of federal income tax obligations under section A.5, then the federal income tax rate (FIT%) in the formula will be zero. If the BH-MCO has not provided satisfactory documentation of Pennsylvania corporate net income tax obligations under section A.6, then the state income tax rate (SIT%) in the formula will be zero. However, the BH-MCO and the Primary Contractor shall be notified by the Department in writing of any determination that the submitted documentation is not satisfactory, and the basis for that determination, and the BH- MCO shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of such notification to provide additional documentation to support its federal or state tax obligations under section A.5 and for the calculation under this section B.2.d. U Figure B U 1 (HIPF% / (1 SIT% FIT% x (1 SIT%))) e. Calculate Figure D. the Department will calculate Figure D by subtracting Figure B from Figure C. This is the final HIPF adjustment amount that will serve as the basis for the Department payment to the impacted Primary Contractors. For BH-MCOs with multiple agreements, the HIPF will be allocated across the agreements based on revenue and separate payments will be made. f. The Department will compare Figure D with the sum of the HIPF allowance amounts it has withheld for the Agreement for the Data Year. The lesser of these two figures will be the Initial HIPF calculation. For BH-MCOs with multiple agreements, the HIPF will be allocated across the agreements based on revenue. The Data Year may encompass multiple rating periods. The Primary Contractor and its BH-MCO, if applicable, will review this calculation and notify the Department of any identified discrepancies within ten (10) business days. 5 HealthChoices Behavioral Health Agreement - January 1, 202 1 Appendix Y Appendix Y 3. The Department will utilize the steps provided in B.2. above to calculate a final HIPF payment amount, with these exceptions: a. The Department will utilize the IRS HIPF final fee calculation notice for that Fee Year instead of the preliminary fee calculation. b. Figure A is the total revenue for coverage in the Data Year, as known through payments made by November 1 of the Fee Year. c. The Final HIPF payment amount may not exceed the sum of the HIPF allowance amounts for the Data Year. C. The Department will perform the steps provided by this Appendix for any year that a BH- MCO pays a HIPF, even if the BH-MCO is no longer providing HealthChoices BH services during that Fee Year. D. The BH- MCO shall notify the Department (directly or via the Primary Contractor) if the HIPF actually paid is less than the amount in the IRS final fee calculation notice or if the IRS refunds any portion of the HIPF. If such changes affect the calculations provided in this Appendix, the Department will recalculate its obligation and the BH- MCO will refund the difference. E. The Department will not make a payment per this Appendix if the BH-MCO is not subject to the HIPF. F. The Department will have no obligation to the BH-MCO per this Appendix unless CMS has approved the Agreement that includes this Appendix. 2 Appendix Z HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix Z1.a HealthChoices In Lieu Of and In Addition To Services and Out -of Network Provider Enrollment for Providers, Counties and Behavioral Health Managed Care Organizations 1. The HealthChoices enrollment process for in lieu of and in addition to service providers begins when a Primary Contractor or Behavioral Health Managed Care Organization (BH- MCO) identifies a service need and credentials and contracts with a provider. The following steps are included in this process: A. The Primary Contractor or BH-MCO identifies the need for in lieu of or in addition to service(s) and an appropriate provider (or providers) to deliver the service(s). B. The Primary Contractor or BH-MCO works directly with the Provider(s) to make application for in lieu of and in addition to services or for an out-of-network Provider. C. The Provider(s), with assistance from the Primary Contractor or BH-MCO, completes an enrollment application. The enrollment application includes: HealthChoices In Lieu Of and In Addition To Services Provider Enrollment Application; Provider Agreement for Outpatient Providers; Ownership or Control Interest Form; Document Generated by the Federal IRS listing name and FEIN or SSN; In Lieu Of and In Addition To Service Description (where applicable); BH-MCO Attestation Form; OMHSAS Field Office Attestation Form (where applicable); D. There are two categories of services which require an In Lieu Of and In Addition To Service Description tailored to describe the provider -specific information. They are \"standard\" and \"newly proposed.\" The \"standard\" services which require the submission of an In Lieu Of and In Addition To Service Description with the provider enrollment application include: BSU Diagnostic Assessment Drug and Alcohol Intervention Drug and Alcohol Intensive Case Management Drug and Alcohol Resource Coordination Drug and Alcohol Level of Care Assessment COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES 3 Appendix Z HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix Z1.a A \"newly proposed\" service should fall into one of the 3 categories listed below: Community Treatment Team Community Mental Health Services, Other Drug and Alcohol Services, Other The Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (OMHSAS) will review the service description to determine if it is consistent with the requirements for the service and describes how the provider is proposing to deliver the service. Service descriptions that are incomplete or do not reflect provider -specific information will be returned to the Primary Contractor or BH-MCO. A service description must be completed for each requested in lieu of and in addition to service a Provider is seeking to provide. The Enrollment Form identifies standard (i.e. existing in lieu of and in addition to services). Whether the Primary Contractor or BH-MCO is requesting one of these standard services or a brand new service not included on the form, a Service Description Form must be completed. The Primary Contractor or BH-MCO needs to review the OMHSAS' list of in lieu of and in addition to service descriptions, which have standard descriptions, staff qualifications, expected outcomes, and other information to determine if the particular service being considered is included. If the in lieu of or in addition to service is not on the standard services list, the Primary Contractor or BH-MCO must assist the provider with developing a new in lieu of or in addition to service description. Date of Submission - list the date the Primary Contractor or BH-MCO submitted the service description to OMHSAS for review and approval; Provider's Name - Enter the name of the provider who will be providing this service; Service Name - Enter the name of the proposed service; Primary Contractor or BH-MCO Name - enter the name of the Primary Contractor or BH-MCO who is requesting this new service; Description of Service - complete this section; Coding for Billing and/or Reporting of Services Rendered - complete this section; Anticipated Units of Services per Person - complete this section; Targeted Length of Service - complete this section; Information About Populations to be Served - complete the table indicating the population, age ranges, projected numbers, and characteristics of the population to be served; Program Philosophy, Goals, and Objectives - complete this section; Expected Outcomes - complete this section; Clinical Staffing Patterns - complete this section; 4 Appendix Z HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - January 1, 2021 Appendix Z1.a Cost -Benefit Analysis - complete this section. E. The Primary Contractor or BH-MCO reviews the enrollment application for accuracy and completeness and completes the credentialing of the Provider. F. If the original or modified enrollment application is accepted and is complete, the Appropriate entity signs the Attestation Form and forwards the enrollment application to the OMHSAS Field Office - when applicable. G. OMHSAS Field Office (when applicable) - will review the enrollment application for completeness and for determination of the desire to include the In Lieu Of and In Addition To service provider and submit the new service description for review and approval through the Service System Review Committee (SSRC). After approval is received, the Field Office representative signs the OMHSAS Field Office Attestation Form and secures it to the front of the enrolment application. H. OMHSAS has delegated the approval of OON providers to the Primary Contractor or BH- MCO. It is the BH -MCO's responsibility to enter into a written agreement with an OON provider, and to report person level encounters for the usage of OON providers. Out-of- network providers are not entered into the PROMISe system. The Primary Contractor or BH-MCO should consider bringing frequently- used OON providers into the BH- MCO's network to ensure their inclusion in the BH -MCO's quality management review. Appendix AA 1 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements January 1, 2021 OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS FOR PARTICIPATING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HEALTHCHOICES PROGRAM A. GENERAL REQUIREMENT The HealthChoices Behavioral Health Managed Care Organizations (BH -MCO) must submit to the Department of Human Services (Department) a written description of their policies and procedures for the prior authorization of services. The BH -MCO may require prior authorization for any services which require prior authorization in the Medical Assistance Fee -for-Service (FFS) Program. The BH -MCO must notify the Department of the FFS authorized services they will continue to prior authorize and the basis for their determinations of medical necessity. The BH-MCO must request the Department's approval to require the prior authorization of any services not currently required to be prior authorized under the FFS Program. The BH- MCO cannot require pri or authorization for emergency services or emergency inpatient admissions. Authorization of emergency inpatient services must be consistent with Attachment 1. For each service to be prior authorized, the BH -MCO must submit for the Department's review and approval the written policies and procedures in accordance with the guidelines described below. The policies and procedures must: be approved by the Department in writing prior to implementation; adhere to specifications of the HealthChoices Behavioral Health (HC BH) Agreement, including the Program Standards and Requirements (PSR), applicable policy in Medical Assistance General Regulations, Chapter 1101, and DHS regulations; ensure that behavioral health care is medically necessary and provided in an appropriate, effective, timely, and cost efficient manner; adhere to the applicable requirements of The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) Guidelines for Internal Quality Assurance Programs of Health Mai ntenance Organizations (HMOs), Health Insuring Organizations (HIOs), and Prepaid Health Plans (PHPs), contracting with Medicaid/Quality Assurance Reform Initiative (QARI); include an expedited review process to address those situations when an item or serv ice must be provided on an urgent basis. Future changes in state and federal law, state and federal regulations, and court actions may require review of any previously approved prior authorization proposal. Any deviation from the Department's approved pol icies and procedures, including time frames for decisions, is considered to be a change and requires a new request for approval. Failure of the BH -MCO to comply may result in the Department taking a corrective action. Appendix AA 2 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements January 1, 2021 The Department defines prior authorization as any review of a service or request for a service, which must be conducted as a condition of the service being delivered. The term prior authorization is understood to include but is not limited to: pre-certification; concurrent; predetermination; any other review for the purpose of authorizing services. B.

If the prior authorization is limited to specific populations, the BH -MCO must identify all populations who will be affected by the proposal for prior authorization. 2. Medical Necessity Requirements: a. The BH- MCO must describe the process to validate medical necessity for: covered care and services procedures and level of care medical or therapeutic items b. The BH- MCO must identify the source of the guidelines used to review the request for prior authorization of service s. The guidelines must be consistent with the HC BH PSR definition of medical necessity. c. Medical necessity guidelines used by BH -MCOs must be approved by the Department and conform to Appendix S or T (as applicable) of the HC BH PSR. For BH- MCOs, if th e guidelines being used are: purchased and licensed, the BH -MCO must identify the vendor; developed/recommended/endorsed by a national or state health care provider association or society, the BH -MCO must identify the association or society; based on national best practice guidelines, the BH -MCO must identify the source of those guidelines; based on the medical training, qualifications, and experience of the BH -MCO's Medical Director or other qualified and trained practitioners, the BH -MCO must identify the individuals who will make the medical necessity determinations. d. The BH- MCO must identify the qualifications of staff who will determine medical necessity. Medical necessity determinations must be made by qualified and trained practitioners with ap propriate clinical experience or expertise in treating the Member's condition or disease in accordance with CMS Guidelines, the HC BH PSR, and applicable legal settlements.

Notification, Complaint, Grievance, and Fair Hearing Requirements The BH- MCO must demonstrate how written policies and procedures for requests for prior authorization comply and are integrated with the Member notification requirements and the Complaint, Grievance, and Fair Hearing requirements of the HC BH PSR. 5. Requirements for Care Management/Care Coordination of Non Prior Authorized Service(s)/Items(s) For purposes of tracking/care management/identification of certain diagnoses or conditions, and with advance written approval from the Department, the BH -MCO may choose to establish a process or protocol requiring notification prior to service delivery. If this process does not involve any approvals/denials or delays in receiving the service , the BH -MCO must notify Providers of this notification requirement. This process may not be administratively cumbersome to Providers and Members. These situations need not comply with the other prior authorization requirements contained in this Appendix. C. Prior Authorization Review and Decision Process: 1. Time frames for Notice of Decisions Appendix AA 4 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements January 1, 2021 a. The BH- MCO is required to process each request for Prior Authorization (prospective utilization review) of a service and ensure that the Member is notified of the decision as expeditiously as the Member's health condition requires, at least verbally within two (2) business days of receiving th e request, unless additional information is needed. If no additional information is needed, the BH -MCO must mail written notice of the decision to the Member and the prescribing Provider within two (2) business days after the decision is made. b. If addi tional information is needed to make the decision, the BH -MCO must request the additional information from the Provider within forty -eight (48) hours of receipt of the request and allow up to fourteen (14) Days for the Provider to submit the additional information. c.

The BH -MCO must mail written notice of the d ecision to the Member and the prescribing Provider within two (2) business days after the decision is made. If the additional information is not received within fourteen (14) Days, the decision to approve or deny the service must be made based upon the available information and the Member notified orally within two (2) business days after the additional information was to have been received. The BH -MCO must mail written notice of the decision to the Member and the prescribing Provider within (2) two busine ss days after the decision is made. In all cases, if the Member does not receive written notification of the decision to approve or deny a covered service within twenty -one (21) Days from the date the BH -MCO received the request, the service is automatically approved. To satisfy the twenty -one (21) Day time period, the BH -MCO may mail written notice to the Member and the prescribing Provider on or before the eighteenth (18th) Day from the date the request is received. If the notice is not mailed by the eighteenth (18th) Day after the request is received, then the BH -MCO must hand deliver the notice to the Member, or the request is automatically authorized (i.e., deemed approved). e. If the Member is currently receiving a requested service, the written notice of denial must be mailed to the Member at least ten (10) Days prior to the effective date of the denial of authorization for continued services. If probable Member fraud has been verified, the period of advance notice is shortened to five (5) Days.

If the Member wishes to have servi ces continued as previously approved, the Member must file a Grievance before the effective date of the denial as indicated on the denial notice. f. Advance notice is not required when the BH -MCO has factual information confirming the death of a Member; the B H-MCO receives a clear written statement signed by a Member that s/he no longer wishes to receive services or gives information that requires termination or reduction of services and indicates that s/he understands that termination or reduction must be the result of supplying that information; the Member has been admitted to an institution where s/he is ineligible under the HC BH PSR for further services; the Member's whereabouts are unknown and the post office returns BH -MCO mail directed to the Member ind icating no forwarding address; the Member has been accepted for Medicaid services by another State; or a change in the level of medical care is prescribed by the Member's physician. 2. Denial of Service: A determination made by a BH -MCO in response to a Provider's or Member's request for approval to provide a service of a specific amount, duration and scope which: A. disapproves the request completely, or B. approves provision of the requested service(s), but for a lesser amount, scope or duration than requested, or C. approves provision of the requested service(s), but by a Network Provider, or D. disapproves provision of the requested service(s), but approves provision of an alternative service(s), or E. reduces, suspends, or terminates a previously authorized service. NOTE: A denial of a request for service must be based upon one of the following five reasons, along with an explanation for the reason, which must be explicitly stated on the notice of action: The service requested is not a covered service. The service requested is a covered service but not for this particular Member (due to age, etc.) The provider is not a Network Provider The information provided is insufficient to determine that the service is medically necessary. The service requested is not medically necessary. 3. Authorization Decisions: A behavioral health denial decision based on medical necessity may be made only by a licensed physician or by a licensed psychologist if the requested service is within the psychologist's scope of practice. A licensed psychologist may not determine the medical necessity of requested inpatient services or prescribed medication. For substance abuse Appendix AA 6 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements January 1, 2021 services, a decision based on medical necessity must be made by a licensed physician. Any representative of the BH -MCO who determines the medical necessity of a requested service must, in addition to being appropriately licensed, be appropriately experienced to render such a decision. 4. Denial Notice: When a BH -MCO denies a request for services as defined in Section C.2. of this Appendix a written denial notice must be issued to the Member using the appropriate denial notice template. The BH -MCO must also include the Non-Discrimination Notice and Language Assistance Services templates when it sends the denial notice. The BH - MCO must use the templates supplied b y the Department, which are available in DocuShare. 5. Denial Notice Reporting: The BH- MCO must report denial of services to the Department via the denial log, as detailed in Appendix M. 6. Quality Review of Denial Notices A. The Primary Contractor is responsible for ensuring the content and quality of the denial notices are consistent with the Department's requirements by implementing a formal monitoring process with documented procedures that include (but may not be limited to): criteria used to review denial notices, frequency of reviews, percentage of denial notices to be reviewed, selection process for the denial notices to be reviewed, plan to ensure denial notices for various levels of care are reviewed, plan to communicate review re sults to the BH -MCO, individuals responsible for the review and dissemination of results of the review, and process to ensure the BH -MCO incorporates recommendations from the review. B. The Primary Contractor and BH -MCO are expected to comply with the Depart ment's quality review of denial notices and the Department's efforts to ensure Primary Contractor oversight is adequate. The Department will specify a specific sample of denial notices that will be reviewed as part of the Department's quality review. The Department will review the denial notices to determine if the denial notices are compliant with federal and state regulations, policies, standards, and best practices. Appendix AA 7 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements January 1, 2021 UATTACHMENT 1 UEmergency Inpatient Admission: Prior Authorization, Admission and Documentation 1. Prior authorization of emergency inpatient admissions is not permitted. While prior authorization is not allowed for emergency inpatient admissions , the BH -MCO may conduct a retrospective review , including review of the documentation by the physician at the emergency department verifying the medical necessity for emergency admission Continued stay after stabilization of the emergency may be subject to concurrent review and prior authorization. 2. If a request for continued stay after stabilization cannot be reviewed because it is uncertain if the individual is eligible for Medical Assistance, the BH -MCO must review the request within seven (7) days of the eligibility issue being resolved and no later than 180 days of the date of service. 3.

Included in the CASSP and CSP Principles from their inception, cultural competence has historically focused on the four traditionally underserved populations of African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans. More recently, the Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (OMHSAS) in collaboration with the OMHSAS Cultural Competence Advisory Committee, has taken a broader view of culture. Recognizing the diversity that makes up Pennsylvania's population, Cultural Competence is viewed as inclusive of rural and urban populations, deaf persons, the Amish, groups of recent refugees and clusters of various ethnic populations that are scattered across the Commonwealth, as well as the traditionally identified populations. The Department of Human Services (Department) in its issuance of the Request for Proposals for the HealthChoices Behavioral Health Program recommends the implementation of Cultural Competence Principles by the Primary Contractor, managed care organization (MCO), its subcontractors and any associated provider networks. It is the expectation that the implementation of Cultural Competence Principles will result in a system that understands the implications of racial genetics for medication prescription, the differences in help seeking behaviors among various groups and populations and the basis of internal and external stigma related to mental illness, as well as many other barriers to a successful and effective system of care. PRINCIPLES OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE 1. Principle of the Universality of Ethnicity and Culture. Each person is aging therefore has an age and an age cohort. Each person has: a gender, therefore a gender orientation; abilities, therefore limitations; resources deriving from social constructs, therefore a socioeconomic status; a family history and a legacy that precedes by many generations, therefore an ethnicity and a culture. Identification with others by all these means helps provide a sense of security, belonging and identity. It is this power that drives \"Honk if you own a Volkswagen\", or \"the wave\" at ball parks to work so effectively. Each human encounter in so far as it crosses some boundary of age, belief or practice is, in a sense, a cross- cultural encounter, but we have many bridges to facilitate the crossing. Page 2 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - Primary Contractor - January 1, 202 1 Appendix CC Appendix CC Second Edition Culture is more than just membership in one's racial/ethnic group. Culture is a dominant force arising within us from our parental and community upbringing, serving to shape behavior, values, cognition and social institutions. In the treatment setting, every consumer must be valued within his/her cultural context. Observed differences are to be appreciated as sources of strength and enrichment and resources of reconnection and reintegration. Within each individual's thinking, personal history and family culture lay the defining attributes of his or her problems and the solutions. The wholeness of the individual is important for a complete evaluation and effective intervention. 2. Principle of Cultural Competence. Treatment, recovery and rehabilitation are more effective when consumers and families fully engage in services that are compatible with their cultural values and world -views. Services that are culturally competent are provided by individuals who have the skills to recognize and respect the behavior, ideas, attitudes, values, beliefs, customs, language, rituals, ceremonies and practices characteristic of a particular group of people (Child and Adolescents Services Systems Program Principles). These skills are used to determine consumer wellness/illness, establish individualized and consumer -driven plans and goals, and to create unique services that are community -based and that integrate natural supports. Cultural competence entails knowledge of consumers' literacy level, native languages, levels of acculturation and assimilation, and cultural health care beliefs, customs and practices. This body of knowledge guides the service system to increase consumer access to services, and to better design, implement and evaluate services tailored to particular cultural groups. The principle entails vigorous integration of cultural competency principles and standards of practice throughout all levels of behavioral health and substance abuse planning, policy- making, research, evaluation, training and service delivery. 3. Principle of Social and Environmental Influences. Social conditions of poverty, unemployment, discrimination, class rank, immigration status, and isolation greatly impact all aspects of behavioral health care and contribute deleterious effects and exacerbate symptomatology. Effective service outcomes and quality of life are achieved when the consequences of these social experiences are identified and incorporated into health care planning and service delivery. Services are designed and funded to assure these conditions are not barriers to health care. The service system assures that services do not merely reach the most motivated, educated and socially mobile consumer and family. Service evaluations entail assessing the prevalence of these social conditions in communities, and engaging consumers at the highest risk of illness. Planning processes recognize social conditions and their impact on health and interventions. Professionals avoid assigning fixed diagnoses and characteristics to consumers who are merely responding to stressful social conditions. Service systems adopt no-reject/no -eject standards of practice so that no consumer is rejected or ejected from services because of Page 3 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - Primary Contractor - January 1, 202 1 Appendix CC Appendix CC Second Edition behavior that is necessary to survive and cope in their social conditions. 4. Principle of Consumer -Driven Services. Consumer -driven services include activities that individualize plans, assessments and services that focus on the priorities, values and goals of consumers and families. Whenever possible, self-help services are created and utilized. Consumer -driven services foster self-determination and choice. Cultural groups are fully engaged when they are actively involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of services that fit their unique worldview. For many cultural groups this entails services that heal the wounds of bias and discrimination. It entails the establishment of linguistically appropriate services, assuring the availability of culturally competent advocates, and educating consumers on the workings of the service system. Consumers, and their families and communities, fully participate in determining the kind of services that best achieve goals for achieving high quality and meaningful lives. Systems of care must have a goal of empowering consumers, during the course of treatment, to be self- determining in all domains of their lives. 5. Principle of a System of Care. Systems of care are consumer -driven, highly coordinated service responses to multiple needs of consumers and families. They require professional willingness to engage, interact and communicate in effective partnerships with culturally diverse populations, and to encourage and value consumers' active role in the service planning process. In a system of care services focus on all domains of consumers' lives (mental health, education, medical, housing, social rehabilitation, employment) and integrate health care needs into a single coordinated plan of services that is individualized and culturally relevant. Services are community -based, involve natural supports, strength - based, and are least restrictive. Cultural and non-traditional ways of healing are integrated in case management and treatment/rehabilitation plans. All planning processes are consumer - driven and family -focused. Family and community members are engaged and invited into the planning and service delivery processes. This entails planning meetings that are community -based and are convenient to consumer availability. These strength - based, comprehensive plans are designed to enhance consumers achieving high quality and meaningful lives. 6. Principle of Access. Access occurs when cultural groups perceive that services are relevant to their life experience and world-view, and use them. Linguistic, geographic and cultural barriers to services are identified and removed. Service systems use culturally relevant media to inform and educate cultural groups, and the general public, about services and supports. Full access to services is determined by evaluating both the use of services by cultural groups as compared to the general population, and by evaluating the prevalence of concerns and problems in specific cultural communities. Increasing access results in less use of crisis and emergency services. Problems and concerns are identified early, and prevention and support services reduce the severity and prevalence of chronic illnesses. This principle entails identifying and overcoming transportation, poverty and community safety barriers to services. Whenever possible, services are community -based. Page 4 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - Primary Contractor - January 1, 202 1 Appendix CC Appendix CC Second Edition 7. Principle of Quality of Life Outcomes. Consumers and families evaluate outcomes of services, and the service system, by their ability to enhance and improve quality of life. Quality of life is achieved when consumers reach and accomplish self- defined meaningful life goals. It involves having meaningful social roles within family and community. It involves consumer empowerment and self -determination to make decisions in all domains of their life. Case management and treatment/rehabilitation plans encompass all domains of consumers' lives to foster growth and development of necessary personal, social, employment and interpersonal skills to achieve fulfillment and wellbeing. Holistic approaches to health care are essential to assure consumers have a high quality of life. 8. Principle of Managed and Integrated Health Care. Costs of public health care are best managed and contained by providing high quality, effective mental health and substance abuse services tailored to consumers and family culture that integrate and coordinate medical, mental health and substance abuse. In this way, consumer engagement may be maximized, and use of more costly emergency services reduced. Primary health care that engages consumers in preventative health care throughout life development reduces costs and improves the overall health of our communities. Integrating physical and emotional health in assessments, plans and services is essential. The service system emphasizes managing care, and not dollars, by assuring consumers are in least-restrictive treatment settings, and gain access to services early. Prevention is a key goal for managed and integrated systems of care. Prevention includes community education about mental illness, substance abuse, family support services, early identification programs and services, and social marketing campaigns to de-stigmatize mental illness. Prevention and early intervention necessitate behavioral health providers to link with physical health care providers and other community -based services. Assuring a high quality of life for consumers is considered an important aspect of prevention. Subsequently, increasing community employment and job skill training are examples of prevention activities. 9. Principle of Data/Evaluated Driven Systems of Care. Traditional ways of collecting information, and planning and evaluating services, do not reach isolated and high- risk populations. Many existing information systems and planning processes do not attain information about communities, and only focus on those currently and traditionally served. Assuring services are culturally competent requires engaging communities to gather information about the prevalence of problems, stressful social conditions, substance abuse and mental illness. Data and findings are always interpreted in the context of each cultural community, and not merely compared to the general population as a normative standard. Individual, family and community outcomes are projected as an aspect of county planning processes. Storytelling, testimonials, and oral accounts of needs and satisfaction are considered data sources. In consumer -driven systems of care, feedback by consumers regarding service satisfaction and outcome are most important data for future planning and system re-design. Page 5 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - Primary Contractor - January 1, 202 1 Appendix CC Appendix CC Second Edition Outcomes and effectiveness of services are evaluated based on the prevalence of illness and problems in the cultural community, and not merely by comparing rates to the general population. This principle assures professionals and community members avoid using the dominant culture as a normative standard of health. Rates of illness are impacted by cultural, social and historic differences among social groups. Behavior that seems aberrant to the general population may be healthy responses to social conditions. Services target the unique patterns of illness and problems in cultural communities, and develop unique community -based health standards by which to evaluate services. 10. Principle of Least Restrictive/Least Intrusive Services. Services occur in settings that are the most appropriate and natural for the consumer and family, and are the least restrictive and intrusive in impacting the right of self-determination by consumers, families and communities. (CASSP) This means community -based, in-home and natural support services being first utilized, unless there are assessed indications that other services are necessary to assure outcomes and quality of life. Justification for more restrictive and intrusive services occurs at all levels of planning: initial assessment through discharge. Consumer, family and community members are included in determining the least restrictive/intrusive setting and service. As minorities are over-represented in restrictive settings, and as recipients of behavioral controlling treatments, service systems regularly collect data and monitor these services. Plans of action are created and implemented when evaluation finds cultural groups are over-represented in restrictive treatments. Page 6 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - Primary Contractor - January 1, 202 1 Appendix CC Appendix CC Second Edition GUIDELINES FOR THE APPLICATION OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE PRINCIPLES ACCESS AND SERVICES AUTHORIZATION Families and natural supports persons (self-defined family) have access to services in a respectful and welcoming manner. Services are provided in timely, convenient and easily accessible ways. Protocols exist to assure services are available to persons who are disinclined to accept treatment. Bilingual and bicultural providers, and trained interpreters, are available throughout the entire service system. Service availability and determination encompass a holistic rehabilitative approach that includes psychiatric, medical, social, vocational, behavioral, cultural, spiritual, familial and community supports. Indicators of Guideline Application 1. Persons of diverse cultures and linguistic differences are served based on their preference and actual need. 2. Service systems utilize a variety of formats to disseminate culturally relevant information regarding mental health and addiction services, as well as non- traditional and self-help resources. 3. A written plan guides action that engages and encourages individuals in need of services but who are disinclined to accept treatment. 4. Service systems demonstrate timeliness in member access and authorization of services. 5. Service systems adopt flexible service hours to maximize the availability of services. 6. Service systems authorize cultural- based alternative and complementary treatment approaches that assure consumer engagement, retention and follow -up. 7. Service systems staff and Managed Care Organizations have culturally and linguistically competent staff available 24 hours a day, and 7 days a week. 8. Service agencies have a milieu and physical environment that reflects diversity and the surface cultures of consumers being served. MEASURES OF GUIDELINE APPLICATION 1. Service utilization rates of traditionally under -served and over-represented persons are comparable to the prevalence of illness and problems that occur in the ethnic/cultural group. Cultural/ethnic community residents use behavioral healthcare providers as a community resource for all health concerns. In highly Page 7 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - Primary Contractor - January 1, 202 1 Appendix CC Appendix CC Second Edition 2. restrictive services, utilization rates are comparable to all other groups in the general population. 3. Service providers have a list available in each facility of culturally and linguistically accessible services. 4. Descriptions of culturally sensitive services and programs are available for consumers in their community and other natural gathering places. Providers develop ethnically/culturally relevant ways of disseminating information that make services widely known in ethnic/cultural communities. 5. Educational and information materials reflect the languages and cultures of persons served. 6. Service systems track the utilization rates of persons who are traditionally disinclined to accept treatment. These systems develop studies on the prevalence of illness and problems in ethnic/cultural communities, and identify the barriers they experience to seeking help. Service systems create correction plans, implements actions, and measure improvements in help- seeking behavior. Indicators of positive impact include: decrease use of emergency rooms, decrease use of crisis services, increase number and use of advocacy groups, decrease arrest rates of persistently ill consumers, increase referral follow -through rates, and increase voluntary use of self- help and prevention services. 7. Service systems track the increase in availability of services. Availability is indicated by services occurring in settings that various ethnic/cultural groups define as comfo rtable, appropr iate, consistent with their values and worldvie w, and complementary to their natural healing practices. 8. Service systems track the number and type of alternative and complimentary treatment approaches for various cultural groups. High performance is indicated by an integration of traditional healing practices and treatment approaches with professional models that capture the best of each. 9. Service systems determine consumer satisfaction and increase access because of flexible hours, and alternative and complimentary treatment. 10. Waiting area and offices display magazines, art, music, etc., reflective of the cultures and ethnic groups of consumers being served. Page 8 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - Primary Contractor - January 1, 202 1 Appendix CC Appendix CC Second Edition CASE MANAGEMENT Case management shall be central to the operation of the multidisciplinary team. It reflects an understanding and appreciation of the values, norms and beliefs of consumers' cultures, and knowledge of resources in their communities. Case management recognizes the unique mental health/substance abuse issues associated with the consumer's economic conditions, social class, and experience of bias, discrimination and racism. Case management recognizes the impact of these issues on behavioral health and takes these into account in considering the cultural appropriateness of all services that are coordinated and managed. Case management advocates for the consumer, assures consumers are knowledgeable of service options, and assists consumers in making best choices. These activities are individualized to the diverse culture, race, ethnicity and language differences. Case management services participate in ongoing assessments of their service system to determine and assure that they are responsive to diverse consumer needs and experiences. INDICATORS OF GUIDELINE APPLICATION 1. Consumers have access to a comprehensive array of services that are compatible with their culture. 2. Consumers receive culturally competent services that are coordinated within multiple domains, i.e., vocational, social, educational and residential settings. 3. Culturally competent services are continually created and adapted to meet the needs of consumers. MEASURES OF GUIDELINE APPLICATION 1. Service utilization data and information are utilized to increase enrollment of under - served populations. Ethnic cultural group enrollment in less restrictive services (outpatient, self-help, social rehabilitation) increases to levels comparable to the general population. Enrollment in restrictive services (inpatient, involuntary commitments, jail treatment settings, court -ordered outpatient) decreases to levels comparable to the general population. 2. Service systems document culturally competent services and resources received by consumers. Individual and family definitions of culture, ethnicity and need guide the development of indicators for high levels of performance. Merely providing culturally competent services to person of color, or persons who are perceived different than Page 9 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - Primary Contractor - January 1, 202 1 Appendix CC Appendix CC Second Edition mainstream culture, is not an indicator of compliance. 3. Service systems document family and community contacts/visits, and visit locations. High levels of compliance are system -wide supports for family and community member advocacy and full participation in all aspects of case planning. Parent led support/advocacy groups naturally develop and influence decision- making throughout the delivery system. Merely having record of family member attendance at meetings is not an indicator of compliance. 4. Service systems document that consumers have improved relationships within family, and within social networks of their cultural group. High levels of compliance are indicated by fewer consumers estranged from their natural family, and high levels of family involvement in planning processes and support services. 5. Service systems document that consumers achieve the greatest degree of independence and self-determination. The use of restrictive services by ethnic/cultural groups is reviewed annually for use in comparison to the general population. Each provider implements a plan of correction until usage levels are comparable. Restrictive care includes the use of psychotropic treatment without complementary clinical/rehabilitative services. 6. Revised care plans and services demonstrate inclusion of ethnic, social and cultural factors. 7. Cultural competence training for all case managers is incorporated in reviews for regulation compliance. Training is designed for the ethnic/cultural groups that exist in the service community. Levels of training and competence are established. 8. Community resources and natural supports are included in all care plans. Page 10 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - Primary Contractor - January 1, 202 1 Appendix CC Appendix CC Second Edition TREATMENT/REHABILITATION PLAN All persons served receive a treatment/rehabilitation plan that is holistic, and incorporates the consumer's choice of attainable goals, culturally compatible treatment modalities, and consumer driven alternative strategies of health care. These strategies include the use of family, community supports, spiritual leaders and folk healers. Plans are consumer driven, based on their individual strengths, and developed within the context of family and social networks so as to create a consumer -professional partnership. Plans are formulated and reviewed by culturally competent professionals and culturally competent consultants in full collaboration with consumers and families. INDICATORS OF GUIDELINE APPLICATION 1. Identification and creation of culturally relevant goals. 2. Use of culturally compatible modalities and alternative strategies. 3. Consumers and families fully participate and share in the development of goals and wishes, and express satisfaction with their role and participation. MEASURES OF GUIDELINE APPLICATION 1. Plans document consumer wishes and goals. These may be related to employment, education, training, personal appearance, health, family relationships, social activities and social relationships. Plans specify ethnically/culturally relevant wishes and goals. 2. Service systems document consumer and family satisfaction with their participation in the treatment/rehabilitation planning process. Low levels of satisfaction trigger plans of correction, implementation of these plans, and re-evaluation. 3. Plans outline cultural relevant treatment and rehabilitation modalities and strategies. 4. Service systems document that professionals are trained in the development of culturally competent treatment and rehabilitation plans. Training, staff skills, and cultural competence will be greatly impacted by the kinds of ethnic/cultural groups in the service area. A high level of performance is indicated by professional standards for competence for each ethnic/cultural group, and not a generalized declaration of professional competence due to completion of a generalized cultural competence training program. 5. Service systems create all written planning materials and documents in plain and simple text that is readily comprehended by consumers and families. Page 11 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - Primary Contractor - January 1, 202 1 Appendix CC Appendix CC Second Edition RECOVERY AND SELF -HELP Recovery and self-help groups are readily available, and function as an integral part of a seamless continuum of care. Recovery and self-help groups are culturally diverse and culturally compatible, incorporating consumer -driven goals and objectives that are oriented toward rehabilitation and recovery outcomes. Culturally competent providers and consumers in recovery are enlisted as consultants and educators to assist in the creative development of alternative treatment services, models and supports that are compatible with the lifestyles, values and beliefs of various cultures. INDICATORS OF GUIDELINE APPLICATION 1. Services are accessible and available in a variety of settings, including churches, neighborhood facilities, and consumer residences. 2. Service system creates more integrated, culturally and linguistically specific, recovery groups. 3. Services are readily accessible and available in a variety of settings. 4. Community groups, consumers in recovery and other natural supports groups are recruited in the development and design of recovery and self-help service models. MEASURES OF GUIDELINE APPLICATION 1 Service systems document the increase use of recovery and self-help programs by consumers of various cultural groups. As families and communities are engaged in services, the number of ethnic/cultural self-help, advocacy and recovery groups increase. A high- level of self-determination which is emphasized while maintaining inclusion in the service system is a strong performance indicator. 2 Service systems document an increase in the variety of ethnically/culturally relevant recovery and self-help programs. The array of ethnic/cultural services increases as the service system better engages and empowers families and communities. 3. Providers make available to consumers a list of recovery and self-help services in locations that are readily accessible to consumers and their communities. Page 12 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - Primary Contractor - January 1, 202 1 Appendix CC Appendix CC Second Edition CULTURAL ASSESSMENT A cultural assessment is conducted by competent staff for each consumer, and within the context of the consumer's culture, family and community. The assessment is individualized, multidimensional and strength -focused. The components of the assessment include functional, psychiatric, social status, cultural milieu, social and economic stresses, discrimination, and family supports. INDICATORS OF GUIDELINE APPLICATION 1. A cultural assessment is the basis for a culturally relevant diagnosis, goals and rehabilitation/treatment plans. 2. A cultural assessment tool and guide exists to determine cultural factors that impact treatment/rehabilitation services. 3. On-going cultural assessment occurs at each phase of treatment and rehabilitation. 4. Cultural assessment includes consumer preferences, and differentiates pathology from cultural factors. MEASURES OF GUIDELINE APPLICATION 1. Bilingual staff is available to assess consumers in their language of preference. 2. Qualified cultural interpreters are utilized when bilingual staff is not available. 3. Psychological assessment and measurement tools are culturally valid and reliable, and administered, scored and interpreted by culturally competent providers. 4. All consumers receive an ethnic/cultural assessment. The rates of chronic, anti- social and other serious diagnoses for all ethnic/cultural groups are comparable to the general population. The use of restrictive treatments for all ethnic/cultural groups is comparable to the general population. 5. Providers document the inclusion of family members and significant community support persons in the initial and on-going assessment process. An indicator of high level performance is community- based, including community/family/consumer driven assessments and service planning. Page 13 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - Primary Contractor - January 1, 202 1 Appendix CC Appendix CC Second Edition 6. The assessment includes cultural factors that are important to the treatment process. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: a) Preferred language. b) History of indigenous/immigration/migration/generation behavior patterns. c) Degree of acculturation and adaptation. d) Cultural, social, economic and discrimination stresses and traumas. e) Learning and cognitive styles. f) Family organization and relational roles. g) Extent of family support. h) Social network composition. i) Ethnic identity j) consumer's perception/belief of presenting problems and explanations for symptoms. k) Consumer's belief systems regarding mental illness/substance abuse. l) Sexual identity and sex role orientation in cultural group. m) Coping strategies utilized within the cultural group. n) Help -seeking behavior. o) Previous attempts at relieving, managing and treating symptoms. (Including healers, traditional medicine, etc.) To protect the rights and confidentiality of consumers, family and friends are not to be used as language/communication interpreters. These persons are welcomed to participate in the treatment planning process. Page 14 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - Primary Contractor - January 1, 202 1 Appendix CC Appendix CC Second Edition COMMUNICATION STYLE AND LINGUISTIC SUPPORT Consumers, families and other support persons receive cross- cultural and communication - support, such as assistive devices and qualified language interpreters and professionals' interpreters. These supports are available at each entry point to services and continue throughout the consumer's treatment and rehabilitation services. Staff is knowledgeable in the use of professional interpreters, and telephone interpreters are only utilized in emergencies. Orally presented information, and written materials and documents, are translated in the consumer's preferred language. Examples include consumer rights information, orientation packets, consent forms and treatment plans. INDICATORS OF GUIDELINE APPLICATION 1. Consumers and family members receive cross- cultural communication supports at each point of entry in the service system. 2. Consumers and family members report their level of satisfaction with communication supports. 3. Staff is knowledgeable in the use of communication supports. 4. Interpreters are qualified, competent, and demonstrate knowledge of consumers ' cultural experience; including deaf, hard of hearing, and deaf blind 5. Communication supports demonstrate culturally accurate assessments, treatment/rehabilitation plans and service delivery. 6. Cross -cultural communication supports are available and comparable across all consumer cultural groups. MEASURES OF GUIDELI NE APPLICATI ON 1. Service systems increase the number of bicultural and bilingual staff, competent in the communication styles of the diverse cultures of consumers, as to minimize the use of interpreters. 2. A resource list of trained and qualified interpreters, updated annually, is maintained by facilities. Consumers and families are aware of the availability of interpreters through service advertisement efforts. Page 15 HC BH Program Standards and Requirements - Primary Contractor - January 1, 202 1 Appendix CC Appendix CC Second Edition 3.
