Lincoln Chiropractic is Northern Rhode Island's premiere office of Chiropractic for families that want to stay healthy and live life more abundantly. EFFECTIVE Over the last 15 years, we've worked with thousands of families across RI and MA who truly appreciate the work that we do. AFFORDABLE We avoid the high costs and paperwork associated with health insurance companies and pass the savings directly onto you. CONVENIENT Our office is open throughout the week and conveniently located off Routes 146 and 295 in Lincoln. We're available when you need us! Hello! I'm Dr. Herb Curtis, Jr. Chiropractic is the removal of vertebral subluxations so that the body can express Life the way it was designed. A subluxation is a misaligned vertebrae that puts pressure or stress on the nervous system. This can cause pain but always keeps the body from functioning the way it was intended. Locating and correcting subluxations allows the body to express Life more abundantly! What about KIDS? When we see a child in our office, we typically check the spine and adjust if necessary to prevent a problem. When we adjust an adult, we are correcting a problem and trying to maintain it. There is a big difference. We would rather check and prevent in our office rather than waiting until we have to correct and maintain. It was super easy to get started because they don't take/require insurance. I started coming to Lincoln chiropractic about 2 months ago. I was having issues with IBS and every doctor I saw just told me it wasn't a big deal and basically just to deal with it. Since starting with Dr. Herb I have had NO issues with IBS. I can't emphasize enough how this has helped get my digestive system back on track and help me feel healthier. Maxwell. D via Google Not only do I go to see Herb, my wife, son and my sons girlfriend also see him regularly. I have been going to Dr. Herb Curtis for over a year. I work in a warehouse and am constantly lifting heavy cases, usually with hip and back pain. That was until I started to see Herb. Now I go once a week for my \"ten minute correction\". No pain at all. He offers great hours and family plans too. He always treats us like we are apart of his family. Bruce. C via Google My family goes every week, even my 3 year old and 6 month old get adjusted. Dr Herb doesn't just crack your back. He explains why you should see a chiropractor, what the long term benefits are and advises you to come consistently. And he makes it easy with his great monthly plan. My family goes every week, even my 3 year old and 6 month old get adjusted. Jake. B via Google This place is heaven to me. This place is heaven to me.

About Dr. Curtis, our Chiropractor Well qualified for RI chiropractic After graduating from Siena College in 1998, Dr. Herb Curtis Jr. attended the University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic where he received his Doctorate of Chiropractic degree in 2002 and a Masters in Human Nutrition in 2003. He established Lincoln Chiropractic in 2007. Serving the local community Over the years, Dr. Herb has been happy to share his knowledge through lectures and workshops for the local community. He's had the pleasure of speaking at organizations such as the YMCA, Women and Infants, CCRI, Bank of America, General Cable, US Naval Base, Northern Rhode Island Chamber of Commerce as well as area churches and libraries. Family means everything Originally from upstate New York, Dr. Curtis and his wife Chantelle chose to settle in RI because it's the midway point between his family in NY and her family in Maine. Family has always played a big part in their lives and they love being centrally located. Living a healthy lifestyle As a kid, Dr. Curtis spent time sailing on the Hudson River and Long Island Sound, so he loves being able to do the same now as an adult living in Rhode Island. In addition to sailing, the couple enjoy an outdoor lifestyle that includes activities such as skiing, fishing and snowshowing. They also have a true passion for healthy eating, personal fitness and live music. Lincoln Chiropractic 132 Old River Road Suite 105 Lincoln, Closed All days are by appointment only.
