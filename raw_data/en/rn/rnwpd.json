They were very professional and after we personally went to their healing center and paid them, they went the next day to the hotel that we were staying at to \"clean us\" and after it for the next 48 hrs it wasn't recommendable for us to drink alcohol, eat spices or eat red meat and pork. At this time, i honestly wasn't fully sure what it was going to happen and i was very nervous and anxious, in the other hand my husband was very excited. The day arrived and since we signed up for the private ceremony they picked us up at our hotel and took us to villa alegre, we started with the coca leaf reading which it was incredible, the shaman happened to know our concerns and health problems. After it, we proceed to the ayahuasca ceremony with a different shaman. My first hallucinations were very scary and i was in constant pain, i even thought unconsciously to leave the room, however after about half an hour of fear, my visions became more clear and i wasnt scare anymore, i felt very calm and relax, and i got most of my questions answered by the shaman in my hallucination. I even saw my relatives in it, i got to talked to some of family members that has passed away, while in a ceremony for my husband to heal him from his fears, all of it in my hallucination. It has changed my life and my husband completely but in a good way, our marriage is stronger now, and now i feel more confident of myself. In 2010, myself, my partner and some friends joined a sacred tour led by Solara An Ra which was overseen and organised by Angel of Etnikas. I had one of the most memorable trips of my life. It was simply amazing. Everything was so well organised and we were very well looked after by Angel who took into consideration the desires of the group for a sacred and spiritual trip and created a trip accordingly. Even adjusting it as we went along. Initially I was very disappointed that we could not go to Machu Picchu, because heavy rains had washed the rail track away. But this disappointment was soon turned into joy, because it was suggested we went to Lake Titicaca instead. This was simply my favourite part of the trip. We sailed across the amazing blue waters of the lake to visit families that live on the floating reed islands of Uros. We were able to go onto the Islands and visit the families who showed us their way of life. We then sailed onto the Island of Amentani, where we were all matched up with a Homestay family, with whom we spent the next two days. We stayed in a mudbrick house with no running water or electricity. Food was cooked on a clay oven from homegrown vegetables and herbs. We were made to feel very welcome, it was truly an amazing experience. The island was beautiful, steeped in legend, as is the Lake, and the people genuine, friendly and joyful. This island and its people made a lasting impact on me. Throughout the trip we were joined by Shaman, who blessed us with their sacred ceremonies. Showing us their ways of connecting with the land and with spirit and joining with us in our sacred gatherings also. I could go on, for there is so much to say, so many places we visited and things we did. I will end my comments by saying wow! What a fantastic trip, great fun and so well organised. It was so great to have a local company organise the trip, who know the lands and people so well. Great for anyone wanting an ethical holiday as well, as local people, local hotels etc were used throughout. I found it astonishing to read through review after review about a center that so consistently changed so many people's lives. How could this be possible in as little as a couple of days? How could the experiences be so consistently out of this world? I had to find out for myself and I went on to have years worth of spiritual, personal and philosophical insights in two days. Etnikas provides such a supportive, professional, thorough, safe, heart-filled, sincere environment. I felt like I was with family and was being nurtured in a cradle by an entire team whose sole purpose for two days was giving me the experience of a lifetime. Plus, I was helped throughout by my amazing assistant Elias who was personally at my side night and day. An experience with Etnikas isn't for everyone but if you are considering it, I think review after review of life changing experiences speak for themselves. After struggling with Ayahuasca for three years, I was at the end of the rope, you could say. I had been put on medication when I was 15 and over the course of three years they added so much medication, I couldn't recognize myself any more. I had developed a permanent tremor from the over-stimulation of the cocktail of medication they had me on. I heard about the healing medicine Ayahuasca and looked into Etnika's and for once I felt a renewed sense of hope. Thanks to the unending support of my parents, we were able to plan and go on a trip to Cusco. My father travelled with me and we did the 2 day/1 night retreat. Everyone at Etnika's was friendly and I felt a deep connection to them because they all knew why we travelled all this way and they understood and only wanted to help. Everyone's experience is different and in a way it is purely ineffable. I can describe my experience to you all day, every week, for the whole entire year and I STILL will not do my experience justice. By even putting it into words, I am taking a small piece away from my out-of-this-world experience. But I will make it simple by saying this: I am healed. The lessons I learned from my experience are things that I will carry with me through the rest of my life. I will never forget my trip to Cusco and my retreat with Etnika's. I owe them my life. And for those of you who are still unsure about Etnika's or Cusco, Peru: Look into your heart and find the answer. Help will always come to those who ask for it. I guarantee it will not be an easy fix. My journey through Ayahuasca was single handedly the hardest thing I have ever done but also the only thing that could have saved my life and if I had to do it all over again, I would do so in a heartbeat. Thanks so reading my review and I hope this helps. The experience is different for each person, the beauty of the Medicine is her wisdom of know exactly what you need to know, but the experience is 90% you and 10% Ayahuasca, if you are not concentrated or your heart is not open, the Medicine can\u00b4t do anything for you. The way is not a religion o the Ayahuasca, the way of heart is your own Love. Like Don Juan said \"every way gets you to the same place, to nowhere, the important part is to walk with your heart\". That's the important part; that\u00b4s is what Etnikas try to do. My experience was unique, I\u00b4d never imagine that I was going to experiment that. It was my second time with her, with the Medicine. My first time was in Mexico in my own city, that experience was one of the most powerful and transcendental experiences in my life. At that time I was living a very beautiful and important period in my life, it was like my whole existence, especially my last six years, take me to that moment. The Medicine taught me a lot of things, but the most important part that I want to share is that she asked me if I want to died, and I said yes. So I died, and I experienced what I call THAT, some people call It God and is ok, but in that moment I knew that THAT is the most important in the existence. The Medicine taught me that I have to look for THAT, my whole life has to be pointing to THAT. I\u00b4m in Love with THAT. But is not such a thing like same experiences with the Medicine. Each experience is different, and my adventure with Etnikas was very different. First of all, I want to say that I have nothing else to ask form Etnikas. The chamans were fantastic, they are real Masters of the Medicine, they have a lot of experience so I felt very secure with them. The same thing with the assistance and the whole team, in the store and in the retreat house. The experience depend almost all on you, no one is going to live the experience for you, you have to achieve the correct concentration, humility, honesty and love, but is a very good help that the chaman, the place and the assistance make your comfortable. I work in interreligious dialogue, I\u00b4ve known and worked with a lot of chamans, lamas, priests and others religious and spiritual people, so I know for experience that not for working or reading spirituality you are a good person. They are a lot of fake chamans pretending to be spiritual, but they only wants to make money, even some times they are criminals that rape or kidnap people during the ceremonies; they are also a lot of people that use the Medicine as a drug, separate of the religious context, that is very dangerous and lost all the transcendental meaning. I\u00b4m very happy that Etnikas is against to this kind of wrong use of the Medicine, they are a very serious Institute which work with a very serious chamans and people. I felt very secure, in a very nice context and place, with very nice and prepare people, they know what they were doing. This experience with the Medicine was very different than the other one, but was the same message. The first one was the most beautiful experience in my life, the second one was the most horrible and terrifying experience in my life, but not because it was a bad experience. The visions I had were about horrible thinks, like dead people, drug addicts and narcotraficants killing people, etc. The Medicine show me the horror of the world, the evil itself. She taught me that the way are not the sacred plant, not the religion, the only thing that really matters is God, the God of Life, the Life itself. The message was the same than the first time, I have to search God, and all my life has to be pointing in that. The Medicine punished me, I thought that I wouldn't make it; I felt my bones were broken, I just wanted to kill myself, it was horrible. But now I know what I need to know, the Medicine helped me to see better. A initiation ceremony in shamanisms has to be with dead, the initiate have to died so he can reborn as a new person. That was what happened to me, I died and know I\u00b4m a total new person. Now I know what I have to look for in life, the God of love. Thank Etnkas for everything, and thanks Medicine. Thanks God. I visited Etnika's two months ago, so I have had some time to reflect on the experience, and think about how it has changed me. I did the 5 day visit for $1,400, which although expensive, is almost irrelevant, considering the massive turning point it marked in my life. I must stress that all the people at Etnika's are incredibly dedicated people. Even if you doubt in their methods, I think you will still be able to feel their passion and purpose to help society by transforming consciousness through this medicine. I must stress that this is not something to take lightly! Not only because of the high cost, and the possibly frightening experience while on ayahuasca, but also because of the purification process leading up to taking the medicine. I fasted for the better part of a day and a half, and drank 17 cups of volcanic mineral water, vomiting and diarrhea after nearly every glass, until my diarrhea was \"clear of particulates\". I also abstained from drugs (all drugs, illegal and legal) and meat and fish, and other chemically processed foods for a week prior, though next time I plan to go longer. You can cut corners, but know that it will decrease the quality of your ayahuasca experience. Mental and spiritual preparation is also very important. Yoga and meditation will help you be calm and ready for the ceremony. Again, this is not a recreational drug!! I refer to Ayahuasca as a medicine, and not a drug, because of the connotation associated with the two words. Ayahuasca is a medicine which heals you spiritually, and more in tune with the harmony of the universe. If you take it lightly, it is more likely that you will not have a good experience. If you go with the total expectation that it will change your life, I can assure you, it will. Etnika's is great in that Joanna and the shaman will help you through the painful parts of the experience. I wasn't too sure of the profundity at the time, of the ceremonies to mother earth, and pachacammac, but if you just go with it, letting go of expectations of what you think it you should be, this also will be an important part of your ayahuasca ritual. The setting is also great, though not in the jungle, it's in a serene cabin in the \"Sacred Valley\" near Cuzco, where you can have pleasant walks in between ceremonies. The food is very good, though not what you're likely used to. it's all-natural and grown locally, no processed foods or GMO's here. My main issue was that since my Spanish-speaking is rather limited, I was completely reliant on Joanna to translate between the shaman and me. It's hard enough as it is to convey understanding speaking between two people, but with an intermediary, a lot is lost, unfortunately. I see this as my own fault, and next time, I plan to learn Spanish before I go. While I'm tempted to write about my visions, this review is surely long enough as it is. I will refer you to Terrance McKenna, his writings on ayahuasca are wonderful. So to wrap it up, while Etnika's will provide you a great experience, it is geared more towards tourists and people who are new to Ayahuasca, while I will recommend it whole-heartedly to those who are very curious and eager, I will be going to a shamanic village in Amazonia for my next Ayahuasca experience.
