Andrew Wakefield made a rare public appearance in Chicago on Sunday during which he claimed the country faced an imminent crisis because vaccinations have created a mutant strain of the virus. \"There are two elements to this problem,\" he told an audience at an autism conference. \"One is that the measles vaccine is itself causing measles and the second is that the measles vaccine is not producing immunity that protects either against natural measles or the vaccine-induced measles.\" Mr Wakefield co-authored a 1998 paper suggesting a possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Ten of the report's co-authors have since retracted the paper's assertions after an investigation found that it relied on bogus data although Mr Wakefield repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and declined to retract the paper's findings. The inquiry uncovered financial and ethical conflicts of interest which led to him being struck off the British medical register in 2010. He later relocated to America, where he has continued to promote his views and become something of a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among anti-vaccine groups in the country. Mr Wakefield and his anti-vaccine theories are having a resurgence at a time when America is facing its worst measles crisis in 25 years, with the country recording 940 cases of the highly contagious disease so far this year. The former doctor was linked to a major outbreak of measles among a Somali community in Minnesota in 2017 after he visited and shared his views with them. Health officials said Mr Wakefield and other vaccine sceptics who visited the community bore some responsibility for its vaccination rate dropping from 92 per cent to around 40 per cent, leading to almost 80 measles cases. More recently Mr Wakefield made headlines when it emerged he was dating Elle Macpherson, the Australian supermodel, who attended the conference with him on Sunday. Last week it was reported that he had spoken to New York's Orthodox Jewish community, which has been at the centre of this year's measles epidemic, appearing via video link at a \"vaccine symposium\" in Rockland County which drew hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews. This newspaper can also reveal Mr Wakefield is currently fundraising for a follow up to his controversial 2016 film \"Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe\" - which was removed from streaming sites such as Amazon Prime Video earlier this year after an outcry from US lawmakers. The second documentary, entitled \"Vaxxed II: The People's Truth\", is still seeking crowdfunding but is due to be released later this year. The Telegraph has previously spoken to those involved in the second production, who said the film would feature interviews with \"whistleblowers\", including \"proper white coat doctors\" and parents who had voiced concerns about vaccines. \"It's really just a catalogue of events since vaxxed came out and a warning to parents to do their research and know that vaccine injuries are real,\" said Polly Tommey, the British producer behind the first film. Ms Tommey, who is a business partner of Mr Wakefield, said the human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) would be a main focus of their new documentary. Brian Burrowes, another associate and producer, said: \"Parents are told that these things are perfectly safe but there's another side... so we just want people to be informed and do their own research\". Mr Wakefield was actively promoting Vaxxed II during his on stage appearance on Sunday. Asked by an audience member what America could do to protect itself against the resurgence of measles, he replied: \"Help me make a film.\" During his 45-minute talk at the Autism One Conference, Mr Wakefield claimed America's intelligence agency was influencing government health policy on vaccinations for use as a \"political weapon\". \"Documents recently released at the end of the Obama administration [reveal] that vaccines were perceived by the Central Intelligence Agency as a wonderful currency for negotiating with developing countries,\" he said. \"So this became a political weapon - America also wanted to remain at the forefront of bio terrorism warfare and bio-warfare and so the CIA were heavily involved in influencing American vaccination policy back in the 60s and up until today. Therefore there could be no bad news about vaccines as part of America's currency for dealing with the rest of the world.\" He also claimed the pharmaceutical industry had financial motivations for promoting vaccines, saying the injections were \"a remarkable commercial success in terms of volumes of sales precisely because it doesn't work\". Mr Wakefield's recent comments come as the US faces its worst measles crisis in 25 years - despite the disease being declared eradicated in 2000. One of the most serious outbreaks has been in New York City, where 535 cases have reported since last September, but Mr Wakefield claimed all of the cases \"had prior evidence of measles immunity\", adding \"the person who caused this had multiple vaccines\". In fact, the US health protection agency has stated the cases occurred primarily among people who had not received vaccines. A string of studies in the last nine years have found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism, including a decade-long study by researchers at Copenhagen's Statens Serum Institut which followed more than half a million Danish children born from 1999 to 2010. But federal and state health officials have warned the spread of misinformation by anti-vaccine groups on social media has heavily contributed to a spike in measles cases.
