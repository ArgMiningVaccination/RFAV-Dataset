MIS-C usually presents 2-4 weeks after COVID-19 infection or exposure, and rare reports have been documented in neonates. Vaccinations for COVID-19 have been approved for children aged 6 months and above in the United States, and recent reports suggest significantly low prevalence and risk of complications of Multi-organ Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) in vaccinated children compared to unvaccinated children. Vaccinations for COVID-19 are safe and recommended during pregnancy and prevent severe maternal morbidity and adverse birth outcomes. Evidence from other vaccine-preventable diseases suggests that through passive transplacental antibody transfer, maternal vaccinations are protective against infections in infants during the first 6 months of life. Various studies have demonstrated that maternal COVID-19 vaccination is associated with the presence of anti-spike protein antibodies in infants, persisting even at 6 months of age. Further, completion of a 2-dose primary mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalization among infants aged 6 months or less. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that maternal COVID-19 vaccination can reduce the risk of and severity of MIS-C in infants. In this article, we review the literature to support this hypothesis.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-09-02", "cleaned_text": "Maternal COVID-19 Vaccine May Reduce the Risk of MIS-C in Infants: A Narrative Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10091454](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10091454) this pandemic, an increasing incidence of Kawasaki-like disease has been seen in otherwise healthy children which is now termed multiorgan inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). MIS-C is a rare but serious consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection which occurs 2-5 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure [ [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01454)]. Most of the cases are reported in children aged 8 to 12 years but young children and even neonates are not spared this severe multi-organ inflammatory disease [ [4](#B4-vaccines-10-01454)]. Cardiac complications are reported in 50% of the cases and due to the complicated course, most children who develop MIS-C require care in the intensive care unit (ICU) [ [5](#B5-vaccines-10-01454), [6](#B6-vaccines-10-01454)]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started tracking MIS-C cases in May 2020 and since then, 8210 cases of MIS-C and 66 deaths due to MIS-C have been identified [ [7](#B7-vaccines-10-01454)]. [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01454)]. However, there is no formal definition of MIS-N, and this term is used by some clinicians for case identification in neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01454), [9](#B9-vaccines-10-01454)]. Both vertical and horizontal transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the proposed etiology for MIS-C in infants [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01454)]. [10](#B10-vaccines-10-01454)]. There is growing evidence that MIS-C incidence is lower in vaccinated adolescents [ [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01454), [12](#B12-vaccines-10-01454), [13](#B13-vaccines-10-01454)]. Further, hospitalization rates are lower in vaccinated children, and infants 0-6 months of age born to vaccinated mothers [ [14](#B14-vaccines-10-01454)]. COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for pregnant females, and have been proven to be safe and effective in preventing COVID-19 incidence and its complications in pregnant mothers [ [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01454)]. Transfer of IgG antibodies to infants after maternal vaccination has been well-documented for other vaccines, and these antibodies can persist in the infant beyond the neonatal period, providing protective effects in the infant [ [16](#B16-vaccines-10-01454)]. It can therefore be hypothesized that maternal vaccination for COVID-19 can lead to transplacental transfer of IgG antibodies to the infant, and render protection against not only COVID-19 but also its complications, such as MIS-C in infants. In this article, we aimed to review the available literature that evaluated: (1) transplacental transfer of antibodies to the newborn and during early infancy after maternal COVID-19 vaccination, and (2) the risk of COVID-related hospitalization and MIS-C incidence in vaccinated children and infants born to mothers vaccinated during pregnancy. 2. Materials and Methods 3. Results 3.1. Studies Evaluating Transplacental Transfer of Antibodies to Newborns and Young Infants after Maternal COVID-19 Vaccination [Table 1](#vaccines-10-01454-t001)). Most of these case reports/case series and prospective cohort studies are reported from the United States and Israel. After a detailed review, all the studies demonstrated that anti-spike protein (anti-S) IgG antibodies were detected in the umbilical cord samples of neonates at birth after maternal vaccination. Trostel et al (2021) studied that these antibodies were positive in all the neonates at birth [ [17](#B17-vaccines-10-01454)]. Interestingly, the fetal titers could reach the maternal level just after 15 days of the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, but neonates born to vaccinated parturients had higher antibody titers and prolonged protection compared to those born to infected parturients [ [18](#B18-vaccines-10-01454), [19](#B19-vaccines-10-01454), [20](#B20-vaccines-10-01454), [21](#B21-vaccines-10-01454)]. Vaccination in the third trimester and a booster dose in this trimester were also found to be associated with high maternal anti-spike IgG levels [ [22](#B22-vaccines-10-01454)]. Six of the studies tested the neutralizing properties of transplacentally transferred maternal antibodies and revealed that the neutralizing capacity of neonatal sera was comparable to maternal sera, which could protect infants from SARS-CoV-2 infection and its [ [21](#B21-vaccines-10-01454), [27](#B27-vaccines-10-01454)]. Vaccinated parturients had high titers at birth, with respective high levels in cord blood samples. Furthermore, these antibodies were positive in 98% of infants at 2 months of age and declined to 57% at 6 months of age, but compared to infants born to parturients with SARS infection in pregnancy, only 8% of these infants had positive titers at 6 months of age. Mangat et al. (2021) also reported case reports in which antibodies were persistently positive at 6 months of age, but the titers were declining [ [28](#B28-vaccines-10-01454)]. |Author & [| (2 doses) - (a) - Vaccinated parturients (n = 86); - (b) - PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected during pregnancy (n = 65) - (c) - Unvaccinated non-infected parturients (n = 62) - (1) - Vaccination elicited strong maternal humoral IgG response - (2) - Maternal titers in the fetus attained within 15 days following the first dose.

Studies Evaluating the Risk of COVID-19-Related Hospitalization and MIS-C Incidence in Vaccinated Children and Infants Born to Mothers Vaccinated during Pregnancy [36](#B36-vaccines-10-01454)]. Comparison of the data during Delta and Omicron predominance showed that COVID-19 vaccination decreased the hospitalization rate during the Omicron surge from 93 to 79% in the 12-18 age group, whereas vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization among children 5 to 11 years of age was 68%, for which the data is available only during the Omicron surge [ [37](#B37-vaccines-10-01454)]. From April 2021 to January 2022, VE against hospitalization in the 5-to-11-year age group was 78% but VE was reduced in older children when the 2nd dose of vaccine was given >150 days from infection [ [38](#B38-vaccines-10-01454)]. Furthermore, completion of 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy showed VE of 61% against hospitalization in infants 0-6 months of age [ [14](#B14-vaccines-10-01454)]. On the other hand, an increased hospitalization rate was noted in children 1-4 years of age during the Omicron surge, as the vaccination was not available for this age group during that time [ [39](#B39-vaccines-10-01454)]. [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01454)]. Studies from France reported similar findings, in which decreased MIS-C likelihood was noted after the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (From 1 September 2021 to 31 October 2021) [ [12](#B12-vaccines-10-01454)]. Oduldali et al. (2022) reported that the risk of MIS-C in children 12-17 years of age in France was significantly lower after vaccination (1.5 per 1,000,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine) as compared to the risk of MIS-C due to infection by SARS-CoV-2 (113 per 1,000,000 infected by SARS-CoV-2) [ [13](#B13-vaccines-10-01454)]. [40](#B40-vaccines-10-01454)]. Vaccination has been found to be safe and effective and is being administered under the most intensive vaccine safety surveillance effort in history. Based on benefit-risk assessment, it's estimated that approximately 1000 COVID-19 hospitalizations may have been prevented during the Omicron surge among fully vaccinated children ages 5-11 years, in the United States [ [41](#B41-vaccines-10-01454)] ( [Table 2](#vaccines-10-01454-t002)). 4. Discussion [44](#B44-vaccines-10-01454)] Most cases of MIS-C are clustered in the 8-11-year age group and the number of cases in neonates and infants reported thus far has been low [ [7](#B7-vaccines-10-01454)] In a systematic meta-analysis, DeRose et al. (2022) analyzed 48 studies, which include 29 case reports, 6 case series and 13 cohort studies [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01454)]. They identified 25 papers, which included a total of 32 cases of MIS-C in the form of case studies in infants aged 0-6 months. Additionally, 31 infants 0-6 months of age with MIS-C were identified in 12 existing cohort studies, which included a total of 1062 children 0-18 years old. The youngest case of MIS-C reported was in a 7-day-old infant [ [45](#B45-vaccines-10-01454)]. MIS-N is the definition proposed by some clinicians for infants born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but there is no formal definition of MIS-N. Based on this proposed definition, Del Rose et al. (2022) identified 33 neonates with MIS-N and interestingly, only 18.2% had fever as compared to fever as a major criterion in the diagnosis of MIS-C in children [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01454)]. The true incidence of MIS-C is not known. Based on a multicenter study of a large cohort in the United States, the cumulative incidence of MIS-C in those younger than 21 years of age was 2.1 per 100,000 persons, with a mortality rate of 1.4% [ [4](#B4-vaccines-10-01454)]. Incidence in newborns and infants is unknown due to scarcity of data and difficulty in diagnosis as newborns could be afebrile, and due to many overlapping symptoms, it can be difficult to differentiate MIS-C from sepsis in early infancy [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01454)]. Although there are only a few cases reported so far, risk of cardiac complications and critical illness is high in this population, with very a high mortality of 12.5% reported in infants 0-6 months of age [ [4](#B4-vaccines-10-01454), [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01454)]. [46](#B46-vaccines-10-01454)]. Viral load at the time of MIS-C diagnosis is lower, and it has been hypothesized to be an autoimmune and hyperinflammatory response to the initial infection. High levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interferon alpha and gamma, and interleukin (IL) -1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-17, are reported but no pathognomonic marker has yet been identified [ [47](#B47-vaccines-10-01454), [48](#B48-vaccines-10-01454)]. Decreased expression of angiotensin convertase enzyme (ACE) receptors in early infancy and predominantly stronger innate immune response with less adaptive immune development are the proposed reasons behind the decreased incidence of severe COVID-19 infection and eventually, the development of MIS-C in infants. [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01454)]. Similar studies from France also revealed a lower incidence of MISC-C in vaccinated children [ [12](#B12-vaccines-10-01454), [13](#B13-vaccines-10-01454)]. [14](#B14-vaccines-10-01454), [28](#B28-vaccines-10-01454)]. It is unknown if the risk of COVID-19 and its complications increases corresponding to the decline in titers of these antibodies after 6 months or not. The risk of MIS-C in infants born to vaccinated mothers has not been extensively evaluated. Maternal vaccination leads to anti-spike protein IgG antibody production in maternal circulation, which then gets passively transferred to the fetus through transplacental transport and is detected in newborns after birth and early infancy and has a neutralizing effect against COVID-19 infection and its complications, Conclusions Author Contributions Funding Institutional Review Board Statement Informed Consent Statement Data Availability Statement Conflicts of Interest References - Assessment of 135 794 Pediatric Patients Tested for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Across the United States.
