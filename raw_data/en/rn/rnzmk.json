While 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day (e.g. 56g per day for a 154-pound person) is adequate for most adults, that number nearly doubles (1.2 to 1.6g per kg, or 84-112g for the same person) to build muscle mass and properly recover as an athlete. Let's be clear: The more nutrients you can consume from whole foods, the better. But supplementing with high-quality protein powder can help you reach those higher daily protein goals, easier. However, there are still a lot of protein powders using artificial sweeteners and other questionable ingredients. Others, meanwhile, aren't going through safety testing or disclosing results \u2014 some are [adulterated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6571825/) (aka cut with cheaper fillers to [reduce manufacturing cost](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/press-releases/raleigh-business-owner-charged-defrauding-protein-powder-consumers), and not actually all protein). While there's no set definition of what qualifies as a \"natural\" protein powder, [the three sports nutritionists I interviewed for this piece](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/fitness/best-natural-protein-powder#our-experts-9) generally agree a natural protein powder is different in that it doesn't have artificial ingredients, fillers, or irritants, goes through minimal processing, and was farmed and manufactured with a low environmental impact. At the end of this guide, I go into more detail about [what exactly defines a natural protein powder](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/fitness/best-natural-protein-powder#faqs-8) and [what you should look for in a quality supplement](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/fitness/best-natural-protein-powder#what-to-look-for-in-a-natural-protein-powder-7). Otherwise, read on for the healthiest, best-tasting natural protein powders.

Best plant-based: Vega Sport Plant-Based Protein Powder - [See at Vega Sport](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_030419_best-natural-protein-powders-20&h=01636dc224fbdb8836e8bc2620071f3b0e083246cf6829180aca00944a6746ef&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f4221d&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Ffitness%2Fbest-natural-protein-powder&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmyvega.com%2Fproducts%2Fvega-sport-protein-1&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) Vega Sport Plant-Based Protein Powder is the best tasting, most effective plant-based powder you can find, with a wide array of flavors and whopping 30 grams of protein. Best casein: Naked Micellar Casein Protein Powder - [See at Amazon](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_030419_best-natural-protein-powders-20&h=10279f7bb494fd8750e0fb5ae209ee46fe3a91b147953d14c9b69e0b91887d3d&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f4221d&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Ffitness%2Fbest-natural-protein-powder&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNaked-Casein-Micellar-Preservative-Stimulate%2Fdp%2FB00NBILDQ8&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) Clean and simple, Naked Micellar Casein Protein Powder is best for before-bed shakes and a holdover before fasting periods. Best customizable: Gainful Protein Powder - [See at Gainful](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_030419_best-natural-protein-powders-20&h=9c5e043be2b5ea73a5853b33c332678b5d025bd219acaf752d32eb187b0d7879&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f4221d&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Ffitness%2Fbest-natural-protein-powder&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gainful.com%2Fshopping%2Fpersonalized-protein-powder&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) Gainful is a completely personalized protein blend to meet your specific goals while adhering to your dietary restrictions, and offers access to a registered dietitian. Pros: Flavorless (versatile in different shakes and recipes), only one ingredient, excellent ingredient sourcing Cons: Dairy allergy/aversion prohibitive, only sold in large quantity When it comes to a protein powder to help you build muscle mass, whey takes the top spot for those who aren't lactose intolerant. That's because it has a much higher amount of leucine, a branched-chain amino acid shown to help [Pam Bede](https://instagram.com/pambederd), RD, CSSD, sports dietetics specialist and author of \" [Sweat.Eat.Repeat](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_030419_best-natural-protein-powders-20&h=fb984ef4ab5281e318770cd3f85945445ff274e67191b8b1c75f3bac99f63471&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f4221d&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Ffitness%2Fbest-natural-protein-powder&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSweat-Eat-Repeat-Playbook-Improve%2Fdp%2F1948007002&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false)\". Plant protein has its own benefits, but when it specifically comes to building muscle, whey is best for the job. While there are a lot of great whey powders on the market (we particularly love Garden of Life's whey \u2014 see more in [what else we recommend below](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/fitness/best-natural-protein-powder#what-else-we-considered-6)), Insider Reviews fitness editor Rick Stella, alongside thousands of reviewers, loves Naked Whey Protein above all others for one main reason: In addition to not tasting chalky or artificial when added to a shake, the powder only has one ingredient \u2014 high-quality whey protein. And 30 grams per scoop at that. Even though the natural additives you'll find in other brands' products (like stevia or erythritol) aren't necessarily unhealthy, they may cause digestive distress for some. We love that Naked Whey is a formula that will not only agree with most people, but fully support their health goals (so long as they aren't allergic or intolerant to whey). What's more, the brand practices conscious ingredient sourcing; they partner with small California dairy farms, whose cows are grass-fed year-round without hormones to then produce whey. And at just over a dollar an ounce, it's competitively priced. The main downside is if you're lactose intolerant or vegan, whey isn't an option for you \u2014 in which case, we highly recommend [our top plant-based protein pick](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/fitness/best-natural-protein-powder#best-plant-based-vega-sport-plant-based-protein-powder-3). Pros: Excellent sustainability, certified and approved by stringent testing boards, in the most effective form of protein Cons: Dairy allergy prohibitive, some people don't like stevia, erythritol can be a digestive irritant for some Garden of Life has been a favorite among plant-based protein brands for years, so it was a big deal when they decided to get into whey protein. The brand continued its impeccable standards and its whey has become one of its most-loved products. Garden of Life Organic Whey also happens to be Bede's go-to brand for the best whey protein powder. It's the only Non-GMO Project-verified whey on the market, according to the brand, and is certified organic. The cows at the small New Jersey farms are pasture-raised and grass-fed 300 days of the year (the other 65 days, they're supplemented with certified-organic feed), and overall the farms \"have much smaller carbon footprints than conventional farms\" the brand says. Plus, it tastes good. Pros: Super high protein content (especially for plant-based), certified and approved by stringent testing boards, great taste Cons: Some people don't like stevia Vega Sport Protein Powder is one of the most affordable, best tasting, highest quality natural protein powders available \u2014 and it's plant-based. What's more, one scoop offers 30 grams of the macro which is a rare high for a plant-based powder and great for vegans or lactose intolerant folks trying to build muscle. While whey is ideal for supporting gym efforts, Bede says she reaches for plant-based protein to boost her overall daily protein count outside of muscle-building needs, adding that \"research suggests diets rich in plant protein are more supportive of health and wellness.\" ( [Find out more about plant-based vs. whey protein in our FAQs](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/fitness/best-natural-protein-powder#faqs-8)). Vega uses four sources for the protein (pea, pumpkin seed, sunflower seed, and alfalfa) for an array of essential amino acids, and is fortified with ingredients like [tart cherry, which may aid in recovery](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33440334/). Vega stands out most, though, for the taste: Not only does the brand offer a wider-than-most selection of flavors (three for the plant-based, five for [premium plant-based](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_030419_best-natural-protein-powders-20&h=27406664a3685404576c8221310fa11a66acf2fcbb73baabdc7ab5340e5ec223&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f4221d&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Ffitness%2Fbest-natural-protein-powder&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmyvega.com%2Fcollections%2Fsport-protein-powders%2Fproducts%2Fvega-sport-premium-protein%3Fvariant%3D34289877680259&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false)), but the taste is really smooth for all. Note that it does contain stevia. Pros: Purity (only one ingredient, sourced from US farms), with zero additives Cons: Dairy allergy prohibitive, unclear certifications/sustainability, only sold in large quantity Naked makes the list again, for the same reasons its whey variety took the top spot: the quality formula. Its casein protein powder is [cold-processed](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_030419_best-natural-protein-powders-20&h=e771823d62c23f4771103bbf66b2c20e1627ab8f8a899debfacad09e9e741906&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f4221d&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Ffitness%2Fbest-natural-protein-powder&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnakednutrition.com%2Fblogs%2Fprotein%2Fcold-processed-whey-protein%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DSometimes%2520called%2520%25E2%2580%259Ccold%2520pressed%252C%25E2%2580%259D%2Cbeen%2520exposed%2520to%2520high%2520temperatures.%26text%3DThis%2520heat%2520separates%2520the%2520liquid%2Cportions%2520to%2520be%2520used%2520individually.&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false), meaning it's never exposed to high temperatures, which the brand says enhances the bioavailability of the protein. It's also created with acid-free and bleach-free processing, maintaining a high standard of manufacturing to ensure a safe product. The unflavored option uses zero sugars or sweeteners and has only one ingredient: micellar casein sourced from American farms. Casein is a slow-digesting protein, which makes it a great pick for pre-bed protein, which studies have shown can help [facilitate athletic recovery](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32698256/) and [prevent late-night hunger](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.2001.280.2.E340). It may also help stave off hunger for fasting periods for religious reasons or [intermittent fasting](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/intermittent-fasting-benefits). Pros: Designed based on your goals, allergies, and preferences; meets your exact dietary needs; carbon-neutral; access to RD Cons: Requires subscription, more expensive, some people don't like stevia If you have a hard time finding a protein powder that doesn't mess with your gut, that has the right kind and amount of protein for you, and that tastes good with your go-to smoothie, consider trying a personalized powder for roughly the same price as other options. Gainful creates a formula for you based on a 5-minute quiz assessing factors like dietary restrictions; frequency, type, and timing of exercise; age; gender; and weight goals. From there, Gainful creates a blend with different types and percentage breakdowns of protein and a unique recommended serving size specific to your needs. The company doesn't use any artificial flavorings, sweeteners, colorings, binders, fillers, thickening agents, or preservatives in its formulas. All formulas come unsweetened unless you choose a \"flavor boost,\" which would then be sweetened with organic stevia and monk fruit. (You get to choose two flavors with each delivery \u2014 I really liked the chocolate peanut butter.) I also really love that ordering Gainful includes access to a registered dietitian, who is then available for a 1:1 consultation whenever you need to advise on how often and when to consume your protein, provide guidance on weight management, and share tips on the best foods to incorporate into the rest of your diet to help meet health goals. Gainful also told Insider it's currently in the process of publishing third-party lab results so consumers will have access to information on product safety, verification that products are free of heavy metals, etc. In the meantime, it requires its manufacturers to provide COAs for each ingredient, as well as its own QA testing documentation, and use non-GMO, organic ingredients for everything other than the whey and casein. [Raw Organic Whey](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_030419_best-natural-protein-powders-20&h=443794b0f4d66fde4713e4b4ee6072bb2edd4704cbf273ce9b1f18de86345874&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f4221d&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Ffitness%2Fbest-natural-protein-powder&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRaw-Grass-Fed-Whey-Undenatured%2Fdp%2FB018UPBFUK&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false): This of organic whey (21g) from grass-fed cows in Iowa. This one is top quality but was edged out by our top overall pick. Its third-party verification is unclear, but [all lab results are public](https://www.raworganicwhey.com/pages/raw-organic-whey-3rd-party-lab-test-results). [Tone It Up Protein](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_030419_best-natural-protein-powders-20&h=9cdb0b02c9426989a7281d41e8c9a77373f137e115561e43122be6efe301a7d8&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f4221d&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Ffitness%2Fbest-natural-protein-powder&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D35871X943606%26xs%3D1%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmy.toneitup.com%252Fproducts%252Fplant-based-organic-protein-powder-28-servings&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false): Tone It Up's organic vegan protein powder is plant-based, allergen-free, has no artificial flavors or sweeteners (though does have gum additives for texture), and is certified organic, low-calorie, and non-GMO. It's actually quite tasty and versatile (it works for a number of recipes and different uses), and widely available (Target, Amazon). However, it only offers 15 grams of protein per scoop, which is a little too low for our parameters [Aloha Organic Chocolate and Vanilla Protein Powder](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_030419_best-natural-protein-powders-20&h=e37e793bb27e3c38712eff45a77973e40c7a18f28417528eb1d5ec0208d02de0&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f4221d&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Ffitness%2Fbest-natural-protein-powder&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FALOHA-Organic-Protein-Servings-PACKAGING%2Fdp%2FB00ZY7UR8O&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false): Aloha is a high-quality formula that offers 18 grams of plant-based protein. It's also one of the only options under $35, and can be found at Target and Walmart. However, the taste is quite polarizing. Some of Insider's editors love the way Aloha tastes, while others, including myself and Bede, don't love the sweetened, coconut-ey palate, so take that as you will. MyProtein Impact Whey Isolate: We love the 22 grams of whey offered here, but this formula contains sucralose and Acesulfame K, artificial sweeteners, and artificial flavorings \u2014 so it's not \"all natural.\" Huel Complete Protein: We tested and liked the flavor here and that it's vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, contains all 27 essential vitamins and minerals, and is super affordable at price per ounce. However, the brand also uses sucralose, an artificial sweetener, so doesn't make the cut for \"all natural.\" So now for the metrics \u2014 how to evaluate 'natural' protein powders, based on your needs, preferences, and tips from the pros. The best protein powder for building muscle mass is the same regardless of if it's a natural formula: whey. Plant-based protein is definitely valuable and has its own benefits. But [research has shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723444/) that plant-based proteins have \"lower anabolic potential\" than dairy (i.e., you may not build muscle as easily with plant protein). This may be [due to low leucine content](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26224750/), as Bede mentioned earlier, an amino acid crucial to stimulating muscle repair. Besides egg white, you have two main animal proteins to choose from in powder: Casein, which makes up 80% of milk protein, and whey, which covers the other 20%. A 2020 study in [Nutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7760812/) found that whey significantly promoted muscle protein synthesis (MPS) better after exercise than soy or casein \u2014 a fact pretty much all experts are in agreement over. But while whey is better for building muscle mass, casein has a slower absorption rate, which makes it a good pre-bed protein [for both recovery](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32698256/) and [preventing late-night hunger](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.2001.280.2.E340). Casein can also be used before fasting periods if you need to stay full for a long period of time. \"I grab casein for a slow-digesting protein that keeps the amino acid pool stocked for up to six hours,\" Bede adds. As for plant-based proteins, that same study in [Nutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7760812/) showed soy beat casein for stimulating MPS. However, not everyone can tolerate soy and [there is some debate over whether the processed form used in protein powders is the healthiest option for women](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/is-soy-bad-for-you). (Whole forms of soy, like tofu and edamame, [aren't problematic](https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/how-your-diet-may-affect-your-risk-of-breast-cancer.html), our medical reviewer Samantha Cassety, RD, points out.) Most experts agree a combination of different types (e.g. pea, brown rice, pumpkin seed, etc.) also works well to make sure you're getting all the essential amino acids to stimulate MPS. But the [Nutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7760812/) study authors note that you might need to just ingest larger quantities of plant proteins (40 g/day or higher) to reach similar muscle growth that you'd get from whey protein [at under 30g/day]. No, natural protein powder is not unhealthy. If anything, a truly sustainable, low-processed, additive-free protein powder is helpful. However, Garcia points out that \"natural\" can be a marketing ploy since there's no set definition, so you have to be diligent to make sure that you're buying is actually of quality. There can also be pitfalls to what seems to be a healthier choice, explains Andrews. \"Most people equate 'natural' with something that comes straight from the earth without any manipulations,\" he says. \"While this might sound good in theory, there are many problems with this kind of thinking, as Mother Nature doesn't always have our back (e.g., poison hemlock, poison mushrooms) and humans can benefit from certain types of processing and manipulations (e.g., shelled walnuts, hulled millet, protein powder).\" The three experts we interviewed all gave different answers on what qualifies as a natural protein powder.
