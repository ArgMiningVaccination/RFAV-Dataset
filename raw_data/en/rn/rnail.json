Often, we don't acknowledge our health until it is compromised. And only then do we seek ways to regain it. Acupuncture can help you along the path toward optimal health and vitality, physically, emotionally and spiritually. These are the stages of treatment that can lead you toward a balanced, healthy and holistic lifestyle: 1. Relief Treatment Most patients begin acupuncture treatment to receive quick relief from pain, discomfort and other symptoms. This is Relief Treatment. This type of treatment allows you to feel better faster. Each visit builds on previous visits, paving the way toward eliminating your initial problems and complaints. Frequent visits over the next few weeks or months may be needed to further reduce your symptoms. Your condition, age, lifestyle and the quality and quantity of your energy, called Qi (pronounced \"chee\"), are all factors in your treatment frequency. After relief treatment, you will notice that your aches or pains have been dramatically reduced or eliminated. 2. Corrective Treatment This next phase is Corrective Treatment. Signs and symptoms have been reduced, and visits are less frequent. This phase maintains and supports the changes you have achieved and provides a foundation for deeper healing. This is also the time when underlying problems can be addressed. Even though you may not be experiencing symptoms, it is important to continue to strengthen, build and support your body. Stopping treatment now could disrupt the progress you have already achieved, and even simple activities could cause a relapse. 3. Maintenance & Wellness Treatment Maintenance & Wellness Treatment is the next stage. This type of treatment preserves all the progress you have made. Visits may be monthly, every other month or seasonal. Much the same way you keep a car running smoothly with regular oil changes and tune-ups, periodic visits to your acupuncturist can keep you running smoothly. These preventative maintenance tune-ups further strengthen your body's resistance, keeping you healthy, balanced and potentially free from illness. Little problems may be caught before they become major concerns. Wellness treatment is the root of healing. In ancient times, an acupuncturist was only compensated as long as patients remained healthy. If they became ill, it was the doctor's duty to get them well again without compensation. An acupuncture lifestyle, combined with regular exercise, a healthy diet and other good habits, can keep you looking, feeling and performing at your best. Treatments may be combined with homeopathy, cupping, moxibustion, meditation, massage, or exercise. These techniques are added to further relieve symptoms, speed recovery time and pave the way toward health, vitality and longevity. It is difficult to judge the health and integrity of your body's Qi simply by whether you are experiencing pain or other symptoms. Qi imbalances can exist in the body for years without showing any symptoms. For this reason, regular acupuncture evaluations and treatments are necessary. Just as periodic checkups can help detect tooth decay before it becomes painful and leads to serious problems, regular acupuncture checkups can help identify, rebalance, and correct little problems before they become bigger ones. Acupuncture is recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be effective in the treatment of a wide variety of medical problems.
