The past never had been altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.\" and so if we would keep our society, then we must keep our history and defend it from alteration. the reason for this is simple: \"Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.\" i have always found the plot device of \"going back in time to prevent some dystopian future\" to be somewhat fanciful not just because of the physics but because \"who would need to?\" you can simply change the past right now and claim it was ever so. many see this trend in \"other\" kinds of history from pretexts of war to social movements to what happened on january 6th or when the germans bombed pearl harbor. but we somehow presume science to be above such adulteration. progress in science is deemed cumulative, not cyclical; governed by reason method and not by emotion and exigency. but it's not. this is because the treacherous taint of the political subsumes all that it touches rendering even the soundest of systems corrupt and hyphenate. the simple law of politics is this: politics + X = political X eg. \"politics + science = political science\" always is it so. experiment gives way to focus group. replication cedes prominence to repetition as does isolation of variables to ideological purity. there are no exceptions and the lysenkoist lunacy is now such that 100 years of evidence based pandemic guidelines were, without so much as a \"by your leave\" despotically defenestrated in favor of evidence free joy rides with the lives and livelihoods of the world. the nonsense \"studies\" to support it were ginned up after the fact. lockdowns have always been a way to flatten the curve. masks have always been protective against respiratory viruses. but think back. was this a part of any pre-2020 history you lived? and nowhere were these oceaniaesque instant on inversions more prevalent than vaccines. the vaccines cannot be trusted. the vaccines have always been safe and effective. we always needed long term studies and cannot place faith the federal government. FDA panels are a waste of time and we must have federal mandates. the vaccines will stop the spread and create herd immunity. the vaccines were never supposed to stop spread and these transpositions must not be embedded into our collective consciousness unnoted for if they are we lose our history and thereby our future. such would place our lives at the whim of the fabulists seeing self aggrandizement and dominion. and you do NOT want to live there. memory itself is to be suppressed and distrusted by the good citizens of the owrellian regime. \"In order to control the collective memory of its constituents, the Party forbids its members to keep written records of their lives, and mandates that any photographs or documents be destroyed through \"memory holes\" placed throughout Oceania.\" and make no mistake, this is the goal. and if you doubt they can succeed at it because the level of brainwashing and absolute illiteracy of salient and science required to perpetrate such, i literally saw a journalist from a major newspaper on twitter asking in all sincere confusion about \"how can there be so many kinds of dogs with different sizes and shapes and intelligences? everything i know about genetics/eugenics says that this is impossible.\" (i wish i could find it to post, it was truly eye opening) genetic traits were heritable. genetic traits were never heritable. but this is 2022. and unlike poor winston and those alongside him, we DO have the receipts. the vaccines were supposed to stop spread. they did not and do not and are now likely accelerating it. and they knew this. and yet they did not change their policy. leaky vaccines are extremely dangerous, especially those that also engender strong antigenic fixation. they produce vaccine-driven evolution of viruses just as partially effective antibiotics lead to things like MRSA. and they knew this. and yet they did not change their policy. the process by which these vaccines were tested was incomplete, unsound, and slipshod to the point of outright recklessness. and they knew this. and yet, the minute they saw political advantage, they all changed their jerseys and acted as though they have been on team \"the fauci ouchie will save us all\" and not \"the trump terror needle is not to be trusted\" all along. oceanina, heretofore always in bloody and savage war with eastasia had now never been at war with eastasia. the enemy instead were the fifth columnists in our midst who had the treasonous temerity to be expressing the selfsame sentiments that had until yesterday issued from the mouths of those who would now suppress them. that which was known was conveniently forgotten. that which was science was now salacious lies. assessing vaxx is anti-vaxx. there are no laws in a system possessed of a sufficiently slippery past, not even laws of nature. and if we would retain the touchstones of reason in the face of this interminable erasure and amendment of antecedents then we must play the timecop and police our pasts to prevent the perpetration of the heinous and self-serving crime of grand theft history. if we would retain the practice of science, we must stand as their sheriff. knowledge is power. protect yours.
