AYURVEDA Institutional preparedness for NEP 1. Multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary: Most of the programmes run by the AIIA have interdisciplinary courses. These courses provide a global perspective on the domain area. Apart from these programs AIIA has introduced 5 more Certificate Courses of interdisciplinary nature. In addition to this, various interdisciplinary workshops and seminars are also conducted for the scholars like analytical techniques like HPTLC, HPLC, food technology; clinical skill development, emergency management skill etc. Scholars from all programs study about the environment, gender issues and professional ethics in these courses Scholars also have to take topics for dissertations which they have to complete during their 3 years schedule are interdisciplinary in nature. 2. Academic bank of credits (ABC): Indian government, under its new National Education Policy (NEP) plans to integrate modern medicine with the traditional systems of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH). For better integration of NEP in the existing system of , some of the important steps has to be taken, such as the adoption of innovative teaching methods with more emphasis on clinical skill development, providing a creative learning experience to the students, student-focused activities, faculty development programs, in place quality control mechanism, examination and evaluation reforms, research-oriented faculties, academia- industry collaborative approach, good availability of learning resources, and creating quality conscious environment. Through the implementation of NEP, a flawless coordinated linkage among Ayurveda education, research, clinical practice, and industry will be developed. Being a higher education institute, AIIA will definitely explore the feasibility of ABC because multiple entry and exits may affect the professional skills of the scholars. The institute is working by all means about how to implement ABC in the curriculum of Post Graduate teaching and education and will be fully prepared for its implementation and then will give feedback to NCISM the regulating body to incorporate the same in Ayurveda education.
