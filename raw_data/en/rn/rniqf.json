This is why we seek self-sufficiency and personalization on the farm by producing on it all the materials needed, such as green manure, compost, biodynamic preparations, use of legumes, associated crops and medicinal herbs. Biodynamic agriculture is carried out in most of Europe, North America and Australasia\". The farm or plantation is conceived as a closed system that self-feeds with natural preparations created in situ. In the same dynamic, diseases affecting its organisms are not treated in isolation, but as a symptom of imbalance in the global agricultural system. This systemic concept also applies to the integration of the crops and livestock in order to maximize the health and well-being of the plants and animals it incorporates, to maintain the soil in all its integrity and to recycle nutrients. Biodynamic agriculture incorporates many of the ideas of organic farming but predates that term\". Life Energy The meaning of \"biodynamic\" derives from two Greek words: \"bios\" (life) and \"dynamis\" (force), meaning the systematized search for the energy that creates and preserves life. Rudolf Steiner was the founder of the biodynamic approach to agriculture (born 27th February 1861, Austro-Hungarian Empire, died March 30th, 1925, Switzerland), Austrian scholar, philosopher and social thinker. Biodynamic agriculture addresses the ecological, economic and social aspects of farming\". Steiner founded anthroposophy, which comprises biodynamic agriculture. Anthroposophy is a movement studying the link between the universal and human essence. Steiner considered the world and its components from a monistic approach, in which the spiritual and the material are naturally interrelated. From this base, anthroposophy studies the capacity of the human being to perceive events beyond the visible, connecting with an intangible essence. Antroposophy, as a philosophy, seeks to develop a global understanding of mankind and the world\". Anthroposophical methodology has been described in Steiner\u00b4s books \"The Philosophy of Freedom\" and \"How to Know Higher Worlds?\" Against the denaturation of foods Steiner was ahead of his time in realising that the quality of food had been degraded by modern techniques, which he blamed on artificial fertilisers and pesticides. Based on the conviction that modern farming was harmful, he stated: Mineral fertilizers should be phased out completely as the effect of any type of mineral fertilizer used on field crops causes them over time to lose their nutritional value. This is an absolutely universal law.\" Likewise, he did not consider artificial nutrients equivalent to natural ones. The importance of the universe Biodynamic agriculture works in relation to the patterns of the Moon\u00b4s movements and the planets of our solar system. The best time to harvest is at a full moon.\" We know the influence of the Moon on Earth is self- evident. When there is a full moon our body suffers a decrease in the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, while the tides are governed by the moon\u00b4s gravitational pull. People, animals and plants are receptive to the cycles of the moon; thus, biodynamic agriculture takes into account the energy influence of the Moon to optimize crops The positive effects of biodynamic farming on food composition can be verified objectively.\" The rising Moon thus stimulates plant growth and the time comes to collect and perform grafting. On the contrary, when the moon is waning and the liquids are \"lowered\", this is the moment for planting, tilling and carrying out work on the roots and the soil in general. The lunar cycles have a strong impact on seeds and growth; therefore, in biodynamics the planting schedule is adjusted to the lunar phases. A full moon: This is the best moment to harvest, to turn the compost and plant fruit trees or plants. Root growth slows while growth of the parts above ground increases. Dividing the shrub is the best way to propagate plants Waning moon: Continuity must be given to the activities initiated during the full moon, and it is a very favourable stage for planting roots and tubers. New moon: This period is not conducive to farming. Weeding is the most appropriate task during this time. A waxing moon: It generates a dynamic of fertility that encourages the growth of green manures and all plants (except those with a premature flower, which must be planted with a waning moon) should be planted, preferably two to three days before the full moon. In biodynamics the constellation in which the Moon is found is taken into account, since it determines in which parts of the plant the energy is concentrated. In the same dynamic, diseases affecting its organisms are not treated in isolation, but as a symptom of imbalance in the global agricultural system\". Constellation of earth: the moment for roots and bark, favouring vegetables grown under the ground. Constellation of air: the energy favours flowers and flower vegetables. Constellation of water: the leaves are under its influence. Constellation of fire: Fruits and seeds are favoured. Biodynamic agriculture is so precise that the influence of the stars on the compost as well as the days most propitious for its preparation are taken into account. Phrases of Rudolf Steiner Anthroposophy is a path to knowledge that would guide the spiritual in mankind to the spiritual in the universe\". \"Anthroposophists may be those who ask certain questions about the essence of mankind and the world through a need as vital as what we feel when we are hungry and thirsty\". \"Spiritual evolution is not expressed by the capacity to store knowledge, declare truths or work miracles, but by the ability to "}
