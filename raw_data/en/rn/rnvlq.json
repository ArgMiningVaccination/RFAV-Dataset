Although the clinical benefit o f MEDI473 6 (durvalumab ) in combination with radiotherapy has not yet been established, the int ent of offering this treatment is to provide a possible therapeutic benefit, and thus the pa tient will be carefully monit ored for tumor res ponse. 1.3 Expl oratory O bjectives 1.3.1 To assess the impact the addition of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) has on progression -free survival, using irRC g . 1.3.2 To changes in circulati ng tumor cells (CTCs ) and var ious imm une parame ters during treatment w ith durva lumab and rad iotherapy and changes after completion of treatment . 2.0 BACKGROU ND 2.1 Current Management Approa ch and Rationale for Study (13-JAN-2021 ) Initially , the FDA approved the use of f rontline pembrol izumab instead of chemo therapy in NSCLC patients with high PD -L1 IHC expression (defined as a Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) 50% using either the Dako 22C3 antibody or the Ventana SP263 antibody platform 2017 ] based on KEYNO TE-024, which demonstra ted an im provement in median PFS (10. 3 vs 6 months, p<0.01), and improved 6-month overall sur vival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.6=0.005). The updated su rvival results reported at the Inter nation al Association for th e Stud y of Lung Canc er (IASLC) 2017 -0.86; P = .002) favoring pemb rolizumab. The median OS was 30.2 months for pembrolizum ab compared to 14.2 months with chem othera py. It should be not ed tha t these OS res ults held up in spite o f signifi cant cros s-over in the secon d-line setting to checkpoint inhibitors in the patients who received chemotherapy. Additionally, the overall res ponse rate (ORR) was improved with p embrol izumab (44.8% vs 27.8 %) wit h an increase in duration of response (not rea ched (NR) vs 6.3 months). Q uality of Life (QOL) analysis favored the pembrolizumab arm. In this population of patients, PD -1/PD -L1 inhibito rs are superior to systemic chemothe rapy i n metastatic NSCLC. The standard of ca re for local -regionally advanced NSCLC is concurrent chemora diation. However, 5 -year survival rates still hover aro und 20-25% for stage III NSCLC. Additional advances in t reatment options are needed. The re sults of the PACIFIC trial, a NRG -LU004 9 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 trial w hich adds consolidation MEDI4736 (durvalu mab) to standard chemoradiation, demonstrated significant improvement in pr ogression free survival (PFS) by 11 months (Antonia 2017) . There was not only a significantl y long er time to distant metastat ic disease or death (median 23.2 mont hs vs. 14 .6 months , HR 0.52 [(95% CI, 0.39-0.69)] but there was also a significantly greater overall response rate [(28.4% vs 16%, HR 1.78 (1.27 -2.51) ] and median duration of response [n ot rea ched vs. 13.8 months, HR 0. 43 (0.22-0.84) ] in the primary diseas e after c hemoradia tion. This suggest s that immunotherapy alone can exert effects that can ma intain local control of disease. This is seen even in pa tients without selection for PD -L1. It is expected that the PACIFIC regimen will b e a new standard of car e for unr esectable locally advanced NSCLC. However, there is significant toxicity of concurr ent chemoradiotherapy, which can significantly impact the patient's quality of life and survi val, e specially in elderly patien ts (Stinchcomb e 2017). Since the med ian age o f NSCLC i s 70 years old, muc h work is needed for an effective and less toxic treatme nt regimen for patients. Conventional radiotherapy (RT ) dose regimen of 60 Gy in 30 fracti ons is the current standard dosin g (Perez 1980, Bradley 2015). Accele rated hyp ofraction ated RT (ACRT) increases the biologic equivalent dose and thereby improve d isease control. There has been abundant clinical experien ce using ACRT without concurrent che mother apy to achieve excell ent lo cal control fo r both early and locall y advance d disease (Cheung et al, 2014). ACRT can also synergize with immunotherapy in many preclinical models, showing anti -PD-L1 antibody enhanced the efficacy of radiation through a CD8 T cell dependent mechan ism (D eng, Weichselb aum 2014, Deng, Beckett 2014). The anti-tumor effect was se en both locally in the primary tumor, and also contralat eral, non-irradiated tumor, supporting the role of radiat ion an immunologic \"distant \", or abscopal, anti-tumor effect . Even more i mportant is the demonst ration th at it was the concomitant administration, and not the sequential administration, of anti-PD-L1 with radiation, that improved tumor control an d survival in the mice (Dovedi et al , 2014 ). It is for these reason s that we beli eve that the systemic e ffects an d local c ontrol effects of checkpoint inhibitors will even be greater in patients wi th high expression of PD -L1, as demonstrated in Keynote 0 24. This is the primary rationale w hy we are selecting patient s with PD-L1 high ex pressing tumors to repl ace concu rrent che motherapy for immun otherapy in combination with radiotherapy in our trial. This benefit shouldn't be confined to only the patients who are not eligible for chemotherap y, but all patients who are eligible for chemot herapy will likely bene fit more from immu notherapy. Howev er, ACRT with systemic therapy may cause concerning side effects that will be greater than just ACRT alone. Whil e this is not known if such side eff ects w ill be increased with immun otherapies, th ere is experience with platinum -based dou blet chemotherapy t hat may raise similar concerns. CALGB 31102 (Alliance) was a phase I study to escalate the dose per fraction whi le keeping the total dose at 60 Gy i n orde r to define the maxim ally t olerated cours e of accelerated radiat ion thera py with c oncurrent chemother apy. With 21 evaluable patients, only modest hypofracti onation was achieved, with the MTD defined in cohort 2 at 60 Gy in 2.5 Gy/fraction, with 2 pa tients in cohort 2 sustaine d grad e 5 toxicities (hemoptysis, pneumonit is)(Urban ic al. -LU004 10 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 current trial does not combine chemotherapy, which is k nown as a radiation sensitizer, there are potential hazar ds of combining with immunotherapy t hat wi ll require very close monit oring of the p otential additive or sy nergistic toxiciti es. We are conduct ing the current study taking those safety concerns into consideration. MEDI4736 (durvalumab) Mechanism of ac tion mono the immunoglobul in (Ig) G (IgG) 1 kappa subclass that blo cks the interaction of programmed cell death ligand (PD-L) 1 (but not PD -L2) with PD-1 on T cells and cluster of differentiation (CD ) 80 (B7.1) on immune cells (IC). It is being developed by Astr aZenec a/Me dImmune fo r use in the treatment of cancer (MedImmu ne is a wholly owne d subsidiary of AstraZeneca; AstraZeneca/MedImmune will be referred to as AstraZeneca throughout this document.). MEDI4736 (durvalumab) has been eng ineere d to reduce antibody -depend ent cellular cytotoxicity and complem ent-depen dent cyto toxicity. In vitro studies demonstrate that (durvalumab) antagoni zes the inhibitory effect of PD -L1 on primary human T cells, resulting in their restored prol iferat ion and rel ease of in terfer on gamma (IFN ) (Stewart et al, 2015). 2.2 Clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) As of October 24, 2016, PK data from study CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1108 were available for 993 patients following t reatment with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) at 0.1 to 10 mg/k g every two week s (Q2W) and 15 mg/kg every three weeks (Q3W) (dose -escalation), 10 mg/kg Q2W (dose -expansion), and 20 mg/kg every four weeks (Q4W) (dose -exploration), administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 60 minutes. The maxim um pla sma concent ration (C max) increased in an approximately dose -proportional manner over the dose range examined. The area under the concentration -time curve from 0 to 14 days (AUC 0-14) increased dose -proportionally a t doses of 3 to 20 mg/kg and more th an dos e- proportio nally at d oses o f <3 mg/kg, likely due to saturable target -mediated clearance (CL). The steady state was achieved at approximately Week 16. Accumulation of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) was observed following repeated dosing. Mean accumulation ratio (AR) ranged from 0.64 to 1.87 and 3.16 to 4.93 for C max and (trough plasma concentration (C trough), respectively. Near complete target saturation (sPD -L1 and membrane bound) is expected with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) 3 mg/kg Q2W. Clinical safety summary 12, 2017, MEDI4736 (durvalumab) 10 mg/kg Q2W has been given to more than 1800 patients from three MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy studies (CD -ON- MEDI4736 -1108, ATLANTIC and PACIFIC). The majority of tre atment -related AEs were manageable with dose delays, symptomatic treatment, and in the case of events suspected to have an immune basis, the use of established treatment guidelines for immune -mediated toxicity (see the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Mana gement Guidelines in Section 6 ). However, life -threatening and fatal events have been reported. NRG -LU004 11 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 Adverse events (AEs) that were considered by the investigator as related to M EDI4736 (durvalumab) in 5% of patients (6.4%), and rash (6.4%). AEs of Grade 3 or higher considered related to MEDI4736 (durvalumab) were rep orted in 201 patient s (10.6%): 177 patients (9.4%) had events of Grade 3, 13 patients (0.7%) had events of Grade 4, and 11 patients (0.6%) had Grade 5 (fatal) events. The only Grade 5 event considered related to MEDI4736 (durvalumab) occurring in 2 patie nts was pneumonitis (5 patients [0.3%]). A total of 108 patients (5.7%) had serious AEs (SAEs) that were considered by the investigator as related to MEDI4736 (durvalumab) . AEs of special interest (AESI) The in AstraZeneca or MedImmune -sponsored MEDI4736 (d urvalumab) studies are defined as AEs that include, but are not limited to, events with a potential inflammatory or immune -mediated mechanism that may require more frequent monitoring and/or interventions such as corticosteroids, immuno suppressants, and/or endocrine therapy. Early recognition of signs and symptoms potentially related to an inflammatory or immune -mediated mechanism is important for proper management of toxicities. For guidance on identifying, evaluating, and treating AESIs/imAEs, see the Toxicity Management Guidelines. AESI/imAEs observed with anti PD -L1/PD -1 agents such gravis and Gu illain -Barre syndrom e. Other inflammatory responses that are rare with a potential immune -mediated etiology include, but are not limited to, pericarditis, sarcoidosis, uveitis and other events involving the eye, skin, hematological and rheumatological eve nts. It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune mediated mechanism could occur in nearly all organs. In addition, infusion -related reactions and hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions with a different underlying pharmacological etiology a re also considered A ESIs. The summary information for the AESIs below, unless stated otherwise, are based on the DCO of July 12, 2017. Pneumonitis Across the MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy pooled dataset pneumonitis (pneumonitis, inter lung disease (ILD), acute interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis) were reported at a frequency rate of Common (98/1889; 5.2%). Most were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and most were reported as PT pneumonitis (88 patients [4.7%]). CTC Grade 3 pneumonitis (PT) was reported in 15 patients (0.8%); NRG -LU004 12 Vers ion Date: November 3, Grade 4 in 1 patient (<0.1%) and CTC Grade 5 pneumonitis in 5 patients (0.3%). CTC Grade 3 ILD (PT) has been reported from studies outside of the pooled dataset. There were no CTC Grade 4 or 5 even ts of ILD. Presenta tions of pneumonitis can range from asymptomatic lung infiltrates to those that mimic severe bacterial pneumonia (Teply and Lipson 2014). Early consideration of pneumonitis should be realized when patients present with new onset or wor sening of respirator y symptoms such as dyspnea or cough. Prompt treatment with steroids is important as per current established Toxicity Management Guidelines. Hepatitis Immune -mediated hepatitis/hepatic toxicity is the inflammation of the liver. Hepati c AEs induced by PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors commonly present as asymptomatic increase of aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), rarely total bilirubin. A proportion of patients may be presenting with fatigue, fever and radiologic appearances includin g hepatomegaly, periportal lymphadenopathy and periportal edema (Zhang et al, 2016). As a grouped term, selected hepatic events including laboratory abnormalities were reportedly 12.0% (227 patients) across 1889 patients who (durval umab) monotherapy mg/kg (autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis toxic, hepatocellular injury, hepatotoxicity and hepatitis) were reported at a frequency rate of Uncommon (14 patients; 0.7%). Seven of the 14 events of hepatitis were Grad e 3. There were no Grade 4 events with the exception of hepatitis acute (1 patient) reported outside of the pooled dataset. One patient experienced a CTC Grade 5 event of autoimmune hepatitis. Other AESIs such as hepatic failure (5 p atients), jaundice (5 patients), hyperbilirubinemia (15 patients) and laboratory abnormality AESIs have been observed, 3 of which were CTC Grade 5 (hepatic failure, hyperbilirubinemia and transaminases increased). Monitoring liver function tests while r eceiving study medic ation is important as hepatitis often manifests as asymptomatic elevated levels of hepatic transaminases (ALT, AST, bilirubin; Kim et al, 2013). Prompt treatment with steroids is important as per current established Toxicity Management Guidelines. Coliti s Diarrhea is the most frequent AESI reported across the Phase I to Phase III clinical studies with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy with a frequency of Very common (329/1889; in patients receiving 10 mg/kg MEDI4736 (durvalumab) IV Q2W. Most of th ese were Grade 1. Treatment -emergent colitis -type AESIs were reported at a frequency of Common (21 of 1889 patients; 1.1%). Most were Grade 2 or 3. CTC Grade 4 colitis was reported in 1 patient (rare; <0.1%). Patients should be moni tored for signs and symptoms of colitis or diarrhea. Investigators are instructed to begin diarrhea management early to minimize the risk of colitis (please refer to the Toxicity Management Guidelines). Early initiation of diarrhea treatment NRG -LU004 13 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 guidelines h as been shown to red uce bowel perforation and colectomy rates, drug -related diarrhea, and serious gastrointestinal imAEs by up to 50% in patients treated with ipilimumab (Tarhini 2013). Intestinal perforation Full thickness injury of the bowel wall and su bsequent perforation of the gastrointestinal tract can be due to a variety of etiologies, commonly instrumentation, surgery, bowel injury, bowel obstruction, neoplasms (particularly colon carcinoma) and concomitant medications such as prolonged use of non -steroidal inflammato ry drugs (NSAIDs). Spontaneous perforation can be related to inflammatory changes or tissues weakened by medications or connective tissue disorders (Cahalane 2016). Across the MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy pool of studies, intes tinal perforation was reported at a frequency rate of Uncommon (2/1889; 0.1%); Grades 2 and 4. There were no Grade 5 events. Monitor for symptoms that may be related to bowel perforation such as sepsis, peritoneal signs, and ileus (refer to the Toxicity Management Guideline s for diarrhea/colitis). Investigators should adhere to the overall management for immune -mediated toxicities by performing a thorough evaluation to rule out alternative etiologies and by initiating prompt treatment including steroids. Endocrinopathies Immune -mediated endocrinopathy is the inflammation of any organ in the hypothalamic - pituitary -adrenal axis, but is most typically reported to affect the pituitary, thyroid and/or adrenal glands, leading to hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, t hyroid dysfunction, and/or adrenal insufficiency (Teply and Lipson 2014). The clinical presentation of immune - mediated endocrinopathies most often include hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and nonspecific symptoms of headache and fatigue, but may also incl ude myalgias, visual field defects, behavioral changes, electrolyte disturbances, loss of appetite and hypotension (Tarhini 2013). Patients with endocrinopathies may present with abnormal endocrine laboratory test results including thyroid -stimulating hor mone (TSH), T4, luteinizing hormone, follicle - stimulating hormone, and testosterone. Frequencies for immune -mediated endocrinopathy, as grouped terms of AESIs including laboratory abnormality AEs, are indicated in the NRG -LU004 14 Vers ion Date: November 3, Common 135 (7.1%) Common 78 (7.2%) Adrenal insufficiency a Uncommon 13 (0.7%) Common 21 (1.9%) Hypophysitis/Hypopituitarism a Rare 1 (<0.1%) Uncommon 24 (0.4%) Type 1 diabetes mellitus Rare 1 (<0.1%) 0 (0.0%) aGrouped term based on a number of individual MedDRA PTs. AESI adverse event of special interest; MedDRA Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; N total number patients; PT preferred term; Q2W every 2 weeks; Q4W every 4 weeks. Most endocrinopathy eve nts reported were Gr ade 1 or 2. In the monotherapy pool, Grade 3 events consisted of adrenal insufficiency (2 patients), hypophysitis/hypopituitarism (1 patient), hyperthyroidism (1 patient) and hypothyroidism (2 patients). There were no CTC Grade 4 or 5 events. In the com bination, AESIs for hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (including laboratory abnormalities) were the most frequently observed events with frequency rates of Very common (12.6%) and Common (7.2%), respectively. The severity of these eve nts are predominantl y Grades 1 and 2 with Grade 3 events observed with hyperthyroidism only (0.5%). Adrenal insufficiency was reported as mostly Grades 2/3 with 1 Grade 4 event and no Grade 5 events. Hypophysitis or hypopituitarism was reported as mostly Grade 3 with no Gra de 4 or 5 events. Across the monotherapy pool of studies, 1 patient (<0.1%) experienced Grade 3 Type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient, a 60 year old Caucasian male with NSCLC without a history of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia, de severe autoi mmune -mediated days after starting MEDI4736 (durvalumab) , was tested positive for anti -GAD antibody 322 U/mL (reference range 0 to 5 U/mL) and was negative for B -islet antibody. He was diagnos ed with Type 1 diabe tes mellitus and was treated with insulin; the DM resolved with sequelae (insulin dependency). Prompt recognition and management of endocrinopathies is important. Refer to the endocrinology section of the Toxicity Management Guideli nes. Nephritis The major clinical syndromes produced by immune -mediated renal injury include nephrotic syndrome, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and acute renal failure (Cunard and Kelly 2003). In association to immune -checkpoint inhibitors, two different forms of i pilimumab -induced renal damage are reported, acute kidney injury due to predominant acute granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis and nephrotic syndrome in lupus nephritis (Izzedine et al, 2014). Signs and symptoms include increase in serum creatinine, decrease in urine output, peripheral edema, hematuria, loss of appetite. As a grouped term, selected renal events including laboratory abnormalities were reported at a frequency of 6.3% (119 patients) across the 1889 patients includ ed in the MEDI4736 ( durvalumab) monotherapy pool. Blood creatinine was the most common event reported (4.0%), of which the majority were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Nephritis events were reported at a frequency rate of Uncommon (6 patients [0.3%]) with 1 e vent NRG -LU004 15 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2 glomerulonephritis membranous, and nephritis and 2 tubulointerstitial nephritis (Grade 2 and 3). Patients should be monitored for changes in renal function (e.g., that manifest as elevated serum blood urea nitr ogen and creatinine, decreased creatinine CL, electrolyte imbalance, decrease in urine output, or proteinuria and any other findings that may be indicative of nephritis) prior to and periodically during treatment. Prompt treatment with steroids is importa nt as per current established Toxicity Management Guidelines. Rash/dermatitis Immune -mediated dermatitis is generally mild and presents as mild local or diffuse maculo -papular, erythematous rash on the trunk or extremities, which may b e accompanied by pru ritus, alopecia, and vitiligo, suggestive of inflammatory response to melanocytes (Lacouture et al, 2014). In rare cases, severe dermatitis has been reported to manifest as Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or rashe s complicated by mal ulceration or necrotic, bullous, or hemorrhagic manifestations (Tarhini et al, 2013, Kaehler et al, 2010). AESIs of rash (as a composite term) were reported as Very common in 283 (15.0%) patients receiving MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy and Very c ommon in 256 (23.5%) patients receiving the combination. The majority of events were CTC Grade 1, with 11 and 7 patients, respectively, experiencing CTC Grade 3 events. AESIs falling under the grouped term of dermatitis include milder events such as prur itus, eczema and erythema to more specific or severe toxicities such as events of dermatitis bullous, dermatitis exfoliative or dermatitis psoriasiform. Overall, these events have been reported as Very common (n=299; 15.8%) in mon otherapy. Most even ts were Grade 1, with 3 patients in the monotherapy group. Close monitoring, early detection and prompt treatment with steroids (topical or systemic based on severity) is important. Refer to the Toxicity Management Guidelines. Myocar ditis In the literat ure for other immune checkpoint inhibitors, a variety of clinical presentations, diagnostic evidence (laboratory, imaging, histopathology), and resulting diagnoses have been described in cases of myocarditis, including heart failure, br ady- and tachyarrhyt hmias, and acute coronary syndrome -like presentations without evidence of ischemia. Treatments are variable, and include immunosuppression and beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and diuretics. Outcomes can range from rapid response and re solution with immuno suppression to fulminant, fatal events. Across the MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy pool of studies, as of the DCO of July 12, 2017, there has been 1 serious report of Grade 3 myocarditis and 2 additional cases (Grade 3 and Grade 4) outside of the poole d dataset. In all cases the patients recovered or were improving with corticosteroid therapy. NRG -LU004 16 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 Investigators should be aware of such rare, but severe immune -mediated adverse events including myocarditis with its presenting signs/sympto ms (e.g., decreased ejection fraction, arrhythmias, in particular occurrences of atrioventricular block). For patients with suspected myocarditis, investigators should obtain a cardiology consult and institute full diagnostic work -up (that includes excl usion of other alter nate causes such as infection) and the appropriate management that includes discontinuing drug (permanently if myocarditis is confirmed) and the prompt use of steroids or other immunsosuppressives. Patients with pre -existing cardiac di sorders should be cl osely monitored for deterioration in their cardiac condition, which could suggest new onset myocarditis. Myositis/polymyositis The diagnosis of myositis or polymyositis should be suspected in patients who present with proximal muscle w eakness and the eval uation should include an examination of the skin, muscle enzyme measurement, antibody testing, any systemic disease manifestations and exclusion of other diseases including drug -induced myopathy. Cases of myositis have been reported wi th myocarditis in wh ich immune infiltration has been described in skeletal and cardiac muscle (Johnson et al, 2016). In the MEDI4736 (durvalumab) pool of studies as of the DCO, 3 patients (0.2%) reported the event of myositis, including 1 Grade 3 in sever ity. Outside of the pooled dataset, there were 2 fatal events of polymyositis considered as treatment -related by the Investigator. Investigators should adhere to the Toxicity Management Guidelines by performing a thorough evaluation to rule out alternati ve etiologies and in itiating prompt treatment with steroids and modification of study drug dose regimen depending on the severity of the event. Refer to the Toxicity Management Guidelines. Pancreatitis Pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pa ncreas that typicall y manifests initially as asymptomatic elevations of amylase and lipase in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Clinical presentation frequently includes low -grade abdominal pain with accompanying fever and malaise (Weber et al, 2012, Di Gia como et al, 2010). Biopsies showed diffuse T -cell infiltrate consistent with immune -mediated pancreatitis (Weber et al, 2012). Across the 1889 patients in the monotherapy program, events of pancreatitis were Uncommon to Rare. Four pa tients (0.2%) experi enced pancreatitis (Grade 2, Grade 3 and Grade 4 in severity) and 1 patient (<0.1%) with Grade 3 acute pancreatitis. Elevations in amylase and lipase were reported as Uncommon (0.6% and 0.5%, respectively). Patients should be monito red for signs and sy mptoms of pancreatitis including Grade 3 or 4 elevations in lipase and/or amylase. Close monitoring, early detection and prompt treatment of these events are important. Refer to the Toxicity Management Guidelines. NRG -LU004 17 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 Other rare or less frequent AESIs and i mmune -mediated adverse events Events with an inflammatory or immune mediated mechanism could occur in nearly all organs. ImAEs that are less frequent with a potential immune -mediated etiology include, but are not limited to: pericard itis, sarcoidosis, u veitis, and other events involving the eye (e.g., keratitis and optic neuritis), skin (e.g., scleroderma and vitiligo), as Guillain -Barre Syndrome and myasthenia gravis have also been observed. One patient receiving MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy outside of the pooled dataset experienced Gra de 4 myasthenia grav is Prompt treatment of these conditions as per current Toxicity Management Guidelines is required. Infusion -related reactions, anaphylaxis and allergic reactions Adverse reactions that occur during or shortly after infusion may includ e fever, chills, hypotension, dyspnea, bronchospasm, wheeze, cough, dizziness, fatigue, headache, hypertension rash, headache, flushing, sweating, myalg ia, nausea, vomiting , unresponsiveness, and hemodynamic instability. The typical onset can be within 30 minutes to 2 hours after the initiation of drug infusion, although symptoms may be delayed for up to 24 hours. The majority of reactions occur after t he first or second exposure to the agent, but between 10% and 30% occur during subsequent treatments (Lenz 2007). Anaphylaxis is a systemic, immediate hypersensitivity reaction that is mediated by interactions between factors released from IgE and mast ce lls; these interacti ons result in an antigen -antibody reaction. Clinical manifestations of acute allergic reactions may range from localized skin reactions at the injection site to AEs, which can include, but are not limited to, those events similar to in fusion -related react ions to severe reactions including anaphylaxis and drug hypersensitivity syndromes. These reactions may be more common with higher rates of infusion, and in patients with a history of allergies. Patients participating in MEDI4736 (dur valumab) clinical st udies should be closely monitored during and after infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions should be managed according to standard clinical practice, and medical equipment and staff trained to treat acute anaphylactic reactions mu st be immediately av ailable at all sites that perform mAb infusions. Cytokine release syndrome Certain mAb therapeutics have been shown to induce a range of acute infusion reactions including cytokine -release syndrome that can lead to AEs in patients. A s of the DCO date, t here have been no reported events of cytokine release syndrome in the ongoing MEDI4736 (durvalumab) studies. NRG 18 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 Immune -complex disease The potential risk of immune complex disease for MEDI4736 (durvalumab) is theoretical based on the know n risk associated wi th mAbs and other proteins. The incidence of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) ADA -positive patients in clinical studies is low, and hence the risk of immune complex disease is likely to be low. Specifically, of 1124 patients treated with MEDI473 6 (durvalumab) 10 mg /kg Q2W and evaluable for the presence of ADAs, 3.3% of patients tested positive for treatment -emergent ADAs. Neutralizing antibodies against MEDI4736 (durvalumab) were detected in 0.3% of patients. The presence of ADAs did not have a clinically relevant effect on PK. There have been no reported events of immune complex reactions in patients receiving MEDI4736 (durvalumab) . For guidance on identifying, evaluating, and treating an imAE please see the Toxicity Management Guidelines. 2.2.2 Infections In addition to infections determined as ADRs, other infections are considered as potential risks based on the potential mechanism of action of checkpoint inhibitors. Serious and/or Grade 3 infections requiring hospitalization includin g, but not limited to, sepsis, pneumonia, lung infections, have been reported in clinical studies with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) , but are often confounded by underlying disease and use of concomitant medications (e.g., steroids and other immunosuppressives). As of the DCO, events from the MedDRA Infections and Infestations SOC, events with a severity Grade 3 and frequency of 1% in the monotherapy pool included lung infection (n=21; 1.1%). Overall, CTC Grade 3 events were reported in 143 patients (7.6%), CTC Grade 4 events were reported in 36 patients (1.9%) and CTC Grade 5 infection events in 18 patients (1.0%). Non-serious infections have been reported in clinical studies with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) . Of the ADRs under the MedDRA Infections and Infestations SOC, events reported as non -serious only and with a frequency of AND INELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Note: Per NCI guidelines, exceptions to inclusion and exclusion criteria are not permitted.

See Appendix I for details. 5. TREATMENT PLAN/R EGIMEN DESCRIPTION Systemic therapy protocol treatment with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) must start within 2 weeks of trial registration and 2 weeks (Day -14) prior (+/ - 48 hours) to the start of RT. 5.1 MEDI4736 (durvalumab) NOTE: Please refer to the Investigator Brochure for complete details on safety and treatment information. [See Section 9 .1 for instructions about how to obtain the IB and preparation of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) .] MEDI4736 (durvalumab) will be administered intravenously as a 1500 mg fixed dose over 60 minutes starting 2 weeks ( Day -14 +/- 48 hour s) prior to starting radiation therapy, for 13 cycles (1 cycle = 4 weeks), until disease progression or toxicity or death, whichever comes first (see Section 5.2.6 ). Patients must be monitored before and after the infusion with assessment of vital signs at the times specified in Section 4 and as clinically indicated . During the infusion period, patients must be monitored (pulse rate, blood pressure) every 30 minutes (including times where infusion rate is slowed or temporarily stopped). If RT is held or discontinued, MEDI4736 (durvalumab) may be continued as scheduled. In patients who require dose delays, MEDI4736 (durvalumab) will be continued as soon as the patient meets retreatment cri teria, and the full dose of 1500 mg will be administered. If the patient does not meet retreatment criteria before the next scheduled dose, if/when the toxicity resolves to the point where treatment is possible, the doses of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) are appli ed off schedule q 4 weeks. The missing doses will not be made up.

Pre-treatment review is required for each treatment plan prior to the start of RT. Three (3) business days are required for the pre - treatment review once all required data is received in completion. Refer to Section 12.1 for submission details. Daily IGRT wi ll be used for all patients. 5.2.1 Treatment Technology Three -dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D -CRT) or Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) is allowed. Proton Beam Therapy is not allowed. IMRT delivered from units with capabilities in cluding Tomotherapy, ViewRay and VMAT are permitted. For photons, beam energy of 6 -10 MV will be used. Daily image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) using orthogonal X -ray, cone beam CT, CT on rails, or MR guidance must be used for all patients, regardless of radiation techniques. Multi -leaf collimation (MLC) will be used to spare normal tissues outside of the target volume. 5.2.2 Immobilization and Simulation Immobilization Proper immobilization is critical for this protocol. Patient setup reproducibil ity must be achieved using appropriate clinical devices. Alpha cradles or Vac-Lok devices are used for shoulder immobilization. Arms are abducted bilaterally with hands above the head (preferably in all cases unless patients are incapable of doing so but setup must be reproducible daily and treatment planning will accommodate for the deviation). Simulation Imaging Simulation CTs should be CT slices of 3 mm slice thickness starting from the level of the cricoid cartilage and extending inferiorly through the entire liver volume. Administration of intravenous (I.V.) contrast during simulation CT is optional provided a diagnostic CT with contrast has been done to help delineate the major blood vessels. If such diagnostic CT is not available, I.V. contrast should be given during the treatment planning CT. In the case in which contrast is present during the treatment planning CT, the density of the contrast should be overridden to a representative background electron density. NRG -LU004 28 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 Motion Management Technique The use of four -dimensional radiation treatment planning is highly encouraged to account for respiratory motion in the treatment planning process. Other methods permitted are active breath hold, gated treatment and abdominal compression. 5.2.3 Imaging for Structure Definition and Image Registration A volumetric treatment planning CT study will be required to define gross tumor volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), and planning target volume (PTV)(see definitions below). Contiguous CT slices, having n o more than 3 mm thickness through the regions harboring gross tumor and grossly enlarged lymph nodes and no more than 10 mm thickness of the remaining regions are to be obtained starting from the level of the cricoid cartilage and extending inferiorly through the entire liver volume. The GTV, CTV, and PTV and critical structures will be outlined on all appropriate CT slices. A treatment planning FDG PET/CT scan (or FDG -PET alone) with the patient in the treatment position is encouraged for treatment plan ning. In the case where the PET/CT is obtained in the treatment position, the CT from this study may be used as the planning CT scan. Otherwise, a diagnostic PET/CT used for staging could be used for target delineation with image co -registration with the planning CT. 5.2.4 Definition of Target Volumes and Margins Note: All structures must be named for digital RT data submission as listed in the table below. The structures marked as \"Required\" in the table must be contoured and submitted with the treatment plan. Structures marked as \"Required when applicable\" must be contoured and submitted when applicable. Resubmission of data may be required if labeling of structures does not conform to the standard DICOM name listed. Capital letters, spacing and us e of underscores must be applied exactly as indicated. There are two tables below. The first table (Table A) applies to patients being treated using the non-preferred motion management method. The second table (Table B) applies only to patients being pla nned with 4DCT with maximum intensity projection of the tumor volume based on the entire tumor motion. Contouring of the ITV_6000 is necessary only when the ITV approach is used.

Accounting for Tumor Motion Approaches and Internal and Setup Margins Internal margin (IM): The IM used will be dictated by the motion management decision made at time of simulation. 1. If the simulation is done with a free -breathing CT only, the IM will be 1 cm in the superior -inferior direction and 0.5 cm in the axial direction. 2. If simulation is done with abdominal compression, the IM will be 0.8 cm in the superior - inferior direction and 0.5 cm in the axial direction. 3. If simulation is done using an active breath -hold or gated breathing technique, the IM will be 0.5 cm in all directions. 4. If simulation is done using a 4DCT to develop a maximum intensity projection of the tumor volume, no IM is needed. Setup margin (SM): Daily IGRT is a requirement for this trial; therefore, the SM will be 0.5 cm in all directions. GTV_6000 : The primary tumor and clinically positive lymph nodes seen either on the planning CT (> 1cm short ax is diameter) or pre -treatment PET scan (SUV > 3) will constitute the GTV. This volume(s) may be disjointed. In the event of a collapsed lobe or lung segment, the use of PET to distinguish tumor from fluid/atelectasis is encouraged. CTV_6000 : The CTV is defined to be the GTV plus a 0.5cm to 1cm margin as appropriate to account for microscopic tumor extension. If an IGTV is used then a 0.5cm to 1cm margin is added to the IGTV to form a CTV. The CTV should be adjusted to not expand into other organs such as esophagus, major blood vessels, or bone. IGTV_6000: The primary tumor and clinically positive lymph nodes seen on the planning CT (> 1 cm short axis diameter) and pre -treatment PET scan (SUV > 3) over the course of a respiratory cycle. This volume(s) m ay be disjointed. In the event of a collapsed lobe or lung segment, the use of PET to distinguish tumor from fluid/atelectasis is encouraged. Maximum intensity projection image may be used for contouring, with verification against all breathing phases. NRG -LU004 30 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 ITV_6000: The ITV will be equal to the IGTV plus a 0.5 cm clinical margin as appropriate to account for microscopic tumor extension. PTV_6000 : The PTV will be equal to the ITV+IM+SM. SM is defined in Detailed Specifications paragraph above. In cases in wh ich the PTV expansion extends outside of the skin, towards the spinal cord or into the spinal canal, it can be assumed that tumor motion will not occur in this direction, and the PTV margin in this direction can be limited. PTV margin can be limited up to 0.5cm towards this particular dimension (skin or spinal canal). 5.2.5 Definition of Critical Structures and Margins Note: All structures must be named for digital RT data submission as listed in the table below. The structures marked as \"Required\" in th e table must be contoured and submitted with the treatment plan.

Radiation treatment wi ll be administered 5 days per week, 1 fraction per day. It is recommended that radiation treatment begin on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Treatment may begin on Thursday though not preferred. There are no field reductions. All fields must be treated daily and the entire PTV must be treated daily. Note: The information provided in this section can be used for adjusting the dose constraints for treatment planning purposes. This table together with the planning priority table should be used during dos e optimization. It is important to remember that ideal plans might not be achievable in all cases. Thus, the Compliance Criteria table could be different than the information given here. Cases will be scored using the Compliance Criteria table. Radiati on Therapy in the form of conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (Cohort 2 and Expansion Cohort 4): Photon radiation should be carried out using standard fractionated radiation therapy in 2 Gy per fraction for a total dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions . Radiation treatment will be administered 5 days per week, 1 fraction per day. It is recommended that radiation treatment begin on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Treatment may begin on Thursday though not preferred. There are no field reductions. A ll fields must be treated daily and the entire PTV must be treated daily.

Given the limitations inherent in the treatment planning process, the numbers given in this section can be different than the prescription table. The Per Protocol and Variation Acceptable categories are both considered to be acceptable. The Per Protocol cases can be viewed as ideal plans, and the Variation Acceptable category can include more challenging plans that do not fall at or near th e ideal results. A final category, called Deviation Unacceptable, results when cases do not meet the requirements for either Per Protocol or Variation Acceptable. Plans falling in this category are considered to be suboptimal and additional treatment plan ning optimization is recommended. Normalization of Dose: The plan is normalized such that 95% of the PTV_6000 volume receives prescription dose of 60 Gy.

Any algorithm used for this study must be credentialed by IROC Houston. For Convolution/Superposition type algorithms, dose should be reported as com puted inherently by the given algorithm. For Monte Carlo or Grid Based Boltzmann Solver algorithms, conversion of Dm (dose -to-medium) to Dw (dose -to-water) should be avoided. Dm, computed inherently by these algorithms, should be reported. These princip les hold for Pencil Beam type algorithms and for homogeneous dose calculations when allowed for a clinical trial (e.g., conical collimators in stereotactic radiosurgery). Primary dataset for dose calculation The primary dataset for dose calculation must b e a free -breathing CT that was acquired along with 4DCT, an average intensity pixel CT (AveIP) generated from the 4DCT, the breath - hold/gated CT, or the free -breathing CT acquired with no other motion management. Maximum Intensity Pixel (MIP) generated im ages from 4DCTs may not be used as the primary dose calculation dataset. In the case in which contrast is present during the treatment planning CT, the density of the contrast should be overridden to a representative background electron density. Dose matri x resolution Dose grid size should be <= 3 mm in all directions. 5.2.9 Patient specific QA Any patient -specific QA that needs to be acquired should follow institutional guidelines and AAPM task group report recommendations. For IMRT/VMAT plans, patie nt specific QA is highly recommended. The recommended patient specific QA criterion is for 90% of the comparison points to pass a \u00b13%/3mm Gamma Index analysis. 5.2.10 Daily Treatment Localization/IGRT Image -guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is radiation t herapy using imaging to facilitate accuracy and precision throughout its entire process from target and normal tissue delineation, to radiation delivery, to adaptation of therapy to anatomic and biological changes over time in individual patients. In this section we use the terminology IGRT to focus on image -guidance at the time of radiation delivery to ensure its adherence to the planned treatment. NRG -LU004 36 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 Daily image guidance that allows for 3D shifts is the minimum requirement for this trial. Most advanced ima ging techniques can be utilized, as long as they also allow for 3D shifts. The setup margin in this trial is tied to the use of daily image guidance. When able to localize using soft tissue, the target will be most effective for localization. Other soft tissues in the lung such as the carina can help for mediastinal alignment. Fiducial markers can be used for localization as needed. Bony alignment as a surrogate is also acceptable. Any linear shifts seen that are 2 mm should be applied prior to treat ment. -Minimal IGRT requirements Location No Fiducials With Fiducials** Lung* Imaging that allows for 3D shifts Imaging that allows for 3D shifts *Registration using a soft tissue surrogate for the tumor is recommended. Free -breathing CTs are not to be used as reference images for 4D CBCT IGRT process **Clearly visible anatomical markers are acceptable as fiducials, e.g. inserted radio opaque markers. 5.2.11 Case Review Pre-treatment reviews are required for all cases . See Sections 8.3 and 12.1 for specifics on submission process and requirements. RT may not begin until approval is received. Three (3) business days are required for the pre -treatment review once all required data is rece ived in completion. 5.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines 5.3.1 Permitted Supportive/Ancillary Care and Concomitant Medications All supportive therapy for optimal medical care will be given during the study period at the dis cretion of the attending physician(s) within the parameters of the protocol and documented on each site's source documents as concomitant medication. Anticonvulsants Hematopoietic active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) Megastrol administered as appetite stimulant is acceptable while the patient is enrolled in the study Premedication may be administered at the discretion of the treating physician. The u se of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for patients with orthostatic adrenocortical insufficiency is allowed. 5.3.2 Therapies Not Permitted: Traditional herbal medicines should not be administered becau se the ingredients of many herbal medicines are not fully studied and their use may result in unanticipated drug interactions that may cause, or confound assessment of, toxicity; Patients are not allowed to receive immunostimulatory agents, including but n ot NRG -LU004 37 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 limited to IFN -, IFN -, or IL -2, during the entire study. These agents, in combination with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) , could potentially increase the risk for autoimmune conditions. Patients should also not be receiving immunosuppressive medications, incl uding but not limited to cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, or thalidomide. These agents could potentially alter the activity and the safety of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) . Systemic corticosteroids may be administered at the discretion of the treati ng physician. If feasible, alternatives should be considered. Patients who donate blood while participating in this study, or: 1) for at least 90 days following the last infusion of durvalumab; or 2) 90 days after receipt of the final dose of durvaluma b; or 3) until after 4 -5X the half -life of durvalumab or until the time specified in the prescribing information of durvalumab, whichever occurs longest. Colony stimulating factors, including G -CSF, pegylated G -CSF are not permitted at any time. Erythropo ietin analogs are not recommended, but may be used in accordance with ASCO guidelines. Immunotherapy, chemotherapy or radiation therapy not specified in this protocol Investigational agents other than MEDI4736 (durvalumab ). Live vaccines within 30 days pr ior to the first dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu - Mist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed. Glucocorticoids for any purpose other than the following two cl inical situations: o To control radiation -related nausea, if viewed as absolutely necessary for symptom control by the radiation oncologist. Every effort should be made to minimize glucocorticoid administration, e.g. utilization of appropriate alternative m edications including 5HT3, NK -1 antagonists, olanzapine etc. (note: no more than 4 mg decadron or 10 mg prednisone daily). o To modulate symptoms from an adverse event of suspected immunologic etiology. Note: The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids (e.g. 10 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent) may be approved after consultation with the Principal Investigator. o Patients who, in the assessment of the treating investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical manag ement should be removed from protocol treatment. Patients may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary. 5.3.3 Participation in Other Trials Patients are not to participate in other therapeutic trials. However, tri als that do not add experimental agents are allowed (e.g. imaging trials, quality of life, etc). 5.4 Duration of Therapy In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue as specified in the above treatment modality section s or until one of the following criteria NRG -LU004 38 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 of all 13 cycles of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) , Disease progression * Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, Unacceptable adverse event(s), as described in Section 6 Patient decides to withdraw consent for participation in the study, or General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. *At ti me of disease progression, patients will be managed per the discretion of the treating physician and will continue to be followed per the follow -up assessmen ts in Section 4 of the protocol . 6. TREATMENT MODIFICATIONS/ MANAGEMENT (13-JAN -2021 ) 6.1 -Related , Immune -Mediated, Infusion -Related, and for MEDI4736 (durvalumab) Radiation -Related Toxicities: Severe adverse events that may be related to radiation therapy during the cours e of radi ation such as any grade 3 cardiopulmonary SAEs heart failure, pneumonitis, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction), grade 4 esophagitis, or any AEs that lead to hospitalization that could be attributed to radiation therapy to make contin ued thera py inf easible should lead to the radiation therapy to be held. RT could be resumed if AEs return to grade 2 or less, but if the AEs do not return to grade 2 or less within 14 days, RT will be permanently discontinued. MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) Related-Toxi cities : For MEDI4736 (durvalumab) , there will not be any dose escalation or de -escalation. If the MEDI4736 (durvalumab) dose is held or interrupted it will not be made up. If RT is held or discontinued, MEDI4736 (durvalumab) may be continued as scheduled . If the patient meets retreatment criteria, the full dose of 1500 mg will be administered. If the patient does not meet retreatment criteria before the next scheduled dose, if/when the toxicity resolves to the point where treatment is possible, the doses of MEDI4736 ( durvalumab) are applied off schedule every 4 weeks. Adverse events (both non -serious and serious) associated with MEDI4736 ( durvalumab) exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These adverse events may occur shortly after the first d ose or several months after the last dose of treatment. MEDI4736 (durvalumab) must be withheld for drug -related toxicities and severe or life -threatening AEs as per the table below. All toxicities are per NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adver se Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 Guidelines for the management and dosing modifications for immun e-mediated reactions, infusion (durvalumab) provi ded in the subsections below as follows: General guidelines for toxicity management and dosing modifications ( Table 5a ) Toxicity managemen t and dosing modifications for immune -related adverse events (irAEs) -mediated AEs (imAEs) and dosing cations guidelines for Infusion -related reactions (Table 5c ) Toxicity management and dosing modifications guidelines for non -immune-mediated AEs (Table 5d ) Because immune -mediated events can occur in ne arly any organ or tissue, therefore, these guidelines may not include all the possible immune -mediated reactions. Investigators are advised to take into consideration the appropriate practice guidelines and ot her society gui delines (e.g., NCCN, ESMO) in t he management of these events. In case of doubt, the Investigator should consult with the Study Physician. Table 6a: General Guidelines for Toxicity Management and Dosing Modifications for Durvalumab General Considerati ons Regarding Immune -Mediated Re actions Early identification and management of immune -mediated adverse events (imAEs ) are essential to ensure safe use of the study drug. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune -mediated ad verse events. Patients with suspe cted imAEs should be thoroughly evaluated to rule o ut any alternative etiologies (e.g., disease progression, concomitant medications, infections). In the absence of a clear alternative etio logy, all such events should be managed as if they were immune -mediated. Institute medical management promptly, incl uding specialty consultation as appropriate. In general: o Withhold study drug/study regimen for severe (Grade 3) imAEs. o Permanently disco ntinue study drug/study regimen for life-threatening (Grade 4) im AEs, recurrent severe (Grade 3) imAEs that require systemic immunosuppressive treatment, or an inability to reduce corticosteroid dose to 10 mg or less of prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks of initiating co rticosteroids. Based on the sever ity of the imAE, durvalumab should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. Upon improvement to Grade 1, corticosteroid should be tapered over 28 days. More potent immunosuppressive agents such as TNF inhibitors (e.g., infliximab) should be consid ered f or events not responding to systemic steroids. Alternative immunosuppressive agents not listed in this guideline may be considered at the discretion of the investigator based on clinical practice and relevant guidelines. With long -term steroid and other immunosuppressive use, consider need for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP, formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) prophylaxis, gastrointestinal protection, and glucose monitoring. Because immune -mediated events can occur in nearly any organ or tissue, therefore, these guidelines may not include all the possible immune -mediated reactions. Investigators are advised to take into consideration the appropriate practice guidelines and other society guidelines (e.g., NCCN, ESMO) in the manage ment of these events. In case of doubt, the Investigator should consult with the Study Physician. All toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE, Version 5.0.

Once stable, gradually taper ste roids over 28 days. Peripheral neuromotor syndromes (such as Guillain - Barr\u00e9 and myasthenia gravis ) For Any Grade: The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes is important, since certain patients may unpredictably experience ac ute decompensations th at can resu lt in substantial morbidity or in the worst case, death. Special care should be taken for certain sentinel symptoms that may predict a more severe outcome, such as prominent dysphagia, rapidly progressive weakness, and sig ns of respiratory insu fficiency o r autonomic instability. Patients should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology ( e.g., disease progression, infections, NRG -LU004 Date: November 3, 2021 Table 6b: Durvalumab Dose Delays and Toxicity Management for imAEs Adverse Events Grade of the Event (NCI CTCAE v 5.0) Dose Modifications Toxicity Management metabolic syndromes or medications). It should be noted that the diagnosis of immune -mediat ed peripheral neuromot or syndrome s can be particularly challenging in patients with underlying cancer, due to the multiple potential confounding effects of cancer (and its treatments) throughout the neuraxis. Given the importance of prompt and accurate di agnosis, it is essenti al to have a low threshold to obtain a neurological consult. Neurophysiologic diagnostic testing ( e.g., electromyogram and nerve conduction investigations, and \"repetitive stimulation\" if myasthenia is suspected) are routinely indicat ed upon suspicion of s uch conditi ons and may be best facilitated by means of a neurology consultation. It is important to consider that the use of steroids as the primary treatment of Guillain -Barre is not typically considered effective. Patients requirin g treatment should be started wit h IV IG and followed by plasmapheresis if not responsive to IV IG. Grade 1 (Guillain -Barre [GB]: mild symptoms) (Myasthenia gravis [MG]: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; interventi on not indicated) No dose modif ications. For Grade 1: Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician. Care should be taken to monitor patients for sentinel symptoms of a potential decompensation as described above. Obtain a neurology consult . Grade 2 (GB: moderate symptom s; limiting ADL) (MG: moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age - appropriate instrumental ADL) Hold study drug/study regimen dose until resolution to Grade 1. Permanently discontinue study d rug/study regime n if it does not resolve to Grade 1 within 30 days or if there are signs of respiratory insufficiency or autonomic instability. For Grade 2: Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician. Care should be taken to monitor patie nts for sentinel symptoms of a potential decompensation as described above. Obtain a neurology consult Sensory neuropathy/neuropathic pain may be managed by app ropriate medications ( e.g., gabapentin or duloxetine). MYASTHENIA GRAVIS: o Steroids may be successfully used to t reat myasthenia gravis. It is important to consider that steroid therapy (especially with high doses) may result in transient worsening of myas thenia and should typically be administered in a monitored setting under supervision of a consulting neurologist . o Patients unable to tolerate steroids may be candidates for treatment with plasmapheresis or IV IG. Such decisions are best made in consultatio n with a neurologist, taking into account the unique needs of each patient. o If myasthenia gravis -like neurotoxic ity is present, consider starting AChE inhibitor therapy in addition to steroids.

Myocarditis General Guidance for Any Grade: The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated myoc arditis is importa nt, particularly in patients with baseline cardiopulmonary disease and reduced cardiac functio n. Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myocarditis (new onset or worsening chest pain, arrhyt hmia, shortness of breath, peripheral edema). As some symptoms can overlap with lung toxiciti es, simultaneously evaluate for and rule out pulmonary toxicity as well as other causes ( e.g., pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure, mal ignant pericardial effusion). A cardiology consultation should be obtained early, with prompt assessment of whe ther and when to complete a cardiac biopsy, including any other diagnostic procedures.

ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 7.1 Protocol Agents Investigational Agents The investigational agent administered in NRG -LU004, MEDI4736 (durvalumab) (NSC #778709), is being made available under an IND sponsored by CTEP. Refer to the MEDI4736 (durvalumab) investigator brochure (IB) for detailed pharmacologic and safety information. For MEDI4736 (durvalumab) , determination of whether an ad verse event meets expedited reporting crite ria, see the reporting table in section 7.4 of the protocol. 7.2 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 7.2.1 This study will utilize the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adv erse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 for reporti ng of adverse events (AEs), located on the CTEP web site, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electr onic_application s/ctc.htm . All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE vers ion 5.0. 7.2.2 Definition of an Adverse Event (AE) Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not cons idered drug rela ted. Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorab le and unintended sign (including an abnormal l aboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicina l (investigational) product (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or d efinite). (International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH], E2A, E6). For multi -modality trials, adverse event reporting encompasses all aspects of p rotocol treatmen t including radiation therapy, surgery, dev ice, and drug. Due to the risk of intrauterin e exposure of a fetus to potentially teratogenic agents, the pregnancy of a study participant must be reported via CTEP -AERS in an expedited manner. 7.3 Comprehe nsive Adverse Events and Potential Risks li st MEDI4736 (durvalumab, NSC 77870 9) (25-NOV -2019 ) The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by body system. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and italicized t ext. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list o f events that are NRG -LU004 58 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 protocol specific exception s to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below). Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' http://ctep.cancer.g ov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf for further clarification. Frequency is provided based on 2833 patients. Below is the CAEPR for MEDI4736 (durvalumab) . NOTE : Report AEs on t he SPEER ONLY IF they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to the AE in the SPEER. If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPE ERs, use the lower of the grades to determi ne if expedited reporting is required.

Your name, the n ame of the inves tigator, the protocol and the agent should be included in the e -mail. 2Immune -mediated adverse reactions (irAEs) have been reported in patients receiving MEDI4736 (durvalumab). irAEs can involve any of the organs or systems in the body. Most irAEs were reversible and managed with interruptions o f MEDI4736 (durvalumab), administration of co rticosteroids and supportive care, however, these events can be serious and fatal. 3Gastrointestinal perforations have been observed only in patients r eceiving (durvalumab) includes infe ction in the lungs, upper respiratory tract, dental and oral soft tissues and other organs under the INFECTIONS AND INFESTATIONS SOC. Infections genera lly are mild (Gr 1-2) but severe infections including sepsi s, necrotizing fasciitis, and osteomyelitis h ave been reported. 5Guillain -Barre Syndrome has been reported in patients receiving MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in combination with tremelimumab (CP includes the terms: erythematous, eczema. 7In rare cases, severe dermatitis has been report ed to manifest as Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal events reported on MEDI4736 (durvalumab) trials, but for whic h there is insuf ficient evidence to suggest that there was a reasonable possibility that MEDI4736 (durva lumab) caused the adverse event : BLOOD AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEM DISORDERS - Anemia; Disseminated Atrial ventricular dysfunction; Sinus tachycardia EAR AND LABYRINTH DISORDERS - Hearing impaired EYE DISO RDERS - Eye diso rders - Other shut down S - - Non-cardiac chest pain; Pain HEPATOBILIARY DISORDERS - Hepatic hemorrhage IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDERS - Immune system disorders - Other (drug -induced liver injury); Serum sickness INJURY, POISONING AND PROCEDURAL COMPLICATIONS - Wound complicatio n INVESTIGATIONS - Blood bilirubin White Rhabdomyolysis NEOPLASMS BENIGN, MALIGNANT AND UNSPECIFIED (INCL CYSTS AND POLYPS) - Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) - Other (brain gn, malignant and polyps) - Other (lung cyst); Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) - Other (tumor flare, tumor inflammation); Treatment r elated secondary malignancy; Tumor hemorrhage; Tumor pain NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS - Ataxia; Dizziness; Edema cerebral; Headache; Nervous system disorders - neuropathy); Nervous system disorders - Other (hemiparesis); Paresthesia; Seizure PSY CHIATRIC DISORDE RS - Confusion RENAL AND URINARY DISORDERS - Acute kidney injury RESPIRATORY, THORACIC ERS - Bullous de rmatitis; Dry skin DISORDERS - Hypertension NRG -LU004 63 ion Date: 3, 2021 Note : MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in com bination with other agents could cause an exacerbation of any adverse event currently known to be caused by the other agent, or the combination may result in events nev er previously associated with either agent. 7.4 Expedited Reporting of Adverse Event s (25-NOV -2019 ) All adverse events (AEs) are submitted for expedited reporting protocol -specific rules evaluation using the Medidata Rave data managemen t system. All AE s will be evaluated by the Cancer Therapy E valuation Program Adverse Event Reporting Sys tem (CTEP -AERS) to determine whether expedited reporting is recommended based on a set of programmed expedited reporting rules. AEs identified as meetin g the programmed expedited reporting requirements can then be submitted in CTEP -AERS. A deep link in Rav e will take the user directly to CTEP -AERS where the expedited report may be completed and submitted via CTEP -AERS. All serious adverse events that mee t expedited repo rting criteria defined in the reporting tab le below will be reported via the CTEP Advers e Event Reporting System, CTEP -AERS accessed via the link in RAVE. CTEP -AERS is also accessed via the CTEP web site, but all expedited reports must be initiated in RAV E (https://eapps - ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers/pages/task?rand=1390853489613 ). Submitting a report via -AERS serves as notification to the NRG Biostatist ical/Data Manage ment Center and satisfies NRG requirements for expedited adverse event reporting. CTE P-AERS provides a radiation therapy -only pathway for events experienced that involve radiation therapy only. These events must be reported via the CTEP -AERS radiation t herapy - only pathway. In the rare event whe n Internet connectivity is disrupted, a 24 -hour notification must be made to CTEP as the IND sponsor for this study by telephone at 301 -897-7497 and to the NRG Oncology by phone at 1 -215-574-3191. An electronic r eport must be submitted immediately upon re - establishment of the Internet connection. 7.4.1 Expedited Reporting Methods Per CTEP NCI Guidelines for Adverse Events Reporting, a CTEP -AERS 24 -hour notification must be submitted within 24 hour s of learning of the adverse event. Each CTEP -AERS 24 -hour notification must be followed by a complete r eport within 5 days. Supporting source documentation is requested by NRG as needed to complete adverse event review. Supporting source documentation sh ould include the protocol number, patient ID number, and CT EP-AERS ticket number on each page, and fax supporting documentation to CTEP at 301 -897-7404 and contact NRG Oncology at 1-215-574-3191 for source document submission assistance. In the event of si te assessment di sagreement with a CTEP -AERS rules assessmen t of an expedited report \"NOT recommended\", b ased upon the protocol -specific reporting requirements and criteria outlined in the AE Reporting Tables, sites may bypass the \"NOT recommended\" assessme nt; the CTEP -AER S allows submission of all reports regardle ss of the results of the assessment. NRG -LU004 64 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 7.4.2 Expedited Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events Phase 1 and Early Phase 2 Studies: Expedited Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events that Occur on Studies unde r an IND/IDE within 30 Days of the Last Adm inistration of the Investigational Agent/Int ervention 1, 2 FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312) NOTE: Investigators MUST immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adv erse Events, whether or not they are consid ered related to the investigational agent(s) /intervention (21 CFR 312.64) An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes: 1) Death 2) A life -threatening adverse e vent 3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitaliz ation or prolongation of existing hospitaliz ation for 24 hours 4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions 5) A congenital anom aly/birth defect . 6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or re quire hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; IC H E2A and ICH E6). ALL SERIOUS adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported to the NCI via AdEERS within the timeframes d etailed in the t able below. Hospitalization Grade 1 and Grade 2 Timeframes Grade 3 -5 Timeframes Resultin g in Hospitalization 24 hrs 10 Calendar Days 24-Hour 5 Calendar Days Not resulting in Hospitalization 24 hrs Not required NOTE: Protocol spe cific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found in the Specific Protocol Excep tions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR. Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as: o \"24-Hour; 5 Calendar - AE must i nitially be repo rted via AdEERS within 24 hours of learning of the AE, followed by a complete expedited re port within 5 calendar days of the initial 24 -hour report. o \"10 Calendar Days\" - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submitted within 10 cale ndar days of lea rning of the AE. 1Serious adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last admi nistration of investigational agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows: Expedited 2 4-hour notificat ion followed by complete report within 5 calendar days for: All Grade 3, 4, and Grade 5 AE s Expedited 10 calendar day reports for: Grade 2 AEs resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 2For studies using PET or SPECT I ND agents, the A E reporting period is limited to 10 radioactive half -lives, rounded UP to the nearest whol e day, after the agent/intervention was last administered. Footnote \"1\" above applies after this reporting period. Effective Date: May 5, 2011 Additional Protocol -Specific Instructions or Exceptions to Expedited Reporting Requirements NRG -LU004 65 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 Not applicable. 7.4.3 Reporting to the Site IRB/REB Investigators will report serious adverse events to the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Research Ethics Board (REB) resp onsible for oversight of the patient according to institutional policy. 7.4.4 Secondary M alignancy A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or che motherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur during or subsequent to treatment with an agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS . In addition, secondary malignancies following radiation therapy must be reported via CTEP -AERS. Three op tions are available to describe the event: Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Myelodysplastic syndro me (MDS) Treatme nt-related secondary malignancy Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (inclu ding AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol. Second Malignancy: A second malignancy is one unrelated to th e treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY routine AE reporting unless otherwise specified. 7.5 Pregnancy Although not an adverse event in and of itself, pregnancy as wel l as its outcome must be documented via CTEP -AERS . In addition, the Pregnancy Information Form included within the NCI Guidelines for Adverse Event Reporting Requirements must be completed and submitted to CTEP. Any pregnancy occurring in a patient or pa tient's partner from the time of consent to 3 months after the last dose of study drug mus t be reported and then followed for outcome. Newborn infants should be followed until 30 days old. Please see the \"NCI Guidelines for Investigators: Adverse Event R eporting Requirements IDEs\" (at ) for more details on how to report pregna ncy and its outcome to CTEP. 8.0 RE GISTRATION AND STUDY ENTRY PROCEDURES (03-AUG -2020) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and National Cancer Institute (NCI) policy require all individuals contributing to NCI -sponsored t rials to registe r and renew their registration annually.

NRG -LU004 73 Vers ion Date: November 3, of service: (240) 276 -6575 Monday through Friday between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm (ET) 9.1.2 Agent -Specific MAb Molecular Weight : ~ 149 kDa Mode of Action : Durvalumab (MEDI4736 ) inhibits binding of programmed cell to PD -1 Durvalumab (MEDI 4736 ) does not nt cellular cytotoxicity or complem ent-dependent cytotoxicity by AstraZeneca the Pharmaceutical Management Branch, CTEP/DCTD/NCI . Durvalumab (MEDI4736) injection is a clear to slightly opa lescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution for intravenous use. Each vial contains 500 mg of d urvalumab (MEDI4736) in 10 mL of solution . Each 1 mL of solution contains 50 mg of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and is formulated in: L-histidine (2 mg), L ne hydrochloride monohydrate (2.7 mg), , - trehalose dihydrate (104 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.2 Water for Injection, USP. Preparation: Durvalumab (MEDI4736 ) solution for infusion must be diluted prior to administration. To prepare the infusion solution add the dose volume of durvalumab (MEDI4736 ) to an infusion bag containing or Dextrose Water Injection , USP and mix by gentle inversion to ensure homogeneity of the dose in the bag. The final concentration must be between 1 mg/mL to 15 mg/mL . Infusion bags must be latex -free and can be made of polypropylene, polyethylene, polyolefin copolymers, or polyvinyl chloride. Storage: Store intact -8\u00b0C (36 -46\u00b0F). Do not freeze . Protect from light by storing in the original box . If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return durvalumab (MEDI4736 ) to between 2 -8\u00b0C and quarantine the supplies. Provide a detailed report of the excursion (including documentation of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursi on) to PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov for determination of suitability. Stability: Refer to the package label for expiration. Total in -use storage time from needle puncture of durva lumab (MEDI4736 ) vial to start of administration should not exceed 8 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2 -8\u00b0C (36-46\u00b0F). Prior to the start of the infusion, ensure that the bag contents are at r oom temperature (approximately 25\u00b0C) to avoid an infusi on reaction due to the administration of the solution at low temperatures. Route of Administration: IV infusion Method of Administration : Infuse over approximately 60 minutes using an infusion set containing a 0.22 or 0.2 m in -line filter. No incompatibilities between durvalumab (MEDI4736 ) and polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, or polyolefin copolymers have been observed. Flush the IV line with a volume of IV bag diluent equal to the priming volu me of the infusion set used at the complet ion of infusion . Do not co - administer o ther drugs through the same infusion line.

The PD -L1 protein is expressed on the plasma membrane of a range of he matopoietic and solid tissue cells interacting with the PD -1 receptor present on the surface of T - and B -lymphocytes and some myeloid cells. PD -L1/PD -1 binding triggers signal transduction cascades that results in self -tolerance and immune system suppressi on normally acting as an immune checkpoint that prevents overstimulation and autoimmunity. Upregulation of PD -1 expression is often present on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and correspondingly, enhanced PD -L1 expression ca n be found on many tumor cells. B lockade of PD -L1 stimulation of PD -1 impedes immune inhibition and allows for recognition of tumor as non -self, resulting in tumor cytotoxicity. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that PD -L1 status may be predictive of benefit from treatment with ch eckpoint inhibitors. Durval umab is -1 with increased PD -L1 expression. Tumors with high expression of PD -L1 show increased objective response rate and improved progression free a nd overall survival compared to l ow Anti -PD-L1, Clone 22C3 intended for use in in formalin tissue and gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma using EnVision FLEX visualization and performed on Autostainer Link 48. PD -L1 IHC 22C3 is indicated as an aid in NSCLC patients for treatment with pembroli zumab. PD -L1 protein expression in NSCLC is determined by using Tumor Proportion Score (TPS), which is the percentage of viable tumor cells showing partial or complete membrane staining at any intensity. The specimen is considered to have PD -L1 expression if if TPS 50%. Mandatory Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) at Liquid Biotech : Blood will be shipped directly to Liquid Biotech USA for testing.

DATA AND RECORDS 13.1 Data Management/Collection (03-AUG -2020 ) Medidata Rave is a clinical data management system being used for dat a collection for this trial/study. Access to the trial in Rave is controlled through the CTEP -IAM system and role assignments. Requirements t o access Rave via iMedidata: NRG -LU004 81 CTEP -IAM account; and Assigned a Rave role on the LPO or PO roster at the e nrolling site of: CRA, Rave CRA or Rave CRA (Lab Admin) role must have a minimum of an Associate Plus ( AP) registration type; o Rave Investigator role must be registered as an Non-Physician Investigator (NPIVR ) or Investigator ( IVR); and o Rave Read Only role must hold an Associates (A) registration type. Refer to https://ctep.cancer.gov/investig atorResources/default.htm for registration types and documentation r equired. Upon initial site registration approval for the study in RSS, all persons with Rave roles assigned on the appropriate roster will be sent a study invitation e -mail from iMedidata . To accept the invitation, site staff must log into the Select Logi n (https://login.imedidata.com/selectlogin) using their CTEP -IAM user name and password, and click on the \"accept\" link in the upper right -corner of the iMedidata page. Please note, site staff will not be able to access the study in Rave until all required Medidata and study specific trainings are completed. Trainings will be in the form of el ectronic learnings (eLearnings) and will be listed in the upper right pane of the iMedidata screen. If an eLearning is required and has not yet been taken, the link t o the eLearning will appear under the study name in iMedidata instead of the Rave EDC lin k; once the successful completion of the eLearning has been recorded, access to the study in Rave w ill be granted, and a Rave EDC link will display under the study nam e. Site staff that have not previously activated their iMedidata/Rave accounts at the t ime of initial site registration approval for the study in RSS will receive a separate invitation from iMedidata to activate their account. Account activation instruct ions are located on the CTSU website in the Data Management section under the Rave resour ce materials (Medidata Account Activation and Study Invitation Acceptance). Additional information on iMedidata/Rave is available on the CTSU website under the Rave ta b at www.ctsu.org/RAVE/ or by contacting the CTSU Help Desk at 1 -888-823-5923 or by e - mail at Cancer Evaluation Program Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP - AERS) integration enables evaluation of post -baseli ne Adverse Events (AE) entered in Rave to determine whether they require expedited reporting, and f acilitates entry in CTEP -AERS for those AEs requiring expedited repo rting. All AEs that occur after baseline are collected in Medidata Rave using the Adv erse Event form, which is available for entry at each treatment or reporting period, and used to co llect AEs that start during the period or persist from the previous reporting period. CRA will enter AEs that occur prior to the start of treatment on a base line form that is not included in the Rave -CTEP -AERS integration. AEs that occur prior to enrollmen t must begin and NRG -LU004 82 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 end on the baseline Adverse Events form and should not be included on the standard Adverse Events form that is available at treatment unless there has been an increase in grade. Prior to sending AEs through the rules evaluation process, s ite staff should verify the following on the Adverse Event form in R ave: The reporting period (course/cycle) is correct; and AEs are recorded and complete (n o missing fields) and the form is query free. The CRA reports AEs in Rave at the time the Investig ator learns of the event. If the CRA modifies an AE, it must be re -submitted for rules evaluation. Upon completion of AE entry in Medidata Rave, the CRA sub mits the AE for rules evaluation by completing the Expedited Reporting Evaluation form. Both NCI an d protocol -specific reporting rules evaluate the AEs submitted for e xpedited reporting. A report is initiated in CTEP -AERS using information entered in Medid ata Rave for AEs that meet reporting requirements. The CRA completes the report by accessing CTEP - AERS via a direct link on the Medidata Rave Expedited Reporting Evalu ation form. In the rare occurrence, that Internet connectivity is lost , a 24-hour notifi cation is to be made to CTEP by telephone at 301 -897-7497. Once internet connectivity is restored, the 24-hour notification that was phoned in must be entered immediat ely into CTEP -AERS using the direct link from Medidata Rave. Additional information abou t the CTEP -AERS integration is available on the CTSU website: Study specific documents: Protocols > Documents> Education and Promotion; and Expedited Safety Reportin g Rules Evaluation user guide: Resources > CTSU Operations Information> User Guides & Hel p Topics . NCI requirements for SAE reporting are available on the CTEP website: NCI Gui delines for Investigators: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements is a vailable at https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/ aeguidelines .pdf. 13.3 Data Quality Portal (03-AUG -2020 ) The Data Quality Port al (DQP) provides a central location for site staff to manage unanswered queries and form delinquencies, monitor data quality and timeliness, generate reports, and review metrics. The DQ P is located on the CTSU members' website under Data Management. The Rave Home section displays a table providing summary counts of Total Delinquencies and T otal Queries. DQP Queries, DQP Delinquent Forms and the DQP Reports modules are available to access details and reports of unanswered queries, delinquent forms, and timeliness reports. Review the DQP modules on a regular basis to manage specified queries a nd delinquent forms. NRG -LU004 83 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 The DQP is accessible by site staff that are rostered to a site and have acce ss to the CTSU website. Staff that have Rave study access can access the Rave study data using a direct link on the DQP. To learn more about DQP use and acc ess, click on the Help icon displayed on the Rave Home, DQP Queries, and DQP Delinquent Forms mod ules. Note: Some Rave protocols may not have delinquent form detail s or reports specified on the DQP. A protocol must have the Calendar functionality implem ented in Rave by the Lead Protocol Organization for delinquent form details and reports to be avail able on the DQP. Site staff should contact the LPO Data Manager for their protocol regarding questions about Rave Calendaring functionality . 13.4 Summar y of Data Submission (25-NOV -2019 ) Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of pa tients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during the trial using Medidata Rave\u00ae. Additionally, certain adverse events must be r eported in an expedited manner for more timely monitoring of patient safety and care. Se e Section 7.4 for information about expedited and routine reporting. Summa ry of All Data Submission: Refer to the protocol specific page on the NRG website (www.nrgoncology.org).

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 14.1 Study Design This is a ph ase I tri al to assess the safety and feasibility of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) and RT that is split into 2 parts. In the initial safety part, 6 patients will enroll to the ACRT + MEDI4736 (durvalumab) arm, with a mandatory toxicity evaluation period of 90 days from the start of radiation therapy. After the first 6 patients are enrolled onto the ACRT, 6 patien ts will be enrolled to the standard radiation + MEDI4736 (durvalumab) arm w ith a mandatory toxicity evaluation of 8 weeks from the start of radiation ther apy. Onc e all patients have been assessed for toxicity, the expansion part of this study will enroll 6 patie nts each to the arm(s) that is/are deemed safe. If both arms are de emed safe, then a total of 12 patients will be randomized to receive ACRT + MED I4736 (du rvalumab) or standard radiation + MEDI4736 (durvalumab). If only one of the two arms is dee med safe, then only that arm will enroll 6 additional patients. If neither arm is deemed safe, then the study will not continue onto the expansion part. 14.2 Study Endpoints 14.2.1 Primary endpoint : Safety of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in with RT Secondary endpoints Feasibility of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in combin ation with RT Adverse events, as measured by CTCAE v 5.0 Progression free survi val, acco rding to RECIST guidelines 14.2.3 Exploratory endpoints Progression free survival, according to irR C guidelines CTC and immune parameter changes during treatment 14.3 Primary Objectives Study Design (03-AUG -2020 ) 14.3.1 Primary Hypothesis and E ndpoints The primary hypothesis is that MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in combination with two schedules of ra diation therapies (60 Gy in 30 fractions or 60 Gy in 15 fractions) is safe. 14.3.2 How Primary Endpoints Will Be Analyzed The tolerability of this regime n is defi ned as having one or no safety events defined as: 1) grade 4 -5 non -hematologic serious adver se even ts (SAEs) as defined in Section 7.4.2 possibly, probably or definitely related to protocol treatment by 90 days from the start of concurrent therapy (start of RT) for the ACRT + MEDI4736 (durvalumab) arm and 8 weeks from th e start of concurrent therapy (start of RT) for the standard radiation + MEDI4736 (durvalumab) arm; 2) any adverse events possibly, probably or definitel y related to protocol treatment that lead to prolonged dose delays (defined as skipping at least 2 dos es of M EDI4736 (durvalumab) during the same monitoring period for each arm) ; 3) permanent discontinuation of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) due to toxicity possib ly, proba bly or definitely related to protocol treatment within the first 30 days of starting MEDI4736 (durva lumab) ; or NRG November 3, 2021 4) SAEs possibly, probably or definitely related to RT ( including grade 3 -4 congestive heart failure, pneumonitis, arrhythmias, and myo cardial i nfarction, grade 4 esophagitis, and any AEs that lead to hospitalization) that causes either an inte rruption or early termination of RT as specified in Section 6.1 . The proportion of patients who have tolerated the tr eatment w ill be provided. All adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v 5.0. All DLTs will be adju dicated by the study PI and either the disease site chair or a study chair in terms of attribution to protocol treatment and whether the event meet s the def inition of a DLT. If the adjudicators are not in agreement, a third adjudicator will be brou ght in to review the DLT. 14.3.3 Sample Size and Power Calculations Evaluable patients must be eligible at the time of study registration and have star ted proto col treatment. If a patient dies or withdraws consent from the study within the safety monit oring p eriod without experiencing a safety event that patient will be repla ced. Each arm will enroll a maximum of 12 evaluable patients for assessment of tolerabi lity. In the first part of the study for either arm, if 0 -1 of 6 evaluable patients develop any of the safety events after completing RT, then the regimen will be deem ed safe and that arm will continue to the second part of the study and enroll 6 addition al evaluable patients. However, if 2 or more of 6 evaluable patients develop any safety even ts, tha t arm is considered not safe and will not be pursued in the second p art. With a cohort of 6 patients, the probability of the treatment being judge d to be t oo toxic when the true toxicity rate is 4 0% or higher is at least 7 7%. If the true toxicity r ate is 18% or lower, the probability that the treatment will be deemed to b e safe is at least 70 %. If 4 or more of the 12 evaluable patients on an arm experienc e a safety event, the treatment will be considered not tolerable. If 4 patients experience a safety event prior to reaching the target sample size of 12 patients, accr ual to that cohort will be closed. If 3 patients experience a safety event onc e 9 patie nts have been enrolled but prior to reaching 12 patients, accrual will be suspended to monito r the remaining patients still in the safety assessment window for whom a s afety event has not been reported. Accrual to that cohort will only be reopene d if no a dditional patients have experienced a safety event. The other cohort will remain open to a ccrual, if applicable, during this time. If fewer than 4 of the 12 evalua ble patients on an arm experience a safety event, then the treatment will be co nsidered tolerable. With a cohort of 12 patients, the probability of the treatment being judged to be too to xic when the true toxicity rate is 4 0% or higher is at least 78%. If the true toxicity rate is 18% or lower, the probability that the treatment will be deem ed to be safe is 8 5%. In order to proceed to a phase II trial, the treatment(s) must be cons idered both safe (as defined above) and feasible (as defined in Section 14.6.2 ). 14.4 Study Monitoring of Primary Objectives Interim An alysis to Monitor Study Progress Interim reports will be prepared twice each year until the f inal an alysis has been accepted for presentation or publication. In general , these reports will contain information about NRG -LU004 86 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 the accrual rate with projected completio n date for the accrual phase, exclusion rates, pretreatment characteristics of patients accru ed, and the frequency and severity of AEs. This study will be monitored b y the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS) Version 3.0. Cumulative protocol - and patient -specific CDUS data will be submitted electronically to CTEP on a quarterly basis by FTP burst of dat a. Reports are due January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31. Instructions for submitting data using the CDUS can be found on the CTEP websit e (http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/cdus.ht ml). After the start of the accrual, the study team, including the study chairs, study statisticians, data managers and protocol administrator, and a re presentat ive from each participating site will hold at least monthly conference calls to review the ov erall c onduct of the study lead by the study statistician. Data on treatmen t dose delivery, adverse events reported, patient demographics and eligibility will be a ssembled and reviewed. At each meeting, consideration is also given to the rate of accrual. Brief m inutes of each meeting will be written by the study chairs to docume nt the review of information and any decision made. The meeting minutes will be submitte d to the NRG early phase protocol monitoring oversight committee for review. If one or both arms ar e to move forward to the expansion cohort based on the criteria stated in Section 14.3.3 , a review of the da ta with the study team and CTEP will take place. 14.5 Accrual/Study Duration Considerations Accrual is expected to be 4 patients/month after a 3 month initial ramp -up period. Initial Safety Schedules (enrollment of 6 patients/arm) is expected to close af ter 6 months. Expansion Cohorts will open, assuming ACRT + MEDI4736 (durvalumab) is shown to be saf e and feasible, approximately 4 -6 months after closing Initial Safet y Schedules (to allow for 8 -16 weeks of follow -up to assess prolonged dose dela ys as wel l as time for data collection and analysis). It is projected to take 4 months to accrue to R andomiz ation stage ( 1 month ramp -up period and 3 months accruing 4 patients /month). This stage will similarly require 8 -16 weeks of follow -up to assess p rolonged dose delays. The primary analysis is projected to occur approximately 20 months from study a ctivati on. 14.6 Secondary Endpoints 14.6.1 Secondary Hypotheses and E ndpoints : MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in combination with RT is feasible Adverse eve nts, as m easured by CTCAE v 5.0 Progression free survival 14.6.2 Definitions of Secondary Endpoints a nd How These Will Be Analyzed Feasibility Feasibility is based on an evalua tion of the percentage of patients who received at least 80% of the planned dos e of MEDI 4736 (durvalumab) therapy during the first 8 weeks following initial dose of MEDI4736 (durval umab) . Feasibility will only be assessed -LU004 87 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 the treatment cohort(s) that m oves to the expansion phase. The observation of at least 80% (10/12 per arm) of patients who received at least 80% of the planned dose is considered to be evidence that this regimen is fea sible in this setting. Adverse events Adverse events (AE) will be evaluated using the CTCAE v 5.0. Counts of all AEs by grade will be provided by treatm ent arm. Counts and frequencies will be provided for the worst grade AE experienced by the p atient by treatment arm and within the subset of AEs related to treatment. Severe AEs will be any grade 4 or greater non -hematologic toxicities and will be summar ized by frequency tables by treatment arm. No formal statistical testing will be performed o n these summary data. Progression Free Survival Tumor response will be ass essed by the RECIST guidelines (as reported by the sites) as defined in Section 4 . Progression free survival (PFS), defined as the time from registration to progre ssive disease or death, whichever occurs first, will be estimated using the Kaplan Meier method. Plots and descriptive statistics will be provided for both treatment arms but no formal testing performed due to lack of statistical power. 14.6.3 Explorat ory Hypothes es and Endpoints Progression Free Survival Tumor measure ments will be collected at baseline, the end of treatment and throughout follow -up in or der to determine response using the irRC guidelines. Progression free survival (PFS), define d as the time from registration to progressive disease or death, whichever occurs first, will be estimated using the Kaplan Meier method. Plots and descr iptive st atistics will be provided for both treatment arms but no formal testing performed due to lack of sta tistical power. Biomarker Analysis Biomarker analyses will be c onducted for feasibility purposes. There is not sufficient power to detect dif ferences between arms or any prognostic ability of the biomarkers described. Therefore all biomarker analyse s, including the immune parameters described in Section 10. 4.1, will focus on descriptive statistics and change from baseline to subsequent collect ion times . Circulating tumor cells will be collected and analyzed at the time of progression. It is hypothe sized that progress ed patients will have a value of green fluorescen t proton -expressing cells per ML > 1.3 (Frick 2018, Dorsey 2015). Therefore, at 2 years , an analysis will be conducted to determine if every progressed patient has a value > 1.3. 14.6.4 Gender/Ethnicity/Race Distribution There will not be sufficient sample sizes to conduct any subgroup analyses based on race, ethnicity, and/or gender.

RATIONALE The purpose of this document is to describe the procedure for handling, packaging, and shipping blood samples from study part icipants, by ensuring safe and timely delivery to Liquid Biotech USA. 1. Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) A. Overview Currently, there is little known about the numbers, time course, and effect of therapy on Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) in NSCLC patients. The bi ospecimens collected in this study will allow for an assessment of (1) CTC changes during treatment with durvalumab and radiotherapy and after completion of treatment , and (2) the relationship between CTC changes during and following treatment with radiogr aphic tumor response and disease recurrence. CTCs will be enriched from whole blood and treated with TelomeScan (OBP -401). TelomeScan is a genetically engineered adenovirus that replicates and produces GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) specifically in live, cancerous cells with high TERT expression. GFP expressing cells will be imaged and enumerated. The disappearance of CTCs / mL is an indication of disease clearance, and the reappearance of CTCs / mL is an indication of progressive disease or recurrence. B. Laboratory Testing Procedures Blood specimens are required for this analysis. The procedure of blood collection for each patient will be as follows: Blood will be drawn into a waste tube (to avoid collecting skin material and potential contaminating skin st em cells) . The waste tube will either be discarded or used to investigate other laboratory methods involving CTC virus transduction . Subsequently, blood will be collected in ACD -A tubes at ambient temperature and placed in a n insulated tube box inside a biohazard plastic bag and transported to the laboratory for processing. II. MATERIALS No. Product Quantity 1 TelomeScan corrugated shipping box 1 2 Biohazard Specimen Transport Bag 1 3 Absorbent pad 1 4 Gel pack (Phase 22 Cryopak) 2 5 List of conten ts card 1 6 Barcoded BD Vacutainer Blood Collection Tube with ACD -A (8.5mL) 3 7 Insulated tube holder box 1 8 Commercial Grade Packaging tape 1 (supplied as needed per site) III. PROCEDURE SHIPMENT PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS NRG -LU004 100 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 1. All necessary materials fo r shipping (including blood collection tubes and 2 gel pack s for internal temperature control ) may be obtained from Liquid Biotech USA. Please contact Liquid Biotech USA at support @liquidbiotechusa.com (tel: 267-225-7361 ) to arrange for delivery of materia ls. Prior to blood collection, it is recommended for patient visit dates to be logged by going to www.liquidbiotechusa.com and clicking the \"Schedule\" button on the main page. 2. Using the barcoded blood col lection tubes with Acid -Citrate -Dextrose Solution A (ACD - A), completely collect whole blood. It is critical that tubes are inverted 8 -10 times immediately following collection of each tube. The first 5 mL of the blood draw should be drawn in a discard tube to avoid skin cell contamination. Extra ACD -A tubes are supplied which may be used for the initial 5mL discard. Only 1 completely filled tube is required for testing. Each tube should be filled with 8.5mL of blood to completely fill the tube. I t is neces sary to ship samples on the same day as the blood draw . Samples should be stored at ambient temperature until shipped. NOTE : Liquid Biotech USA is NOT able to accept deliveries on a weekend or major US holiday. Please do NOT draw blood on a Friday or the 2 days prior to a major US holiday, as the sample will not be received in a timely manner. If the patient can only be seen on one of these days, please coordinate special transportation needs with Liquid Biotech USA . 3. Barcoded t ubes should be clearly label ed to include date and time of blood draw. NOTE: Sites may include a unique identifier number document ation purposes. 4. Place filled tube(s) in the insulated tube holder and place inside a Biohazard Specimen Transport Bag with absorbent material. NRG -LU004 101 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 5. Place the tube holder in bag between the 2 gel packs that are supplied with the kit. These gel packs change phase between solid and liquid at 72\u00b0F. When shipping during the colder seasons (external low temperature <32\u00b0F), it is recommended to ship packs in the liquid state. When shipping during the warmer seasons (external high temperature >86\u00b0F) it is recommended to ship packs in the solid state. 6. Fill out the itemized list of contents card and place on top of the Styrofoam box. The card should have checked Di agnostic Specimens, Glass and/or Plastic tubes, Tube Separator Bag(s), Secondary and Absorbent Pad(s). Optionally, the \"Requisition\" and \"Instruction Sheet\" should be checked if included. 7. Seal the corrugated box with packagi ng tape across the front flap . NRG -LU004 102 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 8. Samples should be shipped at ambient temperature the same day they are collected . 9. Kits are pre -labeled with FedEx shipping information. Ship the package at ambient temperature by contacting FedEx for pick -up at 1-800-463-3339. NOTE: It is critical that samples are shipped the same day as blood collection (using FedEx overnight), so that they may be processed within approximately 24 hours of the blood draw. Samples that are not received by Liquid Biotech USA on the d ay following blood collection will not be processed. IV. HEALTH AND SAFETY 1. Standard safety precautions are to be followed. Always wear gloves when handling blood samples. 2. Refer to the risk assessment, hazard data sheets, and Departmental policy at your location for additional safety information. V. PERSONNEL Appropriate staff for sample packaging preparation and shipment may include all trusted and responsible institution lab personnel qualified to handle blood samples. VI. Packaging and shipment che cklist of clinical specimens Check or Initial Item/Activity All primary receptacles (i.e., specimen collection containers) have positive closures, such as conventional caps. Each primary receptacle is labeled with the date/time the sample was collected , and optionally a unique identifier . For liquid specimens, the primary receptacle is leak -proof and contains a maximum of 10 ml . When shipped by air, the primary or secondary containers are able to withstand, without leakage, an internal pressure prod ucing a pressure differential of not less than 95kPa (14 psi) in the range of -40\u00b0C to 55\u00b0C ( -40\u00b0F to 130\u00b0F) . The primary receptacles are individually wrapped or separated and placed inside a NRG -LU004 103 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 leak-proof secondary container . The secondary container is c ertified by the manufacturer prior to use. Absorbent material has been placed between the primary receptacle and the secondary container (enough absorbent material to absorb the entire contents of all the primary receptacles) .

Include all required specimen paperwork in pocket o f biohazard bag. 2. Check that the Specimen Transmittal (ST) Form has been completely filled out. Use NRG labels for the top box (Study & Case) . 3. Only send samples that have a case # assigned. If the patient does not have a case number it means they are not registered yet. Contact NRG Oncology data managers with que stions regarding registration. 4. Check that all samples are labeled with the NRG Study, case number, and date of procedure. 5. FFPE Specimens for Banking: H&E Slide of primary tumor (can be duplicate cut slide, does not have to be diagnostic slide) . FFPE Ti ssue Block of primary tumor (must be same block as H&E slide being submitted) . If an FNA was done we cannot accept FNA slides unless there is an FFPE cell block with tumor cells available. Sites ar e to submit one FNA H&E and matching FNA FFPE cell block if sufficient tumor cells are available. If there are insufficient cells then note this on the ST form with the H&E being submitted. For sites unable to submit the complete tumor tissue block then th en the following alternative is acceptable: Either: o Two un stained slides with date cut on the slides. o OR Two 2mm (or 3mm) punches (tumor size dependent) embedded in paraffin with a corresponding H&E. (Punch kits available from NRGBB -SF upon request). If sites are unable to embed the punches they may send the pun ches to the biobank to be embedded. NRG -LU004 106 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 o If sites are unable to provide punches due to limited amounts of tissue, then TWO freshly cut 5 micron u nstained slides are an acceptable alternative in such ca ses. Sites must label the unstained slides with Study, Case #, accession number, block number and date the slides were cut. Slides must be shipped to NRGBB -SF within 2 business days from when they were cut . Please make sure all FFPE specimens are labeled with Study#, Case#, Specimen accession number and block ID. Redact or cover up the patient name if present. Do not add paper sticky labels over this information. It is the Biospecimen Banks SOP to remove all sticky labels on slides before adding an NRGBB l abel. All FFPE submission must include the H&E slide that matches the samples. We cannot accept FFPE submissions without the H&E slide. If submitting embedded punches, an H&E from the punch block must be included along with the original block H&E with th e area punched marked on the original H&E. If patients co nsent to banking DO NOT ship us FFPE specimens with a return request. We cannot accept or bank samples that we cannot keep. Always send what can be banked (duplicate H&Es, Blocks or punches). We ca n punch and return blocks if noted in the protocol. You may indicate that you want us to punch and return the block on the ST form and you can include a return request form and return airbill with the submission. Punch kits can be requested from us by emai l (NRGBB@ucsf.edu) if sites wish to punch the block themsel ves. Slides should be shipped in plastic slide holder/slide box. Place a small wad of padding in top of the container. If you can hear slides shaking it is likely that they will break during shipp ing. DO NOT ship slides in cardboard slide flats or single unit plastic slide holders. FFPE Blocks can be shipped in a plastic block holder or wrapped with paper or placed in a paper envelope, and placed in a cardboard box with padding. Do not wrap block s with bubble wrap or gauze. Place padding in top of contai ner so that if you shake the container the blocks are not shaking. If you can hear blocks shaking they may break during shipping. During warm weather months the use of cold packs is highly recommen ded to prevent wax from melting. Slides, Blocks, or Plugs can be shipped ambient or with a cold pack either by United States Postal Service (USPS) to the USPS address (94143) or by Courier to the Street Address (94115).

Overview Assess ment of changes in immune cell diversity over time is required to quantify t he immun e cell subsets in circulation , with each subset given in perc entages rather than absolute amount or levels. The dynamic changes in immune cell subsets throughout therapy may tell us whether specific subsets of T cells are being expanded, such as memory T c ells or activated T cells. We hypothesize that expansion of s pecific subsets of cells will correlate most strongly with the disease outcomes of patients. The immune cell subsets that change with the different radiation schedules with immunotherapy could al so relate to enhanced toxicities, which will be monitor ed very closely as the primary endpoint of this phase I study. B. Laboratory Testing Procedures Assessing multiple cell types simultaneously in a high dimensional manner requires multiparametric t echnolog y that could simultaneously assess all of th e parameters on a single cell. Using Time of Flight Mass Cytometry (CyTOF), antibodies conjugated with rare transition element isotopes that differ by one atomic number could be quantified and distinguish ed using a TOF mass cytometer. The theoretical maximum of parameters is 100, but the most common use s have only interrogated up to 34 surface or intracellular proteins. This already greatly exceeds the capability of standard fluorescence -based flow cytomet ry. Usin g MatLab analysis, e.g., CD8, CD4, Treg, MDSC, NK, B cells) and expression level s of various activating, inhibitory, or signaling molecules on these cells. 2. TC R Sequencing A. Overview Lymphocyte maturation is a pr ocess ma rked by immunophenotypic changes, as well as discrete and reg ulated molecular events. The first event in the process of antitumor cytotoxic T -cell response is antigen capture by antigen -presenting cells (APCs). The antigens are processed and subseq uently p resented on HLA class I molecules to CD8+ T cells to activate the T -cell response against these specific antigens. Following activation, effector CD8+ T cells infiltrate into tumor tissues, releasing cytotoxic agent upon recognition of cancer cells through the interaction between TCR and its cognate antigen bound to HLA class I. The diversity of T cells is determined by their TCR. The complimentary determi ning region 3 (CDR3) of the TCR chain is the most variable portion of the TCR and is critical for MHC -peptide complex recognition. The range of individual TCR -bearing T -cell clones that comprises the repertoire specific for a particular antigenic MHC -peptide com - plex varies substantially in terms of TCR frequency and diversity. A consequence of th is speci ficity is that the TCR CDR3 sequence can be used as a \"molecu lar tag\" to identify each T -cell clone. Recently presented data have indicated that that large clonal T -cell expansions were associated with inferior PFS and in -cell lymphoma B. Labor atory Tes ting Procedures CIMAC will designate a laboratory to perform TCR sequencing .* *Note: at CIMAC discretion, if sufficient material is available. 3. Cyt okine Analysis A. Overview This e xploratory analysis will identify the quantity and types of cyt okines re leased in the blood during and after therapy. Cytokines and c hemokines mediate the cross talk between cells of the immune system, both locally and systemically. Certain inflammatory mediators such as interferons act as surrogates of the activation of the i mmune system, and also signal the effectiveness of cancer the rapy. Certain markers are also immunosuppressive (e.g., TGF beta), so the effectiveness of the immune system response is a balance of immunostimulating and immunosuppressive cytokines. Ra diation t herapy could also illicit profound cytokine release and the a mount could have relationship to both the radiation dose and fractionation schemes, and the synergistic interaction with immunotherapy. We proinflammatory cytokines coul d be rele ase differentially depending on the radiation schedule, which could further be accentuated by immunotherapy. Inflammatory mediators could also contribute to immune related adverse events that may be exacerbated by radiation therapy . Therefore , we may also see early surrogates of toxicity by monitoring dynamic altera tions of cytokine levels. B. Laboratory Testing Procedures Multiplex Immunoassay using the OLink Technology. Plasma (prepared from blood collected in green -top sodium -heparin tubes) will be collecte d and sent to the NRGBB - Columbus for processing, then sent to the CIMAC laboratory at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York to conduct the OLink assay . Samples will be collected at baseline, Day 15 and 30 post treatment, and at 3 months from the start of durvalumab (i.e. cycle 4). Olink assay has large dynamic range and each assay has internal controls that will ensure the robustness of the test. 4. ELISA/Grand Serology A. Overview B. One approach to test whether tumors become more immunoge nic as a result of immunotherapy is to measure naturally occu rring antibodies in patient serum or plasma. Autologous serotyping has resulted in a growing list of immunogenic human cancer antigens1, including mutational, thou gh usually intracellular, reflect the immune system's capacity to detect abnormalities associated with neoplasia. The presence of antibodies to tumor antigens can be used as a marker of tumor pre sence or progression, but may also help generate T cell respo nses via immune complexes with cognate antigen. In some cases, such as the cancer/testis antigen NY -ESO -1, serum antibodies are associated with spontaneous T cell responses in peripheral blood. W e propose to test the hypotheses that immunotherapy leads to induction or increase in immunity to locally expressed antigens by assessing serological changes pre -post treatment, and that the serological repertoire in patients may be useful as a pr ognostic or predictive tool. Laboratory Testing Procedures NRG -LU004 116 Vers ion Date: November 3, 2021 Using serol ogical markers as a surrogate for presence of antitumor immunity is proposed as a quick and affordable way to assess tumor immunocompetence and response. A series of known tumor antigens will be assessed in a hypothesis -driven manner for their capacity to elicit autoantibodies in treated patients. Using ELISA, we will test a set of 25 tumor antigens, including mutational, stem -cell, which already have demonstra ted immunogenicity in various solid and hematologic tumors. Grand Serology is also ideally suited to test for potential for antigen spreading, i.e., development of seroreactivity to anti gens unre lated to immunogen es, which is a useful measurement to assess in immunotherapy. 5. Ci rculating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) A. Overview The detectability of any strand of DNA bearing cancer specific mutations can be quantified as well as the number of molecu les per m L of blood. Any molecule of cancer specific DNA (or ctDNA) ca n be determined as minimal residual disease, and the disappearance of the ctDNA in the blood is an indication of disease clearance. The level may also indicate disease burden as well. B. Laboratory Testing Procedures Ultradeep allelic sequencing of ctDNA - to be performed CIMAC laboratory . 6. PD-L1 (SP263) expression of PD -L1 on tumor and im mune cells in the tumor microenvironment impedes anti -tumor i mmunity, allowing tumors to grow and metastasize. SP263 tumor cell staining quickly calculates PD-L1 positivity for user -defined regions of interest. b. Laboratory Testing Procedures PD-L1 (SP263) IHC will be done using optional tissue biospecimens for cases that were stained using the D ako 22C3 (the Dako 22C3 will be used in "}
