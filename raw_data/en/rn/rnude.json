Shermer then discusses the free speech issues and why Holocaust denial is primarily an American phenomenon (where it is not illegal as in most other countries), and what it is that Holocaust deniers are denying. He then closes with a dramatic reading from the Scopes Monkey Trial, quoting Clarence Darrow on the importance of freedom of speech, even and especially for points of view that we find distasteful.

O'Reilly reviews [Annals of Gullibility: Why We Get Duped and How to Avoid it](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0313362165?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0313362165) by Stephen Greenspan. Mike O'Reilly is a writer and business owner living in Salt Lake City. Originally from the Detroit area, he moved west in 2004 with his wife to attend the University of Utah, where he earned his masters degree in poetry. His first book, Mysteries and Legends of Utah, was published by Globe Pequot Press, in April. He is currently writing a book about hunting ethics, animal rights, and environmentalism. GULLIBILITY The Gullible Instructing the Gullible a book review by Michael E. O'Reilly If you skim through the online reviews of Stephen Greenspan's book on gullibility you will find many people eager to pounce on Greenspan for his being swindled by Bernie Madoff (which he discusses in his Skeptic article in [Vol. 14, No. 4](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/magv14n4) and in [eSkeptic](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/08-12-23#feature)), proclaiming that there's no way they'd take advice about gullibility from a person so gullible. Of course, the fact that a psychology professor who specializes in gullibility has fallen for a major scam is the very reason one should read his book. Early on, Greenspan lays out his model describing gullible actions as those that arise from the combination of at least two of the following four elements: personality, cognitive style, the state of a person, and the situation a person finds him or herself in. The first and last two chapters deal with the psychology of gullibility, and include an interesting set of examples of gullibility found in the Bible and in various children's stories. The middle chapters are basically a series of short case studies, each exploring gullibility in religion, anti-semitism, war and politics, conspiracy theories, criminal justice, science and academia, finance, and vulnerable populations, including the very old, very young, and brain damaged people. Greenspan offers an even-handed analysis of gullibility on just about every topic he tackles. But after presenting good examples of gullibility on the political right (Reagan's popularity, and the \"strong father\" metaphor), he attempts to balance it with what I think is a bad example of gullibility on the political left. In a backbreaking, half-century stretch back in time, he criticizes left-leaning America for disregarding the brutality of communism, and for continuing to idealize the principles that brought about ultimate failure of the Soviet Union. But why choose this example when there are so many contemporary examples to choose from, any of which would resonate better with current conceptions of liberalism? For example, why didn't Greenspan criticize liberals for falling\u2014hook-line-and-sinker\u2014for some of the blatantly disingenuous \"greenwashing\" campaigns launched by the slick marketing departments of huge corporations? Example: The colorful new British Petroleum TV commercials claiming that the new \"BP\" stands for \"Beyond Petroleum.\" Beyond my ass! Or, why doesn't Greenspan call vegetarians gullible for believing that their soy products\u2014trucked in from half-a-world away\u2014are somehow more environmentally and morally defensible or (comfort word of the day) \"sustainable,\" than good ol' steak and potatoes? How about a chapter called Gullibly Sustainable? I was hoping to find analyses of more exciting topics like multilevel marketing scams (although he does go over Ponzi schemes), Native American shamanism, Mormons, modern urban and cultural legends like the fact that so many people believe AIDS has been cured, or that the CIA introduced crack cocaine into the inner cities to keep black folks down. And once I discovered that Greenspan has a brother with an autistic spectrum disorder, I anticipated a chapter about the whole autism/vaccination debate, but it never came. The only time he came close to addressing anything related to Asperger's or autism, was when he discussed the case of Sheila McGough, a lawyer who \"may have had a form of cognitive impairment known as nonverbal learning disabilities (NLD).\" I thought McGough's story, about her being conned by a client who happened to be a persuasive sociopath, was a poor example for Greenspan to use in his section about the gullibility of lawyers. McGough was someone suffering from NLD who happened to be a lawyer, not an example of a typical lawyer, and most readers would expect her to get scammed, especially by a guy who has successfully scammed normal functioning people. More interesting is how lawyers in general can be gullible (e.g, junk science in the courtroom). One of the most interesting tidbits I took from this book involves a common misconception about degrees of trust among people. Conventional wisdom holds that those who are reluctant to trust others (low trust), have somehow been \"burned\" in the past, while people with high trust are more gullible, and have likely been sheltered, and/or never been betrayed. For Greenspan though, one's concern about failure and betrayal is positioned a priori, rather than as the result of actual betrayals. \"[P]eople low in trust, because of their fear of betrayal, avoid many interactions, thus limiting both their opportunity to learn as well as their opportunity to succeed.\" Thus, if a person has little social experience and is not open to either taking the slightest emotional risk, or discovering new things about various topics, i.e. they are not curious, the person (who might be gullible, but also unsure about whom to distrust) most likely will not have put himself in many situations where he could have been burned, in the first place. Specifically, trust levels are determined by our \"social intelligence.\" In contrast to those with low trust, Greenspan says, \"People with adequate social intelligence are more able to pick up on cues indicating when to distrust someone ... and thus are more likely to base their withdrawal of trust based on evidence rather than on a global overgeneralization that nobody is to be trusted.\" If the low trusting person has been burned, it is generally at no higher a rate than those who have high trust. The difference is that when the high trust people get burned, they do so not out of gullibility, but because their higher social intelligence allows them to put themselves at greater risk, more often. The study of social intelligence is still a growing, mutating, and imperfect science as applied to this book, \"the first of several\" that Greenspan hopes \"will contribute to the development of an interdisciplinary field of Gullibility Studies.\" Greenspan freely admits that part of his interest in studying gullibility stems from the fact that he is gullible. It's implied that, given the right circumstances, everyone is gullible to some extent, which is what's so problematic about Greenspan's four-part list of ingredients for gullibility. It is very difficult to ascertain which elements are at work, or deficient, and to what degree. The result is that the reader becomes confused as to exactly why Greenspan is blaming one person's gullibility on a certain cognitive misfire, or trait, while attributing another's gullibility to some different psychological or situational phenomenon.

[LISTEN 09-07-29 FREE AUDIO DOWNLOAD a Chapter from Mind of the Market In his book [The Mind of the Market](https://michaelshermer.com/the-mind-of-the-market/), Dr. Michael Shermer attempts to answer the question of how we evolved from simple hunter-gatherers such as the Yanamamo people of Brazil to complex consumer-traders such as the Manhattanite people of New York. The Yanamamo have about 300 products, compared to the 10 billion products of the Manhattanites. How did this happen, and why? In this free audio download of the first chapter, Dr. Shermer outlines the problem to be solved and the sciences used to solve it, starting with the study of complex adaptive systems. Evolution and economics are equally counterintuitive for most people to grasp because they look like they were designed from the top down when, in fact, they evolve from the bottom up: in evolution animals are just running around trying to make a living and get their genes into the next generation; in economics people are just running around trying to make a living and get their genes into the next generation. Out of all this running around people develop trust between strangers and begin to trade with them to establish and maintain trusting relationships between groups, and this is what started us down the long path toward modernity.

Carroll. James N. Gardner is an Oregon attorney and the author, most recently, of [The Intelligent Universe: AI, ET, and the Emerging Mind of the Cosmos](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1564149196?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1564149196). Remarkable Creatures Epic Creatures, Remarkable Species a book review by James N. Gardner This year marks the 150th anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin's masterpiece [On the Origin of Species](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451529065?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0451529065). While this event, so seminal in the history of science, will be celebrated in a number of books slated to appear in 2009, none is likely to prove more compelling a read than Sean Carroll's Remarkable Creatures. The \"remarkable creatures\" of which Carroll writes are both the amazing denizens of the biosphere whose existence and ecological niches were largely unknown before 1859, and the brave scientific adventurers who journeyed far and wide to study life on Earth. As Carroll puts it: They are, without exception, remarkable people who have experienced and accomplished extraordinary things. They have lived the kinds of lives that [Mark] Twain extolled \u2014 they walked where no others had walked, saw what no one else had seen, and thought what no one else had thought. Remarkable Creatures encompasses a vast span of geography and history, beginning with Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt's five-year expedition through Central and South America at the beginning of the 19th Century and ending with the dawn of the new science of astrobiology, which searches for and imagines the nature of extraterrestrial life forms yet to be discovered. Three of the best chapters in the book chronicle the intermingled lives of Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, and Henry Walter Bates. Darwin is, of course, the most famous of the trio but what is often overlooked is how vital were the contributions of Wallace and Bates to the birth and acceptance of Darwin's theory of speciation through natural selection. Darwin sketched out his theory almost two decades before [On the Origin of Species](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451529065?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0451529065) appeared but kept silent about his revolutionary ideas because of fear of ostracism. As Carroll writes: \"His species theory was heresy to the dogma of special [divine] creation, and he knew that heretics were not treated well. It was too much of a risk to gamble his soaring reputation on his species theory.\" What finally broke Darwin's silence was fear of a different kind \u2014 terror that his theory would be eclipsed by the work of a young naturalist named Alfred Russel Wallace who had independently developed a theory of natural selection nearly identical to Darwin's. When Darwin famously received Wallace's short paper sketching out the latter's evolutionary ideas in June of 1858, Darwin went into panic mode, confessing that he \"feared that all of my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed.\" In the end, Wallace's paper and a brief outline of Darwin's theory were read together at a meeting of a leading scientific society. Darwin's great book was subsequently published and the rest is history. Would Darwin's name be known to us and forever associated with the theory of evolution absent the goad of fear furnished by Wallace's meager little paper? We shall never know. Nor shall we ever know whether Darwin's theory would have prevailed absent the early validation provided by the third member of the trio \u2014 naturalist Henry Walter Bates. Bates spent eleven incredible years exploring the wonders of the massive Amazon river system. The privations he suffered during those years \u2014 unrelenting heat, yellow fever, fire ants, biting flies and intense loneliness \u2014 were offset by extraordinary rewards. As Carroll writes: Those rewards were many \u2014 river dolphins, anteaters, frigate birds, anacondas, hummingbirds, bird-eating spiders, all sorts of monkeys, jaguars, caimans, blue hyacinthine macaws, parrots, eagles, fives species of toucans, and butterflies \u2014 flocks of butterflies. Bates collected 14,712 animal species in all, of which more than 8,000 were new to science. Of special importance to Darwin's new theory were Bates' discoveries concerning butterflies. After returning to England, Bates wrote his most important scientific paper, which described the phenomenon of mimicry among butterfly species and explained it by means of Darwinian natural selection. Butterfly species edible by predators, Bates noted, could grow to resemble unpalatable butterfly species as a survival strategy. The phenomenon of mimicry became an important source of support for the theory of evolution. Shortly after Wallace returned to England from his journey abroad, he and Bates spent a memorable weekend with Darwin celebrating their mutual adventures in scientific discovery. One can imagine Bates telling his two colleagues something he later wrote about his own deep linkage with Darwin's theory, \"I think I have got a glimpse into the laboratory where Nature manufactures her new species.\" Wild at Heart?

This week on Skepticality, Swoopy talks with Dr. Marc Bekoff, Professor Emeritus of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado and author of Wild Justice. His book examines the differences and startling similarities between the observed morality and emotions of human and non-human animals. Marrying years of behavioral and cognitive research with compelling and moving anecdotes, Dr. Bekoff and his co-author Jessica Pierce reveal that animals exhibit a broad repertoire of moral behaviors, including fairness, empathy, trust, and reciprocity. Underlying these behaviors is a complex and nuanced range of emotions, backed by a high degree of intelligence and surprising behavioral flexibility.

Find out how grassroots skeptics can help ensure that Wikipedia is a science-based public resource. Is it Worth Paying Attention to Wikipedia? Yes, it absolutely is. This is a shining opportunity for the skeptical movement. Wikipedia is among the most important public sources for almost any scientific, pseudoscientific, or paranormal topic. A Wikipedia article is almost always the number one Google hit for that subject. Amazingly, any grassroots skeptic can make responsible improvements to that source at any time, easily and for free. As you learn the ropes, move slowly & cautiously. Start small. Be bold, but edit carefully. Make a meaningful contribution to science & skepticism. You can personally correct any Wikipedia article. As long as you can cite references, you can add the best available skeptical information to any article that needs it. When you add footnote references, you can even link directly to skeptical websites. You don't need anyone's permission. For simple text edits, you don't even need web coding skills. Best of all, it's rewarding and fun to use your skeptical knowledge to enhance an essential public resource. Furthermore, we know from our internal traffic statistics that people really do follow up on the skeptical resources cited in Wikipedia articles. (More people find Skeptic.com through Wikipedia than through Google!) For an in-depth primer, see \" [Why Skeptics Should Pay Close Attention to Wikipedia](http://skeptools.wordpress.com/2008/12/08/why-skeptics-pay-attention-wikipedia/),\" by Tim Farley. How to Get Started As a free encyclopedia anyone can edit, Wikipedia is an almost-utopian project \u2014 but it works. Why? Wikipedia has a [culture of rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars), and a vast community of editors who care about those rules. It's easy for beginners to make mistakes, but (luckily!) the culture of Wikipedia is also easy to learn. The key is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. It's not a soapbox for you personally, for the skeptical movement, or for any other interest group. The standard for Wikipedia articles is therefore a \"Neutral Point of View\" or NPoV. (Wikipedia does have a special [policy for pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV#Pseudoscience_and_related_fringe_theories) that relaxes this NPoV standard, but Wiki editors should always strive for the highest degree of objectivity and rigor.) To help maintain this, Wikipedia requires reliable third-party citations for opinions and statements of fact. It also requires that [notable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Undue_weight#Undue_weight) criticism of any group or concept be described (with citations), and that topics be accurately placed in context against the prevailing current of expert opinion. (Wikipedia's NPoV policy [requires that articles not give \"undue weight\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Undue_weight#Undue_weight) to fringe positions.) These responsible policies open great opportunities for skeptics to contribute. When paranormal assertions are made without support from reliable references, these statements can be [flagged for citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_article_does_not_cite_any_references_or_sources.#Dealing_with_citation_problems) \u2014 or, where appropriate, removed. Where a paranormal article fails to acknowledge scientific criticism, or fails to place a fringe position in its proper context, this criticism or context can be added. Furthermore, citations can link to relevant skeptical resources. Before getting started, please familiarize yourself Wikipedia's [formatting rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_edit) and [Manual of Style.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style) Then, just go to the Wikipedia article for your favorite paranormal topic and see what needs fixing! Edit Boldly\u2014But Be Careful! Wikipedia has a policy called [Be Bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold)! If you see something wrong, fix it! Your corrections are not an imposition \u2014 they are the engine that drives Wikipedia. But editing Wikipedia is still editing. By its nature, editing other people's hard work calls for extreme care. As you learn the ropes, move slowly and cautiously. Start small. Stick to the NPoV wherever possible. When a topic is \"generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community,\" Wikipedia's [policy on pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV#Pseudoscience_and_related_fringe_theories) allows the article to state that scientific verdict and label the topic as \"pseudoscience.\" Nevertheless, you should strive to remain objective and to avoid loaded statements. Avoid statements like \"Astrology is fraudulent nonsense.\" Instead, find relevant sources and cite them, as in this example: Astrology is generally considered a pseudoscience by the scientific community. Skeptics argue that the concept is implausible,1,2 unintelligible,3 and unsupported by evidence.4,5 Notably, large scale tests such as (describe one) have failed to reveal any astrological effect.6 There is also strong disagreement within the community of astrologers. Some proponents contend that X,7 while others believe Y8 or Z.9 See a typo? Don't even hesitate: hit the \"edit\" or \"edit this page\" buttons and make the change. Likewise, if you find vandalism (such as random obscenities) or obvious nonsense (\"Uri Geller is a pterodactyl\") remove these immediately. As you get the hang of it, you may wish to start [ adding \"citation needed\" flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_article_does_not_cite_any_references_or_sources.#Dealing_with_citation_problems), adding relevant [references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#How_to_cite_sources) for disputed or unsupported assertions, or inserting new material. Take your time, and remember that Wikipedia has an error-correction mechanism: if you make a mistake (or push too hard) another editor is liable to reverse your edits. You may eventually work your way up to more ambitious efforts, such as adding new articles. In the meantime, you have an opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to science and skepticism \u2014 right now, today. Wikipedia is only a click away, so [get started](https://www.wikipedia.org/)! Why Haven't Skeptics Acted on this Before? Actually, many skeptics are already working to ensure that skeptical subject matter is discussed responsibly on Wikipedia. In addition to the thousands of individual skeptics who make an occasional edit, there are also organized efforts underway. One effort you may wish to join is the [Wikiproject Rational Skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikiproject_Rational_Skepticism), a voluntary association of skeptical Wikipedia editors. These editors keep a watchlist of articles of interest, cooperating to keep an eye on those for improvement and ongoing maintenance. This sort of vigilance is very important. Like you, paranormal proponents (or even deliberate con men) can change anything they like at any moment. An article that was fine yesterday might be crazy today \u2014 and it will stay crazy until an editor like you checks it and fixes it. You may also be interested in a lower-traffic project external to Wikipedia, called [Skepticwiki](http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page). This is a standalone, explicitly skeptical encyclopedia project that shares the format of Wikipedia. Topics to Tackle\u2014or Avoid Many skeptical Wiki editors tackle topics about skepticism: pages for various skeptical organizations and publications, or for prominent skeptics. Those efforts are very useful, but you may wish to concentrate on the areas where a skeptical eye is really needed \u2014 articles for paranormal topics. When people turn to Wikipedia for information on iridology or \"reptoids\" or chiropractic, that article may often be the only source they consult. Or, if they do consult further sources, these may often be the sources cited in the Wikipedia article. Either way, paranormal proponents have been quick to load Wikipedia with content and citations that are friendly to their own claims. Sometimes, these articles are virtual commercials for paranormal industries. In those cases, skeptics can perform a valuable public service by bringing paranormal articles up to the NPoV standard with descriptions of skeptical criticism and references to relevant skeptical sources. Oddly, the best Wikipedia topics for beginners are the most obscure. High-profile topics (like \"CSICOP,\" or \"homeopathy\") attract lots of attention and edits from proponents and critics alike, leading to relatively neutral articles. That's Wikipedia's error correction mechanism in action: lots of critical eyes. Often, those topics stabilize to a tense compromise, watched like a hawk by opposed editors, with long arguments over small changes. On lesser-known subjects, paranormal proponents have the freedom to make sweeping, biased, and wildly unsupported claims. These low-quality articles stand unchallenged until a skeptic eventually happens to review them. Finding and fixing these is fun and satisfying for skeptical editors. Because those articles are so bad, they are easy to improve \u2014 and edits will tend to stand for a longer Download of a Chapter from Why Darwin Matters In the opening chapter of [Why Darwin Matters](https://michaelshermer.com/why-darwin-matters/), Michael Shermer recounts his voyage to and research in the Galapagos islands with Frank Sulloway as they retraced Darwin's footsteps to better understand how the British naturalist discovered natural selection; Shermer then explains what evolution is, and how he began college as a creationist and how, in time, he came to realize that evolutionary theory was true and one of the greatest explanatory theories in the history of science.

James N. Gardner is an Oregon attorney and the author, most recently, of [The Intelligent Universe: AI, ET, and the Emerging Mind of the Cosmos](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1564149196?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1564149196). Complexity Redux a book review by James N. Gardner The best popular science books are those that give the reader the sense of looking over the shoulder of a leading researcher doing cutting-edge work at the frontier of scientific inquiry. Walter Isaacson's recent biography of Einstein belongs in this category. So too does Melanie Mitchell's comprehensive new book chronicling the latest advances in the sciences of complexity. Mitchell, a professor of computer science at Portland State University and an External Professor at the famous Santa Fe Institute that specializes in the study of complexity, is one of the world's leading experts in the field of genetic algorithm research. This is a special kind of computer science that has the audacious goal of coaxing software to evolve on its own through a process of natural selection that resembles Darwinian evolution. Research into genetic algorithms is representative of the broad portfolio of disciplines comprising the sciences of complexity because it relies on a fusion of seemingly disparate scientific fields \u2014computer science and evolutionary biology \u2014to produce a hybrid possessing (in complexity lingo) emergent properties. For instance, evolutionary computation can yield solutions to seemingly intractable engineering challenges that no human designer could have imagined. The pervasiveness, power and sheer intricacy of evolutionary forces is a unifying theme of Mitchell's book and of the scientific breakthroughs she describes. Some of her best discussion focuses on the seething debate, largely shrouded from the eyes of laypersons, regarding the deficiencies of the so-called Modern Synthesis, which united Darwin's theory of natural selection with Gregor Mendel's path-breaking work in genetics. Current research, made possible by new DNA sequencing technologies, is revealing that some of the fundamental tenets of the Modern Synthesis may be wrong or least seriously incomplete. For instance, the synthesis asserts that natural selection is the major mechanism of evolutionary change and adaptation; that evolution is an inherently gradual process reliant exclusively on small random variations in individuals; and that the origin of new species can be satisfactorily explained by the microscopic process of gene variation and natural selection. As Mitchell demonstrates lucidly, these conclusions are being seriously undermined by researchers who are starting to view the phenomenon of evolution through the prism of the sciences of complexity. Here are just a few of the startling insights that have emerged: - Genes are not static but jump around on their chromosomes and between chromosomes. As Mitchell puts it, \"The result can be a much higher rate of mutation than comes from errors in DNA replication.\" - The complexity of living systems is largely due to networks of genes rather than the sum of the independent effects of individual genes. This explains how human beings and mustard plants can have roughly the same number of genes (about 25,000) but exhibit vastly different levels of biological complexity. - The new field of Evo-Devo (short for evolutionary developmental biology) is providing insights into how evolution can sometimes move at warp speed (for instance, during the Cambrian Explosion half a billion years ago when multicellular animals emerged in a geological blink of an eye). The apparent mechanism is not mutation of ordinary genes but rather mutation of \"master genes\" that regulate the formation and morphology of many of an animal's body parts. The late physicist Heinz Pagels once wrote that he was \"convinced that the nations and people who master the new sciences of complexity will become the economic, cultural, and political superpowers of the next century.\" When you read [Complexity: A Guided Tour](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195124413?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0195124413), you will get a good sense of why Pagels reached that conclusion. TAM7 Field Report This week on Skepticality, Derek & Swoopy recap The James Randi Educational Foundation's Amazing Meeting 7 conference, which took place this past week in Las Vegas, Nevada. Derek recounts his many adventures as a TAM7 attendee, including his interviews and discussions with TAM Guests including Ray Hyman, Jennifer Oullette and MythBuster Adam Savage. Looking at this epic convention in a new way, Swoopy shares her impressions of following the conference from home via social networking websites such as Twitter, Facebook and uStream.

Andrew Shaindlin is the Executive Director of the Caltech Alumni Association and Acting Assistant Vice President for Development at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, CA. He holds a bachelor's degree from Brown University and is completing his master's in education at Claremont Graduate University. He is the author of numerous articles and book chapters on technology in fundraising and alumni relations and regularly speaks on that topic to fellow education professionals. He is also the author of [Alumni Futures](http://www.alumnifutures.com), a blog for higher education professionals. Linked: How Everything is Connected a book review by Andrew Shaindlin Here in Los Angeles celebrity sightings are a dime a dozen, but add the dimension of time and you get a combined parlor game and history lesson. The parlor game is the famous \"six degrees of separation\" (AKA in Tinsletown \"six degrees of Kevin Bacon\"): name a famous individual and trace the shortest possible line of personal connection to that person. The \"six degrees of separation\" moniker was popularized by John Guare's play of the same name, but has a longer pedigree. In the 1960s social psychologist Stanley Milgram attempted to measure the connectedness of individuals who are widely separated in social time and space. His experiment, the methodology of which has since been scrutinized, appeared to show that in some sense we live in a \"small world,\" where people of different social status and separated by thousands of miles, may well be more closely connected to each other than we might assume. In the last several years, a spate of popular works has examined the so-called new science of networks, and using mathematics and logic theory, has sharply defined just how connected to each other we all are, and how an understanding of these networks' shapes can improve business effectiveness, professional networking, and even personal relationships. But let's back up for a minute. Did we say six degrees of separation? Never mind six degrees. Six degrees is for wimps. To wit, I'm two degrees from Adolf Hitler. When I was 11, my father took me backstage after a performance led by illustrious Austrian conductor Karl Boehm, then 81 years old. Boehm had known and supported Adolf Hitler during his ascent to the leadership of the National Socialist Party. The hand I shook had warmly clasped the Fuhrer's hand many decades before. Of course, if you're not a history buff, Hitler may not impress you. Maybe you're into sports. Here I'm two degrees from Babe Ruth. As a little girl in the Bronx, my mother's best childhood friend, Hedda, played hooky from school and sometimes encountered the Bambino in her neighborhood. He sat on a stoop and bounced young Hedda on his knee. I've known Hedda since my childhood, but only recently did I learn that, thanks to her, The Sultan of Swat was part of my social network. But what does it matter how connected we are to someone? After all, we often hear that it's not what you know, it's who you know. But whom do you have to know for a specific purpose? To take my personal anecdotes, if I wanted to get Yankee tickets, knowing someone who could phone up Hitler wouldn't do me any good. But the issue isn't really who your connections are; it's being able to identify them as connections in the first place. This is where Albert-Laszlo Barabasi's work comes in. Linked breaks the six degrees mythos into its constituent parts, explains early efforts to measure just how connected total strangers really are, and brings the reader a simple explanation of the mathematical concepts underlying the \"new science of networks.\" It succeeds admirably in two ways: first, in balancing the technical background of network science with its popular relevance, and second, in illuminating the connections among seemingly disparate fields where network science is hard at work today. This genre is becoming more crowded all the time. Duncan Watts tackled it with his book [Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393325423?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0393325423) (W.W. Norton, 2003). And Watts combined forces with Barabasi and Mark Newman to produce [The Structure and Dynamics of Networks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691113572?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0691113572) (Princeton University, 2006), a more technical treatment of the math these researchers use to unravel the secrets of network behavior. Other recent, similar works use title words like \"sync,\" \"nexus,\" and \"emergence\" to treat related themes. Where Barabasi (a professor of theoretical condensed matter physics at Northeastern University) beats his competition \u2014 and his collaborators \u2014 is in making the science accessible. Drawing on lessons and examples from sociology, medicine, law enforcement, and economics, he shows the practical value of understanding how networks behave. Perhaps the most prominent example is the effect of network structures on something as fundamental as circles of friends. Barabasi takes a well-known social construct \u2014 the strength of weak ties \u2014 and demonstrates its potential quantitative value. In the 1970s, sociologist Mark Granovetter posited that your close circle of friends and colleagues isn't as valuable as you assume it to be when it's time to network for something like a new job. Rather, it's your friends' and colleagues' acquaintances, who you actually don't know well, who add the greatest value to your network. Why? This is simply because the people who are closest to you socially know most of the same people who you already know, and therefore cannot provide much information you don't already have. But more remote acquaintances (such as friends of friends, or your own former co-workers) can provide new contacts that may reveal opportunities you won't know about if you only talk to your immediate family, current co-workers and next-door neighbors. The growth of Internet social networks like LinkedIn and Facebook makes this field of research timely and relevant. Using these services, it's easy to visualize not only who our second- and third-degree acquaintances are, but also how we are connected to them. When we want to reach out to a potential business partner, it's nice to know that we have the choice of asking a professional colleague or a family member for an introduction (and if we're desperate, or lack confidence, we can ask both!). Another important arena that Barabasi explores effectively is the role of network science in financial markets. A better understanding of the links among firms and financial interests is more important than ever, now that credit default swaps and multi-billion dollar [ponzi schemes](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/08-12-23#feature) are the order of the day. Describing the market as a \"directed network\" where not only the connections, but the direction of information flow among network members (or \"nodes\") is clear, Barabasi provides the everyday reader with important tools for understanding why \u2014 and to what degree \u2014 it matters what happens in banking, investment and credit markets. Creeping in around the edges of the seemingly cut and dried math behind network science is a whisper of social engineering. British anthropologist/biologist Robin Dunbar has written about the relationship between neocortex size and social network scale, lifting ever so slightly the lid on the question of whether social network scale is somehow hardwired into humans as an evolutionary variable (see for example, his chapter \"Brains on Two Legs: Group Size and the Evolution of Intelligence\" in [Tree of Origin: What Primate Behavior Can Tell Us about Human Social Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674010043?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0674010043) (Harvard, 2001). In much the same way that Milgram's six degrees construct caught the popular imagination, we can expect a spate of books in the near future that posit how many people we should have in our networks, in order to function optimally on the social networking scene. Indeed, popular business titles such as [The Power of Who: You Already Know Everyone You Need to Know](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1599951533?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1599951533) (Center Street, 2009) with its \"100/40 principle\" already claim to deliver specific ratios to maintain when building (or culling) one's connections. There is a cognitive risk in this kind of scorekeeping. We should not become so caught up in the quantitative aspects of network science that we lose sight of its fundamentally human character. Back in the Bronx in 1927, knowing a thousand people who lived on River Avenue wouldn't have given you as good a chance for Yankee tickets as knowing which one of them was connected to the Maharajah of Mash himself, the one and only Babe Ruth. As Barabasi vividly shows, finding the right needle in the social network haystack is as important as ever. But his research and others' makes it easier for us not only to find the needle, but to use it to deploy the power of our networks. Left, Right & Center Liberals, Conservatives & Libertarians Although the Skeptics Society is apolitical, Michael Shermer sometimes explores political and economic issues in his blog posts. In this week's Skepticblog post, Michael Shermer discusses the issue of the collective versus the individual, a heated debate that arose among the three main speakers from the conference on evolutionary economics in Santiago, Chile: Ullrich Witt (a liberal economist from the Max Planck Institute in Jena, Germany), Kevin McCabe (a conservative economist from George Mason University, known for its unique free market leanings), and Michael Shermer (a \"radical for liberty\").

Beneath the bar room bravado lurks the mind of well-studied, articulate critical thinker. In this week's eSkeptic, Robert Richard responds to Daniel Gasman's review of The Tragic Sense of Life which ran in [eSkeptic (June 10th, 2009)](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/09-06-10#feature). Robert J. Richards is a Morris Fishbein Professor of the History of Science at the University of Chicago. A Response to Gasman's Review of The Tragic Sense of Life by Robert J. Richards In the [June 10, 2009 posting of eSkeptic](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/09-06-10#feature), Daniel Gasman issued a hyperbolically misleading review of my book [The Tragic Sense of Life: Ernst Haeckel and the Struggle over Evolutionary Thought](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226712141?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0226712141) (University of Chicago Press, 2008). I won't attempt to correct all of his mischaracterizations here; I hope at least a few readers will actually take up my book and judge for themselves. Others might care to read some of the many other reviews of the book, which have been published in such journals as The Times Literary Supplement (July 5, 2008), Cell (Dec. 12, 2008), History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences (winter, 2008), American Scientist (Jan.-Feb., 2009), and Science (Feb. 27, 2009). These and other reviews can be found on [my website](http://home.uchicago.edu/~rjr6). Here I will simply make an observation about one representation in his review to give a sense of the quality of his judgment, and then I will summarize my history with Mr. Gasman. I hope this brief response will suggest to readers that they might, as is appropriate to this forum, cultivate a bit of skepticism concerning his essay. In his review, Mr. Gasman sidebars a phrase of mine and renders an interpretation: \"Scholars who denigrate Haeckel compared to Darwin are 'miscreant historians.' \u2014 Robert J. Richards.\" This is not merely quoted out of context; it's quoted out of this world, at least a world that might be alive to irony. The phrase is ripped from a blurb I wrote for another book on Haeckel by Sander Gliboff, whom Mr. Gasman holds in like regard to me. Had he quoted the last two sentences of the blurb, readers might have been aware of the irony of the phrase. Those lines are: He [Gliboff] thereby dexterously measures Haeckel up to Darwin's own standards, despite the assumptions of miscreant historians to the contrary. In his renovative account of H. G. Bronn, Darwin's translator, and his vigorous defense of Haeckel, Gliboff flashes his vorpal blade at scholars of stature and of craft, charging his book with the excitement of competitive history. Those who actually read Gliboff's book would also be aware that the chief \"miscreant\" I refer to is myself, since Gliboff thinks that I get both Darwin and Haeckel wrong. That last sentence of the blurb should have assured Mr. Gasman that I was not referring to him. A bit of history of Mr. Gasman's interactions with me will suggest why I estimate him in the way I do. A few years ago, I wrote an article for the journal Biological Theory (vol. 2, no. 1, 2007) on Ernst Haeckel's alleged anti-Semitism. The article was a preview of my book, which had yet to appear. In the article I claimed that while Haeckel was, by our modern lights, a racist \u2014 though hardly different in that respect from virtually all other biologists and anthropologists of the 19th century \u2014 he was not, as had been supposed, a virulent anti-Semite. I provide evidence that if anything, he should be presumed a philo-Semite, which is how both friends and enemies so regarded him. I also gave a brief account of Haeckel's fate at the hands of the Nazis, some of whom associated his biology with theirs, while others \u2014 Nazi officials \u2014 condemned his work and banned his books. I indicated that I believed Gasman, in his book of 40 years ago, was simply mistaken about Haeckel's attitude toward Jews and how the Nazis used his beliefs, as were Stephen Jay Gould, who adopted Gasman's perspective in [Ontogeny and Phylogeny](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674639413?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0674639413) (1977), and Richard Weikart, in his revealingly titled book [From Darwin to Hitler](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140397201X?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=140397201X) (2004). In response to my article, Mr. Gasman sent a long, acrimonious essay \u2014 hardly as \"subdued\" as his current posting \u2014 to Biological Theory and demanded it be published. The editor and his board refused, though they agreed to publish a letter. Mr. Gasman rejected that option and instead wrote a letter attacking me personally to the publisher of the journal, a university press. Subsequently, Mr. Gasma has written other university presses that have published my books and articles; his letter to the University of Chicago Press, which published my current book, sought to have me \"investigated.\" It was, of course, na\u00efve of him to believe those publishers would not inform me about his quite personal attacks. Aside from these assaults on my integrity sent to academic institutions, Mr. Gasman has, on another, [independently sponsored website](http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/staff/webpages/site.cfm?LinkID=397&eventID=34), uploaded three comparably egregious replies to my work, as well as three separate, vitriolic reviews of my book, ranging in length from 9 to 39 pages. The review in eSkeptic was essentially a duplicate of that third one spilling from his computer. Now given this history, I would think terms like \"unhinged\" might spring to the mind of a moderately wary reader. But again, the best test of the validity of Mr. Gasman's charges would be to examine my book \u2014 sample chapters of which can be found on my website and on the website of University of Chicago Press.

In this week's eSkeptic, Darren Iammarino reviews [Adventures in the Spirit: God, World, Divine Action](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800663187?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0800663187), by Philip Clayton (Fortress Press, 2008). Darren Iammarino is a Ph.D. candidate in his final semester of coursework at Claremont Graduate University. His areas of specialization are comparative religious studies and philosophy of religion. Iammarino is currently working on his own constructive theology known as Cosmosyntheism, as well as publishing a novel self-cultivation system in a forthcoming book: The Compass Path. The Emergence of God by Darren Iammarino In his recent book, Adventures in the Spirit: God, World, and Divine Action, Philip Clayton presents a constructive theology that endeavors to reconcile insights from the sciences with the wisdom derived from two thousand years of Christian tradition. The task is daunting, but through a methodical and lucid point-by-point progression, Clayton succeeds in providing the reader with a truly novel way of understanding God and the God-world relationship for the 21st Century. The book is separated into five sections: The Methods of Philosophy and Theology, Emergence, Panentheism, Divine Action, and the Theological Adventure Applied. Section one sets the stage by explaining the numerous challenges that theology faces today given the major advances in the fields of biology and physics. An informative discussion of the differences between religious truth and scientific truth, plus a succinct account of the contemporary religion-science debate comprises the remainder of the first section. Section two shifts gears and moves into the field of evolutionary biology, in particular the current debate over emergent theories of evolution. Clayton explains that emergence, in contrast to scientific reductionism, is characterized by the fact that higher-order phenomena cannot be fully comprehended by merely applying the laws of lower-order disciplines. In other words, science isn't or should not be, just about reducing life to the realm of physics and chemistry. Clayton further shows that emergence draws a healthy middle ground between reductionism on one end and dualist theories on the other end. Dualistic theories refuse to accept that certain phenomena, such as mind or spirit, can have any relation to a material substrate or lower type of order. The purpose of the lengthy discussion of emergence is to lead us to an understanding of mind and spirit which, according to emergence theories, require a new conceptual framework in order to be properly understood. One possible conceptual framework for elucidating the nature and function of mind, spirit and God is put forth by Clayton in section three. The philosophical position known as panentheism or, all things within God, is employed to highlight the workings of mind and spirit. Clayton presents us with an extended and in-depth look at different versions of panentheism, ranging from German Idealists, to 20th century Process Theology thinkers. Clayton writes, \"The strength of the panentheistic analogy is that it takes the highest level of emergence known to us and uses it as the model for the divine reality. The highest level we know is the level of human personhood\" (131). The question for Clayton is did the universe require a transcendent Source or Ground for all that is, or is the universe merely in a natural, yet meaningless process of emergence from simplicity to complexity? The concept of emergence seems to point in the direction of a \"deising\" universe evolving from extreme simplicity, but Clayton argues that the logic of emergence need not be taken in this nearly atheistic way. Clayton believes that the universe requires a transcendent agent to act as the Ground and initiator of the process of emergence. It is at this point that two traditional, yet confusing, doctrines of the Christian faith are invoked: Trinity and kenosis. First, the inner-trinitarian relations represent a divine community. This is important for Clayton, because the interactions within the immanent Trinity provide a crucial metaphor for comprehending the God-World relationship. Unlike classical trinitarian doctrine, trinitarian panentheism suggests that the created world is within God and is therefore, a key contributor and participant within the divine (173). Kenosis or self-emptying is central to the author's vision because it explains how the process of creation began, while simultaneously affirming the centrality of God as love. Frequent biblical references are made for support of kenosis, in the sense of overflowing goodness and self-giving, or self-emptying, such as Phil 2:5-9: 5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name. It was this kenosis that allowed for the world to be created ex nihilo. However, immediately following the act of creation via God's self-limitation of power, God's experience from that moment onward evolves along with the world's choices. At this point, Clayton is in agreement with Process Theology that God and the World interact via their dipolar natures. Nonetheless, God and the creatures of the world are quite different. \"Human agents differ from the divine in their nature: finite, not infinite; existing contingently rather than existing in all possible worlds; sometimes placing their own limited interests above the divine rather than being by nature perfectly good\" (180). An explanation of divine action according to emergence follows and comprises the bulk of section four. Clayton suggests, in line with process thought, that God guides the process of evolution by providing possibilities and lures for further development, but does not coerce any creatures to make specific decisions. This creaturely freedom is due to God's free self-limitation of power at the moment of creation. The book concludes with an appeal to Christians and scientists for the importance of \"the many faces of integration\" within a globalized world. Summarizing the main points, we find that emergence implies theism, but not any form of classical Christianity. Both scientists and Christians must be willing to seek a new synthesis that does justice to the truths of both disciplines. One new way of conceiving God that overcomes problems in classical theology, such as the paradox of God being love, yet somehow wholly transcendent, immutable and separate, is to understand God panentheistically. Clayton suggests a biblical basis for panentheism, as in Acts 17:28: \"For in him we live and move and have our being.\" As for the scientist, emergence theories have shown that new levels require new explanations. The realm of the mind and spirit have been dealt with by theologians for millennia, so perhaps these religious insights may help to explain persistent ambiguities within strictly scientific understandings of evolution and emergence. The first eight chapters of Dr. Clayton's book are a lucid explanation of the science of emergence and complexity. The following three chapters, transition to Dr. Clayton's own constructive theology, which incorporates the concepts introduced throughout the first part of the book. However, Clayton's \"open kenotic panentheism\" leaves one asking a few questions. The first problem hinges on what is known as the immanent Trinity, or the Trinity before the creation of the world. How can the Trinity, if it is already a much higher emergent level of reality, precede the quantum, chemical and biological levels? This seems to go against the whole argument for emergent complexity proposed in the previous chapters. The other major points of confusion from chapter 9 revolve around the notions of genuine otherness in the world and the problems of evil and freedom. The doctrine of kenosis or self-emptying means that God is the ground of all that is and this leaves Clayton's system open to the standard criticisms from neo-atheists. Ultimately, it is challenging to understand how Clayton's conception of God can be exonerated from culpability for the many evils present in the world. One can also object that if God emptied him or herself of power in order to create other beings, then in theory, why can't God decide to reverse this decision some day? This is a problem for genuine freedom and for the apparent reality that there are genuine others co-existing within this world. In other words, how are the \"other subjects genuine others to Godself\" if God is the Source of all (156)? Chapter 10 presents the reader with two further paradoxes. If the Ground within God is not conscious (170), how can God make primordial selections? Also, one learns that, \"God could have existed with no less perfection without us\" (173). It is bizarre to imagine that God would have created a world, if God gained nothing from it. For process thought, which Clayton is attempting to incorporate, God lacks experiential knowledge, but gains this experience through a reciprocal interaction with the world. The final problem, which is revealed in chapter 11, is how to make sense of the functions of the members of a Trinity before creation. The roles of the Son and the Holy Spirit do not seem to make any sense if there is not already a world with which God interacts.

Through the prisms of archaeology, theology, and evolutionary psychology, Wright's findings overturn basic assumptions about Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and are sure to cause controversy. He explains why spirituality has a role today, and why science, contrary to conventional wisdom, affirms the validity of the religious quest. And this previously unrecognized evolutionary logic points not toward continued religious extremism, but future harmony. Robert Wright introduced the world to evolutionary psychology through his wildly popular bestselling book The Moral Animal: Why We Are the Way We Are. His most controversial book, Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, put forth the theory that human evolution and the history of civilization contain within them an inevitable trend toward more and more win-win nonzero game exchanges between people and groups that has led humans to dominate the planet. In his new book, The Evolution of God, Wright reveals his new theory about the power of globalization and cultural integration.TAGS: Mr. Deity is Here!

The film failed, fortunately, and was thoroughly panned by the critics. But in the cultural brouhaha stirred by the film's release and subsequent disappearance from the big screen, not enough attention has been paid to whether or not there was a historical connection between the social Darwinists of the 19th century with the National Socialists of the 20th century. It turns out that there is, through the personage of the German biologist Ernst Haeckel; but a new biography of Haeckel, published shortly after Stein exited stage left, claims to rehabilitate Haeckel by disconnecting him from German social Darwinism, and thereby exonerating evolutionary theory. Unfortunately this new biography does no such thing, for in the end we must be true to the historical facts. Robert J. Richard's The Tragic Sense of Life: Ernst Haeckel and the Struggle Over Evolutionary Thought [2](#note02) promises to rescue Haeckel from a century and a half of disparaging assessments of his biology, and above all undertakes a refutation of the more recent and widely held belief that he was instrumental in formulating the basic tenets of Nazi ideology. The common understanding among historians about the connection between Haeckel and Hitler is this: Adolf Hitler (b. 1889) came of age during the decade and a half following the publication in 1899 of Ernst Haeckel's Riddle of the Universe, a runaway best seller that over the next two or three decades sold more copies internationally than the Bible and profoundly shaped the consciousness of the modern world. Haeckel's book imparted a rigid Social Darwinist message purportedly derived from science: politics is applied biology, the Jews were an inferior race compared with the Aryans, Christianity was a religion of weakness, and that eugenic action was necessary to protect the racial composition of society. Scholars who denigrate Haeckel compared to Darwin are \"miscreant historians.\" attempts to disentangle Haeckel from Hitler. Haeckel, Richards argues in this elegantly written and technically innovative work, was really a benign political figure with affinities to liberalism rather than to Fascist authoritarianism, and an intellectual personality infinitely more interested in evolutionary science than in a radical, Nazi-like reorganization of society as is generally claimed. Racist eugenics, anti-Semitism, and extreme Germanic nationalism were really strains of thought foreign to Haeckel's beliefs, and Richards claims that Haeckel has been falsely maligned \u2014 especially by me (in The Scientific Origins of National Socialism) and Stephen Jay Gould (in several of his popular essays and in his book, Ontogeny and Phylogeny) \u2014 as having a pernicious influence. [3](#note03) These revisionist claims are intended to arouse considerable interest because if what Richards suggests is true, this would impact not only the history of science, but also a number of other important fields of history that have been linked to Haeckel in recent years: Nazism, anti-Semitism, the Holocaust, eugenics, and the role of science and political ideology. The problem, however, is that a careful reading of Richards' book uncovers a narrative not of insight and innovative thought about an essentially fascinating scientist and dominant public figure, but a process of selective quoting and blatant manipulation of evidence to support the author's thesis; the book turns out to be the creation of an author who seems to have an axe to grind and does not shrink from assertions that are clearly based on a slew of disquieting misrepresentations. This is a serious charge against a highly respected historian of science and Darwinian scholar who won the coveted Pfizer Award of the History of Science Society for his book Darwin and the Emergence of Evolutionary Theories of Mind and Behavior (University of Chicago Press, 1987), and one has to disentangle a number of separate strands of thought that run through Richards' book in order to grasp how material is intentionally controlled so that more often than not only a fictionalized figure emerges, unrecognizable from what is commonly known about Haeckel and his science and philosophy. For much of his academic career Richards has been on a self-declared mission impossible: to reconcile any perceived differences between Haeckel and Darwin and to establish that Darwin created his evolutionary theories from the same sources in German romanticism that determined Haeckel's evolutionary science. Richards seems to have been motivated by the conviction that if Haeckel and Darwin can be shown to be theoretically indistinguishable then there is no foundation for assigning Haeckel a role as a progenitor of National Socialism. If Darwin was not a co-founder of National Socialism, then Haeckel, as the mirror image of Darwin, cannot also be burdened with such a grievous liability. Richards insists over and over again that \"[Haeckel's] theoretical convictions hardly differed from those of Darwin\" and that German Darwinismus was interchangeable with the familiar patterns of English science. [4](#note04) Haeckel did not have a Tragic Sense of Life Richards proposes as his main theme that Haeckel was guided by a tragic sense of life, bearing great similarities to the religious philosophy expounded by the famous Spanish writer and mystic, Miguel de Unamuno: \"Unamuno offers a clue, I believe, for the solution of the puzzle of Haeckel.... Unamuno explored what he took to be the soul-splitting experience of Western intellectuals, their tragic sense of life. He depicted the struggles of a skeptical reason, especially in philosophy and science, as courageously insisting that human striving is mortal, that its efforts end in the grave; yet such reasoning, cannot, he thought, overcome the vital desire for life, for transcendence,\" [5](#note05) and that reason and life, therefore, are fundamentally at odds with each other. Richards thus proclaims that his \"overarching argument will be that Haeckel's science and his legacy for modern evolutionary theory display the features they do because of his tragic sense of life.\" [6](#note06) The trouble with this erudite exegesis \u2014 and Richards' obvious failure to define exactly what transcendence might have actually signified for both writers \u2014 is the fact that Unamuno for the most part conceived his book as an attack on the scientific Monism of Haeckel, which he correctly understood to be the implacable enemy of Christian transcendence. [7](#note07) In Unamuno's Tragic Sense of Life \u2014 and this is not mentioned by Richards \u2014 Unamuno denounced Haeckel [8](#note08) in the strongest language possible, and he decried Haeckel's Monism as a faulty, unsatisfying, and materialistic philosophy because it denied the immortality of the soul: \"Every monist system will always seem materialist,\" hence deficient, Unamuno declared. Rather, \"only dualist systems preserve the immortality of the soul, only those systems which teach that human consciousness is something substantially distinct and different from other manifestations of phenomena.\" [9](#note09) Therefore, \"monist tricks are of no use to us. We want the substance, not the shadow of eternity!\" [10](#note10) It is anybody's guess how this explanation by Unamuno of the dualistic meaning of transcendence, his anguished evocation of the tragic sense of life, and his unconditional rejection of scientific Monism and pantheism, can be reconciled with Richards' flights of imagination about Haeckel's philosophical links to Unamuno as well as Richards' invalid account of Haeckel's supposed quest for transcendence that runs parallel to the religious devotion of the Spanish philosopher. The truth of the matter is that Richards seems uncomprehending of the central ideas contained in Unamuno's remarkable philosophical essay. Impressed by the cultural impact of the Darwinian revolution and modern science in general, Unamuno was concerned about the loss of meaning in life and the undermining of the traditional religious source of faith and ethics brought on by the triumph of Positivism in the 19th century. As a religious thinker, Unamuno suggested that ultimately, human life could only be sustained by irrational Christian faith. For Unamuno it was the tragedy occasioned by the contradiction between the impersonal findings of science and its candid recognition and acceptance of death, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the human need for concrete physical immortality, and for a transcendent humanistic faith and adherence to ethical values that of necessity had to be sustained devoid of scientific and rational authority \u2014 an unresolved dilemma that fuels the tragic sense of life confronting modern man as Unamuno describes it. But for Haeckel, despite what Richards importunes, no such contradictory tragedy exists for modern man. Haeckel embraced death and the meaninglessness of human existence and rejected any belief in transcendent faith. Death in the Christian sense that Unamuno believed in was not to be defeated by spiritual transcendence, but was rather to be embraced as the evolutionary source of new life. For Haeckel, awareness of death was not a tragedy, but only a necessary part of the struggle for existence and evolution, that death begets life. Despite what Richards contends, therefore, Haeckel's position on transcendence and his rejection of all its forms, was the remote antithesis of what Unamuno believed and validated in his classic text. Furthermore Haeckel, despite what Richards urges, did not believe, with Unamuno, that reason is the enemy of life, nor could Haeckel have accepted Christian-like transcendence because his Monism was totally committed to a philosophy of immanence. Such contradictions inevitably weigh heavily on the truth and present insurmountable intellectual problems for the reader, but Richards' analysis bears no relation to the Monism of Haeckel, nor does seem to fully understand the thought of Unamuno. [11](#note11) Furthermore, one should bear in mind that a tragic sense of life implies some aspect of non-fulfillment; that, for example, the attainment of absolute knowledge is forever limited and therefore human beings can never realize certainty in life, especially over questions of morality and the tragedy of human mortality. In other words, Monism is the opposite of a tragic sense of life, because Monism implies total fulfillment based on the absolute reconciliation of opposites. For Haeckel, therefore, the utopian ideal of total fulfillment was possible and he would have rejected as foreign, Unamuno's concerns. In Haeckel's 1899 magnum opus, The Riddle of the Universe, the theme clearly advanced was that knowledge was not limited. On the contrary, for Haeckel, all the riddles of the universe had been or were on their way to being solved. Nothing lay beyond the ability of science to comprehend the complete structure of the cosmos. Thus, the aspect of tragedy that Richards assumes in Haeckel is simply not there. In Richards' analysis, therefore, style endlessly overwhelms substance and the thinking of Haeckel is continually masked in order to obscure its intrinsically anti-humanistic content. Haeckel & Darwin are not Identical A critical theme in Richards' book emphasizes that the distinctions that are conventionally drawn between the science and biology of Darwin and Haeckel are misplaced and that the two scientists are really interchangeable intellectual figures. Richards believes that when correctly analyzed, Darwin is actually a Haeckelian and that his biology draws upon the same sources and closely resembles the science of Haeckel. However, even if one were to admit that there were some common romantic sources in the scientific theories of Darwin (and this is probably not the case), there remain vast theoretical, cultural, and political differences between the two men and Richards' suppositions appear to be hypotheses unsupported by the available evidence. As has been frequently observed, Haeckel's biology assumed the reality of determining forces within nature, a position remote from Darwin's theory of natural selection. [12](#note12) Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that Darwin did not offer a comprehensive philosophy of life, as Haeckel did. As early as the writing of the Generelle Morphologie in 1866, Haeckel presented his evolutionary theory combined with his philosophy of Monism, suggesting that evolution was not just a theory about the development of life and the creation of new species, but a total explanation of the meaning of life. This was very different from what Darwin offered in the Origin of Species, which was simply an explanation for evolution. Monism dominated Haeckel's science and philosophy for the rest of his life, but disturbingly, Richards takes great pains to gloss over this fact as much as possible, uncritically integrating Haeckel's religious ideas into his science. This allows Richards to portray Haeckel as virtually the same as Darwin and therefore not culpable of having developed a mystical philosophy that would dominate not only his science, but also his Germanic nationalism and proto-Fascism. In all other major areas as well, a vast chasm separates the two men. Darwin did not suggest that spontaneous generation had been empirically verified, like Haeckel did. Darwin did not proselytize on behalf of an evolutionary religion that would replace Christianity, nor did Darwin believe in the existence of a world soul, or in pan-psychism, or suggest a predilection for magic or theosophy, all of which Haeckel did. Darwin did not articulate a comprehensive plan of racial eugenics for the regeneration of society, nor was Darwin an anti-Semite, believing that the biblical tradition was at the root of the weakness of European civilization; nor was Darwin an opponent of liberalism. Haeckel was absolutely insistent in his support of the existence of the Aryan race and he explicitly lent his scientific authority to the racial-historical theories of Count Gobineau, hardly a view of the world to which Darwin would have subscribed. Darwin was an abolitionist, [13](#note13) but Haeckel believed in the intrinsic inferiority of the African peoples and used highly charged derogatory racial-infused language about Africans that would have been abhorrent to Darwin. The obvious reality is that Haeckel's Darwinism represents an intellectual and ideological universe totally apart from that of Charles Darwin. Any attempt on the part of Richards to draw parallels between English and German Darwinism represents a distortion that journeys way beyond the parameters of plausible historical evidence and analysis. In stirring language, Richards glorifies the romantic strain in both Haeckel and Darwin, as if to say that this mode of thought was scientifically and philosophically fruitful. But, as is generally conceded, Haeckel's science ultimately collapsed by the end of the 19th century, and that the real weaknesses of Haeckel's biology resided in the fact that he borrowed too heavily from the tradition of German romanticism. In emphasizing this interpretation of 19th century evolutionary history, Richards, therefore, presents historians of science with a serious analytical conundrum: if Haeckel's science was in fact shaped by romanticism and ultimately failed as a consequence, what is the point of idolizing such a methodological approach to investigating the structure of the organic world? And was it, in the end, not the resemblance of the two men, but rather Haeckel's over reliance on romanticism that clearly distinguished his science from the non-romantic science of Darwin? Haeckel Inspired \"Scientific\" Secular Anti-Semitism Richards insists that Haeckel has been misrepresented as an anti-Semite, and that in fact Haeckel stood out during his time as someone who had befriended the Jewish community in Germany. However, Richards is able to arrive at his denial of \"Haeckel's alleged anti-Semitism\" by an egregious manipulation of evidence, including indiscriminate omission of incriminating material and by offering what can only be described as fantastical interpretations of passages from Haeckel's writings dealing with the Jews. Richards repeats the litany that Haeckel has been falsely accused of hostility to the Jews \u2014 \"the tendentious charge of anti-Semitism by Gasman....' [14](#note14) But this claim demonstrates a disturbing lack of knowledge about German history and the history of modern anti-Semitism, because it leaves out the emerging school of \"scientific\" secular anti-Semitism that Haeckel belonged to and was one of the founding fathers and a guiding light. He does not understand that so-called \"scientific\" anti-Semitism was much more lethal and prophetic of National Socialist ideology than purely religious traditional antagonism against the Jews. In my book, Haeckel's Monism and the Birth of Fascist Ideology (1998, 2008) the discussion of the Monist writings of the important French proto-Nazi authors Jules Soury and Georges Vacher de Lapouge \u2014 both translators into French of some of Haeckel's major writings and close disciples of Haeckel \u2014 make clear that the ideological foundations of National Socialist anti-Semitism can be directly traced back to the specific influence of Haeckel. Of course, Richards does not mention any of this material, because he is determined to sanitize his book and omit any historical sources that might undermine his fallacious arguments that seek to deny Haeckel's antagonism towards the Jews and connections with National Socialist ideology in general. In his remarks in 1894 to the literary critic Hermann Bahr in an interview on the Jewish question, [15](#note15) Haeckel declared the \"Jewish Problem\" to be a \"racial question,\" extolled anti-Semitism as a politically creative force, justified its historical role and held the Jews alone responsible for its appearance, and he demanded that the Jews give up their religious identity and disappear from German life as a separate community \u2014 hardly examples of statements Richards believes he has found that prove Haeckel's philo-Semitism. [16](#note16) On a number of separate occasions I have urged Richards to take into consideration the entire text of the Hermann Bahr interview with Haeckel on his attitude towards the Jews, but to no avail; he continues to justify using only a tiny portion of the interview for his analysis and taking the passages selected out of context, in this way continuing to misrepresent Haeckel's position about the Jews. [16](#note16) Richards' \"Moral Grammar\" as Moral Hazard Richards concludes his book with the reprinting of an essay: \"The Moral Grammar of Narratives in the History of Biology \u2014 the Case of Haeckel and Nazi Biology.\" This essay was originally delivered a few years ago (Ryerson Lecture, April 12, 2005) at the University of Chicago. It now makes its reappearance in this forum and Richards attaches great importance to it, believing it to provide a foundation for his belief that the connection between Haeckel and National Socialism is a hypothesis that stems from manipulated historical sources, and not at all a reflection of historical reality in the decades around the turn of the 20th century. Haeckel, he argues, has to be evaluated not in absolute moral terms, but in regard to the ethical context of his own times. However, Richards is unable to show that moral consciousness was substantially different a little over a century ago in Germany, a country situated at the very heart of European civilization; there were no fundamentally different moral standards in operation at the time that could be taken to be essentially at odds with our own values. Richards unjustifiably confuses remote historical times with the contemporary world that certainly would include the late 19th and early 20th century, the period when Haeckel was politically and scientifically active. In this essay Richards undertakes a historiographical excursion that challenges the sensibilities of even hardened readers, decrying the writing of history in general as an exercise in manipulation as far back as Herodotus and Thucydides, and eventually ending up with a denunciation of historians like myself who, by linking Haeckel with National Socialism, have \"caus[ed] sputtering convulsions,\" [17](#note17) because of a deceptive narrative of historical causality. What Richards overlooks is that Haeckel and his followers had a lot to say about ethics and morality. They were not passive onlookers at the society in which they lived, as Richards seems to suggest, but they constantly talked and wrote about the need to break down conventional religious standards in the light of the discoveries of evolutionary science. The Monists celebrated the defeat of Judeo-Christian ethics in the name of the struggle for existence and the demands of evolution, a discussion that would figure so poignantly in the writings of Nietzsche and the cultural tragedy he felt coming with the death of God. By neglecting to point this out, Richards succeeds in casting Haeckel and the Monists in ahistorical terms as purveyors of conventional morality. Haeckel, however, was constantly at war with the traditional beliefs of European civilization, hoping to revolutionize the very ethical basis of society, and this represents a disturbing moral reality that does not enter into any of Richards' calculations about the need for the historian to evaluate individuals in terms of their own society. [18](#note18) Richards accuses historians who criticize Haeckel of distorting evidence by cutting quotations. Of course no examples are provided by Richards. [19](#note19) This is an unfounded accusation because it is Richards himself who is doing all the \"cutting\" of relevant sources. Richards, for example, earlier in his text, discusses a book that Haeckel wrote during the First World War, Eternity, where all the National Socialist like statements are excised by Richards and Haeckel is misleadingly presented as simply a tragic world weary figure, a detached victim of the war and not a bitter politically motivated extreme nationalist lamenting the defeat of the German Empire and fuming about the racial catastrophe occasioned by the introduction of African and Asian troops onto the continent of Europe by the Allied armies. [20](#note20) Omitted by Richards are racial warnings raised by Haeckel: \"Deep students of ethnology and far-sighted statesmen point with anxiety to the grave consequences that are sure to follow this 'fraternalization' of all the races both to England herself and the supremacy of the white race as a whole.\" The Allies were tragically oblivious to the fact that the \"cultural and psychological differences that separate the highest developed European peoples from the lowest savages are greater than the differences that separate the savages from the anthropoid apes.\" [21](#note21) After the armistice in November 1918, Haeckel, obsessed with racial concerns and reflecting a long tradition in Monist eugenics about the threat to Europe posed by the exponential growth of the populations of the East, complained in a letter written to a soldier at the front that he \"feared that the greatly longed for peace will result in a full reversal of modern culture. Our laughing heirs will apparently be the yellow Mongolians.\" [22](#note22) Richards rejects my evaluation (along with that of other historians) of Haeckel and the Nazis, because he claims we advance a \"mono-causal\" theory. \"I have objected,\" Richard writes, \"to the ways in which these historians have attempted to link Haeckel with the rise of the Nazis and the actions of Hitler in particular. They have not, for instance, properly weighed the significance of the main other causal lines that led to the doctrines of National Socialism \u2014 the social, political, cultural, and psychological strands that many other historians have emphasized.\" [23](#note23) But this criticism of Richards is invalid and is advanced to deflect attention away from Haeckel's Nazism. It is not that there has been a failure to take into consideration additional contributing factors in the rise of National Socialism, but rather that the more conventional explanations of the past have, on the whole, not been successful and have fallen frequently by the wayside after the discovery of new information. The explanations for the rise of National Socialism and Fascism apart from emphasis on Haeckel have had a tendency to break down and this has occurred many times. On the other hand, the connection of Haeckel, National Socialism, and Monist Science continually yields more meaningful theoretical results and this approach is confirmed by the latest scholarly research. [24](#note24) In the very last paragraph of his book Richards reveals how little he grasps about the connection between Haeckel and Nazism. Richards suggests that in the end the Nazis borrowed just a few lines from the eugenic literature of Monism and nothing more; and that, in fact, Haeckel was completely rejected by the Nazis. [25](#note25) In other words, the substance of Nazism has nothing to do with Haeckel's Monist program. Such statements bear no relation to a much more complex and contrasting historical truth about the very real connection between Haeckel and Hitler.

His lecture/sermon is based on his bestselling book, Thank God for Evolution: How the Marriage of Science and Religion Will Transform Your Life and Our World, which has been endorsed by 5 Nobel Prize-winning scientists and dozens of other scientific and religious luminaries across the spectrum. Since April 2002, he and his wife, Connie Barlow, an acclaimed science writer, have lived permanently on the road sharing a sacred view of evolution with religious and secular audiences of all ages, as America's evolutionary evangelists. At home in both conservative and liberal settings, and uniquely gifted at building bridges between religious and nonreligious people, Michael \u2014 once a young-earth creationist minister \u2014 is passionate about sharing the 14-billion-year epic of evolution in ways that uplift and expand heart, mind, and soul. Don't miss this [an article debunking the myth of the connection between vaccines and autism](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-06-20#feature), and we were hoping that by now this sad tale of pseudoscience would have died a slow death as researchers continue to find no link whatsoever between the two. Sadly that is not the case. In fact, thanks to Playboy model Jenny McCarthy, mother of an autistic child, the myth has gained cultural traction as never before, as she and her partner, the comedian Jim Carrey, make the media rounds and appeal to the heart strings of the public, burying the science in a tsunami of emotion. So we return again to the topic with our SkepDoc, Harriet Hall, M.D., demolishing the myth once and for all. Vaccines & Autism A Deadly Manufactroversy by Harriet Hall, MD, \"The SkepDoc\" During a question and answer session after a talk I recently gave, I was asked for my opinion about the vaccine/autism controversy. That was easy: my opinion is that there is no controversy. The evidence is in. The scientific community has reached a clear consensus that vaccines don't cause autism. There is no controversy. There is, however, a manufactroversy \u2014 a manufactured controversy \u2014 created by junk science, dishonest researchers, professional misconduct, outright fraud, lies, misrepresentations, irresponsible reporting, unfortunate media publicity, poor judgment, celebrities who think they are wiser than the whole of medical science, and a few maverick doctors who ought to know better. Thousands of parents have been frightened into rejecting or delaying immunizations for their children. The immunization rate has dropped, resulting in the return of endemic measles in the U.K. and various outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the U.S. children have died. Herd immunity has been lost. The public health consequences are serious and are likely to get worse before they get better \u2014 a load of unscientific nonsense has put us all at risk. The story is appalling. It involves high drama, charismatic personalities, conspiracy theories, accusations, intimidation, and even death threats. It would make a good movie. It does make a good book: Dr. Paul Offit has explained what happened in Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure. [1](#note01) I can't tell the whole story here, but I'll try to cover the highlights as I understand them. I'll include some new revelations that were not available to Offit when his book went to press. As I see it, there were 3 main stages to this fiasco: The MMR Scare In 1998 a British doctor named Andrew Wakefield published an article in the respected medical journal The Lancet [2](#note02). He did intestinal biopsies via colonoscopy on 12 children with intestinal symptoms and developmental disorders, 10 of whom were autistic, and found a pattern of intestinal inflammation. The parents of 8 of the autistic children thought they had developed their autistic symptoms right after they got the MMR vaccine. The published paper stated clearly: \"We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described. Virological studies are underway that may help to resolve this issue.\" \"Falsehood flies, and the truth comes limping after.\" Despite this disclaimer, Wakefield immediately held a press conference to say the MMR vaccine probably caused autism and to recommend stopping MMR injections. Instead, he recommended giving the 3 individual components separately at intervals of a year or more. The media exploded with warnings like \"Ban Three-in-One Jab, Urge Doctors.\" The components were not available as individual vaccines, so people simply stopped immunizing. The immunization rate in the U.K. dropped from 93% to 75% (and to 50% in the London area). Confirmed cases of measles in England and Wales rose from 56 in 1998 to 1348 in 2008; two children died. In one small hospital in Ireland, 100 children were admitted for pneumonia and brain swelling caused by measles and three of them died. So, 14 years after measles had been declared under control in the U.K. it was declared endemic again in 2008. Wakefield's data was later discredited (more about that later) but even if it had been right, it wouldn't have been good science. To show that intestinal inflammation is linked to autism, you would have to compare the rate in autistic children to the rate in non-autistic children. Wakefield used no controls. To implicate the MMR vaccine, you would have to show that the rate of autism was greater in children who got the vaccine and verify that autism developed after the shot. Wakefield made no attempt to do that. His thinking was fanciful and full of assumptions. He hypothesized that measles virus damaged the intestinal wall, that the bowel then leaked some unidentified protein, and that said protein went to the brain and somehow caused autism. There was no good rationale for separating and delaying the components, because if measles was the culprit, wouldn't one expect it to cause the same harm when given individually? As one of his critics pointed out: \"Single vaccines, spaced a year apart, clearly expose children to greater risk of infection, as well as additional distress and expense, and no evidence had been produced upon which to adopt such a policy.\" Wakefield had been involved in questionable research before. He published a study in 1993 where he allegedly found measles RNA in intestinal biopsies from patients with Crohn's disease (an inflammatory bowel disease) [3](#note03). He claimed that natural measles infections and measles vaccines were the cause of that disease. Others tried to replicate his findings and couldn't. No one else could find measles RNA in Crohn's patients; they determined that Crohn's patients were no more likely to have had measles than other patients, and people who had had MMR vaccines were no more likely to develop Crohn's. Wakefield had to admit he was wrong, and in 1998 he published another paper entitled \"Measles RNA Is Not Detected in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\" [4](#note04) In a related incident, at a national meeting he stated that Crohn's patients had higher levels of measles antibody in their blood. An audience member said that was not true \u2014 he knew because he was the one who had personally done the blood tests Wakefield was referring to. Wakefield was forced to back down. In 2002, Wakefield published another paper showing that measles RNA had been detected in intestinal biopsies of patients with bowel disease and developmental disorders. [5](#note05) The tests were done at Unigenetics lab. Actually, Wakefield's own lab had looked for measles RNA in the patients in the 1998 study. His research assistant, Nicholas Chadwick, later testified that he had been present in the operating room when intestinal biopsies and spinal fluid samples were obtained and had personally tested all the samples for RNA with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The results were all negative, and he testified that Wakefield knew the results were negative when he submitted his paper to The Lancet. Chadwick had asked that his name be taken off the paper. So the statement in the paper that \"virologic studies were underway\" was misleading. Virologic studies had already been done in Wakefield's own lab and were negative. Wakefield was dissatisfied with those results and went to Unigenetics hoping for a different answer. Soon Wakefield's credibility started to dissolve. The Lancet retracted his paper. Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet, described the original paper as \"fatally flawed\" and apologized for publishing it. Of Wakefield's 12 co-authors, 10 issued a retraction: We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between (the) vaccine and autism, as the data were insufficient. However the possibility of such a link was raised, and consequent events have had major implications for public health. In view of this, we consider now is the appropriate time that we should together formally retract the interpretation placed upon these findings in the paper, according to precedent. Attempts to replicate Wakefield's study all failed. Other studies showed that the detection of measles virus was no greater in autistics, that the rate of intestinal disease was no greater in autistics, that there was no correlation between MMR and autism onset, and that there was no correlation between MMR and autism, period. In 2001 the Royal Free Hospital asked Wakefield to resign. In 2003, Brian Deer began an extensive investigation [6](#note06) leading to an expos\u00e9 in the The Sunday Times and on British television. In 2005 the General Medical Council (the British equivalent of state medical licensing boards in the U.S.) charged Wakefield with several counts of professional misconduct. One disturbing revelation followed another. They discovered that two years before his study was published, Wakefield had been approached by a lawyer representing several families with autistic children. The lawyer specifically hired Wakefield to do research to find justification for a class action suit against MMR manufacturers. The children of the lawyer's clients were referred to Wakefield for the study, and 11 of his 12 subjects were eventually litigants. Wakefield failed to disclose this conflict of interest. He also failed to disclose how the subjects were recruited for his study. Wakefield was paid a total of nearly half a million pounds plus expenses by the lawyer. The payments were billed through a company of Wakefield's wife. He never declared his source of funding until it was revealed by Brian Deer. Originally he had denied being paid at all. Even after he admitted it, he lied about the amount he was paid. Before the study was published, Wakefield had filed patents for his own separate measles vaccine, as well as other autism-related products. He failed to disclose this significant conflict of interest. Human research must be approved by the hospital's ethics committee. Wakefield's study was not approved. When confronted, Wakefield first claimed that it was approved, then claimed he didn't need approval. Wakefield bought blood samples for his research from children (as young as 4) attending his son's birthday party. He callously joked in public about them crying, fainting and vomiting. He paid the kids \u00a35 each. The General Medical Council accused him of ordering invasive and potentially harmful studies (colonoscopies and spinal taps) without proper approval and contrary to the children's clinical interests, when these diagnostic tests were not indicated by the children's symptoms or medical history. One child suffered multiple bowel perforations during the colonoscopy. Several had problems with the anesthetic. Children were subjected to sedation for other non-indicated tests like MRIs. Brian Deer was able to access the medical records of Wakefield's subjects. He found that several of them had evidence of autistic symptoms documented in their medical records before they got the MMR vaccine. The intestinal biopsies were originally reported as normal by hospital pathologists. They were reviewed, re-interpreted, and reported as abnormal in Wakefield's paper. All the reports of measles RNA in intestinal biopsies came from one lab, Unigenetics. Other labs tried to replicate their results and failed. An investigation revealed that: - Unigenetics found measles RNA with a test that should only detect DNA. - They failed to use proper controls. - The lab was contaminated with DNA from an adjoining Plasmid Room. - Duplicate samples that disagreed were reported as positive. - Positive controls were occasionally negative and negative ones positive. - The lab was never accredited. - It refused to take part in a quality control program. - When tested by an outside investigator, it failed to identify which coded samples contained measles virus. - The investigator said \"I do not believe that there is any measles virus in any of the cases they have looked at.\" - The lab is no longer in business. So both Wakefield and his study have been completely discredited. He moved to the U.S. and is now working in an autism clinic. He has many followers who still believe he was right. The Mercury/Thimerosal Scare In 1998, U.S. legislation mandated measuring mercury in foods and drugs. The data came in slowly, and by 1999 the FDA had learned that infants could get as much as 187.5 mcg of mercury from the thimerosal in all their vaccines. They were concerned because mercury is toxic. Mercury poisoning caused the Minamata disaster in Japan; however, that was methylmercury and the mercury in vaccines was ethylmercury. The amount of mercury in vaccines was within recommended guidelines. EPA guidelines for permissible mercury exposure were based on methylmercury and were conservative \u2014 they were keyed to protect the most vulnerable patients, fetuses. There were no EPA guidelines for ethylmercury, but it was considered to be far less dangerous because it is eliminated more rapidly from the body. Two mothers of autistic children published their own \"research\" saying that the symptoms of autism were identical to those of mercury poisoning. [7](#note07) I don't agree. You can look up the descriptions of mercury poisoning and autism and draw your own conclusions. I don't see how anyone could confuse the two \u2014 their presentations are entirely different, with only a few symptoms that could be interpreted as similar. Thimerosal is a preservative that allows vaccines to be sold in multi-dose vials. It contains ethylmercury. It was tested and found to be safe before it was added to vaccines. Animal studies showed no adverse effects. In 1929 in Indiana it was tested as a treatment in a meningitis outbreak \u2014 adults injected with 2 million mcg (10,000 times the total amount in all children's vaccines) didn't develop symptoms of mercury poisoning. A study from the Seychelles showed that children getting high doses of methylmercury from fish did not develop neurologic symptoms. A study of children in the Faroes who were exposed in utero to whale meat highly contaminated with methylmercury showed subtle neurologic abnormalities (not autism), but a causal connection was not clear because the fish there were also contaminated with PCBs. The World Health Organization concluded: The theoretical risk from exposure to thimerosal has to be balanced against the known high risk of having no preservative in vaccines. Therefore, WHO, UNICEF, the European Agency for Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA), and other key agencies continue to recommend the use of vaccines containing this preservative because of the proven benefit of vaccines in preventing death and disease and the lack of data indicating harm. In 1999 the U.S. removed thimerosal from vaccines. Why? The decision was not based on evidence but on one person's opinion. Neal Halsey railroaded the committee and threatened to hold his own press conference if they didn't do what he wanted. He meant well. His passion convinced the other committee members to invoke the precautionary principle \u2014 essentially bending over backwards to prevent any possible harm from a high total body burden of mercury from a combination of diet, environmental and vaccine sources. He didn't even consider autism: he was only concerned about possible subtle neurologic damage. They announced their decision in words guaranteed to confuse the public and create suspicion: \"current levels of thimerosal will not hurt children, but reducing those levels will make safe vaccines even safer.\" A 2007 editorial [8](#note08) in The New England Journal of Medicine stated: Although the precautionary principle assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution, the alarm caused by the removal of thimerosal from vaccines has been quite harmful. For instance, after the July 1999 announcement by the CDC and AAP, about 10 percent of hospitals suspended use of the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, regardless of their level of risk. [Because a thimerosal-free hepatitis B vaccine was not available.] One 3-month-old child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of overwhelming infection. It went on to point out: The notion that thimerosal caused autism has given rise to a cottage industry of charlatans offering false hope, partly in the form of mercury-chelating agents. In August 2005, a 5-year-old autistic boy in suburban Pittsburgh died from an arrhythmia caused by the injection of the chelating agent EDTA. Although the notion that thimerosal causes autism has now been disproved by several excellent epidemiologic studies, about 10,000 autistic children in the United States receive mercury-chelating agents every year. A further insanity has been perpetrated by the father-and-son team of Mark and David Geier. They claimed that autistics have premature puberty and high testosterone levels (there is no evidence that this is true). They hypothesized that testosterone forms sheet-like complexes with mercury in the brain (there is no evidence that this is true), preventing mercury's removal by chelation. Their solution? They administered the drug Lupron to lower testosterone levels to supposedly facilitate mercury excretion. The treatment amounts to chemical castration. Lupron is sometimes ordered by the courts to chemically castrate sex offenders, and it is used to treat precocious puberty and certain other medical conditions. It is not a benign drug. It can interfere with normal development and puberty and can put children's heart and bones and their future fertility at risk. The treatment involves painful daily injections and costs $5000 to $6000 a month. The Geiers use 10 times the recommended dose. The company that makes Lupron does not support its use for this purpose. Like Wakefield, the Geiers have been accused of professional misconduct. They built their own lab in their basement and formed their own institute to conduct Lupron studies. Then they formed their own Institutional Review Board (IRB) to approve studies. IRBs are required by law and must follow strict guidelines to ensure that studies are ethical and to protect the rights of subjects. The IRB they formed was illegal. They packed the board with friends and relatives: every single member of this IRB was either one of the Geiers, an anti-thimerosal activist, a Geier associate, or a lawyer suing on behalf of \"vaccine-injured\" clients. One was the mother of a child who was a subject in the research. Even worse, they let the principal investigator sit as the chair of the IRB overseeing his own research protocols. Oh, and the IRB wasn't even registered until 2 years after the research was done. Mark Geier has made a career of testifying as an expert witness in autism cases. He has not impressed the judges. Here are a few of the judge's comments: - \"Seriously intellectually dishonest\" - \" ... not reliable or grounded in scientific methodology and procedure ... his testimony is subjective belief and unsupported speculation.\" - \"I cannot give his opinion any credence.\" - \" ... a professional witness in areas for which he has no training, expertise, and experience.\" When thimerosal was removed from vaccines, there were no studies showing that it was harmful. After its removal, study after study showed that it was not harmful. But activist groups didn't let the new evidence interfere with their beliefs. Anti-vaccine groups have viciously attacked medical doctors and researchers for simply stating what the current scientific evidence shows. They accuse them of being shills for \"Big Pharma\" or covering up for government agencies, and they call them offensive names; but they don't stop there. They threaten people who write about the scientific evidence, and they threaten their children. Dr. Offit, the author of Autism's False Prophets, received a direct death threat that got the FBI involved. He had to use a bodyguard and cancel a book tour. One threatening phone call ominously demonstrated that the caller knew Offit's children's names, ages, and where they went to school. Another scientist who received threats was so afraid for her children's safety that she vowed never to write anything about autism again. One anti-vaccine activist had the bad grace to accuse science blogger Orac of lying when he said he was mourning his mother-in-law's death from cancer. She refused to believe he could be sorry his mother-in-law died because he's not sorry about supporting vaccines that kill children. There was no thimerosal in any vaccine except the flu vaccine after 2002. The \"mercury militia\" expected autism rates to drop, thereby proving the mercury connection. Autism rates rose. Instead of relinquishing their belief, they made implausible attempts to implicate new sources of atmospheric mercury, from cremations of bodies with mercury amalgam fillings or from pollution wafted across the Pacific from China. The Vaccines-In-General Scare If the MMR scare can be attributed to Andrew Wakefield and the mercury scare to Neal Halsey, the next stage of hysteria is epitomized by Jenny McCarthy, actress and anti-vaccine activist extraordinaire. Jenny's son Evan is autistic. At first she subscribed to the fanciful notion that she was an Indigo mother and Evan was a Crystal child. Indigos are \"difficult\" children who are alleged to possess special traits or abilities such as telepathy, empathy, and creativity, and are said to represent the next stage in human evolution. Many of them fit the diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Crystal children represent an even more advanced evolutionary step. They are \"so sensitive, so vulnerable to the world around them, that they go inward, disconnect as best they can from even humans and do their best to survive in a world where they really don't yet fit.\" They are often diagnosed as autistic. After a while McCarthy gave up on that fantasy and accepted that Evan was autistic. She became convinced that vaccines had caused his autism. She treated him with unproven dietary restrictions, anti-yeast treatments, and supplements, and claims to have cured him. She thinks her \"Mommy instincts\" are more valid than science. She says \"My science is Evan, and he's at home. That's my science.\" She realizes that withholding vaccines will lead to the deaths of children. As quoted by Time magazine: I do believe sadly it's going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe. If the vaccine companies are not listening to us, it's their f___ing fault that the diseases are coming back. They're making a product that's s___. If you give us a safe vaccine, we'll use it. It shouldn't be polio versus autism. She and her partner Jim Carrey have spoken out at every opportunity on talk shows, on the Internet, and through books and public appearances. When someone questions Jenny's beliefs her usual tactic is to try to shout them down. She is supported by maverick doctor Jay Gordon, who values listening to parents over science and who supports a delayed vaccine schedule not because of any evidence but just because he thinks it's a good idea. On one talk show, a pregnant mother with several autistic children tried to tell Gordon that her child who had the worst autism was the one who had not been vaccinated. He not only refused to listen to what she was saying but tried to drown her out, loudly insisting she mustn't vaccinate the new baby. A member of Quackwatch's \"Healthfraud\" online discussion list reported sitting next to Evan's paternal grandmother at a dinner. Grandma said Evan's symptoms of autism were evident before he was vaccinated, and he is not doing as well as Jenny says. Grandma is writing her own book \u2014 I look forward to its revelations. Jenny and her cohorts claim they are not anti-vaccine, but they are certainly a good facsimile thereof. The goalposts keep moving. First it was the MMR vaccine, then it was thimerosal, then it was mercury from all sources, then it was other vaccine ingredients, then it was too many vaccines, then it was giving vaccines too early. They will not be satisfied until science can offer a 100% safe and a 100% effective vaccine proven to have no side effects of any kind even in a rare susceptible individual. That's not going to happen in this universe. The other vaccine ingredients that have been questioned include formaldehyde, aluminum, ether, anti-freeze, and human aborted fetal tissue. Scientists have explained over and over that these ingredients are either not present in vaccines or are harmless, but activists ignore the facts and keep making the same false claims. Formaldehyde is harmless in small amounts and is even produced naturally in the human body. Aluminum is an adjuvant used to increase the efficacy of vaccines, and is not harmful. Ether might be used in the manufacturing process but is not present in the vaccines. There is no ethylene glycol or even diethylene glycol in vaccines. (Anti-freeze is ethylene glycol.) And to obtain enough virus to make a vaccine, the virus must be grown in tissue cultures that were originally derived from monkey, chicken, or sometimes human fetal cells; but there is no human or animal tissue of any kind present in the vaccine itself. Apple trees grow in soil, but there is no soil in applesauce. Some anti-vaccine websites perpetuate the myth that infectious diseases were already disappearing and that the vaccines had nothing to do with it. Those myths are easily dispelled by historical data. Vaccine critics ignore the large body of evidence from incidents around the world where as the vaccination rate dropped, the rate of disease rose; and when the vaccination rate rose again, the disease rate dropped. No one can seriously deny the effectiveness of vaccines. They are the most impressive accomplishment of modern medicine. Giving up the known benefits of vaccines because of a vague hypothetical possibility of risk is a poor trade-off. We were able to eradicate smallpox, and we ought to be able to eradicate all the diseases that are spread solely by human-to-human contact. Once enough people have been vaccinated to eradicate the disease, no one will ever have to be vaccinated for that disease again. Smallpox is long gone; polio and measles are next on the list. Polio had been reduced to only 3 countries a few years ago. Then Nigeria stopped vaccinating due to rumors that the vaccines were an American plot to sterilize their children or give them AIDS. The polio rate soared and the disease broke out to several other countries, as far away as Malaysia. When the rate of immunization reaches a certain level, the population is protected by what we call herd immunity. It means there are not enough susceptible people for the disease to keep spreading through a community. In many places the herd immunity has already been lost. It is only a matter of time before diseases break out again. One traveler from a country with polio could reintroduce the disease into the U.S. Lowered vaccination rates endanger even those who have been vaccinated, because the protection is not 100%. People who are immunosuppressed, chronically ill, or too young to have been vaccinated are also put at risk. Parents who choose to delay vaccination are prolonging their children's period of risk. And they are endangering everyone else's public health. Scientists had been urged to \"listen to the parents.\" They did listen to the parents and then conducted research to test the parents' hypotheses. There were various kinds of studies in different countries by different research groups. The results were consistent: - 10 studies showed MMR doesn't cause autism - 6 studies showed thimerosal doesn't cause autism - 3 studies showed thimerosal doesn't cause subtle neurological problems Now it's the parents who won't listen to the scientists. Autistic children and their parents are being misled and victimized with useless, untested, disproven, expensive, time-consuming, and even dangerous treatments. Despite the evidence that mercury doesn't cause autism, children are still being treated with IV chelation to remove mercury \u2014 at least one child has died as a result. Along with Lupron injections for chemical castration, children are being treated with secretin, restricted diets, supplements of all kinds, intravenous hydrogen peroxide, DAN (Defeat Autism Now) protocols, cranial manipulation, facilitated communication, and other nonsense. One family was strongly urged to take out a second mortgage on their home so they could buy a home hyperbaric oxygen chamber. The real tragedy is that all this hoopla is diverting attention from research into effective treatments (usually behavioral) and into the real causes of autism (almost certainly genetic, with environmental triggers not ruled out). An anti-anti-vaccine backlash is now afoot. Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases are being reported. Scientists are speaking out. Blogs like Respectful Insolence and Science-Based Medicine have covered the subject in depth. The Chicago Tribune published an expos\u00e9 of the Geiers. [9](#note09) Even Reader's Digest has contradicted Jenny. They said that vaccines save lives and do not cause autism and they stressed that the science is not on Jenny's side. Let us hope that sanity will prevail before too many more children die from vaccine-preventable diseases. They are dying now.

Steve Salerno is the author of [SHAM: How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400054095?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1400054095). Optimism is Good for Your Brain by Mark Robert Waldman & Andrew Newberg, MD As skeptical researchers with a penchant for thorough and accurate assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of positive thinking and optimism, we are dismayed by Salerno's apparent lack of comprehension (and exclusion of references to back up his claims) when it comes to the hundreds of studies relating to this important psychological and neurological topic. A brief analysis of the 97 abstracts that are cited if you enter \"positive thinking\" (let alone the 3553 references to its companion term, optimism) as a key word in the databases of the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health ( [www.pubmed.gov](http://www.pubmed.gov)) will demonstrate that Salerno has not done his homework. Hope, optimism, and the belief in a positive future (i.e., faith) is essential for human psychological and neurological functioning, a concept that was first addressed in the 1950s by the psychiatrist Vicktor Frankl, who was imprisoned in a Nazi death camp until the end of World War II. In his famous book, Man's Search for Meaning, he said that the single most important thing that kept a survivor alive was faith. If a prisoner lost faith in the future, he was doomed, because the will to live seldom returned. For Frankl, faith was essential for dealing with all aspects of life: \"A weak faith is weakened by predicament and catastrophes whereas a strong faith is strengthened by them.\" [1](#note01) Now, faith in an optimistic future may be a placebo, but it's important to remember that placebos can cure, on the average, 30% of the majority of physical and emotional diseases. Even an irrational belief in a cure that has been proven not to work can significantly boost the body's immune system when dealing with a deadly disease. [2](#note02) But what about unrealistic faith or optimism? Recently, a team of National Institutes of Health researchers concluded that \"a moderate optimistic illusion\" appears to be neurologically essential for maintaining motivation and good mental health. [3](#note03) They also found that highly optimistic people had greater activation in the same parts of the anterior cingulated, a part of the brain that plays a crucial role in controlling anxiety, depression, and rage, as well as fostering social awareness and compassion. [4](#note04) Even the medical researchers at the Mayo Clinic stress the importance of optimistic thinking for maintaining optimal health. They found that positive thinking decreases stress, helps you resist catching the common cold, reduces your risk of coronary artery disease, eases breathing if you have certain respiratory diseases, and improves your coping skills during hardships. [5](#note05) An optimistic attitude specifically reduces the stress-eliciting cortisol levels in your body [6](#note06), and many other studies have demonstrated how optimism improves behavioral coping in a variety of physical illnesses [7](#note07), and in a forty year follow-up conducted at Duke University, optimists had increased longevity when compared to pessimistic individuals. [8](#note08) As reported in the November 2007 issue of Nature, if the human brain did not have a bias toward optimism, we would be prone to increased anxiety and depression. [9](#note09) However, anxious individuals have a more difficult time suppressing negative thoughts [10](#note10), and often get caught up in the repetitive process of rumination. This, unfortunately, strengthens the neural circuits that are generating anxiety and embedding the information into long term memory banks. Optimism is also related to the neurological mechanism known as the placebo effect. If you strongly believe in something \u2014 in other words, if you have enough faith in your self \u2014 you will stimulate both your immune system and your motivational system into action. [11](#note11) Skeptics might argue that maintaining an illusory optimism is problematic, but the evidence points in the opposite direction. Researchers at the University of California found that people who have self-enhancing illusions exhibit lower cardiovascular responses to stress, more rapid cardiovascular recovery, and lower baseline cortisol levels. [12](#note12) In fact, an unrealistically optimistic belief about the future appears to be health protective, even when dealing with a disease as serious as AIDS. [13](#note13) And in an article just published in March, 2009 issue of Behavioral Cognitive Psychotherapy [14](#note14), researchers expected to find qualities of unrealistic optimism in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. Instead they found the opposite, and thus the lack of positive thinking contributed to their overestimation of perceived threats in the world. In another study, optimism added months, and even years to patients suffering from diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. [15](#note15) It will even increase your resistance to common colds and flu viruses, but it also bias you toward under-estimating the severity of your symptoms. [16](#note16) Other studies, however, have pointed out that unrealistic optimism adds a decreased perception of risk. [17](#note17) Optimism does cause people to underestimate their risk of getting divorced and to overestimate their prospects for success in the marketplace, and these are important implications to consider, especially when it comes to health-related concerns. For example, optimistic smokers underestimate their chances of getting ill. [18](#note18) So the question we must face is this: Are we using our optimistic beliefs to maintain a destructive behavior or belief? If so, then a healthy dollop of reality-testing should be added to your recipe for health. Optimism is also associated with a less realistic view of the world. [19](#note19) But then again, so is pessimism. [20](#note20) Pessimism, however, has few benefits, and it leaves the person more at risk to depression, anxiety, sleeping problems, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and impaired social functioning. [21](#note21) In a thirty year longitudinal study conducted by the Mayo Clinic, pessimism was significantly associated with a shorter life-span and poorer mental functioning.

Mayo Clin Proc. 2002 Aug;77(8):748-53. Salerno's Response Sometimes when I receive criticism I'm left wondering: Did they actually read the piece? This is such a case. For the record, I have never argued that optimism has no legitimate role in life. I argue that the frenzied overselling of optimism as a blanket prescription for all that ails us is one of the more subtly destructive forces in American culture. Just as scholastic self-esteem gurus were dead-wrong when they led us to believe that so-called \"bolt-on\" self-esteem automatically yields academic excellence, there's no question that today's gurus of optimism have led the nation down the primrose path in declaring that an upbeat attitude is its own foolproof reward. My real quibble, then, is with undue optimism about optimism \u2014 \"the notion that the riddle of success is more easily solved by attitude than aptitude,\" as I wrote near the top of the story. I was primarily indicting the commodification of optimism, and I stand by that assessment. (The gurus are right about one thing, however. Optimism does produce a great deal of wealth: their own.) Authors Waldman and Newberg, meanwhile, offer us an object lesson in how a few scraps of \"emerging science,\" as it's called in those smarmy TV ads for dubious new health-care products, become conventional wisdom. They write, for example, that \"medical researchers at the Mayo Clinic stress the importance of optimistic thinking for maintaining optimal health. They found that positive thinking decreases stress, helps you resist catching the common cold, reduces your risk of coronary artery disease, eases breathing if you have certain respiratory diseases, and improves your coping skills during hardships.\" That's one seriously overstated mouthful, because the Mayo researchers \"found\" no such thing; if you go to the Mayo site, you'll see that they speculate that positive thinking may pay these dividends ... and even those tentative declarations are made based on \"some\" (cherry-picked?) studies. Not coincidentally, this is the same strategy elevated to an art form by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in touting its pet nostrums. The authors also rely on the common ploy of argument-by-poetry, framing philosophy as truth. This is most clear in the several quotes from Victor Frankl. Much like the transcendent line, \"All men are created equal,\" the Frankl quotes sound terrific but enjoy no scientific standing. As for the charge that I haven't done my homework: Although my piece may not be annotated in strict academic style, I wonder how the authors overlooked the references to the work of Roy Baumeister, Charles Elliott, Charles Sykes, Jean Twenge, etc. \u2014 people who clearly have done their homework. But that's not even the main point. Cleverly, the authors have embraced another staple New Age tactic by inverting the scientific method: telling me it's my job to prove that optimism is ineffective, when in fact it's their job, as members of the movement making all these claims, to conclusively demonstrate the efficacy of optimism, hope, PMA, etc. We still have no way of knowing whether optimistic people actually do better at life or whether they just feel better about the same old crappy life (and therefore are less motivated to change anything). Do they end up like those American students, steeped in self-esteem, who got the worst grades in international testing but had the highest subjective self-assessments? To paraphrase the famous line from the movie, \"Show us the money.\" Overall, the authors represent a blended (and, as I see it, disingenuous) \"compromise\" between science and spirituality that, on closer inspection, necessarily calls for throwing science out the window. Waldman and Newberg are authors of a new book, [How God Changes Your Brain](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345503414?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0345503414), whose very premise and central concept \u2014 God \u2014 cannot, by their own admission, be proved. In their book, Waldman and Newberg write, \"Having an accurate perception of reality is not one of the brain's strong points.\" And: \"The human brain seems to have difficulty separating fantasies from facts.\" Fair enough ... but is that where a true scientist should leave things? Do we then embrace the fantasies? Isn't it the scientist's job to weed out the real from the unreal; to wean people off the unreal; and to encourage people to work within the realm of the real, even if reality is less comfortable than fantasy? Otherwise what is the purpose of skepticism to begin with? One final point. What I find amusing about the so-called \"studies\" of the role of mental outlook in health care is this: If a positive attitude is so decisive in health-care outcomes, then why not do a real controlled study wherein the control group tries to heal itself through PMA alone? Say, let's have two groups of grievously ill heart patients, both with 95 percent blockage of the coronary arteries. Group 1 undergoes heart bypass plus blood thinners, etc. Group 2 forgoes all medical intervention and tries to get better just by visualizing the unclogging of their arteries. (If you like, we can even compose Group 1 from a bunch of pessimistic curmudgeons.) Report back and tell me how it goes. upcoming lectures at Caltech...

You will be surprised by some of Dr. Hall's findings. Be sure to check out the relevant books and the Skeptic back issue that we've highlighted in the article which are available at Shop Skeptic. The Placebo Effect by Harriet Hall, MD Jane D. was a regular visitor to our ER, usually showing up late at night demanding an injection of the narcotic Demerol, the only thing that worked for her severe headaches. One night the staff psychiatrist had the nurse give her an injection of saline instead. It worked! He told Jane she had responded to a placebo, discussed the implications, and thought he'd helped her understand that her problem was psychological. But as he was leaving the room, Jane asked, \"Can I get that new medicine again next time instead of the Demerol? It really worked great!\" What's going on here? What is the placebo effect and how does it work? The term \"placebo effect\" is unfortunate; it leads to misunderstandings. Placebos themselves don't have any effect. They are inert: that's what placebo means. The word placebo comes from the Latin for \"I please.\" You can think of it as the opposite of \"I benefit.\" What we really mean by \"the placebo effect\" is not some mysterious effect from giving an inert treatment, but the complex web of psychosocial effects surrounding medical treatment. Those effects occur with effective treatments too, not just with inert treatments. Mark Crislip, MD, thinks the placebo effect is a myth. \"I think that the placebo effect with pain is a mild example of cognitive behavioral therapy; the pain stays the same, it is the emotional response that is altered ... Ain't no such thing as a placebo effect, only a change in perception.\" [1](#note01) He's correct in saying that the placebo effect does nothing to change the pain signals in the nerves. But most people think the change in perception is the placebo effect and is worth pursuing. There is a big difference between pain and suffering. A woman's labor pains hurt, but with a joyful end in sight she may not suffer as much as a man who has milder pain sensations but is worried that his injured leg may need to be amputated. Some people say that morphine doesn't relieve pain so much as make you not care about it. The experience of pain and the meaning of pain for the patient matter as much as the strength of the pain stimulus. If the placebo effect can do anything to divert the patient's attention or help him reframe the meaning of his pain, his altered perception can reduce his experience of suffering. Beecher Says Placebos Are Powerful In 1955, Dr. Henry Beecher published a seminal paper entitled \"The Powerful Placebo\" in the Journal of the American Medical Association. [2](#note02) He reviewed studies that compared an active treatment to a placebo, and found that on average 35% of patients improved with the placebo. So any study that doesn't have a placebo group for comparison is likely to give a false positive result. The placebo-controlled trial is now one of the cornerstones of medical science. It's not enough to show that Miracle-mycin works; we have to show that it works better than a dummy pill that looks like Miracle-mycin but only contains sugar. Beecher's paper has been widely cited as evidence that 35% of patients respond to placebos, but that's not really what it showed. He wasn't measuring the placebo effect in isolation \u2014 he was actually measuring a combination of the placebo effect, the natural course of disease, and other factors. The patients who apparently responded to placebo included patients who showed improvement for other reasons. Reasons like spontaneous improvement, fluctuation of symptoms, regression to the mean, answers of politeness, experimental subordination, conditioned answers, misjudgment, etc. Hrobjartsson Says Placebos Are Powerless To tease out how much of that 35% should be attributable to placebo, we need to know how many patients might have reported improvement without any treatment. In 2001 two Danish researchers, Asbjorn Hrobjartsson and Peter Gotzsche, published a paper entitled \"Is the Placebo Powerless?\" in the New England Journal of Medicine. [3](#note03) They reviewed studies that included a no-treatment group, and they compared the improvement with placebos to the improvement with no treatment. They \"found little evidence in general that placebos had powerful clinical effects.\" For studies with a binary outcome (improved versus not improved) there was no significant difference between the placebo and no treatment groups. For studies with continuous outcomes, there was some apparent effect of placebo; but not so for objective outcomes that could be measured by someone else, such as blood pressure, but only for subjective outcomes that depended on self-reports, such as pain. They weren't even sure about that, however, because the effect was greater in smaller trials, indicating possible bias. But Placebos Do Work, Don't They? It's hard to reconcile a study like this with what we know about placebos from experiences like the case of Jane D. They do seem to work, and they seem to work very dramatically at times. In a study of pain after dental surgery, patients were given either intravenous morphine or a saline placebo. If they were told that the saline was a powerful new painkiller, they got just as much relief as the patients who received morphine. In another study, all patients were given morphine for post-op pain, but only half were told they were getting it. The patients who didn't know they were getting it only experienced half as much pain relief. In a study of acupuncture for post-op dental pain, there was no difference between the \"real\" acupuncture and placebo \"sham\" acupuncture groups, but when they asked patients which group they thought they were in, they discovered that those who believed they were in the \"real\" group reported significantly more pain relief than those who believed they were in the \"sham\" group \u2014 regardless of which group they were actually in! We not only know placebos \"work,\" we know there is a hierarchy of effectiveness: - Placebo surgery works better than placebo injections - Placebo injections work better than placebo pills - Sham acupuncture treatment works better than a placebo pill - Capsules work better than tablets - Big pills work better than small - The more doses a day, the better - The more expensive, the better - The color of the pill makes a difference - Telling the patient, \"This will relieve your pain\" works better than saying \"This might help.\" In one study patients were given the same aspirin in either a brand name bottle or an unlabelled bottle; it worked better if it was labeled as a brand they recognized. Our pharmacy used to stock two different brands of allergy pills that were made in the same factory and were identical except that one was green and the other was blue. When a patient said it wasn't working any more, we'd switch him to the other brand and it would start working again. Along with placebo effects, there are nocebo (\"I harm\") effects. People getting inert treatments often report new symptoms. A friend of mine stopped taking her homeopathic sleep remedy because she thought it was causing side effects. (Homeopathy is the ultimate placebo because its remedies usually contain nothing but water.) In the Women's Health Initiative study of postmenopausal hormone treatment, when the treatment was stopped, 63% of the women taking hormones reported withdrawal symptoms, but so did 40% of the women taking a placebo. If we tell patients a treatment may cause nausea, they are far more likely to report nausea than if we don't mention that possibility. The placebo effect is mainly subjective. Placebos don't work on patients who are asleep or unconscious. You have to know you're being treated. Placebos don't keep women from getting pregnant. They don't cure cancer, heal broken bones, or do anything you can measure objectively. They work for more elusive complaints like headache, depression, itching, shortness of breath, tension, indigestion, and other symptoms that require us to accept the patient's self-report of what he is experiencing. That doesn't imply that those symptoms are not real. Some misguided doctors have tried to use placebo response as a test to diagnose whether a patient is really sick or not. That test doesn't work, and even if it did it would be unethical. Some researchers believe that placebos can have objective effects. When doctors painted warts with an inert dye and told patients the wart would disappear when the color wore off, the warts disappeared. Patients with newly implanted pacemakers improved even before the pacemakers were turned on. Asthmatics' airways dilated when they were told they were getting a bronchodilator. Colitis patients treated with placebo not only reported feeling better but actually had less inflammation of the intestines visible on sigmoidoscopy. Patients with ulcers healed faster when given two placebo pills instead of one. Harvard University medical researcher Herbert Benson believes that the placebo effect yields clinical improvement for 60-90% of diseases, including angina, asthma, herpes simplex, and ulcers. Studies that have not been replicated have suggested that the placebo effect can influence things like swelling, movement disorders, temperature, pulse, blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and exercise tolerance. So far the evidence for objective placebo effects is weak. Another hypothesis is that the placebo effect is only subjective, but that these subjective effects can indirectly lead to objectively measurable effects. For example, if you are in pain and the placebo effect decreases your perception of that pain, you might expect your pulse and blood pressure to drop. If you are asthmatic and are wheezing, any psychological factor that reduces your anxiety level or helps you relax might indirectly ease your breathing symptoms and even allow your constricted bronchi to dilate. In this view, the placebo effect doesn't really cause objective effects, it allows you to have a different experience of your symptoms and it is that different experience that indirectly affects your physiology. Semantic quibbling, perhaps. Placebo surgery is another controversial subject. Forty years ago, a young Seattle cardiologist named Leonard Cobb conducted a unique trial of a procedure then commonly used for angina, in which doctors made small incisions in the chest and tied knots in two arteries to try to increase blood flow to the heart. It was a popular technique \u2014 90% of patients reported that it helped \u2014 but when Cobb compared it with placebo surgery in which he made incisions but did not tie off the arteries, the sham operations proved just as successful. The procedure, known as internal mammary ligation, was soon abandoned. [4](#note04) In a more recent study, sham arthroscopic surgery was compared to real arthroscopic surgery for knee osteoarthritis. The patients who had only a skin incision got just as good results. One patient who was told he had the sham procedure still refers to it as the surgery that cured him. Some people question whether studies like these really show that surgery has a placebo effect. Maybe the surgery was unnecessary and patients would have improved anyway. How Could It Work? If the placebo effect is real, what might the mechanism be? We can't just write it off as delusions of hyper-suggestible patients. There's evidence that several things might be going on. The main hypotheses are: expectancy, motivation, conditioning, and endogenous opiates. - Expectancy is an established psychological phenomenon. It even affects vision: we are more likely to see what we expect to see. Wine tastes better if the price is higher. Kids like fast food better if it comes in a McDonald's wrapper. If we expect to feel pain we are more likely to feel pain. If we are told to expect a strong painkiller, we're more likely to get pain relief. - Motivation, the need or desire to improve health or get relief, has been shown to contribute independently to the placebo response. Patients who are strongly motivated to get well are more compliant and follow health advice more conscientiously. And patients who are more compliant about taking their placebo pills regularly get a stronger placebo response. - Conditioning is what Pavlov did to his dogs. People learn to associate pills and medical treatments with relief of symptoms. The body even learns physiologic responses: dogs salivate when injected with morphine; after they become conditioned, injecting a placebo makes them salivate, although not as much. - Endogenous opiates are pain-relieving chemicals produced in the brain that mimic the effects of opium-like drugs (morphine, etc.). There is some evidence that when patients respond to placebos, their brains produce more of these chemicals. Imaging studies have shown activation of opioid receptors in the brain when people are told that a placebo is a painkiller. And there is evidence that giving a drug that blocks the effect of narcotics can also block the placebo effect. Dopamine levels increased in the brains of Parkinson's patients after taking a placebo; and patients who said they felt better released higher levels of dopamine. In another brain imaging study, researchers had patients play a game and estimate their chances of winning. The same reward areas in the brain lit up in subjects who thought they would win as in patients who were most convinced that the placebo painkiller would work. Another study of patients who preferred either Coca Cola or Pepsi found that brand information was processed in a different part of the brain than taste from blind taste tests. We may be seeing clues about how the brain handles anticipation, expectation, optimism, previous experience, or who knows what. There may be genetic differences or differences in dopamine receptor responsiveness. Brain imaging is a blunt tool, and it's too soon to know what these studies mean, but it's a promising avenue of research. Can Animals Respond to Placebos? Believers in homeopathy and acupuncture tell us that animals respond to those treatments and animals can't respond to placebos, so that must mean those treatments are effective. But the veterinary literature accepts the reality of placebo response in animals, and there are plausible explanations: - They can develop a learned physiologic response to a drug and then respond similarly when a placebo is substituted. - They respond to attention and care from humans. - Human owners can experience the placebo effect for their pets by perceiving a response where there really is none. - Since animals can't talk, we have to interpret an animal's behavior as indicating relief of pain; this may not always be accurate. What About Ethics? Some people don't even want to know whether a treatment is a placebo or not. If they feel better, that's all that matters to them. In Snake Oil Science: The Truth About Complementary and Alternative Medicine, R. Barker Bausell argues that the primary benefit of alternative therapies is a placebo effect, often enhanced by ritual and impressive pseudoscientific jargon. If we can give patients a placebo and relieve their pain, what's wrong with that? If a little white lie benefits the patient, why not lie? The answer is that it's unethical for doctors to lie to patients or prescribe ineffective treatments, and because deception undermines the doctor-patient relationship in the long run. Also, as Bob Carroll of [The Skeptic's Dictionary](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b086PB) points out, \"the placebo can be an open door to quackery.\" [5](#note05) In a recent study in Denmark, 48% of doctors reported prescribing a placebo at least 10 times in the last year, including antibiotics for viral infections and vitamins for fatigue. Specialists and hospital-based physicians were less likely to prescribe them. A 2004 study of physicians in Israel found that 60% reported using placebos for reasons like \"fending off\" requests for unjustified medications or calming a patient. What if doctors were honest? If they told patients a treatment was a placebo, would that destroy the placebo effect? Maybe not. After clinical trials, patients who were told they'd been taking the placebo have asked if they could keep taking it. In one study patients were told one pill was inert and would only serve as a \"dose extender\" (i.e., a placebo that would allow a lower dose of the effective pill); patients accepted it and were able to lower their dose. What if a doctor tells a patient a treatment is not supported by any scientific evidence but some people believe it has helped them? Placebos raise ethical dilemmas on which doctors do not agree. In a recent court case, the proponents of a particular form of quackery known as Q-rays admitted their device was bogus, but argued that since the placebo effect was effective they were justified in selling it. The court disagreed. Is there any ethical way doctors can use the placebo effect to help their patients? Yes, of course. They already do. The placebo effect is an integral part of every doctor-patient interaction. Good doctors have always gained their patients' trust and given them hope and reassurance. What's effective is not the placebo, but the meaning of the treatment. We enter into a human relationship with a caring person who offers to help us. We may be given a token of that caring in the form of a prescription. We may have a conditioned response to expect improvement because we have been helped in the past. We get a story, a narrative that explains why we feel sick and what we can do to get better. We get hope, support, human warmth, touch. All these factors might lead to an actual physiological response in which our pulse rate drops, we relax, our stress hormones decrease, and other changes facilitate healing, or at least comfort. One study supposedly showed that patients recovered faster if their window looked out on trees rather than a brick wall; even if they didn't recover faster, wasn't it nice to give them a view? Even if we can't document a quantifiable effect on patient outcome, the quality of life is important. Effective treatments have placebo effects too. A substantial percentage of the effects from antidepressants may be placebo effects. Morphine works even better if your doctor tells you it's strong. We can't isolate placebo effect from conventional medicine \u2014 it gets us thinking the wrong way. As the neurologist Robert Burton says, \"Even given our advanced state of medical knowledge, much of routine medical care \u2014 from treating backaches to the common cold \u2014 relies primarily upon reassurance and hope, not disease- specific treatments ... we need to reconsider how to facilitate the placebo effect with minimal risk and cost, and without deception.\" [6](#note06) References [^](#return01)Crislip, Mark. \"The .org/?p=158](http://www.%20sciencebasedmedicine%20.org/?p=158)> [^](#return02)Beecher, HK. \"The Powerful Placebo.\" Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol. 159, No. 17. 1955.

Such intentional pain occurs not only on a local level \u2014 within families, with \"friends,\" or in work situations, but also on a national and international scale \u2014 Hitler's Holocaust, Stalin's purges, and Chairman Mao's slaughter of millions. Neuroscience is providing the potential for a revolution in our understanding of why \"bad\" people do what they do. Professor Barbara Oakley uses evolutionary theory \u2014 as well as an unusually adventurous background that has earned her the nickname of a \"female Indiana Jones,\" to knit together disparate pieces of research that point toward answers to some of the most compelling questions in the social sciences and humanities. Dr. Oakley's work at Oakland University involves bioengineering in many different contexts, such as the effects of electric fields on cells and the complex relationship between neurocircuitry and social behavior. She worked for several years as a Russian translator on Soviet trawlers in the Bering Sea; she met her husband while working as a radio operator at the South Pole station in Antarctica; and she has gone from private to regular Army Captain in the U.S. military.

Barrett Brown is the author of [Flock of Dodos: Behind Modern Creationism, Intelligent Design, and the Easter Bunny](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0978721306?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0978721306) and serves as director of communications for Enlighten the Vote, a political action committee dedicated to promoting the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. His work has appeared in dozens of publications including National Lampoon, The Onion A.V. Club, McSweeney's, American Atheist, and The Fortean Times. Adventures in Math & Marriage or, Why Gay Marriage Does Not Decrease Straight Marriage by Barrett Brown Does the legalization of gay marriage contribute to the decline of heterosexual marriage? A good portion of our fair republic's cultural conservatives seem to believe that it does. Evangelical kingpin James Dobson, head of Focus on the Family, told a typically credulous Larry King in November of 2006: In the Netherlands and places where they have tried to define marriage [to include gay couples], what happens is that people just don't get married. It's not that the homosexuals are marrying in greater numbers, it's that when you confuse what marriage is, young people just don't get married. If what Dobson says is true, New Jersey is going to be in huge trouble, and Massachusetts, which legalized gay marriage in 2004, must already be. Of course, Dobson is wrong. Here's why. First, let's think about this problem mathematically and prepare our variables. X is any country \"where they have tried to define marriage [to include gay couples],\" in Dobson's description. Y is the marriage rate among heterosexuals before country X has \"tried to define marriage [to include gay couples],\" and Z is the allegedly decreasing heterosexual marriage rate that exists after ten years of gay civil unions. The Dobson Theorem, as we shall call it, states that \"if X, then Y must be greater than Z.\" Or, translating math into English, \"if a nation allows for civil unions, the marriage rate among heterosexuals at the time that this occurs will be higher than it is ten years later.\" Let us now test the Dobson Theorem. Like most things with variables, the Dobson Theorem requires that X be substituted for various things that meet the parameters of X\u2014in this case, northern European countries. Luckily, Dr. Dobson himself has provided us with some data. During the Larry King interview, Dobson mentioned Norway and \"other Scandinavian countries\" as fitting the description. We'll also need values to punch in for Y and Z. These may be obtained from all of the countries in question, which have famously nosy governments. Conveniently enough, these numbers may also be obtained from the October 26, 2008 edition of the Wall Street Journal op-ed page, where William N. Eskridge, Jr., the John A. Garver professor of jurisprudence at Yale University, and Darren Spedale, a New York investment banker, penned an editorial based on their new book entitled [Gay Marriage: For Better or For Worse? What We've Learned From the Evidence](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195326970?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0195326970). According to Eskridge and Garver, Denmark began allowing gay civil unions in 1989. Ten years later, the heterosexual marriage rate had increased by 10.7 percent. Norway did the same in 1993, and a decade later the heterosexual marriage rate had increased by 12.7 percent. Sweden followed suite in 1995, and ten years later the heterosexual marriage rate had increased by 28.7 percent. And these marriages were actually lasting. During the same time frame, the divorce rate dropped 13.9 percent in Denmark, 6 percent in Norway, and 13.7 percent in Sweden. So, we may probably dispense with the Dobson Theorem. But how did Dobson get this relationship so wrong in the first place? The culprit may be the Weekly Standard and National Review gadfly Stanley Kurtz, who took issue with Garver and Eskridge's preliminary findings back in 2004, before they were published. Confronted with statistics indicating that marriage in Scandinavia is in fine shape, Kurtz instead proclaimed that \"Scandinavian marriage is now so weak that statistics on marriage and divorce no longer mean what they used to.\" Brushing aside numbers showing that Danish marriage was up ten percent from 1990 to 1996, Kurtz countered that \"just-released marriage rates for 2001 show declines in Sweden and Denmark.\" He failed to note that they were down in 2001 for quite a few places, including the United States, which of course had no civil unions anywhere in 2001. And having not yet had access to the figures, he couldn't have known that both American and Scandinavian rates went back up in 2002. As for Norway, he says, the higher marriage rate \"has more to do with the institution's decline than with any renaissance. Much of the increase in Norway's marriage rate is driven by older couples 'catching up.'\" It's unclear exactly how old these \"older couples\" may be, but at any rate, Kurtz thinks their marriages simply don't count. But even if we arbitrarily strike such nuptials from the record, we're still left with an increase in Norway's marriage rate, as Kurtz himself acknowledges that these oldster nuptials only constitute \"much\" of the increase, not all of it or even most of it. So Kurtz's position is that Norwegian marriage is in decline because not only are younger couples getting married at a higher rate, but older couples are as well. Kurtz applies a similar level of statistical acumen to divorce rates. \"It's true that in Denmark, as elsewhere in Scandinavia, divorce numbers looked better in the nineties,\" he wrote. \"But that's because the pool of married people has been shrinking for some time. You can't divorce without first getting married.\" This is true. It's also true that Denmark has a much lower divorce rate than the United States as a percentage of married couples, a method of calculation that makes the size of the married people pool irrelevant. Denmark's percentage is 44.5, while the United States is at 54.8 percent. Incidentally, those numbers come from the Heritage Foundation, which also sponsors reports on the danger that gay marriage poses to the heterosexual marriage rate. Still, Kurtz is upset that many Scandinavian children are born out of wedlock. \"About 60 percent of first-born children in Denmark now have unmarried parents,\" he says. He doesn't give us the percentage of second-born children who have unmarried parents, because that percentage is lower and would thus indicate that Scandinavian parents often marry after having their first child, as Kurtz himself later notes in the course of predicting that this will no longer be the case as gay civil unions continue to take their non-existent toll on Scandinavian marriage. Since the rate by which Scandinavian couples have children before getting married has been rising for decades, it's hard to see what this has to do with the more recent advent of gay marriage\u2014unless, of course, you happen to be Stanley Kurtz. \"Scandinavia's out-of-wedlock birthrates may have risen more rapidly in the seventies, when marriage began its slide. But the push of that rate past the 50 percent mark during the nineties was in many ways more disturbing.\" Of course it was more disturbing to Kurtz. By the mid-1990s, the Scandinavians had all instituted civil unions, and thus even the clear, long-established trajectory of such a trend as premature baby-bearing can be laid at the feet of the gays simply by establishing some arbitrary numerical benchmark that was probably going to be reached anyway, calling this milestone \"in many ways more disturbing,\" and hinting that all of this is somehow the fault of the gays. By the same token, I can prove that the establishment of the Weekly Standard in 1995 has contributed to rampant world population growth. Sure, that population growth has been increasing steadily for decades, but the push of that number past the 6 billion mark in 2000 was \"in many ways more disturbing\" to me for some weird reason that I can't quite pin down. Of course, this is faulty reasoning. One could just as reasonably argue that by virtue of its unparalleled support for the invasion of Iraq, the Weekly Standard has actually done its part to keep world population down. Why is Kurtz so disturbed about out-of-wedlock rates? Personally, I think it would be preferable for a couple to have a child and then get married, as is more often the case in Scandinavia, rather than for a couple to have a child and then get divorced, as is more often the case in the United States. Kurtz doesn't seem to feel this way, though, as it isn't convenient to feel this way at this particular time. Here are all of these couples, he tells us, having babies without first filling out the proper baby-making paperwork with the proper federal agencies. What will become of the babies? As long as we're looking at trend lines, we may conclude that they'll continue to outperform their American counterparts in math and science, as they've been doing for quite a while.

In The Medea Hypothesis, renowned paleontologist Dr. Peter Ward proposes a revolutionary and provocative vision of life's relationship with the Earth's biosphere, one that has frightening implications for our future \u2014 yet also offers hope. Using the latest discoveries from the geological record, he argues that life might be its own worst enemy. This stands in stark contrast to James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis \u2014 the idea that life sustains habitable conditions on earth. In answer to Gaia, which draws on the idea of the \"good mother\" who nurtures life, Ward invokes Medea, the mythical mother who killed her own children. Could life by its very nature threaten its own existence? Ward demonstrates that all but one of the mass extinctions that have struck Earth were caused by life itself. He looks at our planet's history in a new way, revealing an Earth that is witnessing an alarming decline of diversity and biomass \u2014 a decline brought on by life's own \"biocidal\" tendencies. And the Medea hypothesis applies not just to our planet \u2014 its dire prognosis extends to all potential life in the universe. Breathtaking in scope, The Medea Hypothesis is certain to arouse fierce debate and radically transform our worldview.TAGS: [ecology](https://www.skeptic.com/tag/ecology/), [geology](https://www.skeptic.com/tag/geology/) TO ESKEPTIC plus, share it via your favourite social apps Beginning with this issue of eSkeptic, you can share your thoughts using the new comment field at the end of every eSkeptic (including all the back issues!).

Through the prisms of archaeology, theology, and evolutionary psychology, Wright's findings overturn basic assumptions about Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and are sure to cause controversy. He explains why spirituality has a role today, and why science, contrary to conventional wisdom, affirms the validity of the religious quest.
