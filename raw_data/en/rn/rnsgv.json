I hate Keppra. I hate the way it makes me feel. I'm always tired and grouchy and fidgety. I can't see straight most of the time and my already short-fuse is way way shorter. Has anyone been on Keppra and NOT had bad side effects? Because for the number of people, it seems like most people I've talked to DON'T like it.", "sitename": "Epilepsy Foundation", "date": "2006-09-14", "cleaned_text": "Community Forum Archive Does ANYONE like being on Keppra?Thu, 09/14/2006 - 16:02 [Medication Issues](https://www.epilepsy.com/connect/forum-archive/medication-issues) Comments Re: Does ANYONE being on Keppra? Submitted by caregivers_need_hugs2 on Sat, 2008-11-29 - 13:16 Hey there! Maybe this will offer a spark of Hope... My hubby has been on Keppra for over a year now and hes doing actually very well on it (maybe even longer cant remember when we had to do last med change). I CRINGED when the Doc changed him from Trileptal to the Keppra after he was having break thru seizures on the highest doeses of Trileptal. I was petrified of Keppra becuase its deemed the EVIL DRUG. Anyway, not for him...hes doing excellent on it and hes fine mood wise too. It was only when they added Zonagran to the Keppra he was EVIL and NASTY and it was horrible. He was the most miserable person to ever live with. We took him off Zonagran and up'ed the Keppra to prevent the sieuzre he was having (break thrus) and poof back to normal in a week or so after the Zonagran was taken away. Hes also on Lexapro which is an anti-depressant. So far, hes happy all the time, never really in a bad mood and doing extremely well on the Keppra. Alot of the other meds he was tired all the time. He doesnt seem to be so bad on the Keppra. I know Doc wants to keep him on the Lexapro becuase it is a mood stabilizer so maybe thast why hes doing so well. Hes on a pretty high dose of Keppra too (I think 1750mg a day plus 10mg lexapro). I hope that sheds some light on your question and brings a little hope. Take care! -Diane Hey there!

Submitted by jholley on Sat, 2008-11-29 - 10:15 Compared to that Tegretol I was on for over 24 years I love this Keppra. I started taking Keppra in late August and slowly tapered off the Tegretol. Being on Tegretol for over half my life I tapered off it twice as slow as my doctor recommended. My seizures were under control with Tegretol so I was worried about having seizures again when I stopped the Tegretol. I had to come off Tegretol because it gave me low bone density. Like the other old AEDs it blocks the absorbtion of calcium. It also made my blood count lower than normal. Being off Tegretol for the last 4 weeks my blood count is now normal. My metabolism and energy level have increased with this higher blood count. I ran a 5K race Thanksgiving morning in 19:04. The fastest 5K I ran while on Tegretol was 22:41. Slight drowsiness was the only side effect I got when I first started Keppra. Now that I've adapted to taking 1500mg of Keppra per day, and that I'm off Tegretol, I no longer feel drowsy. I am very grateful I haven't had a seizure yet while taking Keppra alone. Drugs work differently for everyone so keep trying other AEDs if Keppra gives you too many side effects.

Re: Does ANYONE like being on Keppra? Submitted by tonialpha on Sat, 2008-11-29 - 14:17 I was on Tegretol as a test patient a long time ago! I also love to run too. I started to have problems about 5 years ago w./ sodium and calcium problems. I slipped while running down a hill and broke my right fibula and tibia. The ortho. said I had Osteoporosis. I take a medication for the Osteoporosis. He said you are young to have it and you are athletic. He did a study on the rest of my body and I had other parts of my body that were weak too. I am taking calcium w/ vit. D and Magesium too. I also started not being able to clot fast enough. I told the Epileptologist. We need to change. Tegretol is a great drug. He put me on Keppra. It was like sugar water. He put me on 3750 mg along w./ Zonegran. 300 mg. I started to go back running 5 K and I was fine but he noted I was seizing in his office. He said I want to put you in a study similar to Keppra it's Breveracetam. I'm on the open study. I suddenly cannot run it has affecting my muscles. He said that should go away. I can only go a mile. I have frozen shoulder on both shoulders. My ortho. said you are one of my most healthiest patients. Brother! The meds. have decreased my seizures. I will wait one more month. I use the treadmill. He gave me shots for the shoulders which I have been exercising and he said I was like any other athlete trying to fix it myself. I ice it or heat when I have pain. Thanks for letting me write this.
