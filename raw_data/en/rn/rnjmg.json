Recurrent natural disasters, including floods and droughts, have devastated agricultural production already in decline. These circumstances, compounded by the fact that only 14% of North Korean land is arable, have contributed to a very severe situation. Never self-sufficient in food production, and with its land exhausted by poor cultivation practices, the DPRK has lacked the foreign exchange needed to import sufficient amounts of food, fuel, agricultural inputs, and medicine. Aid and trade cut-backs on the part of traditional economic partners Russia and China are major contributors to North Korea's mounting economic problems. Although North Korea has long depended on imports to meet food needs, serious fertilizer shortages in recent years have reduced staple grain output to more than 1 million tons below the country's needs, even to meet minimal demands. The general depression in the North Korean economy since the end of the Cold War is basically responsible for the acute food security situation. North Korea is the world's most centrally planned economy, where agricultural land is collectivized, and state owned industry produces nearly all manufactured goods. Total economic output has fallen steadily since the collapse of North Korea's ties to the Eastern Bloc and former Soviet Union. Combined with serious energy shortages, aging industrial facilities, and a lack of maintenance and new investment, the economy of the DPRK has fallen as much as one-half since 1991. Consequent shortages in fuel, electricity and chemicals have severely undercut industrial production, and exports. The authoritarian nature of the regime, long-standing suspicion of foreigners, and an official policy of self-reliance make the DPRK a very difficult working environment for humanitarian agencies. All contacts with the public are monitored, and a substantial portion of the country is considered off-limits. Americans are particularly suspect, due in part to the continued presence of in upwards of 38,000 US troops along the 38th Parallel and in South Korea, and to the state of war technically still in effect between North Korea and the nations it confronted during the Korean War. American NGOs are unable to maintain a permanent presence in the country and therefore coordinate their activities at the meetings of InterAction's Working Group on North Korea, held most recently in Washington, D.C. on June 14, 2000. Since NGO assistance was initiated in 1995, access to the public has improved. The World Food Program (WFP) has been able to open five offices throughout the country. A consortium of American NGOs received permission to monitor a portion of US food assistance, spending up to five months at a time inside the country for this purpose. In 1998, international agencies were able to conduct a nutritional survey. It left little doubt regarding the gravity of the food crisis. NGOs have seen no evidence that food is being diverted by the government to the military, which has access to both domestic production and Chinese food aid. The nutrition survey conducted by the WFP, UNICEF, and the EU in September 1998 found a high level of stunting, and increased instances of diarrheal diseases. North Korea's weak public health system, unsafe water supply, and poor sanitation conditions have led to the re-emergence of previously controlled diseases and have exacerbated the poor state of health in the country. With sources estimating that nearly 10% of the population has died from hunger or disease since 1995, refugees have fled to China. The US Institute for Peace estimated that at least 100,000 North Koreans have made the dangerous journey across the border with China in the last four years. Those unable to lose themselves among the resident Chinese-Korean population are being forced back to North Korea by the Chinese authorities who do not respect their refugee status. There are also continued reports that North Korean women and girls are being traded for food and money. In April 1999, the US government announced that it would initiate its first program of direct bilateral aid to North Korea, channeling 100,000 MT of food aid through an expanded consortium of American NGOs. (All previous food aid had been routed through the World Food Programme (WFP)). For their part, American NGOs agreed to finance from their own resources a potato seed initiative designed to expand and improve the quality of potato production in the DPRK. In May 1999 InterAction sponsored an NGO Conference on North Korea in Beijing, which was attended by NGOs from America, South Korea, Europe, and Japan. Finally, in June, 2000 a summit was held between the leaders of North and South Korea in order to facilitate an improvement in relations between the two countries and accelerate South Korean aid and involvement. Report Summary This guide offers international agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the media and the public an overview of the humanitarian assistance being provided to the people of North Korea by InterAction member agencies. Eleven InterAction member organizations currently conduct relief and development operations in the DPRK. Six sector areas are addressed in programming including agriculture and food production, disaster and emergency relief, education/training, energy, health care, and human rights and conflict resolution. These humanitarian activities in the DPRK take place in several locations including, but not limited to, Cochang and Yontang counties, the Provinces of North Hwanghae, South Pyong'an, Nampo, and Kangwon, South and North P'yongon, Sinuiju, as well as Pyongyang and its surrounding areas. The NGOs in this report have presented various objectives for their projects in the DPRK. Common themes among program objectives include: addressing health care needs, the establishment of consistent food sources, business and community development, etc. Several NGOs work through the support of or in coordination with local and international partners. Some of the organizations mentioned are: UNICEF, USAID, the German government, the US government, the DPRK Ministry of Public Health, UNHCR, UNWPF, the Mennonite Central Committee, USDA, the World Food Program, the Canadian government, and the Korean Christian Federation.

Box 234 Introduction to ADRA The Adventist Development and Relief Agency International (ADRA) is an independent, humanitarian agency established by the Seventh-day Adventist Church with the specific purpose of individual and community development and disaster relief. Established in 1956, ADRA helps people without regard to age, ethnicity, or political or religious association. ADRA in North Korea ADRA continues to provide relief to famine-affected residents in North Korea with a program to build solar kitchen for cooking, and delivering necessary supplies. The solar kitchens are being installed in various institutions at the request of the North Korean government. ADRA Switzerland is beginning its second phase of constructing and installing solar kitchens for various institutions that host children, including orphanages, hospitals, kindergartens, day-care centers and others. To date, ADRA Switzerland has built and installed 100 of the units, the same number which will be produced in the second phase, doubling the number of solar kitchens in the country. In June 1999, an official branch of ADRA was placed inside North Korean borders to implement the program. The long-term goal of ADRA, through the program agreement with the North Korean government, is to build 1000 solar kitchens. ADRA Switzerland sent over 2 mobile solar kitchen units last year, which are being used by ADRA Project Director Albert Mettler to educate the institutional leaders on how to use the simple units. The units are made of parabolic mirrors that trace the sun during the day and direct it to one spot for utilizing the energy. North Koreans, under the direction of Mettler, manufacture the mirrors. The mirrors are nine square meters per unit, involving one to four units to make a functioning kitchen. ADRA is currently negotiating for more possible projects in the near future and is providing other relief activities in the famine-stricken country. During the past winter, ADRA delivered food, clothing, shoes, and soap, in addition to coal for heating needy orphanages and hospitals in North Korea. ADRA's programs in DPRK fall under the headings of agriculture and food production, disaster and emergency relief, and energy and are aimed at assisting institutions such as schools, orphanages, kindergartens, etc... to cover their energy needs. Other basic needs in these institutions, such as clothes or winterization supplies are also addressed. About 100 project sites are located in Cochang and Yontang Counties, as well as the Province of North Hwanghae and are funded through ADRA's own funds, in addition to the German and US governments. ADRA is a member of the US PVO Consortium in DPRK. Cooperation is active with several local diplomatic representation, especially from Switzerland and Germany. ADRA regularly participates in the weekly meetings of the UN/NGO community in DPRK. American Friends Service Committee US Contact Alice Andrews Asst.

It promotes self-help and independence and the improvement of people's physical, economic and social well-being, out of Quaker concern for reconciliation and the relief of suffering. AFSC focuses on promoting mutual understanding of people. American Friends Service Committee in North Korea American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) provides emergency and development assistance to the DPRK in order to help modernize and increase agricultural production. In cooperation with the Mennonite Central Committee, AFSC is assisting three North Korean cooperative farms with a total population of over 16,000. These farms are in the rice-growing western plains surrounding Pyongyang. Agricultural assistance has included urea and compound fertilizer (1,200 tons in 2000), clear plastic sheeting (over a half-million square meters in 2000) and smaller quantities of herbicide, sprayers, and seed (wheat, corn, potato). In coordination with the North Korean Academy of Agricultural Services (AAS), AFSC has sponsored four study-tours for North Korean agricultural scientists to visit US and Chinese agricultural universities, farms and research centers. AFSC is currently supporting experimentation by the AAS and the farms to test biological sources of nitrogen fertilizer and alternate crop rotations. Through its East Asia Quaker International Affairs Program based in Tokyo, AFSC engages with NGOs in Northeast Asia and seeks to build trust along lines of political division in the region. The program also works to broaden the dialogue between the U.S. and the DPRK. A medical study tour to the U.S. East Coast for North Korean cardiovascular doctors took place in the summer of 1999. Additional study opportunities in medicine and other subjects are being planned. Since 1995, AFSC's contributions of relief food and materials and agricultural supplies to the DPRK have totaled over $1,700,000. Major funding sources other than direct contributions to AFSC include the Mennonite Central Committee, and Evangelische Zentralstelle Fur Entwicklungshilfe EV. General sectors of AFSC activity in the DPRK include: Agriculture and Food Production, Disaster and Emergency Relief, Health Care, and Peace and Conflict Resolution.

Heifer Project International US Contact Rebecca Alderfer P.O. Box 808 Intl. Metropolitan, Pixu, Pixian Sichuan 611731 CHINA Introduction to Heifer Project International Heifer Project International, working in partnership with others, alleviates hunger, poverty and environmental degradation by helping families to become self-sufficient for food and income. HPI development work provides animals, training, and technical assistance to low income families. In addition, HPI provides more than 25 different kinds of food and income-producing animals as well as training in animal husbandry, community development, and in environmentally sound agricultural methods. Heifer Project International in North Korea HPI/China is the representative office of Heifer Project International in China, and is located in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. The Country Director is Prof. Pu Jiabi, and he will be responsible for the local management of this project. The HPI/China office opened in 1987, and has managed many successful projects around the nation. The local partner within North Korea is the Agricultural Commission. They oversee all agricultural and livestock related activities in that country. The actual project site partners are the leaders of the local cooperatives as well as the individual participating families. HPI/China and the Agricultural Commission will coordinate import of animals and any necessary supplies and equipment, as well as the development of the agroforestry components. Local Conditions This represents an opportunity to contribute directly toward peace. Peaceful solutions to the tension on the Korean peninsula can be strengthened through a program of joint cooperation where the farm families of North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea - DPRK) can help themselves because of the sharing and caring of North American and Chinese citizens. Efforts are also being explored to involve US and South Korean churches. The DPRK has suffered successive crop failures in recent years, and has also seen much of its most productive farm land flooded in 1995 and 1996. Food rationing has been severely restricted since the end of 1996, and most adults in the nation, as of spring 1997, were receiving a daily ration of only 100 to 150 grams (no more than a quarter pound) of rice or starch equivalent. This is far below the amount required simply for maintenance of adult weight, let alone health, and does not account for those performing heavy labor. There is an urgent and important need for simultaneously addressing the famine in the DPRK as well as assisting them in altering their policies of food production. Sustainable systems need to be developed and implemented now, to reduce the chances for future famines. A great opportunity exists at this time in North Korea's history for Heifer Project to have the type of influence on that nation's sustainable food production and food production policies, to the degree that HPI permanently influenced Tanzania, India and other countries in decades past. The Director of North Korea's Agricultural Commission stated to the Asia/South Pacific Director of HPI in February 1997, after learning about what HPI is and can do, that it could have a major influence on the restructuring of the entire nation's agricultural policies. The government stated it would allow individual ownership of animals to an unprecedented degree should HPI decide to assist them. A feasibility study done in February by the Asia/South Pacific Director, a veterinarian, was followed up by the HPI/China Country Director, an expert in animal breeding and development. They have identified with the cooperative leaders, individual farm families, and national agricultural leaders, a program to address North Korea's long term sustainable food production needs. This will lay a foundation for long-term food security for many families, and will become a model for what others can do throughout the country. Objectives HPI aims to contribute positively and directing toward a peaceful solution to the tension on the Korean peninsula, while significantly effect the agricultural/food production policies of the country through developing an effective model of animal agriculture. In addition, HPI hopes to improve the nutrition of participating families through improved and varied diets including food of animal origin, distribute 300 dairy goats to at least 150 families, 1,000 rabbits to 100 families, and 3,000 chickens to 300 families, provide 100 dairy goats to the cooperative farm for maintaining a pure and high quality line of goats as an overall resource to the cooperative and the families, provide initial and then ongoing training to all participating families in rearing their animals, and using them properly for contributing to the home and garden, enhance the local environment through the provision and planting of locally appropriate trees, shrubs and pasture grasses and legumes, and strengthen the understanding between the people of North Korea, the United States and the People's Republic of China. Activities The overall aims of this project are to increase the food security of participating families, and to develop a model of food production/animal agriculture useful for other parts of the country. Leadership, management and training will be sensitive to gender and age issues. Efforts are being made to incorporate the inputs and utilize the knowledge and skills of all members of the families and cooperative leadership as well. Agroforestry practices will be implemented as they will enhance the soil quality, reduce and eventually eliminate erosion, provide feed and fodder for the animals, produce wood and other forest products for home and cooperative use, and become a source of regenerative income. Trees and shrubs that are appropriate to the region will be planted in selected areas within the cooperatives. Dairy goats will be distributed to the participating families at two per family. Dairy goats will be selected from regional Asian stock that have at least half European blood, such as Saanen, and can produce at least 300 kg of milk per lactation. Families which receive rabbits will receive ten (at a ratio of one buck to four does). Rabbits will be either Californian or New Zealand breed, and will be from Asian stock, already adapted to the region. Poultry will be one of several local multipurpose types, and will be distributed in units of ten per family (nine hens and one rooster). The 100 dairy goats which are raised by the cooperatives themselves will be managed in larger units, and will have full-time staff caring for them. The cooperative management will focus on keeping the overall quality of the imported dairy goats at a high level, so as to reduce the need for further imported goats in these areas. A local facilitator will be hired on a part-time basis who will represent HPI's interests in North Korea for the duration of this project. Training Training is integral to the long term development of sustainable food production systems in the country. Training in this project will begin at the local level, with the two partner cooperatives. Training will be provided before animals are delivered, and again during receipt of the animals. Ongoing training and technical assistance will be extended to the participating families, as well as those due to receive Pass On animals. Specific training issues will include general animal management, selecting and breeding, feeds and feeding, milking, uses of manure, and health care. Human nutrition from animal products will be covered by local and international experts and will be imparted to both husbands and wives as well as the older youth. Local personnel will be trained to be extension workers specifically for this project, and will be backed up by the managing group of this overall project. Training for specific leaders, including those from the Agricultural Commission as well as the cooperatives will also be given in China, by the HPI/China team. This will include site visits to HPI/China projects involving poultry, goats and rabbits, as well as to government-run, cooperative-run, and association-run projects. Specific training will be imparted to leaders of the project, as well as farm families, in HPI's CORNERSTONES for sustainable development. Everyone who receives an animal will pass on to someone else something of equal value to what they received themselves. If they received goats and rabbits, they will pass on live animals; if they received poultry, they will pass on cash. Thus, through microcredit (an animal or cash for an animal), all animal recipients will repay to their project group the credit they received plus any increase in the value of their animals, so that it can pass on additional animals to neighbors.

UMCOR works with partner agencies including the World Food Program and the Korean Christian Federation. US Fund for UNICEF US Contact Guy Taylor U.S. Fund for UNICEF 333 E. 38th St. NY, 850 2 381 7150 Fax:850 2 381 7676 Introduction to US Fund for UNICEF The US Fund for UNICEF works for the survival, protection and development of children worldwide through education, advocacy, and fund-raising. UNICEF in North Korea Through a generous donation from the government of Canada, a nationwide vitamin A campaign took place between 12 to 16 May 2000. More than 2.1 million children under five, including 430,000 under 11 months, were provided with the supplementation throughout the country's 6500 hospitals and clinics. The Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and UNICEF conducted joint monitoring visits to observe the campaign in five provinces. The second vitamin A campaign for 2000 will be combined with National Immunization Days in November. Despite severe electricity shortages, the cold chain was enhanced with the provision of transport, such as pickups and bicycles, which are to be used by anti-epidemic stations to deliver vaccines from central provincial cold rooms to the targeted health institutions at the lower levels. A five-day intensive training session, held between 22 and 26 May, was attended by some 40 provincial representatives from the country's 13 anti-epidemic stations. The session primarily focused on EPI management, cold chain procedures, side effects and differences between UNICEF-assisted and DPRK vaccines, Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance, and reporting system. These trainees are expected to further impart knowledge to the health providers at the lower levels. UNICEF support for EPI is making a difference. The graph shows a dramatic increase in immunization coverage through various vaccines from 1998 to 1999. Over 4600 medical kits are currently being distributed to the 98 counties, reaching approximately 12 million people. These kits will cover essential drugs requirements for the next six months for treating common childhood diseases such as acute respiratory infections and skin diseases. Selection of these vital medicines from the WHO/UNICEF essential drugs list was mainly focused on drugs suitable for children and mothers. For the first time, the imported medical kits do not include Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS), since the Pyongyang ORS factory supported by UNICEF is now able to provide the full requirements of 2.2 million sachets for the country. To improve rational drug use, a second edition of the drug and treatment manual is being printed through collaborative efforts of UNICEF, IFRC, WHO and the MoPH. Twenty thousand copies will be distributed nationwide. Other vital supplies currently being distributed include 250 tons of high-energy milk for the treatment of severely malnourished children. Targeted institutions that provide rehabilitation support for malnourished children include baby homes throughout the country, and pediatric and county hospitals in the UNICEF-designated areas. Over 500 tons of calcium hypochlorite are also being distributed to the provincial and county water treatment stations to make water safe for drinking. From past experience, the need for technical assistance and contemporary knowledge has not always been recognized by DPRK policy makers. It was therefore a positive development, when information-sharing activities such as the provision of medical textbooks and international professional journals was especially appreciated by counterparts. The first set of such publications has been provided to the Grand People's Study House in Pyongyang. Selected texts will be translated and disseminated to the provincial health centers by the MoPH. The Government has requested UNICEF to further extend this activity to other sectors. Study visits to China and Thailand to strengthen national capacity in the design, management and monitoring of water and environmental sanitation activities are under preparation. Support for capacity development in good manufacturing practices (GMP) is also being provided to the Pyongyang Pharmaceutical Factory to effectively upgrade production capacity of key essential drugs through in-country training. Strong collaboration continues with WFP with Food-For-Work schemes for the rehabilitation of DPRK's main salt plant and local production of complementary foods like corn soya blend and high-energy biscuits. A further five activities are being developed with the government and WFP. New initiatives include rehabilitation of maternity hospitals, production of toys and school furniture, rehabilitation of heating systems in hospitals and schools, and construction of sanitary latrines. The current emergency program is fully complemented by a normal program of cooperation. UNICEF and the government have recently completed its planning exercise for a short duration program in harmonization with other UN agencies for 2001-2003. To address the most urgent needs of children and women in the most underserved areas of DPRK, UNICEF requires the implementation of the following three projects: Integrated health: this project consists of integrated set of activities in health, including EPI, safe motherhood, essential drugs and Acute Respiratory Infection/Control of Diarrheal Disease (ARI/CDD). It targets approximately 2.1 million vulnerable children and 540,000 women in selected geographical areas. Objectives include the control of disease outbreaks such as polio and measles through expanded programs of immunization, prevention and treatment of common childhood diseases (through provision of essential drugs and case management of ARI/CDD) and safe motherhood activities to improve maternal wellbeing.
