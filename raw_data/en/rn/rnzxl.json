For empirically-relevant degrees of price rigidity, the optimal annual long-run inflation rate is in the range of half a percent to 2 percent, depending on whether it is TFP risk or markup risk or both t hat is the source of uncertainty in the economy. Positive inflation is a result of precautionary behavior on the part of the central bank in expectations for adverse shocks. By setting a posit ive inflation rate on average, monetary policy mitigates the effects of potential adverse sho cks on the economy through easing the collateral constraints. In particular, the frequency at whi ch the collateral constraint binds under optimal policy is substantially lower compared to the fr equency at which the constraint binds when the monetary policy maker commits to zero-inflation polic y. The results of this paper are also in line with basic Ramsey literature regarding smoothing distortions over time. In this case smoothing distortions requires deviations from the zero-inflati on rate prescription which is a cornerstone result in the standard New Keynesian model. Part II: \"Optimal Monetary Policy and Downward Nominal Wage Rigidity in Frictional Labor Markets\" Empirical evidence suggests that nom inal wages in the U.S. are downwardly rigid. This paper studies the optimal long-run inflation rate in a labor search and matching framework under the presence of Downward Nominal Wage Rigidity (DNWR). In this environment, optimal monetary policy targets a positive inflation rate; the annual long-run inflation rate for the U.S. is around 2 percent. Positive inflation \"greases the wheels\" of the labor market by facilitating real wage adjustments, and hence it eases job creation an d prevents excessive increase in unemployment following recessionary shocks. These findings are related to standard Ramsey theory of \"wedge smoothing\"; by following a positive -inflation policy under sticky prices, the monetary authority manages to reduce the volatility and the size of the intertemporal distortion significantly. The intertemporal wedge is completely smoothed when prices are fully flexible. Since the optimal long-run inflation rate predicted by this stud y is considerably higher than in otherwise neoclassical labor markets, the nature of the labor market in which DNWR is studied can be relevant for policy recommendations. Part III: \"Sticky Wages, Incomplete Pass -Through and Inflation Targeting: What is the Right Index to Target?\" This paper studies strict monetary policy rules in a small open economy with Inflation Targeting, incomplete pass-through and rigi d nominal wages. The paper shows that, when nominal wages are fully flexible and pass-through is low to moderate, the monetary authority should target the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rather than the Dome stic Price Index (DPI). When pass-through is high, an economy with high degrees of nominal wage rigidity and wage indexation should either target the CPI or fully stabilize nominal wages. These results suggest that, by committing to a common monetary policy in a common-currency ar ea, some countries may not be following the right monetary policy rules.

Hellerstein University of Maryland hellerst@econ.umd.edu (301) 405-3545 Prof. Raymond In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) was signed into law, expanding the Medicare program to include insurance coverage for prescription drugs. This program, known as Part D, was not implemented until 2006. Given this two- year lag in implementation, anticipation of the permanent future price change brought about by subsidized coverage may have induced forward-looking individuals to change their drug spending /g69/g72/g73/g82/g85/g72 Part D took effect. This pre-reform utilization response is theoretically ambiguous due to opposing income and inter- temporal substitution effects. In this paper, I estimate the causal utilization response to the announcement of Part D in 2003 using data from the MCBS and MEPS. This contrasts with previous evaluations of Part D, and of drug co-insurance changes more broadly, that have estimated only contemporaneous utilization effects, thus implicitly assuming a myopic policy response. My main empirical approach identifies whether there was a causal anticipatory response by comparing utilization of chronic drugs relative to acute drugs before and after the announcement. Given that acute drugs treat illnesses that are largely unpredictable and short in duration, their demand is predicted to respond only to current prices, whereas chronic drug use may respond negatively or positively to anticipated future price reductions. I find evidence of a large negative announcement effect in the aggregate. Chronic drug use declined by nearly 7 percent relative to acute drug use after the announcement providing evidence of forward-looking demand for drugs and a dominating inter-temporal substitution effect. This effect is concentrated among elderly with below-median incomes and the youngest Medicare beneficiaries, for whom the costs of delaying treatment are lowest. After accounting for this negative anticipatory response, I find a total treatment effect on utilization in the first year of the program that is substantially smaller than if anticipation effects are ignored. /g179/g51/g72/g85/g89/g72/g85/g86/g72/g3/g53/g72/g89/g72/g85/g86/g72/g3/g51/g85/g76/g70/g72/g3/g38/g82/g80/g83/g72/g87/g76/g87/g76/g82/g81/g29/g3/g36/g89/g72/g85/g68/g74/g72/g3/g58/g75/g82/g79/g72/g86/g68/g79/g72/g3/g51/g85/g76/g70/g72/g86/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g48/g72/g71/g76/g70/g68/g76/g71/g3/g51/g75/g68/g85/g80/g68/g70/g72/g88/g87/g76/g70/g68/g79/g3 /g54/g83/g72/g81/g71/g76/g81/g74/g180 (with Mark Duggan and Judith K. Hellerstein) [Work in Progress] Generic drugs comprise an increasing share of total prescriptions dispensed in the US, rising from 47 percent in 2000 to 63 percent in 2007. The generic drug market has typically been viewed as a mostly competitive market with price approaching marginal costs. However, the large presence of third party payers as final purchasers may distort prices and market shares relative to what a standard model of price competition would predict. In this paper, we investigate how generic drug producers compete in the presence of the third-party reimbursement rules of the Medicaid program. Medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies, like that of other payers, is based on a benchmark price called the average wholesale price (AWP), which is published in several pricing catalogues. This list price is reported by generic producers themselves, and until recently has been subject to essentially no independent verification. As a result, generic producers have had an incentive to compete for pharmacy market share by reporting AWPs that are much greater than actual average prices, as this \"spread\" leads to larger pharmacy profits. In 2000, after a federal government audit of actual wholesale prices of generic products, states were advised to reduce Medicaid reimbursement by as much as 95% for 400 generic and off-patent injectable, infusion, and inhalation drug products. We use variation induced by the timing of this policy along with its differential impact on drug products and states to identify the impact of this exogenous price change on the market share of affected products. Our findings indicate that pharmacies respond to the perverse incentives of the Medicaid program by stocking products with the highest AWPs.

Job market paper Credit constraints lin king debt to mar ket-determined prices embody a systemic credit externality that drives a wedge between competitive and constrained socially optimal equilibria, inducing private agents to \"overborrow.\" This externality arises because private agents fail to internalize the financial amplification effects of carrying a large amount of debt when credit constraints bind. I conduct a quantitative analysis of this externality in a two- sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of a small open economy calibrated to emerging mark ets. Raising the cost of borrowing during tranquil times restores constrained efficiency and significantly reduces the incidence and severity of financial crises. Part II: Overborrowing, Financial Crises and `Macro-prudential' Taxes. (with Enrique Mendoza) This paper studies overborrowing and financial crises in an equilibrium model of business cycles and asset prices with collateral co nstraints. Private agents in a decentralized competitive equilibrium do not internalize the effects of their individual borrowing plans on the mar ket price of assets at which collateral is valued and on the wage costs relevant for working capital financing. Quantitatively, average debt and leverage ratios are only slightly larger in the competitive equilibrium, but the incidence and magnitude of financial crises is much larger. We examine the implications for asset pricing properties finding that excess asset returns, Sharpe ratios and the mar ket price of ris k also become much larger. Part III: Efficient Bailouts? Financial crises typically lead to bailouts of the financial sector. A common argument for these bailouts is that they help to mitigate the credit crunch that accompanies financial crises. The anticipation of future bailouts, however, distorts ex-ante incentives encouraging the financial sector to ta ke excessive risk. I study these effects in a dy namic stochastic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents. The focus is on ma king a quantitative assessment of the positive and welfare implications of bailouts of the financial sector.

Whereas advocates argue that private firms are more efficient providers than public managers, opponents maintain that private firms reduce non-con tractible quality. This paper evaluates the causal impact on academic achievement of contracting out pub lic schools to private oper ators. The Colegios en Concesion (CEC) program is a large-scale initiative im plemented in 2000 in B ogot\\'a, Colombia, that contracted out all new public schools to well reputed private schools and universities. This program allowed CEC schools to operate outsid e the collective bargaining provisions of traditional public schools in return for higher accountability, including test-b ased accountability. To overco me potential selection bias of students into CEC sc hools, this paper exploits variation in distance from a student's residence to the closest CEC institution as an instrument for CEC attendance. While distance may in theory be correlated with unobservable characteristics of stude nts, I demonstrate using a variety of empirical strategies that this instrument is conditionally ex ogenous of unobserved determinants of academic achievement. The two-stage least sq uares estimates obtained indicate th at CEC students' score 0.6 and 0.2 standard deviations high er in math and verbal tests, respectivel y, relative to public school students. I also provide evidence that the estimated results are not driven by unintended strategic responses by CEC schools, such as the exclusion of low-performing students from the p ool of test-takers or via test specialization in the curriculum. The CEC program provi des evidence in favor of the theoretical case for private provision of public education through a gove rnance structure that, in addition to contractually demand academic performance prevents schools from undertaking quality-shading cost reductions by granting contracts to non-profit organiza tions with strong reputational motives. Part II: Longer-Term Educational Consequences of Increased Public School Accountability: Evidence from Administrative Records in Colombia. [Work in Progress] In Chapter 1 of the dissertation, I provide evidence that attending contracted out public schools raises student test scores. However, these results do not necessa rily translate into longer-run gains in potentially more meaningful outcomes such as increasing the pr obability of investing in post-secondary schooling, attending a more selective tertiary institution, or being admitted in high-return academic programs. Using the empirical strategy developed in Chapter 1, I exam ine some long-run effects of the CEC public school accountability program in Bogota using administrative data on college level en rollment (2- and 4-year programs), major choice, and co llege academic performance.

In a two- sided experiment, \"taxpayer\" subjects voluntarily report their income and decide whether to make an observable and verifiable donation to a charity; \"auditor\" subjects choose which taxpayers to audit based on reported information. Our theoretical results indicate that the availability of a charitable donation option in a tax compliance framework should have no impact on tax compliance behavior among standard utility maximizing individuals. However, when auditing of taxpayer reports is endogenously determined, rational utility maximizers may donate to charity in equilibrium when they otherwise would not in order to signal \"honesty,\" thereby reducing the probability of audit. We provide experimental evidence to support our theoretical results. /g179/g38/g82/g80/g83/g72/g87/g76/g87/g76/g82/g81/g3/g76/g81/g3/g87/g75/g72/g3/g38/g76/g87/g92/g29/g3/g40/g91/g83/g72/g85/g76/g80/g72/g81/g87/g68/g79/g3/g40/g89/g76/g71/g72/g81/g70/g72/g3/g73/g85/g82/g80/g3/g53/g88/g85/g68/g79/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g56/g85/g69/g68/g81/g3/g42/g75/g68/g81/g68/g180/g3 (with Erkut Ozbay) With disparate rural and urban development outcomes in many African countries there is growing policy interest in promoting entrepreneurship. If preferences for competition vary by rural and urban areas, entrepreneurship programs may not take hold in populations that tend to shy away from competitive and uncertain economic opportunities, thus contributing to the systematic underdevelopment of rural areas. In a field experiment conducted among potential entrepreneurs in rural and urban Ghana, I find that rural participants were 18 percent less likely than their urban counterparts to select an all-or-nothing tournament compensation scheme over a piece rate wage when performing a simple matching task. The difference between the rural and urban tournament choice was driven by participants whose performance ranked in the second quartile within their rural or urban group; urban participants in the second quartile were three times more likely to choose the tournament than rural participants in the second quartile. While I observed no signs of participant overconfidence across groups, rural participants were consistently underconfident whereas urban participants were not. /g51/g40/g53/g54/g50/g49/g36/g47/g3/g44/g49/g41/g50/g53/g48/g36/g55/g44/g50/g49/g3 Citizenship: U.S. Gender: Languages: Portuguese and French CAROLINA GONZ\u00c1LEZ -VELOSA 4331 Rowalt Drive, Email: gonzalez-velosa@econ.umd.edu Website: http://econweb.umd.edu/~gonzalez-velosa EDUCATION Ph.D. Economics, University of Maryland at College Park, expected May 2011 M.A. Economics, New York University (Terminal Program), New York, May 2006 B.A. Economics, Universidad de los Andes, Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, June 2000 DISSERTATION \"Essays on Migration and Agricultural Development\" Committee: Prof. Jeanne Lafortune (Chair), Prof. Judith Hellerstein, Prof. Maureen Cropper FIELDS OF SPECIALIZATION Primary: Development Economics, Labor Economics Secondary: Applied Microeconomics PAPERS \"The Effects of Emigration and Remittances on Agriculture: Evidence from the Philippines \" Job Market Paper \"More Hands, More Power?

By altering factor endowments and providing a risk-mitigating device, emigration and remittances may lead to a decline in the relative size of agriculture and facilitate agricultural modernization. This paper investigates the impact of remittances and emigration on agricultural production in the Philippines, one of the largest exporters of migrants in the world. I estimate province-level effects of emigr ation and remittances on the size of the Philippines' agricultural sector and the degree of mechanization and specialization in farming. I use a double-instrumentation strategy that exploits macroeconomic shocks at the migrant's predicted destinations in order to identify separately the effects of migration and remittanc es. The results suggest that neither emigration nor remittances have impacted the size of agriculture: there is no evidence of effects on number of farms, farmed area and labor input allocation. Remittances appear to increase the fraction of rice farms that use capital-intensive technologies and decrease the fraction of farms that engage in crop diversification. Emigration, on the other hand, has little overall impact on agricultural production decisions. These asymmetric impacts are consistent with an economy that has a well-functioning labor market but has capital and insurance constraints. Part II: \"More Hands, More Power? The Impact of Immigration on US Farming and Agricultural Technologies in the Early 20 thCentury\" [with Jeanne Lafortune and Jos\u00e9 Tessada] How do production and technolog y adoption respond to the availability or the price of complementary factors? This paper examines this qu estion in the context of US agriculture in the first three decades of the 20th century by studying the responses of the agricultural sector to immigration flows at the local level. Using the lo cation of past immigrants as instrument for the location choice of new immigrants, we estimate the impact of an increase in the number of farm workers on capital intensity and technology adoption in agriculture at the county level. We find that larger immigrant flows led to slower adop tion of labor-saving technologies (such as draft power), a shift towards more labor-intensive cr ops, and to smaller plots more often farmed by renters than owners. At the same time, an increase in the number of immigrants in a county led the farms to be less capital intensive, as there is an observed decline in capital-labor ratios. These results are robust to controls for scale, crop mix and state-level time trends. Overall, our results indicate that while output mix and technology adoption did respond to the labor influx of capital, some of the adjustment was made through changes in factor intensities for a given crop mix, thus suggesting some degree of adjustment in factor prices.

Policy uncertainty can delay investment and reduce the marginal response to policy change. I provide theoretical and novel quantitative evidence for this channel by focusing on trade policy, a ubiquitous but often overlooked source of uncertainty when a firm's cost of export market entry is sunk. While an explicit pur pose of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and preferential trade agreements (PTAs) is to secure long term market access, little theoretical and empirical work analyzes the implicit value of these arrangements to reduce uncertainty for prospective exporters. Within a tractable model of trade policy uncertainty, I show that exporters will delay entry into new markets and react less responsively to applied tariff reductions. Policy instruments that reduce or eliminate uncertain ty such as PTAs or binding trade policy commitments at the WTO can increase entry even when applied protection is unchanged. I test the model using a disaggregated and detailed dataset of product level Australian imports for 2002-2006. I use the variation in tariffs and PTA im plementation across countries, products and time, to construct measures of uncertainty giv en by the model. The estimates indicate PTAs reduce the probability of policy reversals and that WTO commitments limit the worst case policy shocks. Reducing trade policy uncertainty is up to 4 times more quantitatively important than tariff reductions alone. These results illuminate and quantify an important new channel for trade creation in the world trade system. Part II. \"Trade and Investment under Policy Uncertainty: Theory and Firm Evidence \" We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that trade policy uncertainty can significantly affect investment and entry into export mark ets. When market entry costs are sunk, policy uncertainty can create a real option value of waiting to enter foreign markets until conditions improve or uncertainty is resolved. Using a dynam ic, heterogeneous firms model we show that: (i) investment and entry into export markets is reduced when trade policy is uncertain, and (ii) preferential trade agreements (PTA s) are valuable to exporters even if applied trade barriers are currently low or zero. We derive a structural equation that predicts how firm entry responds to changes in applied tariffs and a theory-based me asure of policy uncertainty. We test our predictions using Portugal's accession to the European Community in 1986 with new firm-level trade data. Our estimates indicate that the accession removed uncertainty about future preferences and this channel lead to substantial investment and entry of Portuguese exporters into EC markets. We argue that these results have broader implications for many other PTAs that aim to secure pre-existing preferences and that our appr oach can also be applied to analyze other sources of policy uncertainty. /g39/g36/g49/g44/g40/g47/g3/g43/g40/g53/g49/g36/g44/g61/g3 7025 Strathmore Street, Apt.

This raises the question of whether or not micro price flexibility translates into macro neutrality to monetary shocks. This paper introduces price promotions in a monetary DSGE model where consumers differ in their price sensitivity and look for promotions, and where firms choose their regular and promotional prices as well as the frequency of promotions. Under this setting, regular and promotional prices coexist, and promotional prices provide a new source of price flexibility. After allowing for Calvo-stickiness in regular prices, individual price series behave in a way consistent with empirical findings: regular prices are sticky, prices including sales change very frequently, and realized prices show rigidity in the form of inertia in reference prices around which weekly prices revolve. As a result of the flexibility introduced by promotional prices, the economy displays near neutrality with respect to monetary policy shocks. This result contrasts with the one obtained by similar studies using alternative rationales for promotions, showing the importance of further exploration on the design of firm-customer interactions in macroeconomic models. /g51/g40/g53/g54/g50/g49/g36/g47/g3/g44/g49/g41/g50/g53/g48/g36/g55/g44/g50/g49 Citizenship: Bolivia Languages: at College Park, Expected May 2010 M.A. Economics, Univ. of Maryland at College Park, December 2008 B.S.

It is widely assumed that as income increases, social comparison and adaptation contribute to higher income aspirations, which in turn mitigate the effect of income increases on life satisfaction. This process is believed to be the cause behind the flat relationship in time between income and happiness in industrialized countries. On the other hand, studies on transition countries show that life satisfaction has increased in time parallel to real income, especially during the early years of transition, indicating that in these countries the response patterns of life satisfaction are significantly different from those in industrialized countries. This paper first explores the channels through which adaptation and social comparison contribute to higher income aspirations. The results show that social comparison is a strong agent in shaping aspirations, while the effect of adaptation is relatively weak. Subsequently, the paper tests for the effect of aspirations on two separate satisfaction indices, satisfaction with life and satisfaction with economic conditions. The paper uses a Chamberlain random-effects ordered probit estimation to control for time-invariant unobservable individual traits. In contrast to previous studies, the results suggest that increases in aspirations have a positive effect on life satisfaction. This paper argues that this is caused by the expectations contained in income aspirations. Higher aspirations reflect an increase in needs commensurate to changes in own and others' income, but they also reflect improved income expectations based on the information provided by the present income of relevant others. The improved outlook embedded in the higher income aspirations causes the latter to have a pos itive effect on life satisfaction. This suggests that, ten years into the transition process, the reaction patterns of life satisfaction in Russia differ substantially from those in developed countries. /g47/g36/g49/g42/g56/g36/g42/g40/g54/g3 Albanian (native), English (fluent), Turkish (fluent), Italian (fluent), French (advanced), Spanish (basic) /g51/g53/g50/g42/g53/g36/g48/g54/g3 Excel, Stata, E-views /g39/g36/g55/g36/g37/g36/g54/g40/g54/g3 Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, Haver Analyt World Outlook, International Financial University of Maryland at College Park, expected Summer 2011 M.A. Economics, Seoul National University, 2000 B.A. Economics, Seoul National University, 1998 /g39/g44/g54/g54/g40/g53/g55/g36/g55/g44/g50/g49/g3 /g51/g68/g85/g87/g3/g44/g17/g3/g179/g55/g75/g72/g3/g53/g72/g79/g68/g87/g76/g82/g81/g3/g69/g72/g87/g90/g72/g72/g81/g3/g38/g82/g88/g81/g87/g85/g92/g3/g53/g76/g86/g78/g3/g51/g85/g72/g80/g76/g88/g80/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g53/g72/g68/g79/g3/g40/g91/g70/g75/g68/g81/g74/g72/g3/g53/g68/g87/g72/g3/g88/g81/g71/g72/g85/g3/g89/g68/g85/g76/g82/g88/g86/g3/g41/g59/g3 /g85/g72/g74/g76/g80/g72/g86/g180/g3 /g51/g68/g85/g87/g3/g44/g44/g17/g3/g179/g55/g75/g72/g3/g44/g80/g83/g68/g70/g87/g3/g82/g73/g3/g48/g68/g70/g85/g82/g72/g70/g82/g81/g82/g80/g76/g70/g3/g36/g81/g81/g82/g88/g81/g70/g72/g80/g72/g81/g87/g3/g82/g81/g3/g53/g72/g68/g79/g3/g55/g76/g80/g72/g3/g41/g82/g85/g72/g76/g74/g81/g3/g40/g91/g70/g75/g68/g81/g74/g72/g3/g53/g68/g87/g72/g3/g76/g81/g3 /g40/g80/g72/g85/g74/g76/g81/g74/g3/g48/g68/g85/g78/g72/g87/g86/g180/g3 /g51/g36/g51/g40/g53/g54/g3 \"The Relation between Country Risk Premium and Real Exchange Rate under various FX regimes,\" Job Market Paper \"The Impact of Macroeconomic Announcement on Real Time Foreign Exchange Rate in Emerging Markets,\" (with Fang Cai and Zhiwei Zhang), International Finance Discussion Papers (973), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 2009.

I find out that the correlation of risk premium changes and real exchange rate is bigger under the flexible regime than fixed regime while previous works concentrate on the level of risk premium and welfare implications only. I analyze this problem with the friction in the asset market where only a fraction of agents participate in asset market transaction and using bonus as a risk pooling tool intertemporally. Under this friction, the increase of world interest rate positively affects on the consumption of foreign asset holders due to the wealth effects, and transferred into non-asset holders via monetary channel under the fixed regime. However, the monetary channel is disconnected under flexible regime where government intervenes money supply, and risk pooling effect of a bonus is nullified. As a result, the correlation between the change of risk premium and that of real exchange rate is lower under the fixed regime as well as the level of risk premium itself. Compared with flexible regime where government adopts inflation target, the correlation is smaller, but still lower under fixed regime. Finally, I show that the welfare level under fixed regime is higher than under flexible regimes. /g51/g68/g85/g87/g3/g44/g44/g17/g3/g179/g55/g75/g72/g3/g44/g80/g83/g68/g70/g87/g3/g82/g73/g3/g48/g68/g70/g85/g82/g72/g70/g82/g81/g82/g80/g76/g70/g3/g36/g81/g81/g82/g88/g81/g70/g72/g80/g72/g81/g87/g3/g82/g81/g3/g53/g72/g68/g79/g3/g55/g76/g80/g72/g3/g41/g82/g85/g72/g76/g74/g81/g3/g40/g91/g70/g75/g68/g81/g74/g72/g3/g53/g68/g87/g72/g3/g76/g81/g3 /g40/g80/g72/g85/g74/g76/g81/g74/g3/g48/g68/g85/g78/g72/g87/g86/g180/g3 This paper utilizes a unique high-frequency database to measure how exchange rates in nine emerging markets react to macroeconomic news in the U.S. and domestic economies from 2000 to 2006. We find that major U.S. macroeconomic news have a strong impact on the returns and volatilities of emerging market exchange rates, but many domestic news do not. Emerging market currencies have become more sensitive to U.S. news in recent years. We also find that market sentiment could sway the impact of news on these currencies systematically, as good (bad) news seems to matter more when optimism (pessimism) prevails. Market uncertainty also interacts with macroeconomic news in a statistically significant way, but its role varies across currencies and news. /g3 /g51/g40/g53/g54/g50/g49/g36/g47/g3/g44/g49/g41/g50/g53/g48/g36/g55/g44/g50/g49/g3 /g3 Nationality: Korean (J-1 of Economics University of Maryland, College Park, College Park, MD 20742 Mobile: 301 613 5614 E-mail: lara@econ.umd.edu Website: www.econ.umd.edu/~lara /g40/g39/g56/g38/g36/g55/g44/g50/g49/g3 Ph.

The paper contributes empirical evidence to the debate about whether preferential tax treatment is an effective policy tool to encourage household savings. The empirical strategy of the paper is a difference-in-difference approach that utilizesan arguably exogenous change in access to tax free accounts for a well-defined set of workers. The data provide evidence of heterogeneous effects across demographic subgroups and across quantiles of the savings distribution that accord with predictions of a standard model of savings behavior. In particular, the data show an increase in the savings rate of treated workers in the year following the introduction of the accounts. The effect is driven by prime age workers and by high income workers. Among prime age workers, the lower savers experience the largest effects of the policy change. I perform multiple robustness checks on these findings, including propensity score matching models and tests for potential confounding factors such as changes in retirement accounts' returns or fees, or changes in workers' income. /g51/g68/g85/g87/g3/g44/g44/g29/g3/g179/g44/g81/g73/g82/g85/g80/g68/g87/g76/g82/g81/g3/g73/g85/g68/g80/g76/g81/g74/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g85/g72/g87/g76/g85/g72/g80/g72/g81/g87/g3/g80/g68/g81/g68/g74/g72/g80/g72/g81/g87/g3/g71/g72/g70/g76/g86/g76/g82/g81/g86/g17/g3/g36/g81/g3/g72/g91/g83/g72/g85/g76/g80/g72/g81/g87/g68/g79/g3/g86/g87/g88/g71/g92/g3/g73/g85/g82/g80/g3 /g48/g72/g91/g76/g70/g82/g180/g3 I analyze whether the framing of information about the performance of Pension Funds Administrators affects the retirement management decisions of Mexican workers. I conduct a survey to collect information on recommendations for Fund Administrator choice made by Mexican workers when faced with randomly framed scenarios. The scenarios feature framingbased on choice avoidance and framing exploiting loss aversion. These features have not been used previously in the retirement management literature. /g51/g40/g53/g54/g50/g49/g36/g47/g3/g44/g49/g41/g50/g53/g48/g36/g55/g44/g50/g49/g3 Citizenship: Mexican (F-1 Visa) Gender: Male Languages: Spanish (native), English (advanced), French (basic)XUE LI 4307 Rowalt Drive, Apt. 103 Email: li-x@econ.umd.edu Website: www.econ.umd.edu/~li-x EDUCATION Ph.D. Economics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, expected May 2011 M.A. Economics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, December 2 007 M.A. Economics, Peking University, Beijing, China, 2004 B.A. International Economics, Nankai University, Tianjin, China, 2001 DISSERTATION Part I. \"Why Is the Sex Ratio Unbala nced in Chi na?

The Role of the One-Child Policy, Underdeveloped Social Insurance and Parental Expectations \" (Job Market Paper) The gender imbalance in China has reached such alarming levels that, by 2 020, men of marriageable age are estimated to outnumber women by 30 million. This paper develops a calibrated overlapping generational model to examine this rising sex ratio by sorting out three perspectives in tandem: the one-child policy, the social insurance program and parental expectation. I apply a dynamic fertility choice framework in which family planning policies impose the fertility quota and define the decision making structure. Couples when making fertility choices, including whether to \"abort-and-reconceive,\" are motivated by better returns to investing in a son than in a daughter, with and without social insurance. I also consider the largely overlooked question of expected sex imbalances on current fertility choices. In particular, the increased chance that a son may not be able to marry when there is a significant surplus of males may reduce a preference for sons for altruistic reasons. The benchmark calibrations demonstrate that moving to a one-and-half-child policy (second allowed if the first is a girl) would dramatically decrease the sex ratio at birth by 10-26%. If parents are adaptive and take the \"can-not-marry\" risk into consideration then the sex ratio will drop by around 9-20% under the one-child policy. The model also predicts that the sex ratio changes by only a small amount when social insurance is universal, which suggests that most son preference occurs for cultural/dynastic reasons, not because sons are a substitute for an underdeveloped social insurance system. The comparative statics results under heterogeneous incomes and alternative parameter settings confirm that the model captures the cross-sectional distribution of fertility choices reasonably well. I also investigate the equilibrium sex ratio when couples are fully rational and forward-looking. Comparison between the steady state and current level shows that if all couple were forward-looking, the sex ratio would fall. This suggests that publicity and education could help alleviate the sex imbalance problem in China. In a similar spirit, I consider the issue of endogenizing transfers from children: in an infinite-horizon dynastic model, the equilibrium level of transfer is around 12% on average, which is lower than the value estimated in the above calibration. Part II. \"Risky Child Investment, Fertility and Social Insurance in China\" This paper investigates the quantitative effect of social insurance on the total fertility rate and on intergenerational transfers from adult children to elderly parents in an environment where investment in children is risky. Social insurance's effect is heterogeneous depending on people's position in the income distribution: a rise in labor income will significantly reduce the fertility rate and increase the old-age transfer, especially for low income people; the magnitude of this effect is also sensitive to the attention children place on parents and their expected long-run economic growth. My results do not support idea that social insurance as a source of s upport in old- age decreases fertility, as argued in Boldrin, et al (2005). Social insurance, acting through i ncome and price effects, actually increases the fertility of low-income people, while slightly decreasing it for those with higher incomes. An increase in the social insurance tax rate increases the fertility rate by only a trivial amount.

This paper uses exogenous variation in a determinant of female bargaining power, women's kin support, to identify the causal effect of women's empowerment on men's extramarital sexual behavior. I est ablish the relevance of kin s upport shocks fo r measures of bargaining power such as women's reported decision-making authority over major and daily household purchases, women's healthcare, and household cooking decisions. Reduced form estimates indicate that having one more adult male sibling alive leads to a decrease of 1.3 percent in the probability of her husband's extramarital behavior. However, the number of living adult female siblings does no t influence her husband's be havior. A measure of shocks to kin support, captured by the death of a woman's young siblings, is shown to increase her husband's extramarital behavior. The ki n support m easures are balan ced across observa bles and results are robus t to excluding households in which women's relatives reside, as well as alternate definitions of the kin support m easures. This sugg ests that a woman's bargaining power within th e household does influence the likelihood of her husband's extramarital sexual behavior, and thus her risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease. Part II. \"Kin Support, Female Bargaining Power, and Child Survival\" It is often argued that child health improves when mothers have more household bargaining power than fathers, but this finding may often be confounded by factors simultaneously affecting household formation. This paper considers the effect of a change in the relative bargaining weights of parents on infant mortality in a given family. Mother's bargaining power, captured by a relative measure of living maternal versus paternal adult brothers, is shown to positively impact women's reported decision-making over household expenditures. However, utilizing only variation across children born to the same mother, I find that the size of the kinship network of the mother at the time of birth has a similar impact on infant mortality as that of the father's network. Interestingly, I find that the presence of both an additional maternal or paternal uncle decreases infant mortality by 0.6 percent, but maternal or paternal aunts do not appear to have a significant effect. This suggests that both mother and father's kin contribute to reducing infant mortality and this effect functions principally through male kin.

Hung Congr essional Juann.Hung@cbo.gov (202) 226-2759 THESIS ABSTRACT Part I: \"Why Do Some Countries Default More Often than Others? The Role of Institutions\" [Job mar ket paper] This paper documents cross-country differences in sovereign default crises and institutional quality using a data set covering more than 80 countries. Two key facts emerge from the analysis: (1) high institutional quality is associated with low occurrence of sovereign default crisis , and (2) in particular, polarized governments are associated with higher sovereign default probabilities. To explain these facts, we develop a model that lin ks government polarization to sovereign default crises. A polarized government defaults more often on its external debt because government parties fail to coordinate and suboptimal debt polic y results. Simulations of the model succeed in explaining qualitatively and quantitatively cross- country differences in sovereign default frequencies, given differences in th e degree of government polarization. Part II: On Graduation from Default, Inflation and Banking Crises: Elusive or Illusion?\" (with Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff) This paper uses a data set covering ove r two hundred years of sovereign debt, ban king and inflation crises to explore the question of how long it ta ke a country to \"graduate\" from the typical pattern of serial crises that most emerging mar kets experience. We find that for default and inflation crises, twenty years is a significan t period, but the distribu tion of recidivism has extremely fat tails. In the case of ban king crises, it is unclear whether countries ever graduate. We also examine the more recent phenomenon of IMF programs, which sometimes result in \"near misses\" but sometimes end in default even af ter a program is instituted. The paper raises the important theoretical question of why countries experience serial default, and how they might graduate.

Theoretically, we show that if the franchisor's reputation is highly important the franchisor asks for higher investment requirements when penalizing a misbehaving franchise is more difficult (weaker law enforcement) and when directly monitoring franchisees is more costly. We empirically test the theoretical predictions using two datasets at the franchisor level. We measure weak law enforcement using the passing of state level good-cause termination/nonrenewal laws for franchise contracts and we measure monitoring costs using the number of states in which a franchisor operates. Us ing a database that contains information for 279 franchisors, before and after the laws were passed in some states, we find that the passing of the laws implied an incremental 2% increase in investment requirements for franchisors located in states where the laws were passed. Using a large database (10,047 franchisor-year observations), posterior to the passing of the laws, we find that franchisors located in states where good-cause termination/nonrenewal laws were passed ask for investment requirements 4.8% higher than franchisors located in states without such laws, and that when a franchisor expands its operations to an additional state it increases investment requirements by 0.64%. Part II. \" How Do Firm Financial Conditions A ffect Product Qual ity and Pricing? \" (with G. Phillips) We analyze the interaction of firm product quality and pricing decisions with financial distress and bankruptcy in the airline industry. We cons ider an airline's ch oices of quality and price as dynamic decisions that trade off current cash flows for future revenue. We examine how mishandled baggage, on-time performance and pricing are related to financial distress and bankruptcy, controlling for the endogeneity of financial distress and bankruptcy. We find that an airline's quality and pricing decisions are differentially affected by financial distress and bankruptcy. Product quality decreases when airlines are in financial distress, consistent with financial distress reducing a firm's incentive to invest in quality. In addition, firms price more aggressively when in financial distress consistent with them trying to increase short-term market share and revenues. In contrast, in bankruptcy product quality increases relative to financial distress. PERSONAL INFORMATION Nationality: Chilean/Greek (J-1 VISA).

This paper undertakes a quantitative investigation of the distributional and welfare consequences of a reduction in inflation in a Bewley-style monetary model of a small open economy. Consumers face idiosyncratic earnings risk and hold (i) non-interest bearing real balances that economize transactions costs of consumption and (ii) internationally-traded risk-free bonds that are useful for consumption smoothing. Motivated by the fact that emerging economies display a high degree of financial dollarization, bonds are modeled as fully dollarized so that their return does not respond to domestic inflation. Anal ytical results for deterministic economies show that redistribution driven by alternative fiscal responses to monetary policy might create asymmetric wealth effects, apart from the classi cal wealth-eroding and consumption-distorting effects of inflation. To that end, the stochastic model is calibrated using Turkish data and used to compare stationary equilibria at different rates of inflation under alternative fiscal arrangements: (i) If fiscal policy responds to changes in seigniorage revenues by adjusting uniform lump-sum transfers, reducing the (quarterly) inflation rate from 10% to 0% lowers aggregate welfare by 2.7% in terms of compensating consumption variation. This is because the inflation tax incidence of the poor is less than transfers, and, when inflation is high, lump-sum transfers create positive wealth effects in favor of the poor. (ii) If fiscal policy responds to changes in seigniorage revenues by adjusting wasteful spending, reducing the inflation rate from 10% to 0% increases aggregate welfare by 2.5% in terms of compensating consumption variation. This is because the asymmetric wealth effects are muted when transfers are constant. (iii) Finally, if fiscal policy responds to changes in seigniorage revenues by adjusting transfers that are in proportion to individual-specific inflation tax payments, reducing the inflation rate from 10% to 0% increases aggregate welfare by 1.5% in terms of compensati ng consumption variation. Even if all costs of inflation are rebated in an individual-specific way, disinflation lowers aggregate welfare, since the substitution effect reduces the bonds demand and the interest income. These results hold, even the model generated financial portfolio of the poor is biased towards non-interest bearing assets. Part II. \"Transitional Dynamics of Disinflation in a Small Open Economy with Heterogeneous Agents\" This paper examines the quantitative properties of the transitional dynamics produced by permanent changes in the inflation rate in an in complete-markets, heterogeneous-agents model of a small open economy. I assume that fiscal policy responds to monetary policy by adjusting uniform lump-sum transfers, creating asymmetric wealth effects in favor of the poor when inflation is high. Steady state comparisons show that a reduction in the (quarterly) inflation rate from 10% to 2% lowers aggregate welfare by 1.97% in terms of compensating consumption variation. However, when the transition is properly accounted for, aggregate welfare is reduced by only 0.05%. This is because transfers are assumed to plummet immediately in the former exercise, whereas the gradual increase in aggregate money demand along the transition causes transfers to temporarily rise before settling down to a lower level. This offsets the disadvantage of the poor. /g51/g40/g53/g54/g50/g49/g36/g47/g3/g44/g49/g41/g50/g53/g48/g36/g55/g44/g50/g49/g3 Nationality: Turkish (F-1 VISA), Gender: Male Language Skills 254-4470 Email: walker@econ.umd.edu Website: http://econweb.umd.edu/~walker /g40/g39/g56/g38/g36/g55/g44/g50/g49/g3 Ph.D. Economics, University of Maryland at College Park, expected May 2011 M.A. Economics, American University, Washington, DC, May 2004 B.S.

Given that over half of incarcerated men are fathers, this surge in the male prison population has important implications for mothers and children. This r esearch uses data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWB), a national sample of mostly unwed parent and their children, to analyze the effect of the incarceration of fathers on the economic wellbeing of mothers. Women who have children with men who become incarcerated differ observably from other mothers in the FFCWB. I employ propensity score matching methods in order to address the non-random selection of men into incarceration and to obtain causal estimates of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET) of father's incarceration on various measures of the economic wellbeing of mothers. I find robust evidence that the incarceration of fathers increases the probability that mothers receive public assistance by 10-20 percentage points. My results suggest that the incarceration of fathers also increases the probability that mothers experience material hardship, including food, housing, and utility related insecurity. Part II: The Effect of the Incarceration of Fathers on the Physical and Mental Health of Mothers This paper analyses the effect of the incarcerati on of fathers on the physical and mental health of mothers. The direction of the effect is theoretically ambiguous. The absence of the father due to incarceration may impose financial burdens and mental distress on the mother, thereby adversely affecting her health. However, the physical separation of the father from the mother, particularly in cases where drug abuse or domestic violence was present, may relieve stress and improve health conditions. Using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, I employ propensity score matching methods to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET) of father's incarceration on the physical health, mental depression, and anxiety of mothers. /g3 Part III: The Effect of the Incarceration of Fathers on Children's Health and Development This paper analyses the effect of the incarceration of fathers on child health, behavior, and cognitive development. The direction of the effect is ambiguous. A father's incarceration may hamper his ability to maintain frequent contact with his children and also impose financial burdens on the mother, thereby adversely affecting children's development and behavior. However, if the father is a negative influence on the family, his absence may enhance children's wellbeing. The effects will be empirical analyzed using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. /g51/g40/g53/g54/g50/g49/g36/g47/g3/g44/g49/g41/g50/g53/g48/g36/g55/g44/g50/g49/g3 Citizenship: U.S. Gender: Female Race: African American JING ZHANG 4318 Rowalt Drive, Apt. 202, Email: zhang-j@econ.umd.edu Website: www.econ.umd.edu/~zhang-j EDUCATION Ph.D. Economics, University of Maryland, College Park, expected May 2011 M.A. Economics, University of Maryland, College Park, 2007 M.A. Economics, Peking University, Beijing, China, 2005 B.A. Economics and Philosophy, Peking University, Beijing, China, 2002 DISSERTATION The Impact of Water Quality on Health in China Committee: Prof. Judith Hellerstein (Chair), Prof. Maureen Cropper, Prof. Soohyung Lee FIELDS OF SPECIALIZATION Primary: Development Economics, Environmental Economics Secondary: Labor Economics, Health Economics PAPERS AND PUBLICATIONS Publications \"Comparing Public and Private Hospitals in China: Evidence from Guangdong\" (with Mingshan Lu et al.), BMC Health Services Research , forthcoming. \"Soft Budget Constraints in China: Evidence from the Guangdong Hospital Industry\" (with Karen Eggleston et al.), International Journal of Healthcare Finance and Economics , 9(2009), 233-242.

This paper investigates the effect of a major water improvement program in rural China on the health of adults and children. Using panel data covering about 4,500 households from 1989 to 2006, I estimate the impact of introducing village- level access to water from water plants on various measures of health. Ordinary least squares estimation of the impact suggests only a weak positive influence of the program on people's health status, but these results are contaminated by endogenous timing and placement of the water quality interventions across China. To address potential endogeneity, I use topographic characteristics of communities as instruments for program placement, as these characteristics affect the cost of the construction of pipelines from water plants into villages. My instrumental variables results show that the introduction of treated water into villages has had a strong impact on the health status of both adults and children. The estimates imply that the illness incidence of adults decreased by 50 percent and their weight for height increased by 26 gram/cm following the program implementation. There was also an improvement in self-reports of health. Children's weight for height and height both rose, by 8 gram/cm and 2.49 cm respectively, as a result of the program. Using a variety of robustness checks, I show that the results are not driven by measurement error, omitted variable bias, or attrition bias, and that the mechanism by which the program was effective was via improved water quality rather than simply via increased access to water. \"What Prevents the Poor from Obtaining Hepatitis B Vaccinations - Price of Vaccination, Travel Cost or Information? Evidence from a Field Experiment in Rural China\" (Work in progress) Poor access to health services is a severe problem in developing countries. This problem is caused by several factors, such as high prices, poor accessibility, or lack of knowledge. This paper aims to disentangle the impacts of these three factors on the demand for Hepatitis B (HB) vaccination by using a randomized experiment in rural China. In our project, we conduct both a household survey, which covers over 1000 households in 5 villages, and a survey of local medical facilities. The household survey enables estimation of household's willingness to pay, based on the contingent valuation method and the Becker-DeGroot-Marshack mechanism, and also elicits their knowledge about Hepatitis B and its vaccine. In addition to interviews based on questionnaires, we offer travel coupons with a random amount of compensation for hospital visits to households. The purpose of this is twofold: first, the randomization improves the measurement of the influence of travel costs - which can be a major obstacle in rural areas - and thereby helps separate travel costs from other factors affecting vaccination demand. Second, the experiment has direct policy relevance, since reimbursement of travel costs could be a potential candidate for government intervention.

This is in contrast to the literature on consumption risk sharing that is mainly about risks at business cycle frequency. We argue that existing tests neglect the permanent elements of risks that are of interest and that their model specifications are not rich enough to accommodate heterogeneous short-run dynamics. Since our methodology focuses on identifying cointegrating relationships while allowing for arbitrary short-run dynamics, we can obtain a consistent estimate of long-run risk sharing while disregarding any short-run nuisance factors. Our results show that, for the period of 1950-2008, the level of long-run risk sharing in the OECD countries is similar to that in emerging market countries. However, during the financial integration episode of the past two decades, long-run risk sharing in OECD countries increased more than that in emerging market countries. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between various measures of financial integration and cross-country risk sharing, but find only weak evidences of such linkages. Part II. \"Theoretical Illustrations on Cross-country Consumption Risk Sharing\" This paper sets up a model to illustrate an essential difference between a bond economy and an insurance economy. We show that a bond economy can intertemporally smooth consumption in the face of transitory output shocks, but not for permanent output shocks; an insurance economy is essential for risk sharing on permanent shocks. We therefore show that when both transitory and permanent output shocks exist, transitory shocks only create noise if the focus of interest is on identifying risk sharing in the long run. TRADE PAPER ABSTRACT \"Impact of Intra-European Trade Agreements, 1990-2005: Policy Implications\" The paper provides quantitative estimates of the impact of the European trade agreements on trade flows. It applies both static and dynamic panel estimation techniques. The results are useful to policymakers because new intra-European trade agreements are being negotiated. In the absence of a further expansion of the European Union, estimates of alternative policies may help to clarify the policy debate. The paper also illustrates that the performance of individual countries under the trade agreements can be explained in terms of their macroeconomic environment. The conclusions are likely to be relevant to the western Balkan countries and Ukraine. PERSO/g49AL I/g49FORMATIO/g49 Nationality: "}
