The mind is very similar to our physical bodies; symptoms develop to let us know that something is amiss. Environments, stress, and trauma influence these symptoms. As our physical bodies seek to heal themselves, so does our minds. Difficulties can be looked at as opportunities for growth. I seek to come alongside and work together to help the healing and growth through therapy and if need be medication. Medication is not sufficient alone. Just as the physical body seeks to heal itself when hurt, so the mind/soul with encouragement can heal.

[Spirituality](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/spirituality)can mean different things to different individuals, depending on their experiences, beliefs, and life histories. Some individuals focus on strengthening their belief system, while others experience spirituality in secular ways, such as through meditation, yoga, or by spending time in nature.

What are the most common treatments that include spirituality? There are several treatments that incorporate spirituality. [Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy)) helps a person examine and reframe their negative thoughts and behaviors.
