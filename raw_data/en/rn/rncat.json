The term \"missing children\" has been used for many years to describe very different kinds of events, making it difficult to estimate the magnitude of these phenomena or to formulate appropriate public responses. A 1988 national incidence study sought to measure the \"missing child problem\" by examining several distinct problems. Broadly defined: Parental/family abduction 354,100 children per year A family member took a child or failed to return a child at the end of an agreed-upon visit in violation of a custody agreement/decree with the child away at least overnight. Defined as serious: 163,200 children per year A family member took the child out of state or attempted to conceal/prevent contact with the child, or abductor intended to keep child or permanently change custodial privileges. Stranger/nonfamily abduction 3,200 - 4,600 children per year Coerced and unauthorized taking of a child, or detention or luring for pur- poses of committing another crime. NPOISC-Keith-12 200 - 300 children per year A nonfamily abduction where the abductor was a stranger and the child was gone overnight, or taken 50 miles or more, or ransomed, or killed, or the perpetrator showed intent to keep the child permanently. Runaway 450, 700 children per year A child who left home without per- mission and stayed away at least overnight or who was already away and refused to return home. Thrownaway 127,100 children per year A child who was told to leave home, or whose caretaker refused to let come home when away, or whose caretaker made no effort to recover when the child ran away, or who was abandoned. 133,500 children per year A runaway who during a runaway episode was without a secure and familiar place to stay. 59,200 children per year A thrownaway who during some part of the episode was without a secure and familiar place to stay. Otherwise Missing 438,200 children per year 139,100 children per year Children missing for varying periods depending on age, disability, and whether the absence was due to injury. An otherwise missing case where police were called. Source: Adapted from Finkelhor, D., Hotaling, G., and Sedlack, A. (1990). Missing, abducted, runaway and thrownaway children in America.

X :ii!!!!~iii~i!i~: Missing and Abducted Children: A Law Enforcement Guide to Case Investigation and Program Management NPO/SC-Keith-15 Initial Response Investigative Checklist The purpose of this Investigative Checklist is to provide law enforcement officers and agencies with a generic guide for the investigation of missing child cases. Law enforcement administrators should ensure that their agencies have established effective policies and procedures for the handling of missing/abducted child investigations. Compliance with an agency's standard operating procedures, by officers conducting missing child investigations, can result in efficient operations and successful resolution of the incident. This checklist is not intended to be followed step-by-step by officers during each missing child investigation. It is meant to provide them with a framework of actions, considerations, and activities that can assist them in performing competent, productive, and successful missing/abducted children investigations. Please Consult the text of this chapter for details on the items listed. NPOISC-Keith-16 Initial Response Investigative Checklist (con't) Administrative ( ) Intake report from parent/caller.

SlNG CHILDI~.EN I~.EGISTEI~ ACTIVITY I ii i i i iiii i i IIIII i i i ii iiii HIGHLIGHTS During 1995, the Missing Children Register received 27,830 reports of children missing from New York State, a decrease of nine percent over 1994. A smaller number of cases were cancelled (26,419) than were reported during the year, resulting in a 23 percent increase in the number of active cases at the end of 1995 than the previous year. 1 Reporting volume fluctuated by month during the year showing no clear pattern to missing children reports, other than a general decline during the summer months. May had the highest number of cases reported (2,791) while Decembe.r had the fewest number of cases (1,641). Reportsof missing children were concentrated in New York's largest urban areas. Suffolk County reported the highest volume of cases (2,836) followed by Westchester, Monroe, Erie and Onondaga counties (New York City counties do not report separately to the Register.) Hamilton County was the only one to not report any cases of missing children during the year. Overall, 14 counties each had fewer than 50 reported cases. - Controlling for the under age 18 population by county, the Capital District counties of Schenectady and Albany had the highest rates of case reporting in the State (18.9 and 16.4 per 1,000 children, respectively). These counties were found to have unusually large numbers of repeat cases involving children who ran away from group homes or other facilities, and well established procedures for the timely reporting of these children as missing. The statewide rate of reporting was 6.2 missing children cases per 1,000 children in 1995. The overwhelming majority of missing children cases involved suspected runaways (92%). Abduction cases accounted for only one percent of the total reports, and abductions committed by family members comprised the most frequent form of abduction. There were four reports of children abducted by strangers during 1995. (Note: The number of stranger abductions reported to the Register is deceptive. Typically, cases are not categorized as stranger abductions unless someone actually saw the child being abducted. Cases initially categorized as \"circumstances unknown\" have later been found to have involved stranger abductions. These records, however, are not always updated on the Register). Ninety percent of the children reported missing were age 13 or older, 59 percent were female, and 60 percent were white. The single largest group of cases involved white females 13 years and older (25% of total cases reported). About half of the 26,419 cases closed during 1995 were resolved by the child voluntarily returning home. Law enforcement efforts were involved in the return of 29 percent of the cases, and 14 children who had been reported missing were found deceased. ,% I Cases are considered \"active\" until the reporting agency transmits a case cancellation notice to the Register. The New York City Missing Persons Unit has been experiencing large backlogs in sending cancellation notices due to staff shortages. Because of these reporting delays, the increase in active cases is artificially inflated and should not be interpreted as an accurate measure of the number of missing children cases still open.

Figures for previous years only included children who were under the age of sixteen. Statewide totals include cases from non.New York State agencies not induded in the three geographical areas. Suburban New York City consists of Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester counties. The large increase in \"active\" cases is result of the large backlog in sending cancellation notices from the New York City Police Department when children are located. Therefore, this figure does not represent the true number of active cases on the Register involving children who are sti!l missing at the end of the year.

This monthly focuses on fundraising and administration. I have seen the first two and found them both interesting. I haven't seen the last two. The following publications are available at your local library, and are well worth your spending some time becoming familiar with the assistance they offer. 0 0 0 National Directory of Corporate Giving -- This will list corporations with foundations and giving programs by state, similar to The Foundation Directory. This is worthwhile because it includes giving programs, not just corporate foundations. The Foundation Directory published by The Foundation Center. First, this directory is updted annually and lists every Foundation handing out money in the US. Foundations are listed by state, by type of support (i.e. seed money, individual grants, in kind gitts), and by subject. Next, the directory lists libraries that house cooperating collections (by state). These collections include specific guides, two of which I imagine areof interest to you: The National Guide to Funding for Children, Youth and Families and The National Guide for Community Development. I have attached a copy of a foundation listing from my home state. This is out of the general directory. The specific guides give even more detailed information, primarily on previous grants awarded. As you can see, this gives you lots of information! I suggest when you're looking through these guides, you keep an open mind about the category your request might fit in. For example, you might be eligible for funding through community development/neighborhood associations, or crime/violennce 0 0 0 prevention, children & youth or crisis services. If you go through children and youth, areas you could take advantage of include crime/abuse victims, education or safety. Another publication of the Foundation Center is The Literature of the NonProfit Sector, and it is available in the cooperating collection. You can also find other good info at your local library, including lists of manufacturers and large companies by state, by county, with all sorts of specifics like number of employees and officer's names. All of that info can come in handy! One last publication I'll mention is NSFRE News, published by NSFRE. It comes out eight times yearly and is $25/year for non-members.

Retirees also have tons of experience you would be wise to try to tap into. Civic Clubs -- these clubs always need speakers and are interested in what is happening in their community, so tell them what you're doing and how you're making a difference. It's a good opportunity to recruit volunteers, get them to do a fund-raiser for you, dr make a straight donation. Find out where their interests lie, because they may be especially interested in assisting children. For example, the Lion's primary philanthropy is aid to the blind, however, Altrusa began as a women's civic organization, and they otten focus their efforts to benefit women and children. Clubs you'll probably find in your community include: Rotary, Jayeees, Civitan, Lions, BPE (Elks), Altrusa and Sertoma. Look in your local paper for meeting dates and contact names. Banks -- are required to give through the Community Reinvestment Act both money, and people to community service. Get the new loan officer on your side! 0 0 0 Greek Organizations -- even if you don't have campus nearby with a Greek system, there are probably alumnae groups in your area that may be looking for a worthy cause to support. Speaking of college campuses, students today are looking for philanthropic fulfillment, so they can be a source for you. Be sure what you ask them to do suits their schedules and interests. 0 0 0 IRS RECEIPTING INFORMATION The IRS has made changes in how individuals report charitable donations. requirements place some new responsibilities on 501(c)3 organizations. These #1 Acanceled check is not sufficient for donations over $250 annually. Ifa donor writes a $250 check or 5 $50 checks in a year to one organization, the IRS requires a receipt. It is the charity's responsibility to provide that receipt. #2 Ifa charity holds a fund-raiser where the donor receives something in return, any receipt given must show the fair market value. If the donation is $75 or more, a receipt is required. For example, if you host a golf tournament, and the fee is $75 a player, you must note the fair market value of that round of golf (including cart rental, if used) and issue a receipt. If the fee is $50 a player and one person pays for the team, that person must be receipted. Again, it is the charity's responsibility to provide that receipt. #3 If you ask for a donation in kind, or for an item or service, DO NOT receipt the donor for the dollar value of the donation. A thank you letter noting what the item or service was is sufficient for the IRS. That way, the donor can argue with an auditor over the value of that floral arrangement or computer, not you. ID ID ID MARKETING AND ADVERTISING SOURCES As you're seeing with this session, marketing is EVERYTHING!!! But, marketing expertise can be expensive. Here are some sources and ways to market yourself without spending a fortune. College or University close by? Call the head of the Advertising/Public Relations or Marketing Department and volunteer your organization as a guinea pig. Students have to do marketing and ad projects, singly and in groups. Let them get the experience while you benefit. Along those lines, many students are willing to serve as an intern for no pay or a small stipend. The school may have an internship program set up already, with guidelines, but if it doesn't, don't let that stop you from asking! Remember, if students are working for class credit, they may need a defined job description, so be willing to provide that to them. Radio and TV stations can be your friends, The stations will put your public service announcements on the air, but do your homework. Check with the community affairs director or station manager to see if they want to read your PSA, want it pre-recorded (for radio) or are willing (or not) to shoot a 30 second PSA for TV. Give them a specific time frame to run PSA's. Don't expect them to run in prime time indefinitely. Also, don't even think about trying to talk to a community affairs person at a TV station at 0 0 0 sweeps time. These sweeps weeks occur in February, May and November, so take them into account in your planning. Volunteers who handle marketing every day! If you know someone in the marketing business, they may be willing to volunteer to assist you in getting publicity. If they can't volunteer to do that, ask them to look over what you've prepared the first time or two, and make suggestions. If they don't have time to do that, ask them to provide a current list of media outlets in your community, so you'll at least know who to contact! Take what you can get from a volunteer and be grateful for whatever they offer. Getting the word out the way you want it in newspapers. When you send a press release, use the format papers like, and your chances of seeing your group's name in print increases significantly. It may be worth it to purchase an AP Stylebook, or at least look through one at the library. In the meantime, these are important components. Don't put \"For Immediate Release\" ... Do put a \"For Release By\" date. Get the release in at least two weeks before the release date. Give them a headline that's brief and a contact name and phone number. Put \"END\" at the end think it's wise to keep them to two pages. them. Reporters like them. or use \"# # #\".

Prcparexl by Helen Fitzgerald, CDE 0 0 0 SOME GUIDELINES FOR PARENTS TO HELP A CHILD DURING A TIME OF COMMUNITY WORRY AND CONCERN . As soon as possible after the triggering event set aside time to talk to your child. It is very important that you do this as your child will be hearing about it in any case, and it is best that this disturbing news come from you. 2. Give your child the facts in a simple manner. Don't go into too much detail. Your child will ask more questions as they come to mind. 3. If you can't answer certain questions, it's OK to say, \"1 don't know how to answer that, but perhaps we can find someone who will answer that question for us.\" 4. Use the correct language. \"suspect.\" Say the words that apply -- \"missing,\" \"kidnapped,\" 5. Ask questions. \"What are you feeling? .... What have you heard from your friends?\" \"What do you think has happened?\" . Explain your feelings to your child, especially if you are crying. Give your child permission to cry, too. Parents are role models, and it's OK for children to see our sadness and to share in our feelings. . It is OK to let your child know you are fearful, but then let your child know what you are doing to make things safe. Get ideas from your child on how you do this more effectively. Your child's ideas can be valuable and also can help your child overcome the feeling of being powerless. (Note: If your own feelings are overwhelming, if you are feeling panic yourself, find someone who can help you, but try to avoid imparting this panic to your child.) 8. Keep in mind the age and level of comprehension of your child, and speak to that level. 9. Talk about feelings: about being fearful, unsafe, sad, angry, depressed, scared, tearful. 10.If you find your child whiny, clinging to you or experiencing sleep disturbances, he or she may fear one of you will also disappear or be harmed. Feeling insecure and frightened, your child will need a lot of reassurance from you, a lot of touching and contact with you. Over time this will help your child relax and become less fearful. 1 1.Whenever a child disappears, there is a/ways the worry that the child has been murdered. On the reverse side are additional guidelines for parents when the issue of death must be dealt with. 1 2.As soon as possible after the discovery set time aside to talk to your child. Once again it is best that this information come from you and that it be factual, simple and honest, using the correct language. 1 0 0 0 13.Ask if your child is hearing new words that need explaining. 14.Again, ask questions. \"What are you feeling? .... What have you heard from your friends? .... What do you think happened?\" 15.Don't hesitate to refer to the deceased by his or her name. The person may be dead, but he or she is a person to be remembered and loved, not spoken of only in hushed pronouns. 16.Read a book on a child's response to death. For example, The Grieving Child by Helen Fitzgerald. New York. Fireside, 1992. 17.Talk about the funeral or memorial service. Explain what happens there, and find out whether your child wants to attend. 18.Think about ways your child can say \"goodbye\" to the deceased. This might be by attending the funeral or presenting flowers to the family or by writing a note to the deceased that could be buried with the body. 19. Depending on your religious views, you may want to talk to your child about your belief in life after death. But be careful not to say things like, \"It was God's will\" etc. Statements like this raise more questions than they answer. 20. Invite your child to come back to you if he or she has more questions or has heard disturbing rumors. Assure him or her that you will answer any question to which you know the answer or endeavor to get the correct information when you don't. 21 .Talk about memories - good ones and ones not so good. 22.Watch out for \"bad dreams.\" Are they occurring often? Talking about them is a way to discharge stress. 23. Watch for behavioral changes in your child. They are often symptoms of internal stress. 24. Friends, family, and school mates often find solace and comfort in doing something in the name of the person who died; for example, providing for a memorial of some kind. 25.Sudden death, violent death, or death of a young person is especially hard to grieve, and disruption of sleep, appetite and daily activities are normal responses. 26. If you find your child is developing problems that you don't know how to handle, don't hesitate to seek professional help. Prepared by Helen Fitzgerald, CDE 2 0 0 0 Continuing Reminders Of Your Loss: Coping With The Holidays by Helen Fitzgerald Scott Brouwer ~er what religion you are, Christmas is the biggest holiday of the year and certainly the one that is most advertised, as this is when stores make their biggest sales for the year. This holiday is so commercialized that it is impossible to ignore it. There are reminders of Christmas everywhere you turn; advertisements in the newspapers and magazines, on the radio and television, on the greeting card shelf, in the store and restaurant decorations and displays, and in the way your friends and casual acquaintances greet you. It is the holiday that requires the most preparation for most people. Here are some things for you to consider that may help make this holiday more bearable. Decide on how much of the holiday you can or want to handle and modify your traditions. Writin,.: out greeting cards, for example, may be too much. In that case, pass them up this year or at least trim your list down. If decorations are more than you can handle, put up what you can or ask for help from family members. If shopping is too difficult, try giving cash or ordering your gifts from a magazine. Once you have thought the holiday through, have a conference with family members and or friends to let them know your plans and to hear theirs. Be prepared to compromise a bit to reach a plan that everyone can accept. You may decide to honor your I:-~ II 1QG~ TH A NAT(\"~I1 ~ 0 0 0 llow yourself time to think about and acknowledge your grief and realize your holiday may have both happy and sad moments. loved one by having a photo of him/her in a special place decorated with evergreens and brightly colored balls. Or perhaps a miniature tree could be purchased and tiny decorations added every year in his/her memory. Let your family know your idea and get their input. Know that there still may be friends who have not heard of your loved one's death and you may receive a Christmas card addressed to both of you or asking about him/her. Allow yourself time to think about and acknowledge your grief and realize your holiday may have both happy and sad moments. If others in your family are willing, take time out to talk about your loved one who has died. Set limits for yourself. Grief is exhausting work and you need to have quiet time to rest and to reflect. Be careful with excessive use of alcohol and overeating - they can make you depressed. Some people elect to do something very different on the first Christmas without their loved one - something so different that the absence of the loved one won't be so obvious, maybe even going to a totally different place. People then often return to old traditions the following year perhaps developing some new traditions to add to the old. You may decide to work on Christmas if you have this option, giving a coworker a chance to spend the holiday with his or her family. You may decide to do some volunteer work on this day such as working in a hospital or with the homeless. Think of a response you can use to the greeting, \"Merry Christmas\" or \"Happy New Year\". The religious services of Christmas can be reassuring, or they can be upsetting. Think how they would affect you and then decide what would be best for you as far as attending or not attending them. Plan something you can look forward to after the holiday in January or February to lessen the post-holiday letdown and a reward for getting through them. Look for a lecture or workshop on how to cope with the holidays. Remember the anticipation of a holiday is often harder than the actual day. If you find the stress, anxiety and loneliness too overwhelming, it is always O.K. to reach out for help. Contact your clergy, a good friend or a professional.

Hilgeman, M.A. Executive Director, Vanished Children's Alliance Your child was missing and is about to be or has been reunified with you. Below are some suggestions intended to assist you with the adjustment of your child and family. Keep in mind that this is meant as a guide. No two children or families react in the same way. What to do when initially reunited with your ilbducted child I. Prior to the reunion, have an experienced mental health professional assist in meeting the child and explaining to him/her what has happened and what will happen next. The therapist should help to prepare the child for the reunion. 2. Reunification should not occur in the presence of the abductor. . You should remain as calm as possible and speak in a soothing voice. Loud, emotional outbursts could additionally frighten the child. . Physical contact with the child should proceed slowly and carefully. (Hugs, kisses, pats on the back might scare him/her.) . Situate yourself to be at eye level with your child. This puts your child on an equal level with you and is a form of empowerment. . Do not disparage the abductor in front of the child. Separate the deed from the doer. Focus on how the child is and how the child is feeling. . Let the child know what will occur, i.e. you'll be going home together, law enforcement will need to speak to the child/family. . If the child asks what is going to happen to the abductor, explain that the abductor is probably going to have to go to court and tell the judge why (s)he took the ID ID ID child. Right now that person is safe. You can then redirect the conversation by saying that you are happy to see the child and you'll keep the child informed as you are informed. . If possible, limit the number of people at the reunification. Avoid extended family, friends, and media at the initial reunion. 10. Reassure the child that you understand he/she might be feeling frightened but that everything will be okay and that you love and will protect him/her. 11. Bring past photographs of the child and you together, and perhaps a past favorite toy that the child might remember, making them available to the child. 12. Whenever possible, give the child some choices for acquiring an improved sense of control (i.e. Would you like a soft drink? What kind? Would you like it in the can or in a glass?) 13. Allow the child to be and feel what he/she is feeling within safety limits. The child may appear frozen (usually indicates frozen fright or numbing), or demonstrate one or more of the following behaviors: crying, screaming, laughing, giggling, fighting, hitting, pulling, biting, urinating, compliance. 14. The child should get an immediate physical exam. When you arrive home . Explain and show the child around the house, where he/she will sleep, where important articles are. . Insulate the child from numerous people. Try to spend some individual/special time with the child that will improve his/her adjustment. . Be careful what you say to the child or in the presence of the child ( i.e. on the phone or to someone else) about the surrounding events or the abductor. . When well-wishers are allowed, set boundaries, times, and established allowable statements to make in the presence of the child. . Remember to positively interact with your other children and your partner. Unspoken jealousies can begin here. 0 0 0 . Ensure your child's safety. The child may fear reabduction. (i.e. in the front yard, to and from school, when seeing the abductor in court) . Respect the child's need for physical or emotional space or child's need for safety and security by following you or clinging to you. Oneoine - After initial homecomine . The child may initially be compliant and later need to express some independence by acting out and testing limits. 2. Establish clear, loving boundaries. 3. Encourage your child and give positive reinforcement for good behavior. . Consequences for misbehaving should be discussed with the child in advance and should never include physical punishment. These might include time out, removal of toys or privileges for a reasonable period of time. Consequences should always be employed in a calm manner and followed through completely. The child should never feel your love is conditional or that his/her behavior could impact that. . Involve your child and family in Individual or family therapy. Interview therapists and select one who has a positive track record working with missing or abducted children, abused children, or victims of crime. Check with your local Victim Witness program or the Vanished Children's Alliance for referrals. Check to see if you, your child, and family might qualify for state victim compensation to cover some of the therapy costs. . When your child attends school, inform the school of safety concerns. Provide the school with a copy of your custody order if applicable. Determine school's release policy, adult office check-in policy, and insure that the school has a school call back program. . Ask neighbors to advise you if any people or cars seem to be monitoring your residence, your child's school, or play areas. . Hake sure you have necessary and current custody orders and that you have several file-endorsed copies readily available. . Have your child photographed and fingerprinted and a current, completed VCA I.D. sheet always on hand. 0 0 0 I0. Your child, at some point, is likely to have contact with an abducting parent. If it looks like this may occur, try to have the abducting parent receive only supervised visitation and/or be required to post a sizeable bond. 11. Make sure your child knows his/her correct name, address, phone number, your full name and who he/she can go to for help when away from you. 12. There are many ways to communicate the anger that you are probably feeling about what has happened (i.e. verbally, voice tone and/or body language). Be aware, however, that children are often very self-centered. They are the center of their universe and thus feel responsible for all that happens around them. Your child may feel responsible for what has happened to him/her as well as feeling that he/she has caused your anger or pain. 13. Many parents live day to day dreaming of their recovery of their children. The fantasy often includes the scenario of living happily ever after once reunited. The reality, however, is that just as you have been changed by the experience, so have they.., perhaps even more. Although the clock cannot be turned back, a \"new normal\" can be established. 14. It is difficult to assess the long-term ramifications of child abduction on children. We see the entire spectrum, from positive reconstruction of their lives to post traumatic stress disorder. We encourage you to get necessary early family intervention to reduce the likelihood of long-term negative consequences. 15. Allow your child to speak about his/her experience and to share both positive and negative experiences he/she had while missing. If your Child expresses a positive feeling or experience about or with the abductor, it is not a reflection on you. In the long run, by allowing open and honest communication you will be the catalyst to your child's healing. 16. Develop a support system for yourself. Your parenting job is a big one and you are not superhuman. Take care of yourself. This is not selfish. On the contrary, by modeling self care and self respect your child(ren) may also develop these characteristics. If you model being a martyr, your child is also likely to view himself/herself as a victim; a role that can perpetuate itself into adulthood. You cannot change the past but you can change how you look at it and thus create a brighter future.

Hilgeman, Vanished Children's Alliance - All Rights Reserved 0 0 0 TIPS FOR PROFESSIONALS WORKING WITH MISSING AND ABDUCTED CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES Respond to their emotional and physical needs. Help them to feel safe and secure. Provide opportunities for them to regain control by giving them choices and decision making power. Allow them to talk about the experience. Listen carefully and intently. Validate their experience. Give acknowledgment and acceptance that their reactions are normal. Assist with details of daily life. Tell them the truth. Help them to predict and prepare for what is upcoming. Provide them with information on where, when, and how. This allows them some sense of control over what is happening to them. Stay in the present. Use 'T' messages vs. \"You\" messages. Make appropriate referrals. Make follow up contacts and check-ins.

Effective Practices for NPO's and State Clearinghouses ID ID Q HOW TO PREPARE A VICTIM FOR THE MEDIA * MAKE SURE (S)HE KNOWS HIS OR HER RIGHTS AS A CRIME VICTIM. * PROVIDE THE VICTIM WITH AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THE MEDIA WORKS. * WHEN A REPORTER IS COMING TO INTERVIEW A VICTIM, SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THAT REPORTER WITH HIM OR HER, PARTICULARLY ALL OF THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF THE REPORTER'S CAREER OF WHICH YOU ARE AWARE. CITE EXAMPLES OF GOOD STORIES THAT THE REPORTER HAS WRITTEN OR COVERED. * EXPLAIN TO THE VICTIM THE SETTING AND PLAYERS INVOLVED IN AN INTERVIEW, IE., REPORTER, CAMERAPERSON, SOUND TECHNICIAN, EQUIPMENT, ETC. * EXPLAIN THAT THE FINAL STORY WILL BE EDITED, AND ADVISE THE VICTIM TO KEEP HIS OR HER ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT (ESPECIALLY FOR ELECTRONIC MEDIA). * PLAN IN ADVANCE WHOM THE VICTIM WISHES TO HAVE PRESENT AT THE INTERVIEW, IE., FAMILY MEMBERS, MINISTER, FRIEND, ETC. * ASK THE VICTIM IN ADVANCE WHERE (S)HE IS MOST COMFORTABLE SITTING. MAKE THAT AREA OF THE ROOM AS PLEASING AS POSSIBLE FOR ANY CAMERAS. * ASK THE VICTIM IF (S)HE WISHES TO HAVE A SPECIFIC TIME LIMITATION ON THE INTERVIEW. IF A TIME LIMIT IS PROPOSED, INFORM THE REPORTER IN ADVANCE OF THE VICTIM'S WISHES. * IF THE VICTIM WISHES TO HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH OR VISUAL AID, BE SURE IT IS READILY AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF THE INTERVIEW. * HELP THE VICTIM LOOK HIS OR HER BEST. * HELP THE VICTIM PREPARE A THIRTY-SECOND STATEMENT, WHEN APPLICABLE. * IF THE VICTIM HAS CERTAIN ISSUES (S)HE WISHES TO DISCUSS, PREPARE A WRITTEN OVERVIEW OF THESE TOPICS. PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO THE REPORTER IN ADVANCE OF IllS/HER ARRIVAL. National Victim Center 0 0 0 VICTIMS' RIGHTS IN THE MEDIA * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY \"NO\" TO AN INTERVIEW Never feel that because you have unwillingly been involved in an incident of public interest that you must personally share the details and/or your feelings with the general public. If you decide that you want the public to be aware of how traumatic and unfair your victimization was, you do not have to automatically give up your right to privacy. By knowing and requesting respect for your rights, you can be heard and yet not violated. * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SELECT THE SPOKESPERSON OR ADVOCATE OF YOUR CHOICE Selecting one spokesperson - especially in multi-victim cases- eliminates confusion and contradictory statements. You also have the right to expect the media to respect your selection of a spokesperson or advocate. * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SELECT THE TIME AND LOCATION FOR MEDIA INTERVIEWS Remember, the media is governed by deadlines. However, nobody should be subjected to a reporter arriving unannounced at the home of a victim. When you are traumatized, your home becomes your refuge. If you wish to protect the privacy of your home, select another location such as a church, meeting hall, office setting, etc. It helps if you are familiar and comfortable with the surroundings. * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUEST A SPECIFIC REPORTER As a consumer of daily news, each of us identifies with or respects a reporter whom we may never have met. We often form personal opinions about reporters whom we feel are thorough, sensitive, compassionate and objective. If a newspaper, radio station, or television station contactsyou for an interview, don't hesitate to request the reporter you feel will provide accurate and fair coverage of your story. 0 0 0 * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT A TELEVISION INTERVIEW USING A SILHOUETTE OR A NEWSPAPER INTERVIEW WITHOUT HAVING YOUR PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN There are many ways for media professionals to protect your physical image without using your photograph or film footage of you, therefore protecting your identity. * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO COMPLETELY GIVE YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY RELATED TO YOUR VICTIMIZATION If you feel that a reporter is not asking questions which need to be addressed, you have the right to give a personal statement. And if the alleged or convicted offender grants interviews which are inaccurate, you have the right to publicly express your point of view. * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFRAIN FROM ANSWERING REPORTERS' QUESTIONS DURING TRIAL If there is any chance of jeopardizing your case by interacting with the media during judicial proceedings, you have the right to remain silent. * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO FILE A FORMAL COMPLAINT AGAINST A REPORTER A reporter's superior would appreciate knowing when his or her employee's behavior is unethical, inappropriate or abusive. By reporting such behavior, you will also protect the next unsuspecting victim who might fall prey to such offensive reporters or tactics. * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO GRIEVE IN PRIVACY Grief is a highly personal experience. If you do not v/ish to share it publicly, you have the right to ask reporters to remove themselves during times of grief. 0 0 * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW IN ADVANCE WHAT DIRECTION THE STORY ABOUT YOUR VICTIMIZATION IS GOING TO TAKE You have the right to know what questions reporters will ask you, along with the right to veto any question. This places you in a partnership with the reporter who is covering the story. * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REVIEW THE STORYLINE PRIOR TO PUBLICATION Articles are reviewed and i:evised by editors who have neither seen nor spoken to you. All too often, victims' statements and the intended impact of their statements are misinterpreted or inaccurate. To protect your interests and the message you wish to convey, you have the right to request final review of the storyline. * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AVOID A PRESS CONFERENCE ATMOSPHERE AND SPEAK TO ONLY ONE REPORTER AT A TIME At a time when you are in a state of shock, a press conference atmosphere with numerous reporters can be confusing and emotionally draining. If a press conference is absolutely unavoidable, you have the right to select one reporter to asks questions for the majority present. * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEMAND A CORRECTION WHEN INACCURATE INFORMATION IS REPORTED All news mediums have methods of correcting inaccurate reporting or errors in stories. Use these means to correct any aspect of media coverage which you feel is inaccurate. * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK THAT OFFENSIVE PHOTOGRAPHS OR. VISUALS BE OMITTED FROM AIRING OR PUBLICATION If you feel that graphic photographs or visuals are not the best representation of you or your loved ones, you have the right to ask that they not be used. 0 0 0 * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE AN INTERVIEW WITH A SPECIFIC REPORTER EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE GRANTED INTERVIEWS TO OTHER REPORTERS You may feel that certain reporters are callous, insensitive, uncaring or judgmental. It is your right to avoid these journalists at all costs. By refusing to speak to such reporters, you may help them recognize their shortcomings in reporting victim- related stories. However, recognize that the reporter may write the story regardless of your participation. * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY \"NO\" TO INTERVIEWS EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY GRANTED INTERVIEWS It's important to recognize that victims often ride an emotional \"roller coaster\". You may be able one day to talk with a reporter, and be physically or emotionally unable to do so the next. Victims should never feel \"obliged\" to grant interviews under any circumstances. * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO RELEASE A WRrrTEN STATEMENT THROUGH A SPOKESPERSON IN LIEU OF AN INTERVIEW There may be times when you are emotionally incapable of speaking with the media, but you still wish to express your point of view. Writing and distributing your statement through a spokesperson allows you to express your views without personally granting interviews. * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXCLUDE CHILDREN FROM INTERVIEWS Children already suffering from the trauma of crime are often retraumatized by exposure to the media. Children often lack the means to verbalize their emotions and may be misinterpreted by both the media and the public. You have a responsibility to protect the interest of children at all costs! * YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFRAIN FROM ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS WITH WHICH YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE OR THAT YOU FEEL ARE INAPPROPRIATE You should never feel you have to answer a question just because it's asked. 0 0 0 Resources for Families,.

Access $256D96 0 0 0 O U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs 02ffce for Victims of Crime The mission of the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) is to enhance the Nation's capacity to assist crime victims and provide leadership in changing attitudes and practices to promote justice and healing for all victims of crime. OVC administers the Crime Victims Fund (Fund) which was authorized by the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA), as amended. The Fund consists of criminal fmes, forfeited bail bonds, penalty fees, and special assessments collected by U.S. Attorneys, the U.S. Courts, + and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. OVC makes awards annually to state crime victim assistance and compensation programs to supplement state funding for victim services. In addition, OVC provides victim assistance training and technical assistance for criminal justice personnel and direct service providers. Exploited children, families of missing and exploited children, and professionals investigating, prosecuting, and providing direct services are eligible to participate in OVC sponsored programs. What services are available? Crime Victim Compensation: Crime victim compensation is the direct payment to, or on the behalf of, a crime victim for crime-related expenses such as medical bills, mental health counseling, funeral costs, and lost wages. Every state administers a crime victim compensation program. Most programs have similar eligibility requirements and offer a comparable range of benefits. The typical program requires victims to report crimes to police in a timely manner and to file claims within a fixed period of time. Each year, OVC uses VOCA funds to supplement state resources; states receive a grant based on 40 percent of the amount of compensation benefits made by the state in a previous year. Crime Victim Assistance: Crime victim assistance programs are direct service programs that provide services such as crisis intervention, counseling, emergency transportation to court, temporary housing, and criminal justice support and advocacy. All states receive VOCA victim assistance grant funding, and states, in turn, award subgrants to community based public and non-profit organizations such as domestic violence shelters, child abuse programs, victim services in law enforcement agencies and prosecutor's offices, hospitals, and social service agencies that serve crime victims. Each state receives a base amount of $200,000 plus a perentage of the remaining amount based upon population. Training and Technical Assistance: OVC's Trainers Bureau improves services to crime victims by providing training and technical assistance to victim assistance programs and agencies that serve crime victims. The Trainers Bureau is designed to assist federal, state, and local agencies in addressing training, administrative, and programmatic issues. Immediate Response to Emerging Problems (IREP): OVC's IREP Program is designed to improve services to communities that have experienced crimes resulting in multiple victimizations. The program provides rapid response, limited technical assistance based upon the needs of victim service agencies, federal, state, and local criminal justice agencies, U.S. Attorney's offices, Native American tribes, or other agencies that assist crime victims. Information Dissemination: OVC's Resource Center provides victim-related information to practitioners, policymakers, researchers, and crime victims. The OVC Resource Center collects, maintains, and disseminates information about national, state, and local victim-related organizations, and about state programs that receive funds authorized by VOCA. The OVC Resource Center is a component of the National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS), the world's largest criminal justice information clearinghouse. 1-800-627-6872 Who are the primary recipients/target groups of these services? 0 0 0 0 Child victims of exploitation Parents and families of missing and exploited children Federal, state, and local criminal justice personnel and other professionals handling cases of maising and exploited children The general public, interested in child-victim information Ho.....~w can these services be accessed?

Each year, millions of dollars are deposited into this Fund from criminal fines, forfeited bail bonds, penalty fees, and special assess- ments collected by the U.S. Attorneys Offices, the U.S. Courts, and the Bureau of Prisons. These dollars come from offenders convicted of Federal crimes--not from taxpayers. U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is responsible for ;ecuting criminals and for collecting the payment of fines. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts is re- sponsible for providing financial information on the Fund deposits, which are held by the U.S. Treasury. Most of the money is administered by the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) and distributed to States to fund victim assistance and compensation programs. How many dollars have been deposited into the Fund? When VOCA was enacted in 1984, the Fund ceiling was set at $100 million. Amendments to VOCA in 1986, 1988, and 1990 raised the ceiling to $110, $125, and $150 mil- lion, respectively. In 1992, VOCA was. amended again, and the ceiling was removed. Although deposits fluctuate from year to year, from 1985 through 1994, over $1.2 billion has been deposited into the Fund. How are Fund deposits disbursed? The first $6.2 million deposited in the Fund during Fiscal Years 1992 through 1995, and $3 million thereafter, is available to the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts to a centralized, automated National Fine Center. Center was established to receive all fines and assessments, compute interest and penalties,- send monthly statements to debtors, prepare and mail delin- quency and default notices for DOJ, and provide statisti- cal information on the deposits received in the Fund. The next $10 million is used to improve the investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases. The $10 million is split between the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ($8.5 million) and OVC ($1.5 million.) The por- tion administered by OVC is used exclusively to help Na- tive Americans improve the investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases, particularly child sexual abuse. The remaining Fund deposits are distributed in the follow- ing ways: 48.5 percent to State compensation programs; 48.5 percent to State assistance programs; and 3 percent for training and other assistance to expand and improve the delivery of services to crime victims, including victims of Federal crimes. VICTIM COMPENSATION What is crime victim compensation? Crime victim compensation is a direct payment to, or on behalf of, a crime victim for crime-related expenses such as unpaid medical bills, mental health counseling, funeral costs, and lost wages. Other compensable costs may in- clude such expenses as eyeglasses or other corrective lenses, dental services and devices, prosthetic devices, and crime scene cleanup. What is a crime victim compensation program? Every State administers a crime victim compensation pro- gram through a central agency that may or may not have branch offices. These programs provide assistance to victims of both Federal and State crimes. I I I II Although each State compensation program is adminis- tered independently, most programs have similar eligibility requirements and offer a comparable range of benefits. Maximum awards generally rang e between $10,000 and $25,000. The typical State compensation program requires victims to report crimes to police within 3 days and to file claims within a fixed period of time. If other collateral sources of help are available, such as private insurance, compensa- tion is paid only to the extent that the collateral resource does not cover the loss. How can a State compensation program receive a VOCA grant? A State is eligible to receive a VOCA compensation grant if it meets the criteria set forth in VOCA and OVC's Pro- gram Guidelines. Examples of such criteria include pro- viding services for Federal crime victims and assisting victims who are victimizedwithin the State when the vic- tim resides in another State. Which States receive VOCA compensation grants? In FY 1995, 48 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands received VOCA compensation grants. The State of Maine will be eligible to receive grants in FY 1996. The State of Nevada does not participate. How are VOCA compensation grants determined? Each eligible State receives a VOCA compensation grant that is equal to 40 percent of the amount of compensation payments made by the State in a previous fiscal year. VICTIM ASSISTANCE What is victim assistance? Victim assistance includes services such as crisis inter- vention, counseling, emergency transportation to court, temporary housing, and criminal justice support and ad- vocacy. Throughout the Nation, there are over 8,000 or- ganizations that provide these and other services to crime victims. Nearly 3,000 of those organizations re- ceive some VOCA funds. How can a State receive a VOCA victim assistance grant? All States, the District of Columbia~ the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and Palau (herein- after referred to as States) are eligible to receive a VOCA victim assistance grant. Each State (except Palau) receives a base amount of $200,000. The remainder of the Fund that is available VOCA assistance grants is then distributed according to population data. Upon receiving the VOCA grant, each State awards these funds to.public and nonprofit organizations to provide ser- vices to victims of crime. How do States determine which organizations will receive VOCA grants? Each State has discretion to determine which organiza- tions will receive funding based upon the VOCA victim assistance guidelines and the needs of crime victims within the State. However, VOCA assistance funds can be used only for direct services to crime victims. Services such as of- fender rehabilitation, criminal justice improvements, and crime prevention aCtivities cannot be supported with VOCA assistance funds. DISCRETIONARY FU N DS How are the training and technical assistance discretionary funds used? The purpose of the discretionary grant program is to im- prove and enhance the availability of victim services. Each year, the Director of OVC develops a program plan to assist professionals and volunteers to better serve crime victims. The program plan identifies a number of specific topic areas to be funded on a competitive basis. At least half of all discretionary grant funds are dedicated to improving the response to Federal crime victims. Initia- tives include training Federal criminal justice system per- sonnel on victims issues, developing materials that help victims understand their rights and available services, and supporting programs that establish and expand exist- ing services for Federal crime victims. The remaining discretionary grant funds support a variety of nationwide initiatives such as developing training cur- riculums, training victim services and criminal justice pro- fessionals, working to raise the awareness of victim rights and needs throughout the country, and supporting a na- tional clearinghouse on victim-related issues.

For Helen, getting physical therapy meant time away from work, and getting treatment for her depression meant counseling that she could not af- ford. She did not know that her State's victim compensation program would pay for crime-related expenses. 984 Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) established the Victims Fund in the U.S. Treasury. This fund re- ceives fines, penalty assessments, and bond forfeitures from convicted Federal criminalsmnot taxpayers. It is ad- ministered by the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) and helps to support State compensation programs for crime victims. All 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, and Guam have established victim compensation pro- grams. Each of these programs reimburse victims of vio- lent crime for expenses such as lost wages and medical, counseling, and funeral costs that are not covered by other resources such as medical insurance or offender restitution. Although each State compensation program is adminis- tered independently, most programs have similar eligibil- ity requirements and offer a comparable range of benefits. Maximum awards generally range between $10,000 and $25,000.. Some.States have higher or lower award limits. Certain expenses are not covered by most compensation programs. These include property loss, theft, and damage. To be eligible to receive compensation, victims must com- ply with State rules, which generally require that they co- operate with the reasonable requests of law enforcement and submit a timely application with the State compensa- tion program. Each year, OVC uses VOCA funds to supplement state resources that are dedicated to compensating crime vic- tims. States receive a grant based on 40 percent of the amount of compensation payments made by the State in a previous year. From 1986 through 1994, State com- pensation programs have received more than $415.9 mil- lion in VOCA grant funds.

With no resources of her own, she knew leaving him would not be easy, She called her local domestic violence shelter, which provided housing and counseling for her and the children and'helped her obtain a restraining order. hroughout the United States, more than 8,000 organiza- bns provide services to crime victims like Maria. These organizations include domestic violence shelters, rape crisis centers, child abuse programs, victim services in law enforcement agencies and prosecutor's offices, hos- pitals, and social service agencies. The services provided include crisis intervention, counseling, emergency shel- ter, court notification, case information, and referral for services. These services are funded in part by the Federal Government. The 1984 Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) established the Crime Victims Fund in the U.S. Treasu. ry. This Fund re- ceives fines, penalty assessments, and bond forfeitures from convicted Federal criminals--not taxpayers. The Office for Victims of Crime oversees the distribution of these dollars and uses part of the money to award an- nual victim assistance grants to the States. States, in turn, award VOCA subgrants to nearly 3,000 commun!ty- based public and private nonprofit organizations that serve crime victims. All States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau receive an annual VOCA vic- tim assistance grant. Each State and Territory (except Palau) receives a base amount of $200,000. The remain- der of the available funds are then distributed to the States on the basis of population. From 1986 through 1994, States and Territories have re- ceived more than $477.7 million in VOCA victim assis- tance grant funds. States and Territories are required to give priority to pro- grams serving victims of domestic violence, sexual as- sault, and child abuse. Additional funds must be set aside for other violent crime victims such as survivors of homicide victims and victims of intoxicated drivers.

Foreword Our children are our most tmportant resource, and providing a safe environment for them is our most important responsibility. When a child is reported missing or victimized, our response as a society must be swift, efficient, and effective. Faced with reduced budgets and high violent crime rates, state and local law enforcement are often unable to actively investigate missing children cases on a long-term basis. In stranger abduction cases, where victim life expectancy often can be measured in hours, local law enforcement is under incredible pressure to recover the child immediately. All missing and exploited children cases, whether short or long-term, can strain the resources of the investigating agency. Consequently, it is critical for information about Federal programs and services to be available so that local law enforcement can request them when needed. This directory was prepared by the Federal Agency Task Force for Missing and Exploited Children and represents the Task Force's initial efforts to enhance the coordination of the delivery of Federal services to missing and exploited children and their families. Designed to provide information about Federal resources, the directory is a compilation of the many services, programs, publications, and training that address issues of child sexual exploitation, child pornography, child abductions, and missing children cases. The directory contains information ranging from access to specialized forensic resources for an abducted child case, to proactive training and prevention programs. It is the Task Force's hope that child-serving professionals and law enforcement will find this publication to be a valuable supplement and that it will enhance their activities and programs for missing and exploited children. I invite you to make use of this directory as we all work to protect our Nation's children.

Introduction Creation of the Federal Agency Task Force for Missing and Exploited Children was announced by Attorney General Janet Reno on May 25, 1995, at the 12th Annual Missing Children's Day. The mission of the Task Force is to coordinate Federal resources and services to effectively address the needs of missing, abducted, and exploited children and their families. The Task Force: Serves as an advocate for missing and exploited children and their families. Initiates positive change to enhance services and resources for missing and exploited children, their families, and the agencies and organizations that serve them. Promotes communication and cooperation among agencies and organizations at the Federal level. Serves as the focal point for coordination of services and resources. The Task Force includes representatives from 14 Federal agencies and one private agency that work directly with cases involving missing, abducted, and exploited children and their families. As used in this guide, the term \"missing child\" refers to any youth under the age of 18 whose whereabouts are unknown to his or her legal guardian. This includes children who have been abducted or kidnaped by a family member or a nonfamily member, a child who has run away from home, a child who is a throwaway, or a child who is otherwise missing. It also includes both national and international abductions. The term \"child exploitation\" refers to any child under the age of 18 who has been exploited or victimized for profit or personal advantage. This includes children who are victims of pornography, prostitution, sexual tourism, and sexual abuse. Members of the Task Force are acutely aware of the tremendous pressure placed on people who handle these types of cases on an ongoing basis. The devastating impact on the child, family, community, and practitioner; the gravity and severity of these offenses; and the overwhelming amount of time required to resolve such cases often place unfair burdens and challenges on those responsible for case investigations. Yet, when a child is missing, abducted, or victimized, an immediate and continual response is key to the successful resolution of a case. In response to these concerns, the Task Force developed this resource manual to contribute support and to provide real solutions to practitioners when they most need them. This manual contains information on the resources, technical assistance and support, and services that are available during the investigation of cases involving missing and exploited children. The manual describes the role of each Task Force agency in the location and recovery of missing and exploited children, the types of services and support that are available, the procedures for accessing these services, and instructions for obtaining additional information. To make the information accessible, the next section, \"Where To Get Help,\" categorizes the type of assistance offered by each agency. In addition, telephone quick reference cards can be removed and kept where most needed; addresses and phone numbers are correct as of the date of publication.

The goal is to help young people avoid long-term dependency on social services. Discretionary funds are awarded to local agencies that provide youth with comprehensive services in a supervised living arrangement. The first TLP projects were funded in fiscal year 1990. To date, 86 projects have been funded.

Federal law defines children as minors under the age of 18, often referred to as \"children of tender years.\" FBI investigations generally involve violations of Federal statutes relating to child abuse, sexual exploitation of children, interstate transportation of obscene material, computer pornography, and interstate transportation of children for sexual activity. In some instances, the RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) statute also may apply. Cases related to the sexual abuse and exploitation of children are given high priority. All available and necessary FBI resources are used during these investigations, and each case is aggressively prosecuted. Nonfamily abductions, often referred to as stranger abductions, receive immediate attention. Particular attention is also given to investigations involving organized criminal activity, commercialized child prostitution, and the manufacture and distribution of child pornography. The transmission and exchange of child pornography through computer bulletin boards has been aggressively investigated as an insidious form of child sexual exploitation. Historically the FBI has also investigated allegations of sexual assault on Indian reservations. That jurisdiction has been broadened to include felonious sexual molestation of children. The FBI has effectively addressed these sensitive investigations by participating in a multidisciplinary team approach that enlists the expertise of investigators, social workers, clinical psychologists, victim- witness coordinators, and Federal prosecutors. Services Investigative Services FBI Field Offices. Individual FBI field offices throughout the country serve as the primary point of contact for persons requesting FBI assistance. Special agents assigned to the violent crime squads within those offices use all available resources--including investigative, forensic, tactical, informational, and behavioral science--in the investigation. The special agents coordinate their investigations with appropriate local law enforcement agencies, as well as with Federal or State prosecutors. Upon receiving notification that a minor child has been abducted, FBI Evidence Response Team personnel may be assigned immediately to conduct the forensic investigation of the abduction site, while other special agents typically join law enforcement personnel in coordinating and conducting the comprehensive neighborhood investigation that is vital to the resolution of these cases. A Rapid Start Team may also be deployed immediately to begin the overwhelming task of coordinating and tracking the investigative leads, which often number in the thousands during protracted child abduction investigations. Special agents will also coordinate child abduction investigations with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and other entities to make full use of all available resources. 33 Child Abduction and Serial Killer Unit. The Child Abduction and Serial Killer Unit (CASKU) is a rapid response element of the FBI's Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG). The unit has primary responsibility for providing investigative support through violent crime analysis, technical and forensic resource coordination, and application of the most current expertise available in matters involving the abduction or mysterious disappearance of children and serial and mass murder. (Serial murder involves the killing of two or more victims at separate locations; mass murder is the killing of four or more victims in the same event and at the same location.) Child abductions are among the most difficult crimes to resolve and require immediate dedication of significant resources. Specialized CASKU staff provide operational assistance to Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies involved in these important investigations. The unit responds immediately to requests and provides onsite assistance as appropriate. CASKU services include: Crime analysis. Investigative strategies. Interview and interrogation strategies. Analysis of the behavioral characteristics of unknown offenders. Trial preparation and prosecutive strategy. Expert testimony. Coordination of other resources, including FBI Evidence Response Teams and FBI laboratory services. Case consultations may include any or all of the services listed above. Services are provided by telephone, in writing, or in person. In some cases investigators may travel to Quantico for consultation sessions, or CASKU members may be sent to the area of the crimes. CASKU can also assist in coordinating the deployment of Rapid Start, a computerized major case management support system. CASKU maintains a close working relationship with NCMEC and can help to arrange the use of their resources, such as poster distribution and age enhancement of photographs. Another CIRG component, the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (VICAP), works closely with CASKU and provides automated support. To assist investigators working on cases, VICAP analysts perform standard and ad hoc searches of their databases, as well as other law enforcement databases. The VICAP database contains reports submitted by participating law enforcement agencies concerning certain violent crimes, which can be used to analyze and link multiple cases. Morgan P. Hardiman Task Force on Missing and Exploited Children. Created by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the Morgan P. Hardiman Task Force on Missing and Exploited Children coordinates Federal law enforcement resources to assist State and local authorities in investigating the most difficult cases of missing and exploited children. The Task Force is composed of at least two members from each of seven Federal agencies: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; Drug Enforcement Administration; FBI; U.S Customs Service; U.S. '34 Marshals Service; U.S. Postal Inspection Service; and U.S. Secret Service. As legislated by Congress, the FBI manages the Task Force, which is located with CASKU and therefore works closely with that unit. The unit chief of CASKU also serves as chief of the Task Force. FBI Forensic and Technical Support Services CASKU was created to centralize services in child abduction and serial homicide cases. In addition to providing investigative consultation, CASKU can coordinate the application of all FBI headquarters resources needed in particular cases. The FBI laboratory is the only full-service Federal forensic science laboratory serving the law enforcement community. The FBI is mandated by Title 28, CFR Section 0.85, to conduct scientific examinations of evidence, free of charge, for any duly constituted law enforcement agency in the United States. Assistance is provided through: Evidence response teams. Document services. Latent fingerprint services. Scientific analysis services (including chemistry-toxicology, DNA analysis/serology examinations, explosives, firearms-toolmarks, hairs and fibers, and materials analysis). Special projects (including graphic design, photographic processing, special photographic services, structural design and visual production, and video enhancement). Forensic science research and training. Detailed information about these services, including instructions for collecting, preserving, and shipping evidence, can be found in the Handbook of Forensic Science, which is available from the Government Printing Office. The FBI's Rapid Start Team, which was developed since the Handbook was last revised, provides onsite information management services to support the handling of crisis situations. The team is a self-contained unit capable of operating in a bivouac environment, bringing with them all equipment required. The Special Techniques Program, established in 1993, is another part of the Information Resources Division/Engineering Section. This group uses geophysical methodology and other remote sensing equipment to search for clandestinely concealed evidence. These techniques are considered as an investigative tool only after more expedient measures have been exhausted. Criminal Justice Information Services. Criminal justice information services provided by the FBI include a fingerprint repository and the National Crime Information Center (NCiC). Fingerprint repository. The FBI serves as the Nation's civil and criminal fingerprint repository and responds to the information needs of Federal, State, local, and international members of the criminal justice community. The FBI receives more than 34,000 fingerprint cards each day. 35 National Crime Information Center. NCIC is a nationwide computer-based inquiry and response information system that was established in 1967 to serve the criminal justice community. NCIC's purpose is to maintain a computerized filing system of accurate, timely, documented criminal justice information that is readily available through a telecommunications network. An average of 1.3 million inquiry-response transactions per day are processed through more than 100,000 NCIC terminals. The Handbook of Forensic Science describes technical services of the Criminal Justice Information Services Division and the Information Resources Division of the FBI. Training The FBI offers an extensive training program for the law enforcement community. Training in a broad spectrum of topics is offered to bona fide law enforcement personnel in settings around the country, as well as at the FBI Academy. Each FBI field office has a training coordinator to assist law enforcement agencies in obtaining the desired training. Victim- Witness Assistance Each FBI field office has a victim-witness coordinator. However, the FBI's Victim-Witness Assistance Program operates on a referral-only basis for victims of Federal violations. The FBI does not have the authority to provide financial compensation to crime victims, although it can refer victims to local and State agencies receiving grants from the Department of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime (see appendix 6). Availability of Services Recipients of FBI services include law enforcement agencies and the U.S. Government (hence the citizens of the United States). Services can be accessed by a request from a law enforcement agency, either through the Child Abduction and Serial Killer Unit or through the local FBI field office. Legislative Citations FBI services are provided in Federal violations of Federal statutes, including kidnaping (Title 18, U.S. Code, Sections 1201 and 1202); crimes committed on Indian reservations; child abuse (Title 18, U.S. Code, Sections 2241, 2242, 2243, and 2244); sexual exploitation of children (Sections 2251, 2251A, 2252, and 2258); interstate transportation of obscene material (Sections 1462, 1465, and 1466); interstate transportation of children for sexual activity (Sections 2421, 2422, 2423, and 2424); and in some instances the RICO statute (Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1961). Services also are provided in local violations when requested by the investigating agency.

Washington, DC 20535-0001 Telephone: (202) 324-4294 37 38 U.S. Department of lustice Office for Victims of Crime Agency Description The mission of the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) is to enhance the Nation's capacity to assist crime victims and to provide leadership in order to change attitudes and practices to promote justice and healing for all victims of crime. OVC administers the Crime Victims Fund (hereafter called the Fund), which was authorized by the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA). Financing for the Fund comes from criminal fines, forfeited bail bonds, penalty fees, and special assessments collected by U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Courts, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Each year OVC makes awards to State Crime victim assistance and compensation programs to supplement State funding for victim services. In addition, OVC provides victim assistance training and technical assistance for criminal justice officials and direct service providers. Exploited children, families of missing and exploited children, practitioners who provide direct services to victim families, and law enforcement personnel who investigate and prosecute such cases are eligible to participate in OVC-sponsored programs. Services Crime Victim Compensation Crime victim compensation is the direct payment to a crime victim or to his or her family to help cover crime-related expenses such as medical treatment, mental health counseling, lost wages, or funeral services. Every State administers a crime victim compensation program. Most of these programs have similar eligibility requirements and offer a comparable range of benefits. Most programs require victims to report crimes to the police in a timely manner and to file claims within a fixed period of time. Each year OVC uses VOCA funds to supplement State resources. States receive a grant based on 40 percent of the amount of compensation benefits made by the State in a previous year. Crime Victim Assistance Crime victim assistance programs provide direct services such as crisis intervention, counseling, emergency transportation to court, temporary housing, and criminal justice support and advocacy. All States receive VOCA victim assistance grant funds, which are then awarded by the States to community-based public and nonprofit organizations that serve crime victims, such as domestic violence shelters, child abuse treatment programs, victim service units in law enforcement agencies and prosecutor's offices, hospitals, and social service agencies. Each State receives a base amount of $200,000, plus a percentage of the amount remaining in the Fund based on population. Training and Technical Assistance OVC's Trainers Bureau seeks to improve services to crime victims by providing training and 39 technical assistance to the programs and agencies that serve crime victims. The Trainers Bureau helps Federal, State, and local agencies address training, administrative, and programmatic issues. Immediate Response to Emerging Problems OVC's Immediate Response to Emerging Problems (IREP) program seeks to improve services to communities that have experienced crimes involving multiple victimizations. The program provides rapid response and limited technical assistance to victim service agencies; Federal, State, and local criminal justice agencies; U.S. Attorney's Offices; Native American tribes; and other agencies that assist crime victims. Information Dissemination OVC's Resource Center provides victim-related information to criminal justice practitioners, researchers, policymakers, and crime victims. The OVC Resource Center collects, maintains, and disseminates information on national, State, and local victim-related organizations and on State programs that receive funds authorized by VOCA. The OVC Resource Center is a component of the National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS), the world's largest criminal justice information clearinghouse. Availability of Services OVC services are directed to: Missing and exploited children and their families. Victims of child pornography. Victims of sexual tourism. Parents of abducted children. Federal, State, and local criminal justice officials and other professionals who handle cases of missing and exploited children. Members of the general public who have an interest in child-victim information. State crime victim compensation applications can be obtained from the appropriate State program. A list of agencies responsible for the administration of crime victims compensation in each State can be found in appendix 6. Crime Victim Assistance Crime victim assistance programs in each State are fundedthrough State VOCA funds. A list of local crime victim assistance programs is available from each State VOCA victim assistance administrator (see appendix 6). 40 Training and Technical Assistance Programs and agencies can access OVC's Trainers Bureau by submitting a request on agency letterhead that: (1) describes the problem to be addressed and explains why it cannot be funded with existing resources, (2) provides information about the individuals to be trained, (3) estimates the number of hours of training or the number of days of technical assistance needed, (4) details the expected outcome of the assistance, and (5) indicates what special skills or knowledge are required of the trainer or assistance provider. If the request is approved for funding, OVC will match trainers and/or technical assistance providers to the request. For additional information, write to the Trainers Bureau at the OVC address below or call (202) 307-5983. Immediate Response to Emerging Problems Agencies and communities can access OVC's IREP program by submitting a request on agency letterhead that: (1) contains a statement of facts concerning the situation, (2) enumerates the number of victims and describes the impact of the crime on the community, (3) explains why existing resources are inadequate, (4) describes the type of technical assistance requested and the desired outcome, and, if known, (5) lists any special skills required by the consultants. If approved, onsite assistance usually will be short-term, generally from 1 to 3 days. For additional information, write to the IREP program at the OVC address below or call (202) 307-5983.

Washington, DC 41 42 U.S. Department of ]ustice Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Missing and Exploited Children's Program Agency Description The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (JJDP) Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-415), as amended by the Missing Children's Assistance Act of 1984, establishes the Missing and Exploited Children's Program in the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). The purpose of the Missing Children's Assistance Act is to develop leadership and provide funding support to address the needs of the Nation's missing children and their families and to foster coordination of programs and services for this population. The Missing and Exploited Children's Program conducts research, demonstration, and service programs pertaining to missing and exploited children; provides training and technical assistance; and coordinates various activities. In addition, the Missing and Exploited Children's Program supports the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the national resource center and clearinghouse dedicated to missing and exploited children issues. Since 1984, the Missing Children's Assistance Act has provided for research, training, and technical assistance to support local law enforcement efforts to locate and recover missing children. Each year the Missing and Exploited Children's Program trains more than 3,500 law enforcement officials in the investigation of missing children cases, at no cost to State or local governments. Services Training and technical assistance. Demonstration programs. Research projects. Evaluation studies. Publications. Funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Support for nonprofit organizations that work with missing and exploited children. Coordination of the Federal Agency Task Force for Missing and Exploited Children.

Room 550 Washington, DC 20531 Telephone: (202) 616-3637 Fax: (202) 307-2819 45 46 U.S. Department of lustice U.S. National Central Bureau (INTERPOL) Agency Description INTERPOL is the international criminal police organization that comprises designated national central bureaus (NCB's) from the law enforcement agencies of its 176 member nations. The primary mission of INTERPOL is: (a) To ensure and promote the widest possible mutual assistance between all criminal police authorities within the limits of the laws existing in the different countries and in the spirit of the 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights.' (b) To establish and develop all institutions likely to contribute effectively to the prevention and suppression of ordinary law crimes. By law, INTERPOL is forbidden to undertake any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious, or racial character. INTERPOL maintains a sophisticated global communications network to coordinate international criminal investigations among its member countries. This network is also used to relay humanitarian requests, such as missing person inquiries. INTERPOL provides a forum for discussions, organizes working group meetings, and stages symposia for law enforcement authorities of member nations to focus attention on the specific areas of criminal activity affecting their countries. Services Each INTERPOL member country establishes, funds, and staffs a national central bureau, which serves as the point of contact for the international law enforcement community. Every NCB operates within the parameters of its own nation's law and policies and within the framework of the INTERPOL constitution. In the United States, authority for the INTERPOL function rests with the Attorney General. Authority for administering the U.S. National Central Bureau (USNCB) is shared by the Departments of Justice and Treasury. The mission of USNCB is twofold: To receive foreign requests for criminal investigative assistance and direct them to the appropriate U.S. Federal, State, or local law enforcement or judicial authorities. To receive domestic law enforcement requests and direct them to the appropriate NCB abroad. The USNCB's coordinative services provide Federal, State, and local law enforcement authorities with the most effective means available to secure the assistance of foreign police in matters ranging from a criminal record check to the arrest and extradition of wanted persons. 47 The USNCB investigative staff includes senior agents who are detailed from more than 16 Federal and State law enforcement agencies. Agents work in five investigative divisions: alien/fugitive, criminal, drugs, financial fraud and economic crimes, and State liaison. Cases involving the exploitation of minors are assigned to one of these divisions, depending on the nature of the offense. For example, the financial fraud and economic crimes division investigates sexual abuse against minors, sexual assault against minors, child pornography, and sexual tourism; the alien/fugitive division is responsible for cases involving missing persons, parental kidnaping, and child abduction. Through INTERPOL's worldwide telecommunications network, messages can be directed to one country, to an entire region, or to the whole INTERPOL membership. Messages destined for regional or worldwide distribution are referred to as \"diffusions.\" Diffusions inform other NCB's of the circumstances of a case and request their assistance or intervention. If information is not obtained from other NCB's as a result of a diffusion message, the originating agency can request that a formal notice be issued for worldwide distribution through the INTERPOL Secretariat General Office. INTERPOL notices are categorized (color-coded) according to the circumstances surrounding the request. Red notices, also known as International Wanted Criminal Notices, request a subject's provisional arrest with a view toward extradition. A red notice provides specific details concerning charges against a subject, along with warrant information, and includes prior criminal history. Blue notices are designed to collect information about persons. For example, an investigator may need to verify a person's identity, obtain particulars about a person's criminal record, locate a person who has not been fully identified, or locate a wanted person whose extradition may be requested. Yellow notices are circulated to provide information about persons who are missing or who are unable to identify themselves. Upon receipt of these notices, most member countries enter the information into their databases and border lookout systems. Availability of Services Requests for Assistance To reach the international law enforcement community, USNCB enters information on the child- related crime, subject, victim, abducting parent, or missing child(ren) into the INTERPOL network. Requests can be made immediately following the incident, but they must be made by a U.S. law enforcement agency or judicial authority. USNCB cannot accept requests for assistance from members of the public, including a victim parent. Virtually every request normally handled through law enforcement channels can be accommodated by INTERPOL, provided communication is needed within the international law enforcement community. Generally, correspondents on INTERPOL messages are the law enforcement authorities in the respective member countries. 48 Responses to inquiries are sent to the originating law enforcement agency. Interested parties, such as a victim parent, can ask for a status report directly from the originating law enforcement agency. When a request is received, USNCB analysts search a wide range of internal and external computer databases to determine if there are any records that will disclose prior investigative information or if there is any information that will help to locate a missing or abducted child and/or the abducting parent. For example, databases operated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and by the U.S. Customs Service may reveal a person's entry into or exit from the United States. The USNCB's INTERPOL case tracking system is queried to determine if there is any prior correspondence regarding the principals in the investigation. An INTERPOL agent then determines what action should follow, and a message is usually sent to one or more foreign NCB's through the INTERPOL communications network. Because local customs, policies, and laws dictate what the receiving NCB can and will do, USNCB has little or no control over how a message will be handled by a foreign NCB. Most requests from U.S. police entail interviewing witnesses, victims, or subjects of child exploitation crimes who reside in foreign countries or concern efforts to locate missing or abducted children and/or abductors. Child Abduction Cases In child abduction cases, the initial request seeks to confirm if border-entry records can establish the presence of the abductor or the child in the foreign country. Once entry has been established, discreet verification is requested to confirm the exact location of the abductor in the hope of preventing that person from fleeing to another location. If an NCB confirms the location of an offender, abductor, or child, USNCB notifies the originating police agency, which then coordinates subsequent investigative or retrieval efforts with the prosecuting attorney or the victim parent. If USNCB messages fail to locate an offender, abductor, or child, USNCB helps the originating agency complete the application process that will lead to the publication of INTERPOL international notices. If a child is located abroad, the issue of custody is usually resolved through the civil court system or through diplomatic processes. INTERPOL does not have the authority to request protective custody of the child, even in countries that are party to the Hague Convention treaty. If a subject is charged with a child exploitation offense, a request for provisional arrest with a view toward extradition must be sent first through the proper diplomatic channels. Cases resulting in extradition are handled by the Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs, which uses the INTERPOL channel to transmit information pertaining to the extradition process. Foreign Requests for Assistance Foreign requests for investigative assistance are handled similarly to domestic cases. USNCB analysts query various law enforcement databases--including the NCIC database and the Customs Service's Treasury Enforcement Computer System (TECS)--and appropriate immigration systems to determine whether prior investigative information exists in the United States. The investigative request is then forwarded to the appropriate Federal or State police authority. The results of such investigative actions are then routed back to USNCB for relay to the requesting country. If another NCB requests such action, USNCB can initiate a border-lookout notice using the TECS database. Such a notice 49 would request that INTERPOL be notified if the subject were to attempt to enter the United States, although no enforcement action could be taken. In foreign origin abduction cases, the names of the abductor and of the child cannot be entered into the NCIC computer system unless a red notice has been issued for the abductor and a yellow notice for the child. In some cases USNCB can enter the victim child's name into NCIC without the. existence of a yellow notice, but all efforts to locate the child must have been exhausted previously, and the request for such entries must be made by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Agency Contact For further information about services, contact: U.S. National Central Bureau (INTERPOL) U.S. Department of Justice Bicentennial Building Room 600 600 E Street NW. Washington, DC 20530 Telephone: (202) 616-9000 Fax: (202) 616-8400 NLETS: DCINTER00 50 U.S. Department of State Office of Children's Issues Agency Description The Office of Children's Issues (CI) is located in the Overseas Citizens Services, Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State. CI formulates, develops, and coordinates policies and programs and provides direction to foreign service posts on international parental child abduction and international adoption. CI also fulfills U.S. treaty obligations relating to the abduction of children. Services The Office of Children's Issues provides services in two areas: international abduction and international adoption. International Abduction CI works closely with parents, attorneys, private organizations, and government agencies in the United States and abroad to prevent international abductions. Since the late 1970's, the Bureau of Consular Affairs has taken action in more than 8,000 cases of international parental child abduction. In addition, the Office has answered thousands of inquiries concerning international child abduction, enforcement of visitation rights, and abduction prevention techniques. CI acts as the U.S. Central Authority for the operation and implementation of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Forty-one countries, including the United States, have joined the Hague Abduction Convention, which discourages abduction as a means of resolving a custody matter by requiring, with a few limited exceptions, that the abducted child be returned to the country where he or she resided prior to the abduction. In 1994 CI received more than 800 applications for assistance under the Hague Abduction Convention, 60 percent of which involved children abducted from the United States and taken to other countries, and 40 percent of which involved children who were abducted in other countries and brought to the United States. The countries with the most abduction cases are, in descending order, Mexico, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and France. These five countries account for about half of the abduction cases in which CI becomes involved. Many countries have not yet accepted the Hague Convention. In 1994 CI handled the cases of more than 250 children who were abducted to non-Hague countries. In the event of an abduction to a non- Hague country, one option for the left-behind parent is to obtain legal assistance in the country where the child was taken and to follow the local judicial process. Of non-Hague countries, the largest number of cases have involved children taken to Egypt, Japan, Jordan, the Philippines, and Saudi Arabia. For international abduction cases, CI can: Provide information in situations where the Hague Convention applies and help parents file an application with foreign authorities to obtain the return of or access to the child. 51 Attempt to locate, visit, and report on a child's general welfare in non-Hague cases by contacting U.S. Embassies and consulates abroad. Provide the left-behind parent with information on the legal system, especially concerning family law, of the country to which the child was abducted and furnish a list of attorneys willing to accept American clients. Provide a point of contact for the left-behind parent. Monitor judicial or administrative proceedings overseas. Help parents contact local officials in foreign countries or make contact with such officials on the parent's behalf. Inform parents of domestic remedies, such as warrants, extradition procedures, and U.S. passport revocations. Alert foreign authorities to any evidence of child abuse or neglect. CI cannot re-abduct a child, help a parent in any way that violates the laws of another country, or give refuge to a parent who is involved in re-abduction. CI also cannot act as a lawyer, represent parents in court, or pay legal expenses or court fees. International Adoption CI offers general information and assistance regarding the adoption process in more than 60 countries. In 1994 U.S. citizens adopted more than 8,000 foreign-born children. Because adoption is a private legal matter within the judicial sovereignty of the Nation where the child resides, the Department of State cannot intervene on behalf of an individual U.S. citizen in foreign courts. For international child adoption cases, CI can: Provide information about international adoption in countries around the world. Provide general information on U.S. visa requirements for international adoptions. Make inquiries regarding the status of specific adoption cases and clarify documentation and other requirements to the U.S. consulate abroad. Ensure that U.S. citizens are not discriminated against by foreign authorities or court personnel. CI cannot become directly involved in the adoption process in another country, cannot act as an attorney or represent adoptive parents in court, and cannot order that an adoption take place or that a visabe issued. 52 Availability of Services International Abduction In cases involving international abduction, services are directed to the parents or the attorneys of children who have been abducted internationally or to those who fear a child may be abducted by another parent abroad. CI works closely with local and Federal law enforcement agencies, the Department of Justice, and the Department of State Legal Advisors Office, all of which pursue criminal remedies to international parental abduction cases. General information on international parental child abduction and custody issues is available to any interested person. As the U.S. Central Authority for the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, CI processes applications from parents seeking access to and the return of abducted children under the Convention. The International Child Remedies Act (42 U.S.C. 11601; P.L. 100-300; 22 CFR Part 94) is the Federal legislation implementing the Hague Abduction Convention in the United States. A Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Departments of State and Justice and by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children gives NCMEC the authority to process Hague abduction cases involving children taken to the United States. Although the Convention does not require that requests for services be in the form of an application, CI has created a special form (DSP-105), \"Application for Assistance Under the Hague Convention on Child Abduction,\" to help organize information (see appendix 7). It should be noted that CI does not adjudicate the validity of the application claim for the return of or access to a child; rather, CI provides information on the operation of the treaty and on the issues that the appropriate judicial or administrative body that reviews the application will consider in making a determination. International Adoption International adoption services provided by Cl are directed to parents seeking to adopt abroad, to agencies involved in international adoption, and to U.S. Embassies or consulates abroad that provide information on the local adoption situation and that issue visas to children to enter the United States. Most services are accessed when a parent calls CI or uses the automated information system. Any individual, agency, or group wanting information on international adoption may contact CI to obtain information. Under guidance from CI, Embassies and consulates monitor and report changes in local adoption procedures that may affect U.S. citizens wishing to adopt abroad. The Embassies also inform other governments of the effect that their laws, regulations, and procedures have on Americans who wish to adopt a child who resides in that country. 53 Agency Contact For further information about services, contact: Office of Children's Issues Room 4811 Overseas Citizens Services Bureau of Consular Affairs U.S. Department of State Washington, DC 20520-4818 Telephone: (202) 647-2688 647-9225 (modem number) Internet Gopher Address: DOSFAN.LIB.UIC.EDU 54 U.S. Department of Treasury U.S. Customs Service Agency Description The U.S. Customs Service is on the frontline of the Nation's defense against the illegal importation and trafficking of child pornography. Long recognized by both the domestic and international law enforcement communities for its knowledge of and skill in the area of child pornography investigations, the U.S. Customs Service aggressively targets importers, distributors, and purveyors of child pornography to prevent the sexual exploitation and abuse of children both in the United States and abroad. The U.S. Customs Service Child Pornography Enforcement Program works closely with the FBI, the Department of Justice's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Through an agreement with NCMEC, the U.S. Customs Service Child Pornography Enforcement Program has assumed primary responsibility for all NCMEC child pornography-related complaints. NCMEC has established a national toll-free child pornography Tipline (1-800-THE LOST, or 1-800- 843-5678) for the reporting of information regarding child pornography. NCMEC refers such data directly to the Child Pornography Enforcement Program for dissemination to the appropriate field offices. Services Training for law enforcement officers who are involved in child pornography investigations. Investigative support for child pornography investigations. Information dissemination to the public. Availability of Services Services available through the U.S. Customs Service are directed to law enforcement officials, investigators, and parents involved in cases of child pornography.

Specially trained postal inspectors are assigned to each of the 30 field divisions nationwide (see appendix 9). As Federal law enforcement agents, U.S. postal inspectors carry firearms, serve warrants and subpoenas, and possess the power of arrest. Recognizing that child molesters and child pornographers often seek to communicate with one another through what they perceive as the security and anonymity provided by the U.S. mail, postal inspectors have been involved extensively in child sexual exploitation and pornography investigations since 1977. Since the Federal Child Protection Act of 1984 was enacted, postal inspectors have conducted more than 2,600 child pornography investigations, resulting in the arrest and conviction of more than 2,300 child pornographers and preferential child molesters. Services Postal inspectors in the United States use an established, nationwide network of intelligence to implement a wide variety of undercover programs designed to identify suspects and develop prosecutable cases. These undercover operations recognize the clandestine nature of their targets and the inherent need of many offenders to validate their behavior. The techniques used in these programs include placement of contact advertisements in both local and national publications, written contacts and correspondence with the subject, and more recently, contact via computer bulletin boards. Postal inspectors are ready to assist in any related investigation involving child sexual exploitation. Availability of Services Investigative assistance by the Postal Inspection Service is available and should be sought under the following circumstances: a When a subject may be using the U.S. mail to exchange, send, receive, buy, loan, advertise, solicit, or sell child pornography. When a subject is believed to be using the U.S. mail to correspond with others concerning child sexual exploitation, child pornography, or child erotica. When a subject is believed to be using a computer network or bulletin board to exchange child pornography or child erotica or to correspond with others concerning child sexual exploitation, and the actual exchange or initial contact may involve the U.S. mail. When a subject is believed to be clearly predisposed to receive or purchase child pornography and a reverse sting investigative approach appears warranted. 59 When there is a need to execute a controlled delivery of child pornography. When the activities of a subject warrant further investigation and there is a need for assistance from a postal inspector who is trained in the investigation of child pornography or child sexual exploitation cases. When other local investigative leads have been exhausted and a postal inspector is needed to utilize additional resources. Services and investigative assistance provided by the Postal Inspection Service are available to any local, State, or Federal law enforcement agency. Contact the nearest office of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service for further information. Legislative Citations For over a century, the Postal Inspection Service has had specific responsibility for investigating the mailing of obscene matter (Title 18 U.S. Code, Section 1461). While over the years child pornography has been, as a matter of course, investigated along with obscenity matters, increased public concern resulted in the enactment of the Sexual Exploitation of Children Act of 1977 (Title 18 U.S. Code, Section 2251-2253). The Child Protection Act of 1984 (18 U.S.C. 2251-2255) amended the 1977 Act by: Eliminating the obscenity requirement. Eliminating the commercial transaction requirement. Changing the definition of a minor from a person under age 16 to one under age 18. Adding provisions for criminal and civil forfeiture. Amending the Federal wiretap statute to include the Child Protection Act. Raising the potential maximum fines from $10,000 to $100,000 for an individual and to $250,000 for an organization. On November 7, 1986, Congress enacted the Child Sexual Abuse and Pornography Act (18 U.S.C. 2251-2256), which amended the two previous acts by: Banning the production and use of advertisements for child pornography. Adding a provision for civil remedies of personal injuries suffered by a minor who is a victim. Raising the minimum sentence for repeat offenders from imprisonment of not less than 2 years to imprisonment of not less than 5 years. On November 18, 1988, Congress enacted the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act (18 U.S.C. 2251-2256), which: 60 Made it unlawful to use a computer to transmit advertisements for or visual depictions of child pornography. Prohibited the buying, selling, or otherwise obtaining temporary custody or control of children for the purpose of producing child pornography. On November 29, 1990, Congress amended 18 U.S.C. 2252, making it a Federal crime to possess three or more items containing child pornography that were mailed or shipped in interstate or foreign commerce or that were produced using materials that were mailed or shipped by any means, including by computer.

A private, nonprofit organization established in 1984, NCMEC operates under a congressional mandate in a cooperative agreement with the Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The goal is to coordinate the efforts of law enforcement personnel, social service agency staff, elected officials, judges, prosecutors, educators, and members of the public and private sectors to break the cycle of violence that historically has perpetuated crimes against children. Services NCMEC offers a variety of services to aid in the search for a missing child, including a toll-free hotline; technical case assistance; a national computer network; photograph and poster distribution; age-enhancement, facial reconstruction, and imaging-identification services; a resource directory of nonprofit organizations; recovery assistance; and international case assistance. Toll-Free Hotline One of NCMEC's primary activities is its toll-free hotline: 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678). The multilingual hotline, which is available throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico, operates every day of the year, 24 hours a day. It is used by individuals to report the location of a missing child or of other children whose whereabouts are unknown to the child's legal custodian and to learn about the procedures necessary to reunite a child with the child's legal custodian. Reports of missing children are entered immediately into a national missing child database. Reports of sightings of missing children are disseminated directly to the investigative agency handling the case. Technical Case Assistance Trained case managers assist citizens and law enforcement officials in filing missing person reports, verify data concerning missing children that have been entered into the FBI's NCIC computer system, and send publications designed to enhance the investigative skills of agency personnel involved in missing child cases. National Computer Network and Online Services NCMEC is linked via computer online services to 47 State clearinghouses, plus the District of Columbia, the U.S. Department of State Office of Children's Issues, the U.S. National Central Bureau (INTERPOL), the U.S. Secret Service Forensic Services Division, and other Federal agencies. Internationally, NCMEC is linked to the Australian Police, the Belgium Police, the Netherlands Police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, New Scotland Yard, Mexican government contacts, and others. These computer links allow images of and information on missing and exploited children to be transmitted instantly. 65 In addition, NCMEC has taken the search for missing children to the Internet with the creation of the Missing Children Web Page. This free, publicly available channel allows lnternet users to search a database for information on current missing children cases, to view images of missing children, and to obtain safety and resource information. The NCMEC Missing Children Web Page can be found at http://www, missingkids.org. Photograph and Poster Distribution NCMEC maintains an up-to-date library of missing children posters on the Internet, CompuServe, and the State Clearinghouse bulletin-board computer network. The organization also places missing child kiosks in high-traffic areas, such as airports and shopping malls. NCMEC simultaneously transmits posters and other case-related information to more than 6,500 law-enforcement agencies throughout the Nation through a broadcast fax dissemination service. NCMEC coordinates national media exposure of missing children cases, including public service announcements for breaking cases. Through a network of private-sector partners that includes major corporations, television networks, and publishers, NCMEC has distributed millions of photographs of missing children. Age-Enhancement, Facial Reconstruction, and Imaging-Identification Services Supported by forensic specialists and computer industry leaders, NCMEC provides computerized age- progression of photographs of long-term missing children, reconstructs facial images from morgue photographs of unidentified deceased individuals, provides assistance in the creation of artist composites, and trains forensic artists in imaging applications and techniques. Resource Directory of Nonprofit Organizations NCMEC maintains a list of nonprofit organizations located throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe that provide direct services (as stipulated by the Missing Children's Assistance Act) to families of missing and exploited children. This directory is provided as a public service to individuals who are looking for a resource group to help with a missing or exploited child case. Recovery Assistance Through NCMEC, several corporations provide lodging and transportation to custodial parents who are recovering their missing children. This service is available to parents or guardians who cannot afford such expenses themselves, provided that established criteria and guidelines are met. To find out if a particular case meets these criteria, call the NCMEC hotline. International Case Assistance NCMEC acts on behalf of the U.S. Central Authority in the handling of applications seeking the return of or access to children abducted in the United States. This assistance is provided in compliance with the Hague Convention of the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. NCMEC also handle s outgoing international abductio_ns. In addition, the following services are available to law enforcement agencies: Informational Analysis Services. NCMEC receives thousands of leads and provides law enforcement officials with the most usable, relevant information possible. NCMEC prioritizes its 66 leads and identifies similar patterns in cases across the country, helping to tie cases together and coordinate investigations. m Queries and Database Searches. Through its networked database, NCMEC can search active missing child cases using any series of identifiers. NCMEC also has access to a number of national informational databases, including employment records, motor vehicle records, telephone listings, school registrations, and the Federal Parent Locator Service. Project ALERT (America's Law Enforcement Retiree Team). Fourteen national law enforcement associations work with NCMEC to provide free onsite assistance by volunteer retired police officers. This project allows hardpressed local police involved in difficult missing or exploited child cases to benefit from the expertise of the retired officers. Working closely with crime prevention officers, NCMEC reaches out to the general public with positive, effective child-safety information and services, including: KIDS AND COMPANY: Together for Safety, a state-of-the-art personal safety curriculum for children in kindergarten through grade six. Project KidCare, a campaign to ensure that parents have a current photograph as well as descriptive information of their child. A list of safety tips is included in the passport-like booklet.

These cases include: Voluntary missing (runaway) cases, which can be taken immediately by NCMEC when the child is 13 or younger or when specific conditions indicate that the child is endangered, such as the existence of a life-threatening medical condition, a serious mental illness, a substance abuse problem, or a belief that the child is with a potentially dangerous individual or in a potentially dangerous situation. Family abduction cases, which are taken by NCMEC when it is determined that the parent reporting the case has court-awarded custody of the child and that the child's whereabouts are unknown. International family abduction eases, which are taken by NCMEC when it is believed that the child has been taken out of or brought into the United States and when the child's whereabouts are unknown, or when a child has been brought into the United States and the left-behind parent has made appropriate applications to invoke the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Nonfamily abduction eases, which may involve kidnaping by a stranger or by an acquaintance. Other cases, in which the facts are insufficient to determine the cause of a child's disappearance. The criteria for intake of a \"lost, injured, or otherwise missing\" child are the same as for a nonfamily abduction. For law enforcement professionals, requests for resources, technical assistance, and access to NCMEC's database may be obtained by contacting NCMEC's hotline or case management department.

NCMEC has joined forces with America's leading law enforcement associations to launch Project ALERT, a national program that uses retired law enforcement professionals as volunteers. Upon request by a law enforcement agency, NCMEC will assign a trained volunteer consultant to provide free, hands-on assistance to agencies struggling with missing child cases, child homicides, and child exploitation issues. Training Program Basic Investigative Guidelines: Missing and Abducted Children. This training program was developed by NCMEC to help local law enforcement agencies strengthen their efforts to solve missing and exploited child cases.

Associoflon of Missing == } USA 06498 ~'1~,+4~ O September 26, 1994 Dear Missing & Exploited Children's NPO: As President of the Board of Directors, together with my fellow Board members I am pleased to announce the incorporation of the \"Association of Missing and Exploited Children's Or#anizations (AMECO)\" Th0 signing of the incorporation papers took place on July 30, 1994 at 11:30 a.m. in the \"Lincoln Room\" of the Quality Hotel in Arlington, Virginia. AMECO is a reality - I congratulate everyone involved - we should all be very proud of this significant accomplishment. Looking back over our passage from simply a collection or individual missing children's organizations to formally associating ourselves as the Association of Missing and Exploited Children's Organizations, Inc. I realized the signing of the incorporation papers was the easiest part of the whole journey and I thank the many NPO's who contributed so much time, energy and insight to lay the foundation for AMECO. From the beginning it was evident that this would not be an easy task to accomplish. I am sure you will recall the times we gathered together to discuss the formation of a missing and exploited children's association. In particular the conferences in Washington, Albuquerque, Rend and Tucson where agency representatives met together to define objectives and design membership criteria and a Code of Ethics for our association. The cluster training In Arlington where we mastered computers and Fishkill where we learned mediation techniques - skills that were indispensable as we continued toward the incorporation of AMECO. Many hours were invested to further the quest towards better communication, cooperation, and the strengthening of our individual work through unified efforts. Bridges were crossed and doors were opened to positive networking and long lasting friendships. We have successfully progressed from the OJJDP's initial Washington D.C. \"Missin.q Children: Building Professional..Brid~qes Conforenc_o\" several years ago to the upcoming Minneapolis, Minnesota's i'Focus .o.n the Futu.re: A National Response to the Needs of Missin.q and Exploited Children and Their Families\" scheduled for October 13 - 15, 1994. I BBII I ~ B September 26, 1994 AMECO President's Letter Page Three I look forward to an exciting and successful future working together for all missing and exploited children and anticipate welcoming you as a charter member of the Association of Missing and Exploited Children's Organizations in Minneapolis in October. Enclosed you will find a membership application and other relevant information relating to AMECO. Please feel free to contact myself or another member of the Board of Directors with questions or comments. Again thank you for your support and encouragement and see you in Minneapolis in October.

USA 06498 Dear Member: June 19, 1996 R is a pleasure to be able to share with you our latest good news! I am reminded of a quote by John Wooden, who said, \"Do not let what you cannot do interfere with What you can do.\" Mr. Wooden would have been proud of AMECO and the perseveran.ce of its members. When we signed our Articles of Incorporation in July 1994 we anticipated funding to begin our national efforts. We were disappointed at not being awarded a grant but not defeated. On May 22, 1996 Susan Breault. on behalfofAMECO, received a letter of congratulations from Shay Bilchik of the Office ofluvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OLIDP) awarding AMECO a grant in the amount of $28,430. In applying for these monies the first objective under the category Program Strategy was stated to \"continue to develop AMECO to its full potential by employing a project consultant and support staffto build membership, ensure continuity and manage administration and program activities.\" To that end, I am pleased to announce that Ginny Mahoney of Mahoney Consulting Services has agreed to accept that challenge. A letter to each of you from Giany will be arriving shortly. The second grant objective and project consultant responsibility is 3-pronged: 1) 2) 3) To produce a standardized intake form; To produce a protocol for state-of-the-art communication between the NPO's and other organizations; and To produce a service-oriented newsletter for NPO's focusing on legislative and industry- related issues within the non-profit community. These arc ambitious goals but with everyone's energy and expertise we can reach than. The next good ne~ is the announcement of a Conference which will be held sometime around mid- Scptcmbcr. The time, place, and other details will be communicated when known. The Conference is being sponsored by OJJDP and is a joint effort between the non-profits and the clearinghouses. W\u00a2 will schedulc an AMECO meeting sometime during the Conference. More on this later. ! want to thank all ofyou who have expended time and energy during this period of foundation building. It brings new meaning to \"'Rome wasn't built in a day!\" I am excited about the journey ahead and look forward to seeing you all in September. 0 0 0 ~03LLE~E OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION AND FOX VALLEY TECHNICAL COLLEGE ()[rice of Juvenile 1996 ~..:.':'i!'::.:;;.::::::.::.::.:..:::::::...::::;:,::'::\":::.~; ' \" \" Wednesday, September 25 7:15 a.m. - 8:15 a.m. Registration 8:30 a.m. - 9:15 a.m. Welcome Remarks & Announcements Ron Laney - Director, Missing and Exploited Children's Program, OJJDP Wanda Keyes Heard - Executive Assistant, U.S. Attorney's Office, Middle District of Florida Cal Henderson - Sheriff, Hillsborough County, Florida, Sheriff's Department Tim Moore - Commissioner, Florida Department of Law Enforcement Shay Bilchik - Administrator, OJJDP 9:15 a.m. - 9:30 a.m. Break 0 0 0 09/17/96 FDLE Special 14:18 ~ FVTC / II ...............

From January to December 1979, Mr. Moore interrupted his FDLE career to further develop his professional and academic skills by attending and successfully completing a graduate program (with a 4.0 grade point average) in Public Administration at Georgia State University. Mr. Moore also possesses a ...Bachelor of Science degree in Criminology from Florida State University and is a fully certified, sworn law enforcement officer. Following his return to FDLE in January 1980, Mr. Moore advanced in the professional and managerial ranks and in July 1983 was appointed as Director of the Division of Crime Laboratories and Staff Services, becoming directly responsible for management and oversight of many operational and administrative activities. Mr. Moore became the chief lobbyist for the department and has played an integral part in FDLE's unprecedented growth and expansion, both in terms of resources and responsibilities. In June of 1986 Mr. Moore was again recognized for his knowledge of the law enforcement profession, versatility, and overall management abilities through his promotion to Deputy Commissioner of FDLE. Deputy Commissioner Moore continued his responsibilities as the chief lobbyist for FDLE and served as spokesman regarding FDLE activities and special issues before other criminal justice agencies, the Legislature, the Governor and Cabinet, various policy and advisory councils, other agencies, and the general public. Commissioner Moore is a member of numerous professional associations/boards, advisory committees, and councils both in Florida and nationally. On May 10, 1988, Commissioner Moore was selected from over 150 applicants nationwide and the Cabinet unanimously confirmed the nomination on June 2, 1988. As the state of Florida's top appointed law enforcement official, Commissioner Moore is tasked with overall management responsibilities for FDLE, an agency of over 1,500 members and an annual budget exceeding $130 million. Commissioner Moore is a strong proponent of an innovative, participatory, value-based management style while recognizing the importance of streamlining the Department's delivery of services in accordance with sound fiscal practices. This leadership style and the quality of FDLE members has made FDLE a cohesive team of widely diverse investigative, technical support, professional and managerial members whose collective productivity and impact on the state of Florida is second to none. 0 0 Q 09/20/96 17:05 FVTC / C.J.DEPT. -~-,-~ LANEY oo2/oo5 AMERICA WORKING TOGETHER TO BRING OUR CHILDREN HOME TAMPA, FL SEPTEMBER 25-27, t996 LOGISTICS Tuesday, September 24_ 8-10 pm Preregistration (Cammy and FDLE staff) Wednesday.

Your words inspire us and provide substance and meaning to our work as we return home. This has been a hard, intense three days. You are to be commended you for your attention and faithful attendance. We covered a lot of subjects. We learned how technology helps us do our jobs, where marketing can increase our effectiveness, how we enhance our services to missing children and their families, and critical need to work together. 0 0 \\ .,k The other day while driving home and listening to the radio, I heard ~ song by Keb Mo,,~ \u00a2/s-,~,~ ~ -/-,4esc ~,6rJ~-.' Well there's more than one way home. Ain't no wrong way --- Ain't no right way. And whatever road you might be on You fmd your own way Cause there's more than one way home. As I listened, it struck me that how much these words applied to what we all about. We represent all the ways our children can come b -\" /~ home. From nonprofit organizations to law enforcement, state clearinghouses to private corporations to government. Ain't no wrong way --Ain't no right way...There's more than one way home.

While we were here these three days, over 6900 children were reported missing to law enforcement in America. 2300 each day. We have our work cut out for us and I hope this workshop has provided a guiding vision and additional tools for you in this very important work. I'd like to close with this story. A tourist was walking down a deserted Mexican beach at stmset. As he walked along, he began to see another man in the distance. As he grew nearer, he noticed that the fisherman kept leaning down, picking something up and throwing it out into the water. Time and again he kept hurling things out into the ocean. As our tourist approached even nearer, he noticed that the man was picking up starfish that had been washed up on beach and, one at 0 0 0 time, he was throwing them back into the ocean. The tourist was puzzled. He approached the man and said, \"Good evening, friend. I was wondering what you are doing.\" \"I'm throwing these starfish back into the ocean. You see, it's low tide right now and all of these starfish have been washed up on the shore. IfI don't throw them back into the sea, they'll die up here from the lack of oxygen.\" \"I understand,\" my friend replied, \"but there must be thousands of starfish on this beach. You can't possibly get to all of them. There are simply too many. And don't you realize this is happening on hundreds of beaches all up and down this coast. Can't you see that that you can't possibly make a difference? The fisherman smiled, bent down and picked up yet another starfish, and as he threw it back into the sea, he replied, \"Made a difference 0 0 0 0 k to that one.\" Today, 2300 starfish washed up on the shores of America. I challenge you to continue to be that fisherman and work with your fellow fisherman. America Working Together to Bring our Children Home.

He has a 14-year-old female in custody, who refuses to identify herself. He's asking advice on how to proceed. What would you suggest? Th~wnaway--Team G Thanks to your suggestions the child has been identified as Tanya Jones. Her \"home\" address is believed to be in a city approximately 500 miles away, in another state. The sergeant has called that city's police department but has received little cooperation. How could you help him? 0 ID ID , Thrownaway--Team G Tanya has now been in custody for 5 hours. The city police department where Tanya lived has investigated and found that Tanya's father's whereabouts is unknown. Her mother is incarcerated on drug and prostitution charges. The sergeant is looking for solutions. He's afraid that Tanya will return to the street if she is not held securely. The only facility available to him is a local shelter, already overcrowded. What do you suggest should be done now? 0 0 0 . Thrownaway--Team G Tanya has finally opened up to a police officer. She has told the officer that her mother didn't want her and that she left home shortly before her mother was arrested. At first she stayed with friends. Then she stole. For the last six months she has been prostituting herself in a seedy part of town. The only real \"friends\" she has are her co-workers and her man, \"Jammie.\" She asks the police officer to call and see if Jammie will come get her. The officer has had little experience with this type of child. Can you offer any suggestions/assistance? 0 0 0 , ~,rownaway--Team G After much counseling and support, Tanya has agreed to testify against \"Jammie.\" Someone needs to plan for her future, however. Since you have been involved with her case from the beginning (now 60 days old), the local juvenile/family court judge is interested in your opinion. A court investigator has called and asked for your recommendations. Tanya has been found to be a \"dependent\" child and the court must decide what to do. Based on your knowledge and experience, what would you recommend? Could you help the court find a responsible relative? 0 0 0 . Thrownaway--Team G The Rest of the Story It appears as though Tanya is going to make it. Thanks to a check of driver's license data, Tanya's aunt was located in another state.

Vera was granted full custody due to Fred's drinking problem, among other reasons. The divorce was very bitter. Fred had a record of passing out drunk when he was supposed to be watching Alan. For the first two months Fred had visitation rights, Alan would be returned frightened and withdrawn. Supervised visitation was ordered. After two months of supervised visitation, one day while the supervisor was distracted, Fred grabbed Alan and ran out the door. Vera promptly notified police. It has now been 5 days and Vera is frantic. She is calling your organization asking for help. What can you do to help? Family Abduction ll--Team B The case has dragged on. It seems as though Alan has dropped off the face of the earth. Five years have gone by. Vera continues to look but it (the case) appears that the authorities are doing little or nothing. Vera has decided to hold a press conference on the doorway to the police department. She plans to blast the police for not finding her son.

The local police have contacted the Springfield Police Department but have not gotten a satisfactory response. According to local police, Springfield Police called the school and were told that there was no student at Springfield Elementary with Alan's last name. They refuse to do anything else.

What suggestions would you make? $256F96 ~Runaway--Team D Runaway Team D FacilitatormHelen Connelly LocationmNational Louis University Boardroom Your clearinghouse is contacted by a teacher at a junior high school in your state. The teacher has a 14-year-old boy in her class who has been placed in foster care by your state Department of Social Services (DSS). He had been picked up by the police because he was just wandering around the streets in a large city. The child claims that his parents abandoned him. He refuses to give authorities any information about his past or his parents. Other than his name, the only other information he has admitted is that he was born in Beatrice, Nebraska, on November 11. The teacher feels that there is more to the story. She feels the child is a runaway and she wants you to try to identify the child and locate his parents. After listening to the teacher and gathering the details, what steps do you take? \u00a2 11 , Runaway--Team D As a clearinghouse, you begin documenting your case opening. Following routine, you do an inquiry on NCIC using the name the child gave with a DOB of 11/11 and subtracting his age (14) from the current year to obtain a current DOB. You even search the year of birth on NCIC by 3 years, plus and minus. You receive \"negative\" results in all searches. You contact NCMEC and other NPOs to determine if they have any cases fitting the boy's description. Again, you come up with \"negative\" results. What can you do next? 0 0 0 ,Runaway--Team D You contact the Nebraska Clearinghouse and ask them to check with their Bureau of Vital Records in the town of Beatrice to determine if there is any record of birth for a child with the same name born on November 11, 14 years ago. You learn from the clearinghouse that there was a child with the same name born on 11/11 in Beatrice. You also obtain the birth mother's name and learn that she was born in Illinois. What are your next steps? 0 0 0 , Runaway--Team D You decide to contact the Illinois Clearinghouse to try and obtain some additional information on the \"mother.\" Searching through their state files, the Illinois Clearinghouse is able to provide you with the mother's date of birth. You perform a nationwide drivers license search. From the DMV search results you obtain a current address for the mother in Iowa. What do you do next? ~Runaway--Team D You contact the Iowa Clearinghouse. As soon as you mention the child's name, clearinghouse staff make the connection and tell you that the boy is a runaway from Iowa. The clearinghouse also tells you that the boy had been adopted. While on the run, however, he had been using his birth name, not his adoptive name. You learn that not only had the police agency entered the child on NCIC under his adoptive name only but they entered the wrong date of birth. At least now you know why you kept coming up with negative NCIC results. You also learn from the Iowa Clearinghouse that the boy had been a troubled youth. He had come from a family of six children. His natural father had been an alcoholic and had been very abusive. His mother was a typical victim of the domestic violence syndrome and did not provide the protection and stability the children needed. The boy and his younger brother were removed from the home and had been adopted. The boy had difficulty adapting to his new family and had run away. Now that you know you are dealing with a runaway situation, what is your next step? 0 0 0 Runaway--Team D You notify the investigating agency that the child is currently living in foster care in your state. Since you now know about the boy's troubled past and since the boy is in your state, even though it may be only for a short time now, what services can you offer him? 0 0 0 Runaway--Team D You contact your state Department of Social Services and the high school teacher and inform them of the complete story. You give them the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the child's caseworker in Iowa, the investigating officer, and the adoptive parents. You request that your state DSS provide counseling to the child to prepare him for his return to Iowa and you work with the Iowa Clearinghouse to oversee the child's reunification process so that the child receives follow-up counseling he so desperately needs. $256G96 0 0 0 Family Abduction--Team E Family Abduction Team E Facilitator--Roy Stephens LocationmNational Louis University Boardroom You receive a call from an angry man, George. He is upset because his son, Denzel (according to him), was kidnapped by his ex-wife, Erica, two years ago. He tells you he reported it to police but that they have done nothing. He asks for your help. What will be your course of action? 0 0 0 Family Abduction--Team E Your research into Denzel's case has revealed the following: Denzel is now six years old. He is believed to be living in Germany with his mother's family. Denzel's parents married when his father was stationed in Germany while serving with the U.S. Army. After moving back to the U.S., the marriage failed. Rather than wait for the courts to resolve the issues, Erika took Denzel and disappeared. When you checked with the responsible law enforcement agency, you found that Denzel was not entered into NCIC and that no case was initiated due to the fact that there was no custody order when it was initially reported. What should be done now? 0 0 0 Family Abduction--Team E Even though his is unemployed and has no financial resources, your suggestion to George that he contact Legal Aid and obtain custody has been followed. He has obtained legal custody of Denzel. The local police have opened a case and placed Denzel in NCIC. They have just called you because they are unsure what to do next. What would you suggest? b Ib Family Abduction--Team E Good news! Thanks to your suggestions, Denzel has been found, living with Erica's parents in Germany. He speaks little English, but, according to reports is healthy and happy. He had been told his father was dead. German authorities, cooperating with U.S. authorities, have convinced Erica's parents to voluntarily surrender Denzel to State Department Officials. The State Department has just called George with the good news that Denzel is now at the U.S. Embassy in Bonn, Germany, and that George can come get him. Unfortunately, George is without resources. He has just called you for advice. What can be done? 0 ~ Family Abduction--Team E Thanks to your suggestions, George and Denzel have been reunited and have returned to the U.S. George has found employment and Denzel spends his days at kindergarten or at George's parents. He has been in the U.S. for two months but cries frequently and misses his maternal grandparents. His adjustment has not gone well. George is busy driving a cab during the day and working three nights a week at a convenience store. You have just received a call from George that Denzel is missing again.

The family was vacationing and planned to stay with and attend a high school graduation ceremony of a family member who resides at an apartment building in the city. The apartment is located in a four-building apartment complex. The family arrived at the apartment at approximately 1:20 a.m. on June 8, 1996. Upon arrival, the father parked the van in the \"no parking zone\" adjacent to the apartment building. He was confronted by the security guard who instructed him to move the van once they unloaded their luggage. According to independent interviews of the mother and the father, both stated that prior arrangements were made that the father and the uncle would spend the night at the Days Inn located approximately 20 minutes away from the apartment complex. When the father departed, Kevin became very upset and would not settle down. The mother took Kevin into the parking lot to show him that the van was gone as his father had left to go to the motel. This occurred at approximately 0400 hours. At approximately 0420 hours the mother telephoned Kevin's father to tell him she could not get Kevin to quiet down and go to bed. The father offered to come back to the apartment and take Kevin to the motel. The mother told him not to come as she would try to calm Kevin. The mother reported that at approximately 0500 hours Kevin went to bed with her and the niece. At approximately 0610 hours she awoke to fred Kevin missing. She found his red shirt and underwear on the floor in the living room. She woke the aunt and niece and they do a cursory search outside to no avail. The security guard told her he observed a clothed, black male child walking behind a black male adult an hour earlier. They were headed toward the parking lot. The local police department received the missing child call at 0623 hours. There is a canal approximately 50 feet to the rear of the apartment complex. There is a dock and bridge over the canal. The police locate a witness who advises she observed a clothed black male child sitting on the dock at approximately 0500 hours. You get the call at 11:30 a.m. from the local police sergeant who is working the case. The agency is very small and they do not have a large amount of resources. They want to make sure they are tapping into every resource they can and ask for your help. What advice do you give them? What services can you provide for them in this case? Nonfamily Abduction--Team F After the father is interviewed at police headquarters he spends most of the day standing in the parking lot of the apartment building where the police have established a command post. The mother spends most of the time in the apartment with the exception of about one hour when she went for a ride with the aunt. The mother is visibly shaken. The father is stoic up until approximately 1430 hours at which time he displays signs of fatigue and stress. The aunt and uncle attend the niece's graduation along with the niece's mother. The police officers on the scene are focusing on the investigation and have not been able to spend a lot of time with the family. What services would you offer at this point in time? t, -ca Nonfamily Abduction--Team F The police department has interviewed the family and feels pretty comfortable with the parent's story. They still feel the need to investigate a little further. They are curious to know about their lives in Springfield and if there were any abuse complaints or other problems in the household. How can you help them? 0 0 0 Nonfamily Abduction--Team F A check with the Springfield, Massachusetts police and the Child Welfare Services reveals no record of criminal activity or reports of abuse and no calls of domestic violence to the home. At about 1530 hours you receive an update from the police department. The security guard, who speaks little English as he is Haitian and who said he saw a black male child at about 0600 hours near the canal with an adult male, is administered a polygraph. The test was given with the assistance of a translator, and the results are inconclusive. The police are still canvassing the area and are using search and rescue teams including divers and canine. So far no luck in the search. What next steps can you take? .o . . Nz~nfamilyAbduction~TeamF THE REST OF THE STORY Two days later, Kevin's body was found in the canal near the apartment building. Autopsy results indicated that the child's body was caused by drowning. Foul play was not suspected. The family had very little money and was not sure how they were going to get back to Massachusetts with Kevin. The local police department and victim advocates raised the money to fly the family and the child's body back home. S256196 .....

The circumstances indicate that the child was let off the school bus alone, four neighbors' yards from his home. The parents indicate that their son had no known problems at school, no clothes are missing from the house, and he always comes directly home, dropping his book bag at the door. The parents have not found the book bag anywhere between the bus stop and the house. After listening to the parents and gathering the details, what are you going to do? 0 0 0 \"\" ~Nonfamily Abduction--Team A You thought to verify the information and contact the local agency of jurisdiction. This is what you learned... The agency of jurisdiction provides you with a contact name of an investigator and requests that all inquiries on the case are referred to her. They inform you that they have searched the immediate area, but to no avail. They have confirmed the child was at school, his day was normal, and he was let off the bus by his driver at 3:12 p.m. The driver recalls seeing him in his rearview mirror walking towards his home in a light drizzle. None of the workers in the groves and nurseries around the area were able to provide any leads. They are working this case as an abduction. What do you do next? What services can you offer the law enforcement agency? What services can you directly or indirectly provide the parents, and how do you access them?

The trailer was being rented by a hired hand who was working on the property. The owner of the property suspected the man of stealing from her and went into the trailer while he was gone. She noticed the book bag and, upon looking inside, immediately recognized the child's name as that of the boy who had been missing. The owner immediately notified the police. The subject was arrested, confessed to the abduction, molestation, and murder of the child and led the police to the child's body.

A private, nonprofit organization established in 1984, NCMEC operates under a Congressional mandate and works in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in coordinating the efforts of law enforcement, social service agen- cies, elected officials, judges, prosecutors, educators, and the public and private sectors to break of violence that histori- perpetuated these need- less crimes against children. NCMEC is a national voice, mobilizer, and advocate for those too young to vote or speak up for their own rights---our children. We are working to make our children's childhoods safer ones. In the twelve short years NCMEC has been in existence, we have had an impressive impact on the fight to end child victimization. Through June 1996 NCMEC has played a role in the recovery of more than 32,000 children, worked more than 49,000 cases involving missing and exploited children, and handled approximately 1 million telephone calls through our national toll-free Hotline 1-800-THE-LOST/I-800-843-5678. We have circulated millions of of missing children, 3ximately 138,000 law enforcement officers nationwide, in Canada, and the United Kingdom and printed approximately 13 million award-winning publica- tions. And yet, there is much more to be done. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children Children \"A Strong, at Loud Voice Risk for Children\" As a society our efforts to prevent crimes against children have not kept pace with the increasing vulnerability of our young citizens. In May 1990 the U.S. Department of Justice released a study reporting that annually there are as many as 114,600 attempted abductions of chil- dren by nonfamily members. 4,600 abductions by nonfamily members reported to police. 300 abductions by nonfamily members where the children were gone for long periods of time or were murdered. 354,000 children abducted by family members. 450,700 children who ran away. 127,100 children who were thrown away. 438,200 children who were lost, injured, or otherwise missing. In 1990 NCMEC merged with the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center. John and Rev6 Walsh-- founders of the organization and parents of 6-year-old Adam who in 1981 was abducted and murdered in Florida--called upon the new organization to become \"a strong, loud voice for children.\" Today NCMEC is truly a national organi- zation with its headquarters in Arlington, Virginia; the Adam Walsh Children's Fund, based in Florida, focusing upon special projects to reach millions of chil- dren and families with positive, nonfearful child safety programs, including the state-of-the-art curriculum, KIDS AND COM- PANY; and branch offices operating in California, Florida, New York, and South Carolina providing hands-on assistance to families of missing children, advocating legislative changes to better protect children, conducting an array of prevention and aware- ness programs, and motivating citizens to become personally involved in child protection issues. To learn more about the missing and exploited child issue and ways that you can join the chorus of voices around the country speaking out to better assist and protect our children, please review our list of publications. From child safety information to detailed information on how to investigate a missing and exploited child case, NCMEC offers literature on various aspects of these serious problems found in the United States today.

III Introduction The publication of this guide is a collaborative effort of the Missing and Exploited Children Comprehensive Action Project (M / CAP) and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). NCMEC serves as the national clearinghouse and resource center on issues relating to missing and exploited children. M/CAP provides training and technical assistance to local communities in developing and maintaining effective multi- agency teams handling child victim cases with a special focus on missing and exploited children. Both projects are funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) at the U.S. Department of Justice. The guide is designed to educate and assist professionals who bear the primary responsibility of recovering and reuniting missing children with their families. This publication is utilized most effectively in conjunction with the award-winning video, \"When Your Child Comes Home.\" The videotape was produced by and much of the information set forth in this publication is adapted from the Reunification of Missing Children Project. Final Report. 1 This project was the first major study to examine the issues of reunification of children abducted either by nonfamily or family members or who ran away from home. The \"Reunification of Missing Children Project\" grew out of the work of law enforcement officers and human service professionals who have experienced substantial difficulty and frustration with the absence of \"best practice\" guidelines and training for returning a recovered child to his or her family. This guide also adds to the understanding of the dynamics of criminal victimization involved in a child abduction. Additional insights and ideas included in this publication were provided by David L. Peery, investigator in the child abduction unit of the Office of the DistriCt Attorney in Kern County, California, and Carl B. \"Bill\" Hammond, former M/CAP Project Director. A copy of the video titled \"When Your Child Comes Home\" (24 minutes) is available from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. To order it call 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678). 1C.

The vast majority of missing children eventually come home. The recovery of a missing child can be a confusing and traumatic event for the child and family. Careful planning and preparation can prevent further trauma and many potential complications. While this book offers many insights that can help when any type of child is recovered, it focuses on the at need to be taken to better assist in the reunification of children who run away or have been abducted by nonfamily or family members. Whatever the circumstances or type of case, a law enforcement officer is most often the only nonfamily person present at the time of recovery and reunification of a missing child. In a recent U.S. Department of Justice study, most reunification meetings of missing children with family members were concluded in fewer than 15 minutes with no psychological or social service support) Police officers often are required to manage missing child reunification meetings without support or training. In addition almost four-fifths of victims and their families do not receive mental health or counseling services after reunification. Some agencies or organizations may have limited knowledge or interest in the issues of missing children and their families. Abducted and runaway children may experience problems and needs common to child victims of other types of abuse or violence. It makes sense for many of the same professionals who are involved with these child victims to be knowledgeable regarding missing children as well. These professionals need to be aware of the ways that the process of recovery and initial reunification of the child with family members may negatively affect and even further traumatize the child. The goal of this publication is to provide information and guidelines to law enforcement and other professionals regarding best practice for reunifying recovered children and their families the dynamics of the criminal victimization process appropriate and careful investigation and prosecution techniques and issues appropriate post-recovery support services Planning effectively for the initial reunification can set the stage for the child's emotional recovery and reintegration into the family. 1C.

V 0 0 0 Basic Facts About Missing Children [Data in this section are excerpted from National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, Runaway, and Thrownaway Children in America (NISMART) prepared by Family Research Laboratories, University of New Hampshire, 1990, and Families of Missing Children: Psychological Consequences and Promising Interventions prepared by the Center for the Study of Trauma, University of California at San Francisco for the U.S. Department of Justice, 1992. To order a copy of these studies call the Juvenile Justice Clearinghouse at 1-800-638-8736.] Nonfamily Abduction An estimated 3,200 to 4,600 short-term, nonfamily abductions are reported to law enforcement annually. Of these, an estimated 200 to 300 are \"stereotypical kidnappings\" where a child is gone overnight, killed, or transported a distance of 50 miles or more or where the perpetrator intended to keep the child permanently. Victims include children of all ages but the 'centage of victims appear to be girls from 11 to 14 years of age and younger boys who are 6 to 9 years old. Two-thirds of short-term abductions involve a sexual assault. A majority of victims are abducted from the street. More than 85 percent of short-term nonfamily abductions involve force, and more than 75 percent involve a weapon. Most last fewer than 24 hours. The number of known short-term abductions is considered, by most researchers and practitioners, to be an underestimate due to police reporting methods and a lack of reporting on the part of victims. Based on FBI and NCMEC data, it is established that 43 to 147 homicides of children abducted by nonfamily members occurred annually between 1976 and 1987. It is estimated that annually there are 114,600 attempted abductions, all involving persons who are not known to the child's family. Most of these incidents involve attempts to lure a child into a car. Police were not contacted in jority of these cases. Family Abduction There are an estimated 354,100 family abductions annually in the United States. Forty-six (46) percent of these (an estimated 163,200 abductions) involve concealment of the child, transportation of the child out of state, or an intent by the abductor to keep the child indefinitely or to permanently alter custody. Of this more serious category of abductions, approximately half are perpetrated by men who were either noncustodial fathers or father figures. Most victims are children ranging in age from 2 to 11. Half involve unauthorized takings and half involve failures to return the child after an authorized visit or stay. Fifteen (15) percent of the abductions involve the use of force or violence. Seventy-five (75) to 85 percent involve interstate transportation of the child. Many facts are known about the problems these families faced before the abduction and the circumstances of the abduction. The various problems and circumstances noted below are not mutually exclusive for each of the families studied. Thus, some families may have only experienced one of the situations or circumstances noted below while others have experienced two or more. About half of family abductions occur before the marital relationship between the child's parents ends. Another half occur 2 or more years after a divorce or separation, usually after parents established new households, moved to other communities, developed new II m relationships, or became disenchanted with the legal system. A significant number of abductions occur in the context of relationships characterized by a history of domestic violence. Almost half of these abductors have criminal records and many have a history of violent behavior, substance abuse, or emotional disturbance. It is not uncommon for child victims of family abduction to have their names and appearances altered; experience medical or physical neglect; and be subjected to unstable schooling, homelessness, and frequent moves. They are often told lies about the abduction and left-behind parent. Sometimes they are even told that the left-behind parent is dead. Many child victims of family abduction experience substantial psychological consequences and emotional distress. Trauma symptoms may still be evident 4 or 5 years after recovery and reunification. Long-term effects, if an~ are not yet known. Runaways There are an estimated 446,700 runaways from households annually in the United States. In addition an estimated 12,800 children annually run away from juvenile facilities. Many children who run from households also run from facilities. Of these runaways, an estimated 133,500 are without a secure and familiar place to stay during their episode. More than a third, of the estimated 446,700 runaways, run away more than once during the year. Runaways are mostly teenagers. They tend to come disproportionately from households with a stepparent. One (1) in 10 travel a distance of more than 100 miles while gone. Of the runaways from juvenile facilities, almost half leave the state. The families of chronic runaway youth are characterized by long-term, unresolved problems with a high incidence of physical and emotional abuse. Other problems are often present including alcohol and drug abuse and difficulties with school staff, friends, and police. Long-term runaways and those without a secure place to stay are at high risk for exploitation and violence by those who wish to take advantage of them. Thrownaways Annually in the United States there are an estimated 127,100 children who are directly told to leave the household, who had been away from home and were not allowed back by a caretaker, whose caretaker made no effort to recover the child once he or she ran away, or who had been abandoned or deserted. An estimated 59,200 thrownaway children are without a secure and familiar place to stay while away from home. Most thrownaways are older teenagers. Abandoned children tend to be young; half are younger than 4 years of age. Thrownaways are concentrated in low income families and families without both natural parents. Compared to runaways, thrownaways experience more violence and conflict within their families and are less likely to return home. Lost, Injured, or Otherwise Missing Annually in the United States there are an estimated 438,200 children who are lost, injured, or otherwise missing. This category arises because many times when a child is reported missing there is not enough evidence to determine whether he or she is the victim of foul play or just inadvertently or unavoidably detained and may only be \"categorized\" after determining what has happened to the child. For instance a child who is found after wandering away from his or her parents in a shopping mall or wooded area would be considered a missing child. In cases where a child is injured and cannot immediately obtain help, that child is considered missing until parents and/or authorities can be notified of the child's whereabouts. In cases where a child makes an unscheduled stop at a video arcade or friend's house, once found the child is considered to have been missing under otherwise unknown circumstances. From this category 139,100 cases are serious enough that the police are called. Of these 438,200 cases almost half involve children younger than 4 year.s of age, most episodes last fewer than 24 hours, one fifth of the children experience physical harm, and 14 percent of the children are abused or assaulted during the episode. 2 A Team Approach to Reunification A missing child case and the imminent recovery of a missing child should generate planning and response by a team composed of multiple community agencies. The primary organizations or professionals needed in the recovery and reunification of missing children include law enforcement (involving the FBI in some cases), family and dependency court personnel, child protective or social service, mental health professionals, and victim-witness advocates. This chapter focuses on tips for establishing such a team and general issues that apply to most recovered children. For a discussion of specific issues regarding particular case types see \"Special Issues of Nonfamily and Family Abductions and Runaway Children\" beginning on page 17. Establishing a Recovery and Reunification Team [This section was written with the input of a number of individuals including Detective David L. Barnard of the King County Police Department in Seattle, Washington; Kita Curry, Ph.D., of the Didi Hirsch Community Mental Health Center in Culver City, California; Jill Searle of Find the Children in Los Angeles, California; Barry Drew of the Haven Poe Center and Detective James Caimano of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office in Tampa, Florida. All of these communities have active reunification teams with significant experience and training.] The Role of Teams Creating teams to address system problems is not a new concept. Teams have been developed in many communities to address problems of coordination in cases of child abuse and neglect and child fatalities; however, teams focusing on missing children are far fewer. Such teams frequently bring together representatives from independent public agencies and private organizations that may have conflicting interests to work in a coordinated and cooperative effort. The process is not easy and does not always produce quick results. The long-term impact of improving case handling, however, is well worth the effort and outweighs the difficulties. Developing a multi-agency reunification team may present special challenges due to limited availability of training and educational materials focusing on missing children and their families. Agencies may be unclear about the needs of these children as well as how to respond to them. Effective communication and cooperation with law enforcement on missing child cases does not exist in many communities. For jurisdictions that already have an effective multidisciplinary team it may be possible to develop a reunification task force within the framework of the existing team. For example the Los Angeles Interagency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect (ICAN) worked with the local nonprofit organization Find the Children to create a \"Child Abduction Task Force\" for handling missing child cases and planning for their reunification. The Child Abduction Task Force received training and developed written protocols on reunification. A copy of their protocols is included beginning on page 37. Even when a community has an existing multidisciplinary team the process of forming a reunification task force may not be an easy one. Such communities may benefit from the information contained in this section and from a review of the ICAN materials. In brief, an effective reunification team should include a specially trained, on-call law enforcement officer a specially trained, on-call mental health professional 3 B II participation of child welfare professionals participation of victim-witness advocates In certain cases assistance from other agencies will be needed such as hospitals and guardian ad litem programs. All professionals on the team should be specially trained in the missing child issue and recovery/reunification of these children. The process of developing a team involves a series of activities including reviewing current policies and practices, identifying problems and barriers, creating a plan, and implementing the plan. Ongoing evaluation of the team approach is an important but sometimes overlooked component. A multi-agency, county-level team for recovery and reunification can accomplish many purposes simultaneously. A team approach enables agencies and professionals to plan ahead for the recovery and reunification of the child and ensures that the involved agencies are acting in a coordinated fashion. In doing so the team will be able to take a pro-active approach, when time allows, to initiate a reunification response at the onset of the case when anticipated needs of the child and family can be determined prevent unnecessary and additional trauma to the child and family upon recovery and reunification improve criminal investigation and prosecution of child abduction cases provide accurate information regarding post-recovery placement issues ensure that recovered children and their families receive mental health services and other victim-related assistance identify circumstances surrounding abductions and recoveries that could be prevented or more effectively addressed in the future improve communication among agencies and provide more timely notification of agencies when a child is recovered Teams are generally created through the force of individual efforts and the voluntary cooperation of agencies involved with missing children. A mediation style approach is often the most effective in reaching out to these agencies. Some agencies have worked together in the past; for others it may be the first time that they have worked in collaboration with one another. Each jurisdiction adapts its approach to the unique characteristics and resources that exist in the community. The local political climate and relationships among the heads of core agencies often impact the approach taken in forming the team. Starting Up To start a reunification team in a county, all that is needed is one individual with a desire and willingness to commit the time and energy to get it started. That person may come from a variety of agencies, but he or she should be part of one of the core agencies. The core agencies needed for a reunification team are law enforcement (local and FBI), ment-' health, victim advocates and guardians ad prosecution, child protective services, and schools. Other agencies and organizations that may be involved vary according to jurisdiction and available resources but may include family court services, children's advocacy centers, missing children nonprofit organizations, and outside experts. An organizational meeting should be held. A letter or fact sheet explaining the purpose of the proposed team and organizational meeting should be prepared. Invitations should be extended by telephone or letter to the appropriate contacts in each agency or organization..The individual coordinating the first meeting may need to make appointments with agency heads or representatives to describe the project and ask them to designate the most appropriate person(s) to the team. Once core agencies have been contacted, a time and place for the meeting should be set. The meeting should be held even if everyone does not attend. At the meeting present basic information about recovery and reunification of missing children. It may be necessary to also present basic information about issues regarding abducted and runaway children. Additional written information and publications on these issues may be obtained by contacting the resources noted in the \"Appendices\" beginning on page 29. present information about multi-agency, multi-disciplinary recovery and reunification teams. The benefits to participating agencies should be stressed. allow time for each person attending an opportunity to express concerns or raise special issues. discuss and agree on some initial operating procedures. These procedures may simply include designating a time, place, and process for designing a strategy to implement the team. designate a person or organization to coordinate the meetings and notify all team members of the time and place of future meetings. Attendance will be higher if a regular time and place is chosen for meetings, allowing members to incorporate meetings into their schedules. Implementing the Team Building a team is a process. Each team will need to set its own timetable for development. Final goals and objectives of the team will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but every team will need to accomplish the following tasks in order to function effectively review current policies and practices. Identify problems, obstacles to coordination, and service gaps. Assess existing resources and identify potential ones. identify mission, goals, and objectives of the reunification team. Each team will need to define the types of cases in which they will become involved, how cases will be referred to the team, and how cases will be handled by the team. develop a strategy and written plan for accomplishing goals and objectives. develop policies and procedures for handling issues of confidentiality of discussions and information shared at meetings. develop procedures for documenting and evaluating reunification team activities. Communities that conduct regular evaluations of the effectiveness of their services are in the best position to respond quickly when challenged. identify and obtain training on issues related to recovery and reunification of missing children for team members and their agencies. Many teams have found it helpful to bring in a trained and neutral facilitator to assist in the team-building and strategic planning process. An outside person can urge participants to examine and resolve difficult issues without being perceived as having a vested interest in the outcome. Someone who is not involved in the day-to-day response to missing children can often see problems that are not readily apparent to participants. Qualified consultants can be found in most communities, particularly at local universities, in civic organizations, and in professional associations. Look for individuals with experience in working with groups, organizational development, and team- building. Many private corporations and businesses utilize similar processes in their workplace and will donate the services of professional facilitators for community efforts. There are individuals in other teams around the country who have experience in the issues of missing children and in recovery and reunification specifically. Most of these individuals are willing to share their experience with other professionals seeking to address the same issues. Tips From Successful Teams Most teams have earned their successes the hard way -- by trial and error and by making many mistakes. Learning to work together can be hard work. Working to address an issue that has not previously been attempted can add to the difficulty of the task. Addressing it successfully can also provide a great deal of satisfaction, both personally and professionally. Teams from around the country have identified the following recommendations for a successful multi-agency reunification effort one agency coordinates and activates the team. It may be law enforcement or it may be a nonprofit. Law enforcement will often be the first agency to be aware of an imminent or recent recovery. At the very least, they will need to notify the coordinating agency as soon as possible. The coordinating agency need not be the same one under all circumstances, but the determining criteria is clearly stated. while one agency coordinates the team process, team \"ownership\" is a shared responsibility. Each agency's unique perspective and role is recognized and valued by team members. roles and responsibilities of individual team members and their agencies are spelled out in written policies and procedures and cover the varying circumstances that may face the team. The agency with primary responsibility for particular aspects of recovery and reunification is clearly identified, as well as those involved on-site or immediately following recovery. Not all agencies are needed on-site for recovery and the reunification event or immediately following. Some agencies will be drawn into active case participation within hours, others within days and weeks. Some flexibility of roles is necessary since recoveries and reunifications of missing children may involve unknown and unpredictable factors. procedures for.notifying team members and activating services are clearly stated. team members are available when notified of a recovery or are able to ensure their role is covered by another agency representative if the primary team member is unavailable at the time he or she is needed. provisions exist to convene the team when unusually demanding cases or an emergency situation arises. team members are trained in issues relating to abducted and runaway children including abduction trauma, post-recovery issues, and best practices for recovery and reunification. Training is provided for specific disciplines when appropriate (e.g., investigative training for law enforcement, training on therapeutic approaches for mental health). Cross-training on basic issues is provided to all team members. New team members are brought up to speed as quickly as possible. the reunification team meets regularly. In larger jurisdictions teams hold monthly meetings to discuss recent recovery cases and those cases in which a recovery is expected in the near future. These meetings enable the team to accomplish several important purposes: (1) provides a forum for team members to share information on cases and plan for upcoming recoveries and reunifications; (2) allows team members to know how cases on which they have worked have been resolved and how their participation has benefited the process; (3) enables team members to identify children and families with new or continuing problems; and (4) provides a forum for ongoing evaluation of efforts and allows the team to refine protocols and procedures based upon experience. Teams involved in recovery and reunification have emphasized the importance of planning whenever possible. By taking a pro-active approach, reunification teams are able to identify appropriate cases for intervention at the earliest opportunity and make preliminary assessments regarding what will be needed for the on-site response. A reunification team can assume that there will be significant gaps in their knowledge of the dynamics of the abduction and issues regarding reunification that the child or parents may have. Once the child is recovered it is important to fill in those gaps as soon as possible to enable an effective reunification and follow up. 6 In many cases the circumstances surrounding a recovery and reunification will not allow planning ahead. In cases where only a crisis response is possible, a \"triage\" process will need to be undertaken by the team to assess a variety of issues and come Up with an impromptu plan that will hopefully address the immediate needs of the victim and family. While this improvisation is not the ideal, this coordination of effort still may have an enormous impact upon the healing process of abduction victims and families. Planning for Recovery and Reunification Whether a child voluntarily left home or was abducted, many such child victims and their left-behind family members experience substantial psychological consequences and emotional distress. Team members need to understand that the level of distress has been compared to that experienced by victims of other severe trauma such as combat veterans; children who have been catastrophically burned; or victims of rape, assault, and other violent crimes) The severity of trauma to the child and family is determined by the type of case, how long the child has been gone, what happened to the child while he or she was gone, and the coping styles of the child victim and family. The dynamics of an abduction cover a broad range of conditions and events. Understanding the details of the abduction or runaway experience of the child is necessary for effective investigation and reunification. The following areas should be considered by professionals involved in recovering and reuniting a child. These areas may apply to family abduction, nonfamily abduction, and runaway victims in varying degrees. physical and emotional condition of the recovered child. circumstances of the initial abduction or runaway episode and any level of violence used or experienced. length of time the child was away from his or her home. . circumstances of and events occurring both prior to and during the missing period. physical or sexual violence to the child. specific living conditions during the abduction including frequent moves, \"fugitive\" lifestyle, attention to the child's nutritional and medical needs, and consistent schooling. name changes for either the child or abducting parent. deliberate alteration of the child's physical appearance. child's beliefs about the motives for the abduction or runaway episode. child's relationship with the abductor and/or any other persons encountered during the missing period. child's relationship with each parent and other significant family members before the abduction. degree of social isolation of the child or infliction of emotional abuse. separation from nonabducted/left- behind siblings. child's beliefs about authorities. circumstances of recovery and impact on the child. child's expectations or beliefs regarding the outcome of the abduction. Did the child believe he or she would never be rescued? Did the child believe that he or she would die? child's expectations about reunification and beliefs about the recovering parent(s). If the abductor was a family member, was the child told that the other parent was dead or evil? family members' expectations about reunification. changes in the left-behind family's configuration/circumstances during the time the child was away (e.g., birth of another sibling, death of a family member, remarriage). 1C. Hatcher, C. Barton, and L. Brooks. Families of Missing Children: Psychological Consequences and Promising Interventions. Final Report. Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice, 1992, p. 1. 7 Professionals involved in this reunification process must remember that the world of a family of an abducted or runaway child has been turned upside down. They may have many questions when their child is recovered. They may be uncertain of what to expect from their recovered child and concerned about whether they will be able to meet the child's needs. They may be uncomfortable or unsure of asking the child about the circumstances of the abduction or runaway episode. By the time their missing child has been recovered, the family will have already experienced overwhelming stress and trauma. Child victims of family abduction and their left-behind parent(s) probably have experienced a highly conflicted and painful separation or divorce. As a result, left-behind family members may have difficulty mobilizing resources available to them and their recovered child. Left-behind family members may not even be aware of the resources that exist in their community. Family behavior and coping styles prior to the abduction will often predict the ability of the family to cope with the abduction itself and the recovery and reunification of the child. Thus it is the responsibility of the professionals involved with the reunification to assess the needs of the family and make every effort to help the family meet all of those needs in a sensitive, effective, efficient, and economical way. Law Enforcement as Lead Responder Just as law enforcement assumes the primary responsibility for investigating and searching Reunification Team Participants i Law Enforcement Agencies Mental Health Organizations Child Protective or Social Services Family or Dependency Courts Victim-Witness Agencies for the missing child, it is typically the law enforcement officer who recovers the child and is in charge of the actual reunification of the child with family members. Family members and other agency personnel will need direction from the police. The officer and his or her agency must plan for and manage the recovery and initial reunification meeting of the child with the family. Only careful planning ahead of time will ensure that recovery and reunification benefits the child rather than causing additional and unnecessary trauma. The general responsibilities of law enforcement involve providing for the immediate physical needs of the child arranging for the physical and psychological evaluation of the recovered child in preparation for reunification conducting an interview with the child as soon as possible to obtain information about the circumstances of the abduction or runaway episode, other individuals involved, and possible criminal acts securing physical evidence necessary for the investigation as soon as possible setting the parameters of case information to be prepared and provided to the public notifying and briefing other agency professionals on the status of the recovered child and family notifying and briefing the child's family Law enforcement officers involved in the recovery and reunification of a missing child should be prepared to provide initial comfort and reassurance to the child. The officer may have to transport the recovered child to a medical facility for examination. The officer will probably need to be present at the reunification of the recovered child and parents. If taking the child's clothing is necessary for evidence collection, then the officer should arrange for the child to receive clean and comfortable garments to wear. 8 responsibilities are complex and personally demanding. The child may have experienced psychological, physical, or sexual abuse during the period while missing. The officer must often make immediate decisions about the child's physical and emotional health. Advice and assistance from other involved professionals are necessary for appropriate decision-making. The officer may experience intense pressure from parents/caretakers and the media to provide immediate access to the child. In some circumstances this may be harmful to the child. The officer should not hesitate to slow down events while a careful evaluation is performed rather than allow a potentially disastrous situation to occur. Preparing for Recovery/Reunification Law enforcement officers need to be fully prepared to manage the on-site recovery. If officers are not confident that they are returning a recovered child to an acceptable family environment, they should prepare for alternative or temporary care until such issues can be resolved. Officers should ensure that community mental health and social support agencies are knowledgeable and available to assist in the reunification of recovered children with their families. Many children will need time to make a transition to their new situation. For instance in family abduction cases children who have been conditioned to believe that left-behind family members pose a danger to them may be fearful of returning to those family members. The officer and other reunification team members need to take the time necessary to make accurate assessments and careful decisions about the well-being of the child. The officer should always be prepared for alternative placement of the child and have available resources standing by. If recovering a child in another jurisdiction, officers should know, prior to traveling, what the requirements are in that jurisdiction for } picking up the child including specific documentation. Without the necessary documentation, the reunification process may be delayed adding to the family's trauma. For instance a photograph of the child, a copy of the birth certificate, and certified copies of court orders may be required. Officers also should be prepared to attend to any special physical needs of the child such as medications, clothing, or language interpretation. Privacy should be a priority for the reunification meeting of the child and family. If the child is taken to a hospital for an examination or for medical treatment, immediate family members may be taken there as well. In cases of family abduction it is important for the reunification to take place in a neutral and private setting. Professionals want to avoid having what is usually a difficult and upsetting event played out in front of others. Interviewing the Recovered Child The child is usually the best source of information about the circumstances surrounding the abduction, the conditions in which he or she lived, and what he or she was told by the abductor. The person conducting the interview must establish a rapport with the child in order to obtain the most complete and accurate information without causing the child additional distress. A specialist with training in child interviewing and knowledge of the developmental capabilities of children should conduct the interview regardless of the division to which the investigation is assigned. The officer may want to enlist the assistance of another trained professional such as a mental health counselor who has experience in interviewing child victims. The officer should find a comfortable and nonthreatening setting in which to conduct the interview. If the community has a children's advocacy center or some other special facility or room for interviewing child victims, the officer should try to arrange to use the facility to interview the recovered child. Movement of the child should be kept to a minimum to avoid additional confusion and trauma to the child. In family abduction cases the interviewer should avoid influencing the child in favor of one parent. 9 The interviewer needs to understand the child's perceptions of the abduction, the abductor, left-behind family members, and the actual recovery. It is important to reassure the recovered child that his or her parent(s) have been searching for him or her. If more than one child was abducted, each child should be interviewed separately. Remember, siblings may react differently to the reunification. Children in the same family often do not react to family events in the same way. For example one child may remember the searching parent while the other may not. The officer may not have another opportunity to interview the child; therefore, he or she should develop questions before meeting with the recovered child to assure that critical information is obtained. Later the child may be reluctant to discuss the abduction due to implicit or expressed concerns of family members or a desire to put the event behind him or her. It is best to leave a door open for future interviews with the child. In particularly traumatic abductions children may disclose information over time as they feel more comfortable with the interviewer. In cases where the name and role of the child or the abductor has been changed during the abduction, special care should be taken in interviewing the child. The child may have difficulty understanding his or her relationship with the abductor depending on which name the child uses to refer to him- or herself or the abductor. The child may seem confused or unable to discuss the matter. The child may see the abductor with the assumed name as 2 different persons. A child's response to a question may depend upon whether the questions asked use the assumed name(s) or legal name(s). It is best to use the name with which the child is most comfortable. The officer should not force the child to use his or her original name if the child shows discomfort or uncertainty about using it. Returning to the use of the original name may require long-term therapy and is the responsibility of the mental health provider. The interview and any other contact with the child should be prefaced by a brief explanation of what is going to happen. During the interview children should be given detailed information, if possible, regarding any travel arrangements and their new living situation. This is particularly important for children who have been missing for a long period of time and when there have been major changes in the family or living situation while they were gone. As with any interview of a child victim, the officer needs to remember that his or her responsibility is to gather the facts and information surrounding the abduction and victimization. The investigator needs to determine the who, what, when, where, and how. While the officer is not a therapist, he or she must remain aware that an improperly conducted interview or one that focuses on blame can cause severe emotional trauma to the recovered child. Officers should be very careful with \"why\" questions. If asked inappropriately they can cause unnecessary feelings of guilt and emotional distress in the child. The gathering of information necessary to bring the perpetrator to justice is important; however, pressing for such information should stop short of further traumatizing the child. The well-being of the child must remain the primary objective of all agencies involved in the reunification process. Role of Mental Health Involving a mental health professional from the onset will help the child and family. A child who is getting the help he or she needs is more likely to be cooperative and effective in an ongoing investigation and court process. The mental health professional should be familiar with what is needed by both the child and criminal justice agencies. Mental health professionals on the reunification team need to evaluate the recovered child and family to assess the emotional stress caused by the abduction and recovery as well as to plan for stabilizing the family and providing treatment for the child. It is often difficult for mental health experts to determine to what extent emotional stress was caused by events 10 in the family prior to the abduction or runaway episode. The mental health professional working with the child victim and family also will need to maintain a level of knowledge about investigative and legal procedures potentially affecting the recovered child and the child's family. Information about the psychological impact of abduction on children and families is currently not readily available. Professionals will have to make special efforts to educate themselves about the issues relating to this particular type of victimization. Some resources and suggested reading materials on this topic are listed in \"Training and Information Resources\" found on page 36. Role of Child Protective or Social Services The involvement by social service or child protective service professionals in the recovery of a missing child is necessary when the family is not immediately available to reunite with the child and take the child home or when there is a question of the ability of the recovering family to care for the child. Both situations occur more commonly in family abduction, runaway, or thrownaway cases. When a child is recovered in a location that is distant from the family's home, travel time and financial resources may limit the ability of the family to get to the recovery location promptly. Allegations of neglect, physical abuse, or sexual abuse may have been made against the recovering family or parent in family abduction and runaway cases. In family abduction cases there may be counter allegations by the other parent. All such allegations need to be investigated promptly; thoroughly, and objectively. If the left-behind parent lives outside the jurisdiction in which the child is recovered and plans to take the child back to his or her place of residence, social service professionals in both locations need to work together to determine how the case will be managed. Role of Family or Dependency Court Many times dependency and family court profession- als need to become involved in the recovery and reunification of a missing child. This occurs most commonly in relation to issues of child custody and visitation in family abduction, issues of a family's ability to care for a runaway or thrownaway child upon recovery, and/or allegations of abuse in these cases. In order to make effective assessments and decisions regarding these child victims, courts need access to the most complete and accurate information about the child, the family, and the circumstances of the missing episode. This information may only be available through a variety of agencies. The best way to ensure the availability of good information about child victims is through an effective multi-agency information sharing and case management process employed in multidisciplinary teams (MDTs). For information on such MDTs call the Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information at 1-800-FYI-3366 or in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area at 703-385-7565. Role of Victim-Witness Agencies Profession- als in victim-witness agencies and programs are needed to assist the recovered child and family in providing information about and support for subsequent criminal court proceedings and in obtaining compensation for treatment and services for physical and mental injuries. In order to qualify for compensation and services, the recovered child must have been the victim of a crime while missing. Almost every child victim of a nonfamily abduction will qualify, but the same is not true for every runaway or child who is abducted by a family member. In many states the crime victim in a family abduction case is defined as the left-behind parent. The abducted child is not viewed as a crime victim unless physical or sexual abuse by the abducting parent can be proved and a criminal prosecution occurs. Most crime victim compensation programs do not include psychological abuse which is the most common type of maltreatment associated with family abduction. Compensation for crime victims may also be limited by additional requirements, funding restrictions, or resources in individual states. Nonetheless this potential avenue of assistance should be thoroughly explored. 11 The Reunification Meeting F ~ To some extent the circumstances and timing of a child recovery will determine the ability of agency personnel to plan for the actual reunification meeting between the recovered child and family members. Whenever possible agency personnel involved in the recovery of a missing child should consider the following issues and steps. ~'~Z'~'*~ \"\u00b0~''~':, 'v ............ -. ' \" :': - \" v. ~o: ,Guidelines forthe Reunification Meeting,, \" :.; Physical/Emotional Needs of Child Come First Alert Family Members as Quickly as Possible Reunion Should Take Place in a Neutral/Private Location --, Lead Agency Should Follow Pre-Existing Procedures and Plans to \"-~ Handle All Aspects of the Recovery from Media Involvement to Activating Other Team Members Physical and emotional needs of the child come first. The child may need to be comforted and assured of his or her safety. Alert family members as quickly as possible. Prior to reunification, parents need to be given information about the recovery and the physical and emotional condition of the child. They should be encouraged to allow the necessary medical and psychological evaluation and treatment to take place. In nonfamily abduction cases the time spent waiting while medical examinations and procedures are being done may be a good time to explain to the family the different emotional states the child may experience and how to deal with them. (For a summary of these stages see \"Child Abduction: Stages of Emotional Reaction in Nonfamily Abduction Cases\" on page 30.) Parents should be encouraged to focus on making their child feel comfortable and safe, while leaving law enforcement to determine what happened to the child when he or she was gone. The initial impulse of parents may be to protect their child and to take him or her home immediately. Team members may have to remind the parent that the child may be the best source of critically-needed information about the event. Parents should be reminded that professionals need time to talk with the- child and gather evidence regarding the perpetrator and the circumstances of the abduction. Parents should be assured that investigators also have the best interests of the recovered child as their main focus, and the investigator's special training and/or experience should be emphasized. Recovery and reunification should take place in a neutral and private location. Chaos and confusion should be kept to a minimum. The location will determine, to some extent, the ability of professionals to control events and media access. Arranging a neutral and private place will provide everyone involved some \"breathing room.\" It will also give Reunification Team members an opportunity to explain rights and options to the family and offer initial assistance and resources. The recovered child and his or her family need time to digest all of the information and intense emotions barraging them in a brief span of time. Law enforcement agencies should have procedures and plans to handle the media interest that may surround the recovery of an abducted child. Even though media attention may be intense, the needs of the recovered child and family come first. Professionals 13 II II involved with the family may need to help ensure that these needs are protected by allowing the family to enter the reunification site through a private or protected entrance. Families need privacy at this time. They do not need to see the reunification with their child on the evening news. Individuals Caring for other children at home should be provided with instructions regarding media calls and requests. Similar steps should be taken to protect any siblings who may still be in school or at other locations at the time of recovery. If there are other children at home, plans need to be made for their care in the home while other family members go to the reunification meeting. Information about the progress of the reunification and the anticipated return of the recovered child should be provided to the temporary caregiver to pass on to other family members. The law enforcement officer or mental health professional team member should instruct the family to bring several familiar items to the reunification meeting such as the child's favorite toy and photographs of family members, family events, or pets to which the child was particularly attached. These items may assist the child with recovering memories of the family and his or her past life and can serve as a conversational icebreaker during the initial meeting. For older children, bringing newspaper articles or missing child posters may provide needed confirmation to the child of efforts made to recover him or her. Families may need assistance with transporta- tion and other arrangements for their return home due to intense media attention or financial difficulties. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children works with private corporations to provide transportation and lodging to parents who cannot afford to travel to pick up a child who has been recovered and is in protective custody. Call NCMEC at 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) to learn more about this program including limitations and restrictions. In developmentally appropriate language the recovered child should be informed about each step in the recovery and reunification process, as well as his or her participation in the investigative process. This is particularly important when the child is placed into temporary custody. Foster parents with whom the child is placed should also be provided with information about the child's situation, including what to expect from the child and instructions for helping the child. The family should be given some idea of the contact they will have with investigators in the following days. This is not the time for the family to see many different faces, so the primary investigator should remain the lead contact with the family. Professionals involved in the recovery and reunification of a missing child should make parents aware of potential responses from their child and prepare them to deal with these possibilities without becoming angry or rejecting the child. In some cases the child may appear apathetic or emotionally blunted, fearful, or even ambivalent or hostile about the reunification. Parents should be encouraged to take the lead in greeting the child. They need to be told about what to expect on their child's first night home. Rather than talking about the abduction event, the recovered child probably will be focused on being in his or her room and becoming reacquainted with siblings. Parents may be relieved to have their child home but anxious about the ability of the child to adjust in both the short- and long-term. Parents need to understand that things may not return to the way they were before the abduction occurred. Professionals should not assume that a child whose behavior appears controlled or nonchalant is untroubled by the events taking place. Detachment may be the recovered child's 14 of coping with a terrifying and painful situation. the child should be the first priority of the Reunification Team. Family abduction or runaway cases involving allegations of physical or sexual abuse need to be given priority and investigated in a timely manner to avoid unnecessary trauma. The child and both parents need to be interviewed. If a child communicates allegations of abuse and/or evidence of abuse is present, established protocols for evaluation and investigation need to be followed. Protecting Mental health professionals will need to make arrangements to follow up with the family as soon as possible, but at the very least no later than 48 hours after the reunification. Most families will need ongoing support to cope with the effects of the abduction of their child and its aftermath. These effects may not be apparent immediately but may emerge over time. 15 Special Issues of Nonfamily and Family Abductions and Runaway Children While there are many generalizations that can be made about missing children cases, this chapter discusses specific issues related to runaways and nonfamily and family abductions. Special Issues of Nonfamily Abduction Nonfamily persons usually abduct children for one or more of the following purposes sexual assault to raise the child as his or her own for ransom homicide Child victims of nonfamily abductions are the most likely to have experienced sexual and physical assaults. This type of abduction has the highest risk for homicide. Recovered children who were abducted by a nonfamily member often have initial concerns about their safety and being reabducted. Often they do not believe that they are really safe. Upon recovery these child victims may appear to be coping very well. It is common for children who have experienced trauma to be talkative initially and have excellent recall of details. This is a good time for the investigating officer to obtain critical and timely information from the child regarding the abduction and subsequent events. Professionals and parents need to be aware that this initial period of euphoria and the child's immediate and initial disclosure of information about their abduction may quickly be replaced by a feeling of numbness. Child victims may appear to be detached and distant from family and friends, apathetic in day-to-day activities, and uninterested in things and activities they previously enjoyed. They may exhibit feelings of denial or avoidance of the abduction event. Teenage victims may show blunted emotions, apathy, and denial of any intrusive thoughts or negative feelings about the abduction event. They may insist that their normal life and activities will not be affected by the abduction. Families may misinterpret the numbness reaction of the recovered child as emotional callousness or adjustment. This numbness is the child's way of coping with overwhelming emotions regarding the abduction and recovery. It is important to remember that the lack of emotion is symptomatic and indicative of ongoing trauma. The period of emotional numbness may last from a few weeks to many months. There may also be a great deal of pressure from the public and the media to know details of the abduction and to have access to the child victim. Because the recovered child appears to be coping or may even appear euphoric, it may seem harmless to expose the child to media interviews. For most child victims, the reality of what they have experienced will hit them within hours or days of recovery. When that happens, they may find it difficult to cope with the public exposure of their victimization. This exposure may lead them to feel that they have been re-victimized or exploited even further. Professionals involved in the recovery of an abducted child should cofmsel parents to protect their children from well-intentioned, but potentially exploitive well-wishers and media representatives. Law enforcement investigators should counsel the victim and family members about the limits of case information that can be provided to the media. Family members should be cautioned about the potential harm to their child from media exposure following recovery. Parents need to be reassured that they have the right to provide their child with the privacy he or she needs. This may be difficult to do, particularly when the media may have played a role in the recovery of the child. 17 II Law enforcement officers should be prepared to handle the intense media interest that may accompany the recovery of an abducted child. The establishment of a command post and media briefings by a trained public information officer will alleviate some of the chaos and provide needed privacy for the recovered child and the family. Media and well-wishers should be encouraged to allow the family time and privacy. Rather than allowing the child to be overwhelmed by large numbers of family members and friends, the first post-recovery meeting should include only immediate family members. In many cases, children and adolescent victims of abduction assume that they will not be missed and that no one is looking for them. Upon recovery, they are surprised to realize that major efforts were undertaken to find them. Many abducted children fear or believe that they will never see their families again or that they will be killed. The interpersonal relationship developed between the child victim and the abductor during the event has been shown to be an important factor in establishing psychological control during the abduction. The process by which this relationship develops may be critical to understanding the child's emotional responses following recovery. The recovered child may seem ambivalent about the abductor. Because of the vulnerability of the child, the desire to see the abductor punished may conflict with fears of reprisal. The child may fear that the abductor or friends of the abductor will return. The child is primarily dependent upon adults for assurances, but may feel that adults \"failed\" to protect him or her from the first incident. 1 1C. Hatcher. A Conceptual Framework for Victimology: The Adult and Hostage Experience. Paper presented at the American Psychological Convention, Los Angeles, California, 1981. Guidelines for Handling the Reunion of a Nonfamily Abducted Child The agency responsible for facilitating the reunion should Arrange for a comprehensive physical examination of the victim, determine any immediate physical or emotional needs of the child, and ensure that those needs are met. ,, Conduct a careful interview of the child, document the results of the interview, and involve all appropriate agencies. Notify the child's pareni~s of the recovery and request that they bring only immediate family members to a designated private location for the reunion. Brief the parents on their child's condition and ask them to refrain from making a public announcement about the child's recovery. In,~truct the parents to bring along a change of clothing for the child and any familiar or favorite items of the child's that were left behind when the child was abducted.

Within hours the abductor was apprehended, and Carly was recovered alive. She had been sexually assaulted repeatedly during her captivity. Carly was returned to her home town, taken to a hospital for examination, and questioned by police officers. A few hours later police officers drove her home where her family and a huge crowd of reporters, neighbors, and well-wishers were gathered in the street. The reunification with her parents and siblings took place in the driveway amid the crowd and with cameras recording every expression and word. Fewer than 48 hours later Carly was interviewed on camera for a nationally broadcast television program. At that point she had not received any mental health counseling. ,, -i ZThe names have been changed in all reunion scenarios featured in this publication to protect the privacy of the victims and families involved. 19 Special Issues of Family Abduction Cases of family abduction may present special difficulties for law enforcement officers charged with enforcing a custody order and picking up a child. Many law enforcement officers are hesitant to pick up a childor accompany a parent to recover a child without an order from a court of their state or statutory authority. Determining the validity of the custody order can be difficult, and the potential for civil liability exists if the order is later determined to be invalid. Some states direct law enforcement officers by law to return a child to the lawful custodian when the abductor is arrested. In most states, law enforcement officers will turn the child over to the recovering parent as long as they are not prohibited by law from doing so. This is true whether or not criminal charges are pending against the abductor. The issues of enforcement of child custody orders and executing arrest warrants for the abducting family member are separate issues. It is important for law enforcement officers to be knowledgeable about the legal issues with regard to enforcing child custody orders. These issues are presented in greater depth in Missing and Abducted Children: A Law Enforcement Guide to Case Investigation and Program Management and Family Abduction, both published by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. To order a fre e copy of these books call 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678). When recovering a child victim of family abduction it is important for agencies to consider the behavior of the abducting parent prior to the abduction and the experiences of the child during the abduction. Professionals should discover as quickly as possible what the child believes or has been told about the recovering parent. If it is determined that the child believes the parent is dead or dangerous, a mental health professional should be involved immediately to assist with interviewing the child and assessing the condition of the child in preparation for reunification. The child may have been told that the left- behind parent did not love or want him or her, was hurting the child, or died. The child may have been brainwashed to believe that the searching parent will harm him or her. The child may have been taught to fear being \"apprehended\" by the police. If the child is very young or missing for a long period of time, he or she may not remember the left- behind parent or even his or her own real name. Despite the circumstances of the abduction, child victims often develop a dependency upon the abducting parent. The child may feel protective toward the abductor and want to take care of or shield the abducting parent. For a child who has been missing a long time or who believes the recovering parent is dead or is a frightening person, recovery and reunification with that parent can be a terrifying experience. The child may even perceive the recovery and reunification as another abduction. Allegations and counter-allegations of neglect, physical abuse, or sexual abuse by one or both parents are not uncommon at the time of recovery of the child. When allegations of abuse have been made or there is a documented history of abuse, it is important to involve child protective services and, if appropriate, the courts. A careful evaluation should be done prior to the reunification of the child with the left-behind parent. It is not uncommon for a recovered child to be placed in temporary custodial care until maltreatment issues have been resolved. Family abduction cases frequently involve couples with a documented history of spouse abuse. The abductor may take the child to punish or intimidate the other parent or to try and force a reconciliation. Cases where the abusive partner is also the abductor require special caution in recovery of the child. It is important to know if the abductor has made threats about harming or killing the child. In some situations it may be appropriate for courts to review placement of the children. Some parents will abduct their children in the course of fleeing spousal abuse. Domestic violence laws and laws regarding child custody and family abduction have developed independently of each Other over time. These laws often present complex problems and ethical dilemmas for those charged with 20 protecting children, protecting battered women, and enforcing child custody orders and abduction laws. In some states fleeing domestic violence is a legitimate defense in family abduction cases. It is important for the officer to know the applicable laws in his or her state. There are liability issues that should also be considered carefully when allowing a searching parent to recover the child and confront the abducting parent alone. Where there are allegations of abuse of the child or a parent, the searching parent should not be allowed to recover the child without the assistance and involvement of agency personnel. Steps should be taken to ensure the safety of both the abused parent and the child in potentially dangerous situations. The abducting parent should not be interviewed in the presence of the child or the recovering parent. The abducting family member should be encouraged to cooperate in making the recovery event and aftermath as easy as possible for their child. Professionals need to obtain as much information as possible from the abducting parent about what the child has been told and what the child may believe about the abduction and the recovering parent. Care should always be taken to safeguard the child victim from witnessing the use of force against or arrest of the abducting parent. Whenever possible, the child should be given an opportunity to say goodbye to the abducting parent. Care should be taken, however, to avoid prolonged and extremely emotional farewells. Allowing a second goodbye once the child is separated from the abducting parent is not a good idea as it may prolong and worsen an already painful event. Whenever possible, the child should be allowed an opportunity to take special possessions with him or her. The child may have a pet or some possession to which he or she is attached. The Reunification Team needs to make arrangements to deal with these issues in a way that provides comfort to the child. The child should be given an explanation, in developmentally appropriate language, of what is taking place and wh~ rather than leaving the child to his or her own fears and fantasies. Professionals present at the recovery should note the child's emotions to see whether the child appears to feel guilty, fearful, happy, or confused. Children should always be reassured that what is taking place is not their fault. Professionals involved in recovery and reunification must avoid the appearance of \"taking sides\" in the issue of custody. Guidelines for Handling the Reunion of a Family Abducted Child The agency responsible for facilitating the reunion should Arrest suspect-parent away from child, if possible. Coordinate with child protective service workers regarding the need for temporary shelter and/or foster care until any outstanding custody issues are determined, left-behind parent or investigator arrives, and/or any outstanding criminal allegations are resolved. It may take months for all outstanding custody issues to be determined if the order was ex parte or there are conflicting orders. In addition foster care is an option when neither parent appears suitable. Take charge of the situation and conduct a thorough interview of the child, suspect parent, left-behind parent, and any other appropriate persons involved in the situation. Document the results of the interviews and involve all appropriate agencies. Professionals are there to enforce the custody order and should not articulate personal opinions about the case. Enforce legal orders with the least amount of physical and emotional trauma to the child. Coordinate with victim-witness advocates/mental health professionals assigned to the child and family as soon as possible. This advocate should be present at the reunion and available to assist the family with both short- and long-term reunification issues. Cancel alarms and remove the case from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) computer and all other information systems utilized during the search. 21 Reunion Scenario Following is the summary of an actual family abduction and reunion scenario. Mistakes were made in the reunion. Agencies should review the guidelines on how to facilitate the reunion of a family abducted child for tips on the \"correct\" approach for handling such a situation and formulate a contingency plan on how their agencies would handle such a reunion. Dave's son, Timmy, was abducted by his noncustodial mother when he was 4 years old. Two and a half years later, Dave located his son with help from a private investigator. He was able to get the court in the state in which the boy and his mother were living to validate his custody order and issue a pick-up order. Accompanied by local police officers he went to the house where his son and former wife were living. His son was playing in the front yard when they approached. Later Dave described the encounter by saying, 'qimmy had this horrified look on his face. His mother had told him I was dead.\" Timmy's mother, alerted by neighbors, came out into the street screaming hysterically. She grabbed one of Timmy's arms. His father tugged on the other. Finally the police took everyone to the station. After 2 hours of bitter arguing and making allegations in front of 13mmy, the abducting mother was placed in jail. Timmy went home with his father the same day to a new house and a new stepmother he had never met. 22 Special Issues of Runaway Episodes Cases involving runaway youth are particularly appropriate for a team approach, drawing on the expertise of youth service providers, mental health professionals, school counselors, and other community service professionals in assisting young people and their families. The Family and Youth Services Bureau; Administration on Children, Youth and Families; Administration for Children and Families; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has funded several demonstration projects that support improved linkages between runaway and homeless youth programs and law enforcement agencies. The purpose of these projects was to increase communication between local law enforcement agencies and runaway and homeless youth centers improve collaboration, referrals, and services for at-risk youth and their families reduce unnecessary adjudication and incarceration of these youths Forming such collaborations within communities will help all involved authorities identify the various types of children who run away in their community and the resources needed to better help those youths. For instance short-term runaways are often fairly amenable to family reunification and may only need referral to services that can assist the family in identifying problems that lead to the runaway incident and solutions that will hopefully alleviate those problems. Runaways with more serious family problems may not be candidates to return to their homes. Such situations would require authorities to provide alternative placements and other supportive services. In addition chronic runaways and those who have been \"on the street\" for a long period of time are more likely to have been victimized and exploited while gone and may have special physical and psychological needs. The first priority when recovering a runaway is to take the child to a safe place. This responsibility is often carried out by law enforcement.Then the child needs to be carefully assessed and interviewed R in a nonaccusatory way R about his or her immediate physical and emotional needs, reasons for running away, and the circumstances encountered while away. Talking with runaways about any victimization they have experienced, prior to running away or during the time they were gone, will provide important direction for future placement, treatment, and services. If information on criminal activity is uncovered while talking with them about their activities prior to or during the runaway episode, the information must be carefully recorded while remembering that the primary focus should remain on the child's emotional and physical well-being. Interviewing runaways may present certain difficulties since runaways may view police officers as a threat and may fear that the officer will \"just\" return them to their home. Children may be particularly distrustful of law enforcement if they have tried previously to report abuse and did not receive a satisfactory response. In many cases, running away is a child's way of dealing with an unresponsive system. Officers should approach runaway and thrownaway children in a nonthreatening manner and take time to build rapport with them. Law enforcement agencies need to have a written policy directing the involvement of specially trained youth service providers in this debriefing and interview process. For those communities with a Reunification Team, a local agency should have already been designated to meet this need. In communities that do not yet have a Reunification Team, law enforcement agencies need to contract with their local social service, child welfare, mental health, or other appropriate agency to secure this assistance and support. Keep in mind that an interviewer who lectures a young person about how wrong it was to run away will find it difficult to have that same child confide in him or her. If possible the interview should be conducted by a specially trained person other than the one who took the child into custody. This will help in building rapport with the runaway child. 23 Many runaway children leave home to escape sexual or physical abuse while others may have been told to leave by a parent or guardian. Returning home may not be the best or safest option for them. In such cases the interviewer will need to immediately notify the appropriate child protective services agency of those allegations. Failure to do so may constitute negligence and can involve potential civil and criminal liability on the part of the interviewer and his or her agency. This notification process needs to be part of the written policy for each agency involved in the interview process. If the runaway is in need of medical care, mental health counseling, and / or shelter, the interviewer will need to contact appropriate agencies and resources for assistance in determining how to best meet those needs. In addition check for any prior reports of child abuse, domestic violence, or other criminal behavior in the home and notify the appropriate child protection agency. Avoid enticing the child to make an untrue claim of physical or sexual abuse as a reason for running away. Rather than telling the young person that he or she will not have to return home if a parent has been abusive, set the stage for the child to feel comfortable in making a disclosure regarding his or her reasons for running away. Persons charged with interviewing runaways should have thorough training and experience in interviewing children. They also should be knowledgeable about the dynamics of abuse and its impact on young persons. Key information to ask the runaway includes Why did you leave? Where did you go? With whom did you stay? Did anyone encourage you to leave? How did you survive? Have you run away before? Why did you return? Is it safe for you to return home? Will you run away again? Is there anything I can do for you now? The responses to these questions will help determine what services the child needs and what agencies need to be contacted to provide those services.

The way in which a child is recovered and reunited with his or her family has the potential to either inflict additional trauma upon the child or help begin the process of healing. The circumstances of recovery and reunification also may have a profound impact upon the effectiveness of professionals pursuing criminal investigation and prosecution. Understanding the dynamics of the runaway child and child abductions and careful planning by multiple agencies can help professionals ensure that the child is not traumatized further and subsequent investigation and interventions on behalf of the child and family are handled as effectively as possible. 27 | I Appendices 29 II Child Abduction: Stages of Emotional Reaction in Nonfamily Abduction Cases [Adapted from C. Hatcher, J. Behrman-Lippert, C. Barton, and L. Brooks's the Reunification of Missing Children Project. Final Report. Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice, 1992, pp. 36-38. This has been adapted and reprinted with permission. All rights reserved.] Initial Reaction During the initial moments of the abduction the child's reactions are generally more primitive than adult behavior under similar circumstances. For most children within the United States, their first association is with an experience seen on television or in a movie. Behaviorally 1 of 3 patterns of freezing, panicking with crying and screaming, or making jokes. The freeze response is the most common and is accompanied by internal fear, anxiety, and thoughts of being hurt. Crying and screaming is a typical reaction if a child is physically seized. Unlike adults, children rarely attempt to flee or fight. Within each type of these responses, the child's perception of what is about to happen may vary. He or she may see the captor(s) as \"bad people.\" He or she may be afraid that something very bad is going to happen but is unsure of what it will be. Increased Victim/Abductor Interaction In the third stage of child abduction, interaction between the victim and captor will increase as a part of the child's development of simple survival strategies. Since the adult captor is able to exert extensive control over a child both mentally and physically, the child's response is usually submissive and cooperative. In these situations the child may come to realize that he or she could not survive on his or her own and that serious consequences could occur if he or she rejects the abductor. Some children will look for means of escape but will rarely utilize potential opportunities to get away. When the event is over, the child often has difficulty explaining why he or she did not use opportunities to escape. It is clear that the child's perception of the captor as being in total control is a factor in the behavior of the abducted child. Acceptance/Respect for Captors The second child abduction stage is characterized by acceptance or respect for the captor(s). The child victim may believe that if he or she cooperates, no further harm will come. The child may wish to be a hero and have thoughts of taking action against the abductor or to escape, but these thoughts rarely evolve into a plan of action. Even though the child will rarely, take action, holding on to the heroic fantasy may become an important survival mechanism. For child victims who are abducted as part of a group, obtaining food, water, and privacy during body eliminations become priority times involving limited group interaction.\" Subgroups have been found to form around the 2 principal characteristics of age and aggressiveness. Younger and less aggressive children form one cluster while older and more aggressive children align in another cluster. 30 End of Abductor Control In the fourth stage of child abduction disintegration or termination of the captor's control begins, usually by the abductor him- or herself or by other external factors. Unlike adult hostages, the child does not tend to fear that something will go wrong during surrender or rescue or experience anxiety about the loss of stability. The child's trust of, or admiration for, police officers remains relatively high. Some child victims may have difficulty believing that the abduction event is over, even after they are rescued. End of Abduction The rescue of the child is accomplished in the fifth stage of child abduction. Supportive physical exchanges take place between the child victim and police officers. The child usually has a lot to say and is quite willing to talk to police at length about the incident. In fact recovered children may demonstrate greater willingness to talk openly and at length with unknown police officers than with parents. This may be due to feelings that the child has not lived up to parental expectations or that he or she was somehow responsible for the abduction. Parents are usually very emotional at reunification, and some children may assume responsibility for their parents' emotion and feel that the whole event was somehow their fault. 31 Nonfamily Abductions: Post-Recovery Response Patterns of Children [Adapted from C. Hatcher, J. Behrman-Lippert, C. Barton, and L. Brooks's the Reunification of Missing Children Project. Final Report. Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice, 1992, pp. 167-170. This has been adapted and reprinted with permission. All rights reserved.] At the time the child is recovered, both initially and for several days afterward, a specific response pattern is seen. The immediate post-recovery response pattern is divided into 5 stages. 1 Brief Euphoria The first stage is brief euphoria lasting from minutes to less than a day. The euphoria is then replaced by mistrust and restraint, guided by the child's concern that the return may actually be a false event or test engineered by the abductor. As a result, child victims may be somewhat flat in their emotions and will be less responsive to questions. Immediate family members may feel confused by the child victim's restraint or the loss of the child's initial positive reaction to reunification. Hyperarousal The second post-recovery response stage is hyperarousal and may last for a number of days following recovery. Both the child and family members are overstimulated by attention from law enforcement, the media, friends, and others including well-intentioned and over-zealous well-wishers. During this time the child victim and family will often talk to anyone who approaches him or her. Family members need to be educated about potential attention demands and the various types of individuals who make them in order to protect them from unnecessary outside pressures. Hypervigilant Recall During this stage child victims often want to recall the details that they have so carefully stored away as part of their abduction survival strategy. They do so in order to assist with the investigation and to have people understand the experience. Because the recall of details can also be very painful, the child may experience some ambivalence about remembering and talking about them. For children whose coping style during the abduction was to distance themselves from the experience by blocking or avoiding details, the information may come out in a more sporadic manner over time. It is not unusual for children to reveal significant details regarding the abduction after their initial statements. Children usually avoid disclosure if the information is highly emotionally charged or if they do not view the information as significant initially. Clinically it may take 6 months for all details to emerge. Delayed disclosure of important details may produce frustration for law enforcement officers during. the investigation, as well as for family and caregivers. It is important for those adults to understand the child's viewpoint and motivations around delayed disclosure of details. 1These 5 stagesof post-recovery response patterns were also repotted by Richard H. R/~lie arid Ellen DeherFder in \"Adaptation To and Recovery From Captivity Stress.\" Military Medicine, 1983, pp. 577-585. 32 Compliance/Resistance The recovered child may enter the stage of compliance/resistance anywhere between hours to weeks following reunification. At the time of recovery victims comply initially with requests, primarily because that is what they had to do in order to survive the abduction event. This strategy continues after recovery becoming an ongoing response to authorities around the victim. Covert as well as overt requests may be responded to by the child. This can particularly be an important factor in the child's later adjustment if the requests more for personal curiosity or gain rather than in the interest of the investigation or reunification of the family. These types of requests and responses will later be recognized by the child and family as a secondary injury. As feelings of personal resourcefulness return, the child's resistance to requests increases. This resistance can be directed toward requests from investigators and prosecutors as well as mental health and sodal service professionals. Denial and Help-Seeking During this stage the child's responses alternate between denial and help-seeking. This stage can develop within days and last from weeks to months. Often the child victim will cover over significant internal emotional difficulties and insist that there are no problems in an attempt to recover the stability he or she felt prior to the abduction event. 33 Family Abductions: Post-Recovery Response Patterns of Children [Adapted from \"Reunification of Parentally Abducted Children\" by C. Hatcher, J. Behrman-Lippert, C. Barton, and L. Brooks. Reunification of Missing Children Manual. W/~shington, D.C.: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice, 1992, pp. 198-226. This has been adapted and reprinted with permission. All rights reserved.] Unique response patterns for recovered children in family abduction cases may be observed initially following recovery and may last for days, weeks, or even months. Much to the surprise and disappointment of recovering parents, children who have been parentally abducted may exhibit emotional bluntness upon reunification. The bluntness may have a disassociative quality. This emotional apathy may be related to the child's feelings of conflict and confusion or to concerns about what to expect. For children who have been told that the other parent abandoned them or was dead, it is a big step to move from perceiving the parent as dead or having abandoned them to a perception that a parent is alive and has constantly searched for them. If there are new stepparents or siblings, the child may be angry that the recovering parent's life has continued while the child was missing. The recovered child may be angry or ambivalent. The child may struggle with feelings of betrayal towards either or both parents. Lack of Control A child who has been abducted by a parent may perceive that he or she has been treated as an object and moved around with no consideration of his or her desires. The child may be frustrated by a lack of control over the events of his or her life, from the initial abduction to the events surrounding recovery to post-recovery placement. In response, the child may experience anger and anxiety about the future. He or she may try to regain a sense of control through acting out behavior or by seeking to achieve in areas where the child perceives a sense of control. The child may respond by regression, reverting to behavior more appropriate for a younger child. In some cases the child will respond by becoming compliant in order to minimize or guard against additional losses. Belief Confusion The recovered child may exhibit a great deal of confusion about who to believe and trust. The explanations given the child by the abducting parent regarding the motivation for the abduction will determine to varying degrees the child's beliefs about the behavior and the interest of the parent in the child. The explanations about the abduction and the events leading up to it given by the abducting parent and the recovering parent often will vary dramatically. Professionals involved in the recovery of the child may present a picture that is somewhere between the two. The recovered child may not know which parent or explanation to accept. The child may have difficulty integrating an alternate view. At the very least, the child gets the impression that both parents can not be right in their statements. Learning that his or her perceptions have been wrong may have the impact of shattering and undermining the child's trust and confidence in his or her ability to understand the world. Fear Depending upon what the child was told or believed to be true about the recovering parent, he or she may experience additional fears and issues related to reunification. At the time of recovery the child may believe that the recovering parent abandoned them or died. If the child was convinced the recovering parent was an evil person or posed a threat, he or she will understandably be afraid of that parent. In such cases professionals- involved in the reunification should consider conducting the reunification in stages and over a period of time. The recovered child may have initial concerns about safety and 34 reabduction. These fears may be expressed in direct statements or through statements or through dreams, reabduction play, and sleep difficulties. The child's fear may become more pronounced in anticipation of the first post- recovery contact or visitation with the abducting parent. Role and Identity Confusion Cases in which a child was made to change his or her name and role may present particular difficulties. If the names of the child and abducting parent were changed and used over a long period of time, the child may be confused about his or her real name and that of the parent. The child may only identify or understand himself and the abducting parent by the assumed name. The child may also be confused about the abducting parent's different names. In some cases children do not realize that the parent is \"known\" by 2 different names and believe that the \"person\" with the assumed name and the \"person\" with the real name represent different individuals. The child may have difficulty understanding his or her role in relation to the abducting parent depending upon which name is used. During an interview the child's response may depend on whether the questions asked use the abductor's assumed name or legal name. Name changes may also occur with the recovering parent if there has been a legal name change or a remarriage. The child may perceive that the recovering parent with a new name is no longer his or her parent. These factors are important for both treatment and forensic purposes. Divided Loyalties Despite the circumstances of the abduction the recovered child often will develop a dependency upon the abducting parent. It is not unusual for the child to feel protective toward the abductor and want to shield him or her. A recovered child may be happy and relieved to see the recovering parent and at the same time feel intense loyalty to the abducting parent. The recovering parent's need for validation may exacerbate the child's conflict. In order to preserve a personal sense of safety the recovered child may adapt or assume loyalty to the parent he or she is with and overtly assume the attitudes and behavior he or she believes is expected. Guilt and Shame The recovered child may struggle with guilt and shame about the abduction event, particularly if he or she was made a co- conspirator by the abducting parent. It is important for professionals to understand the child's beliefs and level of knowledge about the abduction event. If the child was aware that they were abducted during the abduction period, the child may feel responsible for not seeking help or discovery. If the child learns that the abducting parent's description of the other parent was not truthful, the child may feel guilty about accepting that description. An abducting parent will often invite the child to live with him or her. The child may not understand the consequences of this type of invitation, readily agreeing to whatever the abducting parent wants to hear. As a result the child may feel guilt over his or her participation in the process. The child may have been asked by the abducting parent to tell lies under threat of injury or discovery. The child may have viewed the process of helping evade discovery as a fun game; later the child may report confusion and shame about this same enjoyment. An abducted child may not be aware that he or she was abducted. Upon realization of the truth, the child may feel guilty about not knowing or understanding the events around the abduction. Abandonment During the abduction period the child may have perceived the recovering parent as abandoning him or her. In some cases the child may have had limited or no contact at all with the abducting parent for weeks or months after recovery. As a result the child may have felt abandoned or that he or she was forced to abandon the abducting parent. The child may have to deal with feelings of abandonment with both parents. The recovered child may test the genuineness and security of the recovering parent through demands for attention and affection. These demands may be overstated or may be expressed through putting themselves into potentially dangerous or unsafe situations. 35 Training and Information Resources A body of knowledge and literature about missing children and related issues has developed in the past 5 to 10 years. Very little of this information, however, is readily or easily available to practitioners at the present time. The Missing and Exploited Children's Program in the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice, has funded the major studies and projects completed in the last few years. Other projects are currently underway.

Multiple agencies may serve the same children and families without coordination. No one agency has a complete picture of the child, because each is holding different pieces of the puzzle. Many missing and exploited children suffer multiple types of victimization and require special services. M/CAP's mission is to help communities improve their response to child victims and their families, including missing and exploited children, through the development of effective multidisciplinary, interagency teams and strategies. M/CAP fosters the development of a dynamic process that enables front-line agency staff to work together on an ongoing basis to identify problems and design workable solutions. Composition of M/CAP Teams is made up of line staff and middle management from all of the agencies involved with victimized and at-risk children including law enforcement, social services, mental health, courts, prosecutors, schools, medical, guardian ad litems, nonprofits, and juvenile probation. M/CAP Teams receive training and technical assistance on issues identified by Team members and opportunities to network with M/CAP Teams and other organizations around the country. Teams also have access to special resources related to missing and exploited children including specialized publications, guides, and resource materials. Working together, M/CAP Teams and Public Administration Service staff have produced a number of innovative approaches to working with missing and exploited children. These resources include multiagency guidelines for reporting and investigating these cases; policies and procedures for background checks for youth/child service agencies; family/juvenile court policies to promote exchange of information; case management practices for more informed case disposition decisions by courts; school policies and procedures for flagging, recording, and documenting school transfer records to prevent concealment of abducted children; and public awareness and prevention programs. Other products include a 40-hour training course on investigation of missing, abducted, and exploited children cases; procedures for the analysis of crimes against children; CASEMAN Management Software; Rapid Response Protocol to Child Abduction; and training on recovery and reunification of missing children. M/CAP Teams are able to improve interagency communication and cooperation, build more substantive cases, expedite services to children and families, reduce duplication of efforts, and identify new resources and make better use of existing resources. As a result M/CAP Teams are able to become more effective at preventing victimization and lessening the trauma experienced by children and their families. M/CAP was created and funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in the U.S. Department of Justice. For more information contact Ronald C.
