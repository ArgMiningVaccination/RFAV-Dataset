Our physicians will guide you to finding this balance, by working with you as a team, and supporting patient autonomy. We evaluate each patient individually by careful listening to gather a detailed history, exam, and obtaining the necessary laboratory tests or imaging studies. We will help formulate a plan to optimum wellness for each patient individually using our expertise in both allopathic and holistic medicine. This often includes the fundamentals of health: dietary modification, daily body movement, stress reduction and supplements. We also may recommend other healing modalities like chiropractic care, acupuncture, mental health therapy, massage therapy and naturopathy, via our well established network of alternative practitioners. Only when truly needed, we will add prescription medications, further imaging tests and referrals to well trusted specialists. We offer multiple visit types, dependent on each individual's needs, which include: Adult Physical Exams Infant and Well Child Exam Newborn, Pediatric and Adolescent Care Womens Health Mental Health Office Procedures Cosmetic Skin Procedures Chronic Disease Management: - Thyroid disorders - Diabetes - Depression and Anxiety - Migraines - Hypertension - High Cholesterol - ADHD - Fatigue - Eczema - Asthma - Allergies Same Day Visit for Acute Illness: - Urinary Tract Infections - Strep Throat - Ear infections - Upper Respiratory Illnesses - Skin infections - Influenza - Sinus infections - Rashes - Pink Eye Meet the Synergy Providers Jennifer Lake, MD Holistic Family Physician Jennifer Lake, MD is board-certified in Family Medicine as well as Alternative and Integrative Medicine. Her training began with an undergraduate degree in Biology at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. She then completed Medical School at the University of Minnesota-Duluth, and residency at the Family Practice program at St. John's Hospital in Maplewood, Minnesota. She began practicing as a Family Medicine Physician after graduating in 2004. After several years of general family practice, Dr. Lake realized that she had more to offer in her role as a healer than prescribing medications, ordering tests or recommending surgeries. She also learned that her patients were not just a condition or disease, but rather a whole person who needed care. She then, along with Dr. Perry, obtained additional training in Integrative and Holistic Medicine. She was intrigued by the natural therapies that were available for almost all conditions and strived to gain additional knowledge of these treatment options. Synergy Family Physicians, as an integrative family medicine clinic, has allowed Dr. Lake to care for each patient individually, as a whole- mind, body and spirit. She feels that by incorporating several treatment modalities for medical conditions, each patient is allowed the maximum advantage for healing. Although she sees patients of all ages and genders, Dr. Lake has a special interest in mood disorders, skin conditions, pediatrics and gastrointestinal health. Dr. Jennifer Lake grew up in Richfield, MN and currently lives in Blaine, MN with her husband and three children. Her interests include spending time with family, travel, golf, exercise, yoga, cheering for the Vikings, and fine dining. Danielle Perry, MD Holistic Family Physician Danielle Perry, MD is board-certified in Family Medicine and Integrative Medicine. She has an undergraduate degree in Biology from the University of St. Thomas. She then attended Medical School at the University of Minnesota, graduating in 2001. Dr. Perry then completed her Family Medicine Residency at St. John's Hospital in Maplewood, Minnesota, and has been in practice as a Family Physician since 2004. Dr. Perry has always had an interest in alternative medicine, and during college contemplated attending Naturopathic school rather than medical school, but ultimately chose allopathic medical school, taking as many alternative medicine electives as allowed. She held out hope that someday she would be able to blend the best of both worlds, and after several years in a traditional Family Medicine setting, began formal training in Integrative Holistic Medicine prior to seeing her professional dream come to reality at Synergy. Dr. Perry enjoys all aspects of Family Medicine, with a special place in her heart for newborn and infant care along with the joys of helping educate parents on how to keep their children healthy as well as themselves. She enjoys working as a team with patients dealing with chronic health issues to find physical and emotional healing through a variety of treatment options. With Dr. Perry you will find an empathetic, non-judgemental listener striving for accurate diagnosis and excellent care. She will spend time to educate you on what is happening with your body and why treatment options are being recommended. Dr. Perry grew up in Lino Lakes and currently lives in Blaine with her husband and children. Her interests outside of medicine include salsa and ballroom dancing, cycling, gardening, travel, and spending time with family.

Corey Schuler FNP-C, CNS Holistic Family Nurse Practitioner Corey Schuler, FNP-C, CNS Corey grew up in rural Granite Falls, Minnesota on a multi-generational family farm.
