Despite global efforts toeradicate it, the most recent report by the World Health Organiza-tion demonstrates a halt toward this goal [1]. In fact, 405000deaths are estimated to have taken place in 2018, of which 67%were children under the age of 5, one of the most vulnerable groups [1]. This represents a slight improvement, in comparison to 2017, in terms of mortality; however, the incidence ratechange has slowed dramatically in the last 4 y, revealing that, globally, the burden of this disease remains an issue toward erad- ication. The protozoan responsible for this disease, the Plasmo- dium sp., is transmitted through the bite of a female Anopheles sp. mosquito. Of the 5 human infecting species, Plasmodium falci- parum and P. vivax represent the highest burden and the majority of cases [1 -4].P. falciparum remains the most prevalent and deadly, particularly in Africa, with increasing resistance to anti-malarial therapy and reports of severe malaria cases, while P. vivax represents an additional problem of recurrence derived from its ability to remain in the host s liver as an hypnozoite, a dormant parasitic form that can reactivate and cause the disease later on[1, 5]. Overall, the World Health Organization s eradication program faces several obstacles. Reports reveal that important factors -in- cidence and burden, for instance -show signs of slow evolution, particularly in Africa and India [1]. Other problems are responsible for this outcome, such as a difficult access to antimalarial thera- pies and healthcare, inadequate funding, and, in some cases, cul-Authors Lucia Mamede, Allison Ledoux, Olivia Jansen, Michel Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rich of Center of InterdisciplinaryResearch on Medicines (CIRM), University of Li\u00e8ge, Belgium Key words phenolic compounds, malaria, Plasmodium , antimalarials, antiplasmodial, natural compounds received December 16, 2019 revised March 27, 2020 accepted March 29, 2020 Bibliography DOI https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1148-9000 published online April 23, 2020 | Planta Med 2020; 86: 585 - 618 \u00a9 \u00b7 New York Dr. Fax: + 3243664332m.frederich@ulg.ac.beABSTRACT Malaria is a parasitic disease endemic to tropical and subtrop- ical regions responsible for hundreds of millions of clinicalcases and hundreds of thousands of deaths yearly. Its agent,thePlasmodium sp., has a highly variable antigenicity, which accounts for the emergence and spread of resistance to allavailable treatments. In light of this rising problem, scientistshave turned to naturally occurring compounds obtained fromplants recurrently used in traditional medicine in endemic areas. Ethnopharmacological approaches seem to be helpful in selecting the most interesting plants for the search of newantiplasmodial and antimalarial molecules. However, thissearch for new antimalarials is complex and time-consumingand ultimately leads to a great number of interesting com-pounds with a lack of discussion of their characteristics. Thisreview aims to examine the most promising antiplasmodialphenolic compounds (phenolic acids, flavonoids, xanthones, coumarins, lignans, among others) and derivatives isolated over the course of the last 28 y (1990 -2018) and discuss their structure-activity relationships, mechanisms of action, toxic-ity, new perspectives they could add to the fight againstmalaria, and finally, the difficulties of transforming these po-tential compounds into new antimalarials.Natural Phenolic Compounds and Derivatives as Potential Antimalarial AgentsReviews 585Mamede et al.

Published online: 2020-04-23tural barriers in the use of modern therapies [1]. Undeniably, these complications are intrinsically connected and, ultimately,lead the population to find other solutions. Traditional medicine is still recurrently used to treat many in- fectious diseases [6, 7]. The availability, low cost, and traditionalknowledge that conveys trust in its efficiency are factors that swaypopulations to rely deeply on plants [8]. Ethnopharmacology hasallowed the combination of both traditional and modern pharma- ceutical approaches in order to discover novel compounds and screen them for diverse activities [7, 8]. Particularly in malaria, agreat number of decoctions, teas, and other preparations fromplants are traditionally used across different endemic countries[6, 7]. Their advantage is that acute toxicity is unlikely since theiruse was established from centuries of experience of trial and error[9, 10]. Additionally, this incommensurable pool of compoundshas already contributed to the majority of modern antimalarials [ 4 ,6 ,7 ,9 -12]. Examples are quinine and artemisinin, which are largely used today [3, 9, 13 -16]. These compounds paved the way for synthetic antimalarial derivatives to be designed and nowrepresent the foundation of the antimalarial therapies, both in theform of ACTs and individually [15 -17]. In the same way, other nat- ural compounds could contribute in a similar fashion. Phenoliccompounds and their derivatives are a group of phytochemicalsubstances found in virtually every plant. Despite their wide pres- ence and recognized value for health purposes, they are one ofthe least explored classes, and there is a lack of an integral review on their characteristics and effects on the malaria parasite. This review aims to integrate and discuss the most promising antiplasmodial phenolic compounds and derivatives isolated fromplants over the last 28 y (1990 -2018). To gather relevant informa- tion, reviews and single publications from that time period weresearched on PubMed, Science Direct, SciFinder, and similar data-bases using relevant keywords, such as the classes of phenolic compounds and malaria and/or Plasmodium sp. [2, 7,13, 14,18 - 27]. Compounds were selected according to their IC 50(\u00b5M) in in vitro assays established as 2 \u00b5M or less, as ac- cording to several reviews that deem it as an acceptable limit pre- dictive of progress into drug development [22, 28]. Attention was given to cytotoxicity tests to attain the SI, the measurement ofdifferentiated toxicity toward the parasite, and to the plant sh i s - tory as a traditionally used medicine [9]. The purpose of this re-view is to highlight and compare potential antimalarial hits withinthe phenolic phytochemical class and to discuss structure-activity,MoA, and new perspectives these compounds could add to thefight against malaria.

Lead Phenolic Antimalarial Compounds from Plants Phenolic compounds are frequent in plants and are distributed within numerous phytochemical classes. They are broadly definedby their molecular structure, with 1 or more aromatic rings, with-out a nitrogen, originated from plant s metabolism pathways of the shikimate and/or acetate. The shikimate pathway starts fromthe same-named acid, which in turn originates aromatic aminoacids that, after deamination, create cinnamic acid and deriva- tives, like phenylpropanoids. The acetate pathway originates - polyketide acids that can undergo cyclization steps to create phe-nolic compounds. From these routes, distinct groups of com-pounds can be identified, such that a hydroxyl group is associated to thearomatic ring, either free or as a part of other chemical functions,(e.g., esters, ethers, or glycosides). When this functional structure is repeated, the compound is named a polyphenol [29, 30]. Phe- nolic compounds incur oxidation reactions easily, which makes them strong radical scavengers. Phenolic Acids, Phenols, and Derivatives Phenols are aromatic compounds that occur very rarely in a freeform in a plant, usually being present glycosylated or as polyphe- nols. Similarly to other phenolic derivatives, when ingested orally, glycosides might be hydrolyzed in the digestive tract, which re-leases the aglycone. These compounds are derivates of the ben-zoic acid and can be hydroxylated, as in the case of the derivativesof gallic acid and its dimer, ellagic acid [30]. Although simple, thisclass has prompted interest in some isolates: methyl gallate ( 1) and compounds with ellagic acid ( 3), and curcumin Fig. 2 . Methyl gallate ( 1)e x i s t s widely in the plant s kingdom and, more importantly, is reported in plants traditionally used against malaria [31]. With many testi-fied activities, such as antibacterial and antiviral, ( 1) has been con- sidered a substance of interest since the 1980s [32]. An in vitro test with a variation of exposure time with the multi-resistant strain Dd2 was performed to determine the stage-specific activityof (1). Contrarily to quinine, which significantly affected the para- site growth throughout the entire life cycle, compound ( 1) had its highest activity on the late stages of the parasite (late trophozoite and schizont) [31], thus possibly limiting its effectiveness againstthe disease [31]. In spite of its demonstrated synergy with quinineor additivity with artemether, its highly variable IC 50between dif- ferent strains cautions for limited activity, particularly against re-sistant strains [31]. Although its MoA has not been elucidated,data suggests the hydroxy groups of the gallate moiety could playa pivotal role as donors in the establishment of bonds where the compound would exercise its activity. Other compounds with thegallate/galloyl moiety have been reported to have antimalarial ac- tivity, some of which will be explored in this review. Unfortu-nately, these compounds have broad IC 50values, and it is not clear if they are selective toward the parasite. It would seem these moi-eties alone are not sufficient to produce potent antimalarials, buttheir existence might improve this activity, which will be discussedlater [33,34]. Ellagic acid ( 3) is a common metabolite found across over 40 species of plants and vegetables like the pomegranate fruit, a well-known source [35 -37]. Present freely or in complex com- pounds (ellagitannins), it s constituted by a hydrophilic moiety, 4 hydroxyls, and a lipophilic moiety, 2 hydrocarbon rings that ren-der it the capability to act both as an acceptor and donor of elec-trons. This activity makes ( 3) act as a preventive and potent anti- oxidant, with the capability of passing the cellular membranes andentering the parasite. However, it has been reported that this same structure diminishes its oral bioavailability [30, 35 -37]. In the malaria context, ( 3) has demonstrated a high degree of activ- ity. Its presence as the active component in several traditionallyused plants against malaria has originated many studies and gen-erated great interest [33, 35, 38]. Some assays also demonstrateellagic acid s curative and prophylactic effects in vivo .F o re x a m - ple, Soh et al. [37] demonstrated that in mice infected with Plas- modium vinckei petteri treated with ( 3) at 1, and 100 mg/kg/ day intraperitoneally in a 4-day suppressive test, the effective dose was inferior to 1 mg/kg/day and, above this dose, a full inhi-bition of parasite growth was attained. Additionally, at 50 and100 mg/kg/day, no recrudescence was detected over the next60 days. Likewise, at 10 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally for 4 days be-fore inoculation, a high protective effect was demonstrated, as-suring survival by day 9 post-infection. After oral administration,however, the results were in line with the known low bioavailabil- ity of this compound [30,35, 36]. Even at the highest dose of 1 g/ kg/day, no antimalarial activity was reported. Toxicity tests provedits safety in mice, with no toxicity up to 1 g/kg/day. Besides itsantiplasmodial activity in the nM range (see Table 1 ), (3)d e m - onstrated synergy artesunate in in vitro assays [37]. It s important to note that these results occur directly in the erythrocytic stage or when ad-ministered intraperitoneally and do not translate to human effec- tiveness. It is known that ellagic acid s activity in the erythrocytic cycle occurs on the trophozoite and early schizont forms of theparasite, the most active regarding DNA and protein synthesis[37, 39]. When compared to ellagitannins, which have a betteroral absorption and can be metabolized into free ellagic acid, theIC 50is over 10 times the needed concentration for ( 3)f o rt h e same in vitro activity [35]. The MoA of ( 3) is also a matter of dis- cussion. One of the mechanisms might be similar to quinolines, preventing the formation of hemozoin. Its flat molecular structure endows it a dispersed electronic density that allows the formationof a -complex [40]. Another mechanism might be the inhibi- tion of enzymes responsible for the digestion of hemoglobin, likeplasmepsins, although this occurs in concentrations too high incomparison to those presented in Table 1 ;s e eFig. 1 for con- text [40]. Finally, in theory, it might act through its chelatingproperties, with the formation of coordination bonds with the iron present in heme [40]. Ultimately, ( 3) demonstrates a broad range 587Mamede L et al. Natural Phenolic Compounds ...Planta Med 2020; 86: 585 -618 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. of mechanisms and a high selectivity toward the parasite, but its low oral absorption has to be circumvented, and its activity in a small part of the parasite s cycle makes it an unlikely antimalarial candidate without further optimization [37]. Curcumin ( 5) is a phenylpropane, a derivative of caffeic acid, isolated from the roots of Curcuma longa , a food plant reportedly used for over 5000 y [41 -44]. The interest in this compound orig- inated from its common dietary use, lack of toxicity, and variedpharmacological activities [42]. Studies have demonstrated its to the literature, curcumin s antiplasmodial activity in vitro ranges from 5 -30 \u00b5M, in both chloroquine-sensitive and resistant strains, well above the active threshold recognized for natural compounds [22,25, 43 -47]. In spite of this, the aforemen- tioned interesting features of ( 5) led researchers to study its MoA to reach a conclusion on what ( 5) could add to the fight against malaria. There are at least 5 proposed MoA for curcumin that al-lowed the validation of several potential targets in the parasite. First, it inhibited Ca 2+-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic Fig. 2 Molecular structures of phenolic acids, phenols and derivatives. 588Mamede L et al.

Second, it enhanced cytosolic Ca2+activity and ceramide formation, which lead to the phagocytosis of the red blood cell [47]. Third, in cer-tain conditions, like a range of concentration of 20 -100 \u00b5M and the presence of transitional metal ions, ( 5) behaves like a pro-oxi- dant, possibly through its o-methoxyphenol group and methyl- enic hydrogen, and increases ROS production, originating dam-aged DNA and proteins [43, 45,47, 48]. Fourth, ( 5) inhibits his- tone for chromatin ar- rangement and transcriptional activation [43,45 -47]. Fifth, more recently it has been demonstrated that ( 5) disrupts the parasite s microtubule structure, interfering with processes such as mero-zoite formation, invasion of erythrocytes, and nuclear division,although this was only effective at the second cycle of the sameculture [46]. Evidently, ( 5) remains an interesting compound to study in face of the ever-changing parasite. However, being hy- drophobic, curcumin has poor oral availability and is rapidly me- tabolized after administration. These characteristics represent aliability in the pursuit of turning this compound into a su ccessful antimalarial. Synthetic analogues have been reported to improveon these characteristics and have better IC 50values, as low as 400 nM [43,47]. Compound ( 6) is a catechol derivative known as the main sec- ondary metabolite of the Pothomorphe genus, a group of Brazilian plants used traditionally for malaria [21,49]. It has a good activity against the multidrug-resistant strain K1 (with an IC 50of 0.67 \u00b5M), and it presents low toxicity to mouse 3 T3 fibroblastcells, with an acute oral LD 50(median lethal dose) in female Swiss mice of > 2 g/kg [49]. This compound demonstrated hemolyticproperties in human erythrocytes in a wide range of concentra-tions, which would caution against administration to malaria pa-tients [49]. In vivo toxicity studies demonstrated no death at an oral dose of 2 g/kg, but changes in mice behavior, such as agita- tion, reduced water and food consumption, and diarrhea were ob-served [49]. This could be associated with hemolysis or othertypes of toxicity that make this compound and its derivatives un-likely antimalarials. Regarding the antiplasmodial activity, cate-chols are thought to act by their antioxidant activity, possiblythrough their iron chelating properties or the inhibition of theDNA synthesis, although this is not known with certainty [40,49]. Coumarins and Derivates Coumarin, 1,2-benzopyrone, is the basic molecular structure thatcharacterizes this class of compounds. Further modifications mayensue, such as O- or C-prenylation, cyclization, and other transfor-mations, that may lead to other derivatives, the case of fu-ranocoumarins or pyranocoumarins [30]. These compounds have been the basis for the discovery of some drugs, like warfarin, but are generally known to have limited pharmacological activity [50].In the case of malaria, the isolated molecules corresponding tothe criteria are presented in Table 2 andFig. 3 . It is difficult to find highly active antiplasmodial compounds within this class, and there is evidence of a great distinction be-tween sensitive and resistant strains, as evidenced in Table 2 . However, coumarins have been identified as the active compo- nents in some plants used traditionally against malaria [8,51].Table 2 Coumarins and derivatives.

Compound ( 7) was identified in the rhizome parts of Angelica purpuraefolia Chung, a Korean plant used in folk medicine, after extract tests revealed antiplasmodial activity [52]. Two com-pounds were isolated and deemed responsible for the extract s activity. Structurally, the difference between ( 7)a n dt h eo t h e r compound, ((+)-3 -Decanoyl-cis-khellactone), is the position of the lipophilic chain from carbon 4 to 3 . This sole change repre- sents an increase in antiplasmodial activity (IC 50of 2.4 \u00b5M \u00b1 0.2) and, consequently, in SI (> 62.5) [52]. It could prove useful tostudy further the structural implications of both compounds in or-der to establish structure-activity relations. Compound ( 8) was isolated and identified from Phyllanthus niruri L., a plant widely distributed in Indonesia with traditional ap- plication in malaria [51]. In vitro in the FCR-3 multidrug-sensitive strain, the activity was barely within the interesting range in dis- cussion (< 2 \u00b5M), and unfortunately, no toxicity tests were per- formed. Microscopical observations detected a stagnation in thering stage accompanied by morphology changes in the parasite;however, no debate ensued [51]. It is possible to infer that ( 8) exerts antiplasmodial activity in the early stages, possibly affect-ing hemoglobin digestion or other metabolomic pathways. Clausarin ( 9) was isolated and later identified as one of the antiplasmodial constituents of Clausena harmandiana Pierre, a plant from Thailand [53]. Although its antiplasmodial activity is high (0.26 -1.84 \u00b5M), only 1 strain was tested, and no discussionon toxicity was made [53]. In parallel, another coumarin, dentatin, was also isolated in the same assay. The structural difference be-tween the 2 is an additional prenyl group and an hydroxyl group,instead of a methoxy group [50, 53]. This alone represents a 20-fold difference between activities, revealing the importance thatthe solubility, electromagnetic distribution, and proton availabili-ty have in the antiplasmodial activity. Trans isolated from Zanthoxylum chilope- rone var.angustifolium Engl., a tree endemic to central and south- ern South America, traditionally used to treat malaria [8]. In vitro assays with multiple strains revealed various levels of activity, withthe highest effect on the chloroquine-sensitive F32 strain (IC 50of 1.46 \u00b5M) [8]. The compound s toxicity was tested on MCR5 cells and erythrocytes. Results revealed no hemolytic properties andan IC 50of 12.85 \u00b5M on the MCR5 cells, which does not award the compound a great selectivity toward the parasite [8]. The MoA of this class of compounds is unknown. There is the possibility of formation of adducts with heme, which is the casewith trans -avicennol ( 10) [8]. Whatever the MoA, the presence of hydroxylic groups and carbon chains appears to influence greatlythe level of activity. The compound ( 8), with a gallate moiety, fur- ther evidences this structural importance. In any case, it is possi-ble to derive synthetically compounds of interest from this class [52].

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Flavonoids Flavonoids are one of the most abundant and frequently occurring classes of natural compounds. They are broadly present throughthe entire plant kingdom and, consequently, are consumed dailyin the human diet [4, 30, 50, 54, 55]. The skeleton is based on aring framework (C6-C3-C6), in which the A and B rings are aro- matic and the C ring interconnects both. The connection between the C and B ring differentiates structurally the classes of com-pounds, likewise with the saturation at C-2-C-3 or its substitutes[4, 30,55]. This structure is strongly correlated to the classes pharmacological activities as anti-inflammatory and antioxidants.Similarly to other phenolic compounds, flavonoids do not freely but as biflavonoids or glycosides [4, 50, 55]. As one of the most plentiful secondary metabolites, when plants are analyzed for the possible presence of antiplasmodial compounds, flavonoids are frequently referenced [4]. Followingthis research, the flavonoids relevant for this review are enumer-ated in Tables 3 and 4and showed in Fig. 4 . Although this phytochemical class proved to be highly active, which at firstwould be expected, considering its structural diversity, a conceptof variety of chemical structures applied to malaria is quickly re-futed upon examining the tables. Of the 34 compounds exposed in Table 3 , 25 are flavones and biflavones, 7 are biflavanones, and only 1 other flavanone and 1 flavanolol are present. Table 4presents an additional group of 7 catechins with antiplasmodial activities. This demonstrates a preference for the benzo- -pyrone structure and for the connection of the B ring at the C-2. The selected flavones appear in 4 forms: glycosides, preny- lated, simple, or biflavones. Compounds ( 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 40, 41, 42 ,a n d 43) are all glycosides, with the sugar being either a rhamnose or a glucose. Compound ( 13) has a rhamnose bonded at the C-7 and all oxygens, namely at C-5, C-6, C-3 ,a n dC - 4 ,a r e acetylated, impairing its direct ability to be oxidized. Interestingly,in spite of this, this compound is highly active against both resist-ant, IC 50of 0.52 \u00b5M 0.63 \u00b5M (NF54) [56]. Comparing it to a similar compound isolated simulta-neously but with hydroxylic groups in these positions instead, theactivity is also significantly better for ( 13). Only the SI would be the final indicator on whether this compound could be ideal as an antiplasmodial. Unfortunately, that information could not befound [56]. Compounds ( 15-18and40-43) were isolated from 2 American trees not used traditionally for antimalarial purposes[13]. The first group is bonded to a glucose and the second to arhamnose at C-3. The most active compounds, both against thesensitive and resistant strain, are ( 42), (40), and ( 15). Compounds (15)a n d( 40) have different sugars but are both trans isomers, and considering the coumaroyl moieties, are fairly more active than their ciscounterparts. Compound ( 42) has 1 coumaroyl moi- ety in cisand another in trans and remains more active against the sensitive strain at an IC 50of 0.50 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5M (HB3) [13]. Besides the activity, the indication of the SI in this case is very revealing. These8 compounds are very active in vitro , both against P. falciparum and HeLa cells, demonstrating no particular selectivity, a strongprohibitive factor. Compounds ( 40and42) represent the excep- tion, but their disparity of activities between strains is also indica- tive of their limitations [13].Ten active flavones were isolated from the Artocarpus sp. (Moraceae), a plant traditionally used against malaria in the trop-ical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia [57]. The 10 werefound to be prenylated but notably only with isoprene groups[57-60]. Compounds ( 25and26) both have an isoprene at C-3 and C-8 respectively. The B ring differs in 1 oxygen methylationand a cyclization. Despite this, both activities are very close, withan IC 50of 0.12 and 0.18 \u00b5M in the respectively [57]. Artonin A ( 29), B ( 34), and F ( 35) have the same flavone skeleton and 3 structural differences regarding cyclization and isoprenegroups [59]. When comparing activities in the same test, the mostactive compound is ( 34), with an IC 50of 1.56 \u00b5M [59]. Consider- ing the sole molecular difference between ( 34)a n d( 29), with a representative IC 50of 4.9 \u00b5M in the same assay, it would appear the free hydroxylic group at C-5 is meaningful for activity. Com- pound ( 34)'slow SI (5.5), however, puts it at a disadvantage in re- lation to ( 35), which is slightly less active, with an IC 50of 2.2 \u00b5M, but also considerably more selective (33.0) [59]. This would leadto the conclusion that the position of the isoprene and the addi-tional ring are important for the selectivity of these compounds.Compounds ( 27and 28) further impose the importance of the isoprene group. Compound ( 28), with an isoprene at C-3, is signif- icantly active, with an 50of \u00b5M, than ( 27), with an IC50of 1.31 \u00b5M, that includes a ring in that group, leaving free a 2-methylbut-2-ene [58]. Other differences are present in the B ring, but overall it would seem the length of the hydrophobicchain is important. The same occurs between compounds ( 31 and 32). In this case, the compound with the cyclization at C-3 (31), with an IC 50of 0.02 \u00b5M, is significantly more active than (32), with an IC 50of 1.04 \u00b5M, which has 2 isoprene groups [58]. Lastly, ( 36) has 3 isoprene groups at C-3, [59]. The number of isoprene groups should increase this compound s lipophilia, even with 5 hydroxylic groups available. It would appear that the isoprene group at C-8 isimportant to increase the lipophilia of the compounds so thatthey can bypass the cytoplasmatic parasitic membrane and exertadditional effects on the parasite [60, 61]. The most cytotoxiccompounds in this group appear to have a isoprene at C-3, whichmeans cyclization at this position might at least decrease toxicity[59]. Moreover, the 10 compounds prove to be strongly antiplas- modial, although not confirmed as selective toward the parasite, questioning the safety of the use of the Artocarpus sp. [57]. Artopeden A ( 30) is a simple flavone with a C-3 cyclization and with 2 methylations. It may be that the methylations increase itslipophilia enough to have a similar activity to prenylated flavones,since their degree of activity is comparable (IC 50of 0.114 \u00b5M in the 3D7 strain) [58, 61]. Unfortunately, no further studies areavailable to discuss this compound sa c t i v i t y .3 ,4,7-trihydroxy- flavone (23) was isolated from the bark of the Albizia zygia (DC.) J. F. Macbr. tree, traditionally used in Sudan as an antimalarial[62]. Although in the same assay other flavonoids were isolated,sadly no further information regarding in vitro antiplasmodial or cytotoxicity is reported [62]. With a fairly simple chemical struc-ture, with only hydroxyl substitutions at C-7/3 /4,b o t hg o o da n t i - plasmodial and cytotoxic results were achieved, which warranteda SI of 5.

Biflavones are 2 flavone units, similar or not, connected cova- lently either through C Co rO C bonds, that occur rarely [50,63]. Four biflavones were found according to the criteria: compounds(11), (14), (19), and ( 44). Compound ( 11)h a saC - 4 -O-C-8 bond connecting 2 monomeric similar flavones. Both its activity (IC 50of 0.48 \u00b5M) and SI (159) are impressive and might be correlated to the bond between the 2 units. In the same study, compounds with a hydroxyl group at C-4 showed no activity [63]. Compound (14) is an example of a biflavone with 2 different monomeric units, an imposition by the place of the bond between the 2 mol-ecules (at C-3). Similarly, in the same study, it was demonstratedthat, if instead of another unit at C-3, the compound had a simplehydroxylic group, the antiplasmodial activity would drop signifi-cantly [64]. Although its activity is not as impressive as ( 11), it demonstrates the possible advantage of biflavones. Compounds (19and 44) are structurally similar, with the exception of a methylation at the oxygen at C-7 or C-4 . This single difference in their structure is enough to improve the activity of 2.0 and1.4 \u00b5M, respectively, and, more importantly, the selectivity of(44) over 10 times [63]. The availability of the methoxy group in the C4 position might represent an influence in bonding to spe- cific sites at the human or parasites cellular structures, enough to prevent a toxic interaction in the host s cells [63]. Overall, the sig- nificant SI of biflavones is interesting toward asserting structuralkey features. Only 1 flavanone is relevant in the context of this review: heteroflavanone C ( 33). Compound ( 33) is the most active flavo- noid, with an IC 50of 1 nM [57]. It has key features that distinguish it from the other compounds discussed thus far. First, it lacks thedouble bond between C-2-C-3; second, it has only 2 hydroxyl groups; third, the B ring has 3 oxygens that are all methylated. The availability of the C-3 might be one of the crucial points inthe establishment of a bond. Likewise, the methylation of all oxy-gens on the B ring might improve its lipophilia and allow the com-pound to enter the parasite more easily. Regrettably, no SI is giv-en, which would complement this compound s profile. Seven biflavanones are presented: compounds ( 12), (20), (21), (22), (37), (38), and ( 39). Compound ( 12) has improved activity toward the chloroquine-resistant strain [65]. Compounds ( 20- 22) were extracted from Garcinia kola sun-dried nuts, which are used traditionally as a chemo preventive of malaria in Central Afri-ca [66]. In vitro tests demonstrated the pertinence of this use: compounds ( 20-22) exhibited high antiplasmodial activity, IC 50 between 0.16 -0.65 \u00b5M, and significant selectivity (above 77) [66]. In vivo studies in mice infected with P. berghei (ANKA strain) were performed with compound ( 21) following a 4-day suppres- sive test [66]. Concentrations ranged from 25 to 200 mg/kg/day and were orally administered. The mean effective dose (ED 50) was calculated at approximately 100 mg/kg. The test demonstrat-ed improved mice survivability, no observable toxicity up to200 mg/kg/day, and a dose-dependent parasite inhibition [66].Most importantly, these results were accomplished with an oraladministration, which proves to be a great advantage toward de-veloping and studying these compounds further. Compound ( 37) does not have methylated oxygens and has the bond between theTable 4 Catechins.

Compounds ( 38and39) have the same bond as (37) but a methylated oxygen at C-4 or C-4 , respectively. Be- tween ( 38and39), there s the additional difference in isomerism of the protons at C-3 . In the same tests, compound ( 37) was the most active, with an IC 50of 0.15 \u00b5M (K1) and 0.47 \u00b5M (FCR-3), and selective (> 116) of the 3 [67]. This demonstrates that the oc-cupation of the C-3 of the flavanone by another unit is not a dis-advantage toward activity or selectivity. Flavanonol MS II (24) is a flavanolol with 2 (2,2-dimethylchro- mene) rings. In spite of having been solely tested on sensitive strains, it demonstrates a relevant variety in activity dependingon the strain (see Table 3 ) [68]. Its selectivity toward the para- site is noteworthy, proposing that resistant strains should be tested in order to assess the compound s potential. Lastly, catechins are a particular sub-group of flavonoids, dis- tinguishable by the absence of the carbonyl group on the C-ring[30]. They are abundantly found in green tea leaves ( Camellia si- nensis ) as acid esters and are known for their antioxidant proper- ties [4,69]. Hence, these compounds are frequently isolated withtheir gallate moieties, as evidenced in Table 4 . Compounds ( 45 and 46) are 2 catechins active against a chloroquine-resistant strain, with an IC 50of 1.2 and 1.0 \u00b5M, respectively, and with a re- Fig. 4 Continued 597Mamede L et al. Natural Phenolic Compounds ...Planta Med 2020; 86: 585 -618 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. markable SI (> 75). They differ solely on the position of the gallate moiety, either at C-5 or C-3, respectively. However, this does notseem to interfere with either their activity or selectivity; on thecontrary, the existence of the gallate esters seems essential to-ward their inhibitory activity, independently of the positioning[70]. Compounds ( 48, 49 and50, 51 ) are structurally related, dif- fering only on isomerism at C-2 and C-3. Studies specificallytargeting the fatty acid synthesis (FAS) have demonstrated the structural requirements for the parasiticidal effect through FAS in- hibition. Catechins with a gallate moiety at C-3 are all potent in-hibitors, while a free single hydroxyl group in the same positionseems to greatly diminish this activity [55]. Consequently, cate-chins ( 50and51) may act through this mechanism. The gallate substitution in these compounds appears crucial for their inhib-itory activity, especially considering that gallic acid alone is in-active [33, 55,71, 72]. Compound ( 47) has other properties that might award it an additional edge against malaria. The epigallocatechin gallate(47), a catechin with both a galloyl and a gallate moiety, is the most studied, with reported activity against tumor cells and as acell cycle regulator [69, 72]. It binds to adhesion molecules, pre-venting the grip of P. falciparum -infected erythrocytes to the en- dothelium of blood vessels [69]. Additionally, it inhibits the glidingmotility of sporozoites, preventing invasion and interrupting the parasite s cycle [69]. It is possible that its 8 free hydroxylic groups bind to adhesion molecules on the surface of the sporozoites, in-activating them and rendering the parasite immotile [69]. How-ever, in spite of these demonstrated advantages in vitro, in vivo data reveals otherwise. In a 4-day suppressive test with P. berghei (ANKA 0 -100 mg/ kg/day of ( 47) equivalent in the form of green tea extract were ad- ministered by gavage [73]. Instead of inhibiting, the administra- tion of the extract augmented the parasite s growth over the con- trol s own growth [73]. Thipubon et al. discuss that the com- pound s(47) highly antioxidant activity might prevent the oxida- tive damage by the mice s immune system, consequently endors- ing the parasite s growth. However, there are various studies that support either the suppression or promotion of P. berghei by com- pound ( 47), which prevents the deduction of conclusions [55, 71, 73]. Several studies have been performed in order to assess the MoA of flavonoids. There are 3 main ways they interfere with themalaria parasite. First, it is thought they inhibit the transport ofsubstances necessary for the parasite s growth; second, they might affect heme detoxification; third, as mentioned for cate-chins, flavonoids inhibit lipid peroxidation [4, 50, 54, 74 -76]. The entry of L-glutamine and myoinositol into infected red blood cellsis impaired in the presence of flavonoids [4, 77]. The way flavo- noids might interfere with heme is not entirely clarified, since their acidic nature, although weak, might prevent their entry inthe digestive vacuole, where the heme is [4]. Flavonoids are dem-onstrated radical scavengers that bind easily with metals, speciallyiron, and are able to form stable complexes with Fe (II), thereforepreventing it from partaking in other reactions, such as DNA syn-thesis and energy-enzymatic pathways, possibly starving the par-asite [4, 54,74, 76,78]. Theoretically, and similarly to synthetic iron chelators that have been studied toward P. falciparum , flavo-noids might also interfere with mosquito transmission [78]. Since iron is a key-component in the function of the gametocyte s mito- chondrial electron transport chain, chelation is thus inactivating the gametocyte [78]. Transmissiontests with flavonoids would have to be performed to confirm this.Structure-activity studies demonstrated that an o-hydroxyl on the B ring of a flavonoid, the number of free hydroxyl groups, and thedouble bond at C-2-C-3 or a C-3 hydroxyl group all contribute to these activities [4,54, 74]. All presented compounds possess 1 or more of these characteristics, imposing the possibility of antiplas-modial activity through multiple mechanisms. Moreover, this flex-ibility regarding structure is in accordance with the evidence thatmany structurally diverse flavonoids have antiplasmodial activityin a wide range of concentrations [50]. In addition, the FAS of theparasites, and to some level, of the host, are inhibited by thesecompounds [55, 77]. The di- and tri-hydroxylation of the B and A ring and the double bond at C-2-C-3 (flavanols, isoflavanols, fla- vones, isoflavones) most potent in-hibitors [50,55, 72]. This evidences the importance of both theplanarity of the C-ring and the availability of hydroxylic B-ring toward antiplasmodial activity [55]. Compounds suchas (15-18, 31, 34, 36, 40 -43) fit these characteristics. Cate- chins might have other characteristics, like the gallate moiety, tofavor their inhibition of this biosynthetic pathway, as discussed above. However, it is noteworthy that the most active compounds presented are not the ones with a di- or tri-hydroxylation of theB ring but with prenylations of this ring. This ultimately leads tothe conclusion that the compound s lipophilia is crucial for activ- ity, even if only to facilitate the entrance into the parasite. Flavonoids are known for their low toxicity to humans, with in- teresting half-lives that can go up to 28 h [55]. Additionally, their solubility and thermostability convey favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics relevant for a possible antimalarial drug, especially considering their dietary presence [4, 55]. Further studies con-cerning the SI and with differentiated strains might help elucidatethe potential of these compounds as future antimalarial drugs. Quinones, Anthrones, and Derivatives Quinones are products of the oxidation of phenolic compounds, and they occur widely in plants [30]. The quinone unit is a 6-car- bon diene cycle with 2 keto groups, o-quinone or p-quinone. These units can group and are distinguished according to theirstructure as anthraquinones, benzoquinones, furanoquinones,and naphthoquinones, among other derivatives [30,50]. isnoteworthy to mention that quinones undergo reduction to thehydroquinone form, an important property in the transferal ofelectrons in a biological system [30]. Natural quinones, and naph- thoquinones in particular, are a phytochemical class with known parasiticidal activity [3]. In malaria s case, a good example is ato- vaquone, a synthetic derivative of lapachol from the Tabebuia sp., used in combination with proguanil in Malarone, recommendedfor travelers prophylaxis [3,13, 15]. Thirty compounds were found on the literature according to the defined criteria across allsubgroups of quinones. They are presented in Table 5 and Fig. 5 . 598Mamede L et al.

Com- pound ( 60) is an active quinone with an IC 50of 0.8 \u00b5M, with low selectivity (> 1) that can undergo a redox reaction and convert toa hydroquinone, compound ( 61). This transformation does not prove useful toward P. falciparum , diminishing its activity to 1.2 \u00b5M and maintaining its low selectiveness (> 5) [79].

Thymoquinone ( 77) is a benzoquinone that was isolated from multiple plant species with antimalarial tradi-tional backgrounds [81,82]. In a first report, its strain (FCR-3) was relevant(IC 50of 1.22 \u00b5M) [81]. Since then, further studies have focused on the anticancer and antitumor potential of the compound [83]. One study reported on the synthesis of analogues toward both ovarian cancer and malaria in vitro [82]. Structure-activity studies revealed that the position of the substitution groups inthe quinone moiety proved essential, as did the hydrophobicityof the compound, with the chain substitution diminishing theantiplasmodial activity. Overall, in this study, compound ( 77)d i s - played a disparate inhibitory concentration of 25 \u00b5M, and the op-timization of the molecule s structure improved this concentra- tion only to 4.2 \u00b5M, which is still far from ideal [82]. Naphthoquinones, related to natural naphthalene, have a qui- none unit coupled with an aromatic ring that may have substitu-tions, in a total of 2 rings. Compounds ( 57and78) both fit this description. Compound ( 57) has a hydroxyl substitution in its aro- matic ring and the particularity of an endoperoxide bridge. Itshows an improved activity toward multidrug- resistant strain,with an IC 50of 0.76 \u00b5M (K1), rather than the sensitive one, with an IC 50of 1.55 \u00b5M, with an average selectivity (> 10) [84]. Com- pound ( 78), isolated from a traditionally used plant, has an inter- esting antiplasmodial activity across different strains but unfortu-nately, no selectivity [85]. In vivo studies with pure ( 78)o r a l l ya d - ministered were performed in a P. berghei model (ANKA strain) in a 4-day suppressive test [86]. Interestingly, acute toxicity assayswere also done with single oral doses of 500, 200, and 100 mg/kg body weight, and subacute assays with oral doses of 100, 50, and 25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Low toxicity was achieved at 100 mg/kg in a single dose and 25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. In spiteof no histological damage, behavioral changes, such as anxietyand agitation, were evident, and mice died with a single dose of200 mg/kg or higher, or cumulative doses of 100 mg/kg/day orhigher [86]. These results are indicative of the unideal SI. As forthe antimalarial test, a concentration of 25 mg/kg/day resulted ina 41% parasitemia suppression at day 4 with an average survival of 10 days [86]. These results are far from the control chloroquine, with 100% suppression and over 15 days survival at 10 mg/kg/day. The low oral bioavailability of ( 78) produces only 39% system- ic availability, while mostly being retained in the liver and spleen[86]. Therefore, arguably, its bioavailability could change the in vivooutcome, both in toxicity and efficiency. Structure-activity studies with both compounds ( 57and 78) undeniably confirmed the quinone structure was crucial for anti- plasmodial activity, while substitutions at C-3 were detrimental [19, 84,87]. In spite of the low SI of naphthoquinones, authors de-fend the selectivity toward cancerous cells and the parasites mitochondria, and not normal hosts cells [84]. Additionally, ( 78) is a ubiquinone analogue and has demonstrated its inhibitory ac-tivity against malarial enzymes [86]. Regardless of these argu-ments, naphthoquinones represent a lead in antimalarial researchbecause they are easily synthetized, which enables the improve-ment of their bioavailability and facilitates the search of new drugs [50]. Furanoquinones are a diverse group of compounds where a quinone unit and a furan ring are present. Compound ( 56)i saf u - ranonaphthoquinone, because in addition to the other structures,it possesses an aromatic ring, characteristic of a naphthoquinone.It demonstrates no significant difference in activity between chlo-roquine-sensitive and resistant strains and, similarly to naphtho- quinones, has a low SI (3.9) [84]. Likewise, compounds ( 58and 59) are also furanonaphthoquinones, this time inseparable com- pounds extracted from the stem bark of Tabebuia ochracea ssp. A. Gentry, traditionally used against malaria [88]. In vitro assays demonstrated a preferentiality in activity toward the chloro-quine-resistant strain. The alternate hydroxylation at C-5 or C-8proves more advantageous than the hydroxylation in both posi-tions [88]. Regrettably, the general toxicity of these compounds was not evaluated. In an in vitro test with P. berghei- infected cells, these compounds had an IC 50of 0.167 \u00b5M, allowing the predic- tion of good activity in vivo [88]. These 3 compounds demonstrate the benefit of associating the furan ring to the naphthoquinonestructure, possibly instigating a new class of antimalarials. Anthraquinones are frequent metabolites with a 3-ring skele- ton, namely1 quinone unit and 2 aromatic rings. They can be oxi-dized or reduced into derivatives in reversible reactions, and the ratio between these structures in a plant depends on several fac- tors, for example, the time of the y [30]. Because they react easily,the method of extraction is important to control the ratio andkind of compounds extracted [30]. This phytochemical class haspresented the biggest amount of antiplasmodial compounds, re-vealing its importance to traditional medicine. Knipholone ( 52) is an anthraquinone pigment found in at least 30 plants, with several known derivatives [89, 90]. Compound (53) is the anthrone derivative of ( 52); (i.e., through reductions), it loses the ketone at C-5. This change is enough to double theantiplasmodial activity, from over 1 \u00b5M to 0.4 \u00b5M, while its selec-tivity worsens significantly, from over 34 to 21 [90]. Compound(54) is similar to ( 52), but instead of an O-methyl at C-4 , it has a hydroxyl. This difference does not change the selectivity (> 40) oractivity toward the chloroquine-sensitive strain (of 1.55 \u00b5M) butdiminishes the activity against the multi-drug-resistant strain (IC 50of 1.80 \u00b5M), indicating the necessity of a hydrophobic chain at that position against a specific resistance mechanism [90].Compound ( 55) is another knipholone derivative, again with a sole difference at C-4 , with a glucopyranoside. Contrarily to (53), compound ( 55) improves both its antiplasmodial activity (IC 50of 0.7 \u00b5M) and selectivity (> 210) with this change, showing the relevance of the substitution at C-4 [91]. Knipholones anti- plasmodial properties seem to be rooted in the special phenyl-an- thraquinone skeleton, since neither structure individually has any significant activity [90, 91]. Vismiones are lipophilic anthrones originally isolated from the traditionally used against malaria [6, 92]. Other deriva- tives have been isolated in different species since and revealed theexceptional antiplasmodial activity associated with these com-pounds structure. Vismione B ( 68), D ( 69), H ( 70) and acetylvis- mione D ( 75) are all molecularly related, with changes at C-2/9 and C-7. Additionally, ( 68) has a dimethyl Med 2020; 86: 585 -618Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Although in separate tests, compounds ( 69, 68 ,a n d 75)w e r ea l l tested in vitro on the K1 strain. Compound ( 69) is more active than (75), both better than ( 68) on this strain, with IC 50of 0.23 \u00b5M, 0.85 \u00b5M, and 1.86 \u00b5M, respectively [6, 93,94]. The fact that ( 70) remains highly potent on a different strain (IC 50of 0.23 \u00b5M in the NF54 strain) allows the conclusion that either a prenyl or a geranylgroup at C-7 are equally essential for antiplasmodial activity [92,94, 95]. Regarding selectivity, however, compound ( 75) is the and safe compound [6,94]. Inclusively, Psorospermum fe- brifugum Spach, with compound ( 69), has been ill advised for con- sumption following reports of toxicity in mice [6]. Vismiaquinone A ( 71) and compound ( 72) are anthrones simi- lar to vismiones, with minor differences in their substitutions.Overall, the number of hydroxyl groups is higher. Unfortunately,the strains studied are not the same, which does not allow a com-parison, but other compounds in the same study permit further structure analysis. It would appear that the prenyl group at C-2 and the hydroxyl at C-5 are enhancers of activity, although it is un-certain if they function additively or synergistically [95]. On thesame study, compound ( 72) was the most potent antiplasmodial, possibly because it is a tri-prenylated anthrone [95]. Additionalstudies would have to be performed to analyze how these charac-teristics influence the activity of vismiones and anthrones. Re-garding ( 71), because in the same study other related compounds were not tested, it is not possible to infer structure-activity links. However, from this family of compounds, it would seem safe toconclude that the quinone substitution interferes with activityand that the substitution with increasingly lipophilic chains mightalso improve antiplasmodial activity [96]. Compounds ( 73and74) extract of Psorospermum glaberrimum Hochr., used tradition- ally for severe cases of malaria [94]. Their sole structural differ- ence is an O-geranyl or prenyl at C-4, which does not seem to in- terfere with either the activity or selectivity. It would appear,though, that anthrones with their chemical unit on an extremityare preferred activity-wise, when comparing these 2 comp A with the particularity of having a connection C-2-C-10 to an anthrone, which is a rare structure. This precise characteristic conveys better activity than a simple hydroxyl substitution [97]. Unfortunately, the selectivity is not optimal, and the complexity and rarity of thischemical structure hinders further studies with these compounds[97]. Finally, natural quinone methides triterpenes exist in nature as quinone derivatives. Compound ( 76) was isolated from Hoslundia opposita Vahl., a traditionally used plant against malaria in Tanza- nia [98]. It is a hydroquinone with a sesquiterpenoid sidechain, with its ,-unsaturated carbonyl moiety possibly responsible for a Michael reaction with the parasites structures [98]. This is, how- ever, unlikely, as this reaction has been shown to occur more in-tensively with simple benzoquinones (1,4-benzoquinone) ornaphthoquinones [99]. Compounds ( 62-67)w r ei s o l a t e df r o m Salacia kraussii (Harv.) Harv. and were found to have interesting activities. Compounds ( 62-64) have only a different substitution at C-28 sufficient to distinguish, and ( 63)h a st h em o s ta c t i v e , with an IC 50of 0.06 \u00b5M C-29 and C-30, enough to ascertain ( 67)a st h e most active and selective of the trio but not of the entire group.Compound ( 63), the most active and selective in vitro , was eval- uated in vivo and revealed both toxicity and inactivity against mu- rine malaria after oral and parenteral administration. The low SImight justify the high toxicity in vivo, and the low bioavailability explains the lack of activity. In fact, quinone methides triterpe- noids such as compounds ( 65and66) have been studied for their antitumoral activities [101,102]. It was found their quinone me-thide moiety was responsible for this effect, namely through theinduction of apoptotic pathways, be it with mitochondrial with chaperones, among otherinteractions [101 -104]. Consequently, the in vitro and in vivo lack of specificity becomes logical. These characteristics make the de-velopment of these compounds as antimalarials difficult [100, 105]. There are 2 accepted MoA for qui nones: the oxidative stress in- duction and the inhibition of the mitochondria s electron trans- port and respiratory chain. Quinones are easily reduced into deriv- atives, which, in turn, can be further reduced [30]. The capabilityof generating ROS or of a nucleophilic addition reaction on theparasite s proteins depends on the quinone, being more frequent on benzoquinones than anthraquinones or naphthoquinones, possibly because of the decreased electron flow on these struc- tures [4, 99,106]. Although claimed by many authors, it is unlikelythat quinones and derivatives undergo Michael reactions directlywith the parasite s DNA, since in physiological conditions, they are known to interact with proteins that possess thiol groups. This isnot the case with the parasite s DNA but of other proteins (e.g. chaperones) [48, 99, 101, 107]. Therefore, for the more complexand fully conjugated structures, it is accepted that they act in a similar fashion to atovaquone [25]. In the long-term, the blockage of the parasite s mitochondrial electron transport chain by target- ing the cytochrome bc 1complex interferes with the redox stasis and with the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, crucial forthe parasite s subsistence [3]. In any case, the high antiplasmodial activity of this class of compounds is balanced with the frequentlylow selectivity and bioavailability, as evidenced thus far. As withlapachol and atovaquone, synthetic derivatives might be designed and optimized; however, the existing resistance to atovaquone in- vokes the question about whether there is a necessity for newcompounds from this chemical class that will perform throughthe same MoA [3,15, 84]. Xanthones Xanthones a benzophenone [50, 108]. The great interest in these compounds is comparable to quinones because of their high in vi- troparasiticidal activity and the facility of synthesis [50,108]. The antiplasmodial activity of these compounds against both sensitiveand resistant strains, in a similar fashion to the quinoline class ofantimalarials, has made it one of the most studied phenolic phy-tochemical classes [108]. In spite of this, only 8 compounds corre-sponded to the criteria and are presented in Table 6 andFig. 6 . 603Mamede L et al.

There are 2 characteristics that stand out across the compounds presented: the prenylation and cyclization of the xanthone struc-ture. -Mangostin ( 84) is one of the most studied xanthones be- cause of its several activities: antimicrobial, and antimalarial [109]. Compounds ( 82, 87,a n d 88) are all structurally related to -mangostin ( 84), as Fig. 6 suggests. These compounds, besides the xanthone skele- ton, have in common 1 or 2 prenyl groups at C-1 and C-7 and a hydroxyl at C-6. These characteristics appear to be important for activity [109 -112]. Although this group has been tested on differ- ent strains and assays, it is possible to point out that compound(88) is the most active of the 4, with an IC 50of 0.41 \u00b5M on the W2 strain, while ( 84) retains activity mostly against the chloro- quine-resistant strains [113]. In vivo studies with ( 84) demonstrat- ed a low antimalarial activity when orally administered at 100 mg/kg/day in a 7-day test, when compared to intraperitoneal admin- istration of the same dose twice per day, from 27% to 81% chemo suppression, respectively [113]. This might be due to low bioavail-ability that hinders absorption at the digestive level [113]. In spiteof positive hemolysis results (at 69.7 \u00b5M), the SI was found to behigh enough, as demonstrated in vivo by the reduction of malaria- related symptoms and overall absence of toxicity at all levelstested (hepatic, renal, and histological) [113]. Compound ( 88) structurally differs from the others with an ad- ditional prenyl at C-4, which might indicate that lipophilia might play an important role on these compounds MoA. Further studies to evaluate the structure-activity relation of these compounds re-vealed that the prenyl group at C-1 and the C-3 arefundamental characteristics for antiplasmodial activity [50]. Inthis it would be interesting to study ( 82and88)o nd i f f e r - ent strains in order to ascertain if the double prenyl group at C-1or the carbonyl at C-2 are important toward a certain type of strain. The fact compounds ( 84and87) were isolated from tradi- tionally used plants further demonstrates their activity [112]. Compounds ( 83, 86 ,a n d 89) have incurred both prenylations and cyclization. Considering the aforementioned characteristicsfor active xanthones, compound ( 83), apparently the most active of the trio, fits the criteria and demonstrates that a cyclization atC-1-C-2 does not interfere with activity [110]. Finally, compound ( 85) has a 12-(2-methylbut-3-en-2-yl) group and a dihydropyrano ring. This structure proves to be pref- erential toward activity in comparison to other isolated structuresin the same study, particularly to the F32 and FcM29 strains [111].Likewise, with the other xanthones thus far, it stands out in thedifference in activity between chloroquine-resistant and sensitive strains. Most compounds presented have higher activities on re-sistant strains rather than the chloroquine-sensitive ones. This isodd, considering that the MoA of xanthones is defined as a com- plexation with heme, preventing the detoxification of the diges- tion of hemoglobin that, this way, kills the parasite (see Fig. 1 ) [25, 50,108, 114]. This MoA is similar to the quinoline class ofantimalarials. Resistance to chloroquine, in particular, originatesin the modification of a transporter in a digestive vacuole of theparasite, consequently altering its accumulation and preventingits activity [115,116]. The fact that xanthones are active againstchloroquine-resistant strains evidences a bypass through this mechanism of resistance, representing a lead to discover thestructural requirements to this ability. However, none of the xan- thones have a great SI, which might indicate a lack of structuralselectivity that impeaches their utilization as antimalarials. Lignans Lignans are dimeric phenylpropanoids connected by C C bonds between the -carbon of the propanoid chain [50]. When the CC bond is established differently, the compounds are termed neolignans. These compounds, shown in Table 7 and Fig. 7 , are known for their toxicity and general activity, including anti-protozoal [117]. Compounds ( 90and91) are considered neolignans because of their unusual linkage between monomeric units. Compound ( 90) is active equally against resistant and sensitive strains. In a study,3 compounds, including ( 90), were isolated and tested. Com- pound ( 90) was the most active of the 3, with an average IC 50of 0.9 \u00b5M between sensitive and resistant strains, and, structurally,that demonstrated that the double bond on C-7 -C-8 was prefer- ential for activity, possibly due to the easiness of the conjugateddouble bond to generate ROS [118]. Compound ( 91) has an un- conventional molecular structure, with a peroxide ester thatmight function similarly to the endoperoxide bridge of the arte-misinin class of antimalarials [118]. Its activity, however, is not comparable to that class of drugs, with an IC 50of over 1.4 \u00b5M, which points to a different MoA [118]. Neither compound hasgood SI, making them non-ideal for further studies. Compounds ( 92-95) were all isolated from the same Brazilian plant [117]. The in vivo activity of the hexane extract, with a para- site reduction of 67% and 48%, for the root and leaves extracts,respectively, prompted the isolation and in vitro testing of these compounds [117]. All 4 lignans proved to be very active against the chloroquine-resistant isolate (BHz 26/86), with IC 50between 0.20 and 0.63 \u00b5M [117]. It is thus possible to infer the structuralrequirements for activity: a trans orientation in the B-ring and a veratryl A-ring, with no particular difference between an O-meth-yl or a methoxy at C-3 and C-4 . Contrarily to the previous lignans and to the general idea of toxicity, these 4 compounds were foundnon-toxic on Hep G2 A16 hepatic cells [117]. This could that traditional lignans present advantages both activity- and toxicity- wise. The MoA of these natural compounds is currently unknown, although, as discussed previously, it might be linked to the gener-ation of ROS. Other Derivatives Other subgroups of phenolic compounds with relevant antiplas-modial activity are displayed in Table 8 andFig. 8 . Their individ- uality demonstrates, coupled with the compounds discussed thus far, the variability of phenolic structures with antiplasmodial activ-ity that may prove to be important for the discovery of new anti-malarials. Licochalcone A ( 96) is a chalcone, an aromatic ketone, isolated from the Chinese licorice roots [119]. It is not frequent to findchalcones in plants, as they are precursors of flavonoids andtherefore are often transformed into these compounds and deriv- atives [26,27, 50,120]. Compound ( 96) was the first to 606Mamede L et al. Natural Phenolic Compounds ...Planta Med 2020; 86: 585 -618Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. reveal the potential of the phytochemical class as antimalarials, besides as antibacterial, antiviral, and antileishmanials [26,121].Its activity was demonstrated in vitro against all erythrocytic stages of the parasite, proving the effectiveness in importantmetabolic pathways throughout the parasite s life cycle [122]. In vivo,i nP. yoelii YM-infected mice, the administration of 15 mg/kg 4 times daily intraperitoneally, for a total of 60 mg/kg, for 3 con-secutive days, accounted for parasite clearance (93%) wit hout toxicity [122]. In the same test, ( 96) was administered orally at doses of 450, 150, and 50 mg/kg/day, and it demonstrated tonearly clear the parasitemia at all doses, with no mortality by theend of the study (21 days) [122]. On the one hand, the bioavaila-bility of ( 96) allows for an ideal oral antimalarial; on the other hand, it is unclear whether the administration several times a dayand for a long period of time, at least over 3 days, would be prac-tical. This compound s MoA has been thoroughly studied: it is thought the major mechanism is the inhibition of the mitochon- dria s cytochrome bc1 complex, similarly to atovaquone [120]. However, chalcones have other MoA, different from the pathways inhibi-tion, leading to the parasite sd e a t h( s e e Fig. 1 ) [50, 120]. Struc- tural studies revealed that the B-ring proved im- portant for antiplasmodial activity, as did the number of methoxy substitutions and the hindrance caused by them, thus impeachingthe connection to the enzymes responsible for the previous steps[121, 123]. Overall, the potential of compound ( 96)a n dt h ef a - cility of creating synthetic derivatives has made chalcones a po-tential group for derivation of innovative antimalarial structures[121]. Compound ( 97) is the only lactone to fill the pre-set require- ments. It is a a 5-carbon from Phragmanthera capitate , an African parasitic plant used to treat fe- ver and parasitic diseases [ 124]. In the same study where it was isolated, a second lactone was also identified with a single struc-tural difference: the phenolic ring substitution of a hydroxyl, in-stead of a galloyl group. Although compound ( 97) does not have a promising antiplasmodial activity of its own, it is interesting tonote that the difference between the 2 compounds is over 100- fold [124]. This demonstrates undoubtably, as mentioned advantage that the galloyl moiety awards,compared to a single hydroxyl group. It is possible compound ( 97) acts in a similar way to phenols. Compounds ( 98and 99) are hexahydrodibenzopyrans with a monoterpene moiety isolated from an Amazonian plant [125].The structural difference between the 2 is a cyclization at C-1 with an oxygen in a 1 ,2-dihydrofuran. This divergence is enough to accentuate the antiplasmodial activity of ( 99) over 2-fold, for the chloroquine-resistant strain, and over 5-fold, for the-sensitivestrain, in relation to compound ( 98) [125]. It is possible the di- hydrofuran ring might contribute to the conformational rigidityof the compound or its electron flow, augmenting its potentialantiprotozoal activity. In any case, without the SI, general toxicitycannot be overlooked, making these compounds unlikely futureantimalarials.Table 7 Lignans.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Discussion Phenolic compounds and their derivatives are found in virtually every plant, as part of their metabolic pathways, and, subse-quently, are a major component in both the diet and medicine ofthe populace. The complexity of plant extracts deters the phar- macokinetic studies and the prediction of clinical outcomes [12]. Therefore, it is logical to focus on the plants isolated compounds. However, individual molecules, or extracts, might not prove tohave a comparable efficacy in in vitro/vivo tests. Still, clinical value is not directly defined solely by these assays. The ability to betterfevers or anemia is highly valued by the patients, who often do nothave the capability of reaching out for professional help or to payfor the recommended treatments. Future traditional medicine ap- plications will require effectiveness validation and standardization into improved traditional medicines, as is recognized by the WorldHealth Organization [126]. As a result, although the cost may rise,these might still prove a preferential option to purified or synthe-sized drugs, with the added advantage that the process could bedeveloped locally, which would improve the accessibility of thesemedicines [10,12, 126,127]. In order to verify the safety of con-sumption and enable future medical applications but also to en- large the data pool of interesting antiplasmodial compounds, it isimportant to continue to screen and study traditional medicinal plants. To target malaria, the 6 most interesting sub-groups of phe- nolic compounds were condensed and will now be analyzed. Foran integral view of the MoA on the parasite, see Fig. 1 . Phenolic acids, phenols, and their derivatives conserve simple phenolic moieties and are, therefore, related to several MoA. They are capable of inhibiting hemoglobin digestion and hemozoin for- mation, disturbing the redox homeostasis and, possibly, iron che-lating [40, 49]. However broad their reach, no selected compoundfrom this class excels at differentiating themselves as antiplasmo-dials. In fact, the low bioavailability, rapid metabolization, andnon-consistent selectivity and activity toward all types of strainsrepresent important characteristics that prevent interest in thisclass of compounds [37,43, 47]. It is noteworthy to mention that in other classes of compounds, the galloyl or gallate moiety sub- stitution has shown to improve the compound s activity, as evi- denced throughout this review. Still, these structures show no rel-evant potential on their own [33,34]. In a similar fashion, no coumarin stands within the selected compounds. Overall, all present a wide-range of concentrationsthat are unreliable concerning the necessary characteristics of anantimalarial [22, 28]. The lack of studies regarding their MoA and selectivity also leaves an information void. Further studies would Fig. 7 Molecular structures of lignans. 608Mamede L et al.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. be necessary to confirm the contribution this class could give, es- pecially considering that there are coumarins identified as the ac-tive compounds of traditionally used plants [8, 51]. The flavonoid phytochemical class is one of the most extensive and varied classes approached in this review. Its structural varia-tion is great, and, as mentioned previously, the criteria of this re-view allowed the narrowing of the ideal characteristics of the ac-tive structures: flavone, biflavone, and biflavanone (see Fig. 9 ). Not only are there multiple molecules with considerable struc- ture-activity co-relation, but the known MoA by which they actare multiple [4, 55]. Of the 34 flavonoids presented, 3 are of interest: compound (11, 21 ,a n d 37). All are dimeric structures, a biflavone, and bifla- vanones. They demonstrate a good antiplasmodial activity againstboth multidrug-resistant and sensitive strains with a great SI [63, 66, 67, 128]. Compound ( 11) appears to have the ideal structure for FAS inhibition: a planar structure (double bond C-2-C-3) and hydroxy groups C-5 its B-ring doesnot possess hydroxy groups, it could be that the other character-istics are enough to represent antiplasmodial activity. Compounds(21and37) fall far from these characteristics, possibly justifying its activity through the number and position of the hydroxygroups [66, 67]. The most active catechins are the ones with a gal-loyl moiety at C-3, of which compound ( 50) is the most active of the presented [55,72]. Unfortunately, the range of concentra- tions needed for ( 50) to act as antiplasmodial could coincide with the therapeutic window of other activities, imposing care in itsutilization [72]. In this regard, flavonoids appear safer and moreactive, and, therefore, more promising to study as antimalarialsthan catechins. In the symptomatic phase of malaria, which is understood as the erythrocytic stage of the parasite s life cycle, the parasite has to maintain a relatively sensitive homeostasis. Particularly its re- dox homeostasis, since not only does its digestion of hemoglobinand the mitochondrial activity originate oxidative stress, but alsothe host s immune system attacks with ROS [129,130]. The host s erythrocyte is also receiving oxidative insults, which means theparasite must maintain both systems redox homeostasis if it wants to survive [43,129, 130]. In the fight to prevent lipid perox-idation, inactivation of enzymes and ion channels, protein oxida- tion and inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, the parasite is equipped with an antioxidant system includes glutathioneproteins and superoxide dismutase [43]. When antimalarials areable to saturate this system and disturb the already fragile redoxbalance, the cascade of oxidative damage ensures the parasite s death [130]. Flavonoids are recognized powerful antioxidantsthat, in certain conditions of concentration and the presence ofmetal ions, as occurs within the erythrocytic stage of the parasite, act as pro-oxidants. This disturbs this vital balance and leads to the parasite s death. Particularly the B-ring of flavonoids may be converted to a phenoxy (as semiquinones) under ex-treme stress [4, 45]. Flavonoids, and particularly green tea s catechins, remain the main group of phenolic compounds with evidenced antiFAS activ-ity [55, 63, 72]. Both mammal cells and the Plasmodium sp. use the FAS system to perform the elongation cycle of fatty acids. The structural differences between type I (eukaryote) and type IITable 8 Other phenolic compounds.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. (among others, protozoa) allow this essential system to be tar- geted by antimalarials [72]. Both the FAS system and a part ofthe protein synthesis occur in the apicoplast, where flavonoids in-teract with the pertinent enzymes and inhibit this pathway [55,72]. An ingenious MoA that was ultimately never implemented is iron chelating. Iron is essential for protozoa, among other infec-tious species, to thrive and is the main concern when invading a host [16]. Iron chelators induce death by iron-starvation, possibly preventing the use of iron on the mitochondria s respiratory chain or for DNA synthesis [16]. Overall, flavonoids represent an alter-native to conventional iron chelators that have unreasonable re-quirements of therapy time and dangerous secondary effects[78]. Flavonoids have the property to starve the parasite of iron,while not being as aggressive to the host as the known syntheticiron-chelators [54,75]. Additionally, and finally, an innovative, although relatively un- explored, antiplasmodial target is the inhibition of new permea-tion pathways. After 6 h post-invasion, the parasite alters the con-stitution of the host s cell membrane with its own proteins in or- der to make it permeable to more compounds [131]. Anions, butnot cations, and small compounds, like monosaccharides, become available to the parasite [120, 131,132].The homeostasis of the whole structure is again threatened, since the osmotic status and erythrocyte membrane potential might be altered. Flavonoids have the capability of inhibiting these perme-ations pathways, altering the metabolism of the parasite, leading to its death [120]. Hemolysis and immune recognition might bepart of the killing process [132]. The versatility and multiple approach capacity make flavonoids the most interesting class in this paper. They are highly activeagainst various strains of P. falciparum , with a SI of, overall, at least higher than 4. This represents their safety, also expressed by theexclusive and varied pathways through which they target the parasite alone. These compounds have prolonged half-lives and have an history of dietary importance, making them at least ap-parently safe for children and pregnant women [4, 63, 71]. Theirsolubility is enough to quench the long-sought requirement thatmost identified antiplasmodials cannot meet, not to mention itswide distribution, which should make these compounds low-costly. Their presence in traditional plants used against malaria inendemic places not only validates their use to a certain extent but evidences their viability as chosen promising compounds [4, 63, 71]. Lastly, although it depends on the chosen flavonoid, there isno reason to believe the compound could not be used in ACTs;proven activity tests are made to distinguish the ACT s MoA from the flavonoid s. The quinones and their derivatives presented and discussed have various structures; the most promising appear to be anthra-quinones and anthrones. The most interesting anthraquinone is compound ( 55), a knipholone derivative with a glucopyranoside that awards it an additional edge in both activity and selectivity Fig. 8 Molecular structures of other phenolic derivatives. 610Mamede L et al.

Likewise, compound ( 75) is the most interesting anthrone, a vismione with a geranyl group at C-7 and an acetyl group at C-2,attaining the same advantage [94]. It is noteworthy that, overall,the presented quinones all have high antiplasmodial potentials. Itis their SI that represents a liability in transforming these com-pounds into antimalarials. Both compounds ( 55and 75)m a y present structure-activity starting points toward a solution to thisproblem. Fig. 9 shows the ideal structures to be considered for further studies. Activity-wise, quinone structures can be oxidizedto semiquinones that function as Michael acceptors in nucleo-philic additions that establish covalent bonds with proteins, signif-icantly damaging the parasite [49, 99]. However, this might nothappen exclusively in the parasite, which is why the SI is not al- ways optimal. Naphthoquinones have high affinities to the cyto- Fig. 9 Projected ideal molecular structures per phytochemical class.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. chrome bc1complex within the parasite s mitochondria respirato- ry chain, a specific parasitic structure, justifying the SI of atova-quone and similar acting compounds [84]. However, as formerlydiscussed, parasites with resistance to atovaquone exist and havelimited its use. This represents an obstacle in the interest of devel- oping this class further, unless these new phenolic compounds could prove to bypass this resistance. Xanthones, as discussed previously, appear to be a particularly interesting class of antiplasmodials. They display somewhat apreference in activity toward chloroquine or multidrug-resistantstrains. How this happens may be unknown, but it certainly dem-onstrates an advantage against the resistant parasite. It is note-worthy that all the isolated xanthones originated in the same fam- ily, Clusiaceae, broadly distributed in tropical regions, similarly to malaria [93]. The most impactful characteristic toward activityand selectivity seems to be the prenylation at key carbons with2-methylpent-2-ene groups. A substitution with another group,as in compound ( 85), demonstrates great activity, but low selec- tivity, indicative of general toxicity [64,93, 111]. As mentioned inthe related section, not only do hydroxyl groups at positions C-3,C-6, and C-8 improve xanthones activity but also prenylations at C-1, C-4, and C-7 do as well (see Fig. 9 ). A good example of a promising xanthone would be compound ( 83), with a 20-fold preferential activity toward the chloroquine-resistant strain and agood SI [110]. Its cyclization at C-1-C 2 could be the responsible factor, acting in a similar fashion, or better, to the carbon chain atC-1. It is possible the improved lipophilia of the carbon chains fa-cilitates the entrance and accumulation of these compounds in-side the digestive vacuole, easing their antiplasmodial activity as inhibitors of the hemozoin formation [ 109,133]. Also, because the electrostatic potential of xanthones is directly related to theirantiplasmodial activity, an additional ring may complement an electrostatic profile that allows the interactions with hematin,preventing its transformation [108]. Lignans, according to the present findings, are comp ounds with high antiplasmodial potential and varied SI. Compound ( 94) is a very interesting lignan with an outstanding activity against a chloroquine-resistant strain and no toxicity against Hep G2 A16cells [117]. However, it is uncertain if lignans could be an innova-tive antimalarial structure, since most screened lignans are recog-nized for their general toxicity, unwarranted in malaria s case [117]. Additionally, their MoA is uncertain and would require fur-ther studies to ascertain the interest in this phytochemical class. It is pertinent to discuss, considering the topic of phenolic compounds, their antioxidant properties in the context of the ma- laria disease. Phenolic compounds are considered powerful anti-oxidants with the capacity to turn into powerful oxidants whencertain conditions are met, for example, their concentration. Theeasier the oxidation of the phenolic comp ound (i.e., the highest the phenoxyl radical/phenol redox ratio), the higher the antiplas-modial activity [4]. Studies have shown that the higher the oxida-tion potential of phenols, the higher the selectivity toward the parasite [106], which means phenolic compounds could be se- lected for their oxidation potential in order to improve their selec-tivity and, consequently, antiplasmodial activity. However, consid-ering that this potential depends on certain conditions, if the anti-oxidant potential overthrows the oxidant, the antiplasmodial ac-tivity might become compromised, begging the question if thistype of activity is reliable in the context of malaria [130]. Table 9gives an overview on the antioxidant potential of some of the discussed antiplasmodial phenolic compounds. Most compounds in this table are proton donors, as represented by their high anti-Table 9 The antioxidant activity of some phenolic compounds.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. oxidant values. Compounds ( 79) is an exception, an electron do- nor that can act as a nucleophile in Michael reactions [80]. Com-pound ( 89) is also a noteworthy exception, the weakest antioxi- dant of its study but also the most active antiplasmodial, evidenc-ing how xanthones have other MoA [114]. If antioxidants are everto be included in antimalarial therapy, all factors need to be takeninto consideration. The path that connects the discovery to the development of a new antimalarial is both expensive and time-consuming. A group of accepted criteria exists to help distinguish, as a pre-set, if acompound is promising enough to go on this journey. First, thecompound should be a potent antiplasmodial against both resist-ant and sensitive strains of P. falciparum in vitro .T h i sp r e s u p p o s e s that the compound targets an essential component to the para-site s survival, an unavoidable route or molecule [12,18]. Second, the compound must be selectively toxic to the parasite (i.e., it must use a unique target, divergent from the host) [12, 18]. This is represented by a high SI. Some authors argue above 4, othersabove 1000, while accepting that the SI depends on the strains and types of cells tested and it is only an indicative figure [12,18]. Third, the ability to eradicate murine malaria in in vivo models without any signs of toxicity has been highly suggestive of apromising compound [12, 18]. Fourth, because the ideal antima-larial is perceived as oral, it is advisable to select the compound with its bioavailability in mind [12, 18]. Other criteria might also be considered, such as a long half-life, no recrudescence, activeon gametocytes and hypnozoites, no adverse effects, appropriatefor pregnant women and children, inexpensive, a therapy no lon-ger than 3 days, and optimally a compound that could be includedin ACTs. These are a set of complicated, at times impossible,guidelines to follow for 1 single compound, which makes the de-velopment of antimalarials harder than it would appear [3,5, 134, 135]. In order to obtain information to be able to distinguish promis- ing from not-promising compounds, standard in vitro and in vivo assays are developed, but they possess limitations. The in vitro screening tests account only for the erythrocytic stage, responsi-ble for the disease as it is perceived, namely the fevers and itscomplications. Therefore, the test cannot detect compounds thatact in other stages of the Plasmodium sp. life cycle that would be equally important to target [7]. Even with the SI information, the compounds may still affect different human cells and organs,leading to unwanted effects. In spite of the restriction on interpre-tation of these tests, they remain the major mechanism throughwhich relevant data may be attained ethically. Unfortunately, thecost of the required apparatus and tests prevents most studies ofplants from having a complete profile. In order to define whethera compound could be a promising antimalarial, it is necessary to have a minimum battery of tests that give basic information, such as activity and toxicity, to indicate if in vivo tests, for example, would be worth doing. In this context, it is important to discuss the emergence of ar- tefacts during assays. It has been discussed that some classes ofcompounds may appear to be active in various screening tests,only to be discarded when, upon further studies, it is discoveredthat their activity is not specific [136]. These compounds -called Pan Assay INterference compoundS (PAINS) -are, in fact, reactivechemicals and not selective promising drugs (i.e., they interact generally with multiple proteins or enzymes, sometimes interfer-ing inclusively with the reading of the test) [136, 137]. This repre-sents a problem in drug discovery, since active componentsshould be selective and discriminant in what structures they inter-act with. Since most drugs derive from natural compounds, it isonly expected that some PAINS classes have structures that ap-pear in nature, as in the case of quinones and catechols [136 - 138]. In both cases, the issue is in their propensity to establish re- dox reactions, chelate metals, and become nucleophiles that in-terfere with multiple targets in a cell [137 -139]. As discussed pre- viously, these classes have uncertain MoA on the malaria parasite,thus their activity might be justified with these general processes.T e s t sw i t hc u r c u m i n( 5), epigallocatechin gallate ( 47), and qui- nones have revealed multiple ways in which they interfere withcells, such as connecting easily to proteins through thiol addition, chaperone inactivation, and alteration of intramembrane protein function through partition into the (eukaryote) cell membrane[99, 107,140]. In the antimalarial dis covery context, however, this issue becomes particular. The Plasmodium parasite is intracellular,which means all antimalarials must enter and, to a certain degree,interact with the host cell, the red blood cell. In vitro tests, thus, include both cell systems. Although results are usually re vealed through a method that correlates specifically to the parasite, it is undoubtably important to also perform other tests, lysis tests for example, to rule out direct toxicity to the red blood cells. Oncemore, the selectivity tests gain importance, allowing for the com-parison of IC 50on normal cells, which reveals the general toxicity compounds might have. This is the case with compounds ( 6and 78), a catechol and a quinone respectively, that reveal good activ- ity but also low SI, indicative precisely of no selectivity and, thus,no future applications in this respect. Lastly, it is important to note that, although researchers should be conscious that PAINS exist and might adulterate results, the presence of the molecular struc-ture should not be enough to abandon all interest in a compound[136, 139,141]. As mentioned previously, atovaquone is a syn-thetic derivative from lapachol, a quinone, with a described MoAand selective toward the Plasmodium sp., that is currently used in the drug Malarone. This demonstrates how the presence of thequinone moiety was successfully optimized to an approved drug and, likewise, other compounds might follow. In the same order of ideas, ellagic acid ( 3), exhibiting a catechol moiety, presents high in vitro activity on multiple strains, high SI, and also high in vivoactivity in a P. vinckei petteri model, which is not coherent with a nonspecific mode of action [37]. Hence, it represents a good ex-ample of how future optimization could lead to important find-ings. Concerning phenolic compounds, flavonoids and maybe xan- thones prove to be the most promising classes. Xanthones are in- teresting for their capability of bypassing the chloroquine resis-tance mechanisms, which per se might help to work around this issue. Whether it is its lipophilicity, electronic distribution, or skel-eton conformity, and if the structure could be applied to the qui-noline antimalarial class would be interesting subjects to explore. As a side note, attention should be given to the contradiction between the requirement of oral absorption and the evidence that increased lipophilia is a major factor toward antiplasmodial 613Mamede L et al.

Thus far, for most phenolic classes, lipophilia successfully improved the oxidant activity, the entry in the parasite and in itsdigestive vacuole, while also facilitating the compound s accumu- lation in the parasite s structures. Upon observing Fig. 9 ,i tb e - comes clear most ideal structures include additional rings or hy-drocarbon chains, which in turn diminishes the hydrophilia. Thispresents the importance of maintaining these characteristics infavor of greater antimalarial activities, and, in turn, considering other strategies to develop new drugs, (e.g., different administra- tion routes, different pharmaceutical formulations, or a pro-drug,such as artemisinin, which transforms in dihydroartemisinin, themetabolite that exerts antimalarial effect) [142]. The emergence of future antimalarials might be linked to the study of natural compounds, such as phenolic compounds. Thesecompounds present novel mechanisms to kill the malarial parasiteand even possible molecular keys to fight established resistances. However, a long way still lays ahead to take full advantage of these benefits. Unfortunately, some phytochemical classes remain un-described or understudied regarding their selectivity and MoA,leaving an incomplete profile to work with. Such is the case ofcoumarins and lignans, as evidenced in this paper. Furthermore,although the 3 most interesting classes -flavonoids, quinones, and xanthones -have available information on them, allowing in- clusively the eligibility of interesting compounds from these groups (compounds 11, 21, 37, 55, 75 ,a n d 83), it is evident that the incomplete data on some compounds may shift the under-standing of which ones are the most pertinent to pursue studies.It is essential to have a complete set of data, both the antiplasmo-dial activity, ideally on multiple strains, and the SI, to be able todiscuss compounds as closely as possible. Additionally, for thechosen compounds, in vivo testing remains essential to confirm their potential and should be performed, as part of a complete profile, whenever previous factors support them. Finally, the present review allowed, for the most interesting phytochemicalcompounds, to preview an ideal molecular structure in order tooptimize the antiplasmodial activity. It would be important to syn-thetize these compounds, test them, and assess further theirstructure-activity relation. Overall, this review demonstrates thevariety of possible future phenolic antimalarials and the potentialthat natural compounds hold in the fight against malaria.
