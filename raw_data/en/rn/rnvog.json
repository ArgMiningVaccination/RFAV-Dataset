Chandola, as part of Prof. M.S. Baghel Memorial Lecture Series on 09th April 2021.The video lecture can be accessed on the link of [facebook page.](https://fb.watch/8l8TUYT2eZ/) Introduction In the present era, the world is changing focus on \"preservation of health\" rather than treating the diseases. New diseases are emerging day by day in new forms. It is high time to recognize the importance of boosting up the defense mechanism of the body. This helps to resist any kind of adverse circumstances and maintain the proper balance of all the components of health. Acharya Sushruta's definition of a \"healthy person\" (swastha) is the most widely accepted one in [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda).[Su. Sa. Sutra Sthana 15/41] The physical components of health are listed as the three [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) - ( [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata), [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) and [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha)); the excretory functions( [mala](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mala)). Digestive power ( [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)) is also added with due importance. It indicates that all kinds of \"transformation processes\", essential for the maintenance of health are facilitated by the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) from gross to minute level. Apart from physical health, the pleasant state and harmony of sensual faculties ( [indriya](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Indriya)), mind ( [manas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Manas)) as well as spiritual awareness ( [atma](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Atma)) are also the essential criteria for health. All these components are interrelated and can affect each other's state of well-being. E.g: mental disturbances or negative emotions can disturb the proper function of digestive power and vice versa. If a person is worried, sad, angry, or emotionally upset, even the wholesome food consumed in proper quantity will not get digested properly.[Cha. Sa. [Vimana Sthana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vimana_Sthana) 2/9] Three categories of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) Good health begins in the gut. While explaining the concept of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni), the main form of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) is called as the \"jatharagni\" (pachakagni) which refers to the digestive enzymes. There are five elemental enzymes (bhutagni) which are the micro-elemental converters, and also the seven corresponding tissue building enzymes (dhatwagni). The digestive enzymes (pachakagni) control the other two kinds of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) that are acting at the level of absorption and metabolism. The term \"koshthagni\" is used when it deals with the digestive process in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Agni and patterns of digestion When the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) is in the balanced state, it is known as \"samagni\". But when it is affected by three [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha), it shows three pathological variations. If there is an excess of [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha), it lowers the power of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) and the condition is known as \"mandagni\" (slow digestion). When [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) is in excess form, the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) becomes \"teekshnagni\" (fast/quick digestion). It can digest anything and everything and when the food is not available, it starts digesting the tissue elements ( [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu)). For example, in thyrotoxicosis the hyperactivity of the thyroid gland causes high basic metabolic rate (BMR) and cachexia develops. When the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) is affected by vitiated [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata), it becomes \"vishamagni\" (irregular digestion). As [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) has catalytic action (\"yogavahi\"), if it interacts with [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha), it will enhance the activity of [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) and if it interacts with [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta), it enhances the activities of [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta). Ultimately, the impairment of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) leads to improper digestion leading to the process of fermentation and putrefaction, and then, there is the production of toxic metabolites called \"ama\". These toxic metabolites are the main cause of all the disease conditions. All diseases arise from the lowered activity of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni).i.e \"mandagni\" [A.Hr. Chikitsa Sthana 12/1]. So, good or bad health begins in the gut and the treatment is focused on the measures for maintaining the health of digestive power (kayagni), thereby eliminating all the diseases of the whole body. This is the first branch of Ayurveda called \"Kayachikitsa'. The concept of digestion in Ayurveda The whole digestive process in the gut starts right from the mouth, where there is the action of \"bodhaka [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha)\" to start the process of digestion. Then it goes to the stomach (amashaya) where it is subjected to the action of \"kledaka [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha)\" for adding the moisture content (kleda) to the food material. Subsequently, from the stomach (amashaya) it goes into the portion of the small intestine called \"grahani\" which is the seat of \"pachaka [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta)\". The 6th internal layer called \"pittadhara kala\" is also situated there. The main process of digestion occurs in this portion of the gut. It is followed by caecum (unduka) and large intestine (pakwashaya) where the separation of essence (sara) and excretory materials (kitta) occurs with the help of \"samana [vayu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vayu)\" which leads to the absorption and assimilation of nutrient portion and excretion of the waste products in the form of faeces ( [purisha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Purisha)) and urine ( [mutra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mutra)) \"apana [vayu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vayu)\". Here, the \"kledaka [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha)\" can be represented in the form of mucin, which moistens the food materials and loosens its molecules. It buffers the action of the strong acid and inhibits the action of pepsin. It provides a protective layer to the stomach wall to prevent the corrosive effect and its digestion by pepsin. So, the functions of \"kledaka [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha)\" are reflected mainly through the functions of mucin. The action of kledaka [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) is also executed by the following secretions in the gut. - Serous & mucous secretions glands & mucous glands of surface mucous cells and mucous neck cells of the stomach. - Mucous and bicarbonate ions secreted from duct of pancreas. secreted by goblet cells that lubricate the intestinal surface. - Water & electrolytes secreted by enterocytes of the small intestine. - Mucous secreted by epithelial cells of crypt's of Liberkuhn of the large intestine. \"Pachaka It digests the food, separates the waste and nutrients from it, and supports the other forms of [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) located in different parts of the body. The third most important component of the digestive process is \"samana [vayu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vayu)\" which represents the regulation of the enteric nervous system, the sympathetic and parasympathetic supply of the autonomic nervous system. The action of \"samana [vayu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vayu)\" can be partially understood by the regulation of the secretion of HCL by parietal cells. The activities of the vagus nerve, the amount of gastrin from G cells and somatostatin from D cells, and the level of histamine play a vital role in this process. Acid-Peptic Diseases Acid peptic disorders include many conditions whose pathophysiology is directly related to the damage caused by acid and peptic activity of gastric secretions. It includes gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer (gastric and duodenal), and stress-related mucosal injury. In all these conditions, mucosal erosions or ulcerations arise when the caustic effects of aggressive factors overwhelm the defensive factors of the gastrointestinal mucosa. Aggressive and defensive Factors Here, the aggressive factors represent the acid, pepsin, bile salts, drugs (NSAIDs), and H. pylori and the defensive factors are represented by mucus, bicarbonate layer, proper blood flow, cell renewal prostaglandins, and phospholipids. So, the therapy is directed at enhancing host defence or eliminating aggressive factors including Helicobacter pylori. In short, the imbalance between aggressive factors (pachaka [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta)) and defensive factors (kledaka [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha)) leads to acid peptic diseases. Vitiation of Agni (Agni dushti) and Acid peptic disorders For maintaining health, [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) should be in its balanced state, i.e. \"samagni\". All other states of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) leads to acid peptic disorders. Improper dietary habits cause vitiation of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni), which leads to the process of fermentation of food material and ultimately it forms the toxic material called \"amavisha\". It leads to \"indigestion\" (ajeerna) by vitiating the [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha). Continuous indulgence in improper diet and erratic lifestyle aggravates [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha). This leads to an acute condition of \"vidagdhajirna\". This is converted into different acid-peptic disorders like Amlapitta The clinical diagnosis of \"vidagdhajeerna\" is based on the symptoms like sour eructation, burning sensation, giddiness, thirst, and sweating. In case of \"amlapitta\", the symptoms are indigestion, nausea, sour/bitter eructation, burning sensation in oesophagus, epigastric region, anorexia, and abdominal heaviness. Many of the clinical researches on \"amlapitta\" had revealed that hyperacidity might not be an essential finding in all the patients with the symptoms of \"amlapitta\". Many of them can be normosecretors. Some may be hyper secretors as in the case of \"hyperchlorhydria\" and some may even be hypo-secretors as in the case of hypochlorhydria. For proper digestion, an appropriate pH is essential which is usually acidic in the stomach. A delayed gastric emptying time leads to fermentation of food, producing organic acids as seen in conditions like gastroparesis (alasaka - vilambika), whereas rapid gastric emptying acidifies the medium of gut. These states are seen in \"amlapitta\" and related diseases. Here, mucosal resistance is very important. The abnormal acid medium erodes the mucous lining of the concerned segment of the gut leading to painful conditions of the upper abdomen like gastric ulcer (annadrava shula) and duodenal ulcer (parinama shula). So, where aggressive factors are dominant, like in hyper-secretors, it leads to duodenal ulcer (parinama shula). Where there is the weakness of defensive factors, like in hypo-secretors or normo-secretors, it leads to the gastric ulcer (annadrava shula). So, it is better to consider amlapitta as a syndrome (acid reflux syndrome) rather than a particular gastrointestinal disease. It closely resembles gastritis, non-ulcer dyspepsia, hyperchlorhydria as well as hypochlorhydria and in the chronic stage, it may lead to gastric ulcer. Gastritis Gastritis is a clinical condition with upper abdominal discomfort like indigestion or dyspepsia in which specific clinical signs or radiological abnormalities are absent. It is of two types- acute gastritis and chronic gastritis. Acute gastritis For acute gastritis, there are many causative factors including diet and personal habits like consumption of highly spiced food, excessive alcohol consumption, heavy smoking, infections like H. Pylori, viral hepatitis, drugs like NSAIDs, aspirin, chemotherapeutic agents, severe stress including emotional factors like anger, shock, resentment, trauma, surgery and excessive burn. Due to these stress factors and smoking habits, the tracheobronchial tree of the person becomes hypersensitive and there will be increased secretion of acetylcholine, catecholamines, and histamine. This leads to hypersecretion HCL from parietal cells due to hyperstimulation of vagus and increased secretion of gastrin. It makes the person more prone to acid peptic disorders. It is better to take advantage of recent technologies for finding out the exact cause of the condition. If the conventional Ayurvedic treatment is not giving the desired result, we should explore the other possibilities like H.pylori infection and treat accordingly. Principles of treatment in acute gastritis - The related organ, stomach (amashaya) should be given due importance. ( amashaya vishesha chikitsa) - Drugs that reduce the penetrating power (tikshnatva) and fluidity (dravatva) of [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta)i.e, drugs having a bitter taste (tikta rasa) and dry (ruksha) nature should be used to counteract these properties respectively. - Improving the quality of digestive power ( [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)deepana) - Mild churna are effective medicines in this condition. - It is better to avoid fermented preparations (asava & arishta) Chronic gastritis Recurrent attacks of acute gastritis may result in chronic gastritis. It is classified into, - Type A gastritis (Autoimmune gastritis) - Type B gastritis (H. Pylori related) - Type AB gastritis (Mixed gastritis, environmental gastritis, chronic atrophic gastritis) Type A gastritis - Auto immune gastritis It mainly involves the body-fundic mucosa and is called autoimmune gastritis and is usually associated with other autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Addison's disease. Antibodies against parietal cells and intrinsic factor cause depletion of parietal cells and this leads to the impaired secretion of intrinsic factors. Ultimately, these changes may lead to significant gastric atrophy. Type B gastritis (H. Pylori infection) It mainly involves the region of antral mucosa and is the common type. It is also called hypersecretory gastritis because of excessive secretion of acid due to H. Pylori infection. It is usually associated with peptic ulcer. Type A B gastritis (Mixed / Environmental / Chronic atrophic gastritis) It affects the mucosal region of the body of the stomach-both fundic and antral parts. It is the most common type of gastritis affecting all age groups. It is also called environmental gastritis because a number of unidentified environmental factors have been implicated in etiopathogenesis. In its advanced stage, there is progression from chronic superficial gastritis to chronic atrophic gastritis characterized by mucosal atrophy and metaplasia of intestinal or pseudopyrloric type. Principle of treatment of chronic gastritis For treating the chronic gastritis, the principle of treatment of \" [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata)- [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) dominant gulma\" is recommended. It includes protecting the [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha), which is the defensive factor. Here, the measures to reduce the penetrating power (tikshnatva) of [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) should be administered, followed by healing or soothing type of medicines (ropana chikitsa). The emblica (amalaki) with ghee and honey is best for healing action. Drugs with bitter (tikta) or sweet (madhura) tastes (rasa) are preferable here. Ghee or milk preparation processed with these kind of drugs are also advisable. The psychological component should also be addressed with equal importance because stress plays an important role in this condition. If a person's mental status is not positive, it may lead to indigestion. In the second line of treatment, mild purgation therapy (mrudu [virechana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Virechana)) can be given. It is better to avoid the ready-made decoctions (kashayas) in bottles because the preservatives added to them can worsen the condition. Medicated ghee preparations are better to be prescribed. Formulations this condition. Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) Due to decreased tone of lower oesophageal sphincter, the gastric contents get regurgitated frequently into the oesophagus. It causes damage to the mucous membrane of oesophagus and lead to esophagitis.The risk factors for this condition include obesity, fat-rich diet, caffeine, alcohol, smoking, and the symptoms are heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia. It can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms, 24 hour pH monitoring, endoscopy, and biopsy. Line of treatment of GERD: and \"Vata are the principles to be followed. As vitiated [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) is responsible for the opposite (upward) movement of gastric contents, measures to pacify [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) and establish its natural downward movement (vatanulomana) is to be administered. Drugs that alleviate [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) and [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha), that dries up the moisture content (kledahara), and have a bitter taste (tikta rasa) predominantly are used here. As the second line of treatment, drugs having a sweet taste (madhura rasa) are also prescribed. In this condition, mild therapeutic (sadyo [vamana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vamana)), mild milk (kshira [basti](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Basti)) are also recommended. It is better to (ghrita kalpana) like dadimadi ghrita , mahatiktaka ghrita, etc. should be prescribed for rasa are very effectively used in this condition. The main thing is the modification of dietary and personal habits. It is better to avoid hot and spicy foods, excessive use of pungent, sour, and salty food, fried items, curd, mustard, and sour fruits in the diet. It is recommended to avoid alcohol consumption, smoking, and regular intake of coffee. Peptic ulcer It includes both gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer formed due to the imbalance of aggressive factor and defensive factor as discussed earlier. Eating worsens the symptoms of gastric ulcer and improves the symptoms of duodenal ulcer. Hunger pain is observed in duodenal ulcer. The diagnosis is based on endoscopy. For detection of H. pylori, \"rapid urease test\" or \"clo test\" is performed. Biopsy is done to exclude possibility of cancer. In the management, high dose of proton pump inhibitors is given in conventional medicine. Gastric ulcer (annadrava shula) In this condition, there is continuous severe pain not subsiding in any stages of digestion like after digestion or during digestion, whether at empty stomach or after taking food. It is relieved only after vomiting out the accumulated [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta). mixed and blocked by morbid [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) and [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha). It causes severe pain (shula), which known as \"parinama shula\". Excess [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha)) of the duodenum. The mucous layer sheds from its place and gets admixed with [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) (acids). Since the mucous layer forms a buffer and protective sheath of the intestines, shedding of the mucous membrane (kapha) leads to the formation of ulcers or sores in the intestinal mucosal walls. This is the stage of ulcer formation. The [vayu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vayu) gets aggravated and causes severe pain. This may be correlated with the irritation of nerve fibers at the region of sores. When the acidic food from the stomach enters the duodenum for further digestion, it corrodes and irritates the sores causing severe pain during the process of digestion. The pain remains until the acidic food is pushed forward from the duodenum or until the afflicted person consumes food. In [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) predominant type of duodenal ulcer, abdominal distension, gurgling sound, and non-passage of stool and urine are the main symptoms. It is relieved by the use of unctuous and hot substances. In [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) predominant type, there is excessive thirst, burning sensation, restlessness, and sweating. It is aggravated by the use of a spicy, sour, and salty diet. The pain is relieved by the use of cold articles. In [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) predominant type, vomiting, nausea, disorientation are the main symptoms. Mild pain persists for a long time and relieved by pungent and bitter foods. In case of peptic ulcer, rice, bean, salt, sour food articles, and condiments should be avoided. Milk, banana, and coconut water are advisable. Principles of treatment of peptic ulcer As the first line of treatment, drugs having predominantly bitter taste (tikta rasa) and inducing dryness(ruksha) are used. In the second phase, drugs with sweet taste (madhura rasa) and bitter taste(tikta rasa), and medicated milk preparations are used. In the last phase, medicated milk processed with drugs having sweet and bitter tastes is preferred. It is added with mental-health promoting (medhya) drugs. Avoiding the causative factor is the most important step in treatment. Mild purgation, enema with medicated milk (kshira [basti](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Basti)), pouring of medicated buttermilk on the forehead (takradhara), and anointment of medicated paste on forehead or scalp (shirolepa) are effective procedures in this condition. In a research work on duodenal ulcer(parinama shula) by Antony Jose & H.M.Chandola(2004), a It showed better results than administering only Akshadi churna. Significant difference was observed in the parameters of Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale. This shows the importance of dealing with the psychic component in this disease. Inflammatory bowel Diseases (IBD) This includes two idiopathic bowel diseases having many similarities but distinctive morphological appearance. a) Crohn's disease (regional enteritis) It affects the segment of terminal ileum and/ or colon, though any part of the gut may get involved. b) Ulcerative colitis It is the acute and chronic ulcero-inflammatory colitis affecting chiefly the mucosa and submucosa of the rectum and descending colon. Sometimes it may involve the entire length of the large bowel. The etiological factors of IBD include genetic factors, immunologic factors, microbial factors, and environmental factors like long-term administration of NSAIDs, psychological factors, smoking, oral contraceptive pills etc. In a genetically predisposed individual, the effect of environmental factors and deranged microbiota, result in dysregulation of mucosal and immune function, which leads to chronic inflammation. It is diagnosed using endoscopy with tissue biopsy, colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy etc. Symptoms like the elimination of faecal matter mixed with blood and mucous, having offensive smell are observed with weight loss in patients.These conditions are mentioned in the contexts of raktatisara, tridoshaja atisara and shokaja atisara. These symptoms are similar to IBD. Principle of treatment for ulcerative colitis The treatment protocols anthelminthic (krimighna) treatments are preferred in cases of ulcerative colitis. Drugs having bitter (tikta) or sweet (madhura) taste, with healing (ropana) property, in the form of medicated milk are recommended here. In the chronic stage, and if there is excessive blood loss, weight loss, the treatment for anaemia (pandu) and emaciation (dhatukshaya) also should kutajarishta, madhukasava, mustakarishta etc. are effective in this condition. However, fermented preparations should not be prescribed in the bleeding phase. Medicines in the powder (churna) form namely like jatiphaladi gutika and bilvadi gutika are also prescribed. mahatiktaka ghrita and shatavari ghrita are effective. Buttermilk is a very good remedy to treat this condition. The formulation panchamrita parpati along with butter milk gives excellent relief when administered orally or per rectal route. The other preparations used for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Medicated milk kshira) is especially preferred for consumption. The medicated enema called \"pichcha [basti](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Basti)\" is observed as very effective in this condition. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) IBS is a psychosomatic intestinal motility disorder presenting as altered bowel habits, abdominal pain, and the absence of detectable organic pathology. Altered bowel habits, i.e. frequent constipation and diarrhea or any one of these two symptoms is observed as the main characteristic feature. In Ayurvedic parlance, it can be interpreted under the following clinical conditions. a. Atisara [Cha. Sa. [Chikitsa Sthana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana) 19, Su. Among these conditions, symptoms of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) predominant [grahani](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Grahani) show more resemblance with IBS. Poor digestion, hyperacidity, roughness in the body and flatulence during and after digestion are observed in this condition. The patient frequently passes stool with difficulty. The consistency of faecal matter is liquid mixed with hard stool, associated with sound and frothiness. [Cha. Sa. [Chikitsa Sthana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana)15/6-10] In pravahika, there is frequent expulsion of stool containing mucus in less quantity accompanied by pain and straining (tenesmus). Dietary modifications including more dietary fibers, psycho-social therapies, drugs like anticholinergics, antidepressants, antidiarrheals, anxiolytics and those acting on serotonin receptors are being used in the management of IBS. Probiotics have a greater role to enhance or support the bacterial flora in the gut. Principles of treatment of IBS The treatment principles of vataja grahani, atisara and pakwashayagata [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) are used in the management of IBS. The psychological health component is taken care of by therapies like the pouring of liquid medicines like oil, medicated butter milk etc on the forehead (shirodhara/ takradhara) and anointment of medicated paste on scalp(shirolepa). Sitz bath with lukewarm medicated water(avagaha sweda), enema using medicated oil or ghee(anuvasana [basti](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Basti)) are effective procedures in this condition. The treatment principles can be divided into two as per the stages or phases: a)In Diarrhoea dominant stage, drugs having the properties of enhancing digestive power ( [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) dipana), styptic (grahi), and improving the strength of tissues (dhatubalakara) are used. b)In Constipation dominant stage, drugs that produce the effects of clearing the minute channels (srotoshodhana), enhancing the digestive power (koshthagnidipana), and promoting the downward movement of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) (vatanulomana) are used. In the first phase of IBS, mainly medicines in the powder (churna) form or medicated liquids (paneeya kalpana) are used to promote digestive power. In diarrhoea dominant stage, \"panchakola churna\" and in constipation dominant stage, \" vaishwanara churna\" are the drugs of choice. In the second phase, if the person acquires good digestive capacity( [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) dipti),medicated ghee (ghritas) and linctus preparation (avaleha) are used.These medicines pacify [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata)(vatahara) and help to maintain the proper function of digestive fire( [agnisatmyakara](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)). For example, dadimadi ghrita or sukumara ghrita mixed with rock salt(saindhava) milk and medicated meat soups are also effective in this condition. The dietary items like wheat, maize, barley, peas, black gram, soya bean, kidney bean, potato, sweet potato, onion, ground nut, chilly, oily food, chicken, red meat, crabs, mango, pineapple, apple, watermelon, cashew, fig, pumpkin papaya and jackfruit shall be avoided by the patients of IBS. The diet plan including the use of old rice, gourd, coriander leaves, lentil, green grams soup, black pepper, dried ginger, pomegranate, nutmeg buttermilk, and hot water are suitable. In a clinical study on IBS, by Raksha Mer & H. M. Chandola (2004), the effect of kutajadi avaleha alone and kutajadi avaleha along with medhyarasayana ghrita was compared.
