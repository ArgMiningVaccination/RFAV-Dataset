In the 1990s, advancements in automation (High -Throughput Screening) and isolation technologies resulted in the surge in research on natural products bo th in t he field of human health and agriculture . These strategies and techniques generated a substantial shift towards this 'green Eldorado ,' a real 'Green Rush' between 1990 and 2000. However, in the early 2000s most of the big Pharmas terminated their HTS and bioprospecting endeavours but to date, the low productivity of combichem and rational drug design is silently positioning pharmacognosy back on the rails and natural product discovery is remerging as a reputable source of current drugs on the ma rket. - 2 - Meanw hile, t he World Health Organization (WHO) has come to the realisation of the importance of biodiversity which would be able to offer affordable, therapeutic solutions to the majority of the world population. The preservation of the world's biodiversity and its access is a critical issue which could hamper a serene utilisation of natural pr oducts in the developing world with herbal -based phytopharmaceuticals representing a significant share of the total world pharmaceutical market . This review presents an industrial perspective discussing natural product drug discovery, lead research, botanicals, pro -drugs, synergy effects, drugs interactions with botanicals, traditional medicines, reverse pharmacognosy and presents the difficulties in accessing biodiversity. Keywords : Drug discovery, high -throughput screening (HTS), biodiversity, pharmaceutical industry, Access and Benefit Sharing . Introduction Natural products (NPs) , commonly referred to as 'secondary metabolites ' (the end -products of gene -expression) are an essential, reputable source of successful drug leads which originate from Earth's bio-diver se flora and fauna . Since more than 95% of the world's biodiversity has not been evaluated (known biodiversity is estimated at 2 million species of plants, ani mals, fungi and micro -organisms and alike) for any biological activity , the challenge is how to efficiently and effectively access and valorise this natural chemical diversity (Colegate and Molyneux ; Dewick 2009; Mis hra and Tiwari 2011) . Undoubtedly, natural products have been produced, as a result of millions of years of evolution of terrestrial and marine organisms adapting to various abiotic and biotic stresses. They are therefore encoded to be bioactive, for ages they have been used as medicines and t oday, they continue to be a reservoir of potential drugs (Lamottke et al. 2011) . The oldest records for the usage of medicinal plants dates back to 2400 B.C. on clay tablets (Mesopotamia) , (Attinger 2008) 1534 B.C. ; the Ebers Papyrus (9th year of Amenhotep 1 reign), and the Chinese Materia Medica , documen t written by Li (Zheng 1988) . From, ~300 B.C. (Theophrastus) who dealt with medicinal herbs to the isolation of morphine around 1804 by Sert\u00fcrner (Sert\u00fcrner 1817) , NPs have been the forefront of medicine to treat human disease (Dias et al. 2012) . With the advanc ements in the field of chemistry at the dawn of the 19th century, plants were examined vigilantly to fathom their therapeutic potential (Beutler 2009) . Historically, apothecaries and then pharmaceutical companies utiliz ed plant extracts to produce relatively crude therapeutic formulations . In the mid -20th century, drug formulatio ns of partly purified NPs became typical - 3 - prior to single molecule medicines (Mishra and Tiwari 2011) . Following the discovery of the well -known antibiotic, penicillin (1) (Figure 1) , many drug breakthroughs from microbial sources occurred and with the advances in diving techniques (improved SCUBA technologies) in the 1970s , subsequently opened the ocean as an overlooked source of NPs (Blunt et al. 2011) . Chemical synthesis, shifted the focus of drug discovery efforts from nature to the lab oratory bench in the late 1980s (Cragg and Newman 2013) . Of the 1135 new drugs approved from 1981 -2010, 50% were of NP origin ( natural, derivatives and analogues ) (Cragg 2007; Schmitt et al. 2011; Newman and Cragg 2012) with most of the chemical diversity nearly or completely absent from current small molecule -based screening libraries provided by combichem (Bauer et al. 2010) . Well known examples include the widely used breast cancer drug , paclitaxel (2) (Taxol\u00ae), isolated from the bark of the Pacific Yew, Taxus brevifolia (Dewick 2009) and trabectedin (3) (Yondelis\u00ae) isolate d from the sea squirt, Ecteinascidia turbinata (currently completing Phase III studies in the US) (Cuevas and Francesch 2009; Cragg and Newman 2013) which provide d the first marine anticancer drug to be approved in Europe after cytarabine (4) (1969) (Mayer et al. 2010) . Mevastatin (5) produced by Penicillium citrinum led to synthetic statins exemplified by atorvastatin (6) which is the best-selling block buster drug in Ph arma history. Statins wh ich lower cholesterol levels are frequently used as \"everyday medication\" (Verpoorte et al. 2005) and in some countries there is a shift towards purchasing this kind of medicine without prescription . Several other NPs or NP-derived drugs (oligopeptide) and ixabepilone (9) (epothilone derivative) are other example s of current FDA approved drugs (Data available at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov ). In this review we wish to discuss new trends, the future of natural products (as single -molecule entities and botanical extracts) from a Pharmaceutical Industry perspective . Cragg and Newman have extensively reviewed NPs, semi -synthetic NPs and nature inspired molecules which are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Cragg et al. 1997; Newman et al. 2003; Newman and Cragg 2007; Newman 2008; Cragg and Newman 2013) . In a recent review , Newman and Cragg have shown that 34 % of current drugs (where N = unmodified NP, 6 %; NB = a NP botanical and ND = a modified NP, 28 %) are NP inspired or derived. Sixty -six percent (where S*/N = a synthetic compound with a NP pharmacophore, 11 %; S* = a synthetic compound with a NP pharmacophore, 5 %; S/NM = a synthet ic compound showing competitive inhibition of the natural product substrate, 14 % and S = a synthetic compound with no natural product conception, 36 %) of NPs, NP inspired in the form of semi -synthetic/modified drug are the basis of current drugs on the m arket (Cragg and Newman 2013) . In a study by Koehn and co -authors , they examined the worldwide patent trends between 1984 -2003 in NP discovery (Koehn and Carter 2005) . - 4 - According to the authors statistics, there was a period of increasing patent activity through the 1980s (as the investigation of NPs as sources of drugs reached its peak in the Western pharmaceutical industr y), a slight decline fr om 1990 to 1999 and an increase in activity between 2000 -2003 (Koehn and Carter 2005) . Certainly, there are numerous NPs that have been patented however patenting would be required prior to p ublication and potential usage. [Insert Figure 1 Here] NP research at the industry level Worldwide pharmaceutic al R&D spending, increased from US $10 billion to US $30 billion over the same period, however the overall trend in the 1990s showed a gradual decline (Koehn and Carter 2005) . In a study by Butler and co -workers they documented that 34 NP-based drugs were launched between 1998 -2007, (Butler 2005; McWilliams 2006) with 6 of them based on lead compounds from plants or marine macro-organisms . Thirty -six plant -derived compounds and 10 marine -derived compounds were in oncology clinical trial s which were derivatives of 31 different lead NPs. However , in the last 25 years , of the 877 novel medicines developed between 1981 and 2002, 6 % were NPs and 27 % were NP derivatives indicating that they play an important source of no vel leads for the production of therapeutic drugs (Newman et al. 2003; Yuliana et al. 2011) . A different set of statistics was provided by Harvey and co-authors , which include data on drugs based on NPs from preclinical deve lopment through to pre-registration. One-hundred a nd eight plant -derived compounds, 24 animal (primarily marine) compounds, and 61 semisynthetic compounds out of 225 NPs were in development (Harvey 2008; Kingston 2011) . A total of 26 plant -based drugs were approved/launched during 200 0-2006 (Saklani and Kutty 2008) . Even though there are numerous examples of NPs that have reached the market, NP extracts (botanicals or phyto -pharmaceutical s) also play an essential role in therapy (examples will be discussed later in this review ). The current market is expanding as we are now seeking natural, traditional medicines which are available at relative low costs (Lawson 2013) . Botani cal therapeutics can be sold in the form of dietary supplements, drugs, or botanical drugs (Schmidt et al. 2008) and can eventually hold the status of current registered pharmaceuticals through regulatory offices such as the FDA if they surpass clinical trials and demonstrate efficacy and safety . - 5 - Why did many of Big Pharma's terminate their natural product programs? There are evidence s to suggest that there has been a significant decrease in the number of approved drugs by the FDA over the last 2 0 years (originally 45 approved in 1990 to 21 in 2010 ) (Kingston 2011) . To date, pharmaceutical companies are under scrutiny due to the gradual decline and pressure to increase the number of new drugs on the market , and as a result in the last decade, many pharmaceutical compa nies have abandoned their natural product drug discovery programs (Table 1 ) (Dickson and Gagnon 2004; McChesney et al. 2007) . Reasons for this included: lead compounds are available only in extremely small quantities, difficulties in sourcing/harvesting samples , extensive synthetic routes and development times resulting in poor yields, impracticality of scale -up, difficulties in the isolation and/or purification procedures, high toxicity of the active compound , ecological and legal considerations, government policies, lack of infrastructure and insufficient capital investment (Paterson an d Anderson 2005; Bhatnagar and Se -Kwon 2010; Lamottke et al. 2011; Thomas and Johannes 2011) . Companies including, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline gradually terminated or no longer maintain ed their screening program s whilst others, such a s Novartis have continued their programs . Most NP discovery programs are confined to academic research within universities and start -ups (Ortholand and Ga nesan 2004; Beutler 2009) mainly focusing on microorganisms (Sheridan 2012). The list of such companies is quoted by Sheridan. Though there are some well -known examples of NP derived compounds which have made it through the arduous drug discovery process it is important to mention those that have failed. Rifalazil (10) was evaluated by ActivBiotics, and failed in a Phase III trial for the treatment of the intermittent claudication associated w ith peripheral arterial disease (Mishra and Tiwari 2011) . Contulakin G (11) (marine cone snail) was an orphan drug designated lead of Cogn etix that ha d completed Phase Ib clinical trial s agains t chronic and intractable pain s but was placed on hold until further funding was made available (Mishra and Tiwari 2011) . In January 2005 a defibrinogenating agent extracted from the Malayan pit viper venom (used for many years in Germany as for deep vein thrombo sis and embolism) was fast-tracked for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. However, Neurobiological Technologies evaluated Viprinex \u00ae in Phase III clinical trials and it failed to show benefits in patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke ; in Januar y 2009 the Viprinex \u00ae program was terminated. Almost h alf of the existing pharmaceuticals today are i nspired by NPs and in our opinion, this trend will continue with a substantial amoun t of NP derived (leads or extracts) which will successfully reach the market in the future (Lamottke et al. 2011) . Miller an co -authors stated , that if it is assumed that 60,000 species of plants have been screened to yield the 13 5 known drugs (at the time) , then the 240,000 -290,000 (or even a - 6 - higher figure, to date) the remaining plant species could be expected to yield 540 to 653 new drug candidates (Farnsworth 1990; Newman et al. 2003) . In reality, though 60,000 may have been included in screening programs, most were evaluated against a limited number of disease targets, so many of the 60,000 plant specie s may still have some chance of yielding additional discoveries (Miller 2011) . In addition to their role as drugs, NPs are frequently used as molecular probes to identify disease relevant targets and this aspect also justifies pursuing NP research at the industry level (Schmitt et al. 2011) . Current status of natural product (NP) researc h Botanicals (Medicinal Plants and Herbs) - Potential sources of medicine Herbal phytopharmaceuticals which have reached US $60 billion, with annual growth rates of 5% to 15% represent a significant share of the total world pharmaceutical market (Naoghare and Song 2010) . The current increase may be due to the interest of phytopharmaceuticals in psychosomatic, metabolic and minor disorders. To some people, synthetic drugs cause harmful side effects and are expensive to purchase in comparison with traditional herbal products, even if \"natural\" is not always correlated with \"harmlessness.\" They have been widely used as medicines, dietary products, and nutritional supplements since ancient times. Herbal medicines are rich in bioactives that are beneficial for human health. Modern and herbal medicine s are not actually divergent to one another since more than 50% of currently marketed drugs are more or less derived from Earth's biodiversity (Newman and Cr agg 2012; Cragg and Newman 2013) . Medicinal plants or herbs thereof are essential for more than 70 % of the world's population that do not have access to Western medicine , therefore traditional medicine is highly recommended by the WHO . This was endorsed in the 2008 'Beijing declaration' http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/congress/beijing_declaration/en . Traditional medicine is particularly well suited to local conditions and represents an initiative for the future of health in developing countries even if the vast majority of physicians have limited understanding of the bioactive molecule s present in the extracts . Some countries like China , India, German y still teach phytotherapy in medical schools and practice herbal medicine . Botanicals could also be a solution for industrialised countries facing dramatic increases in health costs due to 'single molecule ' medicine . It is estimated that around 140,000 + Australians are admitted to hospital every year because of problems associated with iatrogenic side effects of Western single molecule medicines (Mackay 1998) . Natural products found in medicinal plants can efficiently mitigate the side effects of serious illne sses, f or example, plants can alleviate the effects of onco -chemotherapy or radiotherapy. - 7 - Essential oils also repre sent alternatives to antibiotics due to its resistance properties and are alternatives to expensive treatments with unfavourable risk, benefits and cost . For example , recent ly in Brazil a new anti - inflammatory phytop harmaceutical was developed based on an extract from the leaves of Cordia verbenaceous standardised in -humulene (12) (Acheflan\u00ae) (Matias et al. 2013) and is now supplanting established synthetic anti-inflammatory drugs on the local market. This product is based on the traditional usage of this Brazilian medicinal plant utilising an evidence -based phytotherapy approach. There are currently several FDA approved botanical s available in the global market including Veregen\u00ae (13) (Tea catechins ) for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts (Chen et al. 2008) and Fulyzaq\u00ae (14) (extract from the red sap of the Croton lechleri for the treatment of HIV diarrhoea . cannabidiol (16) (anti-inflammatory ) has been approved since 2005 in many countries (eg. Canada , The United Kingdom , Germany and New Zealand ). This botanical prescription drug is an oromucosal spray cannabinoid medicine for the treatmen t of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis and neuropathic breads of various origins . Marinol\u00ae (17) (dronabinol) and Cesamet\u00ae (18) (nabilone) are on the North -American market for the treatment of vomiting and nausea associated with the chemotherapy of cancers. More recently, in 2012 the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board approved a dry extract of Dioscorea nipponica , a traditional Chinese botanical to relief headache, muscl e pain and cramps (Gilber t 2012) . This was the first time that a TCM product (Traditional Chinese Medicine) was introduced in a European Union country . The i nclusion of traditional medicines in the development of 21st century treatment paradigms can facilitate economical accessib ility, convenience and acceptability . Single -molecule NPs and medicinal extracts As mentioned , plants ha ve been the inspiration for an important number of current drugs today on the market. Though, part of the drug discovery process is based on serendipit y, important discoveries have been initiated on the traditional usage of medicinal plant s and subsequent isolation of their bioactive constituents . Substantial synergy and benefits for the development of improved medicines and new drugs can arise from link ing these powerful analytics to robust ethno -medicinal and ethno -botanical studies of traditional medicines (Ngo et al. 2013) . Evidence on the traditional usage of medicinal plants still represents a source for drug discovery and this knowledge and its implication in drug development are today well defined in the frame work of biodiversity laws even if they a re not always easy to implement. - 8 - The usage, most importantly the efficacy and safety of traditional medicines can be validated by clinical studies formulated according to the tradition al preparation or on standardi zed extracts. From a pharmacological viewpoint , in many cases , the clinical efficacy of a given plant is not always explainable by the presence of a single active NP. In essence , the usage of traditional preparation s (eg. tea, decoction , tincture ) correspond s to the intake of highly complex mixture s of NPs that potentially may have mode of action s on multiple targets (Gertsch 2011) . This becomes complicated when the preparations consist of a mixture of varying herbs as in the case of Traditional Chine se medicine (TCM ) (Buriani et al. 2012) . In the perspective of the drug discovery process , the development of drug leads ensure s the beneficial effects of such herbal preparation s to be valuable from a global health perspective. The pharmerging markets (Pharmergings are defined as \" emerging countries in the pharmaceutical world market\" ) will double their expenditure on pharmaceuticals, growing to $150 -165 Bn by 2016, and driven by rising incomes, continued low cost for drugs, and government sponsored programs will aim to increase access to medicines in developing countries (Kleinrock 2014) . Such observations have led to the development of drugs that instead of being pure NPs, are actually plant -based extracts with defined composition. Such NP extracts are often referred to as phytopharmaceuticals (EU) or botanicals (USA) (Chen et al. 2008; Hoffman and Kishter 2013) . Their status varies from country to country based on the health claims which are made , and can be registered either in the form of dietary supplements or as drugs per se if clinical studies are performed and registration is approved . As previously mentioned, a recent example is the approval of Veregen \u00ae (an enriched extract of tea polyphenols), for the treatment of genital warts linked t o human papilloma vi ruses (HPV) (Scheinfeld 2008) . The same extract is currently under clinical trials against various cancers as both a preventative and as a direct agent (Newman and Cragg 2012) . Formulating NP extracts is crucial in a pharmaceutical perspective for the cure, treatment or prevention of diseases (botanicals) but also from a food industry viewpoint in obtaining positive health profiles (eg. nutraceutical functional food) (Wolfender et al. 2011) . The notable concerns , especially when dealing with plant extracts is th e presence of potential pesticide s and heavy metals as per the requirements of the Good Agricultural Practices (GAP ) (Zhang et al. 2010) . Toxic constituents ( eg. hepatotoxic compounds acids ) (Stickel et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2012) and the risk s associated with additional drug interactions must be identified beforehand prior to human administration . Plants that can be used in such preparations should be Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) , a classification that is recognized by regulation authorities such as the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA) (Nicoletti 2012) . In order to safeguard a - 9 - continuous and approvabl e therapeutic effect the chemical co mposition of such multifaceted plant -based NP extracts has to be authenticated . Standardization procedure s currently exist and are based on the quantification of the active principle(s) (when they are known ), the detecti on of chemical marker(s) for assessing the correct botanical origin of the plant material, the acquisition of the complete metabolite profile (met abolome) and a comprehensive estimation of the biologi cal variability of the extracts (van der Kooy et al. 2009) . In addition, depending on the nature of the plant material use d, various analytical validations have to be performed to ensure the absence o f toxic or allergenic compounds (Ribnicky et al. 2008) . These procedures ensure the quality of the botanical in terms of its composition and safety for human consumption . Unlike a pure compound the pharmacological mode of action of such a multicomponent mixtu re is far more complicated to ascertain and takes into account the bioa vailability of the constituents, the presence of pro -drugs and the likelihood of synergetic effects (Wagner and Ulrich -Merzenich 2009) . Pro-drugs in natural product extracts In plants many NPs exist in the form of c onjugates w ith sugar moieties (called glycosides) . In this way, plants store key secondary metabolites which are often involve d in defense . These process es have been optimized though evolutionary processes as many of the glycosides are activated upon cell disruption to yield highly active defense compounds ( eg. glucosinolates the glycosides are not active directly on therapeutic targets however they can become bioactively efficient upon metabolization . The glycosides are not active directly on therapeutic targets only when they are subjected to an enzymatic process activating the pro -drug. Another example include s laxative herbs ( eg. Aloe) anthrones which are present in the form of C-glycosides that reach the intestine intact, and are hydrolyzed in the intestine in a reductive environment to reach their target in the form of a nthrones (Bruneton 2009) . Plant extracts may thus contain bioactive NPs in the form of pro -drugs and i n some cases these compounds can provide optimize d derivatives for reaching therapeutic targets . In several cases , NPs per se have surpassed evolution to be active in ecological interactions and have been optimized for human usage , this explain s why an important proportion of NPs are required to be chemically modified for optim al efficacy with reduced toxicological effects (Newman and Cragg 2012) . In addition , chemical modification s of NPs can result in the enhancement of the biological activity (based on an established pharmacophore), leading to a n ew entity. It is important to mention that the structure of a \"new\" natural product cannot be patented per se , only the extraction/purification processes and/or the use and/or its application. In other words a patent office will grant a patent, on a chemic al structure which - 10 - was naturally pre -existing in nature only through the extraction process or industrial application which have to be truly inventive (Anonymous 1973) . Synergy: Th e \"totum \" effect ! The longstanding, successful usage of herbal drug combinations in traditional medicine makes it necessary to discover a rationale for the pharmacological and therapeutic superiority of many NPs in comparison to isolated single molecules (Wagner and Ulrich -Merzenich 2009) . In this respect, due to the conc omitant presence of the bioactive NPs in natural product extracts, synergistic effects are likely to occur. These properties have been disputed claiming superior pharmacological effects of mixtures of compounds in botanicals over mono - substances . Such effe cts, as well as poly -pharmacology (a given molecule binds to different targets) (Gertsch 2011) are however difficult to p rove experimentally. Synergistic effects , can result in the following: i) the constituents of a NP extract affect s different targets ii) they can interact with one another to improve th e solubility and thereby enhancing the bioavailability of one or several substances of an NP extract and iii) compounds may also have their efficacy enhanced with agents that an tagoni ze mechanisms of resistance (Wagner and Ulrich -Merzenich 2009) . The verification of a given synerg istic effect can be achieved by comparing the pharmacological effects of the mono -substance s versus the combination of substances by analyzing isobole curves based on data from several dose combinations. The analysis of such curves enable s for the discrimination between s imple additive effects, antagonistic interactions or real synergism with poten tiated or over -additive effects (Berenbaum 1989; Yang et al. 2013) . Synergistic effects have been studied , for example , the combination of ginkgolide A (19) and B (20), two compounds known to have anti -PAF effects in phytopharmaceutical preparations of Ginkgo biloba . The study of the isobole curve s with different doses of these compounds demonstrated clear synergetic effects (Wagner 2005) . Many of these types of studies as well as multi -target effects [summarized in reference (Wagner 2011) ] has presented evidence for the therapeutic superiority of plant extracts over singl e isolated constituents, as well as their bioequivalence wi th synthetic chemotherapeutics. Despite evolutionary clues to molecular synergism in nature, sound experimental data is lacking and new concepts such as poly-pharmacology and network pharmacolo gy are emerging in the context of the pharmacology of botanical drugs (Gertsch 2011) . Depending on the molecular machinery, synergisms can be produced by differential ( eg. allosteric) ligand interactions in one single protein or downstream effects. Different drugs may act synergistic ally simply by partially inhibiting different nodes in a given biological networ k that leads to gene expression (Gertsch 2011) . - 11 - Poly-pharmacology and synergisms are creating the next paradigm in NP drug discovery. Complex aspect s (multi -component mixtures acting in complex biolog ical systems) may be tackle d by emer ging systems biology approaches (Wang et al. 2005; Fitzgerald et al. 2006; Verpoorte 2012) . In particular ,\"omics \" approaches have been used recently , more extensively for the stud y of TCMs (Buriani e t al. 2012) . For example , NMR based metabolomics has been applied to the study of human biological responses to chamomile tea ingestion. The strategy enable d the characterization of the metabolic effects of chamomile ingestion despite the high degree of variation from ge netic and environmental sources (Wang et al. 2005) . This study highlighted markers related to the ingestion of herbs and demonstrate d the potential of such an approach in th is emerging field. To date , and despite the rapid development of systems biology only a few studies have b een published , but c omprehensive approaches that combine phytoprofiling and metabotyping are now emerging (Xie et al. 2013) . From a clinical viewpoint, systems biology approaches guided by Chinese m edicine have revealed new markers for sub -typing rheumatoid arthri tis patients (van Wietmarschen et al. 2009) and similar strategies have also be en applied for studying effects of TCM for complex diseases. Altogether , such holistic approaches might provide evidence of efficacy of personalized medicine , which is intrinsically linked to the usage of traditional medicine by healers (Verpoorte et al. 2005) , such studies might ultimately lead to evidence -based phytotherapy and provide a means to differentiate placebo effects from existing pharmacological efficacy. The interaction of drugs with botanical extracts While extracts and multicomponent mixture s are often argued to have higher efficacy than single constituent s in the context of phytotherapy , the alternative is that the ingestion of these complex mixtures have greater probability to lead to drug -drug interactions, and i n this context many herbs or botanicals are at risk (Posadzki et al. 2013) . , phyto -preparations containing Hypericum perforatum (Saint John's Wort) have demonstrated to cause multiple drug interactions through induction of t he cytochrome P450 . The metabolism of these drugs increases , resulting in a decrease in the concentration and thus has negatively impacted clinical effects. In this case , the prin cipal constituents thought to be responsible is hyperforin (21) which is the bioactive NP partly responsible for the pharmacological in vitro effects that have explained the anti - depressant activity of the NP extra ct (Muller et al. 2001) . In the in vitro pharmacological assays , the extract was found to be more active than hyperforin (21) alone , and some companies have marketed Saint John's Wort - 12 - extracts with low amount of hyperforin (21) to reduce such interactions whilst still claiming good clinical efficacy (Woelk 2000) . From c linical trials on traditional medicines to bioactive natural products and lead compounds (Reverse pharmacognosy ) In the field of drug discovery all information related to traditional medicine, clinical trials on NP extracts are potential source s for finding ne w targets by utilizing reverse pharmacology methodologies or explaining the mode of action of specific botanicals. Reverse pharmacology also known as \"target base d drug discovery \" became popular after the sequencing of the human genome which allowed for th e rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins. In this context \"Bedside to Bench\" approaches in combinations with systems biology may also be of great i nterest and t he application of a combination of ethno -pharmacological know -how with modern in silico tools may lead to the discovery of new NPs (Rollinger et al. 2006; Rollinger 2011) . Gene di fferential expression technologies in mechanistic studies of NP-derived drugs have also shown to be of significa nt potential (Chen and Jiang 2012) . At this l evel, systems biology approaches (Verpoorte et al. 2005; Verpoorte et al. 2009) and in silico tools may assist in the drug discovery process of the studies aimed at explaining the mode of action of traditional preparations. For example , clinical trials on GRAS botanicals w ith established traditional usage and well -defined composition may be conducted to demonstrate evidence of efficacy . Systems biology studies on well-defined cohort s should reveal biomarkers associated to the therapeutic effect s. Furthermore, target discove ry approaches may be conducted to understand the mode of action of NP extracts and the information of the active principles of the extracts may be retrieved by in vitro assays. Another approach is to use \"virtual screening\" software which uses existing lib raries of compounds to test panels of targets (eg. antitumor) with the aim of identifying selectivity and specific pharmacological activit ies (Lauro et al. 2012) . Ultimately , this strategy shoul d guide the drug discovery process in finding or develop ing new NPs as monosubstance s or formulate phytoextracts possessing ideal chemical profile s. Current methodologies for assessing biologically active natural products Complexity of natural extracts a nd lead identification Unlike classical medicinal or combinatorial chemistry compounds, NPs are reputedly difficult to screen and to advance in the R&D pipeline. The molecular complexity of most of the bioactive NPs ( number of asymmetric - 13 - centres, functiona l groups etc .) often discourages the researcher since their total or semi -synthesis is often not a trivial task. When the accurately identified sample enters the laboratory, its composition can differ according to edaphic and climatic parameters, seasonal variation, and may be contaminated by endophytic micro -organisms (eg. endophytic fungi residing in plants). Both terrestrial and marine organisms can contribute and/or modify its chemical composition, due to abiotic and biotic stresses which can be problem atic when attempting to re -isolate a class of novel NPs and these aspects should be taken into consideration more often with acuity (Kusari et al. 2012) . Undoubtedly , in industry HTS automation is the likely means of targeting bioactivity whilst in many academic institutions due to limitations in fun ding, HTS is not generally used in-house and often requires outsourcing . Of course, utilizing modern techniques of HTS at least in theory, can lead to the identification of NCEs and hits but the serendipity behind analyzing a less uncommon terrestrial or m arine organism should not be overlooked (Michael et al. 2008; Frearson and Collie 2009; Macarr\u00f3n et al. 2011) . The chemodiversity of NPs is much larger than those of synthetic compounds (Feher and Schmidt 2003) and when a scree ning campaign does not provide any result with classical organic compounds, NPs represents the final opportunity to address this issue. NPs play a significant biological role in terrestrial and marine organisms, and have evolved to interact with enzymes, receptors and ionic channels. They have the reputable advantage of being born to be active in living cells, able to cross membranes, interfere with enzymes or even act against parasites. It is noteworthy to mention that many human pharmaceutical targets ha ve equivalent systems in the organisms studied for their NP content. Natural products belong to chemical families that have been known since the 19th century, but the number of possible combinations is unlimited and minor chemical differences may have sign ificant pharmacological differences. Unquestionably, NPs are not designed for all targets but since many are defence products, they probably address vital and universal processes; this can explain why cancer drug discovery lures most of the research funds than in any other therapeutic area (Dan\u00edk et al. 2010) . High -throughput screening (HTS) versus evidenced -based traditional medicine From the beginning of the 19th century to the 1980s, NP discovery has relied mainly on clinical, pharmacological observations, traditional knowledge , well d ocumented usage ( evidenced -based phytotherapy ) and/or serendipity. Bioassays performed in the 20th century on small animals and isolated organs provided the vast majority of the chemical entities currently on the pharmace utical market today . HTS was rising from 1 ,000 assays to 200,000 assays per day by the middle of the 2000s. Crude extracts were effectively evaluated in 96 and subsequently 384 well plates where the \"target enzymes/receptors\" ushered the combinatorial chemistry - 14 - screening methodologies. The subsequent lack of efficacy of the combichem libraries then led to the use of carefully chosen CC libraries that were built around NP skeletons such as the work carried out by Nicolaou in 1999 -2000 and Waldmann from 2002 onwards. When Big Pharmas started t heir discovery programs based on HTS techniques, NPs provided the bioactive diversity, with hundreds of thousands of structurally diverse compounds readily available for robotic automation . This technological revolution helped all the Big Pharmas to shift to this new paradigm. Research started from molecular target s, to the cell, to group s of cells, to isolated organ s, to small animals, to large r animals and then finally to patients. The random and systematic evaluation of huge libraries of chemicals likely to modulate a specific biological target is the principle of HTS (David and Ausseil 2014) . The series o f biological responses of chemical compounds or fractions after a HTS screening campaign produces \"hits.\" These results are then controlled, confirmed and validated in order to be amenable in the drug discovery program. \"Hits\" will then be optimi sed by cla ssical medicinal chemistry reactions in order to become \"leads,\" which then enter into preclinical development. HTS represents several advan tages as i t is fast and avoids the me -too approach , since this approach can provid e unexpected and potentially origi nal active compounds. The very small scale of the assays allows for hundreds of thousands of experiments to be performed within a single day but at this molecular level it is also a disadvantage since the interaction s of small molecule s with a receptor, an enzyme, and an ionic channel are only the very first step s in the discovery process . Therefore , hits are easily obtained but they are meaningless, valueless and void at the patient scale. As additional, novel elaborate assay s for example using, animal/hum an organs are generated , a significant amount of time and resources would still be inevitably invested . This broad funnel ling effect is named attrition and only around 1 in a million of the evaluated molecules in fact escapes this attrition and reaches the market through to FDA approval . Pre-fractionated NP extract libraries are also used in HTS and are demonstrating interesting activities in a wide variety of screens/diseases with novel agents being found from plant s, microbe s and marine organisms. Eldridg e et. al., (2002), describe their HTS process, in which each sample is separated by a parallel 4-channel preparative HPLC into 200 fractions that are then analysed by a parallel 8 -channel LC -ELSD -MS. The authors state that 60 % of the analysed fractions co ntain detectable compounds with 1 to 5 compounds per fraction. A total of 36 fractions containing detectable compounds can be made, and these fractions are collectively called \"the library\" from which smaller, more focused libraries are drawn for screening and rapid purification, however this leads to a substantial increase in expenditure (Eldridge et al. 2002) . Another disadvantage of HTS versus approaches based on careful selection on well documented traditional usage is the narrowness of the screening. In evidence -based phytotherapy it is likely that the molecular and - 15 - pharmacological mechanism will be identified, however when working on NP extracts it is not possible to use a magic-wand to isolate every compound present. For example, a single plant extract can contain from hundreds to thousands of structurally different compounds belonging to various compound classes (Verpoorte et al. 2005) . Evidence -based phytotherapy is a complementary approach which can provide reliable research orientations by the valorisation of plants traditionally for a long time in the market for which bioactive principles or standardi zed extracts can be valorised with less risk of toxicity compared to classical HTS based on serendipity . The financial investments necessary to market a new chemical entity ( NCE ) are substantial and many pharmaceutical groups are relying on the historical, well known active principles on the traditional usage of medicinal agents which represents a valid and reputable source of evidence (Helmst\u00e4dter and Staiger 2013) . The most important factors for improving the drug discovery process are the enhancement of predictability and confidence of the target (Bunnage 2011) . Initially, the methodology began with phenotypic screening, to HTS and then to no phenotypic scre ening but target based screening in combi -chem/HTS finally to HTS and high content screening (Swinney and Anthony 2011) . HTS automation allows for the understanding of a large number of pharmacological experiments on very basic models. Before beginning screening on the basic assay, the next step would be to utilize more sophisticated assays an d finally the delivery of a clinical evaluation on humans has to be selected and fully anticipated. This scheduling is required , otherwise the project will reach a bottleneck, this is why high content screenings are appreciated in order to save time -consum ing steps. One example includes the zebrafish model which provides many advantages for drug discovery screening programs. The zebrafish, Danio rerio , is a small, tropical freshwater fish from India whose embryos are usable as in vivo HTS models. It has bee n nicknamed the \"vertebrate drosophila,\" since it is genetically tractable as a model of developmental biology and the living embryos can be used in the HTS screening in simple and reliable drug discovery programs. Several hundreds of eggs are produced by female, the cost of the embryos is very low and the development is efficient. The zebrafish model is the perfect tool to run High Content Throughput Screening (Challal et al. 2012) . The embryos are transparent a nd it is possible to study the effect of a molecule on different organs at the same time on the living animal and hundreds of transgenic lines are available (Novodvorsky et al. 2013) . Zebrafish is an efficient model not only for the drug discovery process but also for ta rget validation, toxicity studies and drug optimization (Li et al. 2012) . Limitations in natural product discovery - 16 - Chemotaxonomy Natural organisms and in particular pl ants are often collected by the researchers and u nlike the medicinal chemist s who purchase their starting materials from an e-catalogue, the NP researchers' collect s the plant s themselves or through botanist s. When carrying out HTS , collections (terrestrial or marine) need to be substantial to provide opti mal sampling . According to chemotaxonomy , a vast systematic diversity within samples will offer a qualitatively vast chemodiversity and a high taxonomic difference between two samples will provide high chemical diversity. However, taxonomy has its limitati ons especially when dealing with endophytic organisms ( eg. bacteria and fungi) residing on terrestrial and marine organisms (eg. plants and algae). If this is the case , it is likely that that a proportion of the NPs isolated from plants are actually produc ts of interactions between microbes in and around the plant than from the plant itself. Working on marine organisms is even more complicated due to the logistics in sample collection, recollection, and taxonomical identification. Most of the time marine or ganisms are unique biocenosis (biological communities) for example; two organisms living one meter a part from each other can present different chemical compositions . In one example, Jing and co -workers, isolated three anthracenediones from an unidentified endophytic fungus, colonising mangrove s (Jiang et al. 2000) . Another example includes t he isolation of 4 cytohalasins and 11 novel sesquiterpenoids from the cultures of the mitosporic fungus, Geniculosporium sp., an endophyte associated with the red alga Polysiphonia sp. (Krohn et al. 2005) , therefore consideration should be taken with taxonomical identification. Methods for the isolation and identification of e ndophytes are well documented by (Zhang et al. 2006) . Obtaining the correct \"Latin name \" for a collected organism or determining the correct scientifi c name is not trivial . The most difficult task is to source a terrestrial or marine organism in the wild with the correct genus and species . Herbarium vouchers need to be prepared, since DNA analysis has not yet replaced herbarium samples. Field collection s and botanical identification cannot be automated unlike biological screening and combinatorial chemistry (Miller 2011) . Implementation of HTS requires only small amounts of plant material, but very quickly, additional amounts will be required for \"hit\" confirmations and even larger quantities for further pharmacological assays and preparation of analogues by medicinal chemistry. Further studies, very dependent on plant recollection are often disappointing since anthropic pressure can lead within only a few weeks to an irreversible loss of organisms and habitats. Respecting the protected species, avoiding du plication in libraries, collecting the correct plant species which are not sterile since identification is based on flower and fruit architecture are noteworthy tasks . The precise scientific nomenclature associated with a collection enables a - 17 - fruitful usag e of databases; for example the Dictionary of Natural Products ( www.dnp.chemnetbase.com ) which correlates plant names and chemical content. Valid names and systematic botany could be perceived as limitations but are nevertheless precious for the NP chemist (Erkens 2011) . Taxonomy is cumbersome due to the intricate issues of synon ymy which add complications to the use of databases and bibliographic references. Systematic botany appears to be out -dated in the midst of the modern \"omics\" techniques but its role is still substantial. The disinterest for systematic botany and the poor renewal of specialists is somewhat alarming as plant taxonomists themselves are an endangered species ! Access and benefit sharing issues When collecting plant s, botanical identification is not the only factor to take in to consideration. Respect of rights of the land owner, of d iverse laws (protected species), phytosanitary and customs regulations are key and crucial aspects . A significant change occurred on the 29th of December 1993, upon the entry in the application of the Convention on Biological Diversi ty which moved the genetic resources from common heritage of mankind to the sovereignty of the states where they live. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was an agreement signed in June , 1992 by the international commu nity in Rio de Janeiro, Braz il. The three objectives of the CBD are to conserve the biodiversity, to sustainably use the genetic resources and to share the benefits arising from the use of these resources in a fair and equitable manner . Article 2 of the CBD, defines biodiversity as -\"the variability among living organisms from all sources of terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and ecological complexes .\" This includes ecosystem diversity, species diversity be tween and within species . The scope of the CBD applies only to genet ic resources according to Article 2: \"Genetic resources\" defined as \"any material of plant, animal, microbial or other origin containing functional units of heredity of actual or potential value .\" In the 1990s, it was apparent to the Big Pharma industries that the national claims about the genetic resources will overflow to the biological resources. These latter resources being the NPs, the secondary metabolites are valued by pharmaceutical and cosmetics enterprises. This situation created juridical uncerta inty which diverted most of the P harma sector from NP discovery programs . In the late 1990s many pharmaceutical companies decommissioned their NP discovery programs or merged. Further details are presented in Table 1 below. [Insert Table 1 Here ] - 18 - To impro ve this unfavourable situation, the international community united in Nagoya in October , 2010 to clarify access to biological and genet ic resources . The Nagoya Protocol (NP) cover ing access to genetic and non-genetic resources was agreed as an international instrument. NP s will contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity through the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the ir uses which in turn, will result in livelihood gains to both developing and Western countries. All public or private researchers will be required to seek Prior Informed Conse nt (PIC) and to negotiate a Mutually Agreed Term (MAT) with the repr esentative of the source country . According to the Aichi objectives, these regulations will have to be implemented in the party states by 2015. Anyone entering in R&D processes will requir e a PIC and a MAT negotiated with the source country about conditions of Access and Benefit Sharing. According to Article 2, R&D on NPs is clearly covered by this new regulation as per, (Article 2c: \"Utilization of genetic resources\" defined as \"conduct ing research and development on the genetic and/or biochemical composition, including through the application of biotechnology\" ). One should expect flexible accessibility to rules to be realistic and beneficial to all parties. Some biodiversity -rich countries have already implemented national regulations, but their practical application s and interpretation are o ften cumbersome. There is a disparity between theoretical regulations and their everyday applicability (Kingston 2011) . Stringent rules on accessing genetic resources may have counterproductive and paradoxical effects for conserva tion and research even locally (Gilbert 2010) . There is generally a huge asymmetry between expectations of Benefit Sharing of biodiversity -rich co untries and the possible benefit sharing of the academic or industrial users in the fields of pharmacy and cosmetology. Often enough, access permits to biodiversity -rich countries are fairly difficult to negotiate and require several years of uncertain pro cesses. The issue and suspicion about bio- prospecting can be explained by historical standing points of exploitation of national , natural resources drifting from colonial times. The seminal contract betwee n Merck and INBio in 1991 was often mentioned as an example to follow , but no commercial results and return s on investments occurred. This contract has received critics later by some NGOs for insufficient local consultations. The improbable large turn over provided by some unique NPs like taxoids unfortunat ely does not reflect the reality of possible returns from pharmaceutical industries. In the academic sector also, the probability of such success is extremely low. For example, the N CI worked for decades on 114,000 extracts from 12, 000 different species to find only paclitaxel and camptothecin (Kingston 2011) . Some very important ques tions remain unanswered: there is no clear cut between the commodities (outside the scope) and the resources included in the scope, the possible retroactivity by date of usage. Access and Benefit Sharing national laws will be implemented , the impact on NP drug discovery - 19 - research activities , on innovation and business activities in the near future . Adequate regulations are expected to be taken in order to make this international legislative process effective and conducive towards achieving the access, benefi t sharing and conservation of biodiversity objectives . Future directions in natural product research Natural product research is still advancing even though it is difficult to maintain long -term expensive R&D programs, especially in the pharmaceutical ind ustry, but this will likely survive and develop in academic universities (Beutler 20 09). There are great expectations, on both the pharmaceutical industry and to some extent, academic institutes to identify the elusive, 'magic bullet' , however it is likely that natural drugs may evolve d from single -molecule NPs to well -defined enriched b ioactive extracts . As technologies for NPs advances , analyses of limited amounts of compounds present in extracts for biological screening will be possible due to increases in both the sensitivity and dynamic linear range (Hong 2011; Schmitt et al. 2011) . Advances in ultra-sensistive analytics for the rapid identification of novel bioactive NPs and sophisticated NMR structure prediction software will continue to improve the efficieny of the NP discovery process (Baker 2007) . Natu ral product studies have an image of sophisticated and often hyphenated techniques that often fails when dealing with complex mixtures . This can be overcome by emerging fields such as metabolomics which deals with mixtures and uses the power of multivariat e statistics to identify potential biomarkers (eg. new or a unique class of natural products) (Roessner 2011) . Data mining approaches to identify bioactive NPs in mixtures, from a library of terrestrial and marine organisms are currently being developed and will be essential for the development of effective multiple -agent drugs from traditional medicines (Ngo et al. 2013) . Another aspect will be the assessment of the variation of the metabolome of body fluids in the framework of clinical trials, involving complex phytopharmaceutical or herbal preparations to completely assess the efficacy of such therapies though a systems biology approach (van Wietmarschen et al. 2009; Wang and Chen 2013) . Conclusion s The indust rial usage of dietary supplements, botanic als or phytopharmaceuticals in Western countries and traditional plants in developing countries is expanding readily as well as emerging technologies (eg. metabolomics) and the advent of sensitive analytics will ensure the quality control of these products on the market . Progress in traditional medicine , drug control based research on DNA analyses and gene differential - 20 - expression is providing a new frontier . The WHO is aware of the importance of the world's terrestr ial and marine biodiversity, especially with regards to medicinal plants which have a track record of offering unique and affordable therapeutic solutions for minor disorders and sometime even major diseases like malaria to both developing and Western coun tries. Seventy percent of people rely on plants (either as mono -substances or botanical extracts), most of the time, this is not by ideological choice but by economic reasons. Modern techniques for the quality control of traditional drugs will continue to validate the positive benefits, costs -risk ratio of such therapies (Jiang et al. 2010) and, DNA analyses and gene differential expression techniques will hopefully actively develop in pharmerging and less advanced countries. Pharmergings are defined a s \"emerging countries in the pharmaceutical world market .\" Translational medicine, evidence -based phytotherapy and research focussing on NP -mixtures will provide new insight and innovation. These fields will develop while pharmaceutical productivity is fac ing a crisis with continued rising R&D costs and reduced drug approvals. Therefore the historical 'Green Rush' for new chemical entities from biodiversity represented by HTS of natural products between 1990 and 2000 represents only a minor aspect of utilisation and valorisation of these substances in human health. In fact, most of the big pharmas have terminated their HTS and bioprospecting programs. Nowadays, the overall productivity of the big pharma industries is declining despite investment into new te chnologies such as combichem, rational drug and biotechnologies, but silently NP research is renewing especially through academic sector collaborations . When \"blue -chip\" companies closed their bioprospecting programs they kept an eye on start -ups and unive rsities. One important aspect is the p reservation of biodiversity and access to organisms , in particular in biodiversity rich countries which constitute a key issue wh ich could hamper a serene utilisation of natural products to develop new drugs (as pure compounds or ext racts) in developing countries (Genilloud 2012) . Nevertheless, researchers in public and private sectors need juridical security. Access to samples in particular in biodiverse rich countries is problematic and ironically, in the meantime the losses of b iodiversity under overexploitation and anthropic pressures have never been so dramatic. Natural products are of high intrinsic value, but they carry many risk factors such as legal access, supply and re -supply, identification of activity, intellectual prop erties and the value chain is long and uncertain. One of the major challenges is to implement fair, reliable, simple, and transparent access regulations. The forthcoming implementation of the Nagoya Protocol should break the vicious circle of unrealistic e xpectations and conditions of accessibility t o biodiversity for researchers. - 21 - Declaration of interest The authors state no conflict of interest and have received no payment in preparation of this manuscript.
