Purpose In order to stre ngthen access to health care, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of health care, the member states of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing licensing and regulatory authority of state medical boards, provides a streamlined process that allows physicians to become licensed in multiple states, thereby enhancing the portability of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients. The Compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a state's existing Medical Practice Act. The Compact also adopts the prevailing standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at the time of the physician -patient encounter, and therefore requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state medical board where the patient is located.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Interstate Commission exercises its r ulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Interstate Commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect. (b) Rules deemed appropriate for the operations of the Interstate Commission shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 2010, and subsequent amendments thereto. (c) Not later than thirty (30) days after a rul e is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices; provided, that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the Interstate Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the authority granted to the Interstate Commission. 16. Oversight of Interstate Compact (a) The executive, legislative and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce the Compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compact's purposes and intent.

(b) The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the Commissioners, initiate legal action in the United States D istrict Court for the District of Columbia, or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal 31 offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact, and its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (c) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession. 18. Default Proce dures (a) The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a member state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by the Compact, or the rules and bylaws of the Interstate Commission promulgated under the Compac t.

The Interstate Commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cur e its default, and (2) provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (c) If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Commissioners and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by the Compact shall terminate on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the p eriod of the default. (d) Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to terminate shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the maj ority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and each of the member states.

The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. 19.

No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the memb er states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the member states. 21. Withdrawal (a) Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every member state; provided, that a member state may w ithdraw from the Compact by specifically repealing the statute which enacted the Compact into law. (b) Withdrawal from the Compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same, but shall not take effect until one (1) year after the effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other member state. 33 (c) The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writin g upon the introduction of legislation repealing the Compact in the withdrawing state.

(b) Upon the dissolution of the Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force o r effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be concluded and surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws. 23. Severability and Construction (a) The provisions of the Compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Compact shall be enforceable. (b) The provisions of the Compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes. (c) Nothing in the Compact shall be construed to prohibit the applicability of other interstate compacts to which the states are members. 24.

(c) All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the Commission, are binding upon the member states. (d) All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.
