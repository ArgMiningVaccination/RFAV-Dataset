For many, this period is one of setting goals, creating resolutions, and building inspiration and motivation. However, maintaining those goals can become increasingly challenging as our regular routines pick up their pace again. We all know what it's like to realize that our resolutions have fallen to the wayside as we become wrapped up in the numerous demands of our everyday lives. That's not to say that the practices of checking in with oneself, adopting new habits and setting intentional goals for the future are futile, though. In fact, the wisdom of such practices goes back thousands of years. In Ayurvedic tradition, ritucharya is a set of guidelines that informs us on how to live seasonally. Ayurveda posits the fundamental interconnectedness of our minds, bodies, spirits and external environments; when the environment changes, we must adapt our [diet](https://www.umaoils.com/blogs/uma-oils/kapha-season-essentials-exercise-diet-wellness-tips-for-thriving-this-winter-season), [beauty and wellness](https://www.umaoils.com/blogs/uma-oils/4-ayurvedic-beauty-wellness-practices-for-winter) practices accordingly in order to maintain homeostasis.

Plus, many Ayurvedic practices are extremely simple to incorporate into one's daily routine\u2014not to mention that they also feel like luxurious acts of self-care. Feeling motivated to make resolutions you can keep up all year round? These 5 Ayurvedic detox practices will leave you feeling like your best self this year, delivering long-lasting rejuvenation, vitality and wellness. 1. Try Out Dry Brushing for Boosted Circulation & Energy Dry brushing, or Garshana, is an Ayurvedic practice that involves applying a natural firm-bristled body brush in firm motions all over the body. While this practice only takes a few minutes to complete, its long-term benefits are numerous: firstly, it improves lymphatic drainage, which in turn promotes the expulsion of toxins from the body. [Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/manual-lymphatic-drainage) has also shown that a healthy and active lymphatic system can alleviate swelling and irritation. In addition, dry brushing boosts circulation, which is vital for the distribution of nutrients and white blood cells throughout our body and for maintaining a radiant, youthful complexion. On a more immediate level, dry brushing is a naturally exfoliating process that helps to release dirt and skin follicles, and it also instills feelings of groundedness and energy. We think this transformative practice is so important that we created our own organic, vegan and artisan-crafted [Lymphatic Detox Dry Brush](https://www.umaoils.com/products/lymphatic-detox-dry-brush?_pos=1&_sid=cd041e517&_ss=r) for a luxurious detoxification experience.

Oil Pull in the Mornings for Long-Lasting Detox [Oil pulling](https://www.umaoils.com/blogs/uma-oils/why-oil-pulling-is-a-secret-weapon-for-wellness?_pos=2&_sid=5e6ecbd0a&_ss=r) is a potent Ayurvedic detox practice that involves swishing oil in the mouth for 10-20 minutes in the morning before brushing one's teeth. In Ayurveda, the mouth is believed to reflect the body's health, as it serves as a site that harbors bacteria, toxins, and other impurities. Oil pulling rids the mouth of these impurities, or ama. As research has shown, the powerful effects of this detoxifying practice include the [reduction of plaque and gingivitis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4382606/), a [boosted metabolism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198813/) and even [an increase in overall longevity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198813/). Given that accumulating bacteria in the mouth can lead to a variety of health conditions, from gut issues to autoimmune diseases, oil pulling is a simple practice that has profound implications for fighting off illness and disease. It may also freshen breath and promote teeth whitening. To oil pull, simply swish 1-2 teaspoons of oil (such as our [Pure Detox Oil Pulling Treatment](https://www.umaoils.com/products/uma-pure-detox-oil-pulling-treatment?_pos=1&_sid=85bc3aa45&_ss=r&variant=35594774872231)) in the mouth for 10-20 minutes before spitting it out and rinsing the mouth in warm water. You can take a shower or carry out the rest of your morning routine as you oil pull, making it a seamless and easy practice to incorporate into your daily life. 3.
