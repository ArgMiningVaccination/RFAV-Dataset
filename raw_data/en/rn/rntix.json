Detoxifying the body requires maintaining a healthy lifestyle through diet, exercise and weight loss.", "sitename": "MedicineNet", "date": "2021-07-09", "cleaned_text": "There have been a few published medical studies on the use of detox foot pads or how they work. For centuries, the use of detox foot pads has been a common natural practice for body detoxification in Asia. A detox foot pad has a sticky part that you stick to your foot while you [sleep](https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm), which claims to draw out your body toxins through your skin. In the morning, when you peel off the detox pad, you may see that it has changed color, indicating that the supposed toxins have been extracted from your body. - Footpads are practiced by naturopaths and alternative health practitioners, however, the allopathic medical community opposes the use of these pads. - There are limited scientific explanations or studies on how detox foot pads work. - The body can detoxify itself via its organs: the [liver](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm), skin, [lungs](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm)and kidneys. - After using detox foot pads, some people have noticed a difference, particularly in terms of [better sleep](https://www.medicinenet.com/20_tips_for_better_sleep/article.htm)and circulation to their [feet](https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm), although this could be a placebo effect. - Others claimed to have noticed no effects at all, making reviews for different detox foot pads vary greatly. - Not all detox foot pads are created equal, like many other natural products, since there are no rules or regulations regarding these pads. The consensus is there is no harm in trying occasional detox foot pads. However, do not take the \"detox\" claims seriously. No amount of footpads can replace a good night's [sleep](https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_quiz/quiz.htm), a healthy [diet](https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm) and an [exercise](https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm) schedule that will keep you healthy and relaxed. What are the different types of toxins in the body? Toxins pose numerous risks, such as directly poisoning the body, causing damage to the brain, liver, central nervous system and other vital organs. They also weaken the immune system, making it more susceptible to disease. Worse, they feed [cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm), [viruses](https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), bad bacteria, parasites, yeast and other invaders, contributing to disease onset, and they accelerate [aging](https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm) as well. Toxins are classified into the following three types: - Exogenous: Tobacco, [drugs](https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm), [stimulants](https://www.medicinenet.com/stimulants_for_adhd/drug-class.htm)( [alcohol](https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_metabolism/article.htm)), amalgams, carbon monoxide, lead, processed foods, skincare products and other external sources are sources of exogenous toxins. - Endogenous: Endogenous toxins are the result of viral and [bacterial infections](https://www.medicinenet.com/bacterial_infections_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), as well as by-products of bacteria and yeast metabolism in certain [intestines](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/intestines_picture/picture.htm). - Autogenous: As a result of the body's metabolism, autogenic toxins are produced, which may be the free radicals produced as cells convert food into energy. Toxins can have an immediate or delayed effect, and they can be localized or spread to different parts of the body. Furthermore, toxins have different effects on different parts of the body. As a result, it is best to avoid a buildup of toxins, which can be accomplished by altering [diet](https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm) and [stress](https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm) levels. Can the body detoxify itself? The body's detoxification process occurs naturally. Every day, the system works hard to convert toxins into less harmful compounds that the body can eliminate. There is little evidence to support detoxing with cleansing [supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm) or severely limiting your intake of certain foods. Such practices can even be detrimental. However, there are things you can do to assist your body to naturally cleanse itself. The liver, kidneys, [digestive system](https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm), lungs, skin and other organs form a complex detoxification system. You must keep these organs healthy so that they can [flush](https://www.medicinenet.com/hot_flashes/article.htm) out harmful substances. They may not be able to do their tasks successfully if they have too much to carry, such as owing to an unhealthy lifestyle and [stress](https://www.medicinenet.com/stress_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm). The following are some simple and healthy detoxification methods: - Drink more water, which aids in the removal of water-soluble toxins from your body. - Reduce your consumption of [sugar](https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_addiction_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), processed foods, salt, [caffeine](https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine/article.htm), alcohol and [smoking](https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm), among other things. - Consume foods that are free of contaminants. - Consume [fiber](https://www.medicinenet.com/fiber/article.htm)-rich foods or foods with high content of complex carbs. [Probiotic](https://www.medicinenet.com/probiotics/article.htm)foods, such as unsweetened yogurt, curds and kefir, can help improve intestinal microflora. - Consume antioxidant-rich foods, such as fresh fruits, dry fruits and colorful vegetables. - Be more active and engage in more physical activity and hobbies that pep your mood and [mental health](https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_health_psychology/article.htm). - Make sure you get enough and good quality sleep. - Visit a sauna for relaxation. - You can try healthy fasting in a variety of ways by choosing the one that works best for you. Our bodies are perfectly capable of receiving, digesting and removing components without the help of detoxes or [supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm) if they are in excellent health. The ideal method to improve our bodily processes is to live a healthy lifestyle without using trendy, fad diets or detoxes.
