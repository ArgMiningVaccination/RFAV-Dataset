In Chinese medicine, Qi is the vital energy that helps regulate the body and keeps it functioning normally. Any disruptions in the Qi are primarily seen as the source of physical and mental health issues including common ailments like the flu, fever, cough, depression and anxiety. We spoke to two Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners: Gianna Buonocore from [Integrated Medicine Institute](https://www.imi.com.hk) and Cecilia Cheung from [Health Wise](https://www.chinesemed.hk), for advice on which herbs to add to your diet to help boost your immune system and improve your general wellbeing.
