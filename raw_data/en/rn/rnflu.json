These ndings led us to study the role of sea hare hydrolysates (SHH) in cancer pathophysiology. SHH treatment-induced cells, cells, as did M2 macrophage polarization. In addition, SHH treatment inhibited the actions of M1 and M2 macrophages, which have anticancer and pro-cancer e ects, respectively, in non-small cell (TAMs). Furthermore, SHH death in A549 cells. SHH also downregulated STAT3 activation in macrophages and A549 cells, was recovered by colivelin, a STAT3 activator. SHH-induced reduction of M2 polarization and tumor growth was blocked by colivelin treatment. SHH-induced cell death did not occur in the manner of apoptotic signaling pathways, while the death pattern was mediated through pyroptosis /necroptosis, which causes membrane rupture, formation of vacuoles and bleb, activation of caspase-1, and secretion of IL-1 in SHH-treated A549 cells. However, combination necroptosis inhibitors, attenuated SHH's e ect on the cell viability of A549 cells. Taken together, SHH showed Cancers 2020 ,12, 726; doi:10.3390 /cancers12030726 www.mdpi.com /journal 2020 ,12, 24 anticancer e ects through a cytotoxic e ect on A549 cells and a regulatory e ect on macrophages in A549 cells. In addition, the SHH-induced anticancer e ects were mediated by non-apoptotic regulated cell death pathways under STAT3 inhibition. These results suggest that SHH may be o ered as a potential remedy for hare hydrolysates 1. Introduction Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate in Korea, and has done so for more than 10 years (Korean Government e-nara index, www.index.go.kr, 28 January 2020). Patients with lung cancer are typically diagnosed at a late stage, after too much progress, because there are no special symptoms at an early stage. Therefore, the methods for lung cancer treatment at the end stage are very limited. Recently , immunotherapy has been considered for patients with end-stage lung cancer. Furthermore, immune anticancer drugs are in the spotlight as a new treatment that compensates the shortcomings of chemotherapy and targeted anticancer drugs. In particular, the contribution of immunotherapeutic agents to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is increasing [ 1]. However, despite the benefits of immunotherapy , its use is limited for many lung cancer patients because of the cost and the requirement for treatment standards. The expression levels of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and other relevant biomarkers in NSCLC should be compatible with therapeutic standard [ 2]. At present, immuno-chemotherapy is attracting attention as a next-generation therapy that helps patients overcome through enhancement of immunity . Macrophages are a major regulator of inflammatory responses to disease and infections, and a main immune component of the tumor microenvironment [ 3,4]. Macrophages are polarized into specific phenotypes, generally described as the classically activated macrophage (M1) and the alternatively activated macrophage (M2), depending on the type of stimulant [ 5,6]. Traditionally , M1 and M2 reflect Type 1 and Type 2 helper T cell (T h1 and T h2) polarization of immune responses, respectively [ 5,7], and are associated with inflammatory and anti-inflammatory reactions, respectively [ 8]. With respect to cancer, macrophage subsets have been found to be highly involved in the cancer microenvironment. M1 exhibits anticancer effects, but M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumor growth, progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis in malignant cancers [ 5,9-11]. Developing molecules or modulators that properly regulate macrophage polarization may help to achieve positive results in cancer treatment. Several therapeutic agents, such as Getinib and Imatinib, suppress M2-like polarization in NSCLC [ (NF- \u0014B) and /or signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 are activated for M1 polarization, while STAT3, STAT6, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u000e, and /or PPAR for M2 polarization [ 14]. Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is also involved in M2 polarization [ 15]. Compared to M1 polarization, signaling pathways regarding M2 polarization are not fully established. The number of molecules identied as inhibitors of M2 polarization is also small. Sea hares secrete many kinds of bioactive molecules, which have various bioactivities [ 16,17]. The immunological activities of sea hares have already been demonstrated through our previous studies as follows: sea hare-derived glycosaminoglycans induce macrophage activation [ 18], and sea hare hydrolysate (SHH), which has higher bioactivities compared to extracts, reduce asthmatic parameters in mouse models of allergic asthma [ 19]. In addition, sea hare-derived glycosaminoglycans show cytotoxicity in stomach cancer cell AGS, but not in normal mouse ileum epithelial cells (patent KR20110132746A). These ndings led us to study the hypothesis that SHH may be able to treat lung cancer through the regulation of macrophages. This study was performed to identify the e ects of SHH on macrophage polarization and on growth of NSCLC using mouse and human macrophages, human TAMs, and human NSCLC cells.Cancers 2020 ,12, 726 3 of 24 2. Results 2.1. SHH-Induced Polarization of M1 Macrophages in RAW264.7 Cells The e ect of SHH on macrophage polarization was investigated in RAW264.7 cells. To determine the concentration of SHH to be used for subsequent experiments, that does not induce cell death in RAW 264.7 cells, an MTT assay was performed. The cells were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of SHH (1 to 100 \u0016g/mL) for 24 h.

Scale bar, 30 \u0016m. * p<0.05 compared to control (CTL).Cancers 2020 ,12, 726 4 of 24 To investigate the e ect of the concentration on macrophage activation, cells were treated with SHH at three di erent concentrations (1, 10, and 100 \u0016g/mL). SHH of all concentrations used in this experiment activated RAW264.7 cells. SHH-treated cells showed a large and flat morphology with spreads, vacuoles, and granules compared to the control, as did lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Figure 1B). The number of cells with vacuoles and granules was larger in the 10 and 100 \u0016g/mL SHH treatments than that in the 1 \u0016g/mL SHH treatment. The cell morphology changed by SHH was similar to the M1 phenotype stimulated by LPS and interferon gamma (IFN- ) [20]. To identify the M1 polarization state of SHH-treated cells, inducible nitric synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- (representative markers for M1 phenotype) mRNA expression patterns were evaluated. SHH treatment increased iNOS and TNF- mRNA expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1C). The e ect of SHH on iNOS and TNF- mRNA expression was similar to that of LPS (Figure 1D). Arginase-1 (Arg-1), a marker of the M2 phenotype, was not detected in RAW264.7 cells treated with SHH (100 \u0016g/mL) or LPS (1 \u0016g/mL) (Figure 1D). The response of RAW264.7 cells to interleukin (IL)-4 was also evaluated by detection of Arg-1 expression. RAW264.7 cells did not respond to IL-4 treatment, which typically induces Arg-1 expression in other macrophages. To identify whether Arg-1 is not actually expressed in the RAW264.7 cells under our experimental condition, mouse peritoneal macrophages were adopted. Arg-1 expression, but not iNOS, was detected in the mouse peritoneal macrophage treated with IL-4, indicating that RAW264.7 cells have a strong tendency to polarize into M1 (Figure 1E). SHH-treated cells showed high phagocytic ability, as judged by the in vitro phagocytosis ability assay, which measures the fluorescence intensity of positive for fluorescent beads co-culture RAW264.7 cells, and the phagocytized RAW264.7 cells showed green dots. There was no signicant di erence between SHH and LPS treatments in the ability of RAW264.7 cells phagocytize A549 cells ( p>0.05; Figure 1G). SHH-untreated RAW264.7 cells a very small amount of green fluorescence (Figure 1G). 2.2. Reduction of IL-4-Induced M2 Polarization in Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages by SHH Mouse peritoneal macrophages were used to analyze the expression pattern of the M1 and M2 markers following SHH treatment. Isolated primary macrophages were conrmed by staining with Cluster of di erentiation (CD) 14, a marker for monocytes /macrophages. CD14-positive cells stained in red accounted for 89.0 \u00062.0% in the isolated peritoneal cells (Figure 2A). SHH treatment upregulated the expression of iNOS (Figure 2B). Activation of the NF- \u0014B signaling pathway has been reported to induce M1 macrophage di erentiation and the consequent inflammatory e ects [ 14,21]. To establish if NF- \u0014B activation is in the SHH-induced and TNF- expression was inhibited by pretreatment with BAY11-7085 (Figure 2C), indicating that NF- \u0014B signaling is involved in SHH-induced upregulation of iNOS and TNF- expression. The expression of the M2 marker Arg-1 was increased by IL-4 and LPS treatment, but not SHH treatment. Rather, SHH treatment reduced Arg-1 expression upregulated by IL-4 treatment (Figure 2D). We checked whether p38 MAPK and STAT3 signals are related to the SHH e ect on M2 polarization. IL-4 activated p38 MAPK and STAT3, but their activation was decreased by SHH treatment in mouse peritoneal macrophages (Figure 2E). The activators (U-46619 for p38 and colivelin STAT3) combined with SHH recovered the p38 and STAT3 activities inhibited by SHH. In addition, the combination of IL-4 and the specic inhibitors (SB203580 for p38 or S3l-201 for STAT3) showed similar p38 and STAT3 activities to those in combination of IL-4 and SHH (Figure 2E). The IL-4-induced Arg-1 mRNA expression level was highly decreased by SHH treatment. Combined treatment with p38 and STAT3 inhibitors enhanced SHH's e ect on M2 marker mRNA expression. The Ym-1, another M2 marker, expression pattern in response to p38 and STAT3 modulators was similar to the Arg-1 expressionCancers 2020 ,12, 726 5 of 24 pattern (Figure 2F). The expression levels of Arg-1 and Ym-1 reduced by SHH were also recovered by combination with activators (U46619 and colivelin). Cancers 2020, 12, x 5 of 24 Figure 2.

The expression of the M2 marker Arg-1 was increased by IL -4 and LPS treatment, but not SHH treatment. Rather, SHH treatment reduced Arg -1 expression upregulated by IL-4 treatment (Figure 2D). We checked whether p38 MAPK and STAT3 signals are related to the SHH effect on M2 polarization . IL-4 activated p38 MAPK and STAT3 , but their activ ation was by SHH treatment in mouse peritoneal macrophages (Figure 2E). The activators (U-46619 for p38 and STAT3 activit ies inhibited by SHH .

SHH-Induced Suppression of M2 Macrophage Polarization Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) SHH treatment demonstrated an induction of M1 polarization and a reduction of M2 polarization in the mouse macrophage cell line and primary cells (Figures 1 and 2). The role of SHH in human macrophages was further studied. Tamm-Horsfall protein-1 (THP-1) cells, a human monocytic cell line, were erentiated to macrophages (M0) by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA; 150 nM) treatment. The M0 cells were further polarized to M1 cells by treatment with LPS (100 ng /mL) and IFN- (20 ng /mL) and to M2 cells by treatment with IL-4 (20 ng /mL) and IL-13 (20 ng /mL) for (100 \u0016g/mL ) added to the M0 cells at the time of the stimulant's treatment for polarization. Changes in the morphology and expression levels of the M1 and M2 markers were observed in M0 cells treated with inducers for M1 and M2 polarization or SHH. Most of the LPS /IFN- -treated cells exhibited the M1 phenotype with short spreading, vacuoles, and flat round shape, while many IL-4 /IL-13-treated cells exhibited an elongated shape of the M2 phenotype. SHH-treated cells showed a similar phenotype to M1 rather than M2 (Figure 3A).Cancers 2020 ,12, 726 6 of 24 Cancers 2020, 12, x 6 of 24 monocytic cell line, were differentiated to macrophages -13-acetate (PMA ; 150 nM ) treatment.

As shown in Figure 3B, SHH treatment increased the expression of M1 markers (IL -1, IL-6, and TNF), whereas it reduced the expression of M2 markers (CD206, CD209, and fibronectin -1). IL -10 showed very low expression in M0, so that it was difficult to compare its changes in cells treated with SHH. The Arg -1 M2 marker was not detected in human macrophages, despite numerous trials (Figure 3 B), like previous studies showed [22,23].

As shown in Figure 3B, SHH treatment increased the expression of M1 markers (IL-1 , IL-6, and TNF- ), whereas it reduced of M2 markers (CD206, CD209, and bronectin-1). IL-10 showed very low expression in M0, so that it was di \u000ecult to compare its changes in cells treated with SHH. The Arg-1 M2 marker was not detected in human macrophages, despite numerous trials (Figure 3B), like previous studies showed [22,23]. The p38 MAPK and STAT3 activities were investigated in M0 cells cultured for 8 h with LPS /IFN- , IL-4/IL-13, and /or SHH. SHH treatment markedly reduced and STAT3 activities in M0 cells, like LPS /IFN- did. The STAT3 activity was high in the IL-4 /IL-13 treatment, whereas it was low in the LPS/IFN- -treated cells. Moreover, SHH dramatically decreased IL-4 /IL-13-induced STAT3 activity (Figure 3C). The activators of p38 and STAT3 were pretreated before SHH treatment of the M0 cells. A downregulation of M2 markers and an upregulation of the M1 markers by SHH were inhibited by the STAT3 activator colivelin, but not the p38 activator U46619 in the downregulation of M2 markers (Figure 3D). TAMs were produced to identify SHH's e ect on tissue-resident macrophages present in the tumor microenvironment. M0 cells were cocultured with A549 cells at a 1:1 ratio for 4 days to establish a TAM-like phenotype, with and without SHH treatment, as previously described [ 24]. The cells were washed at the end of the incubation to remove the remaining cancer cells from the culture dish. RNA was extracted from TAMs, and semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to measure M1 and M2 marker expression. TAMs highly expressed M2 markers compared to M1 markers, indicating that TAMs exhibit an M2-like phenotype. SHH reduced the expression levelsCancers 2020 ,12, 726 7 of 24 of M2 markers (CCL18, CD206, CD209, bronectin-1, and IL-10), whereas it increased markers (IL-1 IL-6, activities were markedly reduced by SHH treatment (Figure 3F). 2.4. Anti-Cancer E ect of SHH by Modulation of Macrophages To identify whether SHH control the e ect of M1 and M2 cells on the growth of cancer cells, the macrophages were co-cultured with A549 cells at a 5:1 ratio for 48 h. Co-culture with M1 cells signicantly decreased the cell viability of A549 cells, while coculture with M2 increased the cell viability compared to that in coculture with M0. SHH treatment induced growth inhibition in all groups ( p<0.05; Figure 4A). Cancers 2020, 12, x 7 of 24 M0 cells, like LPS /IFN- did. T he STAT3 activity was high in the IL-4/IL-13 treatment , whereas it was low in the LPS/IFN --treated cells. Moreover, SHH dramatically decreased IL-4/IL-13-induced STAT3 activity (Figure 3 C). The a ctivators of p38 and STAT3 were pretreated before SHH treatment of the M0 cells . A downregulation of M2 markers and an upregulation of the M1 markers by SHH were inhibited by the STAT3 activator colivelin the p38 activator U46619 in the downregulation of M2 markers (Figure 3D). TAM s were produced to identify SHH's effect on tissue - resident macrophages present in the tumor microenvironment.

SHH (CCL18, CD206, CD209, fibronect in-1, and IL -10), whereas it increased th e expression of M1 markers (IL -1, IL -6, and TNF -) (Figure 3 E). In TAMs, STAT3 and p38 activities were markedly reduced by SHH treatment (Figure 3 F). 2.4. Anti-Cancer Effect of SHH by Modulation of Macrophages To identify whether SHH control the effect of M1 and M2 cells on the growth of cancer cells , the macrophages were co -cultured with A549 cells at a 5:1 ratio for 48 h. Co-culture with M1 cells significantly decreased the cell viability of A549 cells , while coculture with M2 increased the cell viability compared to that in coculture with M0 . SHH treatment induced growth inhibition in all groups (p < 0.05 ; Figure 4A). Figure 4. Proliferation and migration of A549 cells reduced by SHH treatment.

( D) E ect of SHH on cell viability and wound healing increased by M2-CM. SHH were added to A549 cells for 24 h in the presence of M2-CM. Scale bar, 100 \u0016m. Data are shown as the mean \u0006SD of four independent experiments ( n=4). * p<0.05 compared to the control. SHH only treatment did not a ect M0 cell viability, indicating that SHH a ect the viability of A549 cells. In addition, the molecules secreted from M1 and M2 cells (supernatants, conditioned medium (CM)) also induced a decrease and an increase in A549 cell viability, respectively, compared to M0-CM ( p<0.05; Figure 4A). The macrophage CM a ected proliferation and migration of A549 cells. M1-CM reduced A549 cell proliferation and migration, whereas M2-CM increased them. SHH-treated CM dramatically reduced the cell proliferation and migration of A549 cells, like M1-CM did (Figure 4B). Cells treated with M0-CM showed a similar e ect on proliferation and migration ofCancers 2020 ,12, 726 8 of 24 A549 cells compared to the control (THP-1-CM). The three-dimensional (3D) migration assay also showed a decrease and an increase in the treatment with M1-CM and M2-CM, respectively (Figure 4B, bottom panel). The involvement of p38 and STAT3 in proliferation and migration was checked. A combination of M1-CM or SHH and activators (U46619 for p38 and colivelin for STAT3) enhanced cell proliferation and migration, whereas a combination with S3l-201, an inhibitor of STAT3, decreased them, compared to M1-CM or SHH-CM only treatment. However, the p38 inhibitor SB203580 greatly increased cell proliferation and migration. A combination of M2-CM and colivelin increased cell proliferation and migration, whereas a combination of S3l-201 decreased them. Both U46619 and SB203580 reduced cell proliferation and migration, compared to M2-CM only treatment. Colivelin treatment signicantly inhibited SHH's e ect on wound healing, whereas S3l-201 increased its e ect (p<0.05; Figure 4C). However, in cell proliferation and migration, both U46619 and SB203580 reduced the e ect of SHH. The M2-CM-induced increase in cell viability and wound healing was signicantly reduced by the SHH combination ( p<0.05; Figure 4D). These results show that STAT3 was primarily involved in the SHH-induced reduction in the cell proliferation and migration of A549 cells. 2.5. Cytotoxic E ect of SHH on A549 Cells An MTT assay was performed to assess whether SHH exhibit cytotoxicity on A549 cells. Di erent concentrations (1 to 100 \u0016g/mL) of SHH were added to A549 cells for 48 h. SHH treatment signicantly decreased the cell viability of A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner ( p<0.05; Figure 5A). Treatments with 10, 30, 50, and 100 \u0016g/mL SHH reduced cell viability by 16.6%, 29.6%, 39.9%, and 49.5%, respectively (Figure 5A). A low concentration of SHH (1 \u0016g/mL) did not a ect cell viability. In subsequent experiments, the 100 \u0016g/mL SHH that inhibits approximately 50% of cell viability was used. The SHH was added to A549 cells for 7 days. SHH reduced the growth of A549 cells compared to the control in a time-dependent manner. The gap in growth between the control and the SHH treatment increased over time ( p<0.05; Figure 5B). There was also an increase in the number of propium iodide (PI)-positive dead cells in the long-term incubation of SHH (Figure 5C). In addition, the soft agar colony formation and tumor spheroid assays showed that SHH had concentration-dependent tumor suppressive e ects on A549 cells (Figure 5D,E).Cancers 2020 ,12, 726 9 of 24 Cancers 2020, 12, x 9 of 24 Figure 5.

Four independent experiments were performed ( C,D,E; n = 4). To identify the involvement of p38 MAPK and STAT3 in the suppression of the cancer cell growth caused by SHH, p38 and STAT3 activators were added to A549 cells prior to SHH treatment . Colivelin pretreatment significantly restored the cell viability reduced by SHH treatment , whereas U46619 did not inhibit SHH -induced cell death (p < 0.05 ; Figure 6A ). SHH decreased the activity of STAT3 in A549 . The c ombination of colivelin blocked the of wh ile the combination of S3l -201 reduced STAT3 activity dramatically (Figure 6B). Real -time images showed that treatment combined with colivelin reduced SHH 's lytic cell death (Figure 6C). Wound healing was also re stored when SHH and colivelin were combined (Figure 6D). The c olony assay also showed that colivelin cotreatment prevented reduction of A549 cell proliferation (Figure 6E). Doxorubicin used for the treatment of lung cancer and SHH were co -added to A549 cells for 48 h in order to evaluate the effect of SHH for adjuvant chemotherapy . Doxorubicin significant ly caused concentration -dependent cell death. A combination of SHH and doxorubicin significantly enhanced the effect of doxorubi cin on cell death (p < 0.05 ; Figure 6F) .

Four independent experiments were performed ( C,D,E;n=4). To identify the involvement of p38 MAPK and STAT3 in the suppression of the cancer cell growth caused by SHH, p38 and STAT3 activators were added to A549 cells prior to SHH treatment. Colivelin pretreatment signicantly restored the cell viability reduced by SHH treatment, whereas U46619 did not inhibit SHH-induced cell death ( p<0.05; Figure 6A). SHH decreased the activity of STAT3 in A549 cells. The combination of colivelin blocked the inhibition of STAT3, while the combination of S3l-201 reduced STAT3 activity dramatically (Figure 6B). Real-time images showed that treatment combined with colivelin reduced SHH's lytic cell death (Figure 6C). Wound healing was also restored when SHH and colivelin were combined (Figure 6D). The colony formation assay also showed that colivelin cotreatment prevented SHH-induced reduction of A549 cell proliferation (Figure 6E).

SHH -Induced Growth Inhibition of A549 Cells To explore the underlying mechanism by which SHH suppresse s A549 cell growth, the distribution of the cell cycle phase in A549 cells was examined through flow cytometric analysis with PI as a staining agent. Treatment with SHH for 48 h resulted in a dramatic phase arrest of G2/M, whereas the number of cells in phase S and G0/G1 was markedly reduced (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7A, G2/M arrest was restored by the treatment combined with colivelin . SHH treatment increased t he number of cells showing sub -G1, but the sub-G1 population decreased in the combination of SHH and colivelin . The cell fraction showing G2/M arrest in SHH treatment was significantly increased by two -fold (17.7% in control v s. 39.9% in SHH). Colivelin also restored the G2/M arrest ( p < 0.05 ; Figure 7 B).

SHH-treated cells showed an granulation, vacuolization, and membrane blebbing (Figure 8F). These morphological changes were similar to those in necroptotic and pyroptotic cells, which are two pathways of necrotic cell death. They are characterized by plasma membrane rupture, and the pyroptotic and necroptotic membrane damages are related to IL-1 release. SHH induced an increase in the secretion of IL-1 release in A549 cells (Figure 8G). Caspase-1 activity was dramatically increased by SHH treatment (Figure 8H,I), while the activity was decreased in A549 cells treated with Z-YVAD-FMK (a caspase-1 inhibitor) or colivelin The ect of pyroptosis-and necroptosis-related chemicals were evaluated on SHH-induced cell death.

Discussion TAMs , which are abundant in most types of malignant tumors, show an M2 profile . In this study, in TAMs, the expression levels of M2 markers were high (Figure 3E). High infiltrations of M2 in tumor islets and stroma are associated with reduced overall survival in NSCLC [25]. NSCLCs are relatively insensitive to radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy compared to small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) [26]. The d evelopment of anti -cancer agents that reduce M2 function is needed to treat NSCLCs with dru g resistance and malignant tendenc ies. SHH ha ve many benefits for treating lung cancer , namely, M1 activation, M2 suppression, growth inhibition, migration inhibition, and cytotoxicity in cancer cells .

Discussion TAMs, which are abundant in most types of malignant tumors, show an M2 prole. In this study, in TAMs, the expression levels of M2 markers were high (Figure 3E). High inltrations of M2 in tumor islets and stroma are associated with reduced overall survival in NSCLC [ 25]. NSCLCs are relatively insensitive to radiotherapy and /or chemotherapy compared to small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) [ 26]. The development of anti-cancer agents that reduce M2 function is needed to treat NSCLCs with drug resistance and malignant tendencies. SHH have many benets for treating lung cancer, namely, M1 activation, M2 suppression, growth inhibition, migration inhibition, and cytotoxicity in cancer cells. This study demonstrates the e ects of SHH on the regulating macrophages in mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells, mouse primary peritoneal macrophages, a human monocytic cell line THP-1 cell, and human TAMs. M1 markers (iNOS and TNF- ) were upregulated and markers (Arg-1 , IL-6, and TNF- ) and markers (CD206, CD209, bronectin-1, and IL-10). However, the expression pattern of macrophage markers di ered by species and cell type. The mouse M2 marker Arg-1 was not detected in human THP-1-di erentiated M2. SHH intrincically modulated the expression of macrophage markers in human macrophages, but not in mouse macrophages. On the other hand, SHH reduced the expression level of the M2 markers upregulated by IL-4 in mouse primary peritoneal macrophages. RAW264.7 cells predominantly show an M1 phenotype, which does not respond to IL-4 treatment (Figure 1E). As a result, SHH have a regulatory e ect on both mouse and human macrophages.Cancers 2020 ,12, 726 14 of 24 The anticancer e ects of SHH on cell viability, colony formation, and cell cycle distribution were investigated in A549 cells. The e ects were compared to macrophage conditioned medium and doxorubicin. In line with earlier studies, M1 reduced the cell viability and wound healing of A549 cells, whereas M2 enhanced them (Figure 4). SHH reduced the cell viability and wound healing of A549 cells, like M1 did. The anticancer e ect of SHH may be due to M1 activation, which shows high phagocytic ability toward cancer cells, oncolytic ability by protease secretion and inflammasome IL-6, TNF- , and NO. In addition, other molecules are also secreted from activated macrophages. These molecules, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, have the potential to induce lysis in cancer cells through STAT3 inhibition. SHH induces NF- STAT3 and NF- \u0014B crosstalk to promote cancer progression [ 27]. Activation of NF- \u0014B by SHH may reduce the anticancer e ect of SHH itself. Interestingly, however, SHH induces activation of NF- \u0014B and inhibition of STAT3 in macrophages and NSCLC cells. As a result, various inflammatory cytokines secreted from M1 activated by SHH are likely to be involved in the anticancer e ect of SHH through inhibition of STAT3 activation. The cell viability and wound healing were regulated by p38 and STAT3 modulators; thus, p38 and STAT3 are promising targets for chemotherapy. Persistent phosphorylation of p38 and STAT3 has been reported in NSCLC. The constitutive activation of p38 and STAT3 is related to increase in cell proliferation and metastasis in NSCLC [ 28-30], and inhibition of p38 reduces the metastatic potential of NSCLC [ 30,31]. In this study, however, there was no signicant di erence between the p38 activator and inhibitor treatments in the proliferation and migration of cancer cells. On the other hand, STAT3 activator recovered wound healing reduced by SHH, and its inhibitor enhanced SHH's e ect (Figure 4). These results indicate that SHH's anticancer e ects are strongly mediated by low STAT3 activity. In addition, the anticancer e ect of SHH may be due to M2 suppression, which reduces tumor immunosurveillance escape, angiogenesis, and matrix remodelin, is also contributed. p38 inhbition downregulates the activation of M2 markers in mouse peritoneal macrophages [ 15] and the human monocytic cell line U937 32]. signaling polarizes of the IL-6 /STAT3 signaling pathway turns macrophages into M1 [ 34]. In line with previous studies, p38 and STAT3 were involved in the regulation of mouse and human macrophage polarization. The expression levels of the M2 markers downregulated by SHH were restored by p38 and STAT3 activators in mouse, but not in human macrophages. In human macrophages, only STAT3 activator functions on M2 markers reduced by SHH. SHH reduced STAT3 activity in A549 cells, and the combination of the STAT3 activator and SHH reduced the e ect of SHH on STAT3 phosphorylation, cell viability, wound healing, cell growth, colony formation, G2 /M phase arrest, and caspase-1 activation (Figures 4-8). These results indicate that STAT3 is highly involved in SHH-induced suppression of human M2 and cancer cells. SHH enhanced the cytotoxic e ects of doxorubicin in A549 cells. The cytotoxic ect SHH was more specic to NSCLC (A549 and HCC366) compared to breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) (Figure 6). In some NSCLC cells, blockade of STAT3 induces apoptois with the induction of Bax and the reduction of Bcl-2, which prevents cytochrome c release from mitochondria [ 30]. In line with earlier studies, SHH reduced STAT3 activity, increased Bax expression, and decreased Bcl-2 (Figure 7). In addition, SHH induced the upregulation of p21, p27, and p53 downregulation B1. activator attenuated these However, the caspase inhibitor failed to recover SHH-induced cell death. In addition, the apoptosis markers were not a ected by SHH treatment; 3 /7 PARP cleavage, cytochrome C release, and MMP changes. These results suggest that other mechanisms exist. Interestingly, however, SHH-treated cells showed positive signals in Annexin V /PI and TUNEL staining. Annexin V and TUNEL stainings are used for the monitoring of early and late apoptosis, respectively. SHH-treated macrophages showed M1 phenotypes with short spreading, vacuoles, and flat round shape. A549 cells also showed changed phenotypes with membrane blebbing and numerous vacuoles, like activated macrophages. Membrane damageCancers 2020 ,12, 726 15 of 24 and DNase release may explain Annexin V and TUNEL staining in the absence of changes in other apoptotic markers in SHH-treated A549 cells (Figure 8). Necrotic cells stained by PI were also seen in the SHH-treated cells. In addition, SHH-treated A549 cells induced IL-1 caspase-1 activation (Figure 8E). Senescence events and autophagy markers were not consistently detected in SHH-treated A549 cells (Figure 8F). Pyroptosis and necroptosis are mechanisms of regulated cell death distinct from apoptosis. Lytic cell death requires gasdermin D (GSDMD) for pyroptosis mixed lineage kinase pseudokinase for necroptosis. Both GSDMD and MLKL result in IL-1 -driven inflammation, which is from caspase-1 activation [ 35]. Pyroptotic and necroptotic cell death show distinct morphological di erences; reduced cell swelling and flattened cytoplasm in pyroptosis, and cell swelling and subsequent osmolysis in necroptosis. However, both cell death mechanisms have in common that they damage the plasma membrane [ 36,37]. Annexin V staining could not distinguish between apoptosis, pyroptosis, or necroptosis. In this study, SHH-treated cells showed lytic cell death with reduced cell volume, membrane alteration, Caspase-1 activation, and IL-1 secretion. The pyroptotic and necroptotic are undergoing block pyroptosis and necroptosis, inhibited SHH-induced cell death. However, the chemicals were not fully recovered cell death induced by SHH (Figure 8J), indicating that other mechanism may exist in SHH-induced cell death. Several immunotherapies have been widely applied to cancer to inhibit malignant activity or to activate the immune system against the immune evasion mechanism of cancer [ 39-41]. Most natural immune modulators induce M1 or M2 polarization in one direction, but SHH benecially a ect both M1 and M2 polarization in macrophages for treating cancer. Collectively, our results suggest that SHH may be applied as a therapeutic substance for the activation of the immunocompromised environment in relation to cancer progression. A better understanding of the mechanisms and physiological roles of pyroptosis and necroptosis will be able to explain the mechanism by which SHH cause cancer cell death and anti-cancer immune responses. In addition, the e ect of SHH on PD-1 and PD-L1 expression should be investigated in further studies. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Ethical Approval and Chemicals All experiments were performed with the approval of the Ethics Committee and in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Gyeongsang National University (GNU-160811-M0036). Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Stock solutions of colivelin (378 \u0016M; Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 5 mg /mL) were prepared in distilled water. The mouse IL-4 (0.1 mg /mL), human IL-4 (0.1 mg /mL), human IL-13 (0.1 mg /mL), and human IFN- (0.1 mg /mL), which were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), were dissolved in distilled water. Bay 11-7085 (50 mM), necrostatin-1 (20 mg /mL; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), PMA (1 mM), SB203580 (25 mM), S3l-201 TX, USA), (10 CA, USA), and Z-YVAD-FMK (20 mM; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). U-46619 (28.53 mM) was prepared in methyl acetate. The solutions were then diluted in culture medium to the working concentration. An equivalent concentration or volume of solvents was added in the control group. The nal concentrations of DMSO and methyl acetate were ~0.1% ( v/v). 4.2. Preparation of Sea Hare Hydrolysates The preparation of SHH was performed as previously described [ 19]. Briefly , sea hare ( Aplysia kurodai ) was washed, blanched, and minced. Flavourzyme (2%) was directly added to the minced sea hare.Cancers 2020 ,12, 726 16 of 24 The minced sea hare in the enzyme solution was adjusted to pH 6.0 with citric acid powder, incubated at 60\u000eC for 15 h, boiled at 100\u000eC for 10 min to inactivate the enzyme reaction, and then ltered with a 200 mesh screen sieve. The ltered solution was concentrated to Brix 50 using a rotary vacuum evaporator (WCR-P6, Daihan Scientic Co., Ltd, Wonju, Korea). Three volumes of ethanol were added to the concentrated hydrolysates. The hydrolysate solution was stirred and left to stand for 12 h until precipitation. The precipitate was freeze-dried, ground into powder, and stored at \u000070\u000eC until further analysis. At the time of the experiment, the dried materials were dissolved in distilled water at the indicated concentrations. 4.3. Cell Culture and Isolation of Peritoneal Macrophages The RAW264.7 macrophage cell line derived from Abelson murine leukemia virus-induced tumors was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (A549 and HCC-366), human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), and the human monocytic THP-1 cell line were obtained from Korean Cell Line Bank (KCLB, Seoul, Korea). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modied Eagle's medium atmosphere with 5% CO 2at 37\u000eC. The medium was replaced every 2 days. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from C57BL /6 mice (6-week-old, male, n=10) purchased from Koatech Co. (Animal Breeding Center, Pyongtaec, Korea), as previously described [ 42]. Briefly, 1 mL of 3% Brewer thioglycollate broth (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was injected per mouse into the peritoneal cavity. After four days of injection, the peritoneal cells were collected by injecting and aspirating 10 mL PBS from the peritoneum. To evaluate the purity of the isolated macrophages, the peritoneal cells were examined using a flow cytometer, as detailed in Section 4.13. 4.4. Macrophage Polarization and Generation of Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) THP-1 cells (2\u0002105cells/mL) were seeded in a 6-well plate and cultured for 24 h in RPMI medium. The cultured cells were di erentiated into a macrophage-like phenotype by adding 150 nM PMA. After 24 h, the macrophages were polarized into M1 in the presence of 100 ng /mL LPS and 20 ng/mL IFN- for 48 h, or into M2 by adding 20 ng /mL IL-4 and 20 ng /mL IL-13 for 72 h. SHH (100 \u0016g/mL) was treated to M0 alone or in combination with M1 or M2 inducers for 48 h or 72 h. The supernatant of each group was harvested just before media change to prepare the conditioned medium. THP-1-di erentiated macrophages were co-cultured with A549 cells at a 1:1 ratio for 4 days to generate TAMs. 4.5. Cell Viability and Real-time Live Cell Imaging Cell viability was determined procedures were performed as previously described [ 43]. Briefly, cells at the exponential phase were seeded (2\u0002104cells/mL) in a 96-well plate. After treatment with SHH, 10 \u0016L of 5 mg /mL MTT solution was added to each well and incubated for 2 h. The supernatants were then aspirated, the formazan crystals in each well were dissolved in 100 \u0016L of DMSO for 10 min at room temperature, and the plate was read at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Data are expressed as the optical density or percentage of viable cells compared to the control. Real-time live cell imaging was performed using Cell Observer (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Briefly, the cells were seeded at the density of 1.5 \u0002103cells/well on Culture-Insert 2-well (ibidi GmbH, with 5% CO 2at 37\u000eC for 48 h. The cells were treated with 100 \u0016g/mL SHH, colivelin was pretreated for 2 h, and then transferred to the Cell Observer. The cells were maintained at 37\u000eC in 5% CO2. Images were captured at 10 min intervals for 48 h. Cells cultured in the medium without adding SHH were taken as a control.Cancers 2020 ,12, 726 17 of 24 4.6. Live /dead Cell Staining Live/dead cell staining was performed using calcein-AM (Thermo Fisher Scientic, Eugene, OR, USA) and propidium iodide (PI). Viable cells and disordered areas of dead cell membrane were stained with Calcein-AM and PI and appeared green and red, respectively. A549 cells at the density of 5\u0002103cells/100\u0016Lwere cultured on glass-bottomed culture dish (SPL, Pocheon, Korea) for 48 h. The cells were treated with 100 \u0016g/mL of SHH for 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h. The cells were washed twice with free DMEM and then stained with 2 \u0016M calcein-AM and 3 \u0016g/mL PI for 10 min at 37\u000eC. The stained cells were washed three times and observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with lter sets for fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and Texas Red. 4.7. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)\u2014Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Analysis Total RNA from the cells was extracted with Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientic) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA (3 \u0016g) isolated from the RAW264.7 cells, the mouse peritoneal and human THP-1-di erentiated macrophages, and the TAMs using using NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). The quantied cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplication with G- Taqpolymerase (Cosmogenetech, Seoul, Korea). PCR assay was performed with specic primers for M1 and M2 polarization markers. The specic primer sequences are listed in Table 1. The PCR steps included initial denaturation at 94\u000eC for 5 min, then 32 cycles at 94\u000eC for 30 s, 55\u000eC to 60\u000eC (see Table 1) for 30 sec, 72\u000eC for 30 sec, and a nal extension step at 72\u000eC for 10 min. The amplied PCR products were separated in 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The bands obtained by RT-PCR were extracted and directly sequenced with an ABI PRISM\u00ae3100-Avant Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA).Cancers 2020 ,12, 726 18 of 24 Table 1.

The procedures of Western blot analysis were as described previously [ 43]. Briefly, the cell lysates were incubated for 30 min on ice with intermittent vortexing and were claried by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm (22,250 \u0002g; Micro 17TR, Hanil, Incheon, Korea) for 20 min at 4\u000eC. After centrifugation, the supernatant was separated and stored at \u000070\u000eC until use. Protein concentration was quantied using a Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientic, Waltham, MA, USA). Equal amounts (35 \u0016g) of total protein were analyzed among experimenal groups. Equal volumes of the supernatant and 2 \u0002sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample bu er were mixed, loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and separated by electrophoresis for 120 min at 120 V . Then, the gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for 1 h at 100 V using a wet transfer system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free dry Cruz anti- -actin The primary antibody incubation with a secondary peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody at 1:5000 (Assay designs, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Immuno-positive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Dogen, Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 4.9. Phagocytosis Assay The phagocytic ability of macrophages was analyzed using a phagocytosis assay kit (Cayman Chemical) according to a previously described method [ 18]. Briefly, 5\u0002104cells/well RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in a 96-well black-bottomed plate. The cultured cells were stimulated with LPS (1\u0016g/mL) or SHH (1, 10, and 100 \u0016g/mL). Then, 10 \u0016L of the latex beads rabbit IgG FITC solution was added and incubated for 2 h. The cells were washed three times with the assay bu er. The washed cells were analyzed for fluorescence intensity using a fluorescence microplate reader (Tecan, Maennendorf, Switzerland). The phagocytic ability of macrophages was also analyzed through co-culture with A549 cells, which were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in pcDNA3.1 using LipofectAMINE2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientic) and Opti-MEM I (Thermo Fisher Scientic). The A549 cells were added to RAW264.7 cells cultured in a 35 mm cell imaging dish with a glass coverslip bottom, and SHH was added to the dish. Green fluorescence from cells expressing GFP was detected with a confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a fluorescence cells were seeded onto a 24-well culture dish at a density of 2 \u0002105cells/well. Cells were scratched with a sterile pipette tip, washed with PBS, and incubated in fresh medium for 24 h. Another assay was performed using Culture-Insert 2-well (ibidi GmbH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, A549 cell suspension at the density of 66\u0002104cells/mL (70 \u0016L) was seeded into each well, and the cells were incubated for 24 h, then washed three times with free medium. After washing, the cells were captured as the initial images at 0 h. Macrophage conditioned media were added to the cells and incubated for 12 or 24 h at 37\u000eC. Photomicrographs were taken after incubation for the periods indicated. Relative cell migration distance (wound closure) was determined by measuring the wound width on the monolayer using AxioVision 4.5 software under a microscope (Axiovert 40C, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) and by dividing this value from the initial value (i.e., the initial wound width at 0 h). The data acquired from the three scratches on each well were converted to the percentage of wound closure at a given time.Cancers 2020 ,12, 726 20 of 24 The transwell (three-dimensional (3D)) migration assay was performed using the CytoSelect\u0097Cell Migration Assay Kit containing polycarbonate membrane inserts (0.8 \u0016m pore membrane; Cell Biolabs, Inc., CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cell suspension (2\u0002104cells/300\u0016L) in macrophage conditioned media was added to the upper chamber of each insert. The lower chamber contained medium with 10% FBS to allow cell migration toward the lower face of the transwell culture inserts. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37\u000eC in a 95% air\u20145% CO 2gas mixture. Non-migrating cells on the inner side of the transwell culture inserts were gently removed with a cotton-tipped swab. Migrated cells remaining on the bottom surface were stained with a cell-staining solution (0.4% crystal violet) for 10 min at room temperature. Photomicrographs of ve individual elds per insert were taken using a microscope (Axiovert 40C). 4.11. Colony Formation Assay A549 cells at the density of 5 \u0002103/well were seeded in a 6-well plate and grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin /streptomycin. After 24 h, di erent concentrations of SHH were added to the cells for 48 h. The medium was replaced with a fresh medium every 2 days for 14 days.
