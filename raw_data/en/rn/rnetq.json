Thank you to EarthHero for sponsoring this post. All thoughts and opinions are my own. The older I get, the more I want the gifts that I give to be useful. Gone are the days when I might give someone a knick-knack that will sit and collect dust on the shelf. Not only do I love giving gifts that are useful, I want them to be eco-friendly too.
