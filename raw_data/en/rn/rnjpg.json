The notifications are not only harsh but are manifestly arbitrary on the following counts: - I. They fail to consider that the post graduate final year medical students have been extremely occupied due to COVID duty and have hardly had anytime for the preparation for their final examination. It is important to note that ideally the final year PG students used to get a study leave of about 45 days for preparing for their final examination but owing to pandemic duty they have not been given even 1 day for preparation. In such circumst ances the respondents ought to do away with the passing marks i.e. 50 %. II. Their duty towards covid -19 patient be considered while evaluating their practical experience as irrespective of their https://medicaldialogues.in/C stream, the Post Graduate students are being used for covid -19 duties. III. The respondents are extending the academic period of the petitioner beyond the prescribed schedule of 3 years due ongoing pandemic for their services but they are not given any credit for the same. IV. May it be noted that the final examination of the PG resident doctors is a extremely important cornerstone for them as it decides their specialty which is very significant for any doctor. The petitioners are resident doctors pursuing post graduate courses (MD/MS/DM/Diploma) in var ious disciplines of medical science. They have satisfactorily completed their residency of three years and have been in the forefront of our nation's fight against covid. Though they have suffered personally by getting infected and have lost many of their colleagues, but their resolve to fight against this pandemic has gone undeterred. However, the apathy of Respondents in not recognizing their efforts is writ large as they are expected to undertake the final examination without being given enough time for preparation. The issue attains immense importance in backdrop of current pandemic situation wherein https://medicaldialogues.in/D such post graduate medical students/resident doctors who are under no legal obligation to continue giving their services particularly w hen their residency period is admittedly over. As per S. 61 (2) of National Medical Commission Act, the Post Graduate Education Regulation of erstwhile MCI is applicable. The said regulation mandates final examination for conferring a degree, but in the same vein it also mandates time limit for the same. The residency period of three years is already over. Despite being no provision for extension of residency the petitioners are made to extend it without any legal basis. It would not be out of place to me ntion herein that Medical Council of India Post Graduate Medical Education Regulation 2000 (hereinafter referred as PG Regulations) deals with the standards, curriculum and examination of the Post Graduate students. Regulations 14 of the PG Regulations dea ls with examinations. As per the said regulation M.D./M.S. examinations consists of the following: - A. Thesis B. Theory Papers C Clinical/Practical and Oral Examination The petitioners have already submitted their thesis. With regard to the theory papers it is humbly submitted that they all are qualified doctors and they are not getting even one day of preparations while erstwhile https://medicaldialogues.in/E applicants got 45 days of preparation, the theory examination may be exempted. Owing to their continuous s ervice to covid -19 patients their practical experience and clinical inputs cannot be ignored. Moreover, the respondents having exercised their discretion in relaxing the provisions regarding the submission of Postgraduate Thesis owing to the pandemic vide notification dated 22.12.2020 can do away with the examination process and not extend the time period of the courses of the petitioners which is otherwise akin to 'imposed failure'. Recognising the shortage of human resources particularly the doctors, the Prime Minister had recently recommended that the services of Final year resident doctors be extended to ensure adequate manpower to tackle the unprecedented crisis being thrown up by the pandemic. However, the Respondents have failed to realise that PG a nd super specialty courses are for a fixed tenure and extensions are normally handed over as punishment for poor performance or for attendance shortage. It is akin to 'imposed failure', which is very demoralizing for the petitioners. On the top of all this expecting the final year resident doctors to appear in final examination which is admittedly a gruesome exercise and requires tremendous preparation is adding 'salt to the injury' 24.3.2020 The alarming situation of the pandemic led to complete https://medicaldialogues.in/F lockdown of nation September 2020 The first wave of COVID -19 pandemic reached its peak and then the cases started declining 22.12.2020 Recognising the conditions of the Final year PG resident doctors in handling the pandemic, vide notification dated 22.12.2020 Respondent 3 had given relaxation to them in submission of thesis. March, 2021 However, soon the second wave of the pandemic came in a more monstrous form. The entire healthcare system was strained. The second wave of the pa ndemic was ruthless as many people succumbed to it. Many final year post graduate doctors had lost their life, many got infected but that did not deter them from rendering their selfless services since beginning of the pandemic. 22.4.2021 Oblivious of the ground reality of lack of doctors and the fatigue of the existing workforce, Respondent no. 3 vide notification no. NMC/MCI -23(1)/2021 -Med dated 22.4.2021 while permitting the examiners from outside state to participate in the practic al examination through video conferencing directed the universities to decide the https://medicaldialogues.in/G date, time and method of examination taking into consideration the pandemic situation in their area. 27.4.2021 Vide another notification no. NMC/Secy/2021/25 dated 27.4.2021 Respondent no. 3 while Recognising the contribution of Final year PG students in fight against COVID directed continuation of their residency period until fresh batches of PG students joins. 5.5.2021 In this backdrop, the petitioners had represented their grievance to the Respondent no. 3 through their respective association and had interlaia, sought waiver of final examination. However, they have not received any reply. 8.5.2021 As per a news articles in The Times of India on 8.5.2021 in view of the second wave of the pandemic, some of the leading IITs have relaxed the norms for the benefit of students. While IIT -Bombay has extended the deadline for re -exam till June, IIT -Kanpur has allowed a waiver of two courses (out of 40 -45 courses) for graduating students. Apart from relaxing the attendance norms and submission deadlines, IIT -Delhi is allowing students to take the I-grade (an incomplete grade) based on self- https://medicaldialogues.in/H certification (instead of a medical certificate). The I -grade will allow them to take the exam later when their mental and physical condition is better. 9.5.2021 The precarious conditions of the doctors on Covid duty was aptly highlighted in a news article on 9.5.2021 published in 'The Print' whereby it was highlighted that apart from been infected and burnt out, the mental health of healthcare professionals has taken a toll. Admittedly they have been over stretched and cannot f unction on auto - pilot mode. The mental fatigue of the doctors particularly the Final year PG students/residents has been immense. Most of them have been emotionally traumatized and are in PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder). 4.6.2021 Hence this petition https://medicaldialogues.in/1 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA [S.C.R Order XXXVIII Rule 1 and 12(1) (d) and (2)] CIVIL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION Writ Petition (C.)

TO, THE HON'BLE CHIEF JUSTICE AND HIS COMPNANION JUSTICES OF THIS HON'BLE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA. THE HUMBLE PETITION OF THE PETITIONER ABOVENAMED MOST RESPECTFULLY SHOWETH: 1. The petitioners seek to challenge the notifications dated 27.4.2021 and 22.4.2021 issued by Respondent no. 3 whereby on one hand it had advised the medical colleges to further continue taking the services of post graduate Final year medical students/residents to keep up the fight against this pandemic and on the other it had advised the universities to decide the time and method of postgraduate practical final examination taking into consideration https://medicaldialogues.in/9 the pandemic situation in their area. The notifications are not only harsh but are manifestly arbitrary on the following counts: - i. They fail to consider that the post graduate final year medical students have been extremely occupied due to COV ID duty and have hardly had anytime for the preparation for their final examination. It is important to note that ideally the final year PG students used to get a study leave of about 2 months for preparing for their final examination but owing to pandem ic duty they have not been given even 1 day for preparation. The notifications fails to recognize the catastrophic impact of absence of the Final year PG residents in our nationa's fight against Coivd -19 pandemic, if the final exams were to happen. In such circumstances the respondents ought to do away with the passing marks i.e. 50 %. ii. Their duty towards covid -19 patient be considered while evaluating their practical experience as irrespective of their https://medicaldialogues.in/10 stream, the Post Graduate students are be ing used for covid - 19 duties. iii. The respondents are extending the academic period of the petitioner beyond the prescribed schedule of 3 years due ongoing pandemic for their services but they are not given any credit for the same. iv. May it be noted that the final examination of the PG resident doctors is a extremely important cornerstone for them as it decides their specialty which is very significant for any doctor. 2. The petitioners are resident doctors pursuing post graduate courses (MD/MS//Diploma) in various disciplines of medical science. They have satisfactorily completed their residency of three years and have been in the forefront of our nation's fight against covid. Though they have suffered personally by getting infected and have lost many of their colleagues, but their resolve to fight against this pandemic has gone undeterred. https://medicaldialogues.in/11 3. However, the ap athy of Respondents in not recognizing their efforts is writ large as they are expected to undertake the final examination without being given enough time for preparation. The issue attains immense importance in backdrop of current pandemic situation where in such post graduate medical students/resident doctors who are under no legal obligation to continue giving their services particularly when their residency period is admittedly over. 4. The petition is filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India as it impacts the final year post graduate medical students/resident doctors of the entire nation. It raises the following question of law: a) Whether non waiver of final examination of the final year post graduate medical students/resident doctors and conferr ing them degree in the current pandemic situation in the backdrop of their services rendered contravenes Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution particularly, when they have been denied any preparation time owing to their COVID duty? https://medicaldialogues.in/12 b) Whether the Respondents decision of not 'waiving' the final examination of the final year post graduate medical students/resident doctors and not evaluating them on the basis of past record/covid duty is harsh and manifestly arbitrary thereby contravenin g the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution? c) Whether under the provisions of Disaster Management Act the Central Government can issue mandatory directions to Respondent no. 3 for waiving the final exam ination of post graduate medical students? 5. FACTS CONSTITUTING CAUSE OF ACTION: i Our nation has been grappling with COVID -19 pandemic since February, 2020. The alarming situation of the pandemic led to complete lockdown of nation on 24.3.2020. First time in our Nation's illustrious history, the lockdown eventually led to the closure of courts too. ii The first wave of COVID -19 pandemic reached its peak in September 2020 and then the cases started declining. https://medicaldialogues.in/13 iii However, soon the second wave of the pandemic came in a more monstrous form. The entire healthcare system was strained. The second wave of the pandemic was ruthless as many people succumbed to it. Many final year post graduate doctors had lost their life, many got infected but that did not deter them from rendering their selfless services since beginning of the pandemic. iv In a research paper published in Indian Journal of Medical Sciences which assessed presence of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia experienc ed by the Indian healthcare worker during pandemic, it was found that Among the doctors working for the pandemic, around 55% of medical officers in the study reported having moderate levels of depression. With respect to anxiety, it was found that among men as many as 52% reported experiencing severe anxiety and 24% had moderate levels of anxiety whereas females reported as high as 68% and 48% of moderate and severe anxiety, respectively. It was also found that around 30% and 44% of male doctors reported mild and moderate levels of stress, respectively, whereas 70% and 56% of female doctors reported mild and moderate levels of stress, respectively. It was also https://medicaldialogues.in/14 observed that among female doctors the rates of moderate insomnia were especially h igh (65%), whereas a high level of male participants reported sub -threshold insomnia (52%).

(Pg. 95 to 101) v Recognising the conditions of the Final year PG resident doctors in handling the pandemic, vide notification dated 22.12.2020 Respondent 3 had given rela xation to them in submission of thesis. A true copy of the notification dated 22.12.2020 by Respondent no. 3 is annexed herewith as Annexure -P/2. (Pg. 102 ). vi It would not be out of place to mention herein that Medical Council of India Post Graduate Medic al Education Regulation 2000 (hereinafter referred as PG Regulations) deals with the standards, curriculum and examination of the Post Graduate students. Regulations 14 of the PG Regulations deals with examinations. As per the said regulation M.D./M.S. examinations consists of the following: - https://medicaldialogues.in/15 A. Thesis B. Theory Papers C Clinical/Practical and Oral Examination vii The petitioners have already submitted their thesis. With regard to the theory papers it is humbly submitted that they all are qualified doctors and they are not getting even one day of preparations while erstwhile applicants getting two months of preparation, the theory examination may be exempted. Owing to their continuous service to covid -19 patients their practical experienc e and clinical inputs cannot be ignored. viii The respondents having exercised their discretion in relaxing the provisions regarding the submission of Postgraduate Thesis owing to the pandemic vide notification dated 22.12.2020 can do away with the examinati on process and not extend the time period of the courses of the petitioners which is otherwise akin to 'imposed failure'. ix As per S. 61 (2) of National Medical Commission Act, the Post Graduate Education Regulation of erstwhile MCI is applicable. The said r egulation mandates final examination for conferring a degree, but in the same vein it also mandates time limit for the same. The residency period of three years is already over. https://medicaldialogues.in/16 Despite being no provision for extension of residency the petitioners are made to extend it without any legal basis. x It is well known fact that India ranks very badly in health infrastructure (110 out of 141 countries). The number of doctors for every 10,000 people in India has fallen to around nine in 2019 from 12 in 1991, according to data on World Health Organization's website, while the country's health expenditure was just 3.54% of GDP, lower than countries including Iraq, Afghanistan, Egypt, China and Kenya. xi Oblivious of the ground reality of lack of doctors and the fatigue of the existing workforce, Respondent no. 3 vide notification no. NMC/MCI -23(1)/2021 -Med dated 22.4.2021 while permitting the examiners from outside state to participate in the practical examination through video conferencing directed t he universities to decide the date, time and method of examination taking into consideration the pandemic situation in their area. A true copy notification no. NMC/MCI -23(1)/2021 - Med dated 22.4.2021 issued by Respondent Respondent no. 3 while Recognising the contribution https://medicaldialogues.in/17 of Final year PG students in fight against COVID directed continuation of their residency period until fresh batches of PG students joins. A true copy notification no. NMC/Secy/2021/25 dated 27.4.2021 issued by Respondent no. -P/4. (Pg.104 ) xiii Recognising the shortage of human resources particularly the doctors, the Prime Minister had recently recommended that the services of Final year resident doctors be extended to ensure adequate manpower to tackle the unprecedented crisis being thrown up by the pandemic. However, the Respondents have failed to realise that PG courses are for a fixed tenure and extensions are normally handed over as punishment for poor performance or for attendance shortage. It is akin to 'imposed failure', which is very de moralizing for the petitioners. On the top of all this expecting the final year resident doctors to appear in final examination which is admittedly a gruesome exercise and requires tremendous preparation is adding 'salt to the injury'. xiv In this backdrop, the petitioners had represented their grievance to the Respondent no. 3 through their respective association and had interlaia , sought waiver of final examination. However, https://medicaldialogues.in/18 they have not received any reply. A true copy of the letter dated nil by Karnataka Association of Resident Doctors 1 to Respondent no. 3 is annexed herewith as Annexure -P/5. (Pg. 105-107) A true copy of the letter no. RDA/21/05 dated 5.5.2021 by Resident Doctors Association, Haryana to Respondent no. 3 is annexed herewith as Annexure -P/6. (Pg. 108 -109) xv It is important to note that as per a news articles in The Times of India on 8.5.2021 in view of the second wave of the pandemic, some of the leading IITs have relaxed the norms for the benefit of students. While I IT-Bombay has extended the deadline for re -exam till June, IIT -Kanpur has allowed a waiver of two courses (out of 40 -45 courses) for graduating students. Apart from relaxing the attendance norms and submission deadlines, IIT -Delhi is allowing students to t ake the I -grade (an incomplete grade) based on self -certification (instead of a medical certificate).

(Pg. 110 to 112) https://medicaldialogues.in/19 xvi The precarious conditions of the doctors on Covid duty was aptly highlighted in a news article on 9.5.2021 published in 'The Print' whereby it was highlighted tha t apart from been infected and burnt out, the mental health of healthcare professionals has taken a toll. Admittedly they have been over stretched and cannot function on auto -pilot mode. The mental fatigue of the doctors particularly the Final year PG students/residents has been immense. Most of them have been emotionally traumatized and are in PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder). A true copy of the report dated 9.5.2021 published in 'The Print' is annexed herewith as Annexure -P/8. (Pg. 113 - 116) xvii Since the pandemic is likely to continue and the resident doctors have hardly been given any time for preparation of their final exams it is extremely harsh on the part of the Respondents to expect them to appear for final exam. The continuous requiremen ts of the petitioners in fight against COVID 19 pandemic brings no time and space for conduction of final exams for them. xviii It is worthwhile to mention here that recognising the shortage of human resource particularly the doctors many countries in https://medicaldialogues.in/20 Europe like Italy, UK, Germany etc had fast tracked the medical students into service by scrapping their service in an attempt to boost health systems. xix In this backdrop, the petitioners had represented their grievance to the Respondent no. 3 through their respective association and had interlaia , sought waiver of final examination. However, they have not received any reply. A true copy of the letter dated 25.5.2021 by Telangana Junior Doctors Association to Respondent no. 3 is annexed herewith as Annexure -P/9. (Pg. 117 -118) 10. The petitioners do not have any other statutory and other effective legal remedy other than to file this petition. Moreover, the issue raised in this petition relates to the entire nation due to which the petitioner has approached this Hon'ble Court under Article 32 of the Constitution. 11. There is no civil, criminal or revenue litigation involving t he petitioner which has or could have any legal nexus with the issues involved in this petition. https://medicaldialogues.in/21 12. That the issue raised in this petition was neither dealt with nor decided by a Court of law at the instance of the petitioner or to the best of his knowledge, at the instance of any other person. 13. Thus being aggrieved and/or dissatisfied by such arbitrary, illegal, unreasonable action on the part of the Respondent the petitioner begs to move this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of In dia before this Hon'ble Court, inter alia, on the following grounds amongst other: 14. G R O U N D S a) Because non waiver of final examination of the final year post graduate medical students/resident doctors and not conferring them degree without final exams in the current pandemic situation contravenes Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution particularly, when they have been denied any preparation time owing to their COVID duty. It is important to note that preparation for final examinations requires undivided attention of the students which could hinder their services towards Covid care, and vice versa. https://medicaldialogues.in/22 b) Because the Respondents decision of not 'waiving' the final examination of the post graduate medical students and not evaluating them based on past record/covid duty is harsh and manifestly arbitrary thereby contravening the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution. c) Because under the provisions of Disaster Management Act the Central Government can issue mandatory directions to Respondent no. 3 for waiving the final examination of post graduate medical students and evaluating them based on the past record and Covid duty. d) Because this Hon'ble Court in exercise of its Writ Jurisdiction can issue necessary directions to the Respondents as the law/regulations is silent on a vital question of fundamental rights. It is important to note that under S. 61 (2) of National Medical Commission Act, the Post Graduate Education Regulation of erstwhile MCI is applicable. The said regulation mandates final https://medicaldialogues.in/23 examination for conferring a degree, but in the same vein it also mandates time limit for the same. The residency period of three years is already over. Despite being no provision for extension of residency the petitioners are made to extend it without any legal basis. e) Because conferring degree to post graduate residents doctors would add to the pool of healthcare personnel as conferment of degree can be subjected to rendering of compulsory COVI D duty by resident doctors for a fixed time frame. Many nations across the world had fast tracked the induction of the medical students in the healthcare system in their fight against COVID -19 pandemic. f) Because the post graduate resident doctors being tr ained and experienced doctors can be very handy in our nation's fight against the pandemic. It is important to note that only adding health care infrastructure will not solve the paradox of strained healthcare system. Such infrastructure must be managed by qualified doctors else they would be futile. https://medicaldialogues.in/24 g) Because in the face of a pandemic like Covid -19, it is incumbent upon the Respondents, as their fundamental duty, to frame sustainable and effective policies, which looks after the interest of the post graduate resident doctors who have given their everything in fight against pandemic. h) Because the state being a custodian of welfare of citizen, cannot be a silent spectator to injustice meted out to post graduate medical students who h ave given their services selflessly till date. i) Because the petitioners can be awarded an MD/MS degree based on their clinical acumen of the residents which has been proved efficiently by them during ongoing pandemic. Moreover, there are considerable propor tion of residents who would be covid positive already and thus, unable to sit for the exams due to ill health or prepare for the exams effectively while discharging Covid duties. It will also lead to mental agony and may result in depression in these resident doctors many of whom, already have had to deal https://medicaldialogues.in/25 with the physical and mental exhaustion of Covid duties and losing their near and dear ones. j) Because the petitioners have not shied away from their duty of treating a highly infectious disease and thus, the Respondents must recognise their sacrifices and should act in a way which should further their career. k) Because the petitioners having already submitted their thesis, with regard to the theory papers it is humbly submitted that they are all qualified doctors and they are not getting even one day of preparations while erstwhile applicants getting two months of preparation, the theory examination may be exempted. Owing to their continuous service to covid -19 patients their pra ctical experience and clinical inputs cannot be ignored. l) Because the respondents having exercised their discretion in relaxing the provisions regarding the submission of Postgraduate Thesis owing to the pandemic vide notification dated 22.12.2020 can do away with the examination process and not extend the time https://medicaldialogues.in/26 period of the courses of the petitioners which is otherwise akin to 'imposed failure'. m) Because this Hon'ble Court can seek the assistance of expert - panels, Commissi oners, Advisory -committees, Amici etc. to render justice!! A fruitful reference may be made to Sheela Barse vs. Union of India & Ors. (1988) 4 SCC 226 wherein this Hon'ble had held: \"12 The pattern of relief need not necessarily be derived logically from the rights asserted or found. More importantly, the court is not merely a passive, disinterested umpire or onlooker, but has a more dynamic and positive role with the responsibility for the organisation of the proceedings, moulding of the relief and -this is important --also supervising the implementation thereof. The Court is entitled to, and often does seek the assistance of expert -panels, Commissioners, Advisory - committees, Amici etc.\" 15. MAIN PRAYER In the above facts and circumstances it is most humbly prayed that your lordships would most graciously be pleased to pass the following orders : https://medicaldialogues.in/27 1. Issue writ of mandamus directing the respondents to, issue necessary directions waiving the final examination of final year post graduate medica l residents. 2. Issue appropriate writ(s)/directions(s) for promoting the petitioners as senior residents and post -doctoral students as soon as the scheduled tenure completion of three or two years (whichever applicable) along with pay scale and other allowan ces. 3. Issue appropriate writ(s)/directions(s) for constitution of a joint expert committee for examining and recommending on the prayers of this petition and its recommendations, shall be binding on all the respondents. 4.

The aim of the study was to assess the presence of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia experienced by the Indian healthcare workers. Material and Methods: A cross -sectional study was conducted in India among 777 doctors to evaluate the mental health of doctors working in Corona wards from April 2020 to May 2020 using a pre -designed, pre - tested validated, semi -struct ured DASS -21 questionnaire, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Continuous variables between the groups were measured using the Mann -Whitney U-test and the Kruskal -Wallis H test. Results: Among the doctors working for the pandemic, around 55% of medical officers in the study reported having moderate levels of depression. With respect to anxiety, it was found that among men as many as 52% reported experiencing severe anxiety and 24% had moderate levels of anxiety whereas females reported as high as 68% and 48% of moderate and severe anxiety, respectively. In our study, around 30% and 44% of male doctors reported mild and moderate levels of stress, respectively, whereas 70% and 56% of female doctors reported mild and moderate levels of stress, respectively. It was also observed that among female doctors the rates of moderate insomnia were especially high (65%), whereas a high level of male participants reported sub-threshold insomnia (52%). Conclusion: Early screening targeting the medical workforce and the implementation of psychological interventions is essential for protecting and maintaining the functionality of the health -care system. Keywords: Pandemic, Corona virus disease -19, Mental health, Healthcare workers, Depression, Anx iety https://medicaldialogues.in/96 Selvaraj, et al.: A multicentric cross -sectional study was done to find out the psychological impact of COVID -19 pandemic on health -care professionals in India Member States have revealed 3,019,961 cases, an aggregate of 58,162 deaths in the locale, and 2,162,165 recovered cases.[2] The World Health Organization has announced COVID -19 a Global Public Health Crisis.[3] It has not only bought life to a standstill personally and professionally, but has also cast its impact on the psychological well -being of everyone around the globe thereby hampering the psychological resilience and coping abilities of individuals. This has presented the health - care systems worldwide with a novel and catastrophic risk for which presently no breakthrough has been discovered leading to further anxiety and fear of this never ending uncertainty. Doctors and nurses who are considered as the front liners for dealing with this pandemic at point blank range are the most vulnerable to develop mental health concerns. The gruelling working schedule amidst pandemic has predisposed them to witness psychological distress while providing direct care to the p atients, being informed about the spike in cases or due to the mandatory requirements of isolation or quarantine.[4-6] Paradoxically, those treating and helping others are in the greatest need of psychological help something which is currently not availabl e in full swing due to their continuous working hours and lack of self -care. Some even distance themselves emotionally alongside social isolation with the fear of either contracting or spreading this infection to their loved ones which, in turn, fuels anxiety, hypertension, stress, panic, uncertainty, apprehension, phobia, depression, insomnia etc. It is seen that during such periods of disturbances, ones coping styles, cognitive, affective, and behavioral expressions to the pandemic plays a major role in determining one's emotional and psychological health. Innumerable factors directly and indirectly affect the psychological health including the stigma the medical staff faces, social ostracism faced by some, juggling between personal and profession al lives, overburdening of work, and experiencing burnout due to increased pressure, lack of safety equipment such as PPE and masks, and trauma of watching large number of patients dying alone in the isolation ward, among other factors. Notably, working exhaustively may not imply that these health -care staff is immune to psychological effects. They may have similar level of vicarious traumatization as that of general public.[7] The aforementioned is relatable to their increasing concerns for patien ts with disease, colleagues at risk, their families, and themselves.[7] The shortage of health -care facilities and no proven vaccine makes this situation even grimmer. The discovery of COVID -19 requires time and is even costly. Hence, healthcare workers a re not getting tested due to cost incurred.[8] As of August 10, 2020, in India average of 18.36 COVID -19 tests are performed per 1 million population.[1] Many healthcare workers have been infected and lost their lives due to coronavirus. Recently, Bacillus Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) has been hypothesized as a potential protection from COVID -19. Cross -protection against COVID -19 by the BCG immunization has been speculated in India.[9] Coronavirus has the potential of instilling a sense of fear among other health -care professionals regarding their own lives. The current norm of social distancing also conflicts with their professional duty to treat others and also at the same time to maintain their own personal well -being.[10] Such kin d of a cognitive dissonance can also lead to heightened levels of stress, worry, anxiety, depression, and reduced sleep, among other various issues that can take a toll on their psychological health. A 360 degree shift in the present lifestyle further fuels stress and anxiety thereby depleting the psychological resilience even lower than what currently it is. This psychological pandemic at the global level needs particular attention. We aimed to assess the presence of psychological distress, depression , anxiety, stress, and insomnia experienced by the healthcare workers in India related to COVID -19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS A multicentric cross -sectional study was conducted in India to evaluate the mental health of doctors working in COVID -19 wa rds from April 2020 to May 2020. Institute ethical committee approval was obtained for this study. A pre -designed, pre -tested validated semi -structured questionnaire was administered to the study subjects wherein objectives were explained, respectively. The questionnaires were prepared in the format of a Google document which was sent across through social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and various social platforms where doctors are involved, e -mails, etc., to follow the restric tions and protocols of social distancing. Informed consent was taken from the respondents before the study and an option to terminate was made available anytime they desired in the form itself. Complete confidentiality of the respondents was ensured and no personal details were recorded for the purpose of the study such as name, address, and contact details. Participants doctors were targeted in this study. The target sample size of participants was determined using the formula N= Z2P(1 P)/ d2, in w hich = 0.05 and Z = 1.96, and the estimated acceptable margin of error for proportion d was 10%. The proportion of doctors with psychological comorbidities was estimated at 24.3%, based on a previous study outbreak.[11] The calculated sample size is 707, adding 10% non -response rate the final sample size is 777. Demographic details were reported by the participants, including age, gender (male, female, and other), present work area (government teaching/non -teaching hospital/institute, private teaching/non -teaching hospital/institute, private practice, and not working currently), primary specialty, any Indian Journal of Medical Sciences Article in Press | 2 https://medicaldialogues.in/97 Selvaraj, et al.: A multicentric cross -sectional study was done to find out the psychological impact of COVID -19 pandemic on health -care professionals in India pre-existing conditions (hypertension, diabetes, asthma, etc.), and habits (smoking, alcohol consumption, etc.), if the participants were residing with children < 3 years or with the elderly >65 years. Participants were also asked if they are exposed to COVID -19 patients/COVID -19 samples and their current postings in the COVID hospital. Instruments The online survey collected the information of the study variables of depression, stress, anxiety, and insomnia using the DASS -21 questionnaire and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). The DASS -21 scale is a self -report measure that is frequently used to assess the emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress. Eac h of these three scales within DASS contains seven items. The scale of depression assesses feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest and pleasure, dysphoria, self -deprecation, etc. The anxiety scale measures autonomic arousal, subjective, situational aspe cts of anxiety, etc. The stress scale assesses aspects such as inability to relax, being easily upset or irritated, and being impatient or over reactive. It is a self-rated Likert scale with scores of 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (mostly applied to me) in the past 1 week. The final score for the shorter version is multiplied by two to obtain the cumulative score.[12] The ISI consists of seven questions which are added together to get a final score. For each question specific Likert s cale is provided ranging between scores 0 and 4. The appropriate score is to be selected based on severity of insomnia experienced in the past 2 weeks. The scores are interpreted according to the scoring guidelines ranging from 0 to 7 indicating no clinically significant insomnia to 22 -28 indicating clinical insomnia (severe level).[13] Statistical analysis Statistical software used to analyze data were MS Excel, SPSS for Windows Inc. Version 22. Chicago, Illinois. Descriptive statistics were reported as median and interquartile range for continuous variables, frequencies (percentage) for categorical variables. Proportions were compared using Chi -square test. Continuous variables between the groups were measured using Mann -Whitn ey U -test and Kruskal -Wallis H test. Multiple logistic regressions were used to find the predictors of mental health outcome. Error bar plot and Box and Whisker plot were used to depict median scores. For all comparisons, P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS The study was conducted among 777 medical doctors. Out of which 538 doctors had exposure to COVID -19 patients. The mean age of the respondents (n = 538) was 32.07 \u00b1 7.94 years. Out of 777 responding participants, we have got 538 participants directly working with COVID -19 patients. Maximum number of response rate individuals was seen in the age group of 20-30 years and 31-40 years. Around 54.7% of males are working in COVID -19 wards. Among our study participants, 8.7% use alcohol, 2.8% are smokers, and 5.4% are indulged in both. Around 71% of our study group is working in a tertiary care center while remaining 29% in a secondary care center. In our study, around 52% are working in a government set up and 48% in a private set up. Among the COVID -19 exposure participants in our study, 34% are professors working in a teaching institution, 42% working as residents, and 24% as medical officers, respectively. Table 1 shows the association of ISI with demographic variables among our study participants. Severe and moderate insomnia were more commonly seen among females, those working at secondary care centers, working at private institutions, and among medical officers. All the factors were significantly associated with an increase in scores in ISI scale. Table 2 shows depression and anxiety to be significantly associated with COVID -19 exposed participants in our study. Moderate depression as a feature is present more commonly among females (60%) and was found to be statistically significant. Mild depression was seen more among those working at tertiary care centers (51.1%), while moderate depression was seen more commonly among those working at tertiary and secondary care centers and was found significant. Mild depression was seen more among those working at te rtiary care centers (51.1%), while moderate depression was seen more commonly among those working at tertiary and secondary care centers and was found significant. Moderate depression was seen more commonly among medical officers (55%) and was found to be statistically significant. Severe anxiety is seen more among males (52.2%), whereas moderate anxiety more commonly seen among females (67.5%). In our study, 56.5% working at tertiary care hospitals subjected to COVID -19 were having severe anxiety. Medica l officers and residents were more likely to have moderate and severe anxiety levels than others and were found to be statistically significant. Stress factor did not show any significant difference in our study. Table 3 shows the median and interquartile range of all the scores subjected to COVID -19 exposed participants. Depression, anxiety, and stress scores (DASS) were significantly higher among females, 5.0 (2.0 -8.0) versus 6.0 (2.0 -10.0) versus 3.0 (1.0 -8.0); P < 0.001. Among those working at secondary care centers had a significantly higher DASS scores, 4.0 (2.0 -8.0) versus 6.0 (2.0 -10.0) versus 3.0 (0.0-8.0); P < 0.001. In our study, there was no significant difference in DASS with respect to working environm ent.

Graph 2 shows error bar plot featuring the DASS score over ISI. Severe clinical insomnia scores were associated with higher DASS. DISCUSSION The results of our study revealed a 40.4% and 40% prevalence of mild and moderate depression, respectively, among male doctors and 59.6% and 60% of mild and moderate depression, respectively, among female doctors during COVID -19 pandemic. Around 55% of medical officers in the study reported having moderate levels of depression. A study conducted in Korea among 64 doctors indicated a depression rate of nearly 27% during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak.[14] In our study, with respect to anxiety it was found that among men as many as 52% reported experienc ing severe anxiety and 24% had moderate levels of anxiety whereas females reported as high as 68% and 48% of moderate and severe anxiety, respectively. This indicates an alarmingly high number of healthcare workers experiencing mental overload during this time of uncertainty reiterating the fact that the frontline workers are indeed the worst hit by the pandemic. Anxiety rates were higher especially among the resident doctors and the medical officers [Table 3]. A study on the mental health of general publi c was conducted in China which reported moderate to severe levels of depression, stress, and anxiety (16.5%, 8.1%, and 28.8%, respectively) among the respondents. Such increased rates of reported problems even in general public in turn indicates how the frontliners are at even greater risk to experience mental health problems during this crucial time.[15,16] Graph 1: Box and whisker plot showing scores of depression, anxiety, stress and insomnia index ( n=538) Outbreak of COVID -19 has led to a sudden shift in the workforce behavior around the globe posing immense burden on the health -care system. In our study, around 30% and 44% male doctors reported mild and moderate level of stress, respectively, whereas 70% and 56% female doctors reported mild and moderate level of stress, respectively, again indicating an increase in the stress levels being experienced by the health -care staff during this time. Stress rates were especially h igh among professors and medical officers [Table 3]. A study conducted in China to assess the psychological impact of COVID -19 on medical workforce reported the participants ( n = 2299) to be twice at risk of depression, fear, and anxiety by working in close contact with the infected patients.[17] It was observed in our study that among female doctors the rates of moderate insomnia were especially high (65%), whereas high level of male participants Indian Journal of Medical S ciences Article in Press | 4 https://medicaldialogues.in/99 Selvaraj, et al.: A multicentric cross -sectional study was done to find out the psychological impact of COVID -19 pandemic on health -care professionals in India Indian Journal of Medical Sciences Article in Press | 5 Graph 2: Error bar plot featuring the DASS score over Insomnia index severity ( n=538) reported sub threshold insomnia (52%). As many as, 57% females reported severe insomnia. With the increase in working hours, shortage of manpower and acute burden on healthcare infrastructure, it is bound to have a downward spiral effect on those who are tirelessly battling with this ever increasing problem. The residents and the medical officers are worst hit by this issue [Table 2]. Early reports of COVID -19 and from the previous outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, 2003) depict that the healthcare workers are highly prone to experiencing stress, fear, depression, insomnia, and anxiety.[6] This is true for the workers directly engaged in diagnosing, treating, and providing care to suspected or confirmed cases of COVID -19. Another similar observational study involving 180 medical staff dealing directly with COVID -19 patients showed substantial effect of stress and anxiety on the sleep quality and levels of self -efficacy. Indeed, escalation in social support acts as a buffer against stress and anxiety by lowering its level.[18] No Indian studies have been conducted in the area of COVID -19 like the present study by studying all these variables in conjunction. It is agonizing to report that an increasing number of suicides have been rep orted worldwide especially among the general public. Similar instance was reported in India on February 12, 2020 at first.[19] Recent findings add to the reporting of two more similar suicidal cases in India and brings out the turmoil of this avalanching p andemic condition.[20] These incidences have been increasing among the healthcare workers as well all over the world due to the increasing demand and reliance on the medical professionals with an added burden where they have the responsibility to take decision of someone else's Table 2: Distribution of severity of depression, anxiety, and stress among participants respondents to COVID -19 individuals ( n=538).

There is an increased risk of experiencing cumulative trauma or vicarious trauma when working with huge number of patients daily during such a crisis.[7] The COVID -19 mental health concerns can be classified in acute phase (approximately 2 -6 months after the outbreak) which includes immediate psychological issues such as anxiety, fear dissociative symptoms, substance withdrawal, and denial and long -term phase (after the control of the outbreak, >6 months) which includes depr ession, grief, and relapse of pre -existing mental health issues.[21] Therefore, consistent commitment is needed by the mental health professionals even after the pandemic is over. Our study shows that participants treating COVID -19 patients had increased r isk of insomnia, with severe and moderate insomnia more commonly seen in females. Furthermore, statistically significant moderate depression was present commonly among females (60%). Severe anxiety was common in males (52.2%) and moderate anxiety was commo nly seen in females (67.5%). A similar online survey in China concluded that medical healthcare workers were more prone to developing insomnia, anxiety, depression, obsessive -compulsive, and traumatization disorders as compared to their non -medical counter parts.[11] Taking into consideration the mammoth impact of this pandemic, it is essential that mental healthcare should be the primary focus along with the medical care provided. Telecounselling and psychotherapy are the need of the hour. In a time that w arrants social distancing to be maintained, it is essential to equip the frontliners with how to do meditation, breathing and other relaxation techniques such as the Jacobson Progressive Muscle Relaxation. Supportive psychotherapy, mindfulness techniques , psychoeducation, activity scheduling, grief counseling, and sleep hygiene are some of the ways that can ensure the mental sanity of the healthcare workers during this overwhelming time. A team of trained personnel's should be made available for quick assessment of the psychological issues and its remediation. The daunting impact of the pandemic can also be contained by the process of debriefing and catharsis promoted by team members especially during unfortunate outcomes such as increased death cou nt. The existing health -care system should be boosted in the coming times to push forward the psychological care of everyone for a better and more robust future. The information obtained from self -reported questionnaires was not verified with responder 's medical records. Furthermore, currently, India is in the midst of the pandemic and the delayed psychological outcomes related to COVID -19 are difficult to capture with the current survey. Hence, this may limit the generalizability of the findings. CON CLUSION The impact that this pandemic is casting over the mental health of the healthcare workers should not be overlooked today and even in the coming times when the crisis is over. It is suggestive of high need for psychological support and interventions for maintaining a robust clinical workforce. Early screening targeting the medical workforce and implementation of psychological interventions are essential for protecting and maintaining the functionality of the health -care system.

The Postgraduate Medical Education Board (PGMEB) of the National Medical Commission after having carefully considered all the requests, the current COVID 19 pandemic situation and the training requirements of the Postgraduate degree students, has decided as under: 1. The sub -olause 14 (4) (a) of the Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations with regard to the submission of the Postgraduate lhesis states as follows : \"Thesis shall be submitted at least six months before the Zheory and Clinical / Practical examination\". In view of the COVID 19 pandemic the PGMEB has decided to relax the said portion of the regulation and allow the Postgraduate degree students of batches 2018 -19 and 2019 -20 only, to submit their thesis at least three months before the Theory and Clinical/Practical examination. 2. Further sub -clause 13.9 of the Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations states as follows: \"A postgraduate student of a Postgraduate degree course in broad specialities/super specialities would be required to present one poster presentation, to read one paper at a nationaUstate conference and to present one research paper which should be published/accepted for publication/sent for publication during the perlod of his Postgraduate studies so as to make him eligible to appear at the Postgraduate degree examination.\" In view of the COVID 19 pandemic, the PGMHB has decided to relax the said portion of the regulation and allow the Postgraduate students of batches 2018 -19 only,in broad specialities/super specialities to be eligible to appear for their Postgraduate degree examinations even if they have not made a poster presentation, read a paper at a conference or submitted a research paper for publication. 3. Further, in view of dearth of clinical material during current COVID 19 Pandemic, the Universities and Medical colleges/institutions are also advised that while evaluating the thesis submitted for acceptance for the batches 2018 -19 and 2019 -20, final sample size actually analyzed may be considered even if it is less than the committed sample size in the approved thesis protocol for the study. https://medicaldialogues.in/ ANNEUXURE -14, -8, , -1, -77 Pocket - 14, Sector - 8, Dwarka, Phase \u2014 1, New Delhi -77 Nat1onaI Medical Commission Graduate Medical Education 22.04 -2021 The Postgraduate Medical Education Board has received mails from Universities and Institutions about thc issues thcy are facing in conducting Practic.a1 Examinations in Postgraduate CouTses due to the prevailing pandernic.

Need for the letter: With reference to the information as per the order No. Z. 20015/43/2021 - ME-I (FTS - 8108321) dated 3rd May 2021, 2021 an atmosphere of apprehension and unrest about the future academic and career prospects has been created in an already prevailing anxious environment among the final year Post Graduates who were supposed to appear for the university examination on 11th June. Our grievances: A. As Post graduates have been deemed capable of managing covid pandemic amidst various drawbacks and have performed it with utmost professionalism and due diligence, one time exemption from post graduate university examination. Examination at the peak of the pandemic brings \"Work -Academics dilemma\" among the Post Graduates. In case however the authorities feel the dire need to conduct exams, they can consider Exit examination in the form of a. One day Internal assessment/ examination at Institute level b. One day Viva voce and OSCEs at Institute level focusing mainly on practical a spects Waive off of examination https://medicaldialogues.in/KARNATAKA ASSOCIATION OF RESIDENT DOCTORS 106 (KARD) (Association of House surgeons, Post graduates and Super speciality residents of Govt.

Consideration for SR ship (MD/MS Completion) from May 1st 2021: Resident doctors at Karnataka have joined post-graduation from the first week of May 2018, which makes April 30th being the last day to work as Junior Resident (3 years duration tenure) following which resident doctors should be considered as Senior residents. Roles, responsibilities and pay should be that of a senior resident from May 1st 2021, irrespective of the status of the exams. Irrespective of the exams (preferably waived off) and circumstances or pattern of exams, Senior Residency MUST be considered from May 1st 2021. For a) In -service, b) Sponsored candidates, c) Bond exempted candidates, for whom SRship may not apply, they should get a certificate/letter/memora ndum mentioning having \"COMPLETED MD/MS COURSE SUCCESSFULLY\" which would again imply from May 1st 2021 allowing them to provisionally register their degree at the earliest. C. Modification in Bond Enforcement applicable at Karnataka: In view of Medical Colleges already being made to continue their work even beyond three years period stating the pandemic, they should be allowed to continue working in their respective Institutes even to complete their bond duration. Considering 4 years tenure (3 for PG and 1 for work under bond), go vt cannot extend our work beyond April 30th 2022. Bond duration period should not extend beyond April 30th 2022. D. Remainder of other demands: Risk Allowance from March 2019, Fee waive off, recruiting adequate health staffs and doctors, adequate facilities f or isolation and quarantine and also reservation of beds for parent and resident doctors and other demands which Karnataka Association of Resident Doctors has already asked on various occasions to be implemented without fail. NMC being the Governing body f or implementation of Medical education throughout the nation and is also obliged to take care of the needs of the Resident Doctors and need to ensure the smooth implementation of policies. Kindly consider the letter and necessary actions on high priority. Pandemic has taken high toll on mental health of hardworking resident doctors.

While IIT- Bombay has extended the dead line for re -exam till June, IIT-Kanpur has allowed a waiver of two courses (out of 40 -45 courses) for graduating students. Apart from relaxing the attendance norms and submission deadlines, IIT -Delhi is allowing students to take the I -grade (an incomplete grade) based on self -certication (instead of a medical certicate). The I - grade will allow them to take the exam later when their mental and physical condition is better. An ocial at IIT -Delhi said the institute extended the deadlines for submissions of projects and assignments and the faculty has been asked to go extra soft on students. While they had a policy of allowing students to audit elective courses based on their interests , now the institute is allowing the students to audit one co re course as well. Auditing a course allows students to take a course, but the grade in that course will not impact the overall CGPI. However, students will have to get a pass grade in that course, said the ocial. The institute has also resolved that students can be given a D grade even with 30 marks, because of the pandemic. At IIT-Kanpur the graduating students will be allowed to avail a waiver of 18 credits or two courses (out of approximately 40- 45 https://medicaldialogues.in/ Congratulations! Login to view result courses in the four-year programme), said director, Abhay Karandikar. Many graduating students who have a backlo1g 1in 1one or two subjects will still be able to graduate and get their degrees with this waiver, said Karandikar, adding that it will bring relief and reduce students' anxiety. In addition, they can also avail waiver for lab courses that were not oered in either semesters. The waiver was extended even last year and around 100 students availed it. The institute is also allowing no fail grade this semester and i n some cases students can de -register and repeat the courses if need be. You have successfully cast your vote The senate at IIT -Bombay has resolved to give students an option to convert their lower grades into pass grades for projects. The institute has also requested all faculty to be considerate in grading students given the second wave, said deputy directo r (academics and infrastructural aairs), S Sudarshan. \"Students have also been given time ti ll June to complete their re - exams. Usually, the deadline is the end of May. This is to ensure students who have Covid emergencies at home, have enough time to recover before the exam,\" said the professor. Based on what other institutes are oering, studen ts at IIT -Bombay have demanded an absolute no -fail policy. In an article in their campus magazine, Insight, the students pointed out that the institute did not make any changes to their failing policies despite the second wave. It could make sense to fail students if all students are getting equal opportunities to attend classes, to focus on academics and exams, they said. They demanded that no student be failed in any course in this semester unless they are guilty of malpractice. Prof Sudarshan said that absolute no -fail policy cannot be an option at the institute, since most of the evaluation has already been done by the faculty members throughout the semester. And unlike last year, when the semester had to end abruptly, this year it had been completed. H e added that faculty members have been asked to try avoiding the FR grade (failed without re- exam) and allow students to give at least an option of re -exam to clear the course. https://medicaldialogues.in/ 112 IIT-Madras has allowed the faculty to be more flexible since May 2020. The institute has permitted viva -voce exams for modest sized classes, said a spokesperson. https://medicaldialogues.in/ Advertiseme nt ANNEXURE P/8 113 Don't advise India's doctors and hospital sta\" to do yoga, meditation and exercise in the middle of the second wave of Covid.

ALOK KULKARNI 9 May, 2021 8:30 am IST Nurses give oxygen to a Covid -19 patient in ICU at Ramakrishna Hospital in New Delhi | Photo: Suraj Singh Bisht | ThePrint Text Size: recently received a call from a senior anaesthesiologist, a family friend who works at a large private hospital in Mumbai. He said he was becoming abnormally aware of his heartbeat over the last two months. Then the anxiety kicked in \u2014 he could not intubate a severely ill Covid - 19 patient in the critical care unit. In his 35-year career, this had never happened. He froze, and another doctor had to take over. A sense of guilt continued to loom over him, and that's when he called me, a psychiatrist. Following an initial assessment over Skype, I determined that he was having a form of clinical anxiety. I put him in touch with a therapist who handled the non- pharmacological part of the illness. I started him on a short-term, low-dose anxiolytic. With medication and therapy sessions, he was soon able to gain control of his debilitating anxiety. This is just one incident - I have lost count of the number of people who have been reaching out to our organisation for help lately. When I checked about this with other colleagues, they also had similar stories to tell. Advertiseme nt ICU for 70yr man or 30yr woman? Doctors, nurses are turning to psychiatrists in 2nd wave A- A+ I https://medicaldialogues.in/ Doctors can't be on auto - pilot In India's second Covid wave, the toll on our healthcare professionals seems to be far worse. Especially when it comes to their mental health. This phenomenon was not seen to this extent in the rst wave. In the second wave, along with Covid -19 patients, healthcare professionals are also feeling helpless. I recently read that a resident doctor at a private hospital in Delhi died by suicide allegedly due to the frustrating situation he had to face on a daily basis. He had to deal with seven to eig ht critical patients every day in the Covid ward. He is survived by his two - month pregnant wife. Among most doctors, nurses and hospital sta, chronic exhaustion, pandemic fatigue, feelings of isolation, loneliness, lack of opportunity to grieve, and inadequate closures are setting in. More and more are reaching out for help. 114 Also read: Second Covid wave is causing guilt, anxiety, distress, NIMHANS helpline sees 40% spike in calls With barely a few months to recover after the rst wave, the existing workforce has been stretched thin, and healthcare workers are having to shoulder additional responsibilities. Unless the frontline workers are adequately rested, we cannot expect them to discharge their duties to the best of their abilities. Healthcare workers are humans too, and cannot function on auto -pilot mode. The overarching theme that is increasingly being seen among healthcare workers is fear. We have had several nursing professionals reach out to our team and say that they fear going back to the Covid ward. Advertiseme nt Rekha (name changed), working at a Covid hospital in Karnataka's Hubli, sought an online appointment. Advertiseme nt \"Doctor, I am in a catch -22 situation. My family and I can't make ends meet if I don't work. At the same time, I worry about stepping out into the Covid ward. I have this sense of restlessness throughout the day, and can't wait to get back home. I am exhausted by the time I reach home. I then have to make dinner for my family. It is depressing,\" she told us. One question gnaws at every healthcare worker: \"Am I inviting this untameable virus into my home?\" Despite this being a very realistic fear, doctors and nursing personnel are left with little choice. They don't have the luxury of not working on weekends, or of working from home. If they stop going to work, there will be no bread on the table. The irony of the situation is cruel. While they are working for survival, their very survival can come to a halt should they get infected. Work is not easy either. A slight error in judgement can be fatal; we https://medicaldialogues.in/ are talking about life and death situations. There is an acute shortage of beds, oxygen, and ventilators. This has forced doctors to make some hard choices \u2014 and that takes a https://medicaldialogues.in/ Not just yoga mental toll of its own. A 70-year -old man who is on the brink of collapse needs the ventilator as much as a 30-year -old woman who is battling severe Covid -19. And there is only one ventilator available. Which guideline do we turn to in such a situation? 115 Advertiseme nt Dr Ram (name changed), an interventional cardiologist in Maharashtra's Nashik, converted his state -of-the-art facility into a Covid hospital. He tells me that physicians at his hospital are under immense duress while making such hard choices. One of his physicians recently quit saying that he could no longer bear the mental fatigue accompanying such diicult choices. How are we to process the scale of this trauma? Are we supposed to carry on from one patient to another as though nothing has happened? My brother -in-law, a neurosurgeon, and my sister, an obstetrician, tell me some harsh details of the kind of pressure that frontline workers are facing. I see both of them being completely drained by the time they come back home. Their only respite is the family dinner that we all have together, and even then, the conversations veer towards the degree of emotional exhaustion that healthcare workers have to bear. Also read: Not all doctors think putting medical, nursing students on Covid duty is practical. Here's why India doesn't pay particular attention to mental health. But the second wave has exposed that denial too. A study conducted by the Ohio State University College of Nursing has found that critical care nurses in poor physical and mental health committed more medical errors than nurses in better health. Approximately 40 per cent screened positive fo r depression symptoms, and more than 50 per cent screened positive for anxiety. The National Mental Health Survey 2015 -16 conducted across 12 Indian states reveals that 1 in 20 Indians is clinically depressed. A part of the solution lies in incentivising healthcare workers. Compensation and work -related benets should be attractive enough to invite more workforce. The existing pay scale is discouraging, to say the least. In the unfortunate event of a healthcare worker succumbing to the virus, the family of the said worker should be adequately compensated. Prescriptive practices such as doing yoga, exercising, engaging in mindfulness meditation are largely applicable to non -healthcare workers. In the middle of such a pandemic, it is impractical to expect healthcare workers to nd the time to engage in such practices. Incentivisation will hopefully attract more workforce so that the existing professionals nd it a bit more easy to manage the work pressure and a rest cycle can be init iated. https://medicaldialogues.in/ Healthcare settings in India should take mental and emotional health seriously. In most medical colleges and hospitals, the department of psychiatry is relegated to a remote inaccessible corner, or may even be housed in a separate building, which is cut o from the main healthcare system. Integration of mental health into the general healthcare system should begin with easy access to mental healthcare. Psychiatry, as a subject, should be included in the undergraduate curriculum, and the nal year curriculum should evaluate students with a separate theory and practical exam. This will serve to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health, and also make more doctors aware of the ground realities of mental healthcare in our country. Hopefully, once we emerge out of this pandemic, we as a country, will make more of an eort to facilitate conversations around mental health. Of doctors and hospital sta too.

Dear & Respected Sir, There has been a need for manpower mobilization to tacklethe covid -crisis. The Prime Minister has implemented a few decisions on those lines i.e. - postponement of NEET -PG, postponement of final year post -graduatecourse examinations with an intention to 'increase the quantity of manpower available for Covid Care. While above efforts have been made towards increasi ng quantity of manpower,we must point out that efforts towards qualitative improvement have been lacking. There has been a significant amount of burnout amongst the final year residents (DNB, MD, MS, DM, MCh) who have been toiling twice as hard so as to ma nagetheir usual specialty as well as the additional (and more demanding) covid - related work. Many have been infected, and have suffered long term sequelae. The NMC has recommended ' extension of tenure of final year residents '. While we, exam going residen ts have no issues with working extra against covid for thebenefit of the nation, it is important that we should not be allowed to be de - motivated. Normally, 'tenure extensions' were handed out as punishments towards residents who failed their exams, or th ose who had attendance shortage. Currently, 'tenure extensions' are being handed out to residents, not for our failure, but for the failureof the society at large in preventing the second wave. Currently, the residents are toiling hard to save as many pati ents as they can, oftengetting infected with covid in the process, often taking the virus home to infect their families, and thus being surrounded with deaths at work, and at home. We the final -year residents may be asked to continue working in covid till need arises, however, with the following of our requests being awarded/rewarded: 1. One time waiver of examinations for the final year residents - We, residents have contributed immense efforts and time in handling the covid crisis since the past 15 months. We have proven our dedication and worth to the society. Final year examinations require intense, undivided attention for preparation. However, that would conflict with our focus upon covid care. Thus, a waiver of examinations would clear our mind off the stress of exams, and this would enable us to work harder in covid wards, thus, translating into a few more thousand lives saved . https://medicaldialogues.in/118 TELANGANA AL BODY : All Under Graduates All Post Graduates All Super Specialties I would like to point out at this time, that at the post -graduate level, the exam failurerates were usually less than 5 -10%. To expect us the dedicated warriors to 'clear an exam as a formality' in this situation would be a form of obstinate hypocrisy. These are special times, and unprecedented measures are need of the hour. During war -time in the 1960s, due to shortage of military officers, the NDA and IMA had in -advance passed out officers who were 6 -months away from completion of their cour se. This was done to augment manpower. Similarly, European countries such as the UK and the Italy fast tracked processes to bring final year trainees into the work -force (formally, not provisionally) in 2020. Similarly, in this situation, if the final year residents are awarded their degrees without the 'exam formality', we will have a huge qualitative leap in the workforce. 2. Our course tenure as 'residents' was for three years. If made to work beyond this tenure, we should be automatically accorded the next designation : - The MD/MS/DNB student may be designated as a Senior resident after completion of their course tenure of 3-years - The DrNB/MCh/DM student may be designated as an Assistant Professor after completion of their course tenure of 3-years Reaching out to you, With humble regards. - The Tired Resident Doctors of India Copy to: 1) Shri Narendra Modi, Honorable Prime Minister of India.

The petitioners abovenamed. MOST RESPECTFULLY SHOWETH: 1. In the captioned Writ Petition, the petitioners seek to challenge the notifications dated 27.4.2021 and 22.4.2021 issued by Respondent no. 3 whereby on one hand it had advised the medical colleges to further continue taking the services of post graduate Final year medical students/residents to keep up the fight against this pandemic and on the other it had advised the universities to decide the time and method of postgraduate pract ical final examination taking into consideration the pandemic situation in their area. The https://medicaldialogues.in/122 contents of the writ petition may be read as part and parcel of this application and are not being repeated fore brevity. 2. It is submitted that non wa iver of final examination of the final year post graduate medical students/resident doctors and not conferring them degree (without final exams) in the current pandemic situation contravenes Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution particularly, when they hav e been denied any preparation time owing to their COVID duty. It is important to note that preparation for final examinations requires undivided attention of the students which could hinder their services towards Covid care, and vice versa. 3. It is further submitted that not evaluating the petitioners based on past record/covid duty is harsh and manifestly arbitrary thereby contravening their fundamental right guaranteed under Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution. 4. Further it is important to note tha t under S. 61 (2) of National Medical Commission Act, the Post Graduate Education Regulation of erstwhile MCI is applicable. The said regulation mandates final examination for conferring a degree, but in the same vein it also mandates time limit for the sa me. The residency period of three years is already over. Despite being no provision for extension of residency the petitioners are made to extend it without any legal https://medicaldialogues.in/123 basis. Since the relevant law does not deal envisage the pandemic situati on, this Hon'ble Court has jurisdiction to entertain this petition. 5. Moreover, conferring degree to post graduate residents doctors would add to the pool of healthcare personnel as conferment of degree can be subjected to rendering of compulsory COVID duty by resident doctors for a fixed time frame. Many nations across the world had fast tracked the induction of the medical students in the healthcare system in their fight against COVID -19 pandemic. 6. The petitioners have a prima facie case and the balance of convenience lies in the favour of the petitioners as they have been precluded from preparing for their final exams by the action of the Govt. which has utilised their services without extending any benefits to them. Now expecting them to appear for their final exam without any preparation and amid the pandemic is not only against the duties of a welfare state but also contravenes fundamental rights of the petitioners. 7. Moreover, irreparable loss would be suffered by the petitioners as many universities have already started preparation for conducting exams and the petition would become infructuous if the impugned notifications are not stayed by this Hon'ble Court. https://medicaldialogues.in/124 8. That the present application is being filed bonafide and interest of Justice. PRAYER It is therefore prayed that this Hon'ble Court may graciously be pleased to. a) Stay the operation of the Notifications nos. notification no. NMC/MCI -23(1)/2021 -Med dated 27.4.2021 [Annexure P/4] issued by Respondent no. 3 while directing the Respondents to issue directions for not taking final examination of post graduate medical residents to all universities/institutions during the pendency of this petition. b) Pass suc h other and further orders as may be deemed just and proper by this Hon'ble Court, in the facts and circumstances of this case.
