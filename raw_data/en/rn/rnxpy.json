SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS OF LAW ............................................................ 122 ORDER ................................................................................................................................... 125 v I. INTRODUCTION A. Summary of Complaint and Answer The Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") issued the Complaint in this matter on September 16,2008 against Daniel Chapter One (\"DCa\") and James Feijo (\"Respondents\"). The Complaint alleges that Respondents have engaged in deceptive acts or practices in connection with the advertising; promotion, offering for sale, sale, and distribution of four products: BioShark, 7 Herb Formula, GDU, and BioMixx (collectively, the \"Challenged Products\"). Complaint Ij[ 3. The Complaint also alleges that Respondents operate linked web pages on the website, www.danie1chapterone.com. through which they advertise and sell the Challenged Products. Complaint Ij[ 5. The Complaint alleges that the Challenged Products are advertised to prevent, treat, or cure cancer or tumors, Complaint Ij[ 5, and specifically charges that the advertisements represent, expressly or impliedly, that: Bio*Shark inhibits tumor growth; Bio*Shark is effective in the treatment of cancer; 7 Herb Formula is effectiv~jp the treatment or cure of cancer; 7 Herb Formula inhibits tumor formation; GDU eliminates tumors; GDU is effective in the treatment of cancer; BioMixx is effective in the treatment of cancer; and BioMixx heals the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. Complaint Ij[ 14. The Complaint further alleges that Respondents represented, either expressly or by implication, that they possessed and relied upon a reasonable basis that substantiated the claims made, but that Respondents did not, in fact, possess and rely upon such reasonable basis. Complaint Ij[Ij[ 15, 16. The Complaint charges Respondents with unfair or deceptive acts or practices, in or affecting commerce, in violation of Sections 5(a) and 12 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (\"FTC Act\"). Complaint Ij[ 17. In their Answer, filed on October 11, 2008, Respondents admit that they operate a website that provides information on the Challenged Products in a religious and educational context, but otherwise deny allegations that they engaged in deceptive acts or practices in connection with the advep:ising or sale of the Challenged Products. Answer Ij[ 5. Respondents averred that they did possess and rely upon a reasonable basis that substantiated the . representations made about the Challenged Products at the time the representations were made. Answer Ij[ 16. Respondents' Answer also asserted six affirmative defenses. By stipulation of the parties, in an Order entered by the Administrative Law Judge (\"AU\") on January 8, 2009, the six affirmative defenses raised by Respondents in their Answer were stricken. On February 11, 2009, Respondents filed a motion to amend the Answer through which they sought to amend paragraphs 3, 5, and 14 of their Answer. The motion was opposed by Complaint Counsel. By Order dated March 4,2009, Respondents' motion to amend was denied on the grounds that the proposed amendments would not facilitate a determination of a controversy, were not necessary to avoid prejudicing Respondents, did not conform to the evidence, and, coming after the close of discovery and approximately two months before trial, would have been unduly prejudicial to Complaint Counsel. Ol\\.February 25,2009, Respondents filed a second motion to amend their answer, this time to add an affirmative defense that the Commission, in filing the Complaint and seeking the Cease and Desist Order included with the Complaint, was substantially burdening Respondents' free exercise of religion in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-l(a) and (c). Complaint Counsel opposed the motion. By Order dated March 9, 2009, Respondents' motion to amend was denied on the grounds that the proposed amendment would not facilitate a determination of a controversy, and, coming after the close of discovery and approximately two months before trial, would have been unduly prejudicial to Complaint Counsel. B. Procedural History Respondents filed their first motioil\"to disrriiss on January 13,2009, in which they contended, among other things, that the FTC has no jurisdiction over Respondents because DCO is a nonprofit religious ministry, not a commercial enterprise. Complaint Counsel opposed the motion. By Order dated February 2,2009, the first motion to dismiss was denied on the grounds that Respondents had made a facial attack on the Complaint and that an evaluation of the allegations of the Complaint, which\"must be and were taken as true on such a motion to dismiss, sufficiently provided a basis for jurisdiction. On February 13,2009, Respondents filed a motion to reconsider the Order Denying Respondents' Motion to Dismiss Complaint. The motion was opposed by Complaint Counsel. By Order dated February 23,2009, Respondents' motion was denied on the ground that Respondents failed to meet their burden for reconsideration. Respondents filed a second motion,to dismiss on February 25, 2009, in which Respondents again challenged the FTC's jurisdiction, arguing, among other things, that DCO is a nonprofit religious ministry. The second motion to dismiss referenced evidence outside the Complaint and thus was not a facial attack that could be decided only on the allegations of the Complaint. Complaint Counsel opposed the motion. On February 25, 2009, Respondents also filed a motion for summary decision. Complaint Counsel, too, filed a motion for summary decision on February 25,2009. Both motions were opposed. By Order dated March 20,2009, it was held that Respondents' second motion to dismiss and both parties' motions for summary decision could not properly be resolved prior to a determination of whether the FTC has jurisdiction over Respondents. Accordingly, those motions were held in abeyance until after the conclusion of a hearing on jurisdiction. 2 On March 20,2009, an order was issued setting an evidentiary hearing and oral argument to determine jurisdiction under Sections 4 and 5 of the FTC Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 44, 45. The FTC Act gives the Commission authority over \"persons, partnerships, or corporations,\" 15 U.S.c. \u00a7 45(a)(2), and defines \"corporation\" to include \"any company ... or association, incorporated or unincorporated, without shares of capital or capital stock or certificates of interest, except partnerships, which is organized to carryon business for its own profit or that of its members.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 44. The hearing on jurisdiction was held on April 21, 2009. Following the conclusion of that hearing, a ruling was issued from the bench that Complaint Counsel had demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that jurisdiction does exist in this case. Respondents' second motion to dismiss and both parties' motions for summary decision were denied, as stated on the record in open court. Transcript of April 22, 2009 Final Pre-Hearing Conference, 4-6. Respondents, on April 23, 2009, filed a motion for a Rule 3.23(b) determination authorizing Respondents to immediately appeal the denial of Respondents' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Complaint Counsel opposed this motion. By Order dated May 5, 2009, that motion was denied on the ground that Respondents failed to satisfy any of the three prongs of the stringent three-prong test for inter1ocutory~ppeaL Following the hearing on jurisdiction, the final pre-hearing conference was held on April 22,2009, with trial commencing immediately thereafter. Over seventy exhibits were admitted and eleven witnesses testified at the hearing on jurisdiction and at trial. The testimonial portion of the trial concluded on April 27,2009. On May 28, 2009, the parties filed concurrent post-trial briefs, proposed findings of fact, and\"1Jroposed conclusions of law. The parties filed concurrent replies to each other's briefs and proposed findings on June 11, 2009. Closing arguments were heard on July 9,2009. The hearing record was closed, pursuant to Commission Rule 3.44(c), by Order dated May 7,2009. Rule 3.51(a) of the Commission's Rules of Practice states that an Initial Decision shall be filed \"within ninety (90) days after closing the hearing record pursuant to \u00a7 3.44(c) ... or within such further time as the Commission may by order allow upon written request from the Administrative Law Judge.\" 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.51(a). Ninety days from the close of the record is August 5, 2009. Commission Rule 3.51(a) also states that an Initial Decision shall be filed within one year \"after the issuance of the administrative complaint, except that the Administrative Law Judge may, upon a finding of extraordinary circumstances, extend the one-year deadline for a period of up to sixty (60) days.\" 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.51(a). The Complaint in this matter was issued on September 16, 2008. One year from the issuance of the Complaint is September 16,2009. 3 C. Evidence This Initial Decision is based on the exhibits properly admitted into evidence, the transcripts of testimony at the hearing on jurisdiction and at trial, and the briefs and proposed fmdings of fact and conclusions of law, and the replies thereto, submitted by the parties. Citations to specific numbered findings of fact in this Initial Decision are designated by \"F.\"} Under Commission Rule 3.51(c)(I), \"[a]n initial decision shall be based on a consideration of the whole record relevant to the issues decided, and shall be supported by reliable and probative evidence.\" 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.51(c)(1); see In re Chicago Iron Co., No. 9300, 138 F.T.C. 1024, 1027 n.4, 2005 FTC LEXIS 215, at *3 (Jan. 6,2005). Under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"AP A\"), an AU may not issue an order \"except on consideration of the whole record or those parts thereof cited by a party and supported by and in accordance with the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.\" APA, 5 U.~.C. \u00a7 556(d). All findings of fact in this Initial Decision are supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. This Initial Decision is based on a consideration of the whole record relevant to the issues and addresses the material issues of fact and law. Ruling upon a decision of another Commission, and interpreting almost identical language to that in Commission Rule 3.51(c)(1) in the APA, the U.S. Supreme Court held that \"[b]y the express terms of [that Act], the Commission is not required to make subordinate fmdings on every collateral contention advanced, but only upon those issues of fact, law, or discretion which are material.\" Minneapolis & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. United States, 361 U.S. 173, 193-94 (1959). Accord Stauffer Labs., Inc. v. FTC, 343 F.2d 75,89 (9th Cir. 1965). See also Borek Motor Sales, Inc. v.

Accordingly, proposed findings of fact that are not included in this Initial Decision were rejected, either because they were not supported by the evidence, or because they were not dispositive or material to the determination of the allegations of the Complaint or the defenses thereto. Similarly, legal contentions and arguments not addressed in this Initial Decision were rejected, because they lacked support in fact or law, were not material, or were otherwise lacking in merit. All contentions and arguments in the parties' post trial-briefs and reply briefs were reviewed and considered. D. Summary of the Initial Decision As set forth in this Initial Decision, the record indicates that DCO, described by Respondents as a house ministry, led by Respondent James Feijo, with his wife Patricia Feijo, engaged in business for profit for itself or for its member, James Feijo. DCO's activities include spiritual and nutritional counseling to individuals, and advertising and selling dietary supplements to the public. Respondents sell four products at issue in the Complaint: BioShark, 7 Herb Formula, GDU, and BioMixx. The evidence shows that Respondents disseminated advertisements for the purpose of inducing, and which did induce, the purchase of a food or drug, in or having an effect on commerce, and that these advertisements claim that the Challenged Products, individually or collectively, prevent, treat, or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, or ameliorate the adverse effects of radiation and chemotherapy. The evidence further shows that Respondents did not have a reasonable basis to substantiate these claims and that the claims made are material to consumers. Complaint Counsel has carried its burden of proving that Respondents are liable under Sections 5(a) and 12 of the FfC Act. The defenses raised by Respondents have been considered and are determined to be without merit. The remedy imposed is an appropriate cease and desist Order. 5 ', -..

Respondent Daniel Chapter One (\"DCO\") is a corporation sole organized in 2002 under the laws of the State of Washington. (Respondents' Answer to FfC's Complaint, Oct. 14,2008 (hereinafter referred to as Answer) <J[ 1; Complaint (hereinafter referred to as CX _) 31; J. Feijo, Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Apr. (hereinafter referred to as HOJ Tr. _) 84). . 2. DCO' s Articles of Incorporation list the registered agent and incorporator for DCO as Rita Johnson and list her mailing location as P.O. Box 110788, Tacoma, Washington, 98411, non-domestic. (CX 31). 3. DCO's Articles of Incorporation list DCO's mailing address and principal location as James Jesse Feijo, c/o 21916 Southeast 392nd Street, Respondent\"DCO nor Respondent James Feijo maintains a building at that address. (CX 31; J. Feijo, HOI Tr. 93-95). 4. DCO's principal office and place of business are located at 1028 East Main Road, Portsmouth, Rhode Island 02871. (Answer <J[ 1; Deposition of James Feijo, Jan. as R, t5 (1. Feijo, Dep. at _\u00bb at 99). 5. Respondent James Feijo is the overseer of DCO and, in this capacity, is responsible for all of the activities of Respondent DCO. (Answer <J[ 2; R 15 (1. Feijo, Feijo, Trial Transcript (hereinafter referred to as Tr. _) at 416). 6. James Feijo is the trustee for DCO's assets and for all of the funds held by DCO. He is responsible for paying all of DCO's bills and directing DCO's funds. (1. Feijo, HOJ Tr. R 15 Dep. at 193, 198\u00bb. 7. Patricia Feijo is Respondent James Feijo's wife and is the secretary for DCO. James and Patricia Feijo are the only officers of DCO. (Answer <J[ 2; 39 259,276). 2. Overview of Respondents' activities 8. Respondents currently sell 150 to 200 products (\"DCO products\"), including the four products challenged in the Complaint: BioShark, 7 Herb Formula, GDU, and BioMixx (collectively, the \"Challenged Products\"). (R 15 (J. Feijo, Dep. 37); 53-54; 1. Feijo, HOJ Tr. 314-15). 6 9. Respondents have generated approximately $2 million in annual gross sales for the years 2006,2007, and 2008 for all of DCO's nearly 200 products. (CX 44; R 15 at Tr. 109,223-24). 10. At present, 100% of DCO's product sales or distribution is dietary supplements. (J. Feijo, Tr. 419-20). 11. In 1983, DCO began as what James Feijo described as a house church - a church operating not in the typical sense that people think of, with a building, sign, and established doctrines, but as a church that meets in houses to worship and break bread, with no set times for religious meetings. (J. Feijo, HOJ Tr. 180-82,263-64). 12. In 1986, DCO opened a health food store and began selling food sources. DCO began selling dietary supplements within the first year. (J. Feijo, Tr. 417-19). 13. In the mid-1990s, DCO began to develop its own dietary supplements and created, BioMixx, before creating BioShark, 7 Herb Formula, and GDU, which Respondents created after 1993. (J. Feijo, Tr. 4.~~, 423~24) .. 14. In 1998, Respondents created the website (hereinafter the \"DCO Website\"). (R 15 (1. Feijo, Dep. at 202\u00bb. 15. Around 1999, Respondents created the \"BioGuide\" and the \"Cancer Newsletter\" (see infra F. 86,94). (R 15 (J. Feijo, Dep. at 200\u00bb. 16. According to James and Patricia Feijo, DCO was created for the purpose of healing based on the scripture of Daniel Chapter One and other biblical verses including Genesis 1:29, where, according to James and Patricia Feijo, God said he created food for healing.

During the July 14, 2008 DCO HealthWatch radio program, Patricia Feijo advised an individual whose f-ather was diagnosed with colon cancer that she should get her father \"on ... GDU, BioShark and 7 Herb Formula. And if you can get him to, you know, go right now to the website, How To Fight Cancer Is Your Choice, or you can get him a hard copy from our order center, while we have them. It's what the FTC wants to shut us down over and they certainly want us to, you know, crash the website and they want to, you know, bum our material. They don't want us circulating How To Fight Cancer Is Your Choice.\" (CX 8 at FTC-DCO 0693-0694). 32 f. Summary 218.

(F. 8-9, 80-81, 106, 159-78, 180,221,266). 219. The DCO advertising for the Challenged Products collectively, referred to in F. 179-88, 190, 192, 194-201, and 203-10, makes claims that relate to consumer health. (F. 189, 191, 193,202,211). 2. BioShark a. DCO Website 220. CX 12, a printout of the webpage for BioShark on the DCO Website, is Exhibit A to the Complaint. CX 12A is another depiction of the same product webpage as CX 12, but captured so as to show the entire width of the page. (CX 12; CX 12A). 221. The webpage content begins with a heading in bold type, \"Immune Boosters.\" Underneath that heading is a picture of bottles of BioShark, and under that a phrase in small print, \"shark cartilage Supplemental Facts.\" Immediately appearing under this small phrase is the following: Bio*Shark: Tumors & Cysts Pure skeletal tissue of sharks which provides a protein that inhibits angiogenesis -the formation of new blood vessels. This can stop tumor growth, and halt the progression of eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Should not be used by pregnant women, or immediately after heart surgery. Shark cartilage may also reduce the pain, inflammation, and joint stiffness of arthritis, alleviate inflammatory bowel disease, and reverse psoriasis. Shark cartilage is an excellent source of Calcium, Phosphorus, amino acids, and a family of carbohydrates called mucopholysaccharides (sulfated Oligosaccharides and Chondriotin Sulfates A and C). In summary, Bio*Shark works to reduce inflammation and swelling, affects the formation of new blood vessels and provides essential nutrients for healing. Warning: If you are pregnant, nursing a baby, recovering from recent surgery, or have a heart or circulatory condition, consult a 33 health professional before using shark cartilage! Adjacent to that text is a shopping cart icon with the instruction, \"BUY NOW!\" hnmediately below that is the [sic] testimonials on BioShark & Tumors,\" and a link to a bulleted title \"Cancerous Tumor.\" At the bottom of the webpage is a link to \"Stop Tumor Growth & Cysts Top.\" (CX 12; CX 12A) (emphasis in original). 222.

The Cancer News webpage on the DCO Website includes the following statements under the heading, in bold type, Bio*Shark TM: In 1983, two researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a study showing that shark cartilage contains a substance that significantly inhibits the development of blood vessels that nourish solid tumors, thereby limiting tumor growth. This effect is called anti\u00ad angiogenesis. Scientists recognize the benefits of starving a tumor to limit its growth. They have been looking for a drug to patent that can do the same thing as shark cartilage. They say the answer to curing cancer lies in preventing angiogenesis -the formation of blood vessels which feed the tumor. These scientists are trying to replicate what God has already presented to us so that they can claim rights to it, patent it and make a lot of money. But man can never lab synthesize a product and make it exactly the same - and all drugs have harmful side effects. Researchers have also demonstrated that shark cartilage can reduce the inflammation and pain associated with arthritis, alleviate psoriasis and have a positive effect on other degenerative diseases. (CX 13 at FTC-DCO 0023) (emphasis in original). 226. The DCO webpage, \"Cancer News,\" which makes representations regarding the 34 Challenged Products as a group (F. 180-88) states: \"If you suffer from any type of cancer, Daniel Chapter One suggests\" taking several DCO products, including BioShark.

The www.danie1chapterone.com webpage, \"Cancer News,\" which makes representations regarding the Challenged Products as a group (F. 180-88) states: \"If you suffer from any type of cancer, Daniel Chapter One suggests taking\" several DCa products, including BioMixx 1M. A prominent picture Of a bottle of BioMixx follows, adjacent to which is a statement in bold type, \"Daniel Chapter One's Cancer solutions.\" Under the picture, the text states: To Buy the products click here 45 How to fight cancer is your choice! (CX 13 at FTC-DCO 0013-14; CX 13A) (emphasis in original). 284. The www.danielchapterone.com Cancer News webpage includes the following testimonial, accompanied by a photograph of a smiling woman: Tracey was given no hope! The doctors had pretty much given up on Tracey. She had leukemia and tumors on the brain, behind the heart and on her liver. I had contracted leukemia and had three inoperable tumors. When I decided not to do chemotherapy or radiation, my father sent me Bio*Mixx and 7 Herb Formula. Each day as I took it and got it into my system more and more, the better I felt. Then I added Garlic Pur, Siberian Ginseng, and . Bio*Shark. I am now in complete remission. The cancer cell count has dropped, the doctors tell me: . I had a tumor just above the brain stem in my brain that has completely disappeared. The tumor on my liver is shrinking and the tumor behind my heart has shrunk over 50% .... (CX 13 at FTC-DCO 0016) (emphasis in original). 285. BioMixx is promoted along with the other Challenged Products on the DCO website www.dc1pages.com. where the following text appears: Supporting Products To enhance 7 Herb,Formula's healing quantities Daniel Chapter One advises to get familiar with the supporting products below: Immediately below that text is a photograph of bottles of each of the Challenged Products. Adjacent to the photograph, in bold print, the following appears: CANCER TREATMENT: 7Herb at FfC-DCO 0190) (emphasis in original). 286. The overall net impression from the website content for BioMixx described in F. 283-85 is that BioMixx is effective in the prevention, treatment, or cure of cancer. h. BioGuide 287. The product description for BioMixx in DCO's BioGuide includes the statements: Helps detoxify the body, boosts immunity and energy ....

Complaint Counsel's proffered expert (1) Qualifications 320. Dr. Denis Miller (\"Miller\"), who was called to testify as an expert for Complaint Counsel, is a board-certified pediatric hematologist/oncologist. (Miller, Tr. 29; Expert Report of Denis R. Miller, M.D., dated Jan; 28, 2009, (hereinafter referred to as CX 52 (Miller Report) at __ ) at 1). 321. For over forty years, Miller has directed clinical care, education, laboratory and clinical research, and administration, heading divisions or departments at University of Rochester Medical Center, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and Northwestern University Medical School. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 1). 322. Miller also has served as Associate Medical Director of Cancer Treatment Centers of America (\"CTCA\") and as Scientific Director of CTCA's Cancer Treatment Research Foundations. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 1). 323. As Scientific Director, Miller supervised the clinical research program and was principal investigator for a number of Phase IIII clinical studies involving treatments for hematological malignancies. <wd cancers of the head and neck, lung, breast, pancreas, and colon. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 1-2). 324. Miller has authored or co-authored over 300 book chapters, peer-reviewed articles, and abstracts, and has served on the editorial boards of the British Journal of Hematology and the American Journal of Clinical Oncology. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 3). 325. Miller currently is the OncologylHematology Therapeutic Area Leader at PAREXEL International, a leading contract research organization, where he manages clinical trials for the pharmaceutical industry. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 2). 326. Based on his training, experience, and familiarity with this area of research, Miller is qualified to give e*pert opinions in the area of cancer, cancer research, and research methodology. (F. 320-25). (2) Scope of work and materials considered 327. Miller was asked to determine whether there is competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate the following claims: BioShark inhibits tumor growth; BioShark is effective in the treatment of cancer; 7 Herb Formula is effective in the treatment or cure of cancer; 7 Herb Formula inhibits tumor formation; GDU eliminates tumors; GDU is 52 effective in the treatment of cancer; BioMixx is effective in the treatment of cancer; and BioMixx heals the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 4). 328. To form his opinions, in addition to drawing upon his expertise in cancer care and treatment, Miller conducted literature searches, including searches in PubMed, Google, PDQ, NCI, MSKCC, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Search Medica, Stanford HighWire, Clinical Trials.gov, and many cancer and hematology journals such as the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Clinical Cancer Research, Blood, British Journal of Haematology, Supportive Care in Oncology, American Journal of Oncology, and the New England Journal of Medicine. Miller also reviewed materials provided by Complaint Counsel, including the Complaint and the DCO advertising attached to the Complaint as exhibits A through D, DCO advertising on www.danielchapterone.com. the BioGuide, the labels for the Challenged Products, and thirty testimonials regarding DCO products. Miller also reviewed the materials Respondents stated that they relied upon for substantiation. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 5- 7). h. Responden~ '. proffered. experts (1) Qualifications 329. Respondents proffered five individuals as expert witnesses: James Duke, Ph.D.; Sally LaMont, N.D.; Rustum Roy; and Jay Lehr, Ph.D. 330. Dr. Duke (\"Duke\") is a retired economic botanist. He has compiled and maintains a database which includes the chemical composition (\"phytochemicals\") of approximately 3,000 species of herbs, and codes the nature and extent of published data indicating biological actions for those chemicals. The data ranges from folklore, to animal or in vitro evidence, to approval of the chemical for those biological actions by foreign bodies referred to as Commission E or the Tramil Commission. (Duke, Tr. 476-78; R 18 (Duke, Dep. at 59,91,93, 118-19\u00bb. 331. Dr. LaMont (\"LaMont\") is a licensed naturopathic doctor and acupuncturist. Naturopathic doctors focus on primary prevention of illness and on stimulating the body's innate heal.ing capacities to treat the underlying causes of disease. Naturopathic doctors, including LaMont, commonly use herbs in their practice. (LaMont Tr. 539, 541- 42). LaMont also works with mind-body therapies and regularly suggests meditation, qigong, yoga, and other biofeedback-type of therapies that would strengthen the connection between a person's mind and immune system. (R 22 (LaMont, Dep. at 20\u00bb. 332. Rustum Roy (\"Roy\") is a scientist and an educator in the physical sciences and in integrative medicine. (Expert Report of Rustum Roy, dated Feb. 4, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as R 5 (Roy Report) at __ ) at 2). 53 333. J ames Dews (\"Dews\") is a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals and \"nutraceuticals,\" which Dews described as a merger of food supplements and pharmaceuticals. A nutraceutical can be created by extracting the chemical compounds from a food supplement. He helped create and manufacture the product that eventually became 7 Herb Formula. (R 19 (Dews, Dep. at 17-18,34-36,76\u00bb. 334. Jay Lehr (\"Lehr\") is a Ph.D. environmental scientist and has written a book on health and fitness. (R 21 (Lehr, Dep. at 9-10\u00bb. Lehr has known James Feijo for approximately ten years and takes the Daniel Chapter One products PrePost, Endeurosine, and Mito/ATP to enhance his athletic performance. He has also recently begun taking GDU for his arthritic hip. (R 21 (Lehr, Dep. at 16-18\u00bb. 335. None of Respondents' proffered experts is a medical doctor.

None of Respondents' proffered experts reviewed the DCO advertising claims at issue in the case in preparing their opinions. (R 18 (Duke, Dep. at 36-37); Duke, Tr. 534; R 22 (LaMont, Dep. at 32-34, 56-58,77-78); R 5 (Roy Report) at 1, FTC-DCO 0238-99; R 20 (Roy, Dep. at 7); R 6 Report) at 7-8; R 19 (Dews, Dep. at 36-38); R 21 (Lehr Report) at 2-4). 339. Respondents did not ask their proffered experts to render an opinion as to whether Respondents' purported substantiation materials constituted competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating a claim that any of the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer. (R 3 (Duke Report) at 1; R 4 (LaMont Report) at 3; R 5 (Roy Report) at 1; R 6 (Dews Report) at 2; R 21 (Lehr Report) at 2). 340. Respondents did not ask their proffered experts to render an opinion as to whether there existed any competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating a claim that any of 54 the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer. (R 3 (Duke Report) at 1; R 4 (LaMont Report) at 3; R 5 (Roy Report) at 1; R 6 (Dews Report) at 2; R 21 (Lehr Report) at 2). 341. Respondents' proffered experts did not opine as to whether there is competent or reliable scientific evidence substantiating a claim that any of the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer. (R 3 (Duke Report) at 1,3; R 4 (LaMont Report) at 3, 40; R 5 (Roy Report) at 1; R 6 (Dews Report) at 2, 14; R 21 (Lehr Report) at 2). 342. None of Respondents' proffered experts reviewed the DCO advertising claims at issue in the case in preparing their opinions. (R 18 (Duke, Dep. at 36-37); Duke, Tr. 534; R 22 (LaMont, Dep. at 32-34, 56-58, 77-78); R 5 (Roy Report) at 1, DCO 0238-99; R 20 (Roy, Dep. at 7); R 6 (Dews Report) at 7-8; R 19 (Dews, Dep. at 36-38); R 21 (Lehr Report) at 2-4). 3. Level of substantiation required to support anti-cancer effects 343. \"Competent and reliable scientific evidence\" is required to conclude that a cancer treatment is effective. (Miller, Tr. 66-68). 344. Competent and reliable scientific evidence means in part that a hypothesis has been established. To constitute competent and reliable scientific evidence that a product treats, cures, or prevents cancer, the product's efficacy and safety must be demonstrated through controlled clinical studies. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 7; see also LaMont, Tr. 596 (stating that the definition of competent and reliable scientific evidence includes a \"spectrum\" of evidence, such as studies of animals and cell culture lines, but that investigation into a compound's safety and efficacy progresses \"towards clinical outcome studies in an office-based practiCe or a university setting, and eventually moves towards human clinical trials\"\u00bb. 345. Clinical studies are studies. on humans. Non-clinical studies are performed in test tubes and in animals with the aim of demonstrating potential activity and acceptable safety. Once non-clinical studies have been performed, the study proceeds into progressive phases of clinical trials in humans. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 9). 346. Only data from well-designed, controlled, clinical trials will substantiate a claim that a new therapy is safe and effective to treat, cure, or prevent cancer. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 30). 347. The proper format for any clinical trial protocol includes the following: Details of the rationale for the study; clear elucidation of primary and secondary objectives; clear presentation of the investigation plan, including study design, selection of subjects, study treatments, documentation of prior and concomitant illnesses and treatments, and study 55 procedures; description of specific methods of data collection, quality assurance, and quality control; description of statistical procedures; reporting of studies of pharmacokinectics, pharmacodynamics, quality of life, and health economics; discussion of overall conclusion regarding safety and efficacy; relevant references; tables and figures; selected subject listings of demographics, disease and treatment parameters, endpoints, safety factors, and deaths; and subject narratives for serious adverse events and deaths. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 8-9; Miller Tr. 66-68). 348. Claims that a dietary supplement prevents cancer, aids in the treatment of cancer, or can be used as a primary treatment for cancer, as opposed to claims that a dietary supplement is good nutrition, require substantiation. (Miller, Tr. 152). 349. Anti-cancer agents may work by preventing cell proliferation (division), inducing programmed cell death (apoptosis), inhibiting growth factors or biochemical pathways that result in cell death, and inhibiting new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis). Anti\u00ad angiogenic agents have an important role in the treatment of some types of cancer. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 10). 350. The process required to prove that a drug is safe and effective for the treatment of disease is very costly. Testing used to prove-that a drug is a safe and effective treatment for disease is a particularly challenging and costly endeavor to undertake for testing herbal products, because it is difficult to extract and test a single chemical component from an herb, and because an herb may comprise thousands of chemical components. (Miller, Tr. 181; Duke, Tr. 499-502, 537-38; see also LaMont, Tr. 596-97). 351. Testimonials do not substitute for a well-designed clinical trial. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 30). 352. Anecdotal reports are the weakest form of evidence to support the anti-cancer activity of a new agent. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 11-12). 353. Testimonials have very little scientific validity. In the thirty testimonials reviewed by Miller, many of the patients were taking other modalities of anti-cancer therapy. There was insufficient documentation that the individuals had cancer. There was no valid instrument to measure their reported response to the Challenged Products. A patient's report that he or she \"felt better,\" standing alone, does not scientifically measure the patient's response. (Miller, Tr. 141-42,214-15). 4. Potential harm from alternative or ineffective remedies 354. The need to substantiate a claim of anti-cancer activity with competent and scientific evidence is the same whether the purported agent is an herbal medicine or a conventional pharmaceutical agent. \"There [are] not . .. two kinds of medicine. There's not conventional medicine and alternative medicine. There's one medicine, medicine that 56 works. The other medicine mayor may not work, but to show that it works you have to go through the process .... [T]here shouldn't be a separate, different, less rigorous way of identifying the safety and the efficacy of so-called complementary medicine just because it's complementary. It has to go through the same process because we want to help cancer patients and we want to make sure that what they're getting is safe and effective.\" (Miller, Tr. 144). 355. Effective complementary medicine adds to the efficacy of standard anti-cancer therapy, reducing some of cancer therapy's adverse side effects (e.g., nausea and vomiting, severe neutropenia, anemia, fatigue), improving general well-being and quality of life, and permitting oncologists to administer effective doses of therapy on time. Many new targeted therapies work better when given with conventional anti-cancer therapy and rarely are as efficacious when given as single agents. Suggesting that complementary medicine can be an effective substitute for traditional medicine would be a disservice to cancer patients because delays in effective therapy may allow cancer cells to regrow, develop resistance to therapy, and metastasize. (eX 52 (Miller Report) at 11). 356. Taking the Challenged Products presents a potential harm. This is most acute if a cancer patient foregoes potentially beneficial and effective therapy and replaces that option with BioShark,7 Herb Formula, GDU, or\u00b7BioMixx, alone or in combination with other DCO products. Diagnosing cancer early and treating it appropriately and effectively still offers the best chance of curing it. The use of complementary or alternative therapies exclusively as front-line treatment will result in disease progression. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 12). 357. The Challenged Products are not necessarily harmless simply because they are herbs as opposed to drugs. Everything has potential side effects. One example is cat's claw, an ingredient in 7 Herb Formula. Cat's claw may have an effect on a very important enzyme system in the liver that causes either the breakdown of other drugs or may activate other drugs. As a result of this interaction, cat's claw might increase the concentrations of some drugs in the patient's system, which can lead to toxicity, or can cause an increased breakdown of those drugs, thereby lessening their efficacy. Cat's claw increases the activity of many drugs given for high blood pressure, which can result in hypotension (low blood pressure). Cat's claw can cause diarrhea, which is particularly adverse for a cancer patient who already may be nutritionally challenged. Cat's claw may also cause bleeding by affecting the blood's clotting system, thereby potentially increasing the risk of bleeding in a cancer patient. Thus, if a cancer patient is already taking a medication that lowers his or her platelet count or increases his or her risk of bleeding, this could be an extremely dangerous interaction. (Miller, Tr. 111-13). 358. Side effects are also affected by the dosing. One example of the importance of proper dosing is with Turkish rhubarb root, a component of 7 Herb Formula. Turkish rhubarb root contains tannins, which, in high doses, cause diarrhea and, in lower doses, cause constipation. (Miller, Tr. 117). 57 359. Another example of the importance of proper dosing comes from a study of parthenolide, the active ingredient in feverfew, a component of GDU. The study was designed to determine through dose escalation what dose of parthenolide would show evidence of activity in cancer patients. Researchers were unable to measure any parthenolide in the bloodstream at the doses administered in the study. Even with very low doses, patients had side effects, including fever, chills, nausea, diarrhea, blurred vision, and fatigue. (Miller, Tr. 130-31). 360. An example of potentially harmful interactions was reported in a study of curcumin, the active ingredient in tumeric, a component of GDU. That study reported that curcumin can block or decrease the activity of a number of commonly used anti-cancer chemotherapy agents, including those used to treat breast cancer, colon cancer, and lymphoma. (Miller, Tr. 126). 361. Enhancing a deficient immune system is important. An over-enhanced immune system can be related to a number of autoimmune diseases, including malignancies like multiple myeloma. (Miller, Tr. 218-19). 5. No competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate claims about the Challenged Products, either alone or in combination with -other nco products 362. The reference materials relie{tupon by Respondents do not constitute competent and reliable scientific evidence that any of the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 31; Miller Tr. 143). 363. There is no competent and reliable scientific evidence that the Challenged Products are effective, either alone or in combination with other DCO products, in the prevention, treatment, or cure of canc~r, in inhibiting tumor formation, or in ameliorating the adverse effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 31; Miller Tr. 143). 364. Since BioShark, 7 Herb Formula, GDU, and BioMixx have not been tested, their effectiveness in the prevention, treatment, or cure of cancer is not known. (R 22 (LaMont, Dep. at 47-48); LaMont, Tr. 579-82). 365. The majority of the materials relied upon by Respondents as substantiation were not peer\u00ad reviewed papers. The materials did not include controlled clinical trials. The materials consisted of author opinions and reviews of literature on the use of herbal medicines for a number of different diseases, includ~g cancer. (Miller, Tr. 81-82). 366. Many of the studies cited by Respondents as substantiation were non-clinical studies, i.e., in vitro or animal studies. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 10). 58 --_. --: ... -~ 367. Other studies relied upon by Respondents as substantiation evaluated isolated compounds that are present in some of the Challenged Products and showed nonspecific immunostimulatory activities or suggested cancer preventive effects. This does not substitute for an actual evaluation of each Challenged Product itself. It is not possible to extrapolate from results of a published non-clinical study of curcumin that GDU can eliminate tumors. GDU itself, or each active ingredient in GDU, must be subjected to the same experimental conditions as those to which the curcumin was subjected. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 11). 6. No competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate BioShark claims 368. The reference materials relied upon by Respondents do not constitute competent and reliable scientific evidence that BioShark inhibits tumor growth in humans or that it is effective in the treatment of cancer in humans. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 13). 369. Respondents' reliance on Dr.!. William Lane's book, \"Sharks Don't Get Cancer,\" was misplaced, as studies at Johns Hopkins University indicate that sharks do indeed get cancer. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 16). 370. There have been no adequate and well-controlled studies demonstrating that BioShark is anti-angiogenic or is effective in the treatment of cancer, and even supporting non\u00ad clinical studies of crude or partially-purified shark cartilage products were extremely limited, particularly with reg<gd to mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and dose response. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 17). 371. There is no competent and reliable scientific evidence that any crude shark cartilage product is effective in treating human cancer. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 17). 7. No compet~nt and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate 7 Herb Formula claims 372. The reference materials relied upon by Respondents do not constitute competent and reliable scientific evidence that 7 Herb Formula is effective in the treatment or cure of cancer or that it inhibits tumor formation. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 18). 373. There is no competent and reliable scientific evidence that 7 Herb Formula is effective in the treatment or cure of cancer or that it inhibits tumor formation. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 18). 374. There are no clinical or non-clinical studies supporting claims that 7 Herb Formula, or any of its individual ingredients, is an effective anti-cancer agent or inhibits tumor formation. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 19). 59 375. There have been animal and in vitro studies on the ingredients in 7 Herb Formula: Burdock root, cat's claw, sheep sorrel, slippery elm bark, Turkish rhubarb root, Siberian ginseng, and watercress. There have been no controlled clinical trials on humans with cancer. (eX 52 (Miller Report) at 18-22). 8. No competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate GDU claims 376. The reference materials relied upon by Respondents do not constitute competent and reliable scientific evidence that GDU eliminates tumors or is effective in the treatment of cancer. (eX 52 (Miller Report) at 22). . 377. There is no competent and reliable scientific evidence that GDU eliminates tumors or is effective in the treatment of cancer. (eX 52 (Miller Report) at 22). 378. There have been no randomized, controlled clinical trials of any of the individual components of GDU or of GDU itself in patients with cancer. (eX 52 (Miller Report) at 27). 379. Curcumin (tumeric), one of GDU's ingredients, is currently being evaluated in controlled clinical trials to determine its potential as a chemoprotective and cancer preventive agent. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 22). 380. Some animal studies have suggested that curcumin may have activity as a cancer preventive and therapeutic agent. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 23). 381. Some animal studies have also suggested that curcumin may actually inhibit the anti\u00ad cancer activity of some approved anti-cancer agents, as well as exacerbate iron deficiency. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 27). 382. Further research on curcumin is necessary to determine if curcumin has cancer preventive or chemotherapeutic effects. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 27). 9. No competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate BioMixx claims 383. The reference materials relied upon by Respondents do not constitute competent and reliable scientific evidence that BioMixx is effective in the treatment of cancer or heals the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (eX 52 (Miller Report) at 27). 384. There is no competent and reliable scientific evidence that BioMixx is effective in the treatment of cancer or heals the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 27). 60 385. There are no reported studies that either BioMixx, or any of its constituent ingredients, is effective in the treatment of cancer in humans. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 27-29). 386. There are absolutely no scientific data to support a statement that BioMixx assists the body in fighting cancer or in healing the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments. (CX 52 (Miller Report) at 29). 10. Substantiation through competent and reliable scientific evidence for Respondents' claims about the efficacy of the Challenged Products was not addressed by Respondents' proffered experts a. Duke 387. Duke was provided statements made by Respondents to review and was asked if the data he reviewed supported the accuracy of those statements. (Duke, Tr. 519). The statements he was given mirror selected statements from the product descriptions for the Challenged Products. (F. 238,263,293). Duke concluded: . There is a reasonable basis for the claims that the ingredients of 7 Herb Fonnula \"fights [sic] tumor.formation, and fights [sic] pathogenic bacteria.\" There is a reasonable basis for the claims that the ingredients of GDU \"contains [sic] natural proteolytic enzymes (from pineapple source bromelain) to help dig~st protein -even that of unwanted tumors and cysts. This fonnula also helps to relieve pain and heal inflammation .... GDU is also used for ... and as an adjunct to cancer therapy. GDU possesses a wide range of actions including anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic activity \" There is a reasonabl,e basis fqr the claims that the ingredients of BioMixx \"boosts [sic] the immune system ... to allow for natural healing. It is used to assist the body in fighting cancer and in healing the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments.\" (R 3 (Duke Report) at 3; Duke, Tr. 519-21, 536). 388. Duke's opinions do not address whether competent and reliable scientific evidence is necessary to substantiate advertising claims that any of the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, and/or heal the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (R 3 (Duke Report\u00bb. 389. Duke's opinions do not address whether there is competent and reliable scientific evidence to support advertising claims that any of the Challenged Products prevent, treat, 61 or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, and/or heal the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (R 3 (Duke Report)). 390. Duke's opinions db not address whether Respondents possessed and relied upon adequate substantiation to support their claims that any of the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, and/or heal the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (R 3 (Duke Report)). 391. Duke does not recall seeing any articles that James or Patricia Feijo believe to have substantiated the claims that Respondents made regarding the Challenged Products. (R 18 (Duke, Dep. at 185)). 392. Duke made no effort to determine whether there were any studies of any sort regarding the Challenged Products. (R 18 (Duke, Dep. at 190-91)). 393. Duke did not analyze any of the Challenged Products themselves, but instead analyzed only constituent ingredients of the Challenged Products. (Duke Tr. 524-27). 394. Duke did not know the concentrations of the ingredients contained in the Challenged Products. (Duke Tr. 533-34). b. LaMont 395. LaMont was provided labels from the Challenged Products, and the substantiation evidence upon which Respondents relied to support statements reflected in the then-draft complaint, including claims that BioShark inhibits tumor growth, 7 Herb Formula is effective in treating and curing cancer, GDU eliminates tumors, and BioMixx is effective in treating cancer.(R 22 (LaMont, Dep. Exs. 1,2)). 396. LaMont was asked to evaluate the labels and the substantiation evidence upon which Respondents relied, and to .write a report that would describe the mechanism of action of some of the constituents of the Challenged Products. In addition to reviewing Respondents' substantiation evidence, LaMont reviewed published medical literature in MedLine, PubMed, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering cancer website, and the American Botanical website, among other sources. (R 4 (LaMont Report at 3); LaMont, Tr. 549- 550). 397. Based on her review, LaMont concluded: There is a reasonable basis to claim that the ingredients of GDU contain bromelain, a source of natural proteolytic enzymes from the pineapple, which helps digest unwanted proteins. GDU also contains tumeric, feverfew and quercitin, which help to reduce inflammation and relieve pam. 62 Next, it is reasonable to claim that these ingredients as a whole may be used as an adjunct to cancer therapy, and that the ingredients possess a wide range of actions as anti-inflammatory agents. There is a reasonable basis to claim that the ingredients of 7 Herb Formula fight tumor formation, and fight pathogenic bacteria. There is a reasonable basis to claim that the ingredients of BioMixx boost the immune system, build lean body mass and support healing. It is also reasonable to claim that these ingredients assist the body in fighting cancer, cachexia and in healing the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments. (R 4 (LaMont Report) at 40; LaMont, Tr. 572-74). 398. LaMont's opinions do not address whether competent and reliable scientific evidence is necessary to substantiate advertising claims that any of the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, and/or heal the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (R 4 (LaMont Report)). 399. LaMont's opinions do not address whether there is competent and reliable scientific evidence to support advertising claims that any of the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, and/or heal the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (R 4 (LaMont~Report)). 400. LaMont's opinions do not address whether Respondents possessed and relied upon competent and reli-able scientific evidence when Respondents made claims that any of the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, and/or heal the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (R 4 (LaMont Report)). 401. LaMont did not analyze any of the Challenged Products themselves, but instead analyzed only the constituent ingredients of the Challenged Products. LaMont did not know the concentrations of the ingredients contained in any of the Challenged Products. (LaMont, Tr. 579,582-83). 402. LaMont was unable to conclude that there was any evidence to support a claim that 7 Herb Formula is effective in treating or curing cancer. (R 22 (LaMont, Dep. at 205)). 403. LaMont was unable to conclude that BioMixx is itself effective in the treatment of cancer or that it heals the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (R 22 (LaMont, Dep. at 210-11)). 63 c. Roy 404. Roy was asked to provide his opinion on the scientific validity of randomly controlled trials to evaluate whole-person healing; the science of homeopathy; and the scientific validity of traditional testing of herbal medicines. (R 5 (Roy Report) at 1). 405. Roy's conclusions included: Traditional randomly controlled double blind studies are inappropriate to evaluate whole-person healing approaches; whole-person healing approaches focus on the effect on the structure and function of the whole person, as opposed to the use of a drug to cure the symptoms of a disease; and cancer is a particular instance where whole-body healing approaches make more scientific sense than pharmaceutical approaches. (R 5 (Roy Report) at 1-2). 406. The bases for Roy's conclusions in F. 405 include his opinion that homeopathy was developed empirically, from observations of the effects of various different materials on the functioning of healthy subjects, as opposed to trying a specific biochemical drug to cure a symptom. (R 5 (Roy Report) at 1-2). 407. The bases for Roy's conclusions in F. 405 include his opinion that herbal medicines have been tested epidemiologically by natl:lTe over thousands of years and hundreds of human generations, while pharmaceutical drug testing relies on statistical projections from small controlled trials. (R 5 (Roy Report) at 3-4). 408. Roy's opinions do not address whether there is competent and reliable scientific evidence to support Respondents' clailI!s that any of the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, and/or-heal the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (R 5 (Roy Report\u00bb. 409. Roy's opinions do not address whether Respondents possessed and relied upon competent and reliable scientific evidence to support Respondents' claims that any of the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, and/or heal the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (R 5 (Roy Report\u00bb. 410. Roy did not review the Complaint in this matter or any of the challenged advertisements. (R 20 (Roy, Dep. at 7\u00bb. 411. Roy is not an expert in homeopathy. (R 20 (Roy, Dep. at 12\u00bb. 412. Roy has no idea what ingredients the Challenged Products contain. (R 20 (Roy, Dep. at 24\u00bb. 413. Roy did not review or obtain any of the products or product labels for the Challenged Products. (R 20 (Roy, Dep. at 7-8\u00bb. 64 -,- ',-,-,-----'------- ------------, 414. Roy does not have any fonnal training in medicine. (R 20 (Roy, Dep. at 26\u00bb. 415. Roy has never treated patients, or consulted with healers who were treating particular patients. (R 20 (Roy, Dep. at 28\u00bb. 416. Roy and his laboratory have not perfonned any clinical trials. (R 20 (Roy, Dep. at 13)). 417. Roy has never perfonned any experiments on humans to measure the efficacy of any medical treatments. (R 20 (Roy, Dep. at 14\u00bb. d. Dews 418. Dews was asked to provide his opinion on 7 Herb Fonnula. He concluded that all seven herbs are listed in the Herbal Phyicians' Desk Reference, that there are many references on what these herbs are used for, and that, in manufacturing the fonnula, he was careful to make sure it was safe. When fonnulating the product that eventually became 7 Herb Fonnula, Dews avoided using too much rhubarb, which has a laxative action, because he did not want the product to cause diarrhea. (R 6 (Dews Report) at 1, 8-9). 419. Dews' opinions do not address whether competent and reliable scientific evidence is necessary to substantiate advertising claims that any of the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, and/or heal the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (R 6 (Dews Report\u00bb. 420.

Dews' opinions do not add,ress whether Respondents possessed and relied upon competent and reliable scientific evidence to support Respondents' claims that any of the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, and/or heal the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (R 6 (Dews Report\u00bb. e. Lehr 422. Lehr was asked to opine on the efficacy of DCO products. His opinions are based on his own personal experience in taking the DCO product called PrePost. It was Lehr's opinion that since he started taking the DCO product PrePost, his \"life is totally different. ... It's just incredible .... And it's astounding, I mean.\" (R 21 (Lehr Report) at 6). 423. Lehr's opinions do not address whether competent and reliable scientific evidence is necessary to substantiate advertising claims that any of the Challenged Products prevent, 65 treat, or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, andlor heal the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. (R 21 (Lehr Report\u00bb. 424.

(R 21 (Lehr Report\u00bb. III. ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW A. Burden of Proof The parties' burdens of proof are governed by Federal Trade Commission Rule 3.43(a), Section 556( d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"AP A\"), and case law. FTC Rules of Practice, Interim rules with request for comments, 66 Fed. Reg. 17,622, 17,626 (Apr. 3, 2001). Pursuant to Commission Rule 3.43(a), \"[c]ounsel representing the Commission ... shall have the burden of proof, but the proponent of any factual proposition shall be required to sustain the burden of proof with respect thereto.\" 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.43(a). Under the APA, \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute, the prgponent of a rule or order has the burden of proof.\" 5 U.S.c. \u00a7 556(d). Respondents contend that, because of the constitutional issues raised by Respondents, Complaint Counsel should be required to prove the elements of the charges against Respondents by \"clear, cogent and convincing evidence.\" RCOL 1; RB at 4 n.2 (citing Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418 (1979\u00bb. Responde~ts' argument has no merit. Addington addressed the standard of proof required to commit an individual involuntarily to a state mental hospital- a serious deprivation of a well-recognized, constitutionally protected liberty interest. As shown in Section III E infra, Respondents' constitutional arguments are unsupported by fact or law. Accordingly, Addington does not alter the applicable standard of proof for this case. It is well established that the preponderance of the evidence standard governs FTC enforcement actions.

B. Jurisdiction over Respondents 1. Positions of the parties and procedural background Respondents assert that DCO is a not-for-profit religious organization and, as such, is not subject to the jurisdiction of the FTC. R Juris. Br. at 1-2. Specifically, Respondents assert that DCO is a religious ministry, incorporated as a corporation sole under the nonproftt corporation statutes of the State of Washington, and that James Feijo is the overseer of DCO, as defined under the corporation sole statute. R Juris. Br. at 1. Respondents further state that, as part of its missionary work, DCO addresses the health concerns of its followers, which led DCO to develop the Challenged Products. R Juris. Br. at 2. Maintaining that its religious ministry is not organized to carryon business for its own profit or that of its members, Respondents argue that DCO is not a corporation, as is required for jurisdiction under Sections 4 and 5 of the FTC Act. R Juris. Br. at 7-8. 67 Complaint Counsel argues that DCO is not a bona fide charitable institution, but is instead a for-profit commercial enterprise, completely controlled by James Feijo, from which he and his family derive substantial pecuniary benefits. CC Juris. Br. at 4. Complaint Counsel further contends that Feijo runs a multi-million dollar commercial operation that competes with for-profit entities in commerce. CC Juris. Br. at 5. On April 21, 2009, a hearing was held for the limited purpose of determining whether DCO is a corporation within the meaning of Section 4 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 44, and applicable case law. Apr. 21,2009 Hearing on Jurisdiction (\"HOJ\"). After the conclusion of that hearing, a ruling was issued from the bench that Complaint Counsel had demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there is jurisdiction over both Respondents, DCO and James Feijo, under Sections 4 and 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 44 and 45, and that the conduct challenged in this case is in or affecting commerce within the meaning of those Sections. HOJ Tr. 347-48. See also Order Memorializing Bench Rulings on Jurisdiction, Respondents' Motion to Dismiss, Motions for Summary Decision, and Respondents' Motion for Stay Pending Interlocutory Appeal, Apr. 27, 2009. The analysis in support of that ruling follows. 2. Summary of background facts Respondents maintain that DCO is a house church. According to James Feijo, a house church is a church operating not in the typical sense, with a building, sign, and established doctrines, but instead is a church meeting in houses to worship and break: bread, with no set times for religious meetings. (J. Feijo, HOJ Tr. 180-82,263-64). James and Patricia Feijo testified that DCO was created for the purpose of healing based on the scripture of Daniel Chapter One and other Biblical verses, including Genesis 1 :29 where it is written that God said he created all things for our food for healing. (J. Feijo, Tr. 417-23; R 16 (P. Feijo,Dep. at 39- 40)). According to Patricia Feijo, the name Daniel Chapter One comes from the Book of Daniel in the Old Testament of the Bible, in which Daniel and his men were in captivity and were expected to eat the king's very rich diet of meats and wine, but instead ate and drank only pulse and water; after 10 days, their eyes were said to be brighter and they were said to be stronger than the king's men. (R 16 (P. Feijo, Dep. at 40-41)). James and Patricia Feijo testified that DCO's ministry activities include helping house churches in other countries, holding religious meetings, performing baptisms, delivering babies, performing marriage ceremonies, performing healings, and reaching out to others to inform them about Respondents' perspectives on the integration of spiritual and physical well-being. (R 16 (P. Feijo, Dep. at 204-05); J. at 73); P. Feijo, Tr. 325-26). Respondents claim that they have created a combined spiritual and scientific approach that maintains the balance of bodily systems. F. 85. James Feijo named this approach \"BioMolecular Nutrition.\" F. 85. Respondents sell the four products challenged in the Complaint over the Internet through their websites and through the BioMolecular Nutrition Product Catalog, which lists and describes 68 products sold by DCO. F. 84,91. The BioMolecular Nutrition Product Catalog sets forth the DCO Website address, www.danie1chapterone.com. for consumers to shop online, and lists the toll-free number that consumers can use to place orders. F. 91. In addition, Respondents operate a radio program, DCO HealthWatch, to which cancer patients have called in and received counseling about taking the Challenged Products. F. 108-10. Respondents contend that because their activities in promoting and selling the DCO Products are in furtherance of the Feijos' spiritual and scientific beliefs, they are outside the FTC's jurisdiction. 3. Analytical framework In analyzing whether the FTC has jurisdiction over Respondents, the starting point is the language of the statute itself. United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 580 (1981). Section 5(a)(1)-(2) of the FTC Act grants the FTC the authority to \"prevent unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce\" by \"persons, partnerships, or corporations.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a)(1)-(2). Section 4 of the FTC Act defines \"corporation\" in part as \"any company, trust, so-called Massachusetts trust, or association, incorporated or unincorporated, ... without shares of capital or capital stock or certificates of interest, except partnerships, which is organized, to carryon business for its own profit or that of its members.\" 15 u.s.c. \u00a7 44. In interpreting the language of Section 4 of the FTC Act, courts and the Commission have consistently held that an entity organized as a nonprofit is within the jurisdiction of the FTC if the entity in fact engages in business for its own profit or that of its members. California Dental Ass'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756, 766-67 (1999); Community Blood Bank, 405 F.2d at 1017 (Commission's jurisdiction extends to any legal entity without shares of capital which engages in business for profit in the traditional-meaning of that language). In Community Blood Bank, the Court of Appeals explained that \"under \u00a7 4 the Commission lacks jurisdiction over nonprofit corporations without shares of capital, which are organized for and actually engaged in business for only charitable purposes, and do not derive any 'profit' for themselves or their members within the meaning of the word 'profit' as attributed to corporations having shares of capital.\" 405 F.2d at 1022. Commenting on Community Blood Bank, the Commission stated: \"The court thus established a two-pronged test looking both to the source of the [entity's] income, i.e., to whether the corporation is 'organized for and actually engaged in business for only charitable purposes,' and to the destination of the income, i.e., to whether either the corporation or its members derive a profit.\" In re College Football Ass'n, 1994 FTC LEXIS 350, at *51-52. Thus, the analysis of jurisdiction in this case begins with an evaluation of the source of DCO's income and an inquiry into whether DCO is actually engaged in business only for charitable purposes. Then, the focus turns to whether DCO in fact engages in business for its own profit or that of its members. In addition, jurisdiction over James Feijo individually is assessed. Finally, the evidence that Respondents' activities are in or affecting commerce is evaluated to establish that the FTC has jurisdiction over Respondents with respect to the acts or practices challenged in the Complaint. 69 4. DCO is not a business organized or engaged in only charitable purposes a. DCO operates a commercial enterprise Profit, the 'jurisdictional touchstone\" of the FIC Act, California Dental, 526 U.S. at 767, is determined in accordance with the \"traditional and generally accepted meaning of that word.\" Community Blood Bank, 405 F.2d at 1017. \"According to a generally accepted definition 'profit' means gain from business or investment over and above expenditures, or gain made on business or investment when both receipts or payments are taken into account.\" Community Blood Bank, 405 F.2d at 1017. The dictionary defmition of profit includes \"a valuable return: GAIN,\" and \"to be of service or advantage ... to derive a benefit: GAIN,\" as well as the traditional concept of profit in business as \"the excess of returns over expenditure in a transaction or series of transactions; esp[ eciall y] the excess of the selling price of goods over their cost.\" M erriam\u00ad Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 1993). Respondent DCO has a toll-free phone number and a call center and operates websites through which consumers may purchase DCO products. F. 84,99, 103-04. In addition, DCO sells its products through stores in Georgia and Pennsylvania and through various distributors, including chiropractic centers. F. 116-19. The DCO Website contains a tab inviting consumers to shop at DCO's \"On-Line Store.\" F. 105. The \"About Us\" section on the DCO Website describes the company as a \"health food store\" or \"health food supplement store.\" F. 32. In their websites and brochures, Respondents compare their products and their organization to ~'other brands\" or \"other companies.\" E.g., F. 137; F. 138 (DCO Website stating: \"Daniel Chapter One is the first and only company to add Siberian ginseng to the formula\"). Over a thousand consumers have purchased DCO's products. F. 81. Respondents have generated approximately $2 million in annual sales for the years 2006, 2007, and 2008 for all of DCO's nearly 200 products. F.9. Its sales of the Challenged Products constitute twenty or thirty percent of its sales. F. 80. Respondents charge consumers three to ten times what it costs Respondents to purchase the Challenged Products from manufacturers. F. 83, 127-29, 140-42, 144-46. Significantly, DCO was incorporated as a for-profit corporation from 1991 to 1997 and sold the Challenged Products since at least 1993 and throughout the 1990s. F. 12-13,22-23,27. DCO's Articles of Incorporation during this period stated that the purpose for which DCO was organized as a for-profit corporation was: \"To engage in the sale, retail, wholesale and distribution of health products, including but not limited to health foods and supplements, namely those with special nutritive qualities and values.\" F. 23. DCO changed its corporate form to corporation sole in 2002 and continued to sell the Challenged Products. F. 8-9,28. It appears that DCO's revenues exceed its expenses, since DCO was able to completely support two individuals and their homes (see infra Section III B 5) and to maintain surpluses in 70 various accounts in the hundreds of thousands of dollars for extended periods of time.2 F. 42-45. A showing that DCO was successful in running its business, however, is not required. See California Dental, 526 U.S. at 768 n.6 (\"It should go without saying that the FTC Act does not require for Commission jurisdiction that members of an entity tum a profit on their membership, but only that the entity be organized to carryon business for members' profit.\"); In re Ohio Christian College, No. 8820, 80 F.T.c. 815,849-50, 1972 FTC LEXIS 223, at *72 (May 19, 1972) (stating that the fact that respondents \"were apparently not very successful in their enterprise\" was of \"little consequence\"). b. DCO is not organized only for charitable purposes Respondents' principal ground for arguing that the FTC lacks jurisdiction is that DCO is a ministry, organized as a corporation sole under the laws of the State of Washington as of October 30, 2002, and that James Feijo is the overseer of Daniel Chapter One, within the meaning of the Washington State statute authorizing the creation of a corporation sole. R Juris. Br. at 1 (citing R 1 (DCO's Articles of Incorporation) and Rev. Code Wash. (ARCW) \u00a7 24.12.030). However, courts and the Commission look to the substance, rather than the form, of incorporation in determining jurisdiction under the FTC Act. Community Blood Bank, 405 F.2d at 1019 (\"mere form of incorporation does not put [an entity] outside the jurisdiction of the C,ommission\"); In re American Medical Ass\"n, No: 9064, 94 F.T.C. 701, 1979 FTC LEXIS 182, at *239 (Oct. 12, 1979), enforced as modified, 638 F.2d 443 (2d Cir. 1980), aff'd by an equally divided court, 455 U.S. 676 (1982). Regardless of DCO's form of incorporation, the evidence shows that DCO bears none of the substantive indicia of a corporation that is truly organized only for charitable purposes. DCO is not registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) or any other section of the IRS Code. F.31. In evaluating the FTC's 2 The record on DCO's revenues and expenditures is not clear. It is noted that Respondents failed to fully comply with discovery requests regarding their finances, even after being ordered to do so, but Complaint Counsel was able to obtain some limited financial records by subpoena. Complaint Counsel asked for an adverse inference that the information sought from Respondents in discovery would have defeated Respondents' nonprofit argument. CC Juris. Br. at 22. James Feijo, DCO's sole trustee, testified that he does not keep records or keep track of the money DCO distributes. F. 6,40,47; see also F. 50-54 (Respondents did not maintain documents even after being ordered to produce documents in this procceding). Although an adverse inference in this case may have been appropriate, see Hamilton v. Accu-Tex, 32 F. Supp. 2d 47,68 (E.D.N.Y. 1998) (drawing adverse inference on interstate revenue in order to determine interstate commerce, an element for long-arm jurisdiction, and finding \"since the necessary information is in the exclusive control of defendants, where they have failed to provide the information, this Court finds that plaintiffs have satisfied their burden, and the case should proceed\"), it is not necessary here, because the facts are sufficient to demonstrate that DCO operated as a business for its own profit or that of its members. 71 jurisdiction, \"[t]he Commission has long recognized that while the teTInS employed in other statutes and the interpretation adopted by other agencies are not controlling, the treatment of exemptions for nonprofit corporations by other branches of the Federal Government is helpful.\" In re College Football Ass 'n, 1994 FfC LEXIS 350, at * 52 (June 16, 1994) (citing In re Ohio Christian College, 80 F.T.C. at 848; In re American Medical Ass'n, 1979 FfC LEXIS 182, at *254 (finding an entity's tax-exempt status certainly one factor to be considered and observing that a detennination by another federal agency that a respondent is or is not organized and operated exclusively for eleemosynary purposes should not be disregarded)). In Community Blood Bank, the fact that respondents were exempt from federal income tax liability was among the factors weighed in finding that the FfC lacked jurisdiction. 405 F.2d at 1020. Respondents contend that it is immaterial for jurisdictional purposes that DCO does not have a Section 501(c)(3) tax exemption because, according to Respondents, churches do not need to obtain such exemption, pursuant to Section 508(c)(1)(A) of the IRS Code. Contrary to Respondents' argument, Section 508(c)(1)(A) exempts churches from certain notice requirements applicable to other entities seekin~ to obtain a Section 501(c)(3) tax exemption, and has no bearing on the issue of FfC jurisdiction. , 3 Section 508 provides in pertinent part: (a) ... Except as provided in subsection (c), an organization organized after October 9, 1969, shall not be~!reated as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) [26 USCS \u00a7 501(c)(3)] -- (1) unless it has given notice to the Secretary, in such manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe, that it is applying for recognition of such status, or (2) for any period before the giving of such notice, if such notice is given after the time prescribed by the Secretary by regulations for giving notice under this subsection. (b) Presumption that organizations are private foundations. Except as provided in subsection (c), any organization (including an organization in existence on October 9, 1969) which is described in section 501(c)(3) [26 USCS \u00a7 501(c)(3)] and which does not notify the Secretary, at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may by -regulations prescribe, that it is not a private foundation shall be presumed to be a private foundation. (c) Exceptions. (1) Mandatory exceptions. Subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply to-- (A) churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches .... (emphasis added). 72 Moreover, as summarized below, in Section III B 5, DCO distributes funds for the use of both James and Patricia Feijo, private individuals and DCO's corporate officers. The Internal Revenue Code provides an exemption from income taxation for corporations where \"no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private ... individual.\" 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3). The Nonprofit Corporation Act of the State of Washington defines a nonprofit corporation as a corporation no part of the income of which is distributable to its members, directors, or officers. Rev. Code Wash. (ARCW) \u00a7 24.03.005. With the distribution of funds for use by James and Patricia Feijo, DCO would not qualify as a tax-exempt nonprofit corporation under either the Internal Revenue Code or laws of the State of Washington. In addition, DCO's Articles of Incorporation do not declare that DCO was organized exclusively for charitable or other clearly nonprofit purposes, but instead include provisions permitting \"other worthwhile projects for the comm0n good of Daniel Chapter One and its close associates, along with other acts and programs beneficial to Daniel Chapter One at large.\" F 29- 30. Further, DCO's Articles of Incorporation do not provide for distribution of its assets upon dissolution solely to other nonprofit entities or prohibit distribution of its earnings to the benefit of any individual or for-profit corporation. F 30. By contrast, in Community Blood Bank, in which the Court found the FfC lacked jurisdiction, the articles of incorporation of the nonprofit entities: declared that they were organized exclusively for educational and charitable purposes; declared that no part of their earnings shalfiilure to the benefit of any member or any other individual or corporation; and, required that the corporation's assets, upon dissolution, be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the state's nonprofit corporation law. 405 F2d at 1020. c. DCO -is not engaged in business only for charitable purposes It is not disputed that DCO has engaged in some charitable activities. In some instances, Respondents gave away DCO products and provided counsel to persons in need. F. 19,21. Respondents have at times allowed people in need to stay in their house and provided support to a junior men's fast-pitch softball team. F. 19-20. However, Respondents did not provide documents to indicate how much of DCO' s products they have given away or how much financial support they have dedicated to charitable activities, and the testimony on this point was inconclusive. F 54. Furthermore, the evidence shows, as summarized in Section III B 5 infra, that in addition to its charitable activities, DCO distributes funds to support all of the living expenses of both James and Patricia Feijo. This contribution of funds to the Feijos defeats Respondents' claim that DCO is operated exclusively for charitable purposes. As noted in Community Blood Bank: '\"'A religious association might sell cookies at a church bazaar, or receive income from securities it holds, but so long as its income is devoted exclusively to the purposes of the corporation, and not distributed to members or shareholders, it surely does not cease to be a nonprofit corporation merely because it has income .... \" Community Blood Bank, 405 F2d at 1019-20 (quoting with approval dissenting opinion in In re Community Blood Bank, 70 FT.C. 728, 1966 FTC LEXIS 30, at *455 (Sept. 28, 1968). In Community Blood Bank, the uncontradicted evidence showed that no part of any funds received by respondents had ever been distributed to or inured to the benefit of any of their members, directors, or officers. Community 73 Blood Bank, 405 F.2d at 1020. But here, as summarized below, where the evidence clearly shows that Dca distributes funds to the Feijos, DCO's income is not devoted exclusively to charitable or other nonprofit purposes. 5. DeO engages in business for its own profit or that of its members Whether Respondent DCa is a ministry is not dispositive in determining the FTC's jurisdiction over Respondents' activities. Instead, the pivotal inquiry is whether Respondent DCa engaged in business for its own profit or that of its members. California Dental, 526 U.S. at 766-67; Community Blood Bank, 405 F.2d at 1017. In Community Blood Bank, the individual respondents \"were 'public-spirited volunteers' and derived no personal profit, benefit or advantages in their individual occupations ... from their participation in the activities of the community-wide blood bank program.\" 405 F.2d at 1021. ''Their activities at all times were directed toward promoting a community-sponsored program in the public interest and at no time were infected with commercial intent.\" Id. at 1021-22. The Commission, in Ohio Christian College, noted that the court in Community Blood Bank found that the challenged boycotting activities were motivated by a sincere belief that commercial trafficking in blood was immoral and not in the public interest. In re Ohio Christian College, 1972 FfC LEXIS 223, at *65. 'The Commission went on to state: \"Whether one agrees with this belief or not, it is apparent the actions of the corporate respondents in Community Blood Bank were well-intentioned and did not inure to the financial benefit of anyone.\" Id. Thus, the Commission has made clear that, for fmding jurisdiction, what matters is not what respondents' subjective motivations are, but whether respondents' actions inure to their own financial benefit. Applying that principle to this case, what matters, for finding jurisdiction, is not whether Respondents' commercial activities are motivated by religious beliefs, but whether Respondents' activities inured to their own financial benefit, which, as summarized below, they clearly did. a. DeO distributes funds to the Feijos \"[T]he distribution of funds to private persons or for-profit companies as opposed to their use for 'recognized public purposes' is one basis for finding an entity to be 'organized to carry on business for ... profit.'\" In re College Football Ass'n, 1994 FTC LEXIS 350, at *49. See also California Dental, 526 U.S. at 766-67 (holding that jurisdiction arose from economic and pecuniary benefits conferred by nonprofit trade association on its for-profit members); In re American Medical Ass'n, -1979 FTC LEXIS 182, at *240 (stating that Section 4 does not require a transfer or delivery of monetary profits to the members of a non-stock corporation, but only pecuniary benefits to its members from the corporation's activities); In re Ohio Christian College, 1972 FTC LEXIS 223, at *68 (\"'Profit does not necessarily mean a direct return by way of dividends, interest, capital account or salaries. A saving of expense which would otherwise necessarily be incurred is also a profit to the person benefitted.\"') (citation omitted). 74 It is undisputed that DCO pays all of the Feijos' living expenses. F. 58. DCO or its affiliate owns two houses (one in Rhode Island and one in Florida, on country club land with a pool in the back), in which the Feijos stay without paying rent. F. 55. DCO also owns two cars (a 2003 Cadillac and a 2004 Cadillac) which the Feijos use. F.56-57. Respondent James Feijo does not have his own individual bank account. F. 76. Both James and Patricia freely use DCO credit cards for personal expenses. F. 66. DCO pays all of the Feijos' expenses, including pool and gardening services for the Feijo house in Florida; Patricia Feijo's tennis club membership; James Feijo' s membership at the Green Valley Country Club in Rhode Island; and, during the period from December 2005 to March 2009, golf expenses of $9,936, restaurant expenses of $14,024, automobile expenses of $28,582, and cigar expenses of $1,077. F. 58, 61-70. This distribution of funds, which amounts to a saving of expense which might otherwise be incurred by the Feijos, is a profit to the Feijos and provides a basis for finding that DCO is organized to carryon business for profit. Respondents argue that jurisdiction should not be based upon the economic benefits conferred upon the Feijos because the Feijos do not take salaries from DCO for their work and because they live modestly. R Juris. Br. at 7. Neither of these things affects jurisdiction in this case. The Feijos have no need to take salaries, since James Feijo controls all of the assets of DCO and can direct whatever funds he chooses for the support of himself and his wife. F. 6,40. Second, it is not necessary for the Peijos to 1ive lavishly for jurisdiction to be proper under Section 4. The Supreme Court, in California Dental, specifically rejected the notion that the profit received must be substantial: \"There is accordingly no apparent reason to let the statute's application turn on meeting some threshold percentage of activity for this purpose [of profit], or even satisfying a softer formulation calling for a substantial part of the nonprofit entity's total activities to be aimed at its members'\"4Jecuniary benefit. To be sure, proximate relation to lucre must appear .... \" 526 U.S. at 766. It is sufficient for the purpose of finding jurisdiction that the economic benefits conferred are more than \"de minimis\" or \"merely presumed.\" [d. at 767 and 767 n.6. In this case, the complete financial support of James and Patricia Feijo, including, among other things, two homes, two cars, tennis lessons, rounds of golf, cigars, restaurant meals, and club memberships, constitutes neither simply presumed nor de minimis economic benefits. The Commission found jurisdiction under Section 4 on similar facts in Ohio Christian College, which involved deceptive trade practices by a nonprofit religious college. The Commission stated: [T]he question is not whether a corporation amassed profit, but how it disposed of such profit. From the facts available to the Commission, we find the relationship between [Ohio Christian College] and the individual respondents in dealing with the dissipation of profits strikingly similar to that existing between a closely-held commercial corporation and its . officer-shareholders. The cavalier treatment of the corporate assets and finances leads us to conclude that respondents considered them their own. The individual respondent ... has complete control over the purse strings, he sets all salaries (including his own), determines all allocation and 75 expenditures, signs all checks and exercises plenary power over the affairs of the school. The record shows the corporation was organized and controlled so that the individual respondents could take what they wanted prior to any further disposition or comingling of funds. 1972 FfC LEXIS 223, at *69-70. In this case, as well, James Feijo treated the income and expenditures of DCO cavalierly. He claimed to keep no financial records, and to have no idea of how much money DCO had or how much money was spent on various aspects of its operations or for the support of the Feijos' living expenses. F. 47, 50, 59. Moreover, since James Feijo had no individual bank account, he used DCO's assets at will, thereby treating those assets as his own. As in Ohio Christian College, such circumstances support jurisdiction over DCO as an entity that is organized to carry on business for profit. b. nco's profit inures to its sole member, James Feijo As a corporation sole, DCO has one member, James Feijo, the overseer of DCO. Pursuant to the State of Washington's Nonprofit Corporation Act, under which DCO is organized: Any person, being the ... overseer ... of any church or religious denomination in this&tate, may, in conformity with the constitution, canons, rules, regulations or discipline of such church or denomination, become a corporation sole, in the manner prescribed in this chapter ... ; and, thereupon, said ... overseer ... shall be held and deemed to be a body corporate, with all the rights and powers prescribed in the case of corporations aggregate; and with all the privileges provided by law for religious corporati<;>ns. Rev. Code Wash. (ARCW) \u00a7 24.12.010. See also Barnett v. Hicks, 792 P.2d 150, 155 (Wash. 1990) (Dore, J., dissenting on other grounds) (noting that under Washington law, a corporation sole vests full management power in one individual). The evidence in this case shows that James Feijo controls the money made by DCO. F. 6,40-41. The structure of the corporation sole enables James Feijo to set his and his wife's salaries and benefits without the check of a managing board of directors or other individuals. Further, DCO pays all of the Feijos' living expenses, including food, clothing, housing, transportation, travel, recreation, and more. F. 55-58, 61-70. These economic benefits constitute profit to James Feijo. Thus, DCO engages in business for the profit of its sole member, James Feijo. 76 6. James Feijo is a person over whom the FTC has jurisdiction The FTC has jurisdiction under Section 5(a)(2) over persons, partnerships or corporations. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a)(2). If individuals direct and control the acts and practices of a corporation amenable to the FTC's jurisdiction, then they too may be made subject to the FTC's jurisdiction. In re Ohio Christian College, 1972 FTC LEXIS 223, at *62-63; see FTC v. Amy Travel Serv., Inc., 875 F.2d 564,573 (7th Cir. 1989) (holding that individual who either participated directly in or had the authority to control deceptive acts or practices may be held liable under the FTC Act for the violations of his corporation). Respondent James Feijo both participated directly in and had the authority to control the acts or practices challenged in this case. Respondents admit that Respondent Feijo is responsible for the activities of Respondent DCO as its overseer. F. 5. The activities for which he is responsible include the development, creation, production, and distribution of the Challenged Products; the creation, management, and maintenance of DCO's toll-free telephone number through which consumers may order the Challenged Products; the setting of prices for the , Challenged Products; and the creation, drafting, and approval of the directions for usage and the recommended dosages of the Challenged Products,F. 37-39, 100. Respondent James Feijo and his wife, Patricia Feijo, are also responsible for the information contained in DCO's advertising and promotional materials, including the BioGuide, the Cancer Newsletter, the Most Simple Guide, and the web sites www.danielchapterone.com, www.7herbforrnula.com, and www.gdu2000.com. F. 165-66, 173, 178. In addition, Respondent Feijo and his wife co-host the DCO radio program, Daniel Chaptet:~One HealthWatch, for two hours daily, Monday through Friday, on which they have counseled individuals who have called into the radio program about taking DCO's products. F. 108-10, 178. Finally, Respondent Feijo is the trustee for all of DCO's assets, including all funds which are held in trust. F. 6, 40. Thus, Respondent James Feijo had the authority to direct and control, in fact did direct and control, and participated directly in the challenged acts or practices of DCO, a corporation that is subject to the FTC's jurisdiction. Accordingly, Respo.ndent James Feijo is a person over whom the Commission has jurisdiction, and he may be held individually liable under the FTC Act for the deceptive acts and practices found below. 7. Respondents engage in interstate commerce Section 5(a)(1) of the FTC Act declares unlawful \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\" 15 U.S.c. \u00a7 45(a)(1). Section 12 of the FTC Act provides that the dissemination of any false advertisement, for the purpose of inducing the purchase in or having an effect upon commerce, of food or drugs, shall be an Unfair or deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce within the meaning of Section 5. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 52. In their Answer, Respondents admit that they distribute the Challenged Products in commerce. Answer'll 4. Respondent DCO operates a call center and websites through which consumers may purchase the Challenged Products. F. 99, 103-04. DCO has sold its products 77 nationally through a number of stores, distributors, and chiropractic centers, including those in Florida, Georgia, Missouri, and Pennsylvania. F. 116-17, 119. These sales are in or affecting commerce. See United States v. Robertson, 514 U.S. 669,672 (1995) (\"[A] corporation is generally engaged in commerce when it is itself directly engaged in the production, distribution, or acquisition of goods or services in interstate commerce.\") (per curiam) (citation omitted). In addition, Respondents' advertisements of its products through the DCO websites (F. 158-61), which reach a national audience invoke the FfC's jurisdiction. See FTC v. Simeon Management Corp., 391 F. Supp. 697,703 (N.D. Cal. 1975) (holding that advertisements placed in newspapers, magazines, and on television with out-of-state circulat,ions and broadcasting ranges, were sufficiently involved in or affecting commerce to invoke the FfC's jurisdiction). To the extent that Respondents maintain that they do not sell the Challenged Products, but instead offer them for suggested donations, the evidence is to the contrary. For example, on their website www.dc1store.com. Respondents state: \"For Information on Special offers for purchasing multiple bottles of7-Herb call 1-800-504-5511 between 9-6 EST Mon-Fri.\" F. 107. In the BioMolecular Nutrition Product Catalog, which lists and describes the Challenged . Products and states \"Call Toll free or shop online,\" there is no indication that the listed prices are suggested donations. F. 91-92. An FfC investigator purchased the Challenged Products from the DCO Website, www.danielchapterone.com. on January 3, 2008. F. 147. At the time of his purchase, each of the Challenged Products was displayed on the DCO Website with a picture of the product, a short description of the product, and ~ corresponding price. F. 148. The shipment to the investigator of the Challenged Products did not contain any documents indicating that the purchase was a donation or thanking the purchaser for making a donation to DCO. F. 156. An e-mail the FfC investigator received after his purchase of the Challenged Products stated: \"Thank you for your purchase on our online store .... We appreciate your business with us,\" and offered a ten percent discount on a subsequent purchase. F. 152. The evidence clearly demonstrates that Respondents advertise and sell products, including the Challenged Products, throughout the United States, and that their sales are in or affecting commerce. Thus, the Commission has jurisdiction over Respondents, and the conduct challenged in the Complaint, pursuant to Sections 4 and 5 of the FfC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 44, 45. 8. Summary of jurisdiction The FfC has jurisdiction over DCO as a corporation, within the meaning of Section 4 of the FfC Act. Jurisdiction is also proper as to James Feijo, as a person directly participating in and controlling all activity of DCO, under Section 5 of the FfC Act. The conduct of Respondents is in or affecting commerce, pursuant to Sections 5 and 12 of the FfC Act. Accordingly, the FfC has jurisdiction in this matter. 78 C. Respondents' Dissemination of Advertisements to Induce Purchases of Food or Drugs Section 12 of the FTC Act makes it unlawful \"for any person, partnership, or corporation to disseminate, or cause to be disseminated, any false advertisement ... [b]y any means, for the purpose of inducing, or which is likely to induce, directly or indirectly, the purchase in or having an effect upon commerce of food, drugs, devices, services, or cosmetics.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 52. Prior to addressing whether the DCO materials are false, within the meaning of Section 12, it must be determined preliminarily whether the materials constitute: (1) the dissemination of advertisements; (2) for the purpose of inducing, or which are likely to induce, purchases in or affecting commerce; (3) of \"food\" or \"drugs.\" 1. Materials disseminated about the Challenged Products constitute advertisements \"Advertisement\" is not defined in the FTC Act. The ordinary meaning of the word is: The act or process of calling something to the attention of the public; or a public notice, especially \u00b7one published in the press or broadcast over the air. Merriam-Webster' s Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 1993). Black's Law Dictionary defines \"advertisement\" as a \"[n]otice given in a manner designed to attract public attention. Infonnation communicated to the public, or to an individual concerned .... \" Black's Law Dictionary 54 (6th ed. 1990) (citation omitted). See also B & B Coastal Enters., Inc. v. Demers, 276 F. Supp. 2d 155, 159 n.3 (D. Me. 2003) (noting that local ordinance regulating advertising signs applied to any sign which \"directs attention to the type of business or profession conducted, as well as to a commodity or service, sold, offered, or manufactured ... \"f -As discussed below, the evidence amply demonstrates that the DCO materials at issue in this case constitute the dissemination of \"advertisements\" for purposes of Section 12. First, infonnation about the Challenged Products is disseminated to the public, over the Internet, through the websites www.danielchapterone.com, www.7herbfonnula.com, www.gdu2000.com, www.dc1pages.com, and www.dc1store.com. F. 158,161. Consumers can locate the DCO Website by entering the tenn \"cancer\" in a Google search. F. 162. In addition, infonnation about the Challenged Products is disseminated to the public through printed materials, also available on the DCO Website, including the BioGuide, the Cancer Newsletter, and ''The Most Simple Guide.\" F. 163-64, 169-70, 172. Infonnation about the Challenged Products is also disseminated to the public through BioMolecular Nutrition Product Catalog, F. 91, 154. Finally, information about the Challenged Products is disseminated to the public, via the Monday through Friday, two hour radio program, \"Daniel Chapter One HealthWatch.\" F. 175-77. The infonnation provided through these media promotes the Challenged Products. Respondent Feijo admits that DCO advertises on the DCO Website. F. 161. DCO's printed materials also promote the attributes of the Challenged Products. For example, the \"Most Simple Guide\" describes the Challenged Products as \"essential for cancer.\" F. 192. The DCO websites, 79 the BioGuide, and the Cancer Newsletter promote the products through product descriptions and testimonials. F. 179-80, 183-88, 190, 195, 197-201,203-10. The BioMolecular Nutrition Product Catalog also describes and promotes the characteristics of the Challenged Products. F. 91, 233, 256, 279. Finally, the radio program uses \"health advice\" to promote the products. F.213-17. Accordingly, the DCO materials constitute \"advertisements\" within the scope of Section 12 of the FfC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 52. 2. The advertisements are for the purpose of inducing, and did induce, purchases of the Challenged Products in or affecting commerce As noted in Section III B 7 above, Respondents' contention that their products are offered for suggested donations and not for purchase is contrary to the evidence. The DCO Website contains icons inviting consumers to \"Buy Now.\" For example, the DCO Website touts the purported benefits of BioShark immediately adjacent to a link urging the viewer to \"BUY NOW!\" F. 106,221. The BioGuide, Cancer Newsletter, and \"Most Guide\" all prominently feature DCO's toll-free call center number. F. 90,94, 163, 167, 174. Consumers are also given the toll-free call center number on the DCO radio program. F. 102, 111. In addition, DCO has spent money on advertising its products. F. 159-60. In these circumstances, it is clear that Respondents' advertisements are \"intended to\" induce sales. Moreover, there is no question that DCO in fact made sales, F. 9,\" 80-81 ,and. that its sales are \"in or affecting commerce.\" See F. 218; supra Section III B 7. 3. The Challenged Products are food and/or drugs \"Food\" and \"drug,\" for the purposes of Section 12, are defined in the FfC Act as follows: (b) Food. The term \"food\" means (1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article. (c) Drug. The term \"drug\" means (1) articles recognized in the official United States Pharmacopoeia, official Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, or official National Formulary, or any supplement to any of them; and (2) articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and (3) articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any fimction of the body of man or other animals; and (4) articles intended for use as a component of any article specified in clause (1), (2), or (3); but does not include devices or their components, parts, or accessories. 15 U.S.c. \u00a7 55(b), (c). Courts and the Commission have routinely treated dietary supplements as within the scope of Section 12. See FTC v. National Urological Group, Inc., No. 1:04-CV-3294, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44145 (N.D. Ga. June 4,2008); FTC v. Direct Marketing Concepts, Inc., 569 F. Supp. 2d 285,297 (D. Mass. 2008); FTC v. Garvey, 383 F.3d 891 (9th Cir. 2004); Shafe v. FTC, 80 256 F.2d 661,663 (6th Cir. 1958). There is no dispute that the Challenged Products are dietary supplements. RFF 11; Answer 'ill[ 6, 8, 10, 12. In accordance with the foregoing authorities, such articles constitute \"food\" andlor \"drug[s)\" within the scope of Section 12. See In re General Nutrition, Inc., No. 9175,113 F.T.C. 146, 1986 FTC LEXIS 74, at *4 (Feb. 24,1986) (finding that, as advertised, dietary supplement tablets, \"Healthy Greens,\" constituted a \"food\" and \"drug\" within the meaning of Section 12 of the FTC Act). D. Respondents' Advertising Is Deceptive or Misleading An \"advertisement is deceptive under the Act if it is likely to mislead consumers, acting reasonably under the circumstances, in a material respect.\" Kraft, Inc. v. FTC, 970 F.2d 311, 314 (7th Cir. 1992) (citing In re Thompson Medical Co., No. 9149, 104 F.T.C 648, 788, 1984 FTC LEX IS 6, at *311 (Nov. 23, 1984), aff'd, 791 F.2d 189 (D.C. Cir. 1986); In re Cliffdale No. 9156, 103 F.T.C. 110, 164-66, 1984 FTC LEXIS 71, at *104 (Mar. 23, 1984)). See also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 55(a)(1) (defining \"false advertisement\" as an advertisement \"which is misleading in a material respect\"). Proof of intent to deceive is not required, and \"the subjective good faith of the advertiser is not a valid defense.\" FTC v. Sabai, 32 F. Supp. 2d 1004, 1007 (N.D. Ill. 1998); FTC v. World Travel Vacation Brokers, Inc., 861 F.2d 1020, 1029 (7th Cir. 1988). In determining whether advertising is deceptive, the Commission engages in a three-part inquiry to determine: (1) whether the advertisements convey the claims alleged; (2) whether the claims are false or misleading; and (3) whether the claims are material to prospective consumers. Kraft v. FTC, 970 F.2d at 314; FTC v. Pantron I Corp., 33 F.3d 1088, 1095 (9th Cir. 1994); FTC v. Direct Marketing Concepts, 569 F~Supp. 2d at 297. Applying that three-part inquiry to this case, it is clear that Respondents' advertising is deceptive. 1. The DCO advertisements make the claims alleged in the Complaint The Complaint alleges that Respondents disseminated advertisements which claim that the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer. Complaint 'ill[ 5, 7, 9, 11, 13. The Complaint further charges that Respondents' advertisements represent that: Complaint,)[ 14. Bio*Shark inhibits tumor growth; Bio*Shark is effective in the treatment of cancer; 7 Herb Formula is effective in the treatment or cure of cancer; 7 Herb Formula inhibits tumor formation; GDU eliminates tumors; GDU is effective in the treatment of cancer; BioMixx is effective in the treatment of cancer; and BioMixx heals the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy. 81 Respondents contend that DCO's advertising does not use the words \"diagnose, mitigate, cure or prevent,\" that their \"express statements\" about the Challenged Products describe the products' effects on the \"structure or function\" of the body, and that their \"claims\" consist of the language of the various product descriptions in their advertising. RPFF Nos. 22-26; see also RRFF No. 153 (replying that the \"statement cited ... specifically does not state that the products can cure, treat or prevent cancer\"); RB at 9 (\"Nowhere on the face of the actual statements by Respondents do Respondents state that their products diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure or prevent a specific disease or class of diseases ... \"). Respondents' arguments disregard both the law and common sense, which recognize that claims may be either express or implied. In re Kraft, Inc., No. 9208, 114 F.T.C. 40, 120,1991 FTC LEXIS 38, at *10 (Jan. 30, 1991), aff'd, 970 F.2d 311 (7th Cir. 1992); In re Thompson Medical, 104 F.T.C. at 788,1984 FTC LEXIS 6, at *311. While express claims directly state the representation at issue, implied claims do so in an oblique or indirect way. Kraft v. FTC, 970 F.2d at 318 n.4; In re Thompson Medical, 104 F.T.C. at 788, 1984 FTC LEXIS 6, at *312 (\"Implied claims are any claims that are not express.\"). The primary evidence of the claims an advertisement conveys to reasonable consumers is the advertisement itself. In re Telebrands Corp., No. 9313,140 F.T.C. 278, 290, 2005 FTC LEXIS 178 (Sept. 19,2005), affd, 457 F.3d 354 (4th Cir. 2006); In re Novartis Corp., No. 9279, 127 F.T.C. 580, 680, 1999 FTC LEXIS 90, at *37-38 (May 13, 1999); In re Kraft, 1991 FTC LEXIS 38, at *12. Moreover, the Commissi\"on looks to the overall net impression created by the advertisement as a whole, by examining the interaction of all of the different elements in the advertisement, rather than focusing on the individual elements in isolation. American Home Prods. Corp. v. FTC, 695 F.2d 681, 687 (3d Cir. 1982); In re Kraft, 1991 FTC LEXIS 38, at *14; In re Thompson Medical, 104 F.T.C. at 323 n.17, 1984 FTC LEXIS 6, at *324 n.17. \"[T]he cardinal factor is the probable effect which the advertiser's handiwork will have upon the eye and mind of the reader. It is therefore necessary in these cases to consider the advertisement in its entirety and not to engage in disputatious dissection. The entire mosaic should be viewed rather than each tile separately. 'The buying public does not ordinarily carefully study or weigh each word in an advertisement. .. .''' FTC v. Sterling Drug, Inc., 317 F.2d 669,674 (2d Cir. 1963) (quoting Aronberg v. FTC, 132 F.2d 165, 167 (7th Cir. 1942)). Assessing the overall net impression of an advertisement includes examining the interaction of such elements as language and visual images. In re Telebrands, 140 F.T.C. at 290; In re Kraft, 1991 FTC LEXIS 38, at *13. Testimonials are also a key element in the overall net impression of an advertisement. FTC v. Bronson Partners, LLC, 564 F. Supp. 2d 119, 125 (D. Conn. 2008) (\"[W]hen an advertisement contains a testimonial reflecting the experience of an individual with a product; there is an implicit representation that such experience reflects the typical or ordinary results anyone may anticipate from use of the product. \") (quoting Porter & Dietsch, Inc., 90 F.T.c. 770, 1977 FTC LEXIS 11, at *147 (1977)). Testimonials not only make representations about the advertised product, but also reinforce representations implied through other elements of the advertisement. See FTC v. QT, Inc., 448 F. Supp. 2d at 920-21,929-32. In addition, an advertisement may convey numerous representations, and the same advertising elements may be amenable to more than one reasonable interpretation. In re Kraft, 82 1991 FTC LEXIS 38, at *11 n.8; In re Thompson Medical, 104 FT.C. at 789 n.7, 1984 FTC LEXIS 6, at *312 n.7. Moreover, the representations alleged in the Complaint need not be the only reasonable interpretations of the challenged advertising. In re Kraft, 1991 FTC LEXIS 38, at *11 n.8; In re Thompson Medical, 104 F.T.C. at 789 n.7, 1984 FTC LEXIS 6, at *312 n.7; In re Bristol-Myers Co., 102 FT.C. at 320, 1983 FTC LEXIS 64, at *249. In addition, \"[ s ]tatements susceptible of both a misleading and a truthful interpretation will be construed against the advertiser.\" FTC v. Bronson Partners, 564 F. Supp. 2d at 127 n.6 (quoting Country Tweeds, Inc. v. FTC, 326 F.2d 144, 148 (2d Cir. 1964)). As more fully discussed below, based on the overall net impression of the DCO advertisements for the Challenged Products, taken as a whole, the advertisements make the claims alleged in the Complaint. If not expressly made, these claims are clearly implied through the interaction of the advertising's words, visual images, and testimonials. In some cases, the representations are so strongly implied as to be virtually synonymous with express claims. a. Claims regarding the Challenged Products collectively (1) \"Cancer News\" webpage on www.danielchapterone.com DCO advertises the Challenged Products as a group on the DCa Website on a page entitled \"Cancer News.\" F 179-88. Viewing the Cancer News webpage as a whole, the claim that the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer is so strongly implied as to be virtually express. F 189. First, the title of the page, in Q~old type, is \"Cancer News.\" F 179. Then, the opening paragraph recommends the Challenged Products \"[i]f you suffer from any type of cancer.\" F. 180. Next, the Challenged Products are prominently featured in a photograph adjacent to the bold type phrase \"Daniel Chapter One Cancer Solutions.\" F. 180. Next, adjacent to the text and visual image are bold type instructions to read or listen to testimonials \"about cancer.\" F 182, 186-87. The audio testimonials include such titles as, \"Marie -Dad's tumor cured -7 Herb and more,\" \"Nancy -Cured ~reast Cancer in 3 months - 7 Herb and GDU,\" and \"Robert\u00ad Prostate cured from DC1 products.\" F. 187. Written testimonials also appear on the webpage. F. 182-85. These include statements from \"Tracey,\" a purported cancer patient on whom \"doctors had ... given up,\" that she took BioMixx, 7 Herb Formula, and BioShark, among other DCO products, and that she is \"now in complete remission.\" F 184. Another testimonial states: \"After using 7 Herb and other DC1 products for precancerous growths,\" among other ailments, her X-ray \"showed nothing there.\" F 185. The overall net impression from the interaction of the words, pictures, and testimonials is unmistakable -that the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer. See FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEX IS 44145, at *50-52 (holding that advertisement which included statements that herbal supplement was a \"solution\" for obesity and \"Try Thermalean today and win the battle against obesity\" clearly implied that the herbal supplement was an effective treatment for obesity). 83 (2) \"Cancer Treatment\" advertisement on www.dc1pages.com The Challenged Products are advertised as a group on the DCO website www.dclpages.com. F. 190. The words \"Cancer Treatment,\" in bold and larger type, are featured prominently next to a picture of bottles of the Challenged Products and a listing of their product names. F. 190. The overall net impression of these words and visual images is that the Challenged Products are effective in the treatment of cancer. F. 191. Respondents contend that use of the phrase \"supporting products\" at the top of the webpage \"indicate[ s] that these products are 'supporting products' that can be used in conjunction with cancer treatments, whatever those may be.\" RRFF No. 137. This contention is belied by the words of the advertisement itself, which states: ''To enhance 7 Herb Formula's healing quantities Daniel Chapter One advises to get familiar with the supporting products below.\" F. 190 (emphasis added). It is clear from this language that the only \"cancer treatment\" that the Challenged Products are advertised to \"support\" is DCO's 7 Herb Formula. (3) \"The\"Most Simple Guide to the Most Difficult Diseases\" The Challenged Products are promoted collectively in the DCO publication, ''The Most Simple Guide to the Most Difficult Diseases: The Doctors' How-To Quick Reference Guide.\" F. 192. The page of the Guide that is dedicated to cancer, which word appears in large, bold type, lists the four Challenged Products in bold type, along with dosing instructions, such as: \"7*Herb Formula TM 2 ounces in juice or water (minimum intake) 2 times daily.\" F. 192. Each product listing is preceded by a \"sun\" symbol which, according to the advertisement, means that this product is \"essential\"Ior cancer. F. 192. Through the interaction of these words and visual images, the message that the Challenged Products treat or cure cancer is so strongly implied as to be virtually express. F. 193. (4) Cancer Newsletter The Cancer Newsletter, viewed as a whole, conveys the overall net impression that the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer. First, the title of the publication, \"How to fight cancer is your choice,\" F. 194, sets the stage by strongly implying, if not expressly stating, that the products described in the newsletter will \"fight\" cancer. See FTC v. NationalUrological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEX IS 44145, at *50-52 (holding that advertisement which included statement regarding herbal supplement, \"Try Thermalean today and win the battle against obesity\" clearly implied that the herbal supplement was an effective treatment for obesity). In addition, the preface to the Cancer Newsletter quotes a book entitled \"Back to Eden,\" in which the writer states that his \"cure for cancer\" includes herbs. This in tum implies that the herbal supplements featured in the Cancer Newsletter can cure cancer. F. 196. Against this backdrop, featuring the Challenged Products, as four of only eight products featured in the Cancer Newsletter, implies that the Challenged Products treat or cure cancer. F. 195, 197,202. 84 Further creating and reinforcing this overall net impression are the numerous testimonials to the successful use of the Challenged Products for cancer. F. 197-201. While there are only eight product descriptions, there are seventeen testimonials, which at times appear two to a page. The testimonial titles stand out in large, bold type: \"Lump is gone without dangerous surgery!,\" \"7 cancer,\" \"7 \"Ancient cancer \"Doctors gave up man,\" \"Pre-Cancerous Growths & and Heartburn,\" \"Tumor Free!,\" and \"Declared Free of Cancer.\" F. 198. The testimonials include such statements as: \"I started taking the 7 Herb and that tumor was shrinking ... there has been massive tumor shrinkage.\" F. 199 (\"Doctors gave up on Michigan man\"); ''Tricia convinced [them] that [the] best hope was to take natural remedies rather than go under the knife . . .. The growth is gone .... \" F. 199 (\"Cancer Success a Lie!\"); and, \"With stage 4 cancer and given only 6 months to live, Joe's dad was not doing well .... With 4 ounces of 7*Herb a day, in just 2 days ... the family watched dad's color come back. ... GDU to the rescue! ... PSA 3.3, no pain, alive .... \" F. 199 (\"Not too late!\"). By including the Challenged Products prominently and referring to them in the testimonials, the Cancer Newsletter implies that the Challenged Products, individually or in combination with one another, prevent, tn~~t~ or cwe c_ancer. F. 202. (5) BioGuide Like the Cancer Newsletter, the BioGuide makes prominent, overwhelming use of testimonials claiming the successful use of the Challenged Products for cancer. F.203. The clear implication of the BioGuide, tllrough the words, photographs, and testimonials in particular, is that the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer. F. 211. For example, on the page immediatelyJollowing an advertisement for 7 Herb Formula, there is a picture of a smiling woman and the heading in large, colored, and bold type, \"Cancer Brain Tumor.\" Next to that entry is the colored, italicized text: The doctors had pretty much given up on Tracey. She had leukemia and tumors on the brain, behind the heart and on her liver. The testimonial then claims that the speaker took \"BIOMIXX and 7 HERB FORMULA,\" which resulted in \"complete relI!ission.\" It further claims that a tumor above the brain stem \"completely disappeared,\" a \"tumor on my liver is shrinking and the tumor behind my heart has shrunk over 50% .... \" F. 204. Similarly styled claims, complete with photographs of smiling people, are made in testimonials entitled: \"Lowered PSA,\" in which the speaker announces the \"GOOD NEWS\" of a lowered PSA, and states his belief that 7 Herb Formula and GDU \"did the trick,\" F. 205; \"Prostate Cancer,\" in which the author claims that he took 7 Herb Formula and BioMixx, has a lowered PSA, and plans to \"stay on [7 Herb Formula] forever!\" apparently to keep his cancer at 85 bay, F. 206; and \"Renal Cell Cancer,\" in which the speaker claims to be taking 7 Herb Formula, GDU, and BioShark, and that \"no further activity\" in his kidney tumor has occurred. F. 207. The BioGuide also includes a testimonial from a doctor who claims to have given 7 Herb Formula, BioShark, and GDU to his own child and claims the child's tumor has \"begun to shrink .... Four months later the whole family is using the products, as well as my patients,\" F. 209, with the clear implication that these products have the ability not only to cure cancer, but to prevent it as well. Read as a whole, through the interaction of the product descriptions, the visual images, such as highlighted text and photographs, and the testimonials, the BioGuide clearly implies, if not expressly states, that the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer. F. 211. b. Claims regarding BioShark (1) Website advertising The product description of BioShark on the DCO Website states in pertinent part: Pure skeletal tissue of sharks which provides a protein that inhibits angiogenesis -the formation of new blood vessels. This can stop tumor growth, and halt the progressIon or eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration .... F.221. Respondents assert that the foregoing statements comprise their entire advertising \"claim\" for BioShark. See RPFF No. 22. Even standing alone, the product description, through the use of such phrases as \"inhibits angiogenesis\" and \"can stop tumor growth,\" strongly implies that BioShark inhibits tumors. F. 222. The language does not stand alone, however, and must be interpreted in the context of the other elements of the advertisement to determine the overall net impression. See American Home Prods. v. FTC, 695 F.2d at 687 (stating that advertisement must be interpreted as a whole, without emphasizing isolated words or phrases apart from their context). In this advertisement, the product webpage specifically promotes BioShark, in bold letters, for ''Tumors & Cysts.\" F. 221. Adjacent to the product description is the message: \"Read our clients [sic] testimonials on BioShark & Tumors,\" and a link to a bulleted title, \"Cancerous Tumor.\" F. 221. At the bottom of the webpage is a link to \"Stop Tumor Growth & Cysts Top.\" F. 221. Considering these additional elements, the overall net impression of the product webpage for BioShark is that BioShark inhibits cancerous tumors and is an effective treatment for cancer. F.224. Adding to the overall net impression of the DCO Website that BioShark inhibits cancerous tumors and is an effective treatment for cancer, is that BioShark is featured as one of the \"cancer solutions\" for \"any type of cancer\" on the Cancer News webpage. F. 180. The website www.dc1pages.com also expressly advertises BioShark, along with the other Challenged Products, as a \"Cancer Treatment.\" F. 190. 86 Further adding to that overall net impression is the following statement, set forth under the BioShark heading, which implies that BioShark inhibits tumors: \"In 1983, two researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a study showing that shark cartilage contains a substance that significantly inhibits the development of blood vessels that nourish solid tumors, thereby limiting tumor growth. This effect is called anti-angiogenesis.\" F.225. It is not a defense that the advertisements attempt to tie claims to the constituent ingredients of BioShark, i.e., \"skeletal tissue of sharks\" and \"shark cartilage,\" as opposed to BioShark itself because, despite this word parsing, the overall net impression is that Respondents' claims pertain to the BioShark product itself. See FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44145, at *53-55 (holding that even though express language of the advertising attempted to tie a claim to components of herbal supplement product and not to the product itself, the overall net impression was a claim as to the effectiveness of the product itself). (2) Cancer Newsletter The overall net impression from the Cancer Newsletter is that BioShark inhibits tumors and is effective in the treatment of cancer..F 232. BioShark is among the products that the Newsletter's title represents will \"fight\" cancer. F. 195, 197. Moreover, BioShark is specifically included in numerous testimonials. E.g., F. 184 (\"7 Herb Formula battles cancer\" (\"[M]y father sent me BIOMIXX and 7 HERB FORMULA. Each day as I took it and got it into my system more and more, the better I felt. Then I added Garlic Pur, Siberian Ginseng, and Bio*Shark. I am now in complete remission.\")); F. 200 (\"Texas businessman has true friends for life\" (Friends send a bladder cancer sufferer a package that \"included 7 Herb Formula ... Bio*Shark and Bio*Mixx\"), and \"Tumor Free!\" (claiming that brain cancer sufferer takes \"7 HERB FORMULA ... BIO MIXX, BIO SHARK, and GDD Caps: . \" [T]he tumors were completely gone.\")). In addition, the Cancer Newsletter includes representations implying that BioShark has been scientifically proven to inhibit tumors, repeating the statement from the Cancer News webpage on the DCO Website: \"In 1983, two researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a study showing that shark cartilage contains a substance that significantly inhibits the development of blood vessels that nourish solid tumors, thereby limiting tumor growth. This effect is called anti-angiogenesis.\" F.231. Adding to and strengthening this impression is the placement of this paragraph in the midst of the large, bold, and highlighted type testimonial titles, \"Doctors gave up on Michigan Man\" and \"Pre-Cancerous Growth & Acid and Heartburn.\" F. 231. (3) BioGuide The BioGuide contains the same product description for BioShark as that found on its product webpage on the DCO Website. F. 221, 228. For the same reasons as those stated above, that product description strongly implies that BioShark inhibits tumors. F. 229. Adding to and 87 reinforcing that implied claim are the testimonials, complete with photographs of smiling people, claiming that BioShark effectively treated cancer. For example, the testimonial \"Cancer Brain Tumor\" includes the statement: \"[M]y father sent me BIOMIXX and 7 HERB FORMULA. Each day as I took it and got it into my system more and more, the better I felt. Then I added Garlic, Siberian Ginseng, and BioShark. I am now in complete remission.\" F. 204. Similarly, the testimonial entitled \"Renal Cell Cancer\" includes the following: \"I had Renal Cell Cancer in my left kidney, with a tumor attached that was slightly larger than a baseball. I went on 7 Herb Formula and GDD .... I continue to drink the 7-Herb and take Bio-Shark, and GDU .... [N]o further activity has occurred.\" F. 207. Another testimonial \"After switching to DCl products -7-Herb Formula, BioShark, GDD, Garlic Pur, Siberian Ginseng, Ezekiel Oil and BioMixx -[the skin cancer] cleared up quickly .... [T]hree weeks ago [1] was told I was completely clear of all types of cancer.\" F. 208. Accordingly, the BioGuide, taken as a whole, through the interaction of the product descriptions, the visual images such as highlighted text and photographs, and the testimonials, not only represents that BioShark inhibits tumor growth, but that BioShark prevents, treats, or cures cancer. F. 230. (4) BioMolecular Nutrition Product Catalog The BioMolecular Nutrition ProduGt Catalog includes a similar product description for BioShark as that set forth on the DCO Website and in the BioGuide, stating: \"Shark Cartilage protein inhibits angiogenesis, stops tumor growth, and halts eye diseases. Reduces pain, inflammation, joint stiffness of arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and reverses psoriasis. Affects the formation of new blood vessels.\" F. 233; see F. 221, 228. The overall net impression of this description is that BioShark inhibits tumor growth. F. 235. Indeed, the phrase \"stops tumor growth\" expressly clauns that BioShark inhibits tumor growth. F.234. c. . Claims regarding 7 Herb Formula (1) Website advertising The product page for 7 Herb Formula includes in the description, \"purify the blood and promote cell repair. The ingredients in this tea concentrate work to clear skin, cleanse the liver, decrease cell mutation, and fight pathogenic bacteria and tumor formation.\" F. 237. The product is also featured on the Cancer News webpage of the DCO Website with a similar description, stating that 7 Herb Formula \"purifies the blood, promotes cell repair, fights tumor formation [and] fights pathogenic bacteria.\" F.238. Respondents focus on these statements, asserting that the statements comprise their website \"claim\" regarding 7 Herb Formula. Relying on these statements alone, Respondents assert that they did not claim that 7 Herb Formula treats, cures, or prevents cancer. RPFF No. 23. Contrary to Respondents' position, such statements as \"fights tumor formation\" and \"decrease[s] cell mutation,\" by themselves clearly do imply that 7 Herb Formula inhibits tumors and treats cancer. F. 239. Moreover, the words do not appear in isolation, but interact with other elements in the advertisement. First, the product description appears under a bold type heading including the 88 words \"Cancer Help.\" F. 237. Next, a picture of the product with its description appears first on the Cancer News webpage, where the phrase \"fights tumor formation\" is highlighted in bold type. F.238. Next, after the product description and a photograph of the product along with the other Challenged Products, is the admonition, \"How to fight cancer is your choice!\" F. 240. In addition, there are links to testimonials \"about cancer,\" with titles that include specific references to 7 Herb Formula, such as \"7 Herb Formula 'battles cancer\" and \"7 Herb eliminates pre\u00ad cancerous growth.\" F.241. These elements interact to create a strong impression that 7 Herb Formula not only inhibits tumor growth, but is an effective treatment for cancer. The text of testimonials strengthens this impression. For example, in the testimonial entitled \"7 Herb Formula Battles Cancer,\" the speaker claims taking 7 Herb Formula, among other DCO products, for cancer and experiencing a \"complete remission,\" thereby creating the impression that 7 Herb Formula cured her. F. 184; see also F. 243 (describing Michigan man's claim of taking 7 Herb Formula and experiencing \"massive tumor shrinkage\"). In addition, the testimonial entitled \"7 Herb Eliminates Pre-cancerous Growth\" states in part, \"I had a pre\u00ad cancerous 'wart' on the back of my leg and drinking 7 Herb Formula made it go away,\" thereby creating the impression that 7 Herb Formula prevents cancer. F. 242. Other material on the DCO Websi~~ further contributes to the overall net impression that 7 Herb Formula is an effective cancer treatment. The Cancer News webpage article, \"Ancient Cancer Remedy is hnproved Upon,\" includes statements that \"Jim improved upon the ancient Ojibway Indian Tribe remedy known as Essiac .... As a result of his research, Jim found that by adding Siberian Ginseng and Cat's Claw to the Essiac formula, he could attain remarkable healing results .... \" F. 242; see also F. 244 (\"With Jim Feijo's addition to the [7 Herb] formula, we now have the most effective and~potent formula available in the battle against tumors.\"). Such statements clearly imply, if not expressly represent, that 7 Herb is an effective cancer remedy. See FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44145, at *51-52 (holding that advertisement which included statements that herbal supplement was the \"most complete ... nutriceutical ever developed for the diet industry\" implied that the herbal supplement was an effective treatment for obesity). The DCO website www.dc1pages.com expressly advertises 7 Herb Formula, along with the other Challenged Products, as a \"Cancer Treatment\" and specifically refers to its \"healing qualities.\" F. 190. In addition, the question and answer portion of this site, similar to that on the DCO Website, makes the claim that 7 Herb Formula is the \"most effective and potent formula available in the battle against tumors,\" F. 246, and therefore similarly represents that 7 Herb Formula is an effective cancer remedy. See FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEX IS 44145, at *51-52 (holding that advertisement which included statements that herbal supplement product was the \"most complete ... nutraceutical ever developed for diet industry\" implied that the herbal supplement was an effective treatment for obesity). Finally, the website www.dc1pages.com states that 7 Herb Formula has been used in cancer clinics and provided in doctor's offices, thereby creating the impression that 7 Herb Formula is a cancer treatment. F. 247. Viewed in its entirety, the overall net impression of the advertising for 7 Herb Formula on 89 www.delpages.comis that the product inhibits tumors and is effective for the treatment of cancer. F. 248. (2) Cancer Newsletter The product description for 7 Herb Formula in the Cancer Newsletter states that 7 Herb Formula \"fights ... tumor formation.\" F. 251. Accordingly, the advertisement clearly implies that the product inhibits tumor formation. Combined with the statements that \"7 Herb Formula has been created to ... promote cell repair ... fights pathogenic bacteria ... [t]he ingredients ... decrease cell mutation,\" the product description also implies that 7 Herb Formula is effective in treating cancer. F. 251, 255. The advertisement also states, immediately below the product description under a heading, in large, bold type, \"esophageal cancer?\" that the ingredients of 7 Herb Formula \"may prevent and even heal cancer.\" F. 252. These statements strongly imply, if not expressly state, that 7 Herb Formula prevents or cures cancer. See FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44145, at *53-55 (holding that even though the express language of advertising attempted to tie a claim to components of herbal supplement product and not to the product itself, overall net impression was a claim as to the effectiveness of the product itself). ' Moreover, the above product descriptions must be interpreted with reference to other elements of the Cancer Newsletter. First, 7 Herb Formula is included among the eight products that the Cancer Newsletter's title represents will \"fight\" cancer. F. 195, 197. In fact, the Cancer Newsletter particularly highlights 7 Herb Formula, devoting an entire page to the product and prominently featuring its logo. F. 251. In addition, several testimonial titles specifically refer to 7 Herb Formula. E.g., F. 184 (\"7 Hero Formula battles cancer\");.I;. 198 (\"7 Herb Formula Eliminates Pre-Cancerous Growth\"); F. 253 (same); F. 204 (\"My father sent me BIOMIXX and 7 HERB FORMULA. Each day as I took it and got it into my system more and more, the better I felt. ... I am now in complete remission\"); F. 242 (\"I had a pre-cancerous 'wart' on the back of my leg and drinking 7 Herb Formula made it go away\"); and F. 253 (\"7 Herb Formula Helps Battle Cancer\" (\"Within 60 days [of being on 7 Herb Formula] PSAlevel dropped from to 5 .... [Thereafter, n]o evidence of ... tumor.\"\u00bb. The interaction of all of the elements of the Cancer Newsletter, including the title of the publication, the prominent featuring of 7 Herb Formula in text, visual imagery, and testimonials, and the content of the product descriptions and testimonials, creates an overall net impression that 7 Herb Formula inhibits tumors and is effective to prevent, treat, or cure cancer. F.255. (3) BioGuide The product description for 7 Herb Formula in the BioGuide, mirroring that on the DCa Website, includes the statements: \"Herbs to purify the blood and promote cell repair. The ingredients in this tea concentrate work to clear skin, cleanse the liver, decrease cell mutation, and fight pathogenic bacteria and tumor formation.\" F. 237, 249. As on the DCO Website, these statements do not stand alone. 90 The product description is repeated twice in the three pages devoted to 7 Herb Formula. F. 249. Moreover, in between these pages is a page containing two testimonials to 7 Herb Formula. The first testimonial, \"Cancer Brain Tumor,\" shows a smiling woman next to text highlighting the use of 7 Herb Formula in sending her cancer into \"complete remission\" and shrinking other tumors. F.249. The placement and title of the second testimonial, \"Lowered PSA,\" itself implies that 7 Herb Formula is related to the reported improvement in that cancer indicator. The testimonial features a photograph of a smiling man and text expressly stating the speaker's belief that the DCa products he took, including 7 Herb Formula, \"did the trick.\" F. 205. Other testimonials in the BioGuide make similar claims as to the effectiveness of 7 Herb Formula to prevent, treat, or cure cancer. See, e.g., F. 206 (testimonial entitled \"Prostate Cancer,\" stating that the speaker took 7 Herb Formula \"every day .... [It] did such a good job fighting cancer, 2 ounces is a good prophylaxis!\"); F. 207 (testimonial entitled \"Renal Cell Cancer,\" stating that the speaker with cancerous kidney tumor went on 7 Herb Formula and the oncologist is \"amazed that no further activity has occurred\"); F.208 (testimonial entitled \"Skin Cancer,\" in which the speaker switches to Dca products, including 7 Herb Formula, and is \"completely clear of all types of cancer\"). The overall net impression from the BioGuide; through the interaction of the words of the product descriptions, the visual images such as highlighted text and photographs, and the testimonials, is that 7 Herb Formula inhibits tumors and is effective to prevent, treat, or cure cancer. F. 250. (4) ~ ~~BioMolecular Nutrition Product Catalog The BioMolecular Nutrition Product Catalog describes 7 Herb Formula in virtually the same manner as the DCOWebsite, the BioGuide, and the Cancer Newsletter, stating that the herbs in 7 Herb Formula \"purify the blood and promote cell repair, clear skin, cleanse the liver, decrease cell mutation, [and] fight pathogenic bacteria and tumor formation.\" F. 237,249,251, 256. As noted above, use of the phrase, \"fights ... tumor formation\" strongly implies, if not expressly states, that the product inhibits tumor formation. Combined with the phrases \"promote cell repair,\" \"decrease cell mutation,\" and \"fight pathogenic bacteria,\" the product description as a whole implies that 7 Herb Formula is effective in treating cancer. See FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 u.S. Dist. LEXIS 44145, at *53-55 (holding that even though express language of advertising attempted to tie a claim to components of herbal supplement product and not to the product itself, overall net impression was a claim as to the effectiveness of the product itself). d. Claims regarding GDU (1) Website advertising The product page for GDU on the DCO Website includes statements that the ingredients of GDU \"digest protein -even that of unwanted tumors and cysts\" and that GDU is used \"as an 91 adjunct to cancer therapy.\" F.262-63. These statements imply that GOD inhibits tumors and is a cancer treatment. F.264. In addition, the product webpage has links to testimonials with various cancer-related titles, including, \"Breast Mass\" and \"Prostate Cancer.\" F. 265. The interaction of the product description and cancer-related testimonial titles gives this DCO Website advertisement a strong overall net impression that GOD not only inhibits tumors, but is an effective cancer treatment or cure. F. 269. Other features on the OCO Website strengthen this impression. GOU is featured as a \"Cancer Solution\" for \"any type of cancer\" on the Cancer News webpage on the OCO Website, further reinforcing the implication that GOD is an effective cancer treatment. F. 266. Testimonials on that webpage, or linked to the webpage, also claim that taking GOU, along with other OCO products, effectively treated cancer. F. 267; F. 268 (\"Nancy -Cured Breast Cancer in 3 months -7 Herb and GOU\" and \"Mel-Breast Mass [illegible] and GOU\"). This website advertising also creates the impression that GOU is an effective cancer treatment. F. 269. The OCO website www.dc1pages.com also claims that GOU is an effective treatment by expressly advertising GOD, among the other Challenged Products, as a \"Cancer Treatment.\" F. 190. ' (2) Cancer Newsletter The product description for GOU in the Cancer Newsletter appears under the headline in large, bold type: \"Enzymes attack growths.\" F. 276. The advertisement goes on to explain how the enzymes in GOU \"can aid the body in breaking down a tumor.\" F.276. It emphasizes the importance of enzymes \"in treating cancer,\" stating that such enzymes can return leukemia cells \"to a normal state,\" and help \"to destroy cancer cells.\" F. 276. While these statements ostensibly refer only to the enzyme ingredient in GOU, they impliedly represent that GOU itself has these cancer treating qualities. F.277. See FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Oist. LEXIS 44145, at *53-55 (holding that overall net impression was a claim as to the effectiveness of the product itself, even though express language of advertising attempted to tie claims to components of herbal supplement product and not to the product itself). Even though the language of the product description for GOU in the Cancer Newsletter attempts to relegate GOU's claimed effectiveness to a supporting role in \"helping\" or \"aiding\" the body, \"[t]he entire mosaic should be viewed rather than each tile separately.\" FTC v. Sterling Drug, 317 F.2d at 674. In this case, the entire mosaic of the advertisement belies a merely \"supporting\" role for GOU. The overall net impression is that GOU itself inhibits tumors and is an effective cancer treatment. F. 278. GOU is one of the eight products that the Cancer Newsletter's title represents will \"fight\" cancer. F. 195, 197. The product description appears under the heading in large, bold type: \"Enzymes attack growths.\" F.276. Adjacent to the GOU headline, photograph, and product description are two testimonials with large type, highlighted and bold headlines: \"Lump is gone without dangerous surgery\" and \"Cancer Success a Lie!\" F. 276. Other testimonials in the 92 Cancer Newsletter claim that taking ODU, along with other DCO products, effectively treats cancer. F. 200 (\"Tumor Free!\" claims brain cancer sufferer takes \"7 HERB FORMULA ... , BIO MIXX, BIO SHARK, and ODU Caps ... [and thereafter] the tumors were completely gone\"); and F. 199 (\"Not too late!\" in which a stage-four cancer patient with six months to live announces, \"GDU to the rescue!\"). The interaction of all of the elements of the Cancer Newsletter, including the title of the publication, the featuring of GDU, the product description headline and text, and the titles and content of its testimonials, creates an overall net impression that GDU inhibits tumors and is an effective cancer treatment. F.278. (3) BioGuide The BioGuide features the product description for GDU on two pages. F. 270. The descriptions track those on the DCa Website and in the Cancer Newsletter, stating that GDU contains enzymes \"to help digest protein -even that of unwanted tumors and cysts,\" and that GDU has a variety of uses, including \"as an adjunct to cancer therapy.\" F. 263, 270-71. T)1e former statement is repeated in large, bold type, thereby emphasizing the purported ability of GDU to \"digest ... tumors and cysts.\" F..271. Taken as a whole, this product description implies that GDU inhibits tumors and implies that GDU is a cancer treatment. F. 272. There are additional elements in the BioGuide that create the overall net impression that GDU inhibits tumors and is an effective treatment for cancer. The product name \"ODU,\" in large, bold type, and the statement, also in large, bold type, regarding its effect on \"tumors and cysts,\" appear above a photograph of a smiling man, and the large, bold type testimonial title, \"Prostate Cancer.\" F. 271. Moreover, testimonials in the BioGuide discuss the use of GDU in treating cancer. For example, on the page immediately following the GDU product description, the testimonial entitled \"Breast Mass\" claims that after discovering a breast mass, the speaker \"began taking GDU six times a day .... I got another bottle of GDU and the Superior Herbal Fat Burners, which I took twice a day. In April I had my 6-month examination and the letter read: 'We are pleased to inform you that the results of your recent breast evaluation are normal. '\" F. 273. Similarly, the testimonial entitled \"Renal Cell Cancer\" describes the speaker's use of GDU for a kidney tumor: \"I went on 7 Herb Formula and GDU .... I continue to drink the 7-Herb and take Bio-Shark, and GDU ..... To date, my oncologist is amazed that no further activity has occurred.\" The latter statement is repeated in large, bold type. F. 207. In addition, the testimonial entitled \"Lowered PSA\" announces the speaker's \"GOOD NEWS\" of a lowered PSA after taking \"7 Herb formula, in combination with your Bio C 1000, GDU and other minerals and vitamins. I believe it was your products that did the trick.\" F. 274; see also F. 208 (\"Skin Cancer\": \"After switching to DCl products -7-Herb Formula, BioShark, Garlic Pur, Siberian Oinseng, Ezekiel Oil and BioMixx -it cleared up quickly ... completely clear of all types of cancer\"); F. 209 (\"My son was diagnosed with a tumor on his left temple .... Jim and Trish ... suggested 7-Herb, BioShark and ODU, which we bought and started him on .... [T]he 93 tumor had already begun to shrink .. :. Four months later the whole family is using the products, as well as my patients, and you would never know my son had a tumor\"); F. 210 (\"One lady, who had a history of cancer, used the 7 Herb Formula, GDU & BioShark and was blessed to get rid of a large breast tumor.\"). The interaction of all of the elements of the BioGuide regarding GDU, including the product descriptions, the visual images, such as highlighted text and photographs, and the testimonials, create the overall net impression that GDU inhibits tumors and is an effective cancer treatment. F. 275. (4) BioMolecular Nutrition Product Catalog The product description for GDU in the BioMolecular Nutrition Product Catalog mirrors that in the other Dca publications, stating that GDU contains enzymes \"to help digest protein, even that of unwanted tumors and cysts. Helps to relieve pain, inflammation, and as an adjunct to cancer therapy.\" F. 263, 270, 276, 279. As stated above, taken as a whole, this product description implies that GDU inhibits tumors and is a cancer treatment. F. 280-81. e. Claims regarding BioMixx (1) Website advertising Both the DCO Website and the website www.dc1pages.comimply that BioMixx is effective in treating or curing cancer. The Cancer News webpage on the DCa Website expressly advertises BioMixx, along with the other Challenged Products, as a \"Cancer Solution\" for \"any type of cancer.\" F.283. The Cancer News webpage also includes a testimonial representing that BioMixx effectively treated cancer: \"I had contracted leukemia and had three inoperable tumors. When I decided not to do chemotherapy or radiation, my father sent me Bio*Mixx and 7 Herb Formula. Each day as I took it and got it into my system more and more, the better I felt. . .. I am now in complete remission.\" F. 284. The website www.dc1pages.com also claims that BioMixx is an effective cancer tre.atment by expressly advertising BioMixx, among the other Challenged Products, as a \"Cancer Treatment.\" F.285. (2) Cancer Newsletter The product description for BioMixx in the Cancer Newsletter claims that BioMixx \"is used to assist the body in fighting cancer and in healing the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments.\" F.293. As with the similar word parsing used for the product descriptions for GDU (see F. 276), Respondents' attempt to relegate BioMixx's effectiveness to a supporting role in assisting the body fails. It is necessary to consider the advertisement \"in its entirety and not to engage in,disputatious dissection.\" FTC v. Sterling Drug, 317 F.2d at 674. In this case, the \"entire mosaic\" of the Cancer Newsletter creates the overall net impression that BioMixx is an effective cancer treatment and ameliorates the adverse effects of radiation and chemotherapy. F. 294. 94 BioMixx is one of the eight products that the Cancer Newsletter's title represents will \"fight\" cancer. F. 195, 197. In addition, BioMixx is among the products referred to in the testimonial \"7 Herb Formula Battles Cancer,\" in which the speaker is quoted as saying: \"I had contracted leukemia and had three inoperable tumors. When I decided not to do chemotherapy or radiation, my father sent me Bio*Mixx and 7 Herb Formula. Each day as I took it and got it into my system more and more, the better I felt .... I am now in complete remission.\" F. 292. Viewing the Cancer Newsletter as a whole, and considering the interaction of the publication's title, the BioMixx product description, and the testimonial, the overall net impression is that BioMixx is an effective cancer treatment and heals the adverse effects of radiation and chemotherapy. F.294. (3) BioGuide The lengthy product description for BioMixx in the BioGuide states in relevant part that BioMixx \"[h]elps detoxify the body [and] boosts immunity and energy .... What separates BioMixx is that it was developed specifically to maximize the immune system, particularly for those individuals whose immune systems were compromised through chemotherapy and radiation .... This scientifically designed f9rnmlaprovides your body with [herbs and nutrients] ... for cell, organ, and tissue health .... Whether you're losing weight battling illness, or are weakened due to intense training, BioMixx is the best.\" F.287. This description conveys the clear message that BioMixx is an effective treatment for the adverse effects of chemotherapy and radiation. F. 288. By juxtaposing the promotion of BioMixx for this purpose with the promotion of BioMixx for \"cell\" health and to \"battle illness,\" the advertisement also conveys the impression that BioMixx is effective~for cancer. F. 291. The impression that BioMixx is an effective cancer treatment, as well as an antidote to the adverse effects of chemotherapy and radiation, is strengthened by the message of testimonials. For example, the testimonial entitled \"Cancer Brain Tumor\" appears prominently, next to a photo of a smiling woman, and includes the statements: \"I had contracted leukemia and had three inoperable tumors. When I decided not to do chemotherapy or radiation, my father sent me BIOMJXX and 7 HERB FORMULA. Each day as I took it and got it into my system more and more, the better I felt. ... I am now in complete remission .... \" F. 204, 289. BioMixx is also featured in a prominent testimonial entitled \"Prostate Cancer,\" which states in part: \"I had beam radiation for prostate cancer. I also took 7 Herb Formula ... and BioMixx; I never had a bad day, nevt?r felt sick. When my PSA went from 7.6 to 0.5 in the month after I finished radiation, my doctor was surprised. Several months later it was down to 0.16!\" F. 290. Viewed as a whole, considering the product descriptions, the visual images, such as highlighted text and photographs, and the testimonials, the BioGuide conveys the overall net impression that BioMixx is effective in the treatment of cancer and in healing the adverse effects of radiation and chemotherapy. F. 291. 95 f. Disclaimer language . Respondents assert that their website advertising contains the following disclaimer: ''These statements have not been evaluated,by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent disease.\" RFF 16 (citing CX 17 at FIC-DCO 0073, 0076, 0080, 0084,0089,0095,0098). Respondents' cited disclaimer appears on certain shopping cart webpages on the website www.dc1store.com. F.301. Relatively similar disclaimers, but briefer and without the FDA reference, appear on the bottom of certain webpages from www.dc1pages.com.atthebottomofwebpagesondanie1chapterone.com. at the end of the BioGuide, and on the last page of the Cancer Newsletter. F. 296-300. \"Disclaimers or qualifications in any particular ad are not adequate to avoid liability unless they are sufficiently prominent and unambiguous to change the apparent meaning of the claims and to leave an accurate impression. Anything less is only likely to cause confusion by creating contradictory double meanings.\" Removatron Int'l Corp. v. FTC, 884 F.2d 1489,1497 (1st Cir. 1989) (citing Giant Food, Inc. v. FTC, 322 F.2d 977, 986 (D.C. Cir. 1963)); accord FTC v. U.S. Sales Corp., 785 F. Supp. 2d. 737,751 (N.D. Ill. 1992). Applying these standards to evaluate the above disclaimer, as well as similar disclaimers in the DCO advertising materials, it is readily apparent that the disclaimers are ineffective to alter the overall net impression of the advertisements or to leave an accurate impression. The purported disclaimers are not prominent in any advertisement. In each case, the disclaimer appears well after the con\u00a3lusion of the advertising claims. F.296-300. In each instance, the disclaimer appears in type that is the same size, or smaller, than the surrounding type. F. 296-301, 303. The disclaimer in the Cancer Newsletter is virtually infinitesimal. F. 299,303. In each instance, except for the webpages cited by Respondents, the disclaimer is buried in copyright disclosures. F. 296-300. Such small-print disclaim,ers at the bottom of advertisements are insufficient. See FTC v. Medlab, Inc., No. C 08-822 SI, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33917, at *15 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 21, 2009) (\"Defendants cannot inoculate themselves from the representations that appear in the body of the text by including cautionary statements at the foot of the advertisements.\"). Moreover, the language disclaiming any intent to \"treat\" any disease only serves to confuse in this case by interjecting a message that is contradictory to the overall net impression that the Challenged Products do treat cancer. For example, the disclaimer language appearing on one of the pages ofwww.dc1pages.comis followed on the next page, in bold type font far larger than that used for the disclaimer, by language touting: CANCER TREATMENT 7 Herb Formula Bio*Shark BioMixx 96 GDU Caps F. 304. Because the purported disclaimers are not prominent or unambiguous, and create confusion with messages that contradict the advertisements' overall messages, the disclaimers are ineffective. See In re Giant Food, No. 7773, 61 F.T.C. 326, 1962 FTC LEXIS 85, at *51-52 (July 31,1962) (holding that small print disclaimers that were inconsistent and contradictory to the content of the advertisements were ineffective to cure deceptive advertising), aff'd, Giant Food, Inc. v. FTC, 322 F.2d 977, 986 (D.C. Cir. 1963); FTC v. QT, Inc., F. on-screen statement in infomercial that \"'this product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent disease' [was] wholly inadequate to change the net impression of the pain relief claims made\"). Accordingly, the disclaimers in Respondents' advertisements in this case are not adequate to avoid liability. See FTC v. Phoenix Avatar, LLC, No. 04 C 2897, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14717 (N.D. lll. July 29,2004) (holding that disclaimer on the back of product packaging, that \"[t]hese statements have not beenevaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease,\" did not foreclose liability for deceptive advertising of weight-loss product). g. Extrinsic evidence is not required Respondents contend that their advertisements cannot be interpreted through a facial analysis alone, and that extrinsic evidence of consumer perceptions is required in order to find implied claims. RB at 5, 7,10. Bofuthe Commission and the courts, however, have squarely rejected the notion that extrinsic evidence is always necessary in order to prove an implied claim. As the Commission explained in Thompson Medical: [T]he Commission employs two different techniques in evaluating whether an advertisement contains implied claims. One is to look at evidence from the advertisement itself. We Qften conclude that an advertisement contains an implied claim by evaluating the conten[t] of the advertisement and the circumstances surrounding it. This technique is primarily useful in evaluating advertisements whose language or depictions are clear enough, though not express, for us to conclude with confidence after examining the interaction of all the different elements in them that they contain a particular implied claim. If our initial review of evidence from the advertisement itself does not allow us to conclude with confidence that it is reasonable to read an advertisement as containing a particular implied message, we will not find the ad to make the implied claim unless extrinsic evidence allows us to conclude that such a reading of the ad is reasonable. 104 F.T.C. at 789,1984 FTC LEXIS 6, at *312-13. 97 ill Kraft v. Federal Trade Commission, the court affirmed the Commission's holding that Kraft's advertising, which stated that Kraft uses \"five ounces of milk\" per slice of cheese, implied that its cheese had the same calcium content as that portion of milk. 970 F.2d at 313. ill finding that implied claim, the Commission relied on the advertising itself and did not rely on any extrinsic evidence of consumer perceptions of the advertising. On appeal, Kraft argued that the Commission should be required, as a matter of law, to support its findings with extrinsic evidence in all cases involving implied claims. The court, finding Kraft's argument \"unavailing as a matter of law,\" observed: Courts, including the Supreme Court, have uniformly rejected imposing such a requirement on the FTC, and we decline to do so as well. We hold that the Commission may rely on its own reasoned analysis to determine what claims, including implied ones, are conveyed in a challenged advertisement, so long as those claims are reasonably clear from the face of the advertisement. ... The implied claims Kraft made are reasonably clear from the face of the advertisements. . .. Hence the Commission was not required to utilize consumer surveys in reaching its decision. 970 F.2d at 319-20 (citing FTC v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 380 U.S. 374, 391-92 (1965) (stating that the FTC is not required to conduct consumer surveys before determining that a commercial has a tendency to mislead) (other citations omitted)). In this case, Respondents' advertising claims are even more clearly implied than those in Kraft. The interaction of product descriptions, advertisement headings, visual images, testimonial titles, and testimonial texts, among other elements, is more than sufficient to conclude with confidence that the advertisements at issue make the claims alleged in the Complaint. The implied claims in Respondents' advertising are beyond \"reasonably clear.\" They are clear and conspicuous from the advertismg itself. Accordingly, no extrinsic evidence is necessary to interpret the claims. See FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44145, at *42 n.12 (entering summary judgment in false advertising case where facial analysis of dietary supplement advertisements showed clearly implied claims of effectiveness for treatment of erectile dysfunction, holding that extrinsic evidence of consumer perceptions was unnecessary as a matter of law). See also FTC v. QT, Inc., 448 F. Supp. 2d at 958 (stating: '''The courts and the FTC have consistently recognized that implied claims fall along a continuum from those which are so conspicuous as to be virtually synonymous with express claims to those which are barely discernible. It is only at the latter end of the continuum that extrinsic evidence is necessary. ''') (quoting FTC v. Febre, No. 94 C 3625, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9487, at *14 (N.D. Ill. July 3, 1996)). Respondents contend that extrinsic evidence is particularly necessary in this case because the advertising was targeted at a particular group, defined by Respondents as individuals devoted to natural health in general and the constituents of Respondents' religious ministry in particular. RB at 6-7. While it is true that, if an advertisement is targeted at a particular group, the Commission analyzes the advertisements from the perspective of reasonable consumers within 98 that group, In re Telebrands, 140 FT.C. at 291, in this case there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Respondents' advertising was directed only at the target group Respondents allege. Rather, the evidence shows that anyone can access the advertisements. The DCa publication, \"The Most Simple Guide,\" is available on the DCO Website and anyone can download it. F. 163. The BioGuide and the Cancer Newsletter are also available on-line through the DCO Website. F. 169,172. Consumers can locate the DCa Website by entering the term \"cancer\" in a Google search. F. 162. Moreover, nothing on the DCa Website indicated to the FTC investigator who made the undercover purchase in this case that a consumer would have to be part of any religious community in order to purchase the Challenged Products. F. 149. Accordingly, it is not necessary to interpret Respondents' claims from the perspective of Respondents' purported target group and extrinsic evidence is not necessary for that purpose. 2. Respondents' claims are misleading There are two theories to prove that an advertisement is deceptive or misleading: (1) the \"falsity\" theory4 or (2) the FTC v. Pantron 1,33 F.3d at 1096; In re Thompson Medical, 104 F.T.C. at 818-19, 1984 FTC LEXIS 6, at *380-81. The Complaint in this case makes allegations only under the reasonable basis theory (Complaint <JrJ[ 15, 16) and thus the analysis in this decision consider~!4e reasonable basis theory only. The reasonable basis theory holds that claims about a product's attributes, performance, or efficacy (\"objective\" product claims5) carry with them the express or implied representation that the advertiser had a reasonable basis substantiating the claims at the time the claims were made. In re Thompson Medical, 104 F.T.C. at 813, 1984 FTC LEXIS 6, at *367; FTC v. Direct Marketing Concepts,~ 569 F. Supp. 2d at 298; In re Kroger, No. C-9102, 1978 FTC LEXIS 332, at *15 (May 17, 1978). Respondents' advertising claims, including claims that the Challenged Products are \"Cancer Treatments\" and \"Cancer Solutions,\" are objective product claims because the claims are stated in positive terms and are not qualified to be statements of opinion. See Koch v. FTC, 206 F.2d 311,318 (6th Cir. 1953). In addition, Respondents' testimonials constitute objective claims that the products inhibit tumors or are otherwise effective in the treatment of cancer. See id: Accordingly, Respondents implied that they had a reasonable basis to substantiate these claims. See In re Thompson, 104 FT.C. at 813, 1984 FTC LEXIS 6, at *367. See also Answer <J[ 15 (adinitting that Respondents relied upon a reasonable basis that substantiated the challenged representations). 4 Under the \"falsity\" theory, in order to prevail, the government must carry the burden of proving that the express or implied message conveyed by the ad is false. Pantron I v. FTC, 33 F.3d at 1096; In re Thompson Medical, 104 F.T.C. at 818-19, 1984 FTC LEXIS 6, at *379-80. 5 Claims regarding a product's attributes, performance, or efficacy are considered \"objective\" claims, as opposed to mere sales \"puffery,\" because such claims can be objectively verified. In re Thompson Medical, 104 F.T.C. at 788-89 n.6, 1984 FTC LEXIS 6, at *312 n.6. 99 In detennining whether an advertiser has satisfied the reasonable basis requirement, it must be detennined (1) what level of substantiation the advertiser is required to have for its advertising claims, and then (2) whether the advertiser possessed and relied on that level of substantiation. FTC v. Pantron 1,33 F.3d Inc., 448 F. Supp. 2d at 959. Respondents have the burden of establishing what substantiation they relied on for their product claims and Complaint Counsel has the burden of proving that Respondents' purported substantiation is inadequate. FTC v. QT, Inc., 448 F. Supp. 2d at 959. If an advertiser does not have a reasonable basis substantiating its claims, the representations are deceptive or misleading. FTC v. Pantron 1,33 F.3d at 1096; FTC v. 448 F. Supp. 2d at 959-60. As further discussed below, the appropriate level of substantiation for health-related efficacy claims, such as those made by Respondents here, is \"competent and reliable scientific evidence.\" Because Respondents did not possess or rely upon such evidence, Respondents' advertising claims are misleading. a. Competent and reliable scientific evidence is needed for health-related efficacy claims The level of substantiation required depends on whether the advertising claims at issue are (1) establishment claims or (2) non-establishment claims. Thompson Medical Co. v. FTC, 791 F.2d 189, 194 (D.C. Cir. 1986). Establishment claims are those that contain representations regarding the amount of support the advertiser has for its product claims. Id.; FTC v. Direct Marketing Concepts, 569 F. Supp. 2d at 298 (citing FTC Policy Statement on Advertising Substantiation, appended to In re Thqmpson Medical, 104 F.T.C. at 839,1984 FTC (hereinafter Advertising Substantiation\"\u00bb. ''They are in effect statements 'that scientific tests establish that a product works.'\" FTC v. Direct Marketing Concepts, 569 F. Supp. 2d at 298 (citing Removatron v. FTC, 884 F.2d at 1492 n.3). Common examples of establishment claims include such as ''tests prove,\" \"doctors recommend,\" or \"studies show.\" /d. at 298-99 (citing Policy on Advertising Substantiation; Thompson Medical Co. v. FTC, 791 F.2d at 194) (other citations omitted). Where the challenged advertisements contain establishment claims, the Commission expects the advertiser to have at least the amount and type of substantiation it claimed to have had. Thompson Medical Co. v. FTC, 791 F.2d at 194. See Removatron v. FTC, 884 F.2d at 1498 (holding that advertiser lacked reasonable basis for establishment claim as to product's hair removal effects, as a matter of law, because advertiser did not have any well-controlled scientific studies supporting the claim). By contrast, a non-establishment claim is simply a claim about a product's attributes, perfonnance, or efficacy, without indicating any particular level of support for such claim. In re Thompson Medical, 104 F.T.c. at 815, 1984 FTC LEXIS 6, at *370. For non-establishment claims, what constitutes sufficient substantiation may depend on multiple factors, such as the type of claim, the type of product, the consequences of a false claim, the benefits of a truthful claim, the cost of developing substantiation for the claim, and the amount of substantiation that experts in the field believe is reasonable. FTC v. Direct Marketing Concepts, 569 F. Supp. 2d at 299 (citing Removatron v. FTC, 884 F.2d at 1492 n.3); accord FTC v. QT, Inc., 448 F. Supp. 2d at 100 959 (citing Policy on Advertising Substantiation). In Thompson Medical, the Commission stated that determining the appropriate level of substantiation for non-establishment claims requires weighing the following factors: (1) the product involved; (2) the type of claim; (3) the benefits of a truthful claim; (4) the ease of developing substantiation for the claim; (5) the consequences of a false claim; and (6) the amount of substantiation experts in the field would agree is reasonable. 104 F.T.C. at 821, 1984 FTC LEX IS 6, at *387 (citing In re Pfizer, Inc. 81 F.T.C. 23 (1972), aff'd, 791 F.2d 189 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (hereinafter the \"Pfizer factors\"). The DCO advertising at issue represents that the Challenged Products, individually or COllectively, prevent, treat, or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, or ameliorate the adverse effects of chemotherapy or radiation. F. 189, 191, 193,202,211,222,224,227,229,230,232,234,235, 239,245,248,250,255,257,258,269,272,275,277-78,280-81,286,288,291,294. The advertisements do not represent that the claims have been proven by scientific testing, except in a very few cases. E.g., F. 225,231,247. Complaint Counsel has not alleged or argued that Respondents' advertisements constitute establishment claims. Accordingly, the claims at issue are deemed non-establishment claims, and will be evaluated as such. As discussed below, the challenged daims made by Respondents are health-related efficacy claims. It is well established that health-related efficacy claims, including those made about dietary supplements specifically, must be substantiated by \"competent and reliable scientific evidence.\" FTC v. Natural Solution, Inc., No. CV 06-6112-JFW, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60783, at *11-12 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 7, 2007) (requiring competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate claims that liguid botanical dietary supplement Knutric was a treatment to prevent and fight various forms of cancer); FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEX IS 44145, at *43-44 (requiring competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate claims that dietary supplements under the brand names Thermalean, Lipodrene, and/or Spontane\u00ad ES, were effective for weight loss and sexual enhancement); FTC v. Direct Marketing Concepts, 569 F. Supp. 2d at 300, 303 (requiring competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate claims that dietary supplements, Coral Calcium and Supreme Greens, were effective to prevent, treat, or cure cancer); see also FTC v. QT, Inc., 448 F. Supp. 2d at 961 (requiring competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate claims that the Q-Ray bracelet provided immediate, significant, or complete relief from various types of pain). The foregoing authorities concluded that competent and reliable scientific evidence was the appropriate level of substantiation for health-related efficacy claims without first considering each of the Pfizer factors. However, to the extent specific application of the Pfizer factors is necessary for health-related efficacy claims, such application yields the same result: Respondents must have possessed and relied upon competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate the health-related efficacy claims that they made. Each of the Pfizer factors is considered below. 101 (1) The type of product Products related to consumer health require a high level of substantiation, such as scientific tests. In re Removatron Int'l Corp., No. 9200, 111 F.T.C. 206, 1985 FTC LEXIS 21, at *212 n.20 (Nov. 4, 1988), aff'd, 884 F.2d 1489; In re Thompson Medical, 104 F.T.C. at 822, 1984 FTC LEXIS 6, at *388. Claims that the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, or ameliorate the adverse effects of radiation and chemotherapy relate to consumer health. F. 219, 236, 259, 282, 295. Accordingly, a high level of substantiation is required. (2) The type of claim Claims that are difficult or impossible for consumers to evaluate for themselves require a high level of substantiation, such as scientific tests. The \"placebo\" effect of consumer expectations when taking a purported remedy makes it difficult for consumers to verify product effectiveness for themselves. In re Removatron, 1985 FTC LEXIS 21, at *212 n.20; In re Thompson Medical, 104 F.T.C. at 822-23,1984 LEXIS 6, at 1090 n.1. In this case, for yxample; consumers cannot effectively determine for themselves the accuracy of the claim that BioShark inhibits tumors. Similarly, consumers reading \"Tracey's\" testimonial cannot evaluate whether the claimed \"complete remission\" of Tracey's cancer is due to her consumption of the Challenged Products or some other factor. Therefore, a high level of substantiation is required. Respondents maintain that the challenged advertising does not state that the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure disease or tumors, and that Respondents' \"express statements\" constitute \"structure/function\" claims. RPFF No. 27,36,42,43. Respondents state that the phrase \"structure or function,\" in the context of dietary supplements claims, refers to representations about a dietary supplement's effect on the structure or function of the body for maintenance of good health and nutrition. RB at 3-4 (citing the FTC's Guide, Dietary Supplements: An Advertising Guide for Industry, at 26 n.2). As discussed in Section III D 1, supra, the words used in an advertisement cannot be viewed in isolation, but must be viewed along with all the other elements of the advertisement to obtain the overall net impression. The evidence demonstrates that the overall net impression of Respondents' advertising is that the Challenged Products, individually or collectively, prevent, treat, or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, or ameliorate the adverse effects of chemotherapy or radiation. F. 189, 191, 193,202,211,222, 224,227,229,230,232,234,235,239,245,248,250,255,257,258,269,272,275,277-78, 280-81,286,288,291, 294. These are health-related claims. F. 219, 236, 259, 282, 295. Therefore, Respondents' argument that they should be held to a lower standard of substantiation because they made \"structure/function\" claims is without merit. See FTC v. QT, Inc., 448 F. Supp. 2d at 962 (\"Defendants would not be required to have a gold-standard study to substantiate the Q-Ray bracelet if they did not make such a strong, medical claim. The choice belonged to Defendants.\"). 102 (3) The benefits of a truthful claim and the ease of developing substantiation for the claim These two factors -the benefits of a truthful claim and the ease of developing substantiation for the claim -are typically considered together. The consideration of these factors seeks to ensure that thelevel of substantiation required is not likely to deter product development or prevent disclosure of potentially valuable information about product characteristics to consumers. In re Removatron, 1985 Ffe LEXIS 21, at *212 n.20; In re Thompson Medical, 104 F.T.C. at 823-24,1984 FfC LEXIS 6, at *391. The fact that cancer patients could benefit from truthful claims of effective treatments is obvious. Respondents contend that developing \"competent and reliable scientific evidence\" is too costly for dietary supplements, and that such products should be held to a lower standard. RPFF No. 27, 36,42,43. However, as noted above, courts have required competent and reliable scientific evidence for claims about dietary supplements when such products are advertised to treat diseases or medical conditions. E.g., FTC v. Natural Solution, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60783, at *11-12; FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44145, at *43-44; FTC v. Direct Marketing Concepts, 569 F. Supp. 2d at 300,303. Although Respondents deny they \"stated\" that the Challenged Products. prevent, treat, or cure cancer or tumors, the evidence shows that the advertising clearly conveyed these claims. F. 189, 191, 193,202,211,222,224, 227,229,230,232,234,235,239,245,248,250,255,257,258,269,272,275,277-78,280-81, 286,288,291,294. (4) The consequences of a false claim The consequences of a false claim weigh in favor of requiring a higher level of substantiation in this case. The evidence shows that foregoing a proven cancer treatment in favor of an ineffective treatment would be injurious to a patient's health. F. 355-56. In addition, side effects andlor inappropriate dosing of a dietary supplement can cause harmful interactions that interfere with cancer treatment. F. 357-61. Furthermore, the Challenged Products are costly. F. 126-27, 135-37, 139-40, 143-44. Spending money on an ineffective remedy causes economic injury. In re Schering Corp., No. 9232, 1991 FfC LEXIS 427, at *134 (Sept. 16, 1991); In re Removatron, 1985 FfC LEX IS 21, at *212 n.20. (5) The amount of substantiation experts in the field believe is reasonable Dr. Miller was the only witness in this case qualified as an expert in cancer research and cancer treatment. F.326. His opinions, which were thorough and well-reasoned, were that competent and reliable scientific evidence is required to demonstrate that a cancer treatment is effective; that competent and reliable scientific evidence means controlled clinical studies; that animal and in vitro studies are insufficient; and that testimonials have no scientific validity. F.343-53. Respondents contend that the relevant field is dietary supplements, and that in this regard, Drs. Duke and LaMont are more qualified than Dr. Miller. RB at 8-9. Where, as here, a 103 dietary supplement is claimed to have medical effects, however, it is appropriate to rely on the opinion of an expert in the medical field. See FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44145, at *78-79 (accepting opinion of an expert in the field of erectile dysfunction as to level of substantiation required for claims that a dietary supplement was an effective treatment). In any event, while Drs. Duke and LaMont each opined that there was a \"reasonable basis\" for the statements submitted to them for evaluation, neither witness even offered an opinion as to the amount or type of substantiation that is reasonable to support a claim that the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer. F. 338, 387-88, 395-98. Accordingly, neither witness disputed Miller's opinion that competent and reliable scientific evidence is the appropriate standard for substantiating cancer claims. See FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44145, at *78-79. Although LaMont would include studies of animals and cell culture lines in her definition of competent and reliable scientific evidence, she also included human clinical trials in her definition. F. 344. Accordingly, the expert testimony supports holding advertising claims, such as those made by Respondents, to the \"competent and reliable scientific evidence\" standard of substantiation. b. Respondents did not possess or rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate their advertising claims Respondents did not possess or rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate their claims that any of the Challenged Products is effective, either alone or in combination with other DCO product-s, in the prevention, treatment, or cure of cancer, in inhibiting tumor formation, or in ameliorating the adverse effects of radiation and chemotherapy, and in fact, no such evidence exists. F. 362-86. Claims that a dietary supplement treats a medical condition must be substantiated by clinical or scientific testing on the product itself; testing only component ingredients of the product is insufficient, unless the testing is on an exact duplicate of the product's combination of active ingredients. F. 367; see FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44145, at *79; FTC v. Natural Solution, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60783, at *14-15 n.6 (holding on summary judgment that reliance on articles on the Internet, including the Mayo Clinic, website did not constitute adequate substantiation of claims that dietary supplement prevented or treated cancer where articles only addressed potential effects of particular herbs and did not demonstrate that the formula actually prevents or treats cancer). In the instant case, the Challenged Products were not tested to determine if they had the claimed effects. F.308-14. Studies upon which Respondents relied evaluated isolated compounds that are present in certain of the Challenged Products and showed nonspecific immunostimulatory activities or suggested cancer preventive effects. F. 367. As in National Urological Group and Natural Solution, however, and as stated by Dr. Miller, testing only certain components of a Challenged Product does not substitute for an actual evaluation of each of the Challenged Products itself. For example, one cannot extrapolate from results of a published non-clinical study of curcumin that GDU can eliminate tumors. GDU itself, or each 104 active ingredient in GDU, must be subjected to the same experimental conditions as those to which the curcumin was subjected. F. 367. In addition, the materials relied upon by Respondents as substantiation consisted of author opinions and reviews of literature on the use of herbal medicines for a number of different diseases, including cancer. F.365. Mere compilations of citations, which do not contain independent analysi& or support for claims made in advertising, do not constitute substantiation. FTC v. Direct Marketing Concepts, 569 F. Supp. 2d at 300-01. Most of the studies referenced by Respondents are not peer-reviewed papers. F. 365. Respondents' substantiation materials did not include any controlled clinical trials. F. 365. Respondents' substantiation included non\u00ad clinical in vitro or animal studies, which serve only to demonstrate potential activity and safety. F. 345, 366. Such potential activity is not sufficient substantiation for claimed anti-cancer effects. See FTC v. Natural Solution, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60783, at *14-15 (holding that reliance on Internet articles which addressed potential effects of herbs in Knutric and stated that further research was required did not substantiate anti-cancer claims). Instead, competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate Respondents' claims requires controlled, clinical studies. F. 343-48. Finally, Respondents' testimonials' do not constitute valid scientific evidence because, among other reasons, it cannot be confirmed that the speakers had cancer, or that the speakers' reported responses were not due to other treatment modalities. See Koch v. FTC, 206 F.2d 311, 315-16 (6th Cir. 1953) (giving case histories no weight in verifying treatment claims, where the clinical data were based upon insufficient diagnosis or indicated use of conventional treatment along with the product). An individual's report that he or she \"felt better,\" standing alone, does not scientifically measure response to a particular product. F.351-53. For these and other reasons, cases consistently hold that testimonials do not constitute adequate substantiation for health-related efficacy claims in advertising. As Judge Easterbrook explained in Federal Trade Commission v. QT, Inc.: [A] person who promotes a product that contemporary technology does not understand must establish\u00b7that this \"magic\" actually works. Proof is what separates an effect new to science from a swindle .... [D]efendants have no proof of the Q-Ray Ionized Bracelet's efficacy. The \"tests\" on which they relied were bunk. . .. What remain are testimonials, which are not a form of proof because most testimonials represent a logical fallacy: post hoc ergo propter hoc. (A Rerson who experiences a reduction in pain after donning the bracelet may have enjoyed the same reduction without it. That's why the \"testimonial\" of someone who keeps elephants off the streets of a large city by snapping his fingers is the basis of a joke rather than proof of cause and effect.). 512 F.3d 858,862 (7th Cir. 2008). See also Simeon Mgmt. Corp. v. FTC, 579 F.2d 1137,1143- 44 (9th Cir. 1978) (stating that anecdotal evidence, such as testimonials by satisfied customers, does not constitute adequate and well-controlled investigation, and therefore does not support 105 claims that drug was effective for weight loss); In re Warner-Lamben Co., No. 8891, 12, at *213 (Dec. 9, 1975) (\"Since there may be a divergence between what the user thinks the product will do for him and what the product actually does (or does not do), evidence of consumer beliefs has little probative value for determining whether\" a product works in the manner claimed), aff'd, 562 F.2d 749 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Respondents argue that the literature upon which they relied constitutes \"reasonable\" support for their \"express statements\" which they contend are \"structure/function\" claims. RFF Nos. 26, 40; RCOL Nos. 18,19. As discussed in Section III E 1-5 supra, the overall net impression of the DCa advertising is that each of the Challenged Products, either alone or in combination with other DCa products, is effective in the prevention, treatment, or cure of cancer, in inhibiting tumor formation, or in ameliorating the adverse effects of radiation and chemotherapy. F. 189, 191, 193,202,211,222,224,227,229,230,232,234,235,239,245, 248,250,255,257,258,269,272,275,277-78,280-81, 286, 288, 291, 294. The fact that there may have been some basis to support the \"express\" words of product descriptions, taken out of context, is immaterial because Respondents had no competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate the overall net impression conveyed by their advertisements. See FTC v. Bronson Panners, 564 F. Supp. 2d at 133-34 (holding that expert report that included conclusions that Chinese Diet Tea \"could lead to weight reduction,\" \"can be a useful part of a weight reduction program,\" and \"can help reduce fat absorption,\" while supporting the generalized notion that the product could be a useful part of a weight reduction program, did not support advertising claims that the product will lead to rapid and substantial weight loss). It bears mentioning that Respondents' strategy throughout this case, despite clear and well-established law, has been to igngre each component of their advertising except the \"express\" words of their product descriptions, as though those statements stand alone. Following this strategy, Respondents did not seek, nor did any of their proffered experts offer, an opinion as to whether there was competent and reliable scientific evidence to support the claims that were alleged in the Complaint. F. 339-40, 387-89, 397,399-400,405,408-09,418,420-21,422,424- 25. Respondents' proffered experts were not asked to review, and none of them did review, any of the DCO advertising at issue. J:. 338, 387, 395-96,404,410,418,422. None of Respondents' proffered experts, with the possible exception of Roy, opined as to what level of substantiation is necessary or appropriate for claims that a dietary supplement prevents, treats, or cures cancer. F. 387-88, 397-98, 405-07, 418-19, 422-23. None of Respondents' proffered experts had any expertise in treating cancer, or in testing the efficacy of proposed cancer treatments. F. 330-37, 414-17. The result of Respondents' strategy is that none of Respondents' proffered experts offered any opinions on any material, contested issue in the case, and the opinions that Respondents' proffered experts did offer are entitled to little, if any, weight. c. Respondents' claims are deceptive or misleading Complaint Counsel can show that a representation is deceptive or misleading by showing that the advertiser lacked a reasonable basis for asserting that the message was true. FTC v. Pantron 1,33 F.3dat 1096; FTC v. 448 F. Supp. 106 2d at 959-60. Complaint Counsel has demonstrated that Respondents lacked a reasonable basis for their claims that the Challenged Products, individually or collectively, prevent, treat, or cure cancer or inhibit tumors, or ameliorate the adverse effects of chemotherapy and radiation. Accordingly, Complaint Counsel has demonstrated that Respondents' claims are deceptive or misleading. 3. Respondents' advertising claims are material \"A claim is considered material if it 'involves information that is important to consumers and, hence, likely to affect their choice of, or conduct regarding a product. '\" Kraft v. FTC, 970 F.2d at 322 (citations omitted). Health-related efficacy claims are consistently held to involve information that is important to consumers. FTC v. Direct Marketing Concepts, 569 F. Supp. 2d at 299-300; FTC v. QT, Inc., 448 2d at 966; accord FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44145, at *45-46. Furthermore, the Commission is entitled to presume materiality for claims involving health concerns. Kraft v. FTC, 970 F.2d at 323. Accord Novartis Corp. v. FTC, 223 F.3d 783, 786 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (noting that information has be~n presumed material where it \"concerns the purpose, safety, efficacy, or cost of the product or service\") (quoting FfC Policy Statement ~Q peceptio:Q, appended to In Clijfdale Assocs., 103 F.T.C. 110, 182, 1984 FfC LEXIS 71, *189 (Mar. 1984\u00bb; FTC v. QT, Inc., 448 F. Supp. 2d at 966. The presumption may be rebutted with extrinsic evidence indicating that the claims are not material. FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44145, at *81. Respondents' advertising claigls that the Challenged Products, individually or collectively, prevent, treat, or cure cancer or inhibit tumors, or ameliorate the adverse effects of chemotherapy and radiation unquestionably relate to health concerns. F. 219, 236, 259, 282, 295. Claims that relate to health concerns are material. FTC v. Direct Marketing Concepts, 569 F. Supp. 2d at 299-300 (holding that claims that dietary supplements could prevent or treat cancer and other diseases were health-related efficacy claims which were \"clearly material\"); FTC v. QT, Inc., 448 F. Supp. 2d ~t 966 (stating that claims that the Q-Ray bracelet provides immediate, significant, or complete relief from various types of pain were \"[ w Jithout question\" medical, health-related claims that were material to consumers); FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEX IS 44145, at *46 (applying presumption of materiality to claims that dietary supplements were effective to treat weight loss and sexual dysfunction). Therefore, Respondents' claims are clearly material. In addition, Respondents did not make any argument, or attempt to introduce any evidence, that their claims are not material to consumers. Accordingly, Respondents' claims are deemed material. 107 .' ,., Respondents'Defenses Respondents have raised numerous defenses. Some of these defenses have been addressed in other sections of this mitial Decision.6 Only a few of Respondents' remaining defenses merit discussion, and these are addressed below. Regardless of whether a defense is specifically addressed in this mitial Decision, each of Respondents' defenses has been fully considered, and rejected as being without sufficient basis in fact andlor law. 1. Claims regarding insufficient proof a. Proof of unfair trade practices under Section 5(n) of the Act Respondents argue that Complaint Counsel must prove that Respondents' acts or practices are not only deceptive, but also \"unfair,\" as defined under Section 5(n) of the FTC Act. That Section provides: (n) Definition of unfair acts or practices. The Commission shall have no authority under this section or section 18 [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 57a] to declare unlawful an act or practice on the grounds that such act or practice is unfair unless the act or practice causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition. m determining whether an act or practice is unfair, the Commission may consider established public PQlicies as evidence to be considered with all other evidence. Such public policy considerations may not serve as a primary basis for such determination. 15 U.S.c. \u00a7 45(n). Respondents' argument fa,ils. Respondents cite no authority for their contention that the evidence must show that deceptive trade practices are also unfair because of substantial consumer injury. Moreover, the law is contrary to Respondents' position. It is well established that proof of deception does not require proof of actual consumer injury. FTC v. Direct Marketing Concepts, 569 F. Supp. 2d at 297; In re Kraft, 1991 FTC LEXIS 38, at *38. This is because misrepresentations harm consumer choice, and in this regard, injure both consumers and competition. In re Novartis Corp., 1999 FTC LEXIS 63, at *26. Accordingly, the harm resulting from a deceptive practice renders such practice \"unfair\" as well. In re Southwest Sunsites, Inc., No. 9134, 105 F.T.C. 7, 1980 FTC LEXIS 86, at *338 n.81 (Jan. 15, 1985). Indeed, the provisions of Section 12(b) of the FTC Act recognize this principle, by providing that false advertising is, by definition, an \"unfair or deceptive\" act or practice within the meaning of 6 See, e.g\" Sections III B (jurisdiction); III D 1 (interpretation of advertisements); III D 1 f (disclaimers); III DIg (extrinsic evidence); III D 2 a (level of substantiation). 108 Section 5 of the FTC Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 52(b). Therefore, there is no legal or logical reason to require additional, independent proof of unfairness under Section 5(n), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(n). b. Proof of inadequate substantiation (1) Requirement of placebo-controlled, double-blind studies Respondents assert that placebo-controlled, double-blind studies are not required for adequate substantiation under the FTC Act. RB at 2-3 (citing FTC v. QT, Inc., 512 F.3d 858). Respondents correctly note that the court in Federal Trade Commission v. QT, Inc. stated: \"Nothing in the Federal Trade double-blind studies. . .. Placebo-controlled, double-blind testing not a legal requirement for consumer products.\" 512 F.3d at 861. However, Respondents ignore the fact that the appellate court affIrmed the district court's holdings that substantiation for health-related efficacy claims must be based on competent and reliable scientifIc evidence, and that the studies upon which defendants relied were inadequate under that standard. Id. at 862. Moreover, the appellate court held that its conclusion regarding double-blind, placebo-controlled studies was of no help to the defendants because, as the district court had found after exhaustive analysis of the defendants' studies, \"defendants hard] no proof' to support their advertising claims. Id. . In the instant case as well, the language in Federal Trade Commission v. QT, Inc. regarding placebo-controlled, double-blind studies does not help Respondents because, as discussed in Section III D 2 supra, Respondents did not possess or rely upon any adequate substantiation for their claims that tb~ Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer. Respondents had no studies whatsoever of the effects of the Challenged Products themselves. F. 308-14. Respondents' substantiation materials included studies on isolated compounds that are present in some of the Challenged Products, rather than studies of the exact combinations of constituent ingredients in the Challenged Products. F.367. Respondents' own proffered expert, Dr. LaMont, admitted that because the products have not been tested, the effectiveness of BioShark, 7 Herb Formula, GDU,.and BioMixx to prevent, treat, or cure cancer is not known. F.364. Most of the substantiation materials upon which Respondents relied were not peer\u00ad reviewed papers. F. 365. Respondents' substantiation materials did not include controlled clinical human trials. F.365. Respondents' substantiation materials included author opinions and reviews of literature on the use of herbal medicines. F. 365. Many of the studies cited in Respondents' reference materials were in vitro or animal studies. F. 366. Ultimately, like the defendants in QT, Inc., Respondents here relied on testimonials (F. 316), \"which are not a form of proof.\" 512 F.3d at 862. (2) Substantiation for \"structure-function\" claims under DSHEA Respondents further contend that a high level of substantiation, such as placebo\u00ad controlled, double-blind studies, is not required because, according to Respondents, Respondents 109 made \"structure-function\" claims under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, Pub. L. No. 103-417, 108 Stat. 4325 (DSHEA). RB at 3, 7-8. Respondents 21 U.S.c. \u00a7 343(r)(6)(A), which relaxes certain DSHEA misbranding rules for statements on labels that \"describe ... the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans.\" In this case, the evidence demonstrates that Respondents made health\u00ad related efficacy claims. See supra Section III D 1-2. Such claims would not be deemed \"structure-function\" claims under DSHEA, even according to the cases cited by Respondents. See Pearson v. Shalala, 164 F.3d 650, 652 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (stating that claims that consumption of antioxidant vitamins may reduce the risk of certain kinds of cancers, consumption of fiber may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, consumption of omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, and 8 mg of folic acid in a dietary supplement is more effective in reducing the risk of neural tube defects than a lower amount in foods in common form constitute \"health claims\" under FDA regulations); United States v. Lane Labs-USA, Inc., 324 F. Supp. 2d 547,568 (D.N.J. 2004) (holding that claims that shark cartilage products were an effective treatment for cancer and HIV/AIDS were not structure-function claims). In any event, this case does not present issues relating to labeling under DSHEA, but advertising and unfair acts or practices under the FTC Act. Complaint <Jr][ 7-14, 16; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 45(a), 52. (3) FTC Guidelines for Dietary Supplement Advertising Next, Respondents argue that Complaint Counsel ignored FTC guidelines regarding the advertising of dietary supplements. RB at 4,8 (citing the FTC's Guide, Dietary Supplements: An Advertising Guide for Industry, available http://www gov /bcp/edu/pubs/bll~~iness/adv /bus09.shtm the Guidelines state that: (1) the evaluation of substantiation for dietary supplement claims must be flexible to ensure consumers have access to information about emerging areas of science; (2) there is no requirement that dietary supplement claims be supported by a specific number of studies; and (3) research concerning the biological mechanism underlying the claimed action of a dietary supplement is acceptable substantiation for dietary supplement claims. RB at 4, 8. . Respondents misconstrue the Guidelines. The first statement from the Guidelines that Respondents contend was ignored introduces a discussion of the five factors relevant in evaluating substantiation, which are the same as the five Pfizer factors. See Guidelines at 8-9; In re Thompson Medical, 104 ET.C. 648, 821, 1984 FTC LEXIS 6, at *387. The Pfizer factors were considered and applied in this case. See supra Section III D 2 a. The second statement from the Guidelines, to which Respondents referred, is preceded by important qualifying statements, which Respondents ignore, including that \"the [amount and type of] evidence needed depends on the nature of the claim,\" that \"all competent and reliable scientific research\" should be considered, and that \"the quality of studies [is] more important than quantity.\" Guidelines at 10. The nature of Respondents' claims was thoroughly considered in determining the level of substantiation required. See supra Section III D 1-2 a. The quality of Respondents' substantiation was fully evaluated and determined to not constitute competent and reliable scientific evidence. See supra Section III D 2 b. Finally, regarding Respondents' third 110 \u00b7 ~:';.: -'. -- statement, the Guidelines simply do not state that \"research concerning the biological mechanism underlying the claimed action of a dietary supplement is acceptable substantiation for dietary supplement claims.\" The Guidelines state: \"When a clinical trial is not possible (e.g., in the case of a relationship between a nutrient and a condition that may take decades to develop), epidemiologic evidence may be an acceptable substitute for clinical data, especially when supported by other evidence, such as research explaining the biological mechanism underlying the claimed effect.\" Guidelines at 10 (emphasis added). To the extent Respondents' substantiation materials included any \"research explaining the biological mechanism\" of the Challenged Products, it was determined that such materials did not constitute adequate substantiation for the claim that the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer. See supra Section III D 2 b. 2. Due process claim Although Respondents' due process claim is difficult to discern, it appears to be based upon what Respondents contend is a lack of evidence. Respondents assert that: Under DSHEA, dietary supplements must be proved harmful; there is no evidence of unfairness or consumer injury; and extrinsic evidence is necessary to determine the overall net impression of their advertising. RB at 10-11. To find liability-without such evidence, according to Respondents, violates their procedural due process rights, under Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976) and Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972). Neither cited opinion has any bearing on this case legally or factually. Moreover, each alleged evidentiary deficiency has been proved erroneous. As noted in supra Sections III DIg and III E 1 a-b, DSHEA law does not govern this deceptive advertising case, consumer injury is got an element of proof in a deceptive advertising case, unfairness is not an element of proof in a deceptive advertising case, and extrinsic evidence is not necessary to determine the overall net impression of advertisements where, as here, the meaning is sufficiently clear on the face of the advertisements. Accordingly, Respondents' due process argument has no merit. 3. United States v. Johnson Respondents rely on the near-century-old case of United States v. Johnson, 221 U.S. 488 (1911) to argue that unsubstantiated claims regarding product effectiveness are not unlawful because such claims are matters of opinion, not fact. See, e.g., Respondents' Motion to Dismiss, Jan. 11,2009, at 6-8. Johnson involved the question of whether medicine bottles, whose labels contained false and misleading representations that the medicine was effective in curing cancer, were \"misbranded\" within the meaning of Section 8 of the Food and Drug Act of 1906. 221 U.S. at 495-97. The Court held that the Act was not intended to cover all possible false or misleading statements regarding medicine, but only those related to the identity of the contents of the medicine. ld. On its face, Johnson has no application to this case. In addition, Congress implicitly overruled Johnson by amending the Food and Drug Act to expressly include claims regarding curative effectiveness. Act of June 30, 1906, as amended, 37 Stat. 416 (1912). Finally, as noted in Section III D 2 supra, Respondents' advertising claims, including claims that the Challenged Products are \"Cancer Treatments\" and \"Cancer Solutions,\" are stated in positive 111 terms, and not qualified by opinion. See Koch v. FTC, 206 F.2d at 318 (holding that representations concerning the therapeutic value of certain medicinal preparations were within jurisdiction of FTC). Respondents' claims are representations of fact because they are subject to objective verification. See In re Thompson Medical, 104 F.T.C. 648, 788-89 n.6, 1984 FTC LEXIS 6, at *312 n.6 (stating that claims that can be objectively verified do not constitute mere \"puffery\"). Thus, Johnson does not support Respondents' position. 4. First Amendment defense Respondents assert that their statements about the Challenged Products reflect both their religious view of life grounded in the Christian Bible and their political beliefs concerning allopathic drugs and pharmaceutical companies. RB at 12-13. Thus, Respondents maintain, their statements about the Challenged Products constitute religious and political speech protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. RB at 12-13. Respondents further argue that even if their statements are found to be commercial speech, they are protected by the First Amendment. RB at 13. Respondents also assert that the FTC has the burden of showing that Respondents' statements are misleading and the burden of proving that suppression of those statements is necessary to achieve a substantial government interest. RB at 16. In addition; Respondents assert that the First Amendment doctrine of prior restraint would prohibit an FTC order enjoining Respondents' representations. RBat 14. Complaint Counsel asserts that Respondents' representations constitute commercial speech. CCB at 32. Complaint Counsel further states that the evidence demonstrates that the challenged advertisements and promotional materials, which are broadly disseminated on the Internet to draw consumers, contain~little or no religious commentary. CCB at 32-33. Complaint Counsel also contends that this commercial speech is deceptive and, therefore, not protected by the First Amendment. CCB at 34-35. In addition, Complaint Counsel maintains that the FTC's action does not constitute a prior restraint. CCB at 35. Supreme Court decisions \"have recognized 'the \"common-sense\" distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties of speech.'\" Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 64 (1983) (quoting Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass'n, 436 U.S. 447, 455-56 (1978\u00bb. Thus, the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution accords less protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally safeguarded forms of expression. Id. at 64-65 (citing Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Servo Comm'n of 557, 562-563 (1980); Virginia Pharm. Bd. V. 425 U.S. 748, 771-72 n.24 (1976\u00bb. \"[A]s a general matter, 'the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content. '\" /d. at 65 (quoting Police Dep't of Chicago V. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972\u00bb. Thus, with respect to noncommercial speech, the Supreme Court has \"sustained content-based restrictions only in the most extraordinary circumstances.\" /d. \"By contrast, regulation of commercial speech based on 112 \\ content is less problematic.\" Id. \"In light of the greater potential for deception or confusion in the context of certain advertising messages, content-based restrictions on commercial speech may be permissible.\" /d. (citing In re R. M. J., 455 US. 191,200 (1982); Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U.S. 1 (1979)). \"Because the degree of protection afforded by the First Amendment depends on whether the activity sought to be regulated constitutes commercial or noncommercial speech,\" id., a determination must first be made as to whether Respondents' challenged representations constitute commercial speech. Once it is determined that the language at issue is commercial speech, case law makes clear that misleading or deceptive commercial speech is not protected by the First Amendment. a. Respondents' statements constitute commercial speech The determination of whether speech is commercial speech \"rests heavily on 'the common sense distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction ... and other varieties of speech.'\" Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Council, 471 U.S. 626, 637-38 (1985) (citations omitted); In re R.I. Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 9206, 111 F.T.C. 539, 1988 FfC LEXIS 9, at *9 (Mar. 4, (\"The Supn~me Court has referred to the 'core notion' of commercial speech as speech which proposes a commercial transaction.\") (citations omitted). As a result, the determining factor is whether the speech at issue \"propose[ s] a commercial transaction.\" Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, 492 US. 469, 473-74 (1989). Whether the speaker has an esonomic motivation for the speech is germane to the issue of whether the speech is commercial. In re Primus, 436 U.S. 412, 438 n.32 (1978) (stating that the line between commercial and noncommercial speech is \"based in part on the motive of the speaker\"); Bolger, 463 U.S. at 66. Another consideration is whether the statements refer to specific products. Bolger, 463 US. at 66; In re R.I. Reynolds, 1988 FfC LEXIS 9, at *14 (\"[I]nformation about attributes of a product or service offered for sale, such as type, price, or quality, is also indicative of cOIDD;lercial speech.\") (citing Friedman v. Rogers, 440 US. 1, 11 (1979)). The Federal Trade Commission has specifically stated: \"[I]nformation about health effects associated with the use of a product can properly be classified as commercial speech.\" In re R.J. Reynolds, 1988 FfC LEXIS 9, at *14 (citing Bolger, 463 U.S. at 66-67; National Comm'n on Egg Nutrition v. FTC, 570 F.2d 157, 163 (7th Cir. 1977)). In this case, the evidence very clearly shows that Respondents' speech is economically motivated and proposes a commercial transaction by urging consumers to purchase specific products. Respondent James Feijo conceded at trial that the DCO Website constitutes advertising. F. 161. Moreover, the content of Respondents' advertising promotes specific products and their attributes, and urges consumers to purchase those products. For example, in the BioMolecular Nutrition Product Catalog, Respondents list and describe the Challenged Products and state, \"Call Toll FREE 1-800-504-5511 or shop online at www.danie1chapterone.com ... F.91. There is no mention of a DCO ministry in the BioMolecular Nutrition Product Catalog. F.93. In the exhibits attached to the Complaint, and 113 admitted into evidence, Respondents clearly propose commercial transactions. F. 179-80 (webpage from the DCO Website, entitled \"Cancer News,\" which contains a picture of 7 Herb Formula and states regarding the Challenged Products as a group: \"If you suffer from an~type of cancer, Daniel Chapter One suggests taking 7*Herb Formula, Bio*Shark, BioMixx ,GDU Caps TM.\" Immediately following this text is a prominent picture of bottles of B ioMixx, 7 Herb Formula, Bio*Shark, and GDU, and adjacent to that is a statement in bold type, \"Daniel Chapter One's Cancer solutions,\" and text that states: \"To Buy the products click here. How to fight cancer is your choice!\") (emphasis omitted); F. 220-21 (printout of the webpage for BioShark on the DCO Website, with a heading in bold type, \"Immune Boosters,\" a picture of bottles of BioShark, and a shopping cart icon with the instruction, \"BUY NOW!\") (emphasis omitted); F. 262-63 (webpage for GDU on the DCO Website, which begins with a heading in bold type, \"hnmune Boosters,\" depicts bottles of GDU, with text that includes \"[t]his formula also helps to relieve pain and heal inflammation,\" and provides a link to \"buy now.\"). Further, Respondents' representations convey information about the health effects that are purportedly associated with the use of their products. See supra Section III D 1-2. E.g., F. 180 (DCO Website stating: \"If you suffer from any type of cancer, Daniel Chapter One suggests taking [the Challenged Products]\"). In addition to evaluating the content of the speech, the Supreme Court has found that the means used to publish speech is relevant to how speech should be classified. In re R.i. Reynolds, 1988 FTC LEXIS 9, at *15. For example, the Court has recognized that commercial speech frequently takes the form of paid-for advertising. Id. (citing Bolger, 463 U.S. at 66; Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.S. 350, 363-64 (1977); Virginia State Board of Pharmacy, 425 U.S. at 761). Respondents operate the DCO Website, www.danielchapterone.com. and the websites www.dc1pages.com, www.dc1store.com, www.7herbformula.com, and www.gdu2000.com, through which they accept consumers' orders. F. 103-04. Respondents have spent money to have the DCO websites and written publications created and for cable advertising services. F.159-60. Given the foregoing, the religious or political views, upon which Respondents' advertising was assertedly based, do not convert Respondents' commercial speech to constitutionally protected religious or political speech. In Bolger, the Supreme Court found that mailings constituted \"commercial speech notwithstanding the fact that they contain discussions of important public issues such as venereal disease and family planning.\" Bolger, 463 U.S. at 67-68. \"We have made clear that advertising which 'links a product to a current public debate' is not thereby entitled to tht< constitutional protection afforded noncommercial speech.\" Id. at 68 (quoting Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 563 n.5). The Supreme Court further held: \"A company has the full panoply of protections available to its direct comments on public issues, so there is no reason for providing similar constitutional protection when such statements are made in the context of commercial transactions. Advertisers should not be permitted to immunize false or misleading product information from government regulation simply by including references to public issues.\" [d. See also Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 563 (stating that failing to honor distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech \"could invite dilution, simply by a leveling process, of the force of the [First] Amendment's guarantee with respect to the latter kind 114 of speech\") (quoting Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass 'n, 436 U.S. at 456). Thus, even though Respondents assert that their representations are based on their religious view of life grounded in the Christian Bible and positioned as a political argument against drugs and pharmaceutical companies, RB at 12-13, it is clear from the foregoing examples that Respondents' speech seeks to promote sales of the Challenged Products. Accordingly, Respondents' challenged representations constitute commercial speech. b. Misleading commercial speech may be prohibited For commercial speech to receive the protections of the First Amendment, \"it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.\" Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 566. As the Supreme Court has explained: The First Amendment's concern for commercial speech is based on the informational function of advertising. Consequently, there can be no constitutional objection to the suppression of commercial messages that do not accurately inform the public about lawful activity. The government may ban forms of communication more likely to deceive the public than to inform it, or commercial speech related to illegal activity. Id. at 563-64. It is well settled that \"[t]he States and the Federal Government are free to prevent the dissemination of commercial speech that is false, deceptive, or misleading.\" Zauderer, 471 U.S. at 638; In re R. M. J., 455 U.S. at 203 (noting that the government may prohibit false or misleading commercial advertising entirely). Restrictions on deceptive advertising of food and drugs have repeatedly been upheld against First Amendment~hallenges. Association of Nat'l Advertisers v. Lungren, 44 F.3d 726, 734 n.3 (9th Cir. 1994) (citing Kraft v. FTC, 970 F.2d at 324-26 (upholding FTC ban on deceptive claims about the calcium content of processed cheese products); Bristol-Myers Co. v. FTC, 738 F.2d 554, 562 (2d Cir. 1984) (upholding FTC prohibitions on certain types of advertising claims about analgesics\u00bb. See also FTC v. National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44145, at *29-30 (citing Bristol-Myers v. FTC, 738 562 (\"deceptive advertising enjoys no constitutional protection\"\u00bb. \"Even in the absence of a fmding of actual deception, agencies may properly regulate speech that is merely potentially deceptive.\" Bristol\u00ad Meyers v. FTC, 738 F.2d at 562 (citing Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U.S. 1, 15 (1979\u00bb. Respondents' representations have been found to lack adequate substantiation and therefore have been determined to be deceptive or misleading. See supra Section III D 2. Accordingly, the deceptive commercial speech at issue in this case is not protected by the First Amendment. c. Central Hudson does not apply Respondents argue that even if their statements are found to be commercial speech, they are protected by the First Amendment under Central Hudson. RB at 13, 16,22. In Central Hudson, the Supreme Court set out the standards applicable to governmental restrictions on 115 commercial speech: The State must assert a substantial interest to be achieved by restrictions on commercial speech; the regulatory technique must be in proportion to that interest; and the limitation on expression must be designed carefully to achieve the State's goal. Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 564. The Central Hudson test, however, is applied \"if the communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity.\" Id.; Grolier Inc. v. FTC, 699 F.2d 983, 988 (9th Cir. 1983). Where, as here, Respondents' practices are unlawful or misleading, First Amendment protections do not apply. Grolier v. FTC, 699 F.2d at 988; National Urological Group, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44145, at *30 (stating that Central Hudson test did not apply to the FfC deceptive advertising case before the court). Therefore, the Central Hudson test does not apply to this deceptive advertising case. d. Other cases relied upon by Respondents do not apply Respondents cite numerous First Amendment commercial speech cases involving advertisements for accountants and attorneys to show how the Supreme Court \"restated its Central Hudson test.\" RB at 16-18. Respondents' reliance upon these cases is misplaced. The accountant and attorney advertisement cases that Respondents cite all involve commercial . speech that was not misleading or that did not involve unlawful activity. See Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618, 620-24 (1995) (holding that the Florida Bar Rules prohibiting personal injury lawyers from sending targeted direct-mail solicitations to victims and their relatives for thirty days following an accident or disaster did not violate the First Amendment); Ibanez v. Fla. Dep't of Bus. and Pro!'l Regulation Bd. of Accountancy, 512 U.S. 136, 139, 142 (1994) (concluding that the Board's decision censoring petitioner was incompatible with the First Amendment, but recognizing that \"f~Jse, deceptive, or misleading commercial speech may be banned\"); Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 765-66 (1993) (holding that Florida's rule prohibiting certified public accountants from engaging in \"direct, in-person, uninvited solicitation\" is inconsistent with the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment when the speech involved is truthful and nondeceptive); Peel v. Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Comm'n of Ill., 496 U.S. 91, 100, 110-11 (1990) (stating that an attorney's letterhead was not actually or inherently misleading\" because a lawyer has a constitutional right, under the standards applicable to commercial speech, to advertise his or her certification, but stating that \"[m]isleading advertising may be prohibited entirely\"); In re R. M. J., 455 U.S. at 206-07 (stating that there is \"no finding that appellant's speech was misleading\" but noting that \"the States retain the authority to regulate advertising that is inherently misleading or that has proved to be misleading in practice\"). In the instant case, Respondents' challenged speech is misleading and unlawful. Accordingly, the commercial speech cases upon which Respondents rely are inapposite. e. The FTC's action does not constitute a prior restraint Respondents have asserted that this administrative proceeding and the issuance of a cease and desist order impose a prior restraint, in violation of their First Amendment rights, because there has been no proof that any consumer was actually misled or \"physically harmed.\" RRB at 13-15. Respondents restraint' is used 116 ;: 'to describe administrative and judicial orders forbidding certain communications when issued in advance of the time that such communications are to occur. ,,, Alexander v. United States, 509 U.S. 544, 550 (1993) (citations omitted). Courts have consistently held that a FTC cease and desist order prohibiting representations about performance of products without substantiation is not an unconstitutional \"prior restraint,\" but a reasonable sanction, imposed after a hearing establishes a violation of the FTC Act. E.g., Jay Norris, Inc. v. FTC, 598 F.2d 1244, 1252 (2d Cir. 1979) (\"[B]ecause the FTC here imposes the requirement of prior substantiation as a reasonable remedy for past violations of the Act, there is no unconstitutional prior restraint of petitioners' protected speech.\"); Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. FTC, 676 F.2d 385, 399 (9th Cir. 1982) (\"[T]he Commission may require prior reasonable substantiation of product performance claims after fmding violations of the Act, without offending the [F]irst [A]mendment.\"). Thus, the cease and desist order entered here, only after an administrative trial where the evidence conclusively showed that Respondents' advertising was misleading, does not constitute a prior restraint. The defenses advanced by Respondents are without merit. Accordingly, they do not provide a basis for holding that Respondents are not liable for the proven violations of the FTC Act. F. Summary of Liability The Complaint charges that the acts and practices of Respondents, as alleged in the Complaint, constitute deceptive advertising in violation of Sections 5(a) and 12 of the FTC Act. Complaint Counsel has presented reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in support of the Complaint's charges. The defenses-rilised by Respondents have been considered and rejected. Accordingly, Respondents DCO and James Feijo are hereby found liable for violating Sections 5(a) and 12 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 45(a), 52. G. Remedy On determination that a challenged act or practice is prohibited by Section 5 of the FTC Act, the appropriate remedy is an order requiring respondents to cease and desist from such act or practice. 15 U.S.c. \u00a7 45(b); FTC v. National Lead Co., 352 U.S. 419, 428 (1957). Courts have long recognized that the Commission has considerable discretion in fashioning an appropriate remedial order, subject to the constraint that the order must bear a reasonable relationship to the unlawful acts or practices. See, e.g., FTC v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 380 U.S. at 394-95; FTC v. Ruberoid Co., 343 U.S. 470, 473 (1952); Jacob Siegel Co. v. FTC, 327 U.S. 608,612-13 (1946). As held above, DCO is liable for the violations of the FTC Act alleged in the Complaint. Further, as set forth below, James Feijo is individually liable and an Order against him, as well as DCO, is appropriate. The Order attached herewith is reasonably related to the proven violations. 117 1. Individual liability When both a corporation and an individual are named in the complaint, to obtain a cease and desist order against the individual, Complaint Counsel must prove violations of the FTC Act by the corporation and that the individual either directly participated in the acts at issue or had authority to control them. FTC v. Amy Travel Serv., Inc., 875 F.2d at 573; see also FTC v. Standard Educ. Soc'y, 302 U.S. 112, 119-20 (1937) (finding it proper for Commission to include individuals who were in charge and control of the affairs of respondent corporations in the Commission's cease and desist order). As summarized in Section III F, DCO violated the FfC Act. As summarized in Section III B 6, Respondent James Feijo both participated directly in and had the authority to control and, in fact, did direct and control the deceptive representations at issue. Accordingly, James Feijo is individually liable for acts or practices of Respondent DCO that violate Sections 5 and 12 of the FTC Act, and the entry of a cease and desist order against James Feijo is appropriate. 2. Specific provisions of the Order The Order attached to this Initial Decision is substantially the same as the proposed order that accompanied the Complaint in this matter. The only substantive change in this Order from . the proposed order attached to the Comphiilli: is to the language in the letter, appended as Attachment A to the Order, that Respondents are required by this Order to send to consumers of the Challenged Products. That change is discussed below. As a result of the Findings and Conclusions in this case, the Order prohibits Respondents from making the types of misrepresentations challenged in the Complaint. The Order also provides fencing-in relief, requiring Respondents to possess competent and reliable scientific evidence supporting certain future claims about any dietary supplement, food, drug, or other health-related product, service, or program. These provisions are discussed below. In addition, the Order contains standard provisions regarding record-keeping, dissemination of the order to officers and employees, prior notification of corporate changes, filing compliance reports, and sunsetting of the Order. a. Competent and reliable scientific evidence requirement The Order prohibits Respondents from making representations that any health-related program, service, or product prevents, treats, or cures, or assists in the prevention, treatment, or cure of any type of tumor-or cancer, unless the representation is true, non-misleading, and, at the time it is made, Respondents possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates the representation. \"Competent and reliable scientific evidence\" is defined in the Order to mean \"tests, analyses, research, studies, or other evidence based on the expertise of professionals in the relevant area, that has been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results.\" 118 Commission orders requiring respondents to have competent and reliable scientific evidenGe, as defined in this Order, that is based on the expertise of professionals in the area and that has been conducted and evaluated by persons qualified to do so, are typical and have been consistently upheld. E.g., In re Telebrands, 140 F.T.C. at 347, a!f'd, 457 F.3d 354; In re Kraft, 114 F.T.C. at 149, a!f'd, 970 F.2d 311 (7th Cir. 1992). See also In re Thompson Medical, 104 F.T.C. at 844, a!f'd, 791 F.2d at 192 (upholding order requiring respondents to possess and rely upon a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable scientific or medical evidence to substantiate certain representations, and defining '''competent and reliable scientific evidence' [to] include at least two adequate and well-controlled, double-blinded clinical studies ... by persons ... qualified by training and experience to conduct such studies\"); In re Removatron, 1985 FTC LEXIS 21, at *167, a!f'd, 884 F.2d at 1498 (upholding order requiring respondents to possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate representations and defining \"'competent and reliable scientific evidence' ... as adequate and well-controlled, double-blind clinical testing conforming to acceptable designs and protocols and conducted by a person or persons qualified by training and experience to conduct such testing\"). b. Fencing-in provision The Order entered herewith prohibits. Respondents from making certain representations not only as to the Challenged Products, but also as to any substantially similar health-related program, service, or product, or any other Covered Product or Service. \"Covered Product or Service\" is defmed in the Order to mean any dietary supplement, food, drug, or other health\u00ad related product, service, or program, including, but not limited to, BioShark, 7 Herb Formula, GDU, and BioMixx. Thus, the Order, by prohibiting Respondents from engaging in deceptive practices concerning products in addition to the Challenged Products, provides \"fencing-in\" relief. \"Fencing-in\" relief refers to provisions in an FTC order that are broader than the conduct that is declared unlawful and may extend to multiple products. Telebrands Corp. v. FTC, 457 F.2d 354, 357 n.5 (4th Cir. 2006) (citing In re Telebrands, 140 F.T.C. at 281 n.3); American Home Prods. v. FTC, 695 F.2d at 705; Kraft v. FTC, 970 F.2d at 326 (citing FTC v. Colgate\u00ad Palmolive, 380 U.S. at 395; Sears v. FTC, 676 F.2d at 391-92). \"Fencing-in remedies are designed to prevent future unlawful conduct.\" Telebrands, 457 F.2d at 357 n.5 (citing In re Telebrands, 140 F.T.C. at 281 n.3). \"Such an order must be sufficiently clear that it is comprehensible to the violator, and must be 'reasonably related' to a violation of the Act.\" Kraft, 970 F.2d at 326 (citation omitted). In determining whether a broad fencing-in order bears a \"reasonable relationship\" to a violation of the FTC Act, Courts and the Commission consider: (1) the deliberateness and seriousness of the violation; (2) the degree of transferability of the violation to other products; and, (3) any history of prior violations. Telebrands, 457 F.2d at 358; Kraft, 970 F.2d at 326. Applying these factors to the facts of this case, in order to provide adequate consumer protection, the fencing-in relief in this Order is appropriate. 119 (1) Deliberateness and seriousness of the violation In weighing the deliberateness of the violation, the evidence shows that Respondents made numerous deceptive representations over the Internet, in their publications, and through the DCO radio program, over the course of several years. Respondents were aware that they were making representations that could be deemed unlawful by governing authorities. See F. 215 (DCO HealthWatch radio program, where James Feijo stated that \"the \u00a5fC, the FDA, the Canadian Government don't like the fact that we've told people about what to do about natural methods of health and healing, especially cancer\"); F. 217 (DCO HealthWatch radio program, in which Patricia Feijo advised an individual whose father was diagnosed with colon cancer that she should get her father \"on ... GDU, BioShark and 7 Herb Formula. And if you can get him to, you know, go right now to the website, [to download] How To Fight Cancer Is Your Choice, or you can get him a hard copy from our order center, while we have them. It's what the PrC wants to shut us down over and they certainly want us to, you know, crash the website and they want to, you know, bum our material.\"). In weighing the seriousness of the violation, the evidence shows that the representations are health-related claims, see supra III D 1-2, and in some instances suggested that individuals forego traditional cancer treatments in favor-of purchasing and consuming the Challenged Products. E.g., F. 260 (During the July 8, 2008 DCO HealthWatch radio program, in response to a caller's concern about colon cancer and whether the caller should follow her doctor's recommendation of a colonoscopy, James Feijo stated, \"Polyps are nothing ... Polyps should be left alone.\"); F. 214 (2008 DCO HealthWatch radio program, in which James Feijo stated, \"Here's a testimony from Pastor Wayne Hamm, Henderson, Nevada. He had the Gulf War illness. He was told that he needed surgery and radiation treatment for his cancer, that he developed skin cancer because of the Gulf War, he was exposed out there. He didn't take it. He decided to use Daniel Chapter One 7 Herb Formula, internally and topically. He also used Ezekiel Oil topically, BioShark and GDU. [His] skin cleared up after a few months in the late 1980s [sic], early '99, [he] was told there was no trace of cancer.\"). There is a potential harm if a cancer patient foregoes potentil:;tlly beneficial therapy and replaces it with one or more of the Challenged Products. F. 356. In addition, taking the Challenged Products could cause a dangerous interaction with drugs. F. 357. \"When drug advertising is at issue, the potential health hazards may well justify a more sweeping order than would be proper were the Commission dealing with a less consequential area.\" American Home Prods. v. FTC, 695 F.2d at 706. Here, where Respondents intentionally represented that the Challenged Products could prevent, treat, or cure cancer, through numerous publications and websites, the deliberateness and seriousness of the violation weighs heavily in favor of the Order encompassing a broad range of products. (2) Degree of transferability A violation is transferrable where other products could be sold utilizing similar techniques. FTC v. Colgate-Palmolive, 380 U.S. at 394-95; Sears v. FTC, 676 F.2d at 392. For example, \"misrepresenting that doctors prefer a product, or that tests prove the product's 120 superiority, is a fonn of deception that could readily be employed for any non-prescription drug product.\" American Home Prods. Corp. v. FTC, 695 F.2d at 708. In this case, the claims that the Challenged Products prevent, treat, or cure cancer, and the use of testimonials by doctors and consumers to make such claims, could readily be employed for any dietary supplement. Thus, transferability is a significant factor in favor of provisions in the Order encompassing a broad range of products. (3) History of violations No evidence was introduced or argument made to indicate that Respondents have a history of prior violations of the FfC Act. However, \"the more egregious the facts with respect to a particular element, the less important it is that another negative factor be present. In the fmal analysis, [courts] look to the circumstances as a whole and not to the presence or absence of any single factor.\" Sears v. FTC, 676 F.2d at 392; see also Kraft v. FTC, 970 F.2d at 327. In Telebrands, the Court of Appeals upheld the Commission's conclusion that the strength of the evidence as to the first two factors sufficiently established that there was a reasonable relationship between the remedy and the violation, and it was not necessary to also consider any prior consent orders. Telebrands, 457 F.2d at 362. Thus, while here there is no history of violations which would weigh against the -Order encompassing a broad range of products, that factor is less important, taking into account the circumstances as a whole. Accordingly, weighing all of the factors, the fencing-in relief in the attached Order bears a reasonable relationship to Respondents' violations of the FfC Act. c. ReqQirement of a letter to consumers The proposed order requires Respondents to mail a letter to each consumer of the Challenged Products, to ihfonn him or her that the FfC has found that Respondents' advertising claims for these products were false and unsubstantiated and that the FfC has issued an Order prohibiting Respondents from making those claims in the future. It is appropriate to require Responden,ts to mail a letter to consumers to infonn them of those findings. E.g., FTC v. Natural Solution, Inc., No. CV 06-06112-JFW (CD. Cal. Sept. 4, 2007). However, the proposed letter attached to the Complaint will be modified in two respects. First, the proposed letter attached to the Complaint could be seen as requiring Respondents to adopt as their own statements and opinions that are contrary to the beliefs to which Respondents testified at trial. Therefore, the letter is modified to make it clear that the infonnation contained in the letter is iirfonnation that the FfC has required Respondents to transmit to consumers. Second, the letter is modified to reflect the fact that consumers purchased the Challenged Products not only through the DCO websites, but also through the toll-free number to DCO's call center. 121 d. Summary of remedy The Order entered herewith is sufficiently clear and precise and is reasonably related to the unlawful acts or practices found to exist. IV. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1. Complaint Counsel bears the burden of proving jurisdiction and liability by a preponderance of evidence. 2. Respondent Daniel Chapter One (\"DCa\") engages in business for its own profit or that of its sole member, Respondent James Feijo. 3. Respondent Daniel Chapter One (\"DCa\") is a corporation, as \"corporation\" within the meaning of \"corporation\" in Section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. 4. Respondent James Feijo directed and controlled the acts and practices of DCO and may be held liable under the FTC Act for the violations of DCO. 5. Respondents' sales of BioShark, 7 Herb Formula, GDU, and BioMixx, the \"Challenged Products,\" are in or affect commerce, as required by the FfC Act, 15 U.S.c. \u00a7 45(a)(1). . 6. The Commission has jurisdiction over Respondents, and the conduct challenged in the Complaint, under Sections 4 and 5 of the FfC Act. 15 U.S.c. \u00a7 44,45. 7. The materials disseminated by Respondents over the Internet constitute advertisements under Section 12 of the Fl'C Act. 15 U.S.c. \u00a7 52. 8. The materials disseminated by Respondents over the Internet were for the purpose of inducing and did induce purchases of the Challenged Products in or affecting commerce, under Section 12 of the FfC Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 52, 55. 9. The Challenged Products constitute \"food\" or \"drugs,\" under Section 12 of the FfC Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 55. 10. The overall, net impression created by the Respondents' advertisements is that the Challenged Products, either alone or in combination with each other or other DCO products, prevent, treat, or cure cancer, inhibit tumors, or ameliorate the adverse effects of radiation or chemotherapy. 11. The disclaimer language, which appears on some of the advertisements, is not 122 .... ' .. '.\"r prominent or unambiguous, creates confusion with contradictory messages, and thus is not adequate for Respondents to avoid liability. 12. Extrinsic evidence is not required to interpret Respondents' advertisements or to interpret the claims from the perspective of a particular targeted group. 13. Extrinsic evidence is not required to interpret Respondents' advertisements because the meaning of the advertisements is reasonably clear from a facial review. 14. The claims made by Respondents are objective claims that relate to the attributes, performance, or efficacy of the Challenged Products. 15. Objective product claims carry with them the express or implied representation that Respondents had a reasonable basis substantiating the claims at the time the claims were made. 16. The claims made by Respondents are non-establishment claims and relate to health\u00b7 and safety. 17. Health-related efficacy claims, including claims made about dietary supplements must be substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence on the product itself. Testing only component ingredients is insufficient, unless the testing is on an exact duplicate of the product's combination of active ingredients. 18. Respondents did not possess or rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate their claims that the Challenged Products are effective, either alone or in combination with each other or other DCa products, in the prevention, treatment, or cure of cancer, tumors, or side effects of radiation or chemotherapy. 19. By showing that Respondents lacked a reasonable basis for their claims, Complaint Counsel has demonstrated that Respondents' statements are deceptive or misleading. 20. Respondents' claims relate to health concerns, involve information that is important to consumers and likely to affect their choice of or conduct regarding the Challenged Products, and are therefore material. 21. Respondents' representations constitute commercial speech that is false, deceptive, or misleading, and are therefore not protected by the First Amendment. 22. The FTC's action and the Order entered herewith do not constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint. 23. All defenses raised by Respondents have been considered and rejected as lacking in merit, regardless of whether they are expressly addressed in this Initial Decision. 123 24. Respondents DCO and James Feijo are liable for violating Sections 5(a) and 12 of the FTC Act. 15 U.S.c. \u00a7\u00a7 45(a), 52. 25. Individual Respondent James Feijo participated directly in and had the authority to control the deceptive representations at issue in this case. Accordingly, James Feijo is individually liable for practices of Respondent DCO found to be in violation of Sections 5 and 12 of the FTC Act. 26. The appropriate remedy is an order requiring Respondents to cease and desist from making the types of misrepresentations challenged in the Complaint. 27. Fencing-in relief is appropriate where, after examining circumstances of the case as a whole, it bears a reasonable relationship to a violation of the FTC Act. 28. The Order also provides fencing-in relief, requiring Respondents to possess competent and reliable scientific evidence supporting certain future claims about any dietary supplement, food, drug, or other health-related product, service, or program. 29. The Order attached herewith is clear and reasonably related to the proven violations. 124 ORDER For purposes of this order the following definitions apply: 1. \"Competent and reliable scientific evidence\" shall mean tests, analyses, research, studies, or other evidence based on the expertise of professionals in the relevant area, that has been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results. 2. \"Covered Product or Service\" shall mean any dietary supplement, food, drug, or other health-related product, service, or program, including, but not limited to, BioShark, 7 Herb Formula, GDU, and BioMixx. 3. \"Food\" and \"drug\" shall mean \"food\" and \"drug\" as defined in Section 15 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (\"FTC Act\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 55. 4. \"Advertisement\" means any written or verbal statement, illustration, or depiction that is designed to effect a sale or to create interest in the purchasing of goods or services, whether it appears in a book, brochure, newspaper, magazine, pamphlet, leaflet, circular, mailer, book insert, letter, catalogue, poster, chart, billboard, public transit card, point of purchase display, packaging, package insert, label, film, slide, radio, television or cable television, video news release, audio program transmitted dver a telephone system, infomercial, the Internet, e-mail, or in any other medium. 5.

ORDERED: Chief Administrative Law Judge Date: August 5, 2009 129 ATTACHMENT A LETTER TO BE SENT BY FIRST CLASS MAIL [To be printed on letterhead of Daniel Chapter One] [Name and address of recipient] [Date] Dear [Recipient]: Our records show that you bought [name of products] from our website [name of website] or through our call center using our toll free number. We are writing to tell you that the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") has found that our advertising claims for these products were false or unsubstantiated, and has issued an Order prohibiting us from making those claims in the future. The Order entered against us by the FTC also requires that we send you the following information about the scientific evidence on these products: Very little scientific research has been done concerning shark cartilage, cat's claw, burdock root, Siberian ginseng, and ginseng as a means of prevention, treatment, or cure for cancer in humans. The scientific studies that have been done do not demonstrate that any of these ingredients, which are iricluded in BioShark, 7 Herb Formula, GDU, and BioMixx, are effective when used for prevention or treatment for cancer in humans. It is very important that you talk to your doctor or health care provider before using any alternative or herbal product, including shark cartilage, cat's claw, burdock root, Siberian ginseng, and ginseng. Speaking with your doctor is important to make sure that all aspects of your medical treatment work together. Things that seem safe, such as certain foods, herbs, or pills, may interfere or affect your cancer or other medical treatment, or other medicines you might be taking. Some herbs or other complementary or alternative treatments may keep your medicines from doing what they are supposed to do, or could be harmful when taken with other medicines or in high doses. It also is very important that you talk to your doctor or health care provider before you decide to take any alternative or herbal product, including shark cartilage, cat's claw, burdock root, Siberian ginseng, and ginseng, instead of taking conventional cancer treatments that have been scientifically proven to be safe and effective in humans. 130 Sincerely, ,\".\", \". -'.-. --\" .. If you would like further information about complementary and alternative treatments for cancer, the following Internet web sites may be helpful: 1. The National Cancer Institute: www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq; or 2. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicines: www.nccam.nih.gov.
