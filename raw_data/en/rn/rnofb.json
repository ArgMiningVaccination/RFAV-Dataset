Our clinicians are well prepared to accurately screen for risk of COVID-19, respond effectively to prevent further spread, and offer the most appropriate and up-to-date treatments. We follow the guidance of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) so patients affected by COVID-19 can receive the care they need while protecting the health and safety of our providers, associates and the community at large. Visitor policies and guidance [Click here to read MedStar Health's current visitor policy.](/services/visitor-policies-during-covid19) What is the face mask policy for patients and visitors? Given reduced regional COVID-19 transmission levels, MedStar Health, in alignment with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Departments of Health, moved to the following face mask optional guidance across all MedStar Health locations, effective April 10, 2023: - Face masks (N95 respirators or procedure masks) are optional for all asymptomatic associates, patients, and visitors, including those in clinical areas. - Anyone with symptoms (including patients and visitors) must continue to mask in our facilities. - Providers may still order masking in a patient's room, especially for those patients at higher risk of infection. - Patients may request that providers and associates wear a face mask in their room or treatment area. - Face masks will be available onsite for patients, visitors, and associates. Our brand promise, It's how we treat people, reflects our commitment to treat our patients, visitors, and associates with respect and dignity. Our masking guidelines are subject to change based on transmission levels of infectious diseases and/or direction from the CDC or Departments of Health. About COVID-19 Is COVID-19 still a concern? Thanks to vaccination, testing, treatments, and prevention measures, hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID are low. However, the virus is still active because of community spread and the development of new variants. Most people recover from this infection, after only mild or moderate symptoms. However, some COVID-19 infections can lead to long COVID, serious illness, and in some cases death. If someone develops a more serious illness from COVID-19, they may be admitted to the hospital. Older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions have a greater risk for serious illness. Examples of pre-existing conditions are: cancer, diabetes, heart disease, underlying lung disease, or other conditions impacting the ability of the body's immune system to fight germs. Prevention The first and best step you can take to prevent getting sick or spreading COVID-19 is to [get vaccinated](#vaccines). In addition, everyday preventive steps that are always recommended to slow the spread of respiratory illnesses, like colds and flu: If you do have symptoms, [get tested](#testing) as soon as possible and isolate at home for at least 5 days if your results are positive. Discuss the details of isolation (how long to isolate, how long to wear a mask around others, etc.) with your healthcare provider. You can also refer to the [CDC's isolation and symptom tracker](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html). Vaccines and boosters COVID-19 vaccinations are FDA-approved for anyone 6 months of age and older.

PCR testing has been used since the pandemic began and is considered to be the \"gold standard\" by the CDC. Testing Frequently Asked Questions - When should I do a COVID-19 home test? COVID-19 home tests (or self-tests) are available over the counter or online for use without the order of a medical provider. These convenient tests can be used to rapidly determine whether you have COVID-19 and should self-isolate prior to gathering indoors (especially with those who are unvaccinated or immunocompromised) or after exposure or developing COVID-19 symptoms. Make sure to purchase a home test that is currently authorized for use by the FDA and always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions when testing. Do not use if the test is past the expiration date. Note: The FDA has extended the expiration dates for some test kits. You can visit the [FDA's website](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests)to verify the expiration date of your home kit. If you test positive, isolate immediately and inform your school, employer, and any close contacts. Stay home for at least 5 days from onset of symptoms and get in touch with your healthcare provider to help determine when your isolation period can end. Please report your positive test to your local department of health. Most home tests have information on how to do this. If you test negative, you may still have COVID-19, especially if you did not have any symptoms at the time of the test. Testing again within 24 hours increases the sensitivity of the test for those without symptoms but can still provide false-negative results. If you are worried that you might have COVID-19 or have ongoing symptoms despite a negative test result, contact your health care provider right away to discuss next steps. - What should I do if I test positive for COVID-19? Current recommendations for those who test positive are to complete a period of self- isolation to avoid spreading the infection to others. Contact a healthcare provider to review your symptoms and determine how long your period of self-isolation should last and whether treatment is indicated. This will vary based on your symptoms and whether you are living with others who also tested positive. - I (or my loved one) have COVID-19. When should we return to work/school/day care? Individuals should not return to work, school, or daycare until their isolation period has ended. Typically, this is no sooner than 5 days following a positive COVID-19 test or onset of symptoms. Certain individuals, such as those who work in health care, may be able to return to work sooner if they test positive but do not have symptoms. Consult with your local health department, employer, school, or day care center, as guidance may vary based on employer, school district, or local rules and regulations. - Do I need to be retested after testing positive? The CDC does not currently recommend repeating a test after testing positive. Under certain conditions, for instance testing positive with a rapid test when you do not have any symptoms, a follow-up swab may be sent out to the lab to confirm the results. However, you may end your recommended isolation without repeating a swab following a positive result. You may need a repeat test if required by school, your employer, or local rules or regulations. Antibody tests Does MedStar Health offer antibody tests? Yes, MedStar Health offers blood-based antibody tests. However, there are still no recommendations for the use of antibody tests to assess individuals, as these tests cannot effectively determine immunity to COVID. If you had the COVID-19 vaccine, it is most likely you will produce antibodies that are detected in laboratory tests. This may take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. However, the antibody tests do not measure the amount of antibody present. Nor do these tests guarantee the detected antibody neutralizes the SARS-COV-2 virus to prevent infection. Despite the production of antibodies after receiving the vaccine, we still recommend protection of yourself and others through appropriate use of masks and physical distancing. Remember, the best vaccines are still only 95 percent effective. And, while a vaccine might prevent you from developing severe disease, you may still pass the virus on to others. To request a test, please contact your primary care provider's office. Your provider will arrange for you to receive the necessary referral orders for bloodwork at an approved lab. Testing will be performed at MedStar Health or a reference laboratory that uses a similarly rigorous testing system, such as Quest or LabCorp, as designated by your insurance provider. Our primary care and urgent care sites will offer pre- and post-test counseling so that you understand your results and what they mean. Can an antibody test be used to determine if I'm currently infected with COVID-19? No. Antibody tests look for antibodies that the body makes after exposure to the virus. Because it takes time for your body to make antibodies, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not recommend using an antibody test to diagnose COVID-19. Treatments Most individuals with COVID symptoms don't require anything other than over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. However, if your symptoms are more severe, call your doctor for guidance. There are several outpatient treatment options for the treatment of COVID-19 for patients at high risk for severe disease. MedStar Health is proud to offer all currently available treatments for COVID-19 infection. Treatments must be started within 5-7 days of the start of COVID-19 symptoms. To better understand the available treatments and which treatments are appropriate for you, we encourage you to seek guidance from a healthcare provider: - If you have a MedStar Health Primary Care Provider, contact your provider and notify them that you have symptoms of possible COVID-19 (or a positive COVID-19 test if applicable). - If you do not have a MedStar Health Primary Care Provider but would like to see one for an evaluation of your COVID-19 symptoms, [click here to find a provider](/doctors). - MedStar Health Urgent Care locations also offer COVID-19 testing and evaluation for available treatments. [Click here to find Urgent Care center near you](/locations). - MedStar eVisit providers are available for telehealth visits 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to help manage symptoms, understand quarantine, and review options for testing.
