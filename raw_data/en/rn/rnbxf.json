She has been more knowledgeable and resourceful than any other healthcare clinician I have seen. She has addressed my health on so many levels that has improve the quality of my life including hormonal issues, gut issues, weight loss, food allergies, and genetic mutations to name a few. She diagnosed two major health issues that other doctors missed, one being a severe gut infection where they wanted to remove my gall bladder. It was not my gall bladder at all, I had a stomach infection!!!! Once she treated this, I had no pain...and I still have my gallbladder! I also had a genetic mutation I was unaware of wreaking havoc on my body, all the other doctors told me there was nothing wrong with me. She found it, treated it, and all symptoms are gone now. As a woman, I was so frustrated with mainstream care, healthcare providers not listening to me, symptoms worsening, and feeling just plain awful physically. Dr. Jarvela has helped me to treat my hormonal issues, lose weight, identify nutrient deficiencies, and help me feel better. The most amazing part is that because I feel better this has overflowed into all areas of my life, what a great benefit! Office staff is fabulous, Katie and CJ are wonderful, organized, and always professional. Dr. Jarvela has a great attitude, she is easy to talk to, fun, great bedside manner, and I would recommend everyone see her! I cannot say enough amazing things about this amazing doc, her staff, and the clinic...I am so grateful I found her and the staff at ONM! Business owner information John R. 3/31/2015 Hello H K. Thank you for the fantastic review. We are so happy to hear that you had a great experience here at ONM. We try to provide the highest quality service and attention to all of our patients. We dedicate more time to our patients to understand their unique cases. We try to support our patients on all levels. We are also pleased to hear that you have had a good experience with our outstanding office staff. Thank you again and we look forward to seeing you in the future. Sincerely, Oregon Natural Medicine Natural health. Modern medicine - 3/25/2022 Dr Reynolds is great to work with. I think he's like doctors *used* to be when they took time to work through issues. We look at my lab work together, adjust meds as necessary, we talk about my life at home and how that might be impacting my health, we talk about my wellness activities...both physical and mental. He really does provide holistic healthcare, which I appreciate. I've been seeing Dr Reynolds quarterly for around five years. - 7/4/2022 I originally started seeing Dr. Reynolds for a specific medical concern several years ago, and received such excellent treatment and service that I have remained a patient ever since. He really cares about his patients and delivers exceptional healthcare at every appointment. I highly recommend him. - 11/18/2014 Searching for and finding a naturopath is an arduous process but once you know you've found the one who is right for you, then all is right with the world. The online search began with knowing that I wanted to find someone on the east side and knowing that I wanted a guy. Found him in Dr. John Reynolds, ND. This guy has helped me more than anyone else, including well, everyone. When you're not sick but just dealing with all the little naggy crap related to aging, well... Some of you know how it is. The staff is courteous and respectful. Katie, the office manager, is sweet and always helpful & CJ, the resident MA, gives the best jab this side of the pond. Soon I'll be starting neurofeedback with Dr. Shannon to try to eliminate my migraines, a malady that only developed in the last 5 years. How is that even possible? I'll let you know how it goes. I can't say enough about Dr. Reynolds, his staff, and Oregon Natural Medicine. So if you get the chance, choose them & say enough yourselves. Business owner information John R. 2/3/2015 Hello Tom. Thank you for the glowing review. I am glad we were able to help you. Our goal is to understand our patient's unique experiences and symptoms so that we can provide the best healthcare to them. We spend more time with our patients on initial and follow-up visits so that we can best address medical concerns. Our staff is wonderful and very caring with new and established patients. Thanks again for the review and we hope to hear about your experiences with neurofeedback! Oregon Natural Medicine - 9/7/2017 I did a laser nail treatment twice plus used the topping medicine, it didn't get better a bit :( Otherwise the stuff is nice and friendly ) - 3/31/2017 Dr. John Reynolds was the first naturopathic doctor I have been to and he and his staff were amazing. I am a nurse in the traditional health care system and didn't even know that there was another way to be cared for...and cared for is the key words here. I felt heard and was treated with respect and learned medical knowledge that I was never taught in nursing school. - 9/18/2017 I see Dr. Jarvela - My husband see's Dr. Reynolds. Both are fantastic and thorough! I have never had a physician who was this good! I highly recommend!!! - 10/3/2014 I've been working with Dr. Jarvela for a year and a half now and have watched my health improve amazingly. During our first appointment, we went through the entire health history form I had completed beforehand. I've never actually had a doctor go over one of those with me before! What impressed me immediately, was that she took copious notes and kept up with everything I was saying (despite me being a fast talker). After I told her everything that I was experiencing and what I hoped to receive help with, she succinctly summarized everything into a number of well-phrased treatment goals. It was apparent from her summaries that she really had listened to everything I had said. She then addressed how we could begin to approach each issue, ordered lab tests and sent me home with a typed copy of my tailor-made treatment plan. Of course, it's even more impressive that our treatment strategies have actually been very effective, despite the overwhelming number of problems I was initially having. Dr. Jarvela REALLY listens to what you are saying, has never tried to force any treatment approaches and provides lots of information about your options. I've also had the opportunity to work with Dr. Shannon Reive-Schmidt while Dr. Jarvela was out of the office. Dr. Reive-Schmidt is an amazing doctor, who also listens carefully and has a very gentle, kind bedside manner. Katie (office manager) and CJ (medical assistant) have always been pleasant, knowledgeable, efficient and reassuring. My experience continues to be very good with this office and I highly recommend it to anyone who is seeking naturopathic support with chronic health issues. - 1/29/2015Updated review My 2011 review wasn't showing up for some reason, so I decided to update it and include the old review below. First, what's changed? I have health insurance now, and Katie at the front desk makes it super easy to use. CJ, the resident nurse, is great about helping me with anything from drawing blood for testing to sending my charts to a referred fertility doctor. My husband and I still aren't pregnant, but we're getting a lot of help and emotional support from Dr. Jarvela, Dr. Reynolds, and the doctors they recommend us to when we need additional help. This infertility stuff isn't easy, but these doctors make it so much less painful than it could be. Also, many of my initial health problems that brought me to Dr. Jarvela to begin with are resolved due to the treatments she's prescribed over the past four years. I'm SO much healthier, have more energy, and haven't experienced anxiety in a very long time. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Dr. Jarvela and Dr. Reynolds are both wonderful! I have recommended them to every member of my family. Let me tell you why: I haven't had health insurance in many years and was afraid to look for a primary care physician because I thought it would be too expensive. That is, until my partner and I both visited urgent care clinics within six months of each other and had terrible experiences. We felt like we were rushed through and weren't listened to. That's when I started looking for a doctor who would take the time to get to know me and my family, and I found Oregon Natural Medicine. My partner and I were both experiencing problems with anxiety and depression, so he scheduled an appointment to see Dr. Reynolds because he specializes in men's health, and I scheduled to see Dr. Jarvela. Both of our new patient visits lasted over an hour and a half and were extremely thorough. I left the clinic feeling not only listened to but understood. My partner felt the same way. And when it came time to pay, knowing that we don't have insurance, the doctors gave us a discount and since then have been incredibly conscious of the cost of the procedures they recommend for us. As a matter of fact, Dr. Jarvela ordered some tests for me and went to the trouble to find the least expensive labs available, even though it required her to do more paperwork. And the best part? After taking the supplements prescribed to us, my partner and I are feeling SO much better! The time and attention these doctors have given us make us feel like they truly care. They emphasize that they are available to answer questions via email, and they even look little extra things up without being asked. For example, Dr. Jarvela knows that my partner and I would like to try to have a baby soon, so she looked up a book about fertility for me and emailed me information about it. Seriously, these are the kinds of doctors that deserve accolades for the quality of care they give. Oh, one more thing that I was impressed by: they list a lot of their prices on their website. If you click on the \"Schedule Now\" button, you'll find a list of prices. These are all for insured patients; uninsured patients get charged less for most things. I will be using Dr. Jarvela for all of my female needs until the day I get pregnant. And my partner wants to keep Dr. Reynolds as his primary care physician, too. Business owner information John R. 2/3/2015 Hello Jaime. Thank you for the wonderful review. Our hope is to provide the highest quality support to our patients. We dedicate more time to our patients so that we can fully understand their unique cases better. We also feel it is imperative for patients to feel comfortable with our treatments and understand why we are recommending them. Lastly, it is important to support our patients mentally and emotionally as well as physically. Thank you again and we look forward to seeing you in the future.

He's very knowledgeable and really desires to help out and communicate professionally and effectively. I was glad we grabbed our Groupons when we did. Now we're on a path to heal the issues I've been dealing with and I'm stoked! I even showed up late and they were very polite and understanding. The location is awesome for us and the building is homey (it was a home) and the atmosphere is pleasant. My wife has been very happy working with Dr. Jarvela too. We feel very proactive and productive with our decision to work with ONM. Thanks to Jon and Karina!
