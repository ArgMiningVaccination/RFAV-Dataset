Unhealthy diet Toxic exposures Social stressors Obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer Alzheimer's, dementia, Parkinson's Low birth weight Early life experiences influence later -life health, disease risks Aging begins at conception US food consumption 300 more daily calories than 25 yrs. ago Calories from added fats and oils increased by 69 percent over 40 yrs. Sugar and sweeteners are about 36- 40 % of the growing consumption of carbohydrates. Fewer than \u00bc of people in the US eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily Meat consumption in the US is among the top three countries in the world. 22% is processed. Increase risks otrans fats and many ohigh glycemic fats olow glycemic carbohydrate oMediterranean diet Nutrition and Chronic Disease Diet and chronic disease risk Mediterranean- like diet -Intervention studies: 50-70% reduction in cardiovascular related events, mortality; insulin resistance; diabetes, particularly combined with exercise (150 min. moderate intensity weekly) -Decreased risk of various kinds of cancer Childhood, adolescent diet and breast cancer whole soy food in childhood and adolescence > 50% decreased breast cancer risk meat in adolescence > 35% increased pre - menopausal breast cancer risk (NHS II) dietary vegetable protein, fat, nuts in girls 9- 15 associated with decreased risk of benign breast disease at age 30 (Growing Up Today Study) The environment and vitamin D Inadequate vitamin D status is common 30-50% of US population have insufficient levels (Endocrine Society; IOM committee) Obese /overweight children much more likely to have low levels Diverse consequences (bone, breast, immune) ACOG: screen women at risk and supplement American Academy of Pediatrics: ALL infants receive a vitamin D supplement Global food system Accounts for approximately one third of all climate changing green house gas emissions through land use change and direct emissions Farm animal production accounts for about 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions A major contributor to unsustainable, excessive water consumption. Livestock alone accounts for more than 8 percent of global water use. Interconnections Between Nutrition and Environmental Impacts Barilla Centre for Food and Nutrition www.barillacfn.com 20 Energy Water use Water pollution Air pollution Greenhouse gases Environmental chemicals The US produces or imports 42 billion pounds of chemicals daily Used in countless consumer products About 3000 chemicals are produced or used at > one million pounds per year Carcinogens, reproductive/developmental, neurological hazards Thousands of inadequately -tested and poorly - regulated substances Environmental chemical and contaminant exposures Exposures are common (CDC biomonitoring) Pesticides: adverse impact on neurodevelopment, increase Parkinson's disease risk, cancer Endocrine disruptors : e.g. bisphenol A: prenatal exposures (? prostate and breast cancer risks) Lead, mercury, other metals Air pollution: low birth weight, cardiovascular disease, asthma, diabetes, cognitive decline ACOG Committee Opinion: Exposure to Toxic Environmental Agents Health Benefits of Physical Activity Improved insulin sensitivity; > 50% reduced risk of diabetes when combined with healthy diet (NEJM; 2002) Improved cardiovascular health Reduced risk of cognitive decline and dementia Reduced risk of cancer A component of weight control Increasing physical activity at all ages improves physical and emotional wellbeing. Personal correlates with activity levels In adolescents, increased physical activity levels correlate with: - being male, higher previous physical activity levels, confidence in ability, family and social support. In adults: -health status and confidence in ability -personal history of physical activity (Bauman, Lancet, 2012; Altonen, Scand J Med Sci Sports , 2013; Ding, Am J Prev Med, 2011) Environmental correlates with physical activity levels Children, young people -neighborhood walkability, -traffic speed and volume, -transportation environment -land -use mix (proximity of homes and destinations such as shops), -residential density, -access or proximity to recreation facilities Environmental correlates with physical activity levels For adults \u2014strongest associations: -availability and location of recreation facilities, -the transportation environment, -aesthetics Socioeconomic, Psychosocial Environment Lower socioeconomic status risk of impaired neurodevelopment, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, many kinds of cancer, asthma. Due to: Combinations of increased exposures to hazards, increased susceptibility, decreased capacity to cope and recover. Elevated baseline levels of inflammatory markers, stress hormones http://www.unnaturalcauses.org/reso urces.php Design problems Our individual and collective activities, choices, and policies have designed many of these problems into the fabric of our communities and society An individual approach to preventing illness Personal Level - \"Approaches to Healthy Living\" Eat healthy food- whole, fresh, unprocessed, plant based Avoid hazardous chemical exposures whenever possible Exercise Be socially engaged Regional, diversified and sustainable food production; reconfiguration of crop subsidies and insurance programs Clean, renewable energy air pollution, chemical exposures Partnerships to improve active transport and recreation programs Chemical policy regulatory reform; Safer substitute programs and green product design Address socioeconomic disparities in policy development Re-designing for individual, community ,and environmental health "}
