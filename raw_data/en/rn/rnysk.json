How are we coping with the pandemic? - Annex 2 - Results 29 2. Detail ed results for study pillar 2 and 3 (research question 2 -4) 2.1. Study selection The comprehensive search for systematic reviews/meta- analyses as well as for primary studies in ten literature databases and living evidence syntheses yielded a total of 7009 references . After de- duplication, 4003 studies had to be screened at title/abstract level. Based on the eligible reviews and primary studies, that were included until March 29, 2021, two additional searches (1. systematic reviews/meta- analyses, 2. primary studies) were performed in Microsof t Academic Graph (MAG), resulting in 3593 further studies . Therefore, following another de- duplication, we finally screened the titles/abstracts of 7596 studies . At the full -text level, we screened 537 full -text articles for eligibility. Finally , 90 primar y studies from 105 reports (i.e., longitudinal studies, repeated cross -sectional studies) and 27 s ys tematic reviews /meta- analys es (from 27 reports) were included. 2.2. Detailed results for research question 2 - Psychosocial and mental health effects of the Cov id-19 pandemic and policy responses 2.2.1. Detailed results of the identified primary studies Across the different population groups, we identified 90 primary observational studies comprising 104 samples. Since five studies/reports groups simultaneously and Varga and colleagues (2021) reported four studies in three EU -based countries, the number of primary studies analysed for this report comprised 98 studies when being considered for each population group separately. Most of these studies focused on the general population (28 studies) and various patient populations (24 studies) , followed by young to middle- aged individuals (12 studies), children and adolescents (10 studies) and older adults (10 studies), those with particular risk exposure (e.g., caregivers; seven studies), and employees (healthcare and non - healthcare; five studies). If the findings on mental health were reported separately in the publications, specific sub- samples within mixed populations were directly assigned to the respective population group, resulting in two studies in mixed populations. With respect to the EU Member States and the UK, most of the primary studies assessed mental health outcome data in the UK (28), Spain (17), Italy (16), and the Netherlands (14). Regarding the pre- specified mental health outcomes, none of the included studies was performed in Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Of the 90 studies, 44 compared different mental health outcomes prior to and during the Covi d - 19 pandemic. In 36 studies, mental health was measured at least two times during the pandemic, ten studies combined both forms of assessments. Sixty -eight studies used longitudinal designs with repeated assessments in the same individuals, while 17 were repeated cross -sectional designs measuring mental health in different individuals at several time points. Two s tudies combined both study designs and three studies performed a cross -cohort analysis (i.e., comparison between two different cohorts before and during the Covid -19 pandemic), or combined it with a longitudinal study. STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology 30 For all population groups , Table 1 and Table 2 present the detailed findings of the vote counting for the change in the mental health outcomes from before to during the pandemic as well as in the pandemic timeline, clustered by the severity of containment measures and the outcome assessed, and including the study IDs and the effect sizes (if reported in the publications). Table 3 contains the results of the analysis for the potential impact of the support measures implemented in the EU Member States. Across all population groups, the following mental health outcomes have been assessed : Loneliness (general population, patients, young to middle -aged individuals, older adul ts, individuals with particular risk exposure1) Anxiety symptoms and/or worrying (general population, patients, employees, children/adolescents, young to middle -aged individuals, older adults, individuals with particular risk exposure) Depressive symptoms (general population, patients, employees, children/adolescents, young to middle -aged individuals, older adults, individuals with particular risk exposure) Stress symptoms and/or perceived stress (general population, patients, employees, young to middle -aged individuals, individuals with particular risk exposure) Sleep problems and/or sleep quality (general population, patients, employees, young to middle -aged individuals, older adults) General psychological distress and/or general mental health (general population, patients, employees, children/adolescents, young to middle -aged individuals, older adults, individuals with particular risk exposure) Peri-/posttraumatic stress symptoms (general population, patients, children/adolescents ) Substance use/abuse (gen eral population, employees, young -aged individuals ) Self-harm (patients ) Suicidal ideation (general population, young to middle -aged individuals ) Well- being and quality of life (general population, patients, children/adolescents, young to middle -aged individuals, older adults, individuals with particular risk exposure) Detailed results of the primary studies for each population group are presented in Table 4 to Table 11. In individuals with particular risk exposure - a population group not in the focus of this report - the primary studies reported stable values for depressive symptoms, general psychological distress, and well -being during the pandemic compared to bef ore. However, the number of available data is very limited. From the three available before- during comparisons, no change of mental health outcomes was identified in all three comparisons. Based on few available data, mental health mostly remained stable during the pandemic (depressive symptoms, stress). Loneliness increased, while mixed results were found for symptoms of anxiety and well -being. From the 16 available comparisons of mental health outcomes in the pandemic timeline, mental health remained stable or improved in 13 cases, while it deteriorated in three comparisons. Two studies (two samples; see Table 11) assessed mental health in mixed populations . One of them considered the general population and patients with rheumatic disease (Koppert, 2020); the second one included older adults with subjective cognitive decline (Soldevila- Domenech, 2021). 2.2.1.1. Impact of containment measures - further details Using the Public Health and S ocial Measures (PHSM ) Severity Index ( see Annex 1 - Methods and main publication) and for before -during mental health changes , there seemed to be no difference between weak and moderate/severe measures of containment in several population groups, including the general population, patient popul ations, and young to middle- aged individuals (e.g., deterioration of mental health in the general population independent of weak or moderate policy reponses). Even under consistently weak containment measures , inconsistent 1 No population group in the focus of this report. How are we coping with the pandemic? - Annex 2 - Re sults 31 changes of mental health were reported for children and adolescents. For older adults, conclusions regarding the mental health impact of containment measures were rendered difficult due to the restriction of before- during comparisons to no/weak measures. During the pandemic , the difference between weak/moderate and severe policy responses was also not clear (e.g., general population). For patient populations, different changes in mental health were reported under consistently weak containment measures. Similarly, we found mixed results for the tightening or easement of containment measures during the pandemic for several population groups with either no change and/or an improvement of mental symptoms (e.g., patient populations, young to middle- aged individuals). In the general population, mental health mostly remained stable if containment measures were eased from severe to moderate/weak/no measures. 2.2.1.2. Impact of support measures - further details The total SMI score for the EU Member States, where the included studies had been conducted in, ranged from 7 (Denmark) to 15 (Belgium). The subscale financial/economic support measures ranged from 0 (Denmark) to 6 (Spain, the UK), for work-related support measures from 3 (the Czech Republic) to 6 (Austria, Belgium, France, the Netherlands), the domain for support measures in the health system from 2 (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, the UK) to 3 (the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Sweden), and the subscale for psychological support measur es from 1 (Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the UK) to 2 (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal). Overall, there was relatively little variance in support measures across the different EU Member States and the UK. Thirteen of the 15 considered countries had a comparatively high SMI total score between 12 and 14. In the country with the highest total SMI, Belgium, there was a deterioration in mental health after the onset of the pandemic. Data on the change over the course of the pandemic were not available. In Denmark, the country with the lowest SMI total score, a deterioration of mental health compared to before the onset of the pandemic as well as in the pandemic timeline was also reported (7 comparisons). However, data for the pre-during comparison were very limited and the primary studies mostly reported stable or improved values of mental health outcomes during the pandemic. Among the 14 EU Member States with SMI total scores between 10 and 14, mental health compared to before the pandemic predominantly declined in two countries for which very little data were available (Austria, Belgium), while mixed results were reported for seven countries (the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the UK), and no data were reported for four countries (France, Ireland, Porland, Portugal). For Italy (SMI=12), stable or improved mental health outcomes slightly outweighed a decline of mental health. When comparing several asses sments over the course of the pandemic, nine EU Member States with an SMI total score of 10-14 mostly showed stable or improved mental health (Austria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, the UK), whereas mixed findings were reported for Ireland, and no data were availale for four countries (Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Sweden). For Denmark (lowest SMI of 7), a similar trajectory of mental health with stable or improved values outweighing a decline was found. STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology 32 Table 1.

How are we coping with the pandemic? - Annex 2 - Re sults 147 2.2.2. Detailed results of the identified systematic reviews and meta -analyses 2.2.2.1. General population and other adult population groups For all population groups, the detailed findings of the identified evidence syntheses, including the pooled prevalence rates for mental health outcomes, if available, are presented in Table 12. Most of the evidence regarding the mental health effects of the Covid -19 pandemic in previous evidence syntheses relied on cross -sectional studies (i.e., only single assessment during the Covid - 19 pandemic ). The meta- analyses frequently overlapped concerning the primary studies that they included. Prepandemic data of mental health in the general population before the Covid -19 pandemic have been reported for the prevalence of mental symptoms in the European Region (see Table 13), for example, based on the Global Burden of Disease Study or the WHO World Mental Health Surveys. By comparing these prepandemic data with the pooled prevalence rates of mental health outcomes in the evidence syntheses found in this report, the mental burden caused by the Covid -19 pandemic in the general population and further population groups can be estimated. General population. Compared to the available prepandemic prevalence of mental symptoms (2005- 2019), the pandemic is likely to have increased the level of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and psychological distress in the general population (see Figur e 57). Given the various stressors and traumatic events that may lead to the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms, no adequate prepandemic data in the general population are available for this symptom category. For sleep problems (e.g., insomnia), it has to be considered that even the prepandemic data varied substantially between different EU Member States and also depended on the symptoms assessed. Patient populations. Compared with the prepandemic prevalence of mental symptoms in the general popul ation, the Covid -19 pandemic is likely to have increased the level of symptoms of anxiety, depression and psychological distress in pregnant/postpartum women , and the level of sleep problems in Covid -19 patients (see Figure 57 ). Employees (healthcare and n on-healthcare). We identified only systematic reviews and meta- analyses in healthcare staff. Compared with the prepandemic prevalence of mental symptoms in the general population, the Covid -19 pandemic is likely to have increased the level of anxiety and de pre ssive symptoms in healthcare workers (see Figure 57 ). Young to middle -aged individuals. Compared with the prepandemic prevalence of mental symptoms in the general population, the Covid -19 pandemic is likely to have increased the level of anxiety and d e pre ssive symptoms in young to middle- aged individuals (see Figure 57 ). Individuals with particular risk exposure. Compared with the prepandemic prevalence of mental symptoms in the general population, the Covid -19 pandemic is likely to have increased the level of anxiety and depressive symptoms in family caregivers ( Figure 57 ).

Children and adolescents Prepandemic data of mental health in the children and adolescents before the Covid -19 pandemic have been reported for the prevalence of mental symptoms (see Table 14). These prepandemic data can be used to estimate the mental burden caused by the Covid -19 pandemic in children and adolescents. Table 14. Prepandemic data on the prevalence of mental symptoms in previous representative surveys (children and adolescents) in EU Member States Mental s ymptoms Pooled prevalences of mental sym p to m s during the Covid -19 pandemic found in meta- anays es ingle EU Member States (children/adoles cents ) before the Covid-19 Anxiety Netherlands ; Luijten, 2021) Ps ychological d i stre ss ymptoms : 79.4% (Panda, 2021) 9.9% (2017; Ravens Sieberer 2021a) 17.6% (NR; mental range in s chool ample; Philipp, 2018) Sleep problems -19: disease 2019; EU: European Union. Compared with this prepandemic prevalence of mental symptoms, the Covid -19 pandemic is likely to have increas ed the level of anxiety and depres s ive s ymptoms in children and adolescents. The proportion of children/adolescents reporting sleep problems during the Covid -19 pandemic was mostly similar to prepandemic data (see Figure 58 ). A comparison for psychological distress and behaviour problems is rendered difficult, based on the limited available data and the lack of congruence in the symptoms assessed. However, there is a also a tendency for an increase of these mental health problems amid the Covid -19 pandemic compared to before ( see Table 14).

EU Member States & population group as moderator - further details The findings of the narrative synthesis to explore the role of the EU Member States as a moderator for the mental health impact of the Covid -19 pandemic are also contained in Table 3. Table 15 presents the results of the analysis of the population group as a moderator. Changes in mental health from before to during the pandemic in different EU Memb er States . When considering all available comparisons in mental health outcomes between before and during the pandemic in the included primary studies, the populations in two EU Member States experienced a deterioration of mental health, namely in Austria and Belgium, although the available data were very limited. Most of the primary studies, that had been conducted in a single Member State or that reported separate data for different Member States (e.g., Varga, 2021), reported mixed findings regarding ment al health changes compared to before the pandemic, including the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. Stable or improved mental health outcomes slightly outweighed a decline of mental health in Italy, although no major difference to other countries is discernible. No data were available for four countries (France, Ireland, Poland, Portugal). The very restricted number of comparisons does also limit the results in case of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Spain, and Sweden. Changes in mental health during the pandemic. In four countries considered by the included primary studies, the participants experienced no change or an improvement of mental health over the course of the pandemic (predominantly first wave), including Austria , France, the Netherlands , and Portugal . For six countries (Denmark, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the UK), the stability or improvement of mental health (compared to previous values from the pandemic) outweighed a deterioration, while the results were mixed and rather limited for Ireland. No data were available for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, and Sweden. In addition, the small number of reported comparisons is an important limitation in case of Austria, France, Ireland, and the Netherlands . 2.3.2. Individual risk/protective factors - further details In the identified s ys tematic reviews and meta- analys es , the potential role of risk and protective factors has been examined by various methods (e.g., statistical subgroup analyses contr asting different subgroups of studies; narrative analysis). Table 16 focuses on those categories of risk and protective factors that were examined in the included reviews and for which the review authors found evide nce bas ed on a narrative s ummary or meta- analysis (i.e., statistical evidence). The most potential moderators for the mental health impact of the pandemic have been studied in the general population . However, given the limited number of reviews focusing on other populations, only a limited number of moderators were inspected in reviews on specific population groups like patients with pre- existing (chronic) health conditions, children and adolescents, young to middle- aged individuals, older adults, or those with particular risk exposure. Since the risk and protective factors in systematic reviews on mixed populations were mostly not analysed separately, we did not consider them to answer RQ 3 and RQ 4. We only present the direction of the association between a specific factor and mental health which was reported in the primary study or review . This means that if a factor has been shown to be a risk factor (e.g., younger age, low income), the opposite manifestation of this factor (e.g., older age, high income) could also be considered a protective factor for mental health. More detailed information on all reported factors (including those for which there was no [statistical] eviden of being a risk or protective factor, inconsistent evidence in a population, or the statistical significance was How are we coping with the pandemic? - Annex 2 - Re sults 167 unclear2) for both primary studies and syste ma tic reviews syste ma tic reviews can be reques ted from the authors of this report. ce 2 For example, in subgroup analyses, conducted as part of meta -analyses, the results of the statistical test for subgroup differences were not always reported.

Detailed results for research question 5 - Policy recommendations and (evidence-based) guidelines 2.4.1. Search in PubMed The search yielded 1518 results in total. Based on the incl usion/exclusion criteria, 234 studie s were included for this report (see Figure 59). The included studies can be categorised by six topic s. Healthcare and healthcare s ervices The studies showed that the coronavirus crisis did put a large burden on healthcare systems and healthcare services. The pandemic changed the way patients were able to seek healthcare advice from healthcare professionals and how healthcare services and medical interventions were given. There was an (often- significant ) rise in out -of-hospital cardiac arrests, a decline in first response and increase in response time, a decrease in hospital admissions for stroke and heart attacks, and general longer time periods from event to treatment (Aguiar de Sousa, 2020; Bugger, 2020). Patients with cancer often experienced examination and treatment delays as well as delays in surgical procedures compared to the year preceeding Covid -19 (Amaddeo, 2021; Balakrishnan, 2020). Furthermore, there were postponed dentist and orthoptic visits with only emergency procedures conducted, an increase of hospitalisation and a decrease of check -ups in people living with HIV, a decrease of patients in the dermatology and orthopedic departments of hospitals as well as in the ear, nose throat treatments and organ transplantations, and a general significant decrease i n emergency hospital visits across many different medical flow diagram (study sele ction process, PubMed search) How are we coping with the pandemic? - Annex 2 - Results 171 Changed health behaviour s In general, the studies showed that a healthy diet and regular moderate physical activity have a positive impact on the mental health of the participants (e.g., Cecchini, 2021), but stricter lockdown and Covid -19-related policy measures led to an increase in adverse health behaviours (e.g., decreased consumption of fruit and vegetables, increased physical inactivity, snacking and overall food intake, as well as consumption of alcoholic beverages and cigarettes; Mart\u00ednez -de-Quel, 2021; Sidor, 2020). Thus, organised nutritional support and targeted physical activity interventions might also prevent negative mental health outcomes during the pandemic and in the post - pandemic era. Telemedicine Overall, telemedicine seemed to be accepted by most patients and even preferred by some, as it enabled professional consultations while still adhering to social distancing regulations. For instance, a facility for stoma care in Italy found no decrease in consultations due to telemedicine, and follow -ups for patients with cardiovascular implanted devices in Poland where positively received by the patients (Dinuzzi, 2021; Paskudzka, 2020). Attitudes towards Covid -19-related meas ures In general, differences could be found concerning the degree of acceptance and adherence to regulations, depending, upon others, on country, demographic factors, and health status. One study from Italy investigated the degree of adherence during the third week of lockdown in a large population sample. Results showed that adherence differed depending on demographic factors, with women, middle- aged people, and people with higher education adhering stronger to the regulations (Carlucci, 2020). Another study fr om Belgium found a coherence between a decrease in mental health and the lack of social support with an increase in difficulty to adhere to Covid -19- related social distancing rules (Frissen, 2020). Vaccine behaviour Seven studies showed a general acceptanc e of the vaccine in the broad population but also hesitancy, especially in minority populations and subgroups. One study in Greece found that vaccination acceptance and the willingness to get the vaccine were higher in people with older age, for individual s with vulnerable people in their near surroundings, and those with an understanding of the health risks associated with an infection of Covid -19 (Kourlaba, 2021). An Italian study examined vaccine hesitancy among students and found that around 14% were unwilling or unsure about getting the Covid -19 vaccine (Barello, 2020). A study from England showed that especially ethnic minorities where three times as likely to reject the vaccine in comparison to the White population of England (Bell, 2020). Beyond the PubMed search for this report, a lower vaccination willingness amongst patients with mental illness was only partly found (Jefsen, 2021; Mazereel, 2021). However, since there is a relationship between mental health conditions on the one hand and an increas ed risk of Covid -19 infection, severe complications, and subsequent mortality in patients with mental illness (Cipriani, 2021; Smith, 2021), policy measures to foster vaccination acceptance in this subgroup might be appropriate (e.g., communication and public health campaigns). Health literacy and trust in governments and Covid -19 regulations Two studies apiece on health literacy, trust and knowledge, and the effect s of government interventions showed the importance of understanding and of trust in the gov ernment, health organisations, and vaccination in general. A study from Germany examined the Covid -19-related health knowledge in adults and found that especially health literacy was an important factor in navigating the vast amount of information on Covid -19 facts and regulations (Okan, 2020). A Europe- wide study examining the differences of trust found that higher trust in the government and Covid -19 regulations was associated with lower Covid -19-related mortality (Oksanen, 2020). While the search on PubM ed did not yield results on policy recommendations and evidence- based guidelines, the results of the studies can still be considered when designing guidelines. Firstly, the pandemic has had a tremendous impact on non- Covid -19-related healthcare and healthc are use, STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology 172 suggesting a large health impact on a broad spectrum of people and patients suffering from different diseases and health problems. From general check -ups to urgent surgical procedures, the Covid -19 pandemic has had an impact on how medical consult ations and procedures were conducted, which leads to the necessity for better preparedness of such situations. Furthermore, modern technologies such as telemedicine can also be seen as a valuable tool for upholding medical consultations in pandemic times, as studies show that it is accepted by many patients. Concerning physical activity and dietary behaviours, organised nutritional support and physical activity interventions are necessary, especially targeting vulnerable groups. Vaccination behaviour and the acceptance of vaccination can be strengthened by increasing communication and public health campaigns and targeting especially minorities and subgroups with strong anti -v accine tendencies or those who are unsure about getting the vaccine or not . Physical distancing behaviours can be enhanced by mitigating factors that decrease adherence, such as strengthening public mental healthcare and support. Targeted public health campaigns could help strengthening institutional trust and health literacy as well. 2.4.2. Recommendations from previous systematic reviews/meta - analyses and from EU mental health organisations The systematic reviews and meta- analyses identified for this report provided several recommendations for practice based on their findings (see Table 17). Table 18 includes the previous recommendations from EU mental health organisations, such as the WHO Technical Advisory Board (TAG) for mental health impacts. Table 17.
