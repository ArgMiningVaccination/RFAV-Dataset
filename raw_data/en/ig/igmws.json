Vibrant Health! goes a step farther. Dr. Moore believes that people who exemplify Vibrant Health! radiate a combination of serenity and vitality that can only be attained by becoming more fully conscious: making deliberate, well-informed choices in every moment. Dr. Lisa Moore Dr. Moore is a graduate, magna cum laude, from Palmer College of Chiropractic. She is passionate about helping people find balance through her practice and teaching. In her practice, she uses Network Spinal Analysis and Applied Kinesiology incorporated with nutrition, gentle corrective techniques, exercise, and aromatherapy (essential oils). Her focuses include injury rehab, natural menopause, women's health, digestive and immune enhancement, and pediatric health. Chiropractic Care A healthy nervous system must be free of interference so that it can receive sensory input from all parts of the body and send outgoing messages in return. Chiropractic care aims to remove these impediments using a holistic approach that includes manual treatments of the spine and joints (adjustments), specific therapeutic exercise programs, muscle massage, trigger point therapy, nutritional assessments, and lifestyle recommendations. A body in proper alignment is free to express it's natural state of optimal health! Essential Oils Dr. Moore uses therapeutic-grade essential oils to complement her in-office chiropractic and may suggest appropriate oils for take-home support. It's very helpful to have a basic home-health kit when certain situations arise - colds and flu, aches and pains, and emotional release are all facilitated by the use of nature's medicine. Food, herbs, and essential oils are the best medicine. If you would like to order your own essential oils you may do so through "}
