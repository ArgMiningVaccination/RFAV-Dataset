Thus, prevention by avoidance of undercooked meat or seafood, avoidance of unpasteurized milk orsoft cheese, and selected use of available typhoid vac-cines for travelers to areas where typhoid is endemicare key to the control of infectious diarrhea. INTRODUCTION Two converging factors highlight the growing need for clear guidelines for the diagnosis and managementof infectious diarrhea. First, there is increasing recog-nition of a widening array of enteric pathogens asso-ciated with illnesses of the gastrointestinal tract. Agentssuch as enterohemorrhagic E. coli, referred to here cause 1200 million cases of di- arrheal illnesses in the United States each year. Manyof these organisms are easily transmitted through foodor water or from one person to another, and some aredevastating to individuals with compromised immunesystems or structural abnormalities of the gastrointes-tinal tract. With the rapid globalization and industri-alization of our food supply and with a multiplicity ofrecognized pathogens and diagnostic tools, the chal-lenges of determining optimal, cost-effective means forappropriate diagnosis, clinical management, and publichealth control of diarrheal illnesses are great. The second factor arises from our having entered an era when health care is increasingly managed with aneye to cost containment. Critical to developing a cost-effective approach to the evaluation and managementof infectious diarrhea is the selective use of available332xCID 2001:32 (1 February) xGuerrant et al.Table 1. Categories indicating the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence on which they are based.

These must be targeted to the clinical scenarios in which they willyield the greatest bene\u00aets, and certain factors must be takeninto account: the patient's history, exposure, and immunestatus, and the nature of the illness: its severity and durationand whether the process is in\u00afammatory or hemorrhagic. Clear guidelines are needed for the application of diagnostic methods to identify enteric infections that require speci\u00aec therapyor are responsive to control measures. The six recommendationsare summarized in table 2 and in \u00aegure 1. The recommendationsaddress the following: oral rehydration, clinical and epidemio-logical evaluation, performance of selective fecal studies, admin-istration of selective antimicrobial therapy, contraindicated an-tidiarrheals, and available immunizations. These guidelines willcontinue to evolve as improved understanding of pathogenesisand development and use of inexpensive, rapid tests improvediagnosis and management of infectious diarrheal illness, one ofthe most common clinical syndromes in our society. GOALS These recommendations are intended to provide clinicians and public health practitioners with a consensus-based docu-ment that will aid in the management of acute diarrhea byaddressing which patients to test, what tests to order, whatmedical treatments to use, and what steps to take to ensurethat appropriate public health actions are implemented. Theauthors include internists, pediatricians, public health leaders,and laboratory directors with recognized expertise in entericinfectious diseases. Discussions of clinical features and rec-ommendations are based on extensive MEDLINE searches, and speci\u00aec citations are given throughout. Wherever possible these recommendations are evidence- based and provide indications regarding the quality of availableevidence (on a scale of I to III) and the degree of certainty fora given recommendation (on a scale of A to E; table 1) [1, 2]. This document identi\u00aees areas where key research questions relating to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diarrhealdiseases remain unanswered. These guidelines will need to beupdated as additional information becomes available, and aprocess of periodic revisions will be needed to maintain thetimelines of this document. The information provided hereinis intended to provide a working framework for clinicians andpublic health providers and should not override or be construedas a substitute for sound clinical decision-making. DEFINITIONS \u00aaDiarrhea\u00ba is an alteration in a normal bowel movement characterized by an increase in the water content, volume, orfrequency of stools. A decrease in consistency (i.e., soft or liq-uid) and an increase in frequency of bowel movements to >3 stools per day have often been used as a de\u00aenition for epide-miological investigations. \u00aaInfectious diarrhea\u00ba is diarrhea dueto an infectious etiology, often accompanied by symptoms ofnausea, vomiting, or abdominal cramps. \u00aaAcute diarrhea\u00ba isan episode of diarrhea of <14 days in duration. \u00aaPersistent diarrhea\u00ba is diarrhea of 114 days in duration. Although we will not categorize persistent diarrhea further here, some expertsrefer to diarrhea that lasts 130 days as \u00aachronic.\u00baIDSA GUIDELINES xCID 2001:32 (1 February) x333Table 2.

BACKGROUND Infectious diarrheal diseases are the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [3\u00b15]. In the United Statesalone, an estimated 211\u00b1375 million episodes of diarrheal illnessoccur each year, resulting in 73 million physician consultations,1.8 million hospitalizations, and 3100 deaths. Foodborne ill-nesses alone account for 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospi-talizations, and 5000 deaths each year [6\u00b18]. In addition toacute morbidity and mortality, some causes of infectious di-arrhea result in serious long-term sequelae such as hemolyticuremic syndrome (HUS) with renal failure following STECinfection (also known as enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection), Guillain-Barre \u00c2 syndrome following C. jejuni infection [9], and malnutrition with or without diarrhea following infection withenteroaggregative E. coli ,Cryptosporidium species, or perhaps other enteric infections [10\u00b113]. There is also a growing awareness of the potentially huge impact, in the developing world, of long-term disability causedby repeated early childhood enteric infections [5, 14]. The ec-onomic costs of infectious diarrheal diseases are considerablealso. In the United States an estimated $6 billion each year isspent on medical care and lost productivity due to foodbornediseases, most of which cause diarrhea [15, 16]. Another reportestimated that in 1988 alone, $23 billion was spent for 99million cases of diarrhea, 250,000 of which required hospital-ization [17]. Despite the economic and societal burdens ofdiarrheal illnesses, few clinical guidelines exist for the diagnosis and treatment of persons with suspected infectious diarrhea.The considerable geographic and interspecialty variability inclinical practice has been recently observed to demonstrate aclear need for such clinical diagnostic guidelines that are evi-dence-based and cost effective [18]. Clinical health care providers and public health practitioners have overlapping interests in the recognition and treatment ofinfectious diarrhea. For clinicians, early diagnosis of an acuteepisode of diarrhea can lead to interventions that alleviatesymptoms and prevent secondary transmission. For publichealth practitioners, prompt noti\u00aecation of pathogen-speci\u00aecdiagnoses and subtyping of bacterial isolates through publichealth surveillance can lower rates of transmission and lead totimely detection and control of outbreaks. Because both cli-nicians and public health practitioners share overlapping re-sponsibilities for the diagnosis, management, and preventionof infectious diarrheal diseases, these guidelines contain rec-ommendations for both groups. T o reduce the morbidity andmortality associated with infectious diarrhea, the clinical andpublic health practitioner communities must work closely to-gether to identify optimal diagnostic, treatment, and preventionmethods. Diarrheal illness is a problem worldwide, with substantial regional variation in the prevalence of speci\u00aec pathogens, theavailability of means of diagnosis and treatment, and the degree334xCID 2001:32 (1 February) xGuerrant et al.

Right-side abdominal pain without high fever but with bloody or nonbloody diarrhea should prompt culture for Shiga toxin\u00b1producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157.4Proctitis in symptomatic homosexual men can be diagnosed with sigmoidoscopy. Involvement in only the distal 15 cm suggests herpesvirus, gonococcal, chlamydial, giardiasis.5Postdiarrheal hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) should prompt testing of stools for STEC O157 and for Shiga toxin (send isolates to reference laboratory if toxin-positive but STEC-negative).6Outbreaks should prompt reporting to health department. Consider saving culture plates and isolates and freeze whole stools or swabs at 270&C.7Fecal lactoferrin testing or microscopy for leukocytes can help document in\u00afammation, which is often present in invasive colitis with Salmonella, Shigella, orCampylobacter, with more severe C. dif\u00aecile colitis, and with in\u00afammatory bowel disease.8Some experts recommend avoiding administration of antimicrobial agents to persons in the United States with bloody diarrhea.9Commonly used tests for parasitic causes of diarrhea include \u00afuorescence and EIA for Cryptosporidium; acid-fast stains for Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, culture for Mycobacterium avium complex); and special chromotrope or other stains for microsporidia, as noted in the text. of prevention achieved. The focus of these recommendations is on the industrialized world, in particular the United States,where diagnostic capacities are widespread and the major ep-idemic enteric infections such as cholera and typhoid fever havelong been controlled. For an excellent approach to the diagnosisand management of diarrheal illness in the developing world,the reader is referred to the guidelines published in 1993 bythe World Health Organization [18a]. The magnitude of the problem. Common gastrointestinal illness rates measured in extensive prospective studies con-ducted over the past 50 years range from 1.2 to 1.9 illnessesper person annually in the general population (table 3). Somepopulations in the United States have diarrhea rates (and livingconditions) that approach those seen in developing areas[19\u00b121]. The age-speci\u00aec rates are highest for young children:2.46 illnesses per year per child !3 years old, with a seasonal peak in winter, at which time rotavirus and other enteric virusespredominate, as shown in the Charlottesville, Virginia, familystudy (table 4 and \u00aegure 2) [19]. Attack rates are even higher (5 illnesses per child per year) for children !3 years old who attended child care centers in a study in Arizona [22]. Studiescomparing different types of child care settings have found thatthere is a 2.2- to 3.5-fold greater relative risk of diarrhea amongchildren !3 years of age associated with attendance in child care centers than among children cared for at home (table 5)[22\u00b124]. Illness rates among young children in tropical, de-veloping areas may exceed 6\u00b110 illnesses per child per year.Because these are critical developmental years, there may be alasting impact on physical and cognitive development [14,25\u00b127]. Data from a population survey conducted by random selec- tion from a population of 14.3 million people served by 5Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Food Netsites revealed an average of 1.4 diarrheal episodes per personper year in 1997 (0.75 of these episodes per person per yearwere \u00aadiarrheal illnesses,\u00ba de\u00aened as diarrhea lasting for 11 dayIDSA GUIDELINES xCID 2001:32 (1 February) x335Table 3.

Of the persons affected, an estimated 28 mil-lion (8%) visited a physician's or other provider's million [7%] 45 or provider's of\u00aece; 116 (31%)received (5%) re-ceived an antimicrobial agent. In addition, an estimated 6 mil-lion fecal specimens were submitted from these patients forstool culture and 3 million fecal specimens were submitted forexamination for ova and parasites. Estimates of the number ofdeaths per year associated with diarrhea in the United Statesrange from 500 children [28] to 110,000 persons (of whom 5000 had foodborne infection), with most deaths occurring inthe elderly [8, 29\u00b131]. Lew et al. [32] reviewed 28,538 diarrheal deaths (in ICD-9 codes, diarrhea was listed as the immediate or underlying cause)from National Center for Health Statistics data for a 9-yearperiod (1979\u00b11987). There were an average of 3171 deaths peryear, of which 51% were elderly patients ( 174 years old); 27% were 55\u00b174 years old and 11% were !5 years old [32]. A similar skew, in which 25% of all hospitalizations and 85% of mortalityassociated with diarrhea involved the elderly ( >60 years old), was seen in the McDonnell-Douglas Health Information Systemdatabase reviewed by Gangarosa et al. [30]. It is estimated that,worldwide, there are 3.1 million deaths due to diarrhea peryear ( 18400 per day), mostly of young children in developing areas [3, 5]; thus, annual deaths due to diarrhea globally occurmainly in young children, and the number of deaths is 1000-fold higher than in the United States, where most of those whodie of diarrheal illness are elderly. Inconsistency in evaluation of acute diarrheal illnesses. One goal of a clinical guideline is to summarize concisely the bestavailable information for practitioners. Although informationabout diagnosis and management of acute diarrheal diseases isscattered among disease-speci\u00aec articles and textbooks, weknow of no single reference that comprehensively addressesboth clinical and public health issues dealing with managementof diarrheal diseases. A high degree of variability in health careproviders' practices for a given disease has often been cited asevidence of a need for guideline development. In a recent survey of physicians who see patients with di-arrhea, a signi\u00aecant variability in the likelihood of a stool cul- ture request was observed among physicians in different geo-graphic areas and in different specialties, even after patients'clinical characteristics were controlled for [18]. There are var-ious interpretations of what is considered medically indicatedfor evaluating persons with diarrhea. Stool cultures are oftenviewed as tests with a high cost per relative yield [33\u00b137].Because the results of stool culture or examination for ova andparasites are often available only after a delay, and because mostdiarrheal illnesses are self-limited, these tests may provide littleinformation directly relevant to clinical care and seem an un-necessary expense to many clinicians [38]. However, this in-formation may have great public health importance. One notable example of this importance was a 1994 outbreak of illnesses due to Salmonella serotype enteritidis. In this out- break, the results of diagnostic stool cultures for individualpatients had little impact upon clinical management decisions,because supportive care without antibiotics is generally rec-ommended for infections with this organism [39]. However,from one region of Minnesota, clinical laboratories submittedan elevated number of Salmonella isolates to the state public health laboratory, which led to the detection of an ongoing,nationwide outbreak of Salmonella serotype enteritidis infec- tions due to contaminated commercially distributed ice cream.This outbreak ultimately affected 1220,000 people [40]. Re- moval of the contaminated product from the marketplace pre-vented many thousands of additional illnesses. Illnesses in thisoutbreak were widely dispersed over 41 states, and except forthe initial cluster, they were not concentrated in any one dem-336xCID 2001:32 (1 February) xGuerrant et al. Figure 2. Monthly attack rates for acute gastrointestinal illnesses in Charlottesville, Virginia [19] ographic group or geographic area that would have allowed easy recognition of the outbreak. The initial case-control study that determined the source of this outbreak included only 15 matched case-control pairs. Ifthe clinicians who evaluated those ill persons had treated theirillnesses empirically and not ordered stool cultures, then theoutbreak might not have been recognized. Subsequent inves-tigations determined that only 0.3 percent of the cases asso-ciated with this outbreak were culture-con\u00aermed and subse-quently reported to health authorities. This degree ofunderdetection is common and demonstrates the insensitivityof our surveillance system for enteric diseases [41]. Each pos-itive stool culture can be important for public health investi-gators attempting to detect and control outbreaks. Thus, theseguidelines also emphasize the public health value of stool-spec-imen testing and isolation or identi\u00aecation of speci\u00aec pathogensin the decision-making process. IMPACT OF INCONSISTENT TESTING AND TREATMENT The lack of a speci\u00aec diagnosis can hinder appropriate man- agement and treatment of many infections. Although the pa-tient's history and clinical \u00aendings may provide important cluesto likely etiologies, for some pathogens an organism-speci\u00aecdiagnosis is required. A decrease in the proportion of personswith diarrhea who submit stools for testing will likely result ina higher proportion of patients treated empirically and, in somecases, inappropriately. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy canshorten illness and reduce morbidity in some bacterial andparasitic infections and can be life-saving in invasive infections. The emergence of microbe strains that are resistant to many commonly used antimicrobial agents means that treatment fail-ures may become more common and that determinations ofantimicrobial susceptibility may be made more often. Knowl- edge of the local patterns of susceptibility can guide the initialchoice of antibiotic but depends on isolation of pathogens fromrecent clinical specimens. When empirical therapy is under-taken with broad-spectrum antibiotics or when treatment failsbecause of resistance to the antimicrobial used, it may facilitatethe emergence of drug resistance among some bacterial entericpathogens that spread easily from person to person, such asShigella species [42, 43]. Empirical therapy also results in courses of unnecessary antibiotics. In addition, outcomes ofsome bacterial diarrheal illnesses may be worsened by the useof antibiotics. In these situations, an organism-speci\u00aec diagnosis is an im- portant guide for appropriate therapy. For example, the like-lihood of HUS in patients with E. coli O157:H7 infections may be increased when certain antibiotics are used to treat the initialdiarrhea [44\u00b158]. Treatment of salmonellosis with antibiotics(including quinolones) can prolong the carrier state [59] andlead to a higher clinical relapse rate [60]. In addition to its impact on the infection itself, antimicrobial therapy can increase susceptibility to other infections, such asinfection with a resistant Salmonella species, because of selective pressure that converts silent carriage into overt infection andsymptomatic illness [61, 62]. Recent antimicrobial use is anestablished risk factor for subsequent infection with a suscep-tible Salmonella species, perhaps because of changes induced in native \u00afora [63]. Use of metronidazole or vancomycin forpossible C. dif\u00aecile diarrhea in hospitals is also a major factor in enhancing colonization with and spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci [64, 65]. Organism-speci\u00aec diagnosis of infectious diarrheal diseases allows clinicians to administer antimicrobial therapy most ju-diciously [63]. Furthermore, negative studies for potential path-ogens also have value. This is especially true with documentedIDSA GUIDELINES xCID 2001:32 (1 February) x337Table 5. Relative risk or odds ratio for diarrhea, by type of child care. ReferenceStudy designStudy datesType of setting Child-care center Child-care home RR or OR 95% CI RR or OR 95% CI [22] Cohort commercial child-care centers vs. small child-care homes. in\u00afammatory diarrhea\u00d0for example, when a diagnosis of in- \u00afammatory bowel diseases is greatly aided by a thorough mi-crobiological assessment that is negative [66]. Organism-spe-ci\u00aec diagnosis also can prevent unnecessary procedures ortreatments. For example, a diagnosis of E. coli O157:H7, C. jejuni, orEntamoeba histolytica infection in a patient with severe abdominal cramps or bloody stools can prevent unneeded ordangerous colonoscopy, surgery, or corticosteroid treatment forpresumed ulcerative colitis. Lack of suspicion of an infectious etiology can lead to sec- ondary transmission to others, including health care workers.A noteworthy example of this occurred in an outbreak of E. coliO157:H7 in a nursing home, in which several of the staff members became infected [67]. Thus, individual patient caremay be adversely affected if laboratory diagnostics are not usedappropriately in cases of diarrheal diseases. Finally, an organ-ism-speci\u00aec diagnosis allows the clinician and public healthauthorities to provide the appropriate follow-up recommen-dations for patients who are ill with infectious diarrhea. Ex-amples include communicating to ill food-handlers and healthcare workers that they need to stay home from work and needto submit follow-up stool samples after infection with a par-ticular pathogen has been diagnosed, as well as ensuring follow-up to detect HUS in persons with E. coli O157:H7 infections and providing information about preventing the infection fromspreading among family and day-care contacts. Lack of speci\u00aec diagnosis can also impede disease surveil- lance, outbreak detection, and other critical measures that pro-tect the public health. Identi\u00aecation of a case of E. coli O157 in a child attending a day-care center or of shigellosis in aperson working in a restaurant is critical to protecting othersto whom the infection might spread, both through direct clin-ical advice and management and by prompt noti\u00aecation ofpublic health authorities and subsequent public health actions.This loss of public health surveillance data used to detect andcontrol outbreaks can be minimized by appropriate laboratorytesting of persons with diarrhea. The nature of foodborne diseases in this country is changing; the increasing trend toward mass-produced, minimally proc-essed, and widely distributed foods has been accompanied bymore nationwide and international outbreaks of foodborne di- arrheal diseases [40, 68, 69]. Outbreaks from low-level con-tamination of foods can affect thousands of people over a widegeographic distribution but may not exhibit the classic temporaland geographic clustering seen in point-source outbreaks, suchas those arising from a shared meal [70]. The detection ofoutbreaks that involve widely separated human cases and theresultant control effects are critically dependent on reliable sur-veillance data, including serotyping and molecular subtypingof isolates; a decrease in stool culturing or reporting wouldhave serious negative consequences for public health and safety[70]. In addition, new and emerging diarrheal pathogens arelikely to be detected \u00aerst among outbreak-associated cases, anddecreased rates of diagnostic testing of ill persons could seri-ously hamper our ability to detect such pathogens. For example,monitoring of the antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolates submitted to health departments has led to detection and char-acterization of an emerging pathogen, multidrug-resistant Sal- monella typhimurium DT 104 [71]. YIELD AND COST EFFECTIVENESS OF STOOL CULTURE Although stool cultures are commonly requested, their use- fulness has been questioned [33, 72\u00b178] and the yield of suchcultures is often thought to be quite low. In 1997, the Food-borne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) sur-veyed the 264 clinical laboratories in the \u00aeve FoodNet sites thatcollected incidence data in 1996. The laboratories reported pro-cessing 233,212 stools tested for Salmonella and Shigella ; these reported 2,069 Salmonella isolations and 1272 Shi- gella 0.6% for Shigella for Cam- pylobacter and E. coli O157 give crude yield estimates of 1.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Other reports [18, 33, 35, 76, 77, 79]noted culture yields from 1.5% to 2.9% (\u00aegure 3; although a study at the Puget Sound Health MaintenanceOrganization from May 1985 through April 1986 showed that5.8% of stool specimens submitted were positive for entericpathogens [80].338xCID 2001:32 (1 February) xGuerrant et al. Figure 3. Rates of enteric infection revealed in the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) survey, 1998 [18] Similarly, a report by Slutsker et al. [79, 81] noted a yield of 5.6% from 10 United States hospital laboratories culturingall stools for STEC O157 (table 7). C. jejuni was typically the most common organism detected, followed by Salmonella, Shi- gella, and STEC. Of 30,463 specimens submitted to laboratories in the 10 United States hospitals, of specimens that yieldedSTEC O157, 63% had gross blood and 91% were from patientswith a history of bloody diarrhea; such specimens tended tobe from patients with less severe fever but more abdominalpain than specimens that yielded Campylobacter, Salmonella, or Shigella species (table 7) [79]. If one calculates from the yield and price of stool cultures a cost per positive result, as initially done by Koplan et al. in1980 [33], the cost can be US$952 to $1200 [33\u00b135]. Thisimpressive cost derives from (1) the relative insensitivity of thetest for the most likely pathogens and (2) the poor selectionof specimens being cultured for what can be sought [34, 35]. Although the costs associated with testing are an important consideration, the cost per positive stool culture is an incom-plete and misleading measure of the value of diagnostic testing.Because diagnostic stool testing is a method of obtaining in-formation for both individual patient care and public healthpurposes, better predictive factors for ordering tests should alsobe used. APPROACHES TO IMPROVING THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF STOOL CULTURE Selective testing. Selective testing can improve the yield and usefulness of stool testing. For example, the CDC has rec-ommended that E. coli O157 be considered for all persons with acute bloody diarrhea or HUS and that stool specimens shouldbe speci\u00aecally tested for this organism [79, 83]. Because nospeci\u00aec media have been developed to detect non-O157 speciesof STEC, testing for these organisms is more dif\u00aecult, and toxintesting of stool or culture supernatants can be used for patients with severe bloody diarrhea or HUS from whom a pathogenhas not been isolated [84]. In cases of bloody diarrhea or HUS,testing stool samples after broth enrichment with an EIA kitfor Shiga toxin is an excellent way to detect STEC [46]. Whenthis test is positive, it is very important for public health pur-poses to con\u00aerm the serotype of the STEC. This can be doneby testing on sorbitol-MacConkey (SMAC) agar (to detect E. coli O157) or by sending E. coli isolates to the state public health laboratory for testing. Other examples of selective testingof diarrheal stools that could be adopted include performingcultures for Vibrio on thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts (TCBS) me- dium who have ingested shell\u00aesh within the 3 daysbefore illness began and performing cultures for Yersinia en- terocolitica in fall or winter for certain at-risk populations (e.g., Asian-Americans in California and African-American infants)[85]. The \u00aa3-day rule\u00ba for hospitalized patients. One approach to reducing testing on specimens that have a very low yield hasbeen the \u00aa3-day rule\u00ba [43, 73\u00b175]. Fecal specimens from pa-tients with diarrhea that develops after 3 days of hospitalizationhave a very low yield when cultured for standard bacterialpathogens ( Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, etc.) or ex- amined for ova and parasites. On the basis of this \u00aending,several groups have suggested that unless overriding circum-stances prevail, fecal specimens from patients hospitalized for 13 days should not be submitted for routine stool culture. These specimens account for 15%\u00b150% of all specimens submitted,and it has been estimated that implementing this rule wouldhave saved $20\u00b1$73 million in the United States in 1996 [43,74, 77]. Likewise, multiple stool examinations for ova and par-asites are of low yield (especially for hospitalized patients withnosocomial diarrhea) [75]. Of course, appropriate culturesshould be performed for any patient admitted for diarrhealillness, irrespective of the date of hospital admission, if theIDSA GUIDELINES xCID 2001:32 (1 February) x339Table 6.

A multicenter study from Europe suggests that age >65 years, comorbid disease, neutropenia and HIV infection may warrant cultures despite onset >3 d after hospitalization [76]. Conversely, specimens from patients who have been in the hospital for >3 days may yield C. dif\u00aecile in 15%\u00b120% of cases, suggesting that patients developing diarrhea in the hospital (orwho have taken antimicrobial agents recently) should havespecimens tested for C. dif\u00aecile toxin(s); this pertains especially to patients who are severely ill or who have in\u00afammatorydiarrhea. Screening for in\u00afammatory diarrhea. In addition to the above approach of limiting specimens processed in the labo-ratory, several groups have suggested that it is more useful toscreen for the relative minority of diarrheal illnesses that arein\u00afammatory or invasive [29, 86, 87], since these are the mostlikely to be caused by the invasive pathogens for which culture(Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia) or toxin testing C. dif\u00aecile ) is usually available. An in\u00afammatory etiology can be suspected on the basis of fever, tenesmus, orbloody stools and can be con\u00aermed by microscopic exami-nation for fecal polymorphonuclear leukocytes for marker lactoferrin echLab). The disadvantages of microscopy are that the yieldis best with fresh-cup specimens and that specimens must beexamined by an experienced microscopist [88]. Some studies,however, suggest that testing for fecal lactoferrin may be moresensitive [43, 78, 89]. Disadvantages of lactoferrin testing in-clude its cost ($3.75 per test, for kit) and its false-positive resultsfor breast-fed infants. Evidence of an in\u00afammatory responseis often not present in noninvasive toxin-mediated infections such as those due to STEC or enterotoxic E. coli. Use of more re\u00aened diagnostic algorithms and screening tests is an area in need of active research; improved algorithms area potential source of cost-savings without sacri\u00aece of diagnosticspeci\u00aecity. For example, several studies suggest that when fecalspecimens are screened for evidence of an in\u00afammatory pro-cess, the yield of culture for invasive pathogens can be increasedsubstantially [34, 35, 78]. RECOMMENDATIONS As suggested by the above approaches, a rational synthesis can be offered that is appropriate for the optimal care of theindividual patient and for the needs of the community. These recommendations are consistent with and update published prac-tice guidelines in the pediatric [36, 90], gastroenterology [29],and clinical laboratory literature. We have divided the recom-mendations into 2 sections, which give separate recommenda-tions for clinical practice and for public health management. The complete public-health management of the variety of diarrheal illnesses is beyond the scope of these guidelines andhave been well-summarized for each infection [91]. The fol-lowing general principles de\u00aene the need for speci\u00aec fecal test-ing, pathogen isolation, and patient intervention for optimalclinical care and to protect the public health. Clinical Recommendations Initial rehydration. The most common risks with diar- rheal illnesses are dehydration and, in developing countries,malnutrition. Thus, the critical initial treatment must includerehydration, which can be accomplished with an oral glucose340xCID 2001:32 (1 February) xGuerrant et al.Table 7.

Although many patients with mild diarrhea canprevent dehydration by ingesting extra \u00afuids (such as clearjuices and soups), more severe diarrhea, postural light-head-edness, and reduced urination signify the need for more re-hydration \u00afuids. Oral rehydration solutions approaching theWHO-recommended electrolyte concentrations (e.g., Ceralyte,Pedialyte, or generic solutions) can be purchased at local phar-macies or obtained from pediatricians. WHO-recommendedoral rehydration solutions can also be prepared by a pharmacyby mixing 3.5 g of NaCl, 2.5 g of NaHCO 3(or 2.9 g of Na citrate), 1.5 g of KCl, and 20 g of glucose or glucose polymer(e.g., 40 g of sucrose or 4 tablespoons of sugar or 50\u00b160 g ofcooked cereal \u00afour such as rice, maize, sorghum, millet, wheat,or potato) per liter (1.05 qt) of clean water. This makes asolution of approximately Na 90 m M,K2 0m M,Cl 80 m M, HCO 330 m M,and glucose 111 m M. The evidence supporting this recommendation for all pa- tients with dehydrating diarrhea is well documented [92\u00b194].Because oral rehydration therapy has been shown to be widelyapplicable throughout the world, it was hailed in 1978 as \u00aapo-tentially the most important medical advance of this century\u00ba[95]. Administration of this solution is not only lifesaving incases of severe diarrhea in settings where iv \u00afuids are dif\u00aecultto administer but is also less painful, safer, less costly, andsuperior to administration of iv \u00afuids for persons who are ableto take oral \u00afuids. The patient's thirst decreases as he or sheis rehydrated, which helps protect against overhydration [96].Stool output can be further reduced with food-based oral re-hydration therapy [97, 98]. Vitamin A and zinc repletion shouldbe considered for patients with likely or documented de\u00aeciency.Promising new approaches to oral rehydration and nutritiontherapy, incorporating glutamine or its derivatives to furtherhelp mucosal-injury repair, are being developed [99]. Patient evaluation. As recommended in widely used al- gorithms with detailed footnotes and in similar tables publishedelsewhere [78, 87, 100], obtaining a thorough history, includingboth clinical and epidemiological features, should be the \u00aerststep in evaluating a patient who presents with any signi\u00aecant diarrheal illness (i.e., profuse, dehydrating, febrile, or bloodydiarrhea, especially in infants and elderly or immunocom-promised patients; \u00aegure 1) (A-II). Relevant clinical featuresinclude: (1) when and how the illness began (e.g., abrupt orgradual onset and duration of symptoms); mucous, purulent, greasy, of bowel movements and relative quantity of stoolproduced; (4) presence of dysenteric symptoms (fever, tenes-mus, blood and/or pus in the stool); (5) symptoms of volumedepletion (thirst, tachycardia, orthostasis, decreased urination,lethargy, decreased skin turgor); and (6) associated symptomsand their frequency and intensity (nausea, vomiting, abdominalpain, cramps, headache, myalgias, altered sensorium). In addition, all patients should be asked about potential ep- idemiological risk factors for particular diarrheal diseases orfor their spread. These include the following: (1) travel to adeveloping area; (2) day-care center attendance or employment;(3) consumption of unsafe foods (e.g., raw meats, eggs, orshell\u00aesh; unpasteurized milk or juices) or swimming in ordrinking untreated fresh surface water from, for example, a lakeor stream; (4) visiting a farm or petting zoo or having contactwith reptiles or with pets with diarrhea; (5) knowledge of otherill persons (such as in a dormitory or of\u00aece or a social function);(6) recent or regular medications (antibiotics, antacids, anti-motility agents); (7) underlying medical conditions predispos-ing to infectious diarrhea (AIDS, immunosuppressive medi-cations, prior gastrectomy, extremes of age); and (whereappropriate) (8) receptive anal intercourse or oral-anal sexualcontact and (9) occupation as a food-handler or caregiver. Forpersons with AIDS, a modi\u00aeed algorithm has been publishedwith recommendations for initial diagnosis and therapy as wellas more invasive evaluation [100]. Diarrhea continues to be animportant problem for patients with AIDS, even in the era ofhighly active antiretroviral therapy [101, 102]. A directed physical examination may also give clues as to the appropriate evaluation and treatment of an acute diarrhealillness. It is particularly important to observe for abnormal vitalIDSA GUIDELINES xCID 2001:32 (1 February) x341signs (including fever, orthostatic pulse, and blood pressure changes), other signs of volume depletion (dry mucous mem-branes, decreased skin turgor, absent jugular venous pulsa-tions), abdominal tenderness, and altered sensorium. The predominant clinical features associated with the most common infectious diarrheal illnesses are given in table 8. Withfew exceptions, the predictive value of any of the features listedis relatively low for any particular enteric pathogen [80, 82].However, some of the diseases cul-ture (shigellosis, salmonellosis, and campylobacteriosis) sharecertain in\u00afammatory features such as fever, abdominal pain, bloody stools, and the presence in stools of leukocytes, fecallactoferrin, and/or occult blood (II) [78, 103\u00b1113]. Fecal testing. Developing better algorithms combining clinical and epidemiological features is an area for future re-search. For example, any diarrheal illness lasting 11 day, es- pecially if accompanied by fever, bloody stools, systemic illness,recent use of antibiotics, day-care center attendance, hospital-ization, or dehydration (de\u00aened as dry mucous membranes,decreased urination, tachycardia, symptoms or signs of posturalhypotension, or lethargy or obtundation), should prompt eval-uation of a fecal specimen, as noted below and in \u00aegure 1.Additional diagnostic evaluations, such as serum chemistryanalysis, complete blood count, blood cultures, urinalysis,abdominal radiography, anoscopy, and \u00afexible endoscopy maybe considered for selected cases in which disease severity orclinical and epidemiological features suggest the need for suchtesting. We recommend a selective approach to fecal studies, such as that shown in \u00aegure 1. The enteric illness is pro\u00aeled to placeit in >1 categories, and for each of these tests are suggested. The categories include community-acquired or traveler's di-arrhea, especially if accompanied by fever or blood in the stool;nosocomial diarrhea that occurs 3 days after the start of hos-pitalization; and persistent diarrhea (B-II). Although the presence of fecal leukocytes or lactoferrin fur- ther suggests an in\u00afammatory diarrhea illness, such as thoselisted in panels A and B, experts differ regarding the routineuse of screens for in\u00afammatory infection for the initial testingof patients with community or nosocomial diarrhea (\u00aegure 1Aand 1 B). However, a positive screen for patients with unex- plained persistent or recurrent diarrhea suggests that consid-eration should be given to a diagnosis of possible in\u00afammatorybowel disease (i.e., ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) andthat a gastroenterologist should be consulted [66]. Patients in-fected with STEC often have bloody diarrhea and negative orlow levels of lactoferrin, indicating the need for a specializedapproach for such patients [114] (R. L. Guerrant, C. Park, T.S. Steiner, et al., unpublished observation). Hospitalized patients (except, as noted above, those patients admitted for a diarrheal illness whose initial workup was in-complete or those patients whose diarrhea is suspected to be nosocomial in origin), especially those with abdominal pain,should be tested for C. dif\u00aecile toxin. Any illness that persists for 17 days (especially in an immunocompromised patient) should prompt further testing of fecal specimens, as indicatedin panel C in \u00aegure 1. In suspected outbreaks of gastroenteritis,special studies of stool specimens and E. coli isolates may be needed [115]. New methods that involve the use of EIA andDNA probe nonculture techniques are rapidly being developedand hold great promise for improved sensitivity. Routine per-formance of cultures, the traditional \u00aagold standard,\u00ba will re- main critical for antibiotic resistance testing and for serotypedetermination and subtyping in outbreaks. Rotavirus infection,a leading cause of diarrhea in young children (especially inwinter months in temperate climates) can be diagnosed withcommercial assays, and Norwalk-like virus infections can bediagnosed with research assays, but these tests are usually notnecessary for managing an individual case. Noninfectious or extraintestinal causes of diarrhea should be considered when the compendium of diagnostic evaluationhas not identi\u00aeed a pathogen. These causes include irritablebowel syndrome, in\u00afammatory bowel disease (if recurring orpersistent, with fecal leukocytes or lactoferrin, and unexplai-ned), ischemic bowel disease (if the patient is 150 years old or has peripheral vascular disease), laxative abuse, partial obstruc-tion, Because of increasing threats from antimicrobial-resistant infections, side effects of treatmentwith antimicrobial agents, suprainfections when normal \u00aforaare eradicated by antimicrobial agents, and the possibility ofinduction of disease-producing phage by (such [47], anyconsideration of antimicrobial therapy must be carefullyweighed against unintended and potentially harmful conse-quences. New nonantimicrobial treatments to block secretoryor in\u00afammatory toxins or to enhance electrolyte absorptionand intestinal repair are badly needed and are under study. One situation in which empirical antibiotics are commonly recommended without obtaining a fecal specimen is in casesof traveler's diarrhea, in which enterotoxigenic E. coli or other bacterial pathogens are likely causes, and prompt treatmentwith \u00afuoroquinolone or, in children, trimethoprim-sulfame-thoxazole (TMP-SMZ) can reduce the duration of an illnessfrom 3\u00b15 days to !1\u00b12 days (A-I). Some also consider empirical treatment of diarrhea that lasts longer than 10\u00b114 days forsuspected giardiasis, if other evaluations are negative and, es-pecially, if the patient's history of travel or water exposure issuggestive [29]. Otherwise, for patients with febrile diarrhealillnesses, especially those believed to have moderate to severeTable 8. Clinical features and physical and laboratory \u00aendings for common infectious diarrheal illnesses. Feature or \u00aendingaPatients infected with indicated pathogen, of patients with >3 days of diarrhea and fever, vomiting, myalgias or headache had stool cultures with associated with weight loss (75% and 91% of cases, respectively), andCyclospora is associated with striking fatigue in up to 92% of cases [210]. dAlso a prominent feature of sexually transmitted proctitis. eCombined patients infected xCID 2001:32 (1 February) x343invasive disease, empirical treatment should be considered (af- ter a fecal specimen is obtained for the performance of thestudies noted above). This empirical treatment can be with anagent such as a quinolone antibiotic or, for children, TMP-SMZ, which can reduce the duration and shedding of organismsin infections with susceptible Shigella species (A-I) [117\u00b1121] and spe- cies (B-II) [122, 123]. However, Campylobacter infections ( <10.2% in Minne- sota such infections may possibly be worsened by quinolone eradication of competing normal \u00afora [124\u00b1126].Quinolone resistance that develops during treatment and isaccompanied by symptomatic relapse has been described withregard to Campylobacter [127\u00b1129]. Erythromycin may reduce the duration of illness and shedding of susceptible C. jejuni , particularly when given early in the illness [130, 131]. Sal-monella infections may warrant quinolone or other antimicro-bial therapy when systemic spread is considered a risk or sus-pected and for children !6 months of age; however, like other antibiotics, quinolones may prolong shedding of non- typhi spe- cies of Salmonella [29, 59, 60, 132]. A particularly worrisome development is the appearance of multiple-drug resistance, including resistance to quinolones, inclinical Salmonella strains [133]. Antibiotics should not be pre- scribed simply to reduce the likelihood of secondary trans-mission. Other interventions, such as hand-washing, canachieve the same ends without introducing the risk of selectingfor resistance [134]. Suspected or documented STEC infections should not be treated with antimotility agents (E-II) [54, 80, 135\u00b1139], anda decision to treat an illness that could be due to STEC O157with an antimicrobial agent should be considered carefully, asit may worsen the risk of HUS developing. Treatment of STECO157 infections with antimicrobial agents has not been shownto ameliorate illness, and several retrospective studies havenoted a higher rate of HUS in treated patients [44\u00b158], whichcould be an effect of treatment or a re\u00afection of more aggressivetreatment of patients who are more ill. In vitro data indicatethat certain antimicrobial agents can increase the productionof Shiga toxin, and animal studies have demonstrated harmfuleffects of antibiotic treatment of STEC infections [47, 140]. InJapan, both nonrandomized studies of that fosfomycin, a non\u00b1 b-lactam cell wall\u00b1synthesis inhibitor (licensed only for urinary tract infec-tions in the United States), may be safe and possibly improvethe clinical course [58], but further study is needed (C-III) [44,46, 47, 58, 59]. Details of diagnosis and treatment of speci\u00aec infections are summarized in table 9 [29, 100, 141]. Because of changingpatterns of antimicrobial resistance, recent local patterns arecritical to making decisions about antimicrobial therapy [52, 54\u00b156, 67, 136, 142\u00b1191]. An increasing amount of information suggests that Aero- monas is an enteric pathogen in the healthy host; it is usually associated with mild, though sometimes chronic and sometimesbloody, diarrhea. TMP-SMZ is the agent of choice if antimi-crobial therapy is deemed necessary. The data supporting thepathogenicity of Plesiomonas are somewhat weaker; laboratory evidence of its pathogenicity is quite thin. However, particularlyin the setting of a diarrheal illness following travel or shell\u00aeshconsumption, if other pathogens have not been isolated it couldbe considered in the differential diagnosis. Anecdotal reportssuggest that TMP-SMZ might diminish the duration ofsymptoms. Table 2 summarizes the major recommendations detailed in these guidelines. Initial rehydration, clinical and epidemiolog-ical evaluation, and selecting appropriate fecal studies and ther-apy are key to optimal diagnosis and management, and re-porting suspected outbreaks and cases of noti\u00aeable illnesses tolocal health authorities is vital in order to allow measures tobe taken to investigate threats of enteric infection arising fromour increasingly global and industrialized food supplies. Par-enteral (Vi) or oral (Ty21a) typhoid vaccines are recommendedfor travelers to areas where typhoid is endemic who are at highrisk for infection because they are not staying at the usual touristhotels; new live and killed oral cholera vaccines are becomingavailable outside the United States [192\u00b1194]. Public Health Recommendations Diagnostic fecal testing for public health reasons. Diag- nostic testing of stool specimens is indicated for certain groupsof people who are not themselves patients. Food-handlers infood service establishments and health care workers involvedin direct patient care should be tested for bacterial pathogensif they have diarrhea because of their potential to transmitinfection to large numbers of persons. Similarly, diarrheal ill-ness in a day-care attendee, day-care employee, or resident ofan institutional facility (e.g., psychiatric hospital, prison, ornursing home) should be evaluated for bacterial or parasiticinfection because gastrointestinal illnesses in these settings mayindicate that a disease outbreak is occurring. Physicians whosuspect a disease outbreak is occurring because they have ob-served an increased incidence of diarrheal disease among aparticular group should request the types of diagnostic testingappropriate to the clinical illness in order to facilitate identi-\u00aecation of the etiologic agent and to de\u00aene the extent of theoutbreak. The suspected outbreak should also be reported topublic health authorities. Disease reporting. The reporting of speci\u00aec infectious dis- eases to the appropriate public health authorities is the cor-nerstone of public-health surveillance, outbreak detection, andTable 9.

Clinicians and clinical labora- tories have a central role in this process. Although reportingrequirements and procedures differ by jurisdictions, in mostcommunities reporting begins when a noti\u00aeable infection isdiagnosed and reported to the local or state health department.Requirements for the reporting of disease can be obtained fromthe state or local health department or at the Web site of theCouncil of State and T erritorial Epidemiologists: http://www.cste.org. If an outbreak is suspected, early reporting can lead to prompt investigations that may result in source detection and,ultimately, prevention of additional illnesses. Local health de-partments can counsel individual patients, conduct outbreakinvestigations, assist in contact noti\u00aecation, and provide follow-up for patients involved in disease outbreaks. Health depart-ments can also provide information on disease prevention tothe general public or persons at increased risk for diarrhealdiseases, and they are usually best suited for handling inquiriesfrom print and electronic media. Isolate subtyping. For several enteric bacterial organisms, public-health surveillance depends on subtyping the clinicalisolates in the state public health laboratory to detect and in-vestigate outbreaks and to de\u00aene the success of control mea-sures. Salmonella isolates are routinely serotyped. Beginning in 1997, state public health laboratories also began performingstandardized pulsed-\u00aeeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) on isolatesof STEC O157 and comparing the patterns they identi\u00aeed witha national database maintained at the CDC. PulseNet, as thisnational network for molecular subtyping is called, has sincebeen expanded to include serotyping of isolates of Salmonella, Shigella, and Listeria, and it has been critical to the detection, early termination, and even prevention of outbreaks of food-borne illness [195]. Molecular subtyping strategies are beingdeveloped for viral pathogens, such as hepatitis A and calici-viruses, and may be available for routine public health practicein the future. Follow-up testing. In certain situations, assurance should be obtained that a patient with a laboratory-con\u00aermed bacterialor parasitic diarrheal disease has been cured or is no longer a fecal carrier. Because food-handlers and health care workerscan transmit bacterial and parasitic diseases even if they areasymptomatic, it is recommended that before returning to theirjobs these persons have 2 consecutive negative stool samplestaken 24 h apart and at least 48 h after resolution of symptoms.If the patient has received antimicrobial therapy, the \u00aerst stoolspecimen should be obtained at least 48 h after the last dose[196]. Furthermore, if food-handlers or health care workers aresymptomatic, they should be excluded from directly handlingfood and from caring for high-risk patients. Regulations vary by jurisdiction and by pathogen, so pro- viders should contact their local public health of\u00aece beforeadvising persons in these job categories. Public health of\u00aecialsmay be able to assist by obtaining follow-up samples and pro-viding patient education. Diarrheal illnesses in day-care atten-dees and employees should be managed carefully because ofthe high likelihood of person-to-person spread of commonpathogens, such as E. coli O157:H7 and Shigella sonnei. Ap- proaches to prevention and control of diarrheal disease in day-care settings have included requiring that ill children stay home,cohorting of convalescent children within the center, and ed-ucation of the community [197\u00b1201]. Cooperation between thephysicians who detect diarrheal illnesses among day-care con-tacts and the local public health personnel is critically importantfor identifying potential outbreaks and implementing effectivecontrol methods. Preventing illnesses through patient education. Many di- arrheal diseases can be prevented by following simple rules ofpersonal hygiene and safe food preparation. Hand-washing withsoap is an effective step in preventing spread of illness andshould be emphasized for caregivers of persons with diarrhealillnesses. As noted above, human feces must always be consid-ered potentially hazardous, whether or not diarrhea or potentialpathogens have been identi\u00aeed. Consequently, microbial studiesshould not be needed to justify careful attention to hygiene. Select populations may require additional education about food safety, and health care providers can play an important346xCID 2001:32 (1 February) xGuerrant et al.role in providing this information. Immunocompromised per- sons (e.g., HIV-infected patients, cancer chemotherapy recip-ients, and persons receiving long-term oral steroids or im-munosuppressive agents) are more susceptible to infection witha variety of enteric pathogens and often are more likely todevelop illness of greater severity and more frequently accom-panied by complications. Such persons can reduce their riskby learning and following safe food-handling and preparationpractices [202]. Alcoholics and persons with chronic liver disease (hema- chromatosis or cirrhosis) are at increased risk for infectionsdue to Vibrio vulni\u00aecus from raw shell\u00aesh and should avoid them. Persons with impaired immune defenses are at increasedrisk for infection with Listeria monocytogenes from soft cheeses, unheated deli meats, and raw dairy products, and thereforethey should avoid these foods. Pregnant women should avoidundercooked meats because of the risk of infection with Tox- oplasma gondii and (like all persons) should avoid raw dairy products (e.g., unpasteurized milk or cheeses), soft French-stylecheeses, and unheated deli meats, which carry an increased riskofListeria monocytogenes infection; both organisms are asso- ciated with miscarriage. Among young children and the elderly, illness caused by infection with Salmonella orE. coli can be particularly devas- tating but is potentially preventable by following safe food prac-tices. General educational information on food safety is avail- able from a number of sources, including many foodborneinfections_g.htm; http://www.\u00aeghtbac.org; http://www.foodsafety.gov; http://www.health\u00aender.gov; and http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodborne/foodborn.htm. Although vaccines are not the focus of these management guidelines, currently available vaccines for typhoid fever in theUnited States are the (often toxic) heat-phenol-inactivated par-enteral vaccine. Since typhoid fever in the United States inrecent years has often been imported (i.e., usually acquiredduring international travel) and is potentially severe and largelypreventable, we recommend the Vi or Ty21a (or, only for chil-dren !2 years old, the heat-phenol-inactivated) vaccine for those with signi\u00aecant likely exposure [194] (B-II [203]). With regard to cholera vaccines, only the old parenteral vac- cine is licensed for use in the United States at the time of thiswriting, and it is not recommended because of the extremelylow risk of cholera to the traveler and the limited ef\u00aecacy ofthe vaccine [193]. New oral live (CVD 103HgR) and killed(whole-cell B-subunit) vaccines are licensed outside the UnitedStates and are used by some travelers. The rotavirus vaccine,although effective, has presented complications in the form ofrare cases of intussusception; it is no longer marketed and thus is not recommended. References 1.
