The potential for these vaccines to efficiently treat a wide range of communicable diseases is enormous, and the technology is poised to explode into the marketplace. However, effective mRNA vaccines are only as good as the materials and methodologies used to create them, as well as the analytical steps used to test their potency, stability, and clinical efficacy. Traditional analytical methods are slow and end up wasting investigators' time and money. Advanced imaging and analysis platforms may hold the key to simplifying vaccine development and manufacturing bottlenecks, as they are fast and can be multiplexed to answer multiple scientific questions per analysis. In this GEN webinar, our distinguished speaker Dr. Kathy Rowlen, CEO and co-founder of InDevR, will describe how the company is expanding its standardized multiplexed potency test platform beyond protein-based vaccines into mRNA applications. Dr. Rowlen will also review critical quality attributes for mRNA vaccines, related CMC issues and explain how the VaxArray platform can streamline development and testing for multivalent drug products. A live Q&A session followed the presentation, offering a chance to pose questions to our expert panelist. Produced "}
