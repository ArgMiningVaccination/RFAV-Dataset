This programme has been really insightful and has helped to reinforce my love of medicine.\" - Year 13 participant \"I have become a much more well-rounded, confident individual thanks to this programme and it has played a pivotal role in my (hopefully) imminent entry to medicine.\" - Year 13 participant \"I was part of Pathways last year and now I'm a first-year medical student at Imperial! The programme helped me so much with my medical school application and getting into Imperial, so I am always really grateful for the programme.\" - Programme alumni \"Being part of Imperial's Pathways to Medicine has given me access to consistent and reliable information that I would otherwise never have, which I am forever grateful for. I've gained a realistic insight into all the marvellous pathways that can lead to medicine and that medicine can lead into, and have learnt how to look at medical cases and news through the lens of a medical student. The mentors and various doctors who dedicated time out of their busy schedules to help make medicine a more accessible course to the widening participation population made me truly appreciate the support that comes from the medical community and excited to be a part of it in the future. Thank you for the endless stream of support and memories and for being the beginning of our exposure to the mind framework of medical students and doctors that we will look back on as doctors ourselves.\" - Year 13 participant Further reading Learn about the beginning of the programme from news article [Pathways to medicine: one year on](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/167033/pathways-medicine-year/) Hear from a current participant and an alumni who both spoke to 'Imperial Stories' for [On the right track](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/Stories/on-the-right-track/) Get to know one of our regular contributers, Consultant Gastroenterologist [Professor Shahid Khan](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/study/undergraduate/medicine-mbbs-programmes/mbbs-offerholder/role-models/) Applicant information Eligibility criteria We recommend that you use our [eligibility checker tool](https://imperial.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_d58HUBmcZlwENMN) to see if you are eligible to apply.
