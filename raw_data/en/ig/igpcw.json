In the fall of this year, the Department of Ophthalmology & Vision Science will inaugurate the first of four new Endowed Chairs. The investiture of an endowed chair is a great moment for our faculty and for the patients for whom we care. By way of explanation, a gift of $2M establishes an endowment. The chair holder can use the interest that spins off the endowment principal to invest in meaningful academic pursuits above and beyond the delivery of patient care. As such, an endowed chair is the catalyst for new discoveries in medicine. The chair bears the name of the donor in perpetuity, and when the career of the chair holder comes to an end, a new chair holder carries on the legacy. It is, therefore, a gift that truly keeps on giving and is a permanent legacy for discovery and innovation. In September, we celebrated the formal investiture of the Neil and MJ Kelly Presidential Chair in Vitreoretinal Science. Neil and MJ Kelly had the generosity and foresight to establish this chair, which will no doubt contribute significantly to treatments for devastating retinal diseases. This endowed chair will be held by Professor Paul Sieving, former director of the National Eye Institute and now a senior member of our department. Dr. Sieving is the lead in the development of the Center for Ocular Regenerative Therapy (CORT), which will occupy a central place in the new Tschannen Eye Institute Building. Dr. Sieving and his collaborators will focus on the development of gene therapy for a range of inherited retinal disorders. In November, we celebrated the formal investiture of the Barbara A. and Alan M. Roth, M.D., Endowed Chair for Discovery, Education and Patient Care in Vision Science. Emeritus faculty member Dr. Alan Roth, sees this $2M investment as a roadmap and key to creative work that will better the lives of many patients through investigative science and education. In November, we conferred the named Chair upon Susanna Park, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Retina Service in our department. Dr. Park's innovative research employs stem cells for the treatment of retinal vascular diseases as well as macular degenerative disorders.Currently, the search is underway for two additional chairs: one in clinical glaucoma and one in glaucoma research. Through the generosity of grateful patient Daryl Geweke, these chairs will serve to advance the science and treatment of glaucoma, the cause of so much vision loss in our population. This gift will no doubt advance the science needed to understand and treat this disease. We are witnessing the construction of the new eye institute. As wonderful as that is, what counts even more is the programming and science that is housed in this wonderful new building. The endowment of a chair or professorship ensures the future of our academic pursuits to the ultimate benefit of our patients by allowing for the recruitment and retention of outstanding faculty. We thank those who have made an investment in vision science and whose names will be carried forward in perpetuity to symbolize their dedication to advancement in vision care.Eye to Eye Executive Advisory Council 2021-2022 Council Members Council Chair DAVID MOTES, C.P.A.

Fosse Endowed Chair in Vision Science Research Professor and Chair Department of Ophthalmology & Vision Science University of California, Davis Eye Center VISION SCIENCE AT UC DAVIS From glaucoma discoveries that hold clues about Alzheimer's disease to stem cell therapies that reverse blinding eye diseases, every day, UC Davis Eye Center researchers and specialists are expanding the horizons of what vision science can do for patients. Our partnerships across fields, including our extraordinary collaboration with colleagues at the world's best veterinary school, position us to accelerate groundbreaking science, leading-edge therapies and, ultimately, cures. ADOLPH COORS FOUNDATION PROVIDES MULTI-YEAR RESEARCH GRANT The UC Davis Eye Center received a $310,640 award from the Adolph Coors Foundation supporting a three-year study to determine the effects of noninvasive electroacupuncture on T-cell production. The study will rigorously analyze participants' overall health, immune cells, and the biochemical markers associated with immunity. Dr. Min Zhao, Professor, UC Davis Eye Center, and Dr. Fernando Fierro, Associate Professor, UC Davis Department of Cell Biology and Human Anatomy, are leading the project in collaboration with Dr. Don Ha from UCLA. The study addresses immune regulation, which will benefit innumerable medical conditions including infections, cancer, and other diseases where immunity is dysregulated. At this early stage, the researchers are not targeting a particular disease; rather, they aim to establish the efficacy of noninvasive electroacupuncture on immune regulation. Once this is tested and proven, the team expects to work on specific, carefully selected disease targets. \"This unique support gives us a rare opportunity not available from conventional funding mechanisms, accelerating our ability to determine systemic immune responses to electrical stimulation of acupuncture points noninvasively, without needles,\" said Dr. Zhao. \"Our research may lead to a completely new understanding of how our body responds to precisely controlled electric stimulation, and may offer new electroceuticals for immune modulation for the treatment of many important diseases.\" The Adolph Coors Foundation was established in 1975 and has awarded $135.3 million to a variety of causes since its inception. This is the first award the Adolph Coors Foundation has given to the nationally-renowned UC Davis Eye Center. \"Due to a generous gift and the unbelieveable vision of Bill Coors, the Adolph Coors Foundation has sought and funded promising evidence- based integrative medicine practices with the goal of seeing those practices reach the medical mainstream,\" said Carrie Tynan, Executive Director of the Adolph Coors Foundation. \"Our foundation is proud to partner with UC Davis Health on what we believe could be a revolutionary approach to wellness.\" The two-year research project began July 2021 and will conclude in June 2023. PAUL A. SIEVING, M.D., PH.D., INDUCTED AS THE INAUGURAL HOLDER OF THE NEIL AND MJ KELLY PRESIDENTIAL CHAIR IN VITREORETINAL SCIENCE Paul Sieving, M.D., Ph.D., an internationally renowned physician, vision scientist and leader in eye care and research, has been inducted as the inaugural holder of the Neil and MJ Kelly Presidential Chair in Vitreoretinal Science at UC Davis. Among the distinguished speakers at the event was the twenty-first president of the University of California, Michael V. Drake, MD, who is a glaucoma specialist by training. Dr. Sieving joined the UC Davis Eye Center faculty in 2019 as a professor of ophthalmology. He specializes in identifying the genetic causes of blinding inherited diseases of the retina and macula with the goal of bringing gene therapy and cell- based therapies to patients. He is creating a new Center for Ocular Regenerative Therapy (CORT) to provide care for patients with genetically-caused eye disease and to explore the development of gene- and cell-based regenerative therapies. Inherited retinal degeneration conditions currently have no effective treatment. Prior to coming to UC Davis, Dr. Sieving served as the longtime director of the National Eye Institute (NEI) at the National Institutes of Health, where he managed a $700 million budget that supported 550 physicians, researchers, and staff. His signature accomplishment was launching the NEI Audacious Goals Initiative for Regenerative Medicine, a fifteen year research and clinical effort that seeks to restore function of critical nerve cells in the eye and visual system, even after damage from diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. As a senior investigator at the NIH, Dr. Sieving explored new treatments for retinitis pigmentosa, Stargardt disease, and other inherited disorders of the retina and macula. His work led to the first human clinical trial of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) for retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic disorder that causes retinal vision cells to progressively break down and die. Dr. Sieving is also known for working to develop gene therapy treatment for X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), a form of retinal degeneration that causes central vision loss in children and young adults. His lab developed a mouse model for XLRS and then successfully used gene supplementation to rectify the condition. The treatment is now in human clinical trials. Neil Kelly, MD, and MJ Kelly established the Neil and MJ Kelly Presidential Chair in Vitreoretinal Science in 2017. Neil was the first resident to graduate from the UC Davis Department of Ophthalmology & Vision Science. He served for fifteen years on the department's volunteer clinical faculty and helped to train and educate its residents. Neil, who was the first fellowship- trained retina specialist in Sacramento, established the Retinal Consultants Medical Group in 1975. As the acknowledged inventor of macular hole surgery, he changed the lives of countless patients suffering from macular disease. Before this discovery, patients with macular holes were considered legally blind. In addition, Neil is one of two physicians to pioneer the use of pneumatic retinopexy as a treatment for retinal detachment, now a standard tool in vitreoretinal surgical repair options. MJ trained and worked as a nurse for many years and is very active in Sacramento garden clubs, floral design, and Toastmasters. Neil retired from practice in 2003.

In addition to the endowed chair, Dr. Roth established the Alan and Barbara Roth Ophthalmic Pathology Laboratory in the new UC Davis Eye Center facility. Dr. Roth devotes his time to enjoying music, watching Giants baseball games, and and traveling. 2021 J. WILLIAM KOHL, M.D. SUMMER SCHOLARS Thanks to the ongoing support of Ann Kohl, the J. William Kohl Summer Scholarship for medical students continues to be an important source of inspiration and hope in UC Davis Eye Center's endeavor to promote young scholars in ophthalmology. This program was inspired by Ann's late husband, Bill Kohl, MD, who was one of the founding members of the UC Davis Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science as well as a champion for encouraging medical students to pursue ophthalmology as a specialty. Medical students from across the United States reached out with interest in the scholarship, having heard from educators and peers about this unique opportunity. The UC Davis faculty responded enthusiastically, with new mentors offering an array of projects. UC Davis had its largest group of applicants for the 2021 cycle, and was able to extend an invitation to eight young researchers. This opportunity provides a stipend of $2,500 for medical students undertaking mentored research in the vision sciences. Associated with this program is the J. William Kohl, M.D. Research Travel Grant, which consists of a $1,200 stipend per student. The grant is intended to defray the cost of presenting summer research at national ophthalmology conferences and meetings. Past and present participants have moved forward with applications to ophthalmology residency, and being a recipient of this scholarship is a pivotal accomplishment that helps students stand apart from other candidates. It has helped ignite continued interest in vision research in these future ophthalmologists, who will contribute to the advancement of the field for years to come. Program (CORT-TOP) will support advanced organoid technologies for the study of human ocular disease biology and is directed toward development of human ocular therapy. The overall mission is to generate and facilitate disease modeling using human organoids and to develop and initiate human translational therapy trials. The CORT-TOP will run a human ocular disease patient tissue clinical acquisition service and maintain an ocular disease biobank of iPSC transformed disease cells and organoids of select ocular diseases. The immediate and ultimate goal is to develop and support human ocular cell therapy trials. The program is directed by Anna LaTorre, Ph.D. and Ala Moshiri, M.D., Ph.D., in collaboration with Paul Sieving, M.D., Ph.D., and colleagues from the Eye Center and veterinary medicine. CLAIRE BURNS AUDACIOUS PROPOSALS 2021 GRANT PROGRAM Through a generous gift from the Burns, the Department of Ophthalmology & Vision Science is able to offer small seed grants for \"audacious\" proposals in vision care to members of the UC Davis faculty. The intent is to stimulate the testing of bold hypotheses, encourage engagement by experts both inside and outside the specialty field, and foster the creation of unique interdisciplinary teams to address unmet clinical needs in cornea and external disease. The premise of these grants is that investigators will use the funding to support novel ideas for therapeutics for the cornea and external eye that can be translated from bench to bedside. Our goal is to give an opportunity to investigators to explore a new idea with the potential to provide new diagnostic tools or treatments for disabling eye disease. The proposals funded from a very competitive pool of submissions include: Parisa Park, DVM, Ph.D., \"Evaluation of novel lipid extract to improve ocular surface health in a murine model of meibomian gland dysfunction.\" Min Zhao, Ph.D., Bioelectronics to Mobilize Corneal Epithelium for Wound Healing.\" Many thanks to the grant selection committee members, which included Eye Center alumni Neil Kelly, M.D., and Rick Lewis, M.D., as well as Eye Center faculty members Paul FitzGerald, Ph.D., Gary Novack, Ph.D., Mark Mannis, M.D., Ph.D. SUSANNA SOON-CHUN PARK, M.D., PH.D., INDUCTED AS THE INAUGURAL HOLDER OF THE BARBARA A.

William Kohl Summer Scholarship for medical students continues to be an important source of inspiration and hope in UC Davis Eye Center's endeavor to promote young scholars in ophthalmology. This program was inspired by Ann's late husband, Bill Kohl, MD, who was one of the founding members of the UC Davis Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science as well as a champion for encouraging medical students to pursue ophthalmology as a specialty. Medical students from across the United States reached out with interest in the scholarship, having heard from educators and peers about this unique opportunity. The UC Davis faculty responded enthusiastically, with new mentors offering an array of projects. UC Davis had its largest group of applicants for the 2021 cycle, and was able to extend an invitation to eight young researchers. This opportunity provides a stipend of $2,500 for medical students undertaking mentored research in the vision sciences. Associated with this program is the J. William Kohl, M.D. Research Travel Grant, which consists of a $1,200 stipend per student. The grant is intended to defray the cost of presenting summer research at national ophthalmology conferences and meetings. Past and present participants have moved forward with applications to ophthalmology residency, and being a recipient of this scholarship is a pivotal accomplishment that helps students stand apart from other candidates. It has helped ignite continued interest in vision research in these future ophthalmologists, who will contribute to the advancement of the field for years to come. 2021https:/ /health.ucdavis.edu/eyecenter/ 10 Clinical Trials Overview CLINICAL TRIALS SPOTLIGHT: Susanna Park, M.D., Ph.D., received grant funding from Cures Within Reach to start a phase 1 clinical trial exploring autologous CD34+ cells from bone marrow as treatment for retinitis pigmentosa.funded clinical trials upcoming funded trials (pending approvals) unfunded prospective trials retrospective chart review studies 13 6 14 22 11 enVision UC Davis Eye CenterIsaac Newton was a bit of a mystic, so it is unlikely to have escaped his notice that his birth on Christmas day, 1642, nearly coincided with the death of Galileo Galilei.

Below we see his 1671 illustration of the light rays being bent or refracted as they travel through the prism to form a spectrum on the opposite wall. Newton described the spectrum as giving rise to seven fundamental colors. Why Newton chose the number seven is not entirely certain, but he may have felt that there was something magical about this number; he remarked that as there are seven notes in an octave, with the eighth repeating, so too should there be seven sensations of hue. Newton's claim that there are seven fundamental hues (what is normally meant by \"color\") is still debated\u2014and it now invites other important questions. For example, if we experience a limited number of hue sensations, is it because we have that same limited number of nerve fiber types in the visual system? Prior to Newton, an answer might have been because we have a limited number of light qualities. For the next 30 years, Newton went on to conduct experiments in which he mixed various colors of the spectrum and depicted his results in the first semi-quantitative diagram of color mixture. With pure colors of the spectrum arranged on the circumference of a circle, all mixtures plotted inside, the exact point was weighted according to his center of gravity rule. He noted that when he mixed all the colors, the result appeared white, like the original sunlight before it passed through the prism. He therefore wrote that the \"rays are not coloured\"\u2014and stated that the reason for our color perception is not to be found in the nature of light, but the nature of our eye and brain. This insight was without precedent, and set the stage for modern vision science. Like Newton in his later years, scientists study vision by examining the neural pathways in the eye and brain. The years of the plague in Newton's lifetime spawned the creative thinking of a genius that led to the foundation of modern vision science. Now beginning in the visually symbolic year of 2020, we find ourselves in the midst of a global pandemic of unprecedented proportions.

Yet, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected every aspect of ophthalmology\u2014both clinical care and laboratory science.

When we think about our eye, we most often consider it as a light \"detector\", not as an electrical organ. The retina is very active electrically, however the electrical activity is essential to light detection and our vision. What is less known is that other parts of the eye manifest electrical activities too. For example, the cornea maintains distinct electrical potentials across various layers; the lens has unique electric currents that flow out of the anterior and posterior poles and return at the equator (Fig. 1). The electric currents across the cornea and circulating in the lens are maintained by the activity of molecules in the cell membrane, called ion channels, transporters, and pumps. When many cells accumulate to form tissues, these molecules and cells collectively consume energy to pump ions, thus generating electricity at the tissue level. Is electrical activity important in eye disease? There has been fascination with the use of electricity in medical practice for centuries. Edward Jackson, founder of the American Journal of Ophthalmology (AJO) and first president of the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology (AAOO), chronicled the use of galvanic and faradic currents commonly used to treat ocular diseases in the early 20th century. Recent decades have seen attempts at electrical stimulation for treatments of conditions of the cornea, lens, choroid, and retina.Significant advances in electronics and bioelectronics in recent years have brought about leading-edge technology: Visual Prosthetics.

We have found that when the cornea is injured or diseased (e.g. in diabetes), the electrical activity becomes abnormal. In a cataractous lens, the electric currents circulating around the lens become significantly weaker. Longer-term (several years) follow-up of electrical activity in the retina showed that an abnormal electroretinogram predicted the location of retinal pathology. Importantly, application of similar electrical stimulation to cells and tissues from eyes resulted in significant effects on cell migration, cell division, and intracellular signaling, which regulate gene expression (Fig. 3). Stem cells also respond very well to electrical stimulation. These responses are potentially beneficial to tissue repair and regeneration. These findings point to a new mechanism in the eye, in both health and disease: bioelectrical regulation . It is exciting to envisage that detection of electrical activities might offer us new diagnostic tools and that manipulating the electrical activity might result in new therapies. What do we do at UC Davis? The Min Zhao and Brian Reid Laboratory at UC Davis is using state- of-the-art probe systems to investigate changes in electricity in the eye to understand the role of bioelectricity in the eye in both health and disease. This is the only laboratory in the nation that has a unique vibrating probe, ion-selective probe, and optical electrode to detect minute electric currents, electrical fields, and fluxes of ions in biological tissues. The bioelectronic research at UC Davis has also pioneered and developed technology to deliver effective and safe electric stimulation to cells and tissues. In the past decade, the Zhao Laboratory has collaborated with Drs. Mannis, Schwab, Chodosh, Murphy and other colleagues to answer: 1) how cells and tissues generate and regulate bioelectricity; 2) how cells detect and respond to weak bioelectricity; and 3) how eye tissues can be electrically stimulate to achieve regeneration in injuries and diseases With colleagues from Johns Hopkins, University of Maryland, UC Santa Cruz, Tufts University, and other institutions, we at UC Davis are developing a new generation of bioelectronics to tap into this new frontier of biology. Exploiting electricity in the eye, we aim to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for the management of eye injuries and disease. Our research is currently supported by grants from the NIH, the Air Force, DARPA, and a generous donation from the Burns family. We believe there is great potential in harnessing the bioelectricity of the eye for both diagnosis and treatment. nFig. 3. Contact lens electronics. A, B.

Meet Kaitryn (Kaity) Ronning, a trainee in the lab of Dr. Marie Burns.Kaity is homegrown talent, born and raised in the Davis area. She graduated from our own public schools, attending Patwin Elementary School all the way through Davis Senior High School. A child of teachers, she and her sister were encouraged in all manner of learning, including music. Unlike her sister, Kaity did not chose music as a career; rather, she chose the path of science, although to this day she plays as a double bassist in the UC Davis Symphony Orchestra. A big factor that led Kaity to science as a career was a brief internship during high school working in a genetics lab at UC Davis. But it was our own Dr. Marie Burns, whom Kaity first met through the alumni program of her collegiate alma mater, Susquehanna University, who instilled in her a love for vision science. Kaity worked in the Burns lab for several summers during college, and then returned there once she became a graduate student in the UC Davis Neuroscience Graduate Program. Her doctoral work in the Burns Lab addresses the important question of what happens in the eye not to cells that are affected by disease or injury, but to the concurrent immune response. Microglial cells, which are immune cells resident to the eye, are thought to be the first responders to all sorts of trouble. In a recent publication, Kaity's work demonstrated that when photoreceptors are damaged, as they are in the common blinding disease macular degeneration, the expression of genes within microglia changes dramatically, and that soon after an injury they are joined in the retina by other immune cells coming from the blood circulation, which become nearly indistinguishable from the resident microglia cells. She gained this insight using a technique called single-cell sequencing, which she and her high school friends had once discussed as purely science fiction. (Fig 1) The last question she wants to answer before obtaining her Ph.D. is whether the \"newcomer\" cells are as good as the original microglia at protecting the retina from further damage. After she graduates, Kaity plans to seek post-doctoral training to learn more about how the immune system affects health and disease in the central nervous system. After that, Kaity wants to become a professor like her mentor, Dr. Burns. Kaity, like many other scientists, believes that we will soon know enough about the immune response to harness it to treat various diseases, including those that rob people of vision. Kaity is committed to helping lay the basic science foundation needed for such future medicines. nKaitryn Ronning, trainee in the lab of Dr. Marie Burns, and Dr. Marie Burns.Figure 12021https:/ /health.ucdavis.edu/eyecenter/ 20 19 enVision UC Davis Eye CenterTHE FUTURE OF BASIC SCIENCE One of the most important missions of the UC Davis Health Department of Ophthalmology & Vision Science is to train the next generation of vision scientists.

After she graduates, Kaity plans to seek post-doctoral training to learn more about how the immune system affects health and disease in the central nervous system. After that, Kaity wants to become a professor like her mentor, Dr. Burns. Kaity, like many other scientists, believes that we will soon know enough about the immune response to harness it to treat various diseases, including those that rob people of vision. Kaity is committed to helping lay the basic science foundation needed for such future medicines. n Kaitryn Ronning, trainee in the lab of Dr. Marie Burns, and Dr. Marie Burns.Figure 12021https:/ /health.ucdavis.edu/eyecenter/ 22 21 enVision UC Davis Eye CenterAN INTERVIEW WITH MICHAEL CONDRINUC DAVIS HEALTH LEADERSHIP PROFILE Outpatient medicine has taken on increasing importance in the last decade, and this trend has been an important feature of the development of clinical services at UC Davis Health. Ophthalmology is primarily an outpatient service\u2014hence, the importance of providing prompt, efficient, and cost-effective care to our patients. At the center of this emphasis on outpatient services at UC Davis Health is Michael Condrin, who now serves as Chief Operating Officer, Ambulatory Care Services, and who has provided important guidance and assistance to the Eye Center and its growing patient population. Mike Condrin, a native of the San Francisco Bay Area, found his entry into medicine through physical therapy. Through high school and college athletics, he developed an interest in the physiological sciences, and after completing his degree at UCLA, he went on to obtain a degree in physical therapy at Boston University. He practiced outpatient physical therapy for seven years in a variety of settings including a sports and occupational setting in Castro Valley as well as in the San Francisco Airport, where he worked with baggage handlers, flight attendants, pilots, and others on staff. With a growing interest in administration, Condrin came to UC Davis in 2000 to obtain an M.B.A. degree. Inspired by Bill McGowan and Nabil Musallam, who at that time led the financial and outpatient services administratively at UC Davis, he worked as a senior budget analyst in finance. Moving from the analyst position, Mr. Condrin spent two years as Chief Administrative Officer for the Department of Orthopedics and from 2005-2008 held the same position in Internal Medicine under the leadership of Dr. Fredrick Meyers. In 2008, he joined the Dean's office as Assistant Dean for Administration and Finance (2008-2013). In 2013, he became Director of Clinical Operations and he was recently placed in charge of all outpatient services\u2014a huge portion of UC Davis Health's operations. When asked about the outward- bound direction of UC Davis, Mike Condrin emphasizes the plan to move as much of the complex care from inpatient to outpatient as possible. He sees this as better for patients and caregivers alike. In terms of the growth of UC Davis Health, he looks to expand outpatient services to Solano, Napa, San Joaquin, Sutter, Colusa, Yuba, and El Dorado counties and to develop regional partners for the delivery of tertiary care by UC Davis. To this end, his staff is working tirelessly to improve capacity, ease of access, and efficiency of outpatient services delivery. During the past year, the pandemic has occupied much of Condrin's attention, both in terms of keeping employees safe as well as the protean efforts to provide testing through a partnership with Sacramento County. His unit has developed vaccination sites at the Med Center, the Scottish Rites facility, Oak Park, and South Sacramento as well as assisted efforts for the homeless in the community. Condrin sees UC Davis Health as a complex system made up of 19 clinical departments, dozens of diverse service lines, and thousands of employees all on the complicated landscape of contemporary medicine. \"Our greatest strength,\" he points out, \"is, first and foremost, the dedicated people who work here. Then there is the incredible and enabling technology that moves us to the forefront of the field in our region.\" Condrin sees this as a point of pride for everyone who works at UC Davis. Outside the office, Mike is the proud father of three sons: a junior at the University of Washington, a graduating senior, and a junior in high school. Like their father, his sons are budding athletes. Mike's spouse, Amy, works in a consultancy that advises dental practices. In his leisure time, Mike has become a licensed falconer, developing the requisite skills in hunting with redtailed hawks\u2014 and soon merlin falcons. Inspired by UC Davis veterinarian Bill Ferrier, Mike has learned the complicated process of training these remarkable birds to trust him and work with him before he ultimately releases them again into the wild. Condrin has been a consistent and dedicated supporter of ophthalmic services at UC Davis. He notes, \"I am so happy to see the Tschannen Eye Institute becoming a reality. This will be a key regional facility for patients with significant eye disease. It is one of the crowning accomplishments of this excellent department. We are glad to see that the Eye Center is outbound as is all of UC Davis Health.

Luis Izquierdo, a native of Lima, Peru, came to UC Davis to undertake a fellowship in Cornea and External Disease with Dr. Mannis in 1998-99. Coming from a family of ophthalmologists\u2014his father, a prominent practitioner in Lima, and his brother, a glaucoma specialist, also trained at UC Davis, Luis completed his residency training in ophthalmology at the prestigious Paulista School of Medicine in Sao Paulo, Brazil. After the completion of his ophthalmological training in Brazil He then decided to come to UC Davis for specialty training in Cornea, then returned to Lima and his family's practice, Oftalmosalud. Luis is currently the Medical Director at Oftalmosalud, which has its own residency and fellowship training programs, attracting fellows from around the world to study with Dr. Izquierdo and his associates. He is also an Associate Professor of Ophthalmology at the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos in Lima. Luis has become a leader of ophthalmology in Latin America, serving as the president of the Latin American Association of Cataract and Anterior Segment Surgery and president of the Peruvian Ophthalmological Society. He is widely considered to be one of Latin America's most respected ophthalmic surgeons. His practice in Lima\u2014founded by his father almost 30 years ago\u2014has multiple sites and collectively sees more than 18,000 patients a month and performs 7,000 surgical procedures annually. The state-of-the-art facility boasts 20 operating rooms, 4 Excimer lasers, 36 ophthalmologists, 400 employees, 25 residents, and 10 fellows from around Latin America and Europe. In addition to his busy practice and his academic productivity, Luis has spearheaded social programs for individuals who do not have the means to obtain surgery, performing more than 5,000 cataract operations gratis. He was honored by the Peruvian government as Embajador de la Marca Peru\u2014only one of two physicians holding this title to represent Peru in medicine throughout the world. An avid surfer and dedicated family man, Luis is the husband of Maria Alejandra Henriquez, M.D., also a talented ophthalmologist and director of the research division at Oftalmosalud. They have four lovely children. Together, Luis and Maria have published numerous studies in high-quality, refereed journals. Dr. Izquierdo and Dr. Henriquez are currently the lead authors in a book collaboration with Dr. Mannis. Dr. Mannis points out, \"The greatest source of pride for a teacher is when his students surpass him.\" Indeed, Luis Izquierdo is a wonderful ambassador for the programs at UC Davis. He brings us great pride. n Claudia Pinilla, M.D. Upon walking through the doors of the Danville San Ramon Eye Medical Corp., the positive environment and strong culture among team members is immediately evident. Each person in Dr. Pinilla's practice is compassionate, bright and thoughtful in their interactions with patients and visitors. Not surprisingly, if you ask Dr. Pinilla about her career as an ophthalmologist, the first thing she will do is acknowledge her staff for their efforts in making the practice a successful, inviting place for patients to receive top-notch vision care. As one grateful patient shared, \"Right away I liked Dr. Pinilla's professionalism and the time she spent with me to answer my questions. She took time to calm my nerves when the surgery date was set, which I needed and appreciated. I had the surgery and knew it was done by a wonderful doctor. The entire staff in this office is so nice and very efficient.\"From Serving Food to Serving Patients Dr. Pinilla was born in Colombia and as a child moved with her family to the Bay Area, where her parents opened the Little Red Hen restaurant. The youngest of seven children, Claudia enjoyed working in the family restaurant with her siblings and parents. But she always had an interest in medicine, which led to jobs in local hospitals. Claudia credits a distant family friend with igniting her interest in ophthalmology as a specialty. Prior to completing her residency at the UC Davis Eye Center in 1990, Dr. Pinilla earned her undergraduate degree at the University of Santa Clara with a B.S. in Biology. She then attended UC San Francisco School of Medicine, where she obtained her M.D., followed by an internship at San Francisco's Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center. Dr. Pinilla met her husband, Dr. Barry Latner, a pathologist at John Muir Medical Center, in medical school and the couple married after their first year. They have two children. Their son Joshua, is completing a residency in internal medicine at the University of Florida, while their daughter Brooke manages the Embarcadero COVID Collection Site at Carbon Health. A few of Dr. Pinilla's favorite experiences as a resident at UC Davis Eye Center include: The opportunity to work and live with her sister, who was a staff member at the Eye Center Training with fellow resident David Shapiro, MD, and together selecting Bob Miller, M.D., as teacher of the year Training with Mark Mannis, M.D., F.A.C.S., and John Keltner, M.D., and learning of Dr. Keltner's passion for nutrition and love of bran muffins Being invited to the home of Linda Margulies, M.D., for dinner during the Veterans Affairs rotation Even after completing her residency, Dr. Pinilla and Dr. Margulies maintained a strong connection. In reflecting on Dr. Margulies as a mentor and a friend, Dr. Pinilla said, \"I can't thank her enough for her contributions to my success.\" From Dr. Pinilla's perspective, \"What makes the Eye Center distinct from other residency training programs is the outstanding Volunteer Clinical Faculty (VCF) and the exposure to exceptional ophthalmologists such as Neil Kelly, Rob Wendel, Barbara Arnold, Bob Miller, and Craig Berris, to name a few.\"Recognizing Her Special Talents Former department chair John Keltner, shared: \"Dr. Pinilla was not simply a talented surgeon. She was a great listener, thoughtful, diligent, and always a delight to be around. It was a pleasure to watch her continue to develop her skills and knowledge throughout her residency, and it's no surprise she went on to build a thriving, well-regarded practice.\" Current department chair Mark Mannis, likewise has fond memories of working with Claudia as a resident and staying connected post-residency through the UC Davis Eye Center Napa Symposium, Resident and Alumni Day, and the AAO. \"Claudia is a very kind and warm person in addition to being a gifted ophthalmologist,\" said Dr. Mannis. \"I'm very proud of all she has accomplished and to see all she has done to care for those with vision needs. She has stayed connected and been a great friend to the department since she completed her residency, and it's an honor to count her among our distinguished alumni.\" One of the many attributes that makes Dr. Pinilla a superb practitioner is her genuine regard for the wellbeing of others\u2014her patients, her staff members, her family, her friends, and her fellow resident alumni\u2014not to mention the ease with which she earns the trust of practitioners who themselves require vision care. \"Dr. Pinilla's practice can be busy, and the staff doesn't have an abundance of time to socialize,\" said one grateful patient. \"What Dr. Pinilla has is an abundance of skill. She's a gifted surgeon and a no-nonsense practitioner. If you want to know how good an eye doctor she is and how good this practice is, ask another physician. I think you'll find that she is well respected.\" When Dr. Pinilla is not in clinic or surgery, she enjoys attending Best of Broadway performances with her husband and her friends the Margulies. She also enjoys hiking, walking her dogs, spending time with her family, and just relaxing. Yet her thoughts are never far from ophthalmology. Dr. Pinilla is in awe of the advancements made in the past 30 years for cataract surgery, and her hope for the future is that we will continue to see advancements in the treatment of glaucoma and optic nerve damage. If history is any indicator, Dr. Pinilla will play an important role in delivering those breakthroughs to her patients with a unique combination of skill and compassion. n 2021https:/ /health.ucdavis.edu/eyecenter/ 38 37 enVision UC Davis Eye Center ALUMNI HIGHLIGHTS Luis Izquierdo Jr., M.D. , Ph.D.The educational outreach of the Department of Ophthalmology at UC Davis is broad, training residents and fellows not only from around the United States but from all of the Americas and beyond.

A native of the San Joaquin Valley, Dr. Morse completed a bachelor's degree at UC Riverside, a PhD at the University of Chicago, and both his MD and ophthalmic residency at UCLA. He then completed his advanced training in vitreo-retinal surgery at Duke University before returning to California to join the faculty at UC Davis. While Dr. Morse's research was far-reaching and diverse, in the latter part of his career he focused on fostering an interactive collaboration between members of the UC Davis Eye Center group and the Ophthalmology Retina service to develop a retinal gene therapy and stem cell replacement program to treat retinal disease. To this end, over the course of his career, Dr. Morse published over 200 peer-reviewed articles, 203 abstracts, and 6 book chapters. He also presented 218 academic lectures, both domestic and international. As a colleague, Dr. Morse will be remembered for his collegiality, his passion for doing the right thing, and his unwavering resistance to the bureaucracy of an academic medical center. Upon retirement, Dr. Morse has since relocated to South Carolina with the hope of spending more time with his family and finding productive fly-fishing waters on par with that of Northern California. Dr. Ivan Schwab was appointed as a faculty in the UC Davis Eye Center on September 1, 1989. Hailing from the great state of West Virginia, Dr. Schwab received a BA and MD from West Virginia University, and completed both his residency and advanced training in Corneal and Reconstructive Surgery at Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco and at the Francis I. Proctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco. Prior to his appointment as a faculty member at UC Davis, he was faculty physician at West Virginia University for seven years. Dr. Schwab is widely considered a founding member of the Cornea service, including the Cornea Fellowship training program. Over the course of his career, Dr. Schwab received numerous teaching accolades including 'Professor of the Millennium' in 2000 and 'Best Teacher' numerous times as awarded by graduating residents. On the research front, Dr. Schwab's interests were truly far-reaching, spanning the topics of cell biology, translational research, public policy, and comparative ophthalmology. Throughout the course of his career, Dr. Schwab published over 220 peer-reviewed journal articles, 34 book chapters, and authored 6 books, including \"Evolution's Witness: How Eyes Evolved,\" in 2011. Dr. Schwab will be remembered as a fantastic colleague and teacher, for his love of all things sports (particularly West Virginia athletics), and his thoughtful and sophisticated responses to almost every question posed in his direction. Robert B. Miller, MD transferred his practice, Advanced Valley Eye Associates, to the UC Davis Eye Center in September, 2019 after many years of successful practice in the community as a high-quality general ophthalmologist. At the same time, Dr. Miller joined the full- time faculty of the Department of Ophthalmology & Vision Science at UC Davis in Comprehensive Ophthalmology. Over the years, Bob has continuously served the Department as a volunteer clinical faculty, teaching our residents and students in an outpatient setting and has been a loyal supporter and advocate of the Department within the greater ophthalmic community. Dr. Miller's Natalie Homer, M.D. Assistant Professor | Ophthalmic Plastic and Orbital Surgery Dr. Natalie Homer is an assistant professor of ophthalmology and specializes in plastic and reconstructive surgical procedures of the eyelids, orbit, nasolacrimal system and face. She completed fellowships with the American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (ASOPRS) and with the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery (AACS), training in procedures including rhytidectomy, platysmaplasty, forehead/ brow lift, upper and lower blepharoplasty, and autologous fat transfer. Dr. Homer is board certified in both ophthalmology and facial cosmetic surgery. She has clinical and research interests in the areas of orbital oncology, orbital and facial trauma, periorbital infections, eyelid and facial reconstruction, facial nerve palsy, pediatric orbital and adnexal disorders, nasolacrimal surgery, thyroid eye disease, cosmetic facial surgery, wound healing, and oculoplastic education.

FACULTY UPDATES FACULTY RETIREMENTS It is with mixed emotions that we announce the retirement of three long-standing faculty members from the UC Davis Eye Center. Marcela M. Estrada, M.D. Assistant Professor | Pediatric Ophthalmology and Adult Strabismus Dr. Marcela Estrada joined the UC Davis department of ophthalmology in October of 2020. As an assistant professor in ophthalmology, Dr. Estrada specializes in comprehensive pediatric ophthalmology and adult strabismus. Her growing practice includes the medical and surgical management of a range of ocular conditions including amblyopia, pediatric cataracts, nasolacrimal duct obstruction, retinopathy of prematurity, and pediatric and adult strabismus. She has a deep research interest in retinopathy of prematurity, having published and presented her work at numerous national meetings. She is a member of the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), American Academy of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus (AAPOS), Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO), and Women in Ophthalmology. Raised in Lodi, California, Dr. Estrada earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Human Biology from Stanford University and her M.D. from the University of Iowa. She completed her ophthalmology residency training at the University of Washington, followed by a fellowship in pediatric ophthalmology at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Dr. Estrada's interests in clinical ophthalmology and research are complemented by her interest in promoting advocacy, diversity, and inclusion in ophthalmology and medicine. She serves as a member of the AAPOS Young Ophthalmology Committee and is a committee chair for the UC Davis Health's Inclusion, Diversity, Anti-Racism, and Equity initiative. We are thrilled that Dr. Estrada returned to her home state of California to join UC Davis, and we look forward to having her as an integral member of our growing community. Min Zhao, M.D., Ph.D. Professor, Dermatology and Ophthalmology, Institute for Regenerative Cures Min Zhao's research focuses on 1) understanding how electrical activities in our body help to heal and regenerate; and 2) exploiting such electrical mechanisms to treat injuries and diseases, with a focus on the eye. His lab led experimental discoveries that wound electric fields provide an overriding guidance mechanism for cell migration, and the first sets of genes underlying the response. Mr. Zhao graduated from the Third Military Medical University in China and obtained his Ph.D. in trauma surgery and pathology. He moved to England in 1994 and was trained under Geoff Burnstock at University College London. He then established his lab with a prestigious Wellcome Trust Strategic Award at University of Aberdeen, Scotland and worked closely with Professors John Forrester and Colin McCaig. He was selected to present at the House of Commons as one of the top young scientists of the UK in 2001. Mr. Zhao was promoted to full professor and personal chair in Regenerative Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, and honorary consultant in the Department of Ophthalmology at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in 2004. He moved his lab to UC Davis in 2007 with appointments in the Department of Dermatology and the Department of Ophthalmology. His research has been continuously supported by the NIH, the Air Force, DARPA, and NSF. His work has been published in Nature, PNAS, Nature Communications, Nature Protocols, the Journal of Cell Biology, AJO, IOVS, and other peer- reviewed journals. The Zhao lab has unique expertise, with Dr. Brian Reid as a leading member, and unique equipment, using instrumentation to map minute electrical signals at cells and tissues. There are no other labs in the United States with this capacity. The Zhao lab developed a gold-standard method of controlled application of electrical stimulation of cells and tissues, that has been widely adopted and practiced. The unique expertise of the Zhao lab, with 25 years' experience and a solid track record, has made it a base for visitors and collaborations in bioelectricity and wound healing across the country and around the world. The Zhao laboratory is working with ophthalmologists, dermatologists, biologists, engineers, physicists, and mathematicians from Johns Hopkins University, Princeton University, Oxford University, UC Santa Cruz, Tufts University, and others to develop novel bioelectronics to treat eye injuries and diseases, promising novel therapies: electroceuticals.

He was at home with his wife, Mary Kay, and daughter, Anna, when he succumbed to complications of diabetes. Larry was born in 1948 in Atascadero, California. He graduated from Stanford in 1971 with a degree in Mathematics and Chemistry. Remarkably, he published his first paper as an undergraduate, an article in \"Discrete Mathematics\", entitled \"Constructive graph labeling using double cosets\". He used to joke that this was the last time his name and the word \"discrete\" appeared on the same page. Larry entered the Ph.D. program in Biophysical Chemistry at Stanford in 1971. His main area of study was the quantum chemistry of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, but he continued work in math and computer science, participating in the first forays into artificial intelligence. He received his Ph.D. in 1976. In 1977, Larry moved to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at the NIH in Bethesda, where he was a staff fellow. At this time, the field of protein electrophoresis was undergoing a renaissance but was plagued by the problem of isolating insoluble membrane proteins while retaining functionality. Larry brought his chemistry training to bear, working to develop detergents that could achieve this goal. While he published many manuscripts during this period at the NICHD, a highlight was his synthesis and patenting of a zwitterionic, non-denaturing detergent, referred to as CHAPS, which became very widely used by cell biologists and biochemists. This achievement earned him the Inventor's Award from the NIH. In 1982, Larry moved to the National Eye Institute where, he began work on growth factors and their role in a variety of ocular processes such as cell migration, differentiation, wound repair, and neovascularization, a theme that would characterize his work until his retirement. John Keltner, M.D., former Chair of the U.C. Davis Department of Ophthalmology, recruited Larry to the ophthalmology faculty in 1986. Larry went on to procure decades of funding from the National Eye Institute, and from private foundations. He built a laboratory that became the training ground for numerous Ph.D. students who went on to careers in academia, medicine, industry, and foundations. He also mentored many ophthalmologists to careers as clinician-scientists at major academic medical centers.These included many scholars from Japan and Switzerland. Ultimately, Larry contributed 113 manuscripts to the scholarly literature, advancing knowledge across a wide range of disciplines and establishing himself as a highly respected scientist, known internationally for his work. Through his work and his mentoring, he had a major impact on the field of vision research, advancing knowledge and training the next generation of scientists. Notably, the publication in which he described the development of a human retinal pigmented epithelial cell line, called \"ARPE 19\", remains the most cited work in the history of the \"Experimental Eye Research\" journal. This cell line enabled an enormous number of valuable advances in the study of the retinal pigment epithelium and is now being used by pharmaceutical companies for the development of therapeutic approaches to treating ocular disease and producing protein pharmacologics. In addition to his bench research, Larry contributed at many key levels, both to the campus and to the national and international community of vision research. At UC Davis, Larry served as the Chair of the Department of Biological Chemistry, Acting Associate Dean for Research in the School of Medicine, and as Special Assistant to the Provost where he chaired the building committee for the genome and biomedical sciences facility. He served on the editorial boards of major journals, as a consultant to industry partners, and a member of NIH Study Sections, to name but a few on a long list of activities. Larry's career success qualifies as \"stellar\" by any measure, but it is all the more compelling in light of the obstacles he had to overcome. As a teenager he was diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes, and ultimately lost his sight to it while working at the National Eye Institute in the early '80s. To overcome this, Larry was at the leading edge of machine-human interfacing, consulting with companies that developed talking computers, and later smartphones. When Larry's kidneys began to fail, he was kept alive by dialysis until he received a transplant from his sister. While waiting for the transplant he developed prostate cancer, which delayed the transplant and extended his time on dialysis. He also dealt with several serious squamous cell carcinomas, and two incidents of sepsis, one as a result of a surgery to correct a broken hip. Despite these life- threatening events, Larry maintained an admirable equanimity and a remarkable sense of humor. To those of us who have known him for decades, it was remarkable to never have heard him complain; it just wasn't in his nature. That Larry succeeded in the face of such obstacles defies description. Larry managed to meet every new challenge he faced. He was a man of exceptional empathy for others, and his resilience and perseverance in the face of innumerable setbacks inspired and motivated everyone who knew him. Larry's astounding intellect, seemingly unlimited memory, and broad knowledge never ceased to amaze. There seemed to be no area in which he was not deeply knowledgeable and well-read, from theology and philosophy to quantum mechanics, from Pink Floyd to Persian poetry.This year, UC Davis Eye Center lost several dear friends whose vision, dedication, and generosity will always be remembered.

In that, he achieved perhaps his greatest success. Larry made a huge impact, both scientific and personal, on all our lives, and he will be greatly missed. Shelly Schermer was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Henry and Doris and had a brother named Larry. She attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where she joined the Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority and graduated in 1966. One spring day in 1965, on the steps of the Sammy fraternity house, she met Michael. They were married in Ann Arbor in December 1965 and were married for 54 years. Shelly put Michael through medical school by working as a high school teacher in Pinkney, Michigan. She gave birth to two remarkable boys, David and Ethan, who spent two of their childhood years with the family on the Papago Indian Reservation in Arizona. When they moved to Davis in 1972, Shelly decided to attend law school, first at McGeorge, then at UC Davis King Hall, where she was Order of the Coif, graduating number two in the class of 1977. Shelly always said, \"hope for the best and prepare for the worst,\" but she was not prepared for when her beloved son Ethan unexpectedly passed away in 2009. The serenity prayer helped her to heal and gave her the strength to provide essential support for others at that tragic time. Shelly was hit by lightning on June 28, 2019, leaving her no longer able to walk. Her last days were colored by a unique mixture of love, comfort, and sadness. Her last breath was taken on Wednesday, December 2, 2020, at home, cradled in the arms of Michael and David. She now rests with her son Ethan, her father, who was her role model, and her dear mother. Shelly was a beacon of hope and light for many who have experienced vision loss, and a role model to countless individuals in the Sacramento region and beyond. Elise Kathleen Dale Fong was the truly delightful child of Bonnie Dale, a longstanding member of the Eye Center Advisory Council. Elise attended school in Santa Rosa, California, graduating from Santa Rosa High School in 1985. She attended Sacramento State University and earned both a bachelor's and a master's degree in Communications. Elise worked for The March of Dimes, with her main responsibility being the coordination of Walk America for the Northern California region. On January 29, 1994, she married Glenn Fong, and they began their life together in the Sacramento area. In 1999, she became a mom when Sarah was born. Two years later, Katy came into the family. When the girls were old enough, Elise became a Girl Scout leader and held that position until fall 2020. She also served as the adult advisor for Alpha Phi at Sacramento State. Part of Elise's legacy during her final illness was to establish a fund to be made available to her sorority to fulfill the needs of the membership. In addition to this fund, Bonnie created the Bonnie Dale Fund for Advancements in Glaucoma in Memory of Elise Dale Fong. Elise was a truly wonderful daughter and friend. She lost her battle to cancer on December 4, 2020. She will be missed Norman Frederick Schwilk, M.D. , passed away peacefully on December 27, 2020. He was a beloved husband of Reba for 67 years, father of Janine and Kenneth, grandfather of Hailey and John, brother to Sharon Hoffart and Elizabeth Rudd, and dedicated ophthalmologist. Norman was a graduate of C.K. McClatchy High School as well as UC Berkley. Norman graduated from UCLA Medical School in 1955. He was a member of the U.S. Air Force and honorably discharged in 1961. Norman's hobbies were traveling and woodworking. He will be missed immensely. Dr. Schwilk was a longstanding supporter of the UC Davis Health Eye Center and dear friend to the department. He served for many years in the capacity of volunteer clinical faculty, teaching and staffing our residents. Henry Zeiter, M.D. , a beloved husband, father, grandfather, great grandfather, and uncle and prominent ophthalmologist in our region passed away peacefully after experiencing congestive heart failure in his Lodi, California, home. He was 86 years old. Born in Lebanon, Henry grew up speaking Arabic and French. He later became fluent in Spanish after moving to Venezuela with his family. At age 16, Henry, along with his parents, moved to Ontario, Canada where he completed secondary school at Assumption High School and became fluent in English. (As an adult, he became fluent in his fifth language, Italian.) He attended Assumption College in Windsor where he studied philosophy and literature, as well as the sciences, which led him into the field of medicine at the University of Western Ontario Medical School. He did his internship and residency in ophthalmology at Harper Hospital and the Kresge Eye Institute in Detroit, Michigan. At Harper Hospital, Henry met the love of his life, Carol Joyce Schooff. Their oldest son, John Henry, was born the following December in Detroit, with son Philip Joseph and daughters Suzanne Antoinette and Camille Marie subsequently born in Stockton, California. After completing residency, they moved to Stockton, California in 1962, where Henry began a successful surgical ophthalmic practice in downtown Stockton. He was later joined by his Dr. Joe Zeiter, then by his son, Dr. John, and later still by his great nephew, Dr. Joseph Zeiter. The Zeiter Eye Medical Group continues to thrive nearly 60 years later, currently employing six ophthalmologists, 8 optometrists, and 100 staff. As a \"Jiddo\" (Arabic for grandfather), Henry was happily anticipating his grandson, Dr. John Henry Jr., joining the family business in two years. Henry Zeiter practiced ophthalmology for 40 years, never tiring of the intricacy of the eye and helping people to see. Throughout his life, another of Henry's passions was classical music, which he knew and loved from childhood. Thanks to Carol, he also learned to love tennis and skiing, but an even bigger pleasure for him was travel.SHELLY SCHERMER June 29, 1944 - December 2, 2020NORMAN FREDERICK SCHWILK, M.D. May 25, 1929 - December 27, 2020 ELISE KATHLEEN DALE FONG August 21, 1967 - December 4, 2020 2021https:/ /health.ucdavis.edu/eyecenter/ 58 57 enVision UC Davis Eye CenterHENRY ZEITER, M.D. July 1934- December 20, 2020When queried by his peers about where he found the strength to keep pushing, he attributed it to his desire to be the best husband, father, and provider to his wife, Mary Kay, and daughter, Anna.

Michael Zaharas was born in April 1931. He met his wife, Karen, in 1965, and they married in 1966. Michael valued his relationship with the Eye Center, especially with Dr. Mannis. Karen and Michael leaned on the Eye Center for vision care and support. Not only did they feel supported by the Eye Center, but Michael always talked about the high skill level of the faculty and their dedication to patients. The day before he passed, he was having a hard time speaking up and whispered to Karen, \"Trust Dr. Mannis. He knows what he is doing, and he can take care of you.\" Sadly, he passed away the next day in March 2021 after losing his battle with pancreatic cancer. UC Davis Ophthalmology alumnus Thomas W. Purcell II , age 80, of Bayfield, Wisconsin, passed away on March 16, 2021, at his home. He was born on February 23, 1941, in Clarion, Iowa, to Robert and Frances Purcell. From Neil Kelly: In undergraduate school, Thomas played basketball at the University of Iowa. After medical school, he was drafted and went to Vietnam. After being discharged, he was admitted to the ophthalmology residency at UC Davis. Tom married a young woman from Australia and had two sons with her. After his residency, he completed a plastic surgery fellowship and specialized in ophthalmic plastic surgery. Tom was an expert snow skier, and together with former residents Jack Hughes and Neil Kelly, they skied most of the top skiing sites in western North America. Tom also was an expert sailor, and he ultimately built his own large sailing catamaran. Tom's wife, Liz, preceded him in death, and he is survived by his two sons, Brett and Thomas.

CONSTRUCTION UPDATEEYE CENTER BUILDING 65 enVision UC Davis Eye Center 2021https:/ /health.ucdavis.edu/eyecenter/ 66 TECHN L GY Connecting People with Vision Loss to Health Care and Employment By Shari Roeseler, Executive Director One thing we know is that blindness and vision loss do not stop for a pandemic. People experiencing vision loss need help today. They need access to low vision eye care, classes, and support services so they can learn non-visual techniques and become proficient with assistive devices that enable them to live independently, find employment, and pursue their interests. One of our long-term goals for Society for the Blind's Low Vision Clinic was to establish a telemedicine program. The pandemic turned that goal into a reality in August 2020. The result is that our patients are able to have a portion of their low vision evaluation conducted from the comfort of their own homes. As a result, our doctors have found patients to be more relaxed and open about their vision challenges. When they do come in for their eye examinnation, the appointment is shorter and there is more time to demonstrate assistive devices. A priority at Society for the Blind is to help our clients find or retain employment. This past year has not been favorable for finding jobs, yet our team persevered- and more importantly, our clients stayed focused on their goals, with 14 finding employment in 2020. The expansion of remote work opportunities coupled with the advances in assistive technology are positive steps for increasing employment for people with vision loss. Technology, from Zoom to iPhones to myriad assistive devices, is keeping our clients connected to one another. Technology is also playing a critical role in making it possible for our clients to pursue careers or keep the jobs they love, despite having lost some or all of their eyesight. Society for the Blind, in partnership with the UC Davis Eye Center, provides a continuum of care for people experiencing vision loss. \"We know that vision loss does not mean you have to give up your hopes and dreams,\" said Dr. Mark Mannis, Professor and Chair. \"Society for the Blind provides the training and support people need to get back to work and other activities they enjoy doing. The society is an important and valuable resource for our region.\" Vision loss, like a pandemic, can come upon us with little warning. The measures we take to respond makes all the difference. We have learned a lot this past year, and it has helped us reshape our programming and service delivery in a way that enables more people with vision loss to access our services. We look forward to returning to in-person classes later this year, providing a full complement of options to people living with low vision or blindness to discover, develop, and achieve their full potential. nConstruction on the new Ernest E.

As a result, our doctors have found patients to be more relaxed and open about their vision challenges. When they do come in for their eye examinnation, the appointment is shorter and there is more time to demonstrate assistive devices. A priority at Society for the Blind is to help our clients find or retain employment. This past year has not been favorable for finding jobs, yet our team persevered- and more importantly, our clients stayed focused on their goals, with 14 finding employment in 2020. The expansion of remote work opportunities coupled with the advances in assistive technology are positive steps for increasing employment for people with vision loss. Technology, from Zoom to iPhones to myriad assistive devices, is keeping our clients connected to one another. Technology is also playing a critical role in making it possible for our clients to pursue careers or keep the jobs they love, despite having lost some or all of their eyesight. Society for the Blind, in partnership with the UC Davis Eye Center, provides a continuum of care for people experiencing vision loss. \"We know that vision loss does not mean you have to give up your hopes and dreams,\" said Dr. Mark Mannis, Professor and Chair. \"Society for the Blind provides the training and support people need to get back to work and other activities they enjoy doing. The society is an important and valuable resource for our region.\" Vision loss, like a pandemic, can come upon us with little warning. The measures we take to respond makes all the difference. We have learned a lot this past year, and it has helped us reshape our programming and service delivery in a way that enables more people with vision loss to access our services. We look forward to returning to in-person classes later this year, providing a full complement of options to people living with low vision or blindness to discover, develop, and achieve their full potential. n OPTICAL SHOP Ask an Eye Center staff member today!

I am Bonnie Dale, a member of the UC Davis Health Eye Center's Executive Advisory Council and a grateful patient. I follow a Glaucoma Support Group on Facebook, which has members from all over the world. I have always found it interesting to read about how patients in other parts of the world manage their illness and how they receive their care. I feel blessed about the care that the UC Davis Health Eye Center has provided for me and the availability of outstanding care this country has to offer. Last week, a young woman named Mona mentioned that she wanted to start a support group. I immediately contacted her to let her know that I had a support group and would be happy to offer ideas. I invited her to attend our Sun City Glaucoma Support Group virtual zoom meeting last August. Mona lives in Egypt, and the time difference is nine hours, but she made sure to join us for the meeting. Mona is a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) seven years ago. She is a young woman and described her struggle in dealing with her diagnosis. When Mona attended our virtual meeting, I was able to watch her reactions to the reports and interactions of the participants. She was invited to share her story and join in on the conversations. After the meeting concluded, I asked her to wait a few moments so that we could talk privately. I mentioned the \"empowered patient\" concept and how we have been encouraged to learn about our diagnosis and actively participate in our ongoing care. Later that day, I was searching on Facebook and found this post from Mona (to the right). Mona still attends our meetings when she is available. She also participated in our annual Give Day challenge to help raise funds for vision research. I am so pleased that through a chance encounter on Facebook, a wonderful relationship has developed. I would like to thank Dr. James Brandt, for encouraging me to start this Glaucoma support group more than 10 years ago. I have learned so much from everyone who attends and am pleased to share my way of managing a support group with Mona. She will provide a wonderful service to her community, and we hope that this will be the beginning of worldwide support groups that provide a safe place for support and encouragement to all who are living with glaucoma. n\" So today was my first day attending a support group as a patient and when I sat down with myself afterword to reflect upon what had just happened, part of me was telling myself 'that would have really helped you back when you had your worst times of depression and anxiety and feeling invalidated all the time' which is why I want to start a support group and spread the idea. I have also loved the concept of the empowered patient and to search for a specialist who is treating me as a human and not as an illness. So thank you, Bonnie, for including me in your group and treating me with such kindness and grace.\" -Mona 2021https:/ /health.ucdavis.edu/eyecenter/ 68 67 enVision UC Davis Eye CenterOPTICAL SHOP Ask an Eye Center staff member today!
