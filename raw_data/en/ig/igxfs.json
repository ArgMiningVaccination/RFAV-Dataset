Unlike the acute care model of traditional western medicine, Functional Medicine does not apply a standard protocol to each problem. This is not \"one-size-fits-all\" medicine. Through the unique partnership between patient and doctor, Functional Medicine produces a comprehensive plan for maximizing the health of the individual. Beyond alleviating symptoms or slowing the progression of disease, the corrected imbalances and lifestyle changes resulting from the Functional approach promote wellness and vitality for the whole patient. Digestive Issues Many people begin to accept these problems as normal. However, prolonged or irregular issues with your gut and stomach could be the signs of serious digestive problems such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease, Celiac disease, food sensitivities/allergies leaky gut, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Furthermore, serious stomach issues can extend out beyond the digestive tract and can lead to issues in other parts of the body if it is not properly regulated. These digestive problems can cause systemic symptoms, even if the person is not showing digestive issues. These symptoms include joint pain, fatigue, weight gain, brain fog, and skin issues such as acne and rashes. Chronic Fatigue Chronic fatigue syndrome is a persistent, complex disorder characterized by extreme fatigue that cannot be explained by any specific medical condition and can be set off with even normal to low activity. Many people believe that having low energy is directly tied to the amount of sleep they receive each night. However, sufferers of chronic fatigue syndrome know that even when they get enough sleep, they will still feel the consequences of their condition. When symptoms persist even after a full night's rest, it can be an indicator that there is a more serious problem that is occurring. Signs of Chronic Fatigue Signs of chronic fatigue often include extreme tiredness throughout the day and following light movement or exercise. Other signs include short or long term memory loss, poor decision making, brain fog, and cognitive decline. The cause of chronic fatigue can vary, but the most common reasons include poor dietary choices, food allergies/sensitivities, adrenal dysfunction, or gastrointestinal issues. Other causes include a hidden infection, exposure to environmental toxins, poor detoxification capacity, and high stress Hormonal Imbalances At some point in our lives, most of us are faced with symptoms sparked by fluctuations in our hormones which causes imbalances.

The adrenal glands act like the emergency command and control center of your body\u2014similar to a 911 call operator. When we are faced with a stressful situation, a hormone called cortisol is produced by the adrenal glands and tells the rest of the body what to do in order to survive. When we face a stressor, cortisol shuts down fat burning to help us preserve energy, but it will give us a short burst of energy commonly known as an adrenaline rush. - Shut down the digestive tract - Stop the immune system from working properly - Affect other parts of the body such as the brain, thyroid gland, connective tissue, and sex glands in both men and women.
