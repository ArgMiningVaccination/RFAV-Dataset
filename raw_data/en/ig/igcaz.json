Ginkgo biloba has long been marketed as a supplement that boosts memory and helps concentration. But a study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association casts doubts on ginkgo's effectiveness. Study senior author Dr. Steven DeKosky of the University of Virginia medical school and his colleagues followed 3,069 people aged 72 to 96 who lived in communities in the U.S. between 2000 and 2008. About half of the participants were randomly assigned to take 120 milligrams of ginkgo biloba extract twice a day. The rest took an identical-looking placebo. \"We found that there was no effect of the ginkgo biloba on these clearly detectable changes in thinking function in late life,\" DeKosky said in a journal statement. The researchers found no evidence of an effect on memory, language and attention or on executive functions such as concentration, decision-making and problem solving. They also found no difference by age, sex, race, education or whether the person had normal or mild cognitive impairment when the study began. There was also no evidence that taking ginkgo led to any dangerous side-effects among the study participants. Useful herb Many previous studies on ginkgo were not long enough, not consistent or included too few participants, the researchers said. The findings didn't surprise naturopathic doctor Antonin Kodet, who says the effect of ginkgo biloba and other herbs have long been exaggerated by companies out to make a buck. \"How do you make money? You have to promote it. How do you promote it? You have to make it valid so you will say, 'It has been used for 2,000 years.'\" Still, ginkgo biloba can be a useful herb, Kodet insisted, as part of a treatment for a number of illnesses, including cardiovascular and adrenal problems. Most ginkgo studies have been funded by large drug companies that have a vested interest in getting people to take their medicines rather than natural products, said Stefan Kuprowsky, a naturopathic doctor in Vancouver. Ginkgo, in combination with other herbs, Kuprowsky said, makes some people feel more alert. DeKosky's study was funded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, the National Institute on Aging, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Roena Kulynych Center for Memory and Cognition Research, and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Schwabe Pharmaceuticals of Karlsruhe, Germany, donated the tablets and identical placebos. Several study authors reported ties to pharmaceutical companies. "}
