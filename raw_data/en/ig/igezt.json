The infection can cause genital warts and abnormal cells that are linked to cervical and other cancers. [The HPV vaccine](/uk/hpv-vaccine) can help protect you from the infection, although like with any vaccine or medication there are potential side effects. So, in this article we're going to look at those potential vaccine side effects and things to look out for. What is the HPV vaccine? The HPV vaccine is used to protect against 'high-risk' strains of HPV. There are around 100 strains of HPV, but only a handful of these are though to be 'high-risk' - these are the ones most likely to cause genital warts and certain cancers. The HPV vaccine we offer is [Gardasil 9](/uk/hpv-vaccine/gardasil-9-vaccine), which protects against nine strains of HPV. Two of the strains it protects against (16 and 18) cause [up to 70%](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cervical-cancer/risks-causes) of cervical cancer. It also protects against strains 6 and 11 which can cause [genital warts](/uk/sti-tests/what-are-genital-warts). The [vaccine is routinely offered](/uk/sexual-health-advice/who-can-get-a-free-hpv-vaccine) to children in Year 8, as part of the NHS' National Immunisation Programme. Anyone who was offered the vaccine in Year 8, but missed it, can get a catch-up course on the NHS. [Men who have sex with men](/uk/sexual-health-advice/why-the-hpv-vaccine-is-important-for-msm), and some transgender people can also get the vaccine on the NHS, up until the age of 45. Until recently, if you were 11-13 years old, you would get two doses of the vaccine, and those older would be offered three doses. But new evidence has found that two doses, given at the correct interval, can provide the [same amount of protection as three doses](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/single-dose-of-hpv-vaccine-jcvi-interim-advice/jcvi-interim-advice-on-a-one-dose-schedule-for-the-routine-hpv-immunisation-programme). Common HPV vaccine side effects As with any vaccination there can be side effects and the HPV injection is no exception. Side effects of the HPV vaccine are mostly temporary and occur around the part of your arm that you had the injection in. Of those who have the Gardasil 9 jab, more than [1 in 10 people ](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/hpv-vaccine-side-effects/) will experience the following side effects around the injection site: - Redness - Swelling - Pain These tend to be temporary and shouldn't last more than a couple of days. You may also experience headaches, but again these shouldn't last very long. If you are worried about side effects, you can always ask one of our pharmacists. Other common side effects include: - Headaches - Bruising or itching where you have been vaccinated - A fever or feeling hot and shivery - Feeling sick - Feeling pain in your fingers, hands, arms, toes, feet or legs - Dizziness or feeling faint If you think you will feel faint, ask to lie down for your injection and stay lying down for a short while afterwards. Rare side effects of the HPV vaccine It's thought that around [1 in 1000](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/hpv-vaccine-side-effects/) people getting the HPV jab will get hives (an itchy, red rash). And around 1 in 10000 people may experience difficulty breathing. These symptoms are allergic reactions. It's very rare that an allergic reaction occurs but if this happens your healthcare professional will know what to do. Does the HPV vaccine have any long-term side effects? The HPV vaccine has been widely used the UK, the US, Australia and Western Europe for many years and it has been concluded that the benefits of reducing certain cancers and genital warts outweigh any risks. To date there are [no known long-term side-effects](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/hpv-vaccine-safety/) or links to chronic diseases such as ME (chronic fatigue), complex regional pain syndrome, Guillan-Barre syndrome, premature ovarian failure or POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome). How to manage side effects from the HPV vaccine Most of the common HPV vaccine side effects will pass with time, and you might not need to do anything about them. If you have aches and pains, a headache or temperature, you could take some paracetamol to see if that helps. If you do have an allergic reaction, which is very rare, the healthcare professionals around you will know what to do. By and large people [recover fully within a couple of hours](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/hpv-vaccine-side-effects/). How long does HPV vaccine last? Once you've had your course of [HPV vaccines](/uk/hpv-vaccine), you will be protected, and you won't need any booster jabs. Studies have shown that the vaccine lasts for at least 10 years, but experts think that the protection can actually last much longer. Where can I get the HPV vaccine? As mentioned above, children in Year 8 are offered the HPV vaccine in school, free on the NHS. Anyone who was offered the vaccine in school, and missed them, can get a [catch-up course](/uk/sexual-health-advice/missed-your-hpv-vaccine) for free before they turn 25. Some transgender people and men who have sex with men can also get the vaccine for free until they're 45. You can check [your eligibility for a free NHS vaccine here](/uk/sexual-health-advice/hpv-vaccine-eligibility-check). If you don't fall into these categories, you can get the [HPV vaccine through our online service](/uk/hpv-vaccine). If approved by our clinicians, you'll be able to book the vaccine at your local LloydsPharmacy. If you had the Cervarix or Gardasil 4 HPV vaccine If you had a HPV vaccine through the NHS between 2008 and 2012 you would have received Cervarix, if you had one between 2012 and 2021 it was most likely Gardasil 4. From 2022 onwards you will most likely receive Gardasil 9. The protection you get from these vaccines is as follows: - Cervarix, Gardasil 4 and Gardasil 9 all protect you from HPV strains 16 and 18, which cause the majority of HPV-related cancers. - Gardasil 4 and Gardasil 9 will protect you against genital warts. - Gardasil 9 will also protect you against five additional high-risk strains of HPV, which can lead to cancer. If you've had Cervarix or Gardasil 4, you might feel like you would benefit from the extra protection of Gardasil 9, and this is something you can choose to do. There's no recommendations against getting a Gardasil 9 vaccine after having the Cervarix or Gardasil 4 vaccines initially, and currently there are no safety concerns reported. "}
