In order to achieve those objectives, the strategy proposes that the Member States \"building the (TCIM) knowledge base and formulating national policies \". The WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy proposes that Member States should strive to: - understand and recognize the role and possibilities of traditional and complementary medicine; and - strengthen the knowledge base, gather scientific evidence and preserve resources. In a survey conducted by WHO, Member States reported that one of the greatest difficulties they face is the lack of data in research. The United States is a research leader in TCIM. However, most countries in the Region of the Americas have not invested enough on strengthening national research capabilities. One of the purposes of this site is to build an useful collection of relevant academic resources for junior, senior and in-training researchers. Such resources are gathered, classified, and collected in this section. The TCIM Americas Network is working on developoing online courses and other relevant academic resources for TCIM researchers in the Region. Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine & Health The Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine & Health, is formed by more than 70 academic medical centers and associated institutions.

If your institution or project with academic resources in research in TCIM, is not in this list, please make us a [suggestion of content](http://mtci.bvsalud.org/en/contents-suggestion/). Research in Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine, and related practices (TCIM) requires the international scientific collaboration, to strengthen the development of capacities and training in research, as well as the construction of research methodologies adapted to the TCIM. Currently, there are different institutions, research teams and academic projects that promote research in the field of TCIM. These stakeholders have led to the creation of collaborative spaces, inter-institutional work, which has allowed the growth of the number and the quality of investigations in TCIM. Below is a list of institutions and projects that provide resources to strengthen research capabilities in MTCI.
