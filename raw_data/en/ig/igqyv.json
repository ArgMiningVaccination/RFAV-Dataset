I also use Acupoint Therapies. Patient care is a partnership between the patient, family and physician. I consider all factors that influence health, wellness and disease, including mind, body and spirit. My focus is on the whole person and being a partner in a patient's healing process. The human body and its functions are fascinating, and I loved my biology and science classes. Combining that with helping others is a win-win situation. I always loved kids and never even looked at specialties that didn't include children. Children keep you on your toes. They know what's trendy, are straight forward and don't beat around the bush. I love watching them grow and conquer tough times. Seeing the different personalities every day brings me endless joy! I was honored to be a scholar in the first cohort of the Integrative Oncology Scholarship program at the University of Michigan. This program laid the groundwork to start up the dedicated Integrative Oncology Service at Cincinnati Children's. I also won the Physician in Philanthropy Award in 2020, which allowed me to introduce Acupuncture therapies to Cincinnati Children's. In my free time, I love to travel, do crafts and cook. I play a lot of tennis and was a tennis coach for four- to eight-year-olds during high school and medical school. Cancer and Blood Diseases "}
