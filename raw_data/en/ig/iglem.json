We do things differently to stay safe from COVID-19. We stay in our homes a lot. We have to wear masks when we go out. It can be harder to get the services we need. How will things get back to normal? The COVID-19 vaccine will help! The COVID-19 vaccine is a shot that keeps people from getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 is especially dangerous to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities \u2014 but too often, the facts about COVID-19 are not shared in ways that are accessible to us. That's why ASAN has released this fact sheet about the COVID-19 vaccine. This fact sheet answers questions like: - Why should I get the COVID-19 vaccine? - What will getting the vaccine be like? - Is the vaccine safe? - When can I get the vaccine? - Do I still need to wear a mask after I get the vaccine? The COVID-19 Vaccine fact sheet is available in two versions: Our Easy Read Edition. The Easy Read version uses pictures along with large text, and has more white space.
