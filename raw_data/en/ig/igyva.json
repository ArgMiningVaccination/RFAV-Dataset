In the western US, prairie dog populations experience nearly 100% mortality during plague outbreaks, suggesting that multiple transmission pathways combine to amplify plague dynamics.

Carroll [ Further assessment of Monkeypox Virus infection in Gambian pouched rats (Cricetomys gambianus) vivo bioluminescent imaging ](/publications/further-assessment-monkeypox-virus-infection-gambian-pouched-rats-cricetomys-gambianus) Monkeypox is a zoonosis clinically similar to smallpox in humans. Recent evidence has shown a potential risk of increased incidence in central Africa. Despite attempts to isolate the virus from wild rodents and other small mammals, no reservoir host has been identified.

An oral sylvatic plague vaccine using the raccoon poxvirus vector (designated RCN-F1/V307) has been developed for prairie dogs. This vaccine is incorporated into palatable bait along with rhodamine B as a biomarker.
