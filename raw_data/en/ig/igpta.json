What is Naturopathy? Naturopathic physicians treat each individual by taking into account physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental and social factors. The principles of Naturopathy were first used by the Hippocratic School of Medicine in about 400 BC. The Greek philosopher Hippocrates believed in viewing the whole person in regards to finding a cause of disease, and using the laws of nature to induce cure. It was from this original school of thought that Naturopathy takes its principles. Naturopath is the last resort in a patient's long search for health. Providing personalised care to each patient, the naturopath sees humankind as a holistic unity of body, mind, and spirit. Using a range of alternative methods of diagnosis, a Naturopath can often successfully pin-point a predisposition in the body, before the onset of acute disease, and treat the patient with specific therapies and changes in the patient's lifestyle. The consulting Naturopath may then use Iridology (looking into the iris), or tongue diagnosis to get a better picture of the complete health state of the client. If needed, pathology testing such as hair, stool, or blood analysis may be recommended. Once all of the information is gathered, a treatment plan is formulated that addresses all areas of the person's life, providing the body with the optimum chance to heal itself. The treatment plan may include advice on diet, lifestyle, exercise, herbal medicine, homeopathic treatments, or other suitable remedies. A Naturopath may also refer the client to other practitioners as part of an integrated health care approach. What is Holistic Naturopathy and Herbalism? The term \"holistic\" is used a lot in the alternative medicine field and therapeutic methods and yoga styles. At Ronia Terra, we're approaching what we consider truly holistic naturopathy and herbalism. In our culture, people often think that taking vitamins and mineral supplements, homeopathic remedies or herbs means holistic medicine. But we think that it's not about what kind of medicine you give, but about how you give, whether it's a herb or a vitamin. Holistic is more about how you see people and plants and your perspective of the natural healing and how you ultimately see each person and plant with its unique healing needs. As much as we look at a whole person; its physical, spiritual & emotional well-being, we see a plant and its qualities as a whole. What does that mean? From our perspective, the energetics, the physical actions, and the spiritual essence of a plant are to see the whole. And we want to address each of those layers when working with a person and his/her mind, hearts, feelings, health constitution, to balance her/his ecosystem. The problem is when we don't look at the whole person's health qualities and add anti-remedies we miss the whole point of holistic medicine. It's a non-sustainable way of working but it can also be harmful when we don't look at the important energetics we have in front of us. Understanding both, we can see more deeply the missing puzzle piece, rather than apply just an anti-something for any-someone. With this way of working, we can access the cause of an imbalance, and work with missing elements for a long-term vitality to teach people about their unique nature and health. We think this is important to mention, as the health industry is making much money in dreamy promise-marketing which can not only be confusing and expensive, but also sometimes unfortunately harmful. The fundamentals of Holistic Naturopathy would never tell you to take any supplements or herbal medicines without knowing you.
