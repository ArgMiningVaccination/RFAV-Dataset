About 130 well-wishers celebrated, while hearing from dignitaries, and then toured the building located on the borough's east side on Wednesday. The newly renovated Family Center is the only one of its kind housing families and represents a significant milestone for Friends Association, an organization dedicated to providing comprehensive support and care for children and families who are experiencing homelessness. Families will find a welcoming and safe environment while accessing necessary services and resources. Six individual units, with separate entranceways, include kitchen and living spaces, with [trauma-informed renovations](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesnonprofitcouncil/2019/12/09/the-importance-of-trauma-informed-design/?sh=1b4f30c66785). A playground sits in the backyard. \"We are thrilled to unveil our newly renovated Family Center, a space updated with a trauma-informed design that will positively impact the lives of children and families who are experiencing homelessness in Chester County,\" said Jennifer Lopez, chief executive officer of Friends Association. Friends Association is unique. The organization focuses on keeping families together during times of crisis while connecting them with highly personalized case management, community resources, and skill-building. \"Our goal is to help people quiet the part of their brain that stays in survival mode when in a traditional shelter setting,\" Lopez said. \"Instead of feeling fearful and on high alert, they can focus on actions like looking for housing and helping their kids with homework. \"This building stands as a symbol of our continuing commitment to serve our community and our dream of a Chester County where everyone has a home.\" The first trauma-informed family shelter in Pennsylvania followed a three-year construction journey. \"This is a space that builds dignity, restores power, and promotes autonomy for families,\" Lopez said. \"We are the only low-barrier shelter to provide temporary housing for entire families of every makeup and demographic- we keep families together.\" President of the Chester County Board of Commissioners Marian Moskowitz told everyone assembled that the facility is a place of comfort and growth while noting that it is the only shelter in Chester County that serves families. President of the Friends Board and Chester County Clerk of Courts Yolanda van de Krol said the shelter is a welcoming spot and place where people can heal. \"Everybody deserves a really nice place to live,\" she said. \"It's terrible for children to see parents struggling and possibly losing their home.\" Mayor Lillian DeBaptiste said she was \"awestruck\" with the shelter. \"West Chester has said 'Yes' and created a safe haven,\" she said. \"Love abounds.\" State Rep. Chris Pielli talked about the housing crisis. \"It is inherently wrong to sit by and do nothing,\" he said. Dolores Colligan, director of the Chester County Department of Community Development, said that the shelter, with a more than $1 million price tag, was a worthwhile investment to keep families housed so they don't experience trauma. Pastor Ann Dickey of First Presbyterian Church gave the blessing. \"Bless especially the children, may they know we love and hope,\" she said. For more than a decade, the Family Center has provided more than 120,000 nights of shelter to over 300 families experiencing the trauma of homelessness. The following organizations pitched in: Chester County Commissioners and the Department of Community Development; Crystal Trust; Senator Carolyn Comitta; and Quest for the Best. Dedicated spaces were supported by the Marinelli Family, the Vogt Family, and the family of Beverly Maxwell. The architect was JL Architects and the contractor was Weldon Builders \u2014 Clint Weldon and Luke Butler. \"As many of you know, this week is my last at Friends Association and it is fitting that I end my journey where it began in 2019...sitting on this very porch,\" Lopez said. \"I remember being filled with hope about all of the possibilities to make this an environment that would help families heal and recover both mentally "}
