The UNM Health Sciences Center compiles this annual report to provide policymakers and the public with a county-by-county snapshot of New Mexicans' health status . T he report draws on data provided by our partners in the New Mexico Department of Health and County Health Councils . It also details the many activities conducted by HSC colleges, the UNM Health System and programs we operate in communities throughout the state . T hese activities reflect areas of focus that in our view will lead to the greatest improvements in health status for New Mexicans . They include addressing the health care workforce shortage, child well-being, healthy aging and behavioral health and substance use disorder . W hile these report cards highlight health care success stories, they also underscore serious ongoing challenges that continue to face many of our communities . I hope that the information presented here will be of assistance in helping to craft effective solutions . W ith Warm Regards, Paul B . Roth, MD, MS Chancellor for Health Sciences CEO, UNM Health System Dean, UNM School of Medicine UNM President Garnett S . Stokes seldom misses an opportunity to remind us that we must aspire to become the University for New Mexico . This vision is reflected in the growing responsiveness of UNM's colleges and departments, who are working together to respond to the priority health and social needs of New Mexico communities . T he UNM Health Sciences Center is collaborating with Architecture and Planning, Engineering, Education, Law and Business in a program called HIVE (Health, Inclusion, Vibrancy & Equity) . Working together, they address such needs as transportation for rural veterans; health, social and legal services at a homeless shelter; teacher training for rural public schools; family medicine resident training at the U . S . /Mexico border; and providing safe and clean rest rooms at public parks . T he Health Sciences Center can be proud of the many initiatives linking campus and community, including such models as the Transdisciplinary Research, Equity and Engagement Center; the New Mexico Nursing Education Consortium; the New Mexico Poison & Drug Information Center and Project ECHO . UNM's Office for Community Health is continuing to build a community- and campus-based network of resources to better serve our state . We collaborate with all of the university's colleges and hospitals to strengthen this resource . Health Extension Regional Officers (HEROs), Area Health Education Centers and our community health worker programs are other examples of the Health Sciences Center's reach into our communities . T his year, we are also featuring the community-oriented research work generated by the Clinical & Translational Sciences Center and the nationally unique and growing Project ACCESS, which uses telemedicine technology to help rural hospital physicians remotely manage acute stroke and head injury, thereby sharply reducing the cost of preventable transports .

HEROS IN YOUR COMMUNITY: Sample Accomplishments NORTHWESTNORTH NORTHEASTCOLFAX NORTH SOUTHWEST SOUTHGUADALUPE SOUTHEASTBERNALILLOOFFICE FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH - COUNTY HEALTH REPORT CARDS 3 The University of New Mexico Clinical & Translational Science Center (CTSC) helps transform scientific discovery into improved health by enabling high-quality clinical and translational research locally, regionally and nationally . The CTSC has created a research ecosystem that provides critical services and training, develops and disseminates processes to support research and builds new partnerships . Taken together, these initiatives substantially grew the UNM Health Sciences Center's research enterprise and its impact, building on local strengths and addressing New Mexico's geographic and demographic needs . Our community engagement platform enables bi-directional communication with communities and sharing of clinical and translational research with a wide array of stakeholders . We have implemented innovative strategies such as the Community Engagement and Research Core (CERC) and the Community Health Network (CHN) to increase access to clinical trials in communities around the state - with a focus on rural communities . For example, the CHN employs community health workers trained and hired from within the community who collaborate with community health specialists, enabling the CTSC to solicit community participation and input in health research . The growth and cumulative impact of the CTSC's community engagement activity is clear: the number of cumulative projects supported by the CERC grew from two in 2012 when it was formed to 21 in 2019 . The percentage of underserved participants in research projects grew during the same period . Participants age 64 and older grew from five percent in 2015 to 23 percent in 2018 . Native American participants increased from four percent in 2015 to 10 UNM HEAL TH SCIENCES CENTER FEATURED PROGRAM: The Clinical & Translational Science Center percent in 2018, and participants living in rural areas increased from one percent in 2015 to 14 percent in 2018 . This growth is significant, because participant enrollment in studies must represent the entire population, with ample inclusion of underserved populations and the diseases that affect them . The CTSC also spearheaded an institution-wide support unit for initial grant training, identification of grant opportunities, facilitating new interdisciplinary team formation and facilitating grant submissions . We have had unprecedented success with Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) funding opportunities from the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) . Of 201 ACA-related grant applications submitted since 2012, 115 (57%) were awarded, for a total of $85 million . These awards included PCORI grants totaling $11 .3 million and CMS Innovation grants totaling $29 .2 million . In addition to their fiscal impact, these awards have catalyzed new researcher and clinician teams with New Mexico communities, because many of the grants were obtained in collaboration with community partners . These projects have helped reduce high-dose opioid prescriptions by 11% in 2018 and increased hepatitis C treatment 10-fold between 2014 and 2018 . The CTSC will continue to play a key role in broadening access to rural care and addressing key health issues . Our community-engaged approach bolsters inclusion in research studies and will improve health among special populations . n4 OFFICE FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH - COUNTY HEALTH REPORT CARDSA stroke is a medical emergency wherever it occurs, but people living in rural New Mexico are especially at risk, because they often live far from doctors with the expertise to diagnose and treat the condition in a timely fashion . But thanks to ACCESS (Access to Critical Cerebral Emergency Support Services) Telemedicine, a nonprofit program operated by The University of New Mexico Hospital, stroke patients in rural hospitals throughout the state can receive state-of-the-art diagnoses of their conditions on the spot . ACCESS Telemedicine, launched in 2015 with the help of a three- year $15 .2 million grant from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, enables physicians in rural emergency departments to consult with specialists at UNM Hospital via a dedicated telemedicine connection . UNM doctors can review neuroimaging results and even interview the patients or their family members via a video link .UNM HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER FEATURED PROGRAM: Project ACCESS The program charges rural hospitals only for the consults they need, a significant savings over the 24/7 coverage provided by commercial stroke consult services . UNMH doctors also can determine when the best course for a patient is to remain in the local ER, rather than be flown to Albuquerque for surgical intervention . In its first three years, the program served more than 4,000 patients and eliminated $24 million in annual medical costs, in part by avoiding unneeded emergency air transport, which can cost $40,000 per patient transfer . The program keeps more patients - and their families - in their home communities, which also benefits local hospitals . ACCESS Telemedicine has gained the support of physicians in rural and community hospitals throughout New Mexico and won endorsement from insurers, who have found a way to reduce needless expense . nOFFICE FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH - COUNTY HEALTH REPORT CARDS 5 Bernalillo County QUICK FACTS Bernalillo County N.M.
