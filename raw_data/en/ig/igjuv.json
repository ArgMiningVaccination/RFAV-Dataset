As part of that commitment, we are pleased to share with you this seventh annual edition of our Patient Treatment Results. Cancer Treatment Centers of America\u00ae (CTCA) was among the first cancer care providers in the nation to make treatment results available to the general public, and, to our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive presentation of treatment results now published by any cancer care provider. It reflects the quality of clinical care we have provided to patients from around the world at our comprehensive care and research centers and outpatient care centers in Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Tulsa. Five-year survival rates for CTCA\u00ae patients treated between 2000 and 2015 are provided for 11 cancer types. For reference, we have also provided companion data for the same cancer types and timeframe as reported by the National Cancer Institute in its Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program, which is undertaken in collaboration with the American College of Surgeons and American Cancer Society. The CTCA patient survival data appearing in this publication were independently analyzed and interpreted by Bert Spilker, MD, PhD, and Chengjie Xiong, PhD. Their biographical sketches are included in this publication. Neither is affiliated with, or employed by, CTCA. Additionally, we have included data on various safety and quality of care measurements during treatment, critically important results not commonly reported by most cancer providers, as well as patient self-reports of quality of life and the overall patient experience. All data sources and survey methodologies are provided in their respective sections throughout the publication. We hope you find this important information valuable, and we would be pleased to respond to any feedback or questions you may have about the results. Thank you for your interest in Cancer Treatment Centers of America. Sincerely, Maurie Markman, MD President, Medicine & Science Cancer Treatment Centers of America \u00a9 2019 IPBOur Vision To be recognized and trusted by people living with cancer as the premier center for healing and hope.

We believe patients deserve access to information\u2014especially health outcomes, including survival, patient safety and quality care data as well as patient self-reported data on care experience and symptom management. When patients have access to information about the centers and professionals to whom they entrust their lives, they are able to make more informed decisions about their care. OUR COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY At CTCA\u00ae, we believe that transparency in the publication of our treatment results is vital to upholding our promise to patients and their families. Regardless of the outcome, it holds us accountable to continually improve the care we deliver. We engage leading independent research organizations, such as Bert Spilker & Associates, LLC, Press Ganey\u00ae and Healthcare Performance Improvement (HPI\u00ae) to conduct various analyses of our treatment results. We utilize valid and tested tools and participate in nationally recognized activities to further our commitment to safe, high- quality care for the patients we serve. OUR BEGINNINGS In the early 1980s, Richard J Stephenson and his family suffered the loss of their mother, Mary Brown Stephenson, to cancer. When she died, her grieving son and his family asked, \"What would it take to actually change the face of cancer care?\" In 1988, CTCA was born, founded on what is now known as the Mother Standard\u00ae of care\u2014a patient- centered approach that combines compassion with advanced technology and treatment options. The American International Hospital in Zion, Illinois, located between Chicago and Milwaukee, served as the first CTCA location. With Mr. Stephenson as chairman of the board, the cancer program became one of the first in the country to offer a full range of integrative treatment services, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy as well as nutrition, mind-body and spiritual support. In 1990, CTCA opened a second hospital, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, establishing itself as a premier center of hope and healing for cancer patients. As demand grew, the CTCA hospital in Zion was expanded twice. In 1991, CTCA broke ground on a five-story, 78,886-square-foot facility. Then in 2015, a six-story 168,078-square-foot inpatient tower became the centerpiece of a campus-wide modernization. CTCA also expanded its presence in Tulsa by opening a state-of-the-art hospital in 2005. The stunning 195,845-square-foot center became Oklahoma's only major hospital completely focused on treating cancer. Also in 2005, CTCA Philadelphia opened its doors, becoming the first CTCA hospital on the East Coast. CTCA Phoenix, a modern 210,000-square-foot hospital located in Goodyear, Arizona (suburban Phoenix) joined the CTCA family in 2008. In 2012, CTCA Atlanta began welcoming patients to its location in suburban Newnan. Building on the goal of offering patients increased access to advanced cancer therapies and personalized care in convenient, cost-effective outpatient settings, in 2018 and 2019 CTCA opened five outpatient care centers in Chicago, Phoenix and their surrounding communities.

At CTCA, each patient is served by a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, registered dietitians and other care providers. These teams include individuals with extensive experience in treating cancer. Together they develop and implement an individualized treatment plan tailored to each patient's unique diagnosis and life goals. For these reasons, patients, physicians, employers and insurers can depend on CTCA to offer comprehensive, compassionate and truly personalized cancer care. Accessibility, Services and Insurance: Reducing the Stress of Cancer Care ACCESSIBILITY CTCA understands that speed and accessibility of care are important to patients and their caregivers, which is why we are dedicated to providing efficient, convenient cancer care for our patients while reducing their stress as much as possible. CTCA Comprehensive Cancer Care Network hospitals and outpatient care centers are located in or near five major U.S. cities: Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Tulsa. Each city has an airport that is serviced by most major airlines. We assist many patients with travel arrangements, including lodging accommodations for themselves, their caregivers and families either on-site at our hospitals or in nearby hotels. HEAL TH INSURANCE AND VERIFICATION CTCA verifies the insurance and benefits of prospective patients, including in-network and out-of-network benefits, deductibles, plan coverage percentages and co-pays. The verification process typically takes less than 24 hours. CTCA financial counselors are also available to patients and caregivers should they need assistance with the financial arrangements for their care. CTCA maintains contracts with many major national and regional insurance companies, employers and other health care companies that have approved patient access to CTCA hospitals. We treat patients who have both in-network and out-of- network benefits with these carriers. 4 5 CTCA Patient Treatment Results 2019 | 2020 Analytic and Non-Analytic New Patients BY AGE GROUP Analytic and Non-Analytic 9,192 5,1124,080 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 30002,862 1,3833,02115 224 1,067 138482 New Patients Analytic and Non-Analytic New Patients BY AGE GROUP Analytic and Non-Analytic 9,192 5,1124,080 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 30002,862 1,3833,02115 224 1,067 138482 New Patients 269 1882,879CTCA Patient Demographics JULY 1, PR 1Cancer Types BY STAGE Analytic Patients 807 801 119 Stage 0 Patients BY STATE OR TERRITORY Analytic and Non-Analytic PR 1Cancer Types BY STAGE Analytic Patients 807 801 119 Stage 0 Patients BY STATE OR TERRITORY Analytic and Non-Analytic PR 1Cancer Types BY STAGE Analytic Patients 807 801 119 Stage 0 Analytic and Non-Analytic New Patients BY AGE GROUP Analytic and Non-Analytic 9,192 5,1124,080 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 30002,862 1,3833,02115 224 1,067 138482 New Patients 166 3141,066 2305461,132 269 1882,879Patient demographics are based on data provided by the tumor registry from July 1, 2017 - June 30, 2018. 1 The overall patient population includes patients evaluated across all CTCA hospitals, including those who received non-cancer directed therapy or received palliative care only. 2 Analytic patients are those who are diagnosed and/or received all or part of their first course of cancer treatment at CTCA.

Our efforts employed the statistical guidelines that govern these types of analyses by leading practitioners. Although the lack of direct comparability of the two data sets imposes certain limitations on the interpretation of the results as stated elsewhere in this publication, we believe the analyses provide an accurate representation of survival rates for CTCA\u00ae patients. Sincerely, Bert Spilker, PhD, MD Chengjie Xiong, PhDOur Length of Life Results Bert Spilker & Associates, LLC, an independent health care consulting firm, produced the study design for the analyses and interpretation of the data. After reviewing data sources, the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) comparison sample was chosen by matching basic characteristics (e.g., categories or range of values) on several of the most important factors that affect survival outcomes. The analyses of both the CTCA and SEER samples only include cancer patients with one of 11 cancer types whose initial diagnosis occurred between 2000 and 2015. The graphs on the following pages illustrate the findings.SECTION 2 SPOTLIGHT BERT SPILKER, PHD, MD Bert Spilker, PhD, MD, is the founder of Bert Spilker & Associates, LLC (BS&A), a health care consulting company working with more than 100 health care clients and contracting with over 150 experts on a variety of research areas of specialization.

LUNG CANCER CTCA Chicago \"My medical oncologist talked to me about immunotherapy. I hadn't heard of this option before. I soon found out that immunotherapy uses the body's immune system to fight cancer cells. I did about six weeks of immunotherapy, and I immediately knew it was working. It's amazing to me that my own body can be used to identify and fight the bad cells. I am still in active treatment and continuing immunotherapy.\" No case is typical. You should not expect to experience these results.Statistical Methodology DATA SELECTION Two databases were considered for this study. The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database and the National Cancer Database (NCDB). The SEER database is an authoritative data set created for use as an epidemiological tool to monitor the incidence and mortality of cancer in the United States. SEER collects patient demographics, tumor characteristics and survival data from 17 regional registries throughout the U.S., representing 28 percent of the U.S. population. The NCDB compiles cancer registry data from cancer programs in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, capturing approximately 75% of newly diagnosed cancers in these areas. It includes data on patient characteristics, tumor staging, tumor histology, type of first treatment, disease recurrence and survival using standardized coding definitions. It is commonly used to guide quality improvement and pursue investigator-initiated research questions. The NCDB provides insight into analytic cancer diagnoses and primary treatments. The main limitation of the data is that the cohorts are not population-based; they are identified from the hospitals at which the patients presented for diagnosis and/or treatment. The SEER database was selected to conduct these analyses because of its comprehensive content and access to patient-level data (and because of restrictions imposed on the use of the NCDB database for comparative analysis and external reporting purposes). The SEER comparison sample was chosen by the categories in categorical factors (e.g., cancer stages) with the CTCA cancer cohort and selecting the overlapping ranges in continuous factors (e.g., age at diagnosis) from the CTCA cancer cohort. These factors affect survival outcomes. The SEER Limited-Use Database (2016) was used to select the SEER comparison sample. The final survival analyses included only patients from both the CTCA and SEER databases whose following cancer characteristics were available from the two databases: SEER Summary Stages, primary tumor sites, cancer histologic types, gender and age at initial diagnosis. For example, if a specific SEER Summary Stage had only patients in one database, none of these patients was used in the analyses. To match the age at initial diagnosis, the range (i.e., minimum and maximum ages) was computed for each sample. Only patients whose age at initial diagnosis fell into the overlap of the two ranges from the CTCA and SEER samples were included in the comparative survival analyses. METHODOLOGY For both the CTCA and SEER samples, only cancer patients whose initial diagnosis occurred between 2000 and 2015 were analyzed. Cancer cases with missing information on either the date of initial diagnosis or date of last contact were deleted from the CTCA database because the survival time or censoring time for such patients could not be computed. Cancer patients with missing SEER Summary Stages were also excluded from the analyses. For patients with multiple cancers in the SEER and CTCA databases, only the first or primary cancer diagnosed was used for the survival comparisons. Patients with a histologic code (ICD-O-3) between 9590 and 9989 were excluded from the analyses because these histologic types are generally not included by SEER for any non- hematopoietic cancer types. Patients who did not receive treatment from CTCA were also excluded from the analyses. The survival outcomes from the SEER database were provided by the SEER Limited-Use Data File as the number of completed months. These numbers were then converted to the number of years by dividing the number of total months by 12. Although the exact dates for the initial diagnosis and death were available in the CTCA database, the CTCA survival outcomes were computed using the same methodology as the SEER database; the number of completed months was computed by first dividing the exact days from the initial diagnosis to death, or last contact for those who remained alive, by 365.24 (as was done by SEER), then rounding down to the number of completed months, and finally dividing the result by 12. For those patients who were still alive or lost to follow-up at the time of entering the databases, survival time was treated as statistically censored at the difference between the date of last contact and the date of initial diagnosis.1The survival curve for each cancer type (defined as the probability of a cancer patient's survival as a function of time from the initial diagnosis) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier nonparametric product-limit estimator. 1 Three statistical tests were then used to compare the survival curves between the CTCA database and the SEER database. Two of these tests, the log rank test and Wilcoxon test, are nonparametric and thus, valid to compare survival curves that have any shapes.1 These tests are different, however, in their sensitivity (or the power) to detect survival differences. The log rank test is considered the most sensitive or powerful when the risk or the hazard of death between CTCA and SEER samples is approximately proportional, whereas the Wilcoxon test tends to be more sensitive when the ratio of hazards of death is higher at earlier times than at later ones. The third test, the likelihood ratio test, is the most restrictive of the three in the sense that it is appropriate to use only for special survival curves (called exponential distributions) whose hazards of death are constant across time.2 Ninety-five percent confidence interval (95% CI) estimates for the individual survival rates, as well as the difference in survival rates between the CTCA and SEER samples at specific time points after diagnosis, were based on the estimated survival curves and the relevant asymptotic normal distributions. All these analyses were implemented using the standard SAS package of statistical tests (i.e., SAS/PROC LIFETEST).3 Adjusted analyses were also done (results not shown) using the stratified log rank test and the Wilcoxon test as well as Cox's proportional hazards models to compare the survival outcomes between the CTCA and SEER samples after adjusting for the effects of age at diagnosis, gender (except for breast and prostate cancers), race, marital status at diagnosis, insurance status at diagnosis and year of initial diagnosis. The technical details of these statistical analyses are available from CTCA. 1 Kalbfleisch JD, Prentice RL. The Statistical Analysis of Failure Time Data. New York: John Wiley, 1980. 2 Lawless JF.

Cary, NC, USA. 11 OUR LENGTH OF LIFE RESULTS 10 CTCA Patient Treatment Results 2019 | 2020LIMITATIONS Direct statistical comparisons of survival outcomes between groups of cancer patients have limitations because of the possible confounding effects of other factors cited below and elsewhere in this report. Accordingly, the data appearing in this report should be considered directional, not definitive. First, although a large sample of patients was available from the SEER Program across many geographic regions in the U.S., both samples, including the sample from CTCA, are convenience samples. This precludes the assumption of a causal interpretation of the statistical inferences. Second, although some types of matching, as described earlier, were implemented to select the appropriate SEER and CTCA comparison samples, the distributions of important covariates, such as age at initial diagnosis, gender, race, marital status at diagnosis, insurance status at diagnosis and year of initial diagnosis, were not exactly the same between the CTCA sample and SEER sample. Hence, even with the adjusted analyses, possible confounding of these factors to the analyses and results may not be ruled out. Further, many factors (e.g., household income, mobility, etc.) other than those considered in the analyses and available from the databases may have contributed to the actual survival outcomes. As a result of these factors, the possible confounding of the results of these analyses may not be ruled out. Finally, the survival analyses were based on the statistical comparisons of the rate of death from all possible causes, not solely cancer-specific death. These data are not included in the CTCA data set and, therefore, not available for statistical comparison.

Between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2019, more than 8,692 patients completed both baseline and return self-assessments. Graphs on pages 27-31 reflect a change in score for patients by cancer type who self-reported at least one symptom as severe at baseline in comparison to their return visit. Graphs on pages 32 and 33 reflect CTCA aggregate and facility patient self-reported outcome data for five (5) key areas across cancer types. Assessment Background and Methodology Cancer Treatment Centers of America\u00ae (CTCA) was among the first U.S. cancer hospitals to use quality of life metrics as part of its routine assessment of patient well-being and quality of care. Research demonstrates Patient Self-Reported Outcome (PSRO) data are a valuable part of a patient's treatment plan. Several studies validate the potential of routine assessment data in improving both the precision and degree of patient- centered care - making sure the right care is delivered to the right patients at the right time. The benefits of PSRO data not only include better health-related quality of life and fewer emergency room visits, but also improvements in health service outcomes and survival.1,2,3 CTCA\u00ae patients self-report their symptoms and quality of life concerns as part of our patient evaluation process. This process includes a symptom assessment, called the Symptom Inventory Tool (SIT), that patients complete in correspondence with their treatment cycle, not more frequently than every 21 days. Upon arrival, patients complete the electronically administered SIT using a tablet computer. CTCA team members utilize these results as part of their patient assessment and evaluation process. These two complementary processes (patient self-assessment and reflection, and analyzing the data as a starting point for discussion) help CTCA care teams readily identify when patients may benefit from referral and/or more directed intervention to help them cope with their symptoms, side effects and quality of life concerns. The data also exist real-time within the electronic health record. More than 94 percent of patients voluntarily participate in the SIT assessments. 1 Basch E, Deal AM, Kris MG, et al: Symptom monitoring with patient-reported outcomes during routine cancer treatment: A randomized controlled trial.

These 19 questions mirror the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) tool used by many U.S. hospitals. MDASI, which assesses both the severity and impact of patients' symptoms and quality of life issues, has been psychometrically validated and tested. It is also endorsed by the National Cancer Institute. CTCA has added eight (8) questions to the patient assessment process that our medical and care teams consider clinically relevant (box 3). The graphs on the following pages illustrate CTCA patients' self-reported symptom burden for nine (9) key areas by type of cancer for patients at their new patient evaluation (baseline) in comparison to their next return visit when scoring a particular symptom or activity area as severe at baseline. For patients with severe baseline scores (7 or greater on a 0 to 10 scale with 0 being \"non-existent\" and 10 being \"as bad as one can imagine/greatly interfered\"), a two-point change in score is clinically relevant and significant, with respect to the symptom getting better, remaining constant or getting worse.

The inpatient survey data reported in this section were gathered between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019 and represent a total of 1,045 completed HCAHPS surveys across all CTCA locations. The Press Ganey National Cohort includes 2,790 acute care hospitals and the Top Peer Oncology Provider cohort includes 11 cancer specialty hospitals. The outpatient ambulatory surgery survey data reported in this section were gathered between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019. CTCA patients completed 1,595 Outpatient and Ambulatory Surgery Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (OAS CAHPS) surveys over the course of 12 months. The Press Ganey National Cohort includes 2,938 hospital outpatient surgery departments and ambulatory surgery centers. The outpatient survey data reported in this section were gathered between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019 and represent a total of 11,463 completed outpatient oncology surveys across all CTCA locations. The Press Ganey National Cohort includes 379 oncology centers and the Top Peer Oncology Provider cohort includes 16 cancer specialty hospitals. CTCA employs a Physician Transparency Star Rating program to provide greater insight into the quality of patients' experiences with our medical oncologists, radiation oncologists and gynecologic oncologists. The data, collected between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019, are an aggregation of two questions specific to physicians' patient care using the outpatient satisfaction survey.HCAHPS Inpatient Survey Background and Methodology Cancer Treatment Centers of America\u00ae (CTCA) participates in and monitors its ratings on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey, developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and is administered by a third party, Press Ganey\u00ae. The HCAHPS survey is a national, standardized, publicly-reported survey of patients' perspectives on their inpatient hospital care. Until HCAHPS, many hospitals collected information on patient satisfaction for their own internal use, with no national standard for collecting and publicly reporting information about patient experience of care that allowed valid comparisons to be made across hospitals locally, regionally and nationally. Through the relationship that CTCA\u00ae has with Press Ganey, a nationally recognized, independent third party, surveys are administered to all eligible adult patients between 48 hours and six weeks after their discharge from a CTCA hospital. Press Ganey works with more than 26,000 healthcare organizations and is considered an industry leader. As a result of our strategic relationship with Press Ganey, CTCA has access to the largest comparative database containing real-time data from more hospitals than any other HCAHPS vendor in the nation. 35 OUR PATIENT EXPERIENCE RESULTS Ninette R. | OVARIAN CANCER | CTCA Atlanta No case is typical. You should not expect to experience these results.\"I worked with my doctor to decide on a personalized cancer treatment plan. The doctor took time to explain my options to me. She was honest, caring and very detailed, which is exactly what I needed. I experienced some side effects [from chemotherapy], such as nausea, constipation and fatigue.

Additional details on the HCAHPS inpatient survey questions can be found in the key on page 41. In alignment with the CTCA commitment to the Mother Standard\u00ae of care, our hospitals' patient experience results are consistently higher than the national and regional norms.CTCA Inpatient Satisfaction Results Overall, when patients are asked if they would recommend a CTCA hospital to family and friends as well as whether they considered their experience with CTCA as among the best hospitals, with 1,045 completed responses, our hospitals ranked within the top 3% of hospitals across the nation using data from July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019. THE MOTHER STANDARD \u00ae OF CARE The Mother Standard of care is a philosophy that makes the following promise: CTCA physicians, clinicians and stakeholders will provide patients with the same warmth, unconditional support and respect that we would extend to our own mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers and loved ones. In adhering to the Mother Standard of care, we give people fighting cancer new options, hope and an improved quality of life.98th Percentile97th Percentile 1 The HCAHPS survey compiles nationwide data, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) adjusts for geographic region and certain patient demographics. As such, the results appearing on the CMS website (http://www.medicare.gov/ hospitalcompare/search.html) are delayed in being released to the public. Therefore, data from patients surveyed in this timeframe will not appear on the CMS website for approximately one year, and may differ slightly. 2 The Top 11 Peer Oncology Providers include: City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Moffitt Cancer Center, James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, University of Miami Hospital and USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. 37 OUR PATIENT EXPERIENCE RESULTS 36 CTCA Patient Treatment Results 2019 | 2020CTCA ALL HOSPITALS | HCAHPS Survey on Inpatient Satisfaction Providers Press Ganey NationalPercent of Patients Percent of PatientsCTCA Phoenix Press Ganey Regional Press Ganey National Our Patient Experience Results INPATIENT | JULY 1, 2018 - JUNE 30, 2019Our Patient Experience Results INPATIENT | JULY 1, 2018 - JUNE 30, 2019 CTCA ATLANTA | HCAHPS Survey on Inpatient Satisfaction | 321 Completed SurveysCTCA CHICAGO | HCAHPS Survey on Inpatient Satisfaction | 328 PatientsCTCA Atlanta Press Ganey Regional Press Ganey National CTCA Tulsa PatientsCTCA Philadelphia Press Ganey Regional Press Ganey National CTCA Survey on Inpatient Satisfaction | PatientsCTCA Philadelphia Press Ganey Regional Press Ganey National CTCA OUR PATIENT EXPERIENCE RESULTS 38 CTCA Patient Treatment Results 2019 | 2020Our Patient Experience Results INPATIENT | JULY 1, 2018 - JUNE 30, 2019 GRAPH LABELS SURVEY QUESTIONS (AND DOMAINS) (1) Recommend Patients who would definitely recommend their hospital to friends and family (2) Nurses Nurses treated you with courtesy and respect Nurses listened carefully to you Nurses explained in a way you understood (3) Doctors Doctors treated you with courtesy and respect Doctors listened carefully to you Doctors explained in a way you understood (4) Received help After using call button, received help as soon as you wanted it Received help with toileting as soon as you wanted it (5) Pain Staff talked about how much pain you had Staff talked about how to treat your pain (6) Medicine Told you what new medicine was for Staff described medicine side effects (7) Environment Cleanliness of hospital environment (8) Quiet Quietness of hospital environment (9) Discharge Staff talked about whether you had help when you left Staff provided Information regarding symptoms or problems to look for (10) Care transitions Hospital staff took preferences into account Good understanding of managing own health Understood purpose of taking medicine (11) Overall Patients who rated their hospital 9 or 10 on a scale from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest) HCAHPS SURVEY KEY CTCA TULSA | HCAHPS Survey on Inpatient Satisfaction | PatientsCTCA Atlanta Press Ganey Regional Press Ganey National CTCA Tulsa Press Ganey Regional Press Ganey NationalCTCA PHOENIX | HCAHPS Survey on Inpatient Satisfaction | Surveys Providers Press Ganey NationalPercent of Patients Percent of PatientsCTCA Phoenix Press Ganey Regional Press Ganey National 41 OUR PATIENT EXPERIENCE RESULTS 40 CTCA Patient Treatment Results 2019 | 2020Our Patient Experience Results OUTPATIENT AND AMBULATORY SURGERY | JULY 1, 2018 - JUNE 30, 2019Our Patient Experience Results OUTPATIENT AND AMBULATORY SURGERY | JULY 1, 2018 - JUNE 30, 2019 405060708090100 Press Ganey National CTCAPercent of Patients Percent 83.393.9 85.7 405060708090100 405060708090100 Press Ganey National CTCA94.2 83.393.9 85.7Patients who gave their FACILITY A RATING OF 9 OR 10 on a scale from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest)Patients who reported YES, they would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THEIR FACILITY CTCA ranks in the 94th percentile among the 2,938 hospitals in the Press Ganey National cohort.

This program provides greater insight into the quality of patients' experiences with CTCA medical oncologists, radiation oncologists and gynecologic oncologists. The data displayed on the CTCA website (cancercenter.com) are aggregations of two questions specific to physicians' patient care using the outpatient satisfaction survey. Data from the answers to the two questions are collected by Press Ganey and converted by Binary Fountain into a one to five-star rating, with one star being the lowest possible rating and five stars being the highest. Once a minimum of 30 responses is received by a physician, results are made available online. All patient comments are also posted online as written by the patient, whether they are positive or negative, after being de-identified for confidentiality and patient privacy. The average star rating for CTCA physicians is 4.80 out of 5.0, which is based upon a volume of 6,150 ratings among 46 individual physicians over the course of 12 months. This is above the 4.57 average national star rating of other hospitals in the research organization's database. The distribution of star ratings across CTCA physicians is reflected below with 78.3% of CTCA physicians rated 4.8 stars or above on the 5-star scale. The data below reflect ratings collected between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019.

CTCA has embraced principles consistent with the establishment of a \"high reliability organization\" utilizing evidence-based strategies to mitigate the risk of preventable harm. CTCA hospitals utilize the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Hospital Survey on the Culture of Patient Safety, last completing this survey in 2019. All five CTCA hospitals are among the just over 300 U.S.-based oncology practices that have achieved three- year Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI) certification conferred by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. This certification recognizes select oncology practices that achieve a minimum overall composite quality score of 75% and comply with 28 safety standards.Our Philosophy and Methodology COLLABORATIVE, RELIABLE PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS At Cancer Treatment Centers of America\u00ae (CTCA), quality care does not simply happen, it is built and nurtured. Quality is the outcome of a set of consciously designed, reliable procedures and systems that connect people, processes, knowledge and technology in the delivery of high quality, safe care. The CTCA\u00ae quality program is grounded in the following principles: Collaborative partnerships across CTCA are essential to individual and collective improvement. Improvement and clinical innovation is achieved through the conscious deployment of methodologies, technologies and tools. Evidence-based practice, guidelines and/ or expert opinion are central to learning and transferring knowledge. Providers and patients alike are empowered to serve as champions for improvement. CTCA utilizes the six aims of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) as a framework for our definition of quality care. According to these aims, health care should be: 1. SAFE: Avoid injuries to patients from the care intended to help them. 2. EFFECTIVE: Base patient services on scientific, evidence-based knowledge of the benefits. 3. PATIENT-CENTERED: Provide care in a respectful manner that is responsive to individual preferences, needs and values. 4. TIMELY: Reduce waits and delays for both those who receive and those who give care. 5. EFFICIENT: Avoid waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas and energy. 6. EQUITABLE: Be consistent in the quality of care, which should not vary due to individual differences such as gender, age, race/ethnicity, geographic location or socio-economic status. No case is typical. You should not expect to experience these results.\"At CTCA, my care team discovered that I actually had two types of cancers: a high-grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason 6. I was extremely fortunate to have caught it early, and that the cancer had not spread beyond my bladder and prostate. I was spared having to go through chemo and radiation, and my team offered me a new procedure using a neobladder. Essentially, I could live a much more normal life and continue my active lifestyle than if I had needed to use a urostomy bag.\"Tom S. BLADDER CANCER CTCA ChicagoSafety, Our First Commitment The We ARE (Accountable, Reliable and Empowered) Safe initiative establishes a framework to create a culture of safety for CTCA patients. As an organization committed to eliminating preventable harm through the detection and correction of system weaknesses, we have implemented high-reliability strategies such as self checking (Stop-Think-Act-Review), peer checking, communication tools (Situation-Background-Assessment- Recommendation), Leader Rounding and Daily Safety Check-ins. In this effort, CTCA has engaged Press Ganey Healthcare Performance Improvement (HPI), a national leader in patient safety, which works with over 600 hospitals across the U.S. Further, CTCA is committed to the National Patient Safety Goals established by The Joint Commission, which accredits more than 19,000 health care organizations and programs nationally. To assess our success in establishing a culture committed to patient safety, CTCA hospitals utilize the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Hospital Survey on the Culture of Patient Safety, a validated staff survey considered among the top-cited and most well-respected instruments in the country. The most recent comparative results are based on 2018 data during which more than 600 hospitals utilized the instrument, constituting a comparative data set of over 382,000 responses. Conducting the survey every 24 months and contributing to the national database, CTCA hospitals' most recent Patient Safety Grade and composite scores are presented in comparison to the AHRQ 2018 national norms.

Although not an exact match to publicly reported data, more timely internal data create transparency at all organizational levels and support real-time improvement. Through a dashboard approach, CTCA continuously monitors and assesses a variety of metrics related to the IOM aims with respect to care outcomes, processes and structures. The list of metrics changes as CTCA views the metrics of interest from multiple angles, including those of our patients, clinicians, the board of directors of the CTCA hospitals and the employer and payer communities. The following measures are examples of our current focus areas. INFECTION PREVENTION The prevention of hospital-acquired infections is a national priority. CTCA conducts Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI) and Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) surveillance in all inpatient care areas utilizing surveillance definitions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). CTCA has implemented a number of CLABSI and CAUTI prevention efforts to reduce the number of infections and sustain evidence-based practices for central line and urinary catheter insertion and maintenance as evidenced by our performance. In addition, recognizing that proper hand washing is a simple yet effective way to prevent infections, CTCA monitors compliance with CDC guidelines for hand hygiene.0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0Rate per 1,000 Device /uniF6AELOWER SCORE PREFERRED/uniF6AF 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0Rate | Lower Score Preferred HAND HYGIENE COMPLIANCE | Higher Score Preferred 59 OUR PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY RESULTSThe inpatient complications of care rate depicts the percentage of inpatient cases with a complication code, excluding complications that were already present on admission (POA) or related to pre-existing conditions upon admission to the hospital. By excluding complications that were POA, this measure provides results that more directly reflect quality of care. These codes are useful for screening for adverse events that patients experience as a result of exposure to the health care system, which are likely amenable to prevention by changes at the system or provider level. CTCA continues to take appropriate action to ensure our patients are provided safe and high quality care at all times. The graph to the right displays the average length of stay for an inpatient admission. Monitoring trends and improving processes related to management of patients have reduced the number of days our patients stay in the hospital without sacrificing quality or patient safety.INPATIENT COMPLICATIONS OF CARE % Cases with Complications 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.07.08.09.010.0 LENGTH OF STAYINPATIENT COMPLICATIONS, LENGTH OF STAY AND ADVERSE EVENTS CTCA hospitals utilize Crimson Continuum of Care (CCC) software, an industry-leading solution, to aggregate our source system data to produce meaningful metrics, providing visibility into our coded data for purposes of benchmarking and supporting improvement. The CCC database has over 1,000 hospital members and represents approximately one-third of all inpatient admissions in the U.S. The tool uses a severity-adjusted methodology based on the 3M All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR DRG) grouper to compare only clinically-relevant cases. Safe Care, Quality Care QUALITY METRICS PATIENT SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS COMPOSITE The Patient Safety and Adverse Events Composite, known as PSI 90, is a composite score that provides an overview of hospital- level quality as it relates to a set of potentially preventable hospital- related events associated with harmful outcomes for patients. Included in this measure are events such as developing a stage 3-4 pressure ulcer, postoperative hemorrhage and postoperative sepsis. Our commitment to safety and eliminating patient harm has led to an overall reduction in our composite score.PATIENT SAFETY INDICATOR 0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.01.11.21.3Composite Score Care QUALITY METRICS PATIENT SAFETY INDICATOR (PSI) 90 Lower Score Preferred 61 OUR PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY RESULTS 60 CTCA Patient Treatment Results 2019 | 2020Safe Care, Quality Care QUALITY METRICSSafe Care, Quality Care OVERALL QOPI QUALITY SCORE AND QOPI METRICS Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI) In response to the IOM report that identified major gaps in both quality and safety of patient care, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) created the Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI), which was launched in 2006. Developed under the guidance of an expert panel of oncologists, the program provides a process for standardized assessment of care and reliable information to help focus improvement activities. Currently, approximately 1,000 U.S.-based oncology practices are registered in QOPI of which just over 300 are certified. All five CTCA\u00ae hospitals have achieved and maintain QOPI certification. Oncology practices that wish to achieve a three-year certification from QOPI must meet stringent criteria. This begins with an assessment of performance against a set number of scored quality metrics, calculating a composite overall score and submitting data on approximately 150 measures. To achieve QOPI certification, a practice must achieve an overall quality score of 75% or higher and comply with 26 safety standards. QOPI measures fall into the following categories: core, disease-specific and domain-specific. Core measures include areas such as staging, pathology testing and pain. Domain-specific measures include symptom management and care at the end of life. Disease-specific modules include breast, colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer. The following graph reflects performance for the most current data submission period, according to certification and maintenance requirements. 0102030405060708090100 Atlanta Spring 2019OVERALL QOPI | Quality Spring Spring ACQUIRED PRESSURE ULCER Stage 2 or > | Lower Score PreferredNURSING-SENSITIVE INDICATORS CTCA utilizes numerous nursing- sensitive indicators to assess patient safety and quality. Two measures monitored include patient falls and hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPU). CTCA assesses the risk of falling continuously and puts into place prevention efforts to keep each patient safe. The pressure ulcer metric explores the relationship between nursing assessments performed, interventions used and pressure ulcer development. The development of a HAPU places the patient at risk for other adverse events and increases resource consumption and health care costs. In most at-risk patients, interventions to reduce pressure and shear, and to mitigate other patient risk factors (immobility, incontinence, impaired nutrition, etc.) will decrease development. CTCA targets a rate of \"0\" for both metrics \u2014 striving for no pressure ulcers or falls occurring in our facilities. 1 Based upon performance of all hospitals (n=1,757) participating in the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI), FY18Q1 data 63 OUR PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY RESULTS 62 CTCA Patient Treatment Results 2019 | 2020Safe Care, Quality Care SCORED KEY QOPI METRICSSafe Care, Quality Care SCORED KEY QOPI METRICS The scored quality metrics below reflect the performance of CTCA hospitals in aggregate and how these scores compare to the QOPI aggregate.1 Directional arrows are used to reflect where CTCA is higher, the same as, or lower than the QOPI norm.

I never felt rushed when talking to my doctors; they were patient, answered all my questions, and if they didn't have the answer, they followed up with me by phone or email. I also took advantage of nutrition, naturopathic support and mind-body counseling at CTCA, which I found helpful in coping physically and emotionally with my surgery and treatments.\"ADVANCES IN TREATMENT OPTIONS - CONTINUED Dennis Citrin, Bradford Tan, Patel, Vicki Brzezinski. of Patients with Lobular Breast Cancer Harboring Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Mutation with HER2-Directed Therapy.

[Book Chapter/Textbook]Our Accreditations and Certifications Cancer Treatment Centers of America\u00ae (CTCA) comprehensive care and research centers are accredited and recognized by several renowned professional health care organizations that assess and monitor the quality of patient care. The voluntary accreditations and certifications highlighted were earned by all CTCA\u00ae centers unless otherwise specified. THE JOINT COMMISSION The Joint Commission's Gold Seal of Approval\u00ae for Hospital Accreditation reflects a commitment to providing safe and effective patient care and a willingness to voluntarily undergo rigorous, unannounced onsite surveys. Accreditation requires compliance with standards related to areas such as patient rights, environment of care, infection prevention, leadership and medication management. QUALITY ONCOLOGY PRACTICE INITIATIVE (QOPI) The QOPI Certification Program, an affiliate of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), recognizes outpatient practices that meet the benchmarks for breast, colorectal, non-small cell lung, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, gynecologic and prostate cancers. This seal designates those practices that scored high on key QOPI quality measures and met rigorous chemotherapy safety standards established by ASCO and the Oncology Nursing Society. COMMISSION ON CANCER (COC) The COC recognizes cancer care programs for their commitment to providing comprehensive, high-quality, multidisciplinary patient-centered care. COC Program Standards require facilities to create meaningful processes for implementation of patient-centered care. NATIONAL ACCREDITATION PROGRAM FOR BREAST CENTERS (NAPBC) Accreditation by the NAPBC is granted only to those centers that are voluntarily committed to providing the highest standards of care to patients with diseases of the breast. NAPBC requires a rigorous evaluation in a number of areas, including program leadership, use of evidence-based practices, surgery, imaging and quality improvement process. AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY IMAGING ACCREDITATION (ACR) ACR accreditation indicates that providers adhere to the highest level of image quality and safety by documenting the requirements for equipment, medical personnel and quality assurance. All CTCA centers have earned accreditation in radiation oncology along with various imaging modalities, including mammography, CT, PET, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, MRI, and, as appropriate, breast MRI, breast ultrasound and stereotactic breast biopsy. Our Research Publications & Presentations 79 OUR ACCREDITATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS 78 CTCA Patient Treatment Results 2019 | 2020Our Accreditations and Certifications STEM CELL TRANSPLANT AND CELL THERAPY PROGRAM FACT ACCREDITATION The Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT), an internationally recognized accrediting body for hospitals that perform stem cell transplants, designates the threshold for excellence in cellular therapy including bone marrow or cord blood transplant. FACT recognizes excellence with respect to clinical care, donor management, apheresis collection, processing, storage, transportation, autologous administration and cell release. CTCA Chicago and CTCA Philadelphia have earned the FACT accreditation. COLLEGE OF AMERICAN PATHOLOGISTS ACCREDITATION (CAP) The CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program accredits the entire spectrum of laboratory test disciplines with the most scientifically rigorous customized checklist requirements. Serving as the gold standard, this accreditation ensures compliance to laboratory standards and safety measures and maintenance of staff proficiency. All CTCA centers are CAP accredited; the laboratory at CTCA Chicago and CTCA Philadelphia are also CAP-accredited biorepository programs. These laboratories collect, process and store biospecimens to support future scientific investigation. MAGNET RECOGNITION Awarded by the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC), Magnet status is considered the highest honor a hospital can achieve for its nursing programs. Of the nearly 5,000 hospitals in the United States, fewer than nine percent have earned Magnet Recognition. CTCA Chicago has achieved this designation with each of the remaining centers in the process of attaining accreditation. CERTIFIED QUALITY BREAST CENTER OF EXCELLENCE (NQMBC) The NQMBC Program evaluates breast programs using various quality indicators in the areas of imaging, surgery, cancer registry, pathology, radiation and patient satisfaction.
