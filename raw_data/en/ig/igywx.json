[Show details](#__NBK559836_dtls__) OVERVIEW Introduction Energy drinks are defined as over-the-counter commercial beverages with high caffeine content that are advertised as boosting energy including mental alertness and physical performance. More than 50 brands of energy drinks are available in grocery stores, nutrition centers, beverage shops and on the internet. Consumption of excess energy drinks has been linked to several instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury which can be severe and result in fatal or urgent liver transplantation. The components in energy drinks that account for the liver injury are not clear and caffeine by itself has not been linked to hepatic injury. Background Energy drinks are defined as beverages with high concentrations of caffeine that are purported to boost energy, physical and athletic performance and mental alertness. Energy drinks were first marketed in the late 1990s and have subsequently become popular and widely available. The commercial products vary greatly in concentration of caffeine as well as in other characteristics, such as carbonation, flavoring, sugar and sweeteners, vitamins, minerals, amino acids and botanical ingredients. Popular brands include Red Bull, Monster, Rockstar, NOS Energy, Xyience, Bang, Celsius, Zevia, Full Throttle and Kick Start. The caffeine content of these products varies from 5 to 40 mg per ounce, and a single serving (8 to 24 ounces; 235-710 mL) may contain up to 300 mg of caffeine. Caffeine is also present in regular soft drinks but generally in amounts similar to tea (2 to 5 mg/oz; and 24 to 60 mg per 12 oz can), although soft drink brands with extra caffeine have also become popular (Pepsi Max, Jolt Cola, Mountain Dew Energy). The average caffeine content in selected energy drinks and soft drinks is shown in the table below. Caffeine has been shown to have psychoactive properties and to increase alertness and wakefulness and improve physical and athletic performance, although to a minor degree and with considerable inter-individual variability. Caffeine in typical amounts is well tolerated and not associated with significant side effects or long term adverse outcomes. Adverse side effects of caffeine are generally dose related and can include nervousness, irritability, insomnia, headaches, rapid heartbeat, tremor, and gastrointestinal discomfort. In high doses, generally in excess of 1000 mg daily, caffeine can have severe toxicity, marked by confusion, excessive anxiety, mania, hallucinations, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, cardiorespiratory arrest and death. Caffeine Content of Selected Soft Drinks and Energy Drinks Available in the United to 5||1 cup, 8 oz||15-35| - * Concentrations and volumes are rounded off. Several of the commercial products have multiple formulations, flavors and special names. Abbreviations: aa, amino acids; min, minerals; vit, vitamins. Hepatotoxicity Caffeine containing energy drinks are widely used and generally well tolerated. Neverless, when taken in excessive amounts they can lead to caffeine toxicity with tremors, confusion, mania, stupor and coma and cardiac arrhythmias and cardiorespiratory failure. In addition, there have been several single case reports of liver injury linked to use of caffeine-rich energy drinks. These reports were often incompletely documented and not completely convincing. In several instances, the hepatic injury resembled acute hepatic necrosis or ischemic hepatitis (Case 1) that may have been due to a drug overdose or cardiac arrest. In other cases, other diagnoses were not completely ruled out (Case 2). Furthermore, it remains unclear whether the hepatic effects of the energy drinks were caused by caffeine per se or to other components included in their formulation, such as vitamins, herbs or other botanical products. The reports of caffeine overdose including cases with autopsies, hepatic injury has been absent or not mentioned. Thus, caffeine is unlikely to cause liver injury, but the various high caffeine energy drinks which are widely used may possibly cause liver injury when used to excess. [Likelihood score](/books/n/livertox/glossary/def-item/glossary.likelihood-score/): C[H] (probable rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury when used in high amounts). Mechanism of Injury Caffeine is metabolized by the microsomal P450 drug metabolizing enzymes, predominantly CYP 1A2. Patients with advanced cirrhosis may have delayed metabolism of caffeine and experience caffeine side effects (nervousness, insomnia, headache) at levels of intake that are well tolerated by patients without liver disease. Energy drinks typically have high concentrations of caffeine but also a myriad of other components including vitamins, minerals, amino acids, sugar and various herbal products, the concentration and purity of which are usually unknown. Drug Class: [CNS Stimulants](/books/n/livertox/CNSStimulants/), [Xanthine Derivatives](/books/n/livertox/XanthineDerivatives/) See also [Caffeine](/books/n/livertox/Caffeine/) CASE REPORT Case 1. Acute liver injury attributed to use of energy drinks.( [1](#EnergyDrinks.REF.1)) A 22 year old woman developed low grade fever, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting and was found to have abnormal liver tests after having consumed 10 cans of energy drinks daily for 2 weeks. On examination in the emergency room, she had epigastric tenderness but no other findings and was sent home. The following day she developed jaundice and was admitted to the hospital. She denied alcohol or drug abuse and was not taking other medications. Laboratory tests showed marked elevations in [ALT](/books/n/livertox/glossary/def-item/glossary.alanine-aminotransferase-alt-/) and [AST](/books/n/livertox/glossary/def-item/glossary.aspartate-aminotransferase-ast-/) (Table) but normal levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and [GGT](/books/n/livertox/glossary/def-item/glossary.gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase-ggt-/). The INR was 1.6. Acetaminophen levels were undetectable. There was no serologic evidence of acute hepatis A, B, C or E and tests for Epstein Barr virus and cytomegalovirus infection were negative. She was managed conservatively. She did not undergo liver biopsy or imaging studies. Serum aminotransferase levels decreased rapidly and she was discharged four days later. In follow up one month later, she was asymptomatic and serum ALT levels were normal. Key Points |Medication:||Energy drinks (10 cans daily for 2 weeks)| |Pattern:||Hepatocellular (R=~172)| |Severity:||3+ (jaundice and Hospitalization)| Laboratory Values Comment This short report described a young woman who presented with acute hepatic necrosis that was attributed to consumption of energy drinks for two weeks. The marked [ALT](/books/n/livertox/glossary/def-item/glossary.alanine-aminotransferase-alt-/) and [AST](/books/n/livertox/glossary/def-item/glossary.aspartate-aminotransferase-ast-/) levels, the R ratio above 100, the abnormality of INR with minimal elevation in bilirubin and the rapid improvement within a week of onset are typical features of acute hepatic necrosis and not typical of the acute hepatitis seen with idiosyncratic drug induced liver injury. The clinical presentation was similar to that of acute acetaminophen overdose or acute ischemic hepatitis, both of which might be considered more likely than acute injury from a commercial energy drink. The components of the energy drink that were responsible for the severe acute liver injury were not clear. The product name of the energy drink was not provided, but the ingredients listed in the report included vitamins, minerals and an \"energy blend\" which was likely to include caffeine, but other herbal components were not given. Case 2. Acute hepatitis attributed to use of energy drinks.( [2](#EnergyDrinks.REF.2)) A 50 year old previously healthy man developed nausea, anorexia, epigastric pain and fatigue followed by dark urine and jaundice and was found to have markedly abnormal liver tests. He reported that he had been drinking 4 to 5 cans of an energy drink for the previous 3 weeks. He denied a history of liver disease, drug allergies, alcohol abuse, injection drug use or risk factors for viral hepatitis. He was not taking other medications or over-the-counter products. Initially, total serum bilirubin 1.0. Tests for acute hepatitis A, B and E were negative, but he was positive for both anti-HCV and HCV RNA (5.6 million IU/mL). Antinuclear and smooth muscle antibodies were negative. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed no gallstones or evidence of biliary obstruction. A liver biopsy showed acute hepatitis with bridging necrosis and cholestasis but no fibrosis. Despite the HCV serology, he was diagnosed as having liver injury due to consumption of energy drinks, the suspected ingredient being niacin. After worsening for a few days, he began to improve spontaneously (Table) and in follow up weeks later he was asymptomatic and serum aminotransferase levels were normal. Follow up HCV RNA results were not reported. Key Points |Medication:||Energy drinks (4-5 cans daily for 3 weeks)| Comment This case report described a 50 year old construction worker who presented with acute hepatitis three weeks after starting regular consumption of energy drinks (4 to 5 cans of an undeclared product daily). Importantly, he also tested positive for anti-HCV and HCV RNA despite having no risk factors for hepatitis C and no previous knowledge of being infected. The authors attributed the acute hepatitis to consumption of the energy drinks and not to hepatitis C, arguing that he more likely had an asymptomatic chronic HCV infection. However, the clinical presentation, liver biopsy findings and subsequent course are entirely compatible with acute hepatitis C. The challenge in this diagnosis is that serologic tests (including IgM anti-HCV) are unreliable in separating acute from chronic infection, and definitive diagnosis of acute vs chronic HCV infection depends upon documentation of seroconversion to anti-HCV positivity. The diagnosis can also be fairly reliably made if the infection resolves as the hepatitis resolves with disappearance of HCV RNA (and rising titers of anti-HCV) or if there is a recent clear history of exposure. Such documentation, however, is not always available and a high proportion of patients with acute hepatitis C develop de novo chronic infection. In large case series, acute hepatitis C accounts for 1% to 5% of cases initially suspected to be drug induced liver injury. Of the six reported cases of acute liver injury from energy drink consumption published between 2000 and 2020, none were very convincing and most had other possible explanations (ischemic hepatitis, liver injury from other drugs being taken, acetaminophen or other toxic overdose).
