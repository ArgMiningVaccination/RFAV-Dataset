For example, increased levels of c-Src not only inhibit differentiation but also induce the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as fibronectin (1), a protein critically involved in cell migration. The abnormal secretion of ECM proteins stems from the inability of c-Src overexpressing cells to sense their environment and to act in-sync with local tissue demand, likely because of a constitutive activation of ECM biosensors such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We hypothesize that the secretion of ECM proteins is an early event in malignant transformation induced by increased oncogene ... - [A Study to Evaluate Prevention of Paclitaxel-Associated Neuropathy with Fingolimod](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20459309) Rochester, MN The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of Gilenya\u00ae can reduce neuropathy caused by paclitaxel. - [Cutaneous Lymphoma Database](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20272699) Scottsdale/Phoenix, AZ The purpose of this study is to create a long-term, prospective database of cutaneous lymphoma that will lead to a better understanding of the biological behavior of cutaneous lymphomas as well as the effectiveness of interventions. - [Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are at Increased Risk for Colorectal Cancer and Early Dysplasia](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20308370) Rochester, MN The purpose of the study is to: - Map and compare the neoplasia-associated epigenetic field in IBD-CRN, sporadic CRN and controls. - Measure sensitivity of DNA methylation for the detection of synchronous IBD-CRN as a complement or alternative to histologic diagnosis of dysplasia on random biopsies. - Measure the density and types of lymphocytes infiltrating IBD-CRN tumors, sporadic tumors and the epigenetic field. - [3D Ultrasound Vascular Imaging for Breast Cancers](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20517305) Rochester, MN The goal of the project is to develop and test a new 3D Doppler technology, with enhanced vessel sensitivity than conventional Doppler, to employ tumor vascularity as a differential biomarker for improved cancer diagnosis and reduced unnecessary biopsy on benign tumors - [Minimally Invasive Molecular Approaches for the Diagnosis of Barrett's Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20461792) Scottsdale/Phoenix, AZ; WI; Mankato, MN; Rochester, MN This study will evaluate if the sponge capsule device can accurately detect the presence of Barrett's Esophagus and prevalent dysplasia/adenocarcinoma detection, in a screening population, with and without chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease. - [Radioiodine Planar and a SPECT/CT Imaging With Iodine-123 for Evaluation of Follicular Thyroid Nodules Prior to Surgery](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20521080) Rochester, MN The objective of this study is to determine intensity of I-123 uptake in follicular thyroid lesions before surgery and correlate with final pathology findings. - [Calcium and Magnesium in Preventing Peripheral Neuropathy Caused by Ixabepilone in Patients With Breast Cancer](/research/clinical-trials/cls-20453011) Rochester, MN RATIONALE: Giving calcium together with magnesium may stop or delay the development of peripheral neuropathy in patients with cancer who are receiving treatment with ixabepilone.
