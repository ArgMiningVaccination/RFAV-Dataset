Elevations ofGHQ scores, especially when persistent over twoadministrations oftheGHQ separated byseven months, were strongly associated with probability ofentering health care during thefirst twelve months after enrollment intheHMO. This association was observed forboth mental health andnon-mental health utilization.

The third section addr=s= issues related totheanalysis disease and multiplicative models. Two distinct topics are discussed. The first paper considers theuseofmixture models inorder todiscriminate between, andmore generally test thefitof,additive and multiplicative relative risk models. This work, including detailed examples, demonstrates that large numbers ofsubjects and disease events will typically benecessary to effect such discrimination. The remaining twosections inthisbook deal with complex andpractice ofsample survey research.
