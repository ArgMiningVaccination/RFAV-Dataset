Public health measures, combined with a reduction in malnutrition and improved water supplies and sanitation, have reduced the infant mortality rate from 250 per 1000 live births in 1950 to less than 50 in 1980. Life expectancy increased from 35 in 1949 to almost 70 in 1980 (1). Indeed, the achievement of accessible primary health care for virtually all people in a country with a per capita income as low as $290 (1980) is unique in the world (2). The introduction of the rural responsibility system at the beginning of the 'eighties, which made the economic interest of the peasants directly linked to their capability, to the efforts they make and to the results of their production, has had a profound influence on rural living conditions. Among other things, per capita income increased from 290Y in 1980 to 436Y in 1987 (3). The responsibility system also had a major impact on several aspects of the rural health care system. The financing of health care by the rural cooperative insurance schemes, the availability and functions of primary medical care personnel (barefoot doctors (BFDs) or rural doctors) and the availability of community resources for health campaigns have all been affected. Secondary effects, such as increased demand for higher quality care, have been felt by the higher levels of health care in the counties and urban areas. Other factors which will not be addressed in this paper but have also influenced the demand for health services are: the rapidly increasing prevalence of chronic and disabling diseases and the increased value now placed upon the health of children because of the one child family policy.-2- This paper will focus on the impact of the economic responsibility system which has resulted in an attrition of BFDs, change in the financing of rural health care, increased demand for higher quality medical care and decreased resources for preventive services. These developments challenge the viability of primary health care for all in rural China. Can the Chinese maintain their relative success in providing preventive and primary care to the vast majority of the rural population? How should the Chinese respond to the new challenges they will face in the near future? This paper addresses these two issues. The outline is as follows. Chapter 1 presents the background of the Chinese health care delivery system before 1980, and changes that occurred since 1980 with the introduction of the responsibility system. Chapter 2 discusses the responses to changes that occurred after the rural reform. These include training issues, the demand for higher remunerations and trials with new forms of health care financing. Chapter 4 discusses the observed trends, in rural areas as well as the secondary effects on the urban health care delivery system. Chapter 5 draws conclusions for the long term development of the rural health care system in China.3 1. THE RURAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM Background Chinese traditional medicine, dating back to 2500 B.C., is the world's oldest body of medical knowledge. It applies a wide variety of therapeutic measures, from acupuncture and moxibustion to thousands of herbal preparations. Until the 17th century the traditional medicine was the only one available to the Chinese people. The first Jesuit missionaries with some knowledge of Western medicine began arriving in China at the beginning of the 17th century, but achieved only a limited impact. The first school of Western medicine, St. John's University Medical School, was founded by missionaries in Shanghai in 1880. In 1881 the Chinese established a second medical school in Tienjin. Western medicine was systematically introduced in 1917, and the number of graduates averaged 500 per year (9449 doctors graduated between 1928 and 1947). Thus, few people had access to Western medicine, which was available only in the major cities. Rural people received medical care from traditional medicine practitioners who had perpetuated their art by apprenticeship, a system that had lasted for more than 3000 years (4, 5). By 1949 there were 276,000 doctors of traditional medicine who provided the bulk of therapeutic medical care to the Chinese people and 38,000 doctors of Western medicine, approximately one per 15,000 people (Table 1 shows the number of people per doctor between 1950 and 1980) (6, 7). As a consequence of poverty and malnutrition, the population of China before 1949 was burdened by a high incidence and prevalence of infectious diseases, such as typhoid fever, cholera, and tuberculosis, and by premature-4- TABLE 1 Physicians of Western and Traditional Medicine as a Ratio of Population, 1950, 1952, 1965, 1980, 1986 Physicians Physician to Physicians of Physician to of Western Population Traditional Population Medicine Ratio Medicine Ratio 1950 41,000 1:14,056 286,000 Bank data.5 TABLE 2 Estimates of Life Expectancy and Infant Mortality, 1949, 1982, 1986 Mortality Indicator 1949 1982 1986 Infant Mortality Rate 200 20.3 Urban 14.3 (per thousand live births) Rural 27.3 Life Expectancy (years) 35 68 68.9 Source: Chinese Health Statistical Digest, Ministry of Public Health, PRC, 1986.6- deaths. The crude death rate was 30 to 40 per 1000 population, the infant mortality rate was 200 per 1000 live births, and life expectancy was 35 years (Table 2). At that time there was little preventive medicine in China and there were only some general national or municipal public health services. After 1949, traditional medicine continued to play an important role in the new China. Emphasis was placed on integrating traditional medicine and Western medicine, on rapidly increasing the number of health personnel, on providing better distribution of health manpower, and on focusing on public health works (i.e., improvement of environmental sanitation, vaccination against infectious diseases, and elimination of flies, mosquitos, rats, bedbugs and other pests). During 1950 to 1980, a remarkable increase in life expectancy and a sharp reduction in the infant mortality rate were achieved. Life expectancy rose from 35 years in 1949 to almost 70 in 1980. The infant mortality rate declined from 200 per 1000 live births in 1949 to less than 50 in 1980. Much of China's success in improving the health of its people can be attributed to the health policies and the national health service delivery system. Aiming to establish rapidly a health system that could cover the entire population, the People's Republic of China (PRC) established guidelines: 1. Emphasis on preventive services relative to curative services. 2. Training of health auxiliaries to take precedence over training high- level professionals. 3. Focusing resources to support preventive services, and to subsidize the cost of drugs and medical services.-7- Before the Rural Reform Without external aid China is said to have built a rural health care system that makes primary health care a right for each individual. This system operates on three levels: the brigade health station, the commune health center, and the county hospital (Table 3). The brigade health station is the base of the pyramid of the three-tier system. Two to four BFDs provide care for a population of 1000 to 3000. In 1982, almost 90 percent of brigades in rural China had a brigade health station and were covered by a rural cooperative insurance system. The BFDs provide basic curative care, distribute both Western and traditional medicine, and provide preventive services such as family planning and communicable disease surveillance. The brigade health station is financed through a cooperative health insurance system by collecting annual fees from brigade members, by selling medicinal herbs for profit and by a subsidy from a brigade welfare fund. 1- It is also subsidized by the commune or county if there is a deficit. In addition, all preventive services and some drugs are provided by the county or province. The commune health center provides curative medical care, epidemic prevention services, and maternal and child health care. The medical care division provides inpatient and outpatient services, including surgical operations such as abortions and sterilization. The epidemic prevention division is in charge of disease surveillance and the organization of health campaigns. The maternal child health division provides routine obstetrical and pediatrics services. The commune health centers receive referrals from 1/ The welfare fund is a small amount (1 percent) allocated from the net collective income of the brigade to be used for educational, health, cultural, and other public functions.-8- TABLE 3 Vertical and Horizontal Political Organization in Rural China Population Executive Chinese Unit Responsible Administra- Size of Branch of Communist for Health tive Level Typical Unit Government Party Unit Services Nation 1,008,175,000 State Secretariat Ministry of Health Council of Central (supervisory) Committee Province 2,000,000- Provincial Provincial Provincial Health (or Autonomous 100,000,000 Government Party Bureau (supervisory) Region or Committee Hospitals, Epidemic Municipality) station and MCH Stations The Three Tier, County-Politico-Administrative Organization County 400,000- County County County Health Bureau 600,000 Government Party (supervisory), Committee Hospital, Epidemic Station, MCH Station Commune 1/ 15,000- Commune Commune Commune Health (Township) 50,000 Management Party Center Committee Committee Production 1,000- Brigade Brigade Brigade Health Brigade (Village) 3,000 Leadership Party Station Group Branch 1/ Since the introduction of the household responsibility system the commune that combined production with government functions has undergone reorganization. In the past, the commune was both an economic organization and a grassroots government agency. From 1980 on, the two were separated, and the town/township government was set up. Thus the commune is no longer so called.-9- from the brigade health stations and are responsible for technical supervision and training of BFDs at the production brigade level. The size of the commune health centers may vary from 5-7 observational beds to a small hospital of 50 beds. The commune health centers, approximately 14 per county, are linked to the county hospital, which serves as the referral center for the entire county (from approximately 400,000 to 1,300,000 population). The county hospital provides technical support and supervises the lower-level health care units. Thus, the BFDs at the base of the three-tier system play a key role in providing first-level contact between the community and the health care system and serve as entry points into the health care system. Ideally, referrals are triaged through them. However, peasants can and often do bypass the referral system by paying fees directly to the commune health centers or to the county hospital. One special feature of the Chinese health care system is the integration of vertical programs that are initiated at the national level but implemented by primary care programs locally. For example, the vertical programs, such as immunization, malaria, and leprosy, are initiated by the epidemic prevention station. The BFD has a central role in the implementation and integration of services at the base level. The tasks in preventive services (e.g., vaccinations, delivery of birth control methods, identification of tuberculosis and malaria patients) are carried out by the BFD, who also provides curative care to the brigade members Major health programs have been incrementally developed and implemented during 1950 to 1980. last 30 years. The BFD's training and-10 - functions have always been directed to the most prevalent health problems of the people. Consequently, the BFD's practice has seen a spectrum of activities rather than one standardized profession. After the revolution, the earliest health programs were directed toward reducing the most prevalent contagious diseases -- including cholera, tuberculosis, and malaria -- and with mass immunization programs, public education for personal hygiene, and pest control campaigns. The health workers concentrated their efforts on these programs. However, as socioeconomic conditions improved, concerns shifted toward increasing nutritional standards and providing a broad network of maternal and child care services to reduce the infant mortality rate. With better hygiene, better sanitary conditions, and reduction of the infant mortality rate since the late 1970s, birth control then became the next high priority, and preventive methods were taught to men and women by the BFDs. Thus, while health care needs changed, so did the activities of the BFDs as resources were directed to problems most in need of attention. These continuously shifting priorities in relationship to environmental and population needs may have been and may still be the key factor in the success of the BFD program and of the health care system in general. After the Rural Reform The introduction of the responsibility system and the modernization policy in 1980 led to a major change in rural health services. The model of self-reliant 3-tier health services has been replaced by a pluralistic system with a combination of private (fee for service) and public (government subsidized) services similar to the western type health care systems. Health-11 care financed by rural cooperative insurance schemes virtually collapsed from 90 percent coverage to less than 25 percent. The functions of the BFD and the availability of community resources for health campaigns have also decreased. The success of the barefoot doctor's movement in China has been widely acclaimed as an example of what can be done with limited resources. The BFDs' contribution to the achievements of the Chinese health system has been facilitated by a high level of community participation and acceptance. Furthermore, by politically mobilizing the population, BFDs have carried out immunization programs, pest control campaigns, and environmental sanitation works. With political backing, the BFDs have been accepted as health workers by the community. However, the function of the BFDs in China has changed with the political, economic, and ideological shifts that have taken place over the past decade. Under the previous collective system, agricultural labor was paid on a point system related to hours of labor input without reference to productivity. The BFD's were also paid on the same point system. The responsibility system now makes the individual household or group responsible for farming a specific plot of collectively owned land. The household/group contracts with the brigade to meet a specific production quota. Sales of any excess produce are retained by the household/group. The new economic incentives have resulted in significant income increases for the rural population. Increased income for peasants has led to an increase in demand for health services and to a shift toward higher technology, higher-quality services. As the households replace collective production, the brigade's administrative organization is weakened. Cooperative health services are-12 - collapsing rapidly. Brigade members are less interested in organizing cooperative insurance schemes; they now perceive the risk of pooling benefits provided by insurance as less advantageous because they can afford to pay medical fees. The time spent administering cooperative services is viewed as wasteful when that time can be spent more productively in farming activities. Peasants are also inclined to seek care earlier and more frequently as their incomes rise. This has changed the activities performed by BFDs, who were previously mainly paid by the work point system but now earn almost all of their income through fees for services. Many more curative than preventive activities are now being performed (8-13).-13 - 2. RESPONSES TO THE RURAL REFORM Attrition of Barefoot Doctors As peasants' potential income increased the income of BFDs, based on work points, fell behind. The responsibility system has raised the opportunity cost of work as a BFD by making agricultural or non-agricultural entrepreneurial activities relatively more attractive for BFDs. The number of BFDs have fallen from a peak of 1.6 million in 1975 to 1.28 million in 1986 (14). Chinese officials in the Ministry of Public Health, however, attribute this reduction to the dismissal of technically incompetent BFDs; thus the reduction in number may partly reflect an increase in quality. Indeed, the policy since 1980 has emphasized upgrading BFDs' skills. Additional training has been offered by qualified doctors at the commune health centers and county secondary training centers. A \"rural doctor certificate\" is awarded to those who have passed a qualification examination after retraining. The initial training of the newly recruited BFDs (now called Rural Doctors) is now a minimum of six months to one year in contrast to the three months term offered earlier. Privatization of Rural Health Services In 1982, almost 90 percent of villages (formerly brigades) were covered by some form of cooperative insurance. By 1983-84, less than a quarter of villages retained a cooperative insurance scheme. New methods to pay for primary care at the grassroots level include a revolving fund, set up by the village to maintain the village health station's medical supplies. In addition, the rural doctor generates his income from profits earned from sales-14 - of drugs and registration, injection, and other procedural fees. Another method is a private enterprise, in which the rural doctor sets himself up in medical practice. After a period where the fee-for-services payment system dominated in the rural areas, with peasants out-of-pocket payments being the only source of revenues for medical services, alternative trials of financing basic medical care have emerged in villages, townships and counties throughout China. The rate of cooperative insurance has increased again, to about 50 percent in 1986. Paradoxically, the wealthier areas, where the village administration can offer high benefit levels and individual peasants can easily afford a premium, are now the ones with the highest insurance coverage. In the poorer provinces, cooperatives have virtually been completely replaced by fee-for- service systems. Alternative Health Care Financing Experiences in China The results of the many alternative health care financing experiences that are currently being tried in rural areas are published in the Jian Kang Bao (\"Health Newspaper\", published in Beijing). A review of the Jian Kang Bao from 1982 to 1986, showed an increased proportion of villages adopting varying schemes of collective medical insurance to finance the basic care. (Annex 1 summarizes reported financing options carried out in various provinces.) Furthermore, new methods of management, such as merging the village stations and township health centers under one administration, have also been attempted. The financing options tried out in various parts of China range from public full health insurance coverage for all care, to no coverage at all-15 - coupled with a fee-for-service structure. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the \"evaluation\" of the various experiments is very soft; in general it is found that \"attitudes improved\", \"the system is more efficient\" and \"there is less waste\". Consequently, the relative merits of the various alternatives should be judged with care, preferably based on more experience with such structures in other countries. Though most of the discussion on the collapse of the cooperative system focuses on the question of how to provide health insurance for 800,000,000 peasants, the issue is sometimes casted in different terms: there was too much waste in the cooperative system; health workers were lazy, showed up late, left early; there was a lot of absenteeism; workers were rude to the patients; and the quality of care provided was bad. It is hard to believe, however, that the system was abolished because of these problems. It is more likely that the disappearance of cooperative insurance was an unanticipated side-effect of the introduction of the responsibility system. The administration of the work point system dissolved and risk pooling for payment of medical care is no longer as attractive as peasants income increased. Still, the dissatisfaction with the old system may have been partly responsible for the lack of measures to save the system. In addition, in some cases subsidies exist to lower level facilities, from county level resources and even from enterprise funds, suggesting that concern for the financing of medical care for those units and individuals who cannot afford it themselves, is still part of the motivation for the health financing experiments. The following summarizes the main points. The most general form of health-care financing currently found in the rural system is some combination-16 - of fee-for-service and subsidies. That is, part of the cost for providing medical care is recovered by charging fees for goods and services, while part still comes from general government revenues. Within this very general framework of \"two-level\" financing a large variety of specific solutions exists. At the County and Township Level There has been considerable decentralization of responsibilities in the health sector in recent years. Budgeting authorities have been delegated to the provinces, the cities, the countries, and the townships. Most health expenditures are now met from total revenues, and only a small portion of expenditures are allocated from higher levels. Government health workers at the county and township level currently face very strong incentives to improve their performance. The basic mechanism to achieve this is some type of \"responsibility system\". The most extreme form is an immediate cut in current salary (up to 50 percent) coupled with a bonus system based on performance to make up for the loss. Alternatively, performance payments are made to supplement salary. Performance is measured in terms of tasks finished, as defined by the county health bureau. A typical ''evaluation\" reads as follows: o Attendance days increased from 270 to 305 days o Quality of work increased o Drug expenditures reduced 30 percent o There were volunteers for immunization campaigns o \"Unnecessary\" expenses reduced 28 percent-17 - o More surgery performed o Revenues were up 5 percent The last point, \"revenues up\" appears in virtually every evaluation. Clearly incentives are put in place to increase production by health workers. This explicit attempt to stimulate \"supplier induced demand\" contrasts sharply with the more familiar situation in Western countries where mechanisms are being invented to cut the direct tie between a physician's income and the number of tasks or operations he or she performs. Increasingly over the last two years, township governments are assuming the entire burden to finance their own health services. Funds for major capital construction and equipment purchase are provided by the township finance bureau. The salaries of the workers are self-financed. In Hunan province 72 percent of township health centers are under administrative managment of township governments. Many township health centers are totally self-financed, generating revenue from fees. Surplus income is used for bonuses and reserve funds. In some township health centers, work is contracted out to a group of health workers who generate revenues from fees. These revenues are used to cover salaries and expenditures. Management style has also changed. In the past, a committee consisted of party cadres, and representatives from the medical staff managed the health units. Now the responsibility to manage the hospital is delegated to the medical director. The director assigns bonuses to his staff according to their performance, and he gets a bonus if the center's overall performance is judged by the health bureau to be above average.-18 - At the Village Level Though most of the experimental financing mechanisms within county and township level facilities aim at improving the performance of the workers, plain lack of financial resources motivates the search for adequate cost recovery schemes at the village level. The following is a range of options currently in place in various parts of China: o The cooperative system is still in place, but the rural doctor pays the village for the use of the health station; a fee is charged for services and reimbursed by the cooperative; drugs are not covered by the cooperative and a co-payment is required for services. This, by the way, is an interesting system that (a) forces the rural doctor to perform well and (b) puts economic incentives in place to prevent patients from \"over-using medical care\". There are many variations in the cooperative system, depending on the economic status of the villages. Rich villages provide free drugs, free services and partial reimbursement for referrals; moderately well-to-do villages provide free services, but charge for drugs. Poor villages provide free preventive services and charge for the rest. o Rural doctors lease the health station, charge a fee-for-service. Revenues after the \"rental fee\" are their income. Under this system, preventive services are often not provided by the health workers because these generate very little income. Modifications of private practice are also found. A rural doctor or a group of rural doctors is paid a base salary, plus bonuses for preventive-19 - services. Revenues are generated by a fee-for-services system and accrue to the villages. Many other alternatives are reported to maintain preventive services. These include: o A capitation system is put in place at the village level for preventive activities, i.e. the village pays the rural doctor 30 fen per person per year. The rural doctor provides immunization, family planning services, etc. In addition the rural doctor charges a fee for curative services. The fee accrues to him. o Preventive services (\"health maintenance services\") are organized at the township level. A township health maintenance service operates with voluntary enrollment (50 fen per member). Preventive services are provided free of charge by rural doctors who contract with the township health center. o Immunization and delivery insurance are sold to village members. For example, a region in Henan province provides an immunization insurance for 16Y. A child receives all the vaccines required until 7 years of age. If the child comes down with measles, a compensation of Y20 is given, with poliomyelitis Y500 is given (15). Similarly for hospital deliveries, parturients can purchase an insurance premium of Y10 to guarantee her and her infant's safety. If maternal death occurs, the hospital pays Y2000; if the newborn dies Y200 is paid to the family (16). From this large variety of options, a few general trends emerge: first, a fee-for-service for rural doctors and health workers (previously barefoot doctors) is virtually universal, thus providing a tie between tasks performed and revenues. Second, the worst health insurance coverage (often,-20 - no coverage at all) is found in the poorest areas. The richest areas pretty much kept or reinstated the full coverage cooperative system. Third, rural doctors are mainly private entrepreneurs, having some \"lease\" arrangement with the village to operate the health station. Lastly, there is a shift from preventive to curative services.-21 - 3. SECONDARY EFFECTS ON THE URBAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM One emerging consequence of the rising income of peasants is that they are demanding higher quality medical care. In response to the high demand for inpatient and outpatient care which far outstrips bed and staff capacity of the city hospitals, city health officials are pressured to further expand higher level health facilities. The local governments, under decentralization policies, are allocating comparatively more resources to the tertiary level facilities over the primary and secondary services. The poor quality of staff and facilities at these lower levels in turn result in low demand for their services. Within a city/county/township, financial planning/allocation is further decentralized. As a result of this decentralization, viability of an individual hospital depends increasingly on its cost recovery. Various methods of management responsibility systems have been introduced. Many hospitals have designated the hospital director to assume sole responsibility. This has increased efficiency and accountability. Previous indicative measures such as quotas on number of patients received every day have been dissolved. In order to increase revenues, hospitals have expanded their services, added specialty outpatient departments and offered consultation services to lower level facilities. Over the last two years there has been an increased number of \"imedical coordination joint enterprises\". These are joint enterprises between a group of hospitals (a larger institute joining operation with smaller hospitals, an urban hospital with rural hospitals; groups of specialized hospitals, local and army or enterprise hospitals.) This linkage or-22 - coordination is an attempt to increase the efficiency of the current duplicative services. Many sectors, especially industry, own their own network of hospitals and health services. For example, in Heilongjian, enterprises own one-half of total available hospital beds and one-third of health manpower in the provinces. These resources are inefficiently managed and underutilized. An attempt to increase utilization by gradual divestiture began in 1981. By 1984, utilization of industry-owned hospital beds increased from 71 percent to 77 percent. 2884 beds were made availabile for both public and enterprise use in Heilongjian. There is also reported commercialization of these \"joint enterprises\". For example, in Jilin, a hospital sends doctors to set up a clinic at the city's largest pharmaceutical company. The availability of the doctor and the convenience of the drug store is very attractive for patients seeking care, and is mutually beneficial to the hospital and the pharmaceutical company. Perhaps the most far reaching reform reported so far regards hospital pricing. In various places, government and enterprise workers are now being charged cost-based hospital fees that well exceed the standard (nationwide) fees. As a result, like in other sectors, there is now a dual pricing system: a higher price for the government and enterprise insurance as compared to the price set for self-pay patients, which is set at 35-45 percent of cost. Thus, on the one hand, very serious extra financial claims are being laid upon the already troubled government and enterprise health insurance systems, while on the other hand, a potentially large contribution is-23 - implicitly being made from government workers and other employees to medical care consumed by peasants. 1/ Current prices are still set at 35-45 percent of cost (excluding salary). In addition, for the national price to be set at below cost levels, the price is the same at all levels of sophistication, i.e., price for procedures and hospitalization at provincial hospitals is the same as county or township level hospitals. This enhances unnecessary utilization of higher level services. The hospitals are now concerned with the increasing deficit they are incurring because they are required to become self-sufficient under the decentralization policies. Pricing policy is the major issue. For each hospital day, the hospital loses 3-6Y. For each operation there is a loss of 20-30Y. Furthermore, reimbursement standards has not been updated for a long time. Capitation of government insurance in 1986 is based on 1978 price standard of 30Y P.C. per year. While there has been a 40 percent inflation for the base materials such as tape, gauze, cotton, sutures, prices of coal have risen by 200 percent; drug inflation is 76 percent. Cost of diagnostic procedures have also increased, especially the modern radiologic diagnostics such as CT scan and ultrasounds. Thus, increased peasant demand for urban health services add to the financial crisis urban hospitals are facing. With decreased subsidies from higher levels as financing of health services has become decentralized and with prices of medical services set at below cost, 1/ Although the dual pricing system increases the financial burden on the already heavily burdened government and enterprise institutions, the \"dual pricing\" in essence subsidizes the rural population, and mitigates the 1:10 imbalance in the rural-urban spending ratio of the 1970s.-24- the urban hospitals are pressured to reduce debt by improving hospital efficiency and as noted in many places by care providers generating demands through overprescription of medications and utilization of modern radiologic diagnostics.-25 - 4. SUMMARY AND OPTIONS FOR THE FUTURE The shift from collective to individual production has caused many changes in rural health care. The rural cooperative medical service and the organization of BFDs once tightly linked with the agricultural collectivization lost its financial base (the welfare fund). As peasants potential income increased, the opportunity cost of work as a barefoot doctor/rural doctor increased; this has contributed to a marked attrition of barefoot doctors. As individual/household production replaces collective production, village members are less interested in organizing cooperative medical insurance schemes; they now perceive the risk of pooling benefits provided by insurance as less advantageous because they can afford to pay medical fees. Peasants are also seeking care earlier as well as more frequent and better care. This has changed the activities performed by barefoot doctors/rural doctors, shifting the emphasis from preventive to curative activities. Finally, the increased demand for higher level services aggravates the already severe financial problems of the higher level (urban) health care system. With decentralized financing policies, local governments are assuming the burden to pay for their own public sector such as health and education. Long-term investments in manpower training, preventive and public sanitation activites tend to be underfunded. The decrease in public allocation to preventive services is compounded by patients unwillingness to pay out of pocket for such services. This has resulted in a rise in the incidence of-26 - measles and a decline in standards of environmental hygiene in various places. Over the last few years health officials have increased the emphasis on subsidizing BFDs for preventive services in response to the noticeable decline in delivery of preventive services in the rural areas, because the fee for the immunizations is small. It has become unattractive for the BFDs to provide these services. The reported trials with insurance schemes over the last 4-5 years in many provinces show that the problems caused by the breakdown of the cooperative finance system is being recognized. The cooperative medical services had provided accessible and affordable basic health care throughout China. Given the disparities in China, it is impossible to identify one ideal insurance scheme that will suit the needs of the nation's 800 million rural population. It is clear that the Chinese government needs to continue the experimentation and evaluation with alternative schemes that are suitable to the different needs of the rural population. The impact of rural reform also had significant repercussions on the urban health services. As income of peasants rise, their demand for better quality services places additional burdens on the urban health services. Furthermore, accompanying the rapid growth in the population of the elderly, the demand for services is increasing. Chronic diseases account for two- thirds of disease morbidity and mortality. As medical technology improves, more sophisticated equipment and procedures, though not the most cost effective, are used by the doctors and requested by the patients. At the same time, resources required to provide basic health services are becoming increasingly limited.-27 - China's policy in the past three decades has concentrated on providing access to basic care. The BFDs were provided with short specific training and equipped just to the level needed to give simple medical care. Now, under the national emphasis on technical sophistication, major efforts are being made to retrain the BFDs and to lengthen their initial training. The goal is to bring BFDs up to the standard of middle-level health workers. BFDs who pass the examinations are issued a rural doctor certificate. Thus, the data show an emerging pattern of more professionalized health workers. With a rural doctor certificate a BFD tends to practice mainly curative care. He sees more patients and consequently prescribes more drugs (17). Increased professionalization of the health workers implies higher cost for primary care. These costs are being paid for by the patients out of their own pockets, since the health insurance system that was part of the welfare fund has collapsed. These changes also tend to decrease the level of preventive activities. Without cooperative health insurance, the cost of curative care has become an entry threshold to the poor. A survey in 30 counties in Hubei province indicated that 55 percent of households (up to 63 percent in mountainous, poorer areas) indicated that price was too high and unaffordable as a reason for not seeking health care when needed (18). Although new finance schemes are being tried in various provinces, charging a fee for services has become the dominant financing mode, and there are reports of over-prescription and inappropriate mark-ups of drugs in an attempt to increase profit. How can China address these problems? It does not suffice to say that there are definite regional variations in mortality rates, health service-28 - infrastructure and health resource availability. For a country with over 1 billion population, the regional disparities are large and they are increasing. Sothere is not one prescription for the country. How can China finance its own health care delivery? Data show that the richer provinces or regions can afford and are willing to pay for a spectrum of interventions-- from health maintenance, primary and secondary prevention, curative care to rehabilitative care. Health insurance schemes for minor and major risk pooling is doable and desirable. In these areas, the elderly are even willing to purchase additional medical care insurance after retirement. But the poorer regions and provinces have no choice but to rely on some combination of subsidies and fee for service. China is in a position to avoid the errors that many developed and developing countries have made in putting all available resources into curative care, while ignoring preventive care and public health measures to improve community environmental hygiene and to control communicable diseases. In all cases, China should not lose its focus on preventive care. As recognized now by the developed countries, single pursuit of advanced curative technology will not decrease mortality nor morbidity of the population. A balanced mix of strategies is necessary. In 1979, the surgeon general of the United States published Healthy People, Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, which represented an \"emerging consensus among scientists and the health community that the nation's health strategy must be dramatically recast to emphasize the prevention of disease\" (19). This was followed in 1980 by a report, \"Promoting Health, Preventing Disease\", which set out objectives for improving the health of the population (20). The same year a Canadian task force published a major report recommending \"health protection packages\" for-29 - each stage of life--combination of screening tests, vaccinations and counselling to prevent disease (21). Educational campaigns to encourage people to exercise, quit smoking, and adopt other health practices have been launched in several European countries (22). One way to secure the prevention focus is through training. China has shown its capability to train a large number of BFDs, the single largest group of community health workers in the world, to focus on the pressing issues the nation faces, to serve every man, woman and child, and to provide basic care, family planning services and drugs. Today, at a time of rapid technological change in medical science, China needs to train its health workers to focus on appropriate treatment technology and to pursue a spectrum of intervention strategies aimed at different phases of the natural history of diseases, which entails health promotion and maintenance, primary and secondary prevention, restorative care, rehabilitation, extended care and terminal care, rather to focus only on curative care. In addition, government policies should encourage a healthier life-style by individuals, given the evidence that many medical problems are behavioral. China needs to continue to experiment with alternative financing schemes. Research in many countries including the U.S. has shown that copayment can reduce overutilization of health services and that health maintenance organizations which provide both preventive and curative services at a pre-set insurance premium have reduced the cost of medical care without lowering the quality of services. Thus policymakers in China need to maintain a balance between stimulating health care providers to deliver sufficient high quality services without inducing overconsumption of medical care (such as drugs and high technology diagnostics) because of profit motives. In the-30 - relatively well-off areas, experience with user fees needs to be evaluated and in the poorer regions the government needs to continue providing subsidized services. Finally, China urgently needs to examine the varying insurance alternatives that could provide again accessible and affordable health care to its rural population, which not so long ago has earned China the widely acclaimed reputation for having built a rural health care system that makes primary health care a right of each individual. To maintain this reputation is China's biggest challenge in the health care sector.-31 - ANNEX 1 Reports and Critiques of Health Care Financing Options Carried Out in Various Provinces A. Reform in Government and Labor Insurance and Urban Services JKB, April 3, 1984, no. 2012 Harbin. A district hospital set up a committee to manage government insurance. Central registration files of government members are set up to match member's name and picture. All referrals and transfers require approval by designated doctor. This resulted in lower insurance expenditures with an average of 2.61Y per month per member instead of the standard of 4.25Y. JKB, April 26, 1984, no. 2022 Beijing. Dual charge standards. For government and labor insurance patients, charges are set to cost. This has increased income for the hospital and decreased deficit. Benefits: increased equipment installation for hospitals, enterprise improved management in referral registry to avoid over-transfer of patients. Enterprise hospitals increase investment in upgrading technical standards of health personnel, decrease referrals and transfers to big hospitals from its own health institutions. JKB, August 9, 1984, no. 2067 Tienjin city. Used dual charge system. This has helped to improve quality of hospital service and improve management of labor insurance members, reduced expenditure of labor insurance. JKB, October 9, 1984, no. 2093 Liaoning Province.

Village and township health units are administered under one management: establish a committee which consists of representatives of the township government, township health center, finance planning, senior citizen, industry and agriculture. Town sets the budget for health services. Rural doctor's salary is equivalent to the income of a village official cadre. This increased preventive work provided by rural doctors. C. Preventive Services JKB, July 17, 1984, no. 2057 Guandong, Xini county. Charges labor fee for preventive services. Each child is charged 2Y preventive fee at birth in order to receive all vaccines until the age of 8. This encouraged delivery of preventive activities by BFDs.

JKB, April 19, 1986, no. 2347 Anchiu county, Shangdong. Insurance for immunization preventable diseases: polio, tuberculosis, pertussis, measles, Jap B, and diphtheria. D. Joint Medical Services: \"Conglomeration\" of Services JKB, October 11, 1984, no. 2093 Liaoning, Shengyang city. City/district mine enterprises contract with 12 hospitals to provide regionalized medical services. These medical units were previously scattered small health units, but now function as an integrated system. This allows a hospital to serve as the tertiary hospital, which decreased the outside referral rate from 7 to 2 pervcent. JKB, April 16, 1987, no. 2554 At Northeast province, problems arise with \"joint hospitals\" where a contract was signed between a high level and a lower level hospital. Consultation fee charged by the high level hospital is very high. A technical assistance fee as high as 4000Y per year is becoming unaffordable. In additiion, each visit the lower level hospital pays 10Y for food subsidy and transport, which increased to 48Y from 1986 to 1987. JKB, March 13, 1986, no. 2329 Jiling. Joint medical enterprise: city hospitals link with factory healthunits to set up affiliation and open services for the public.

JKB, November 27, 1984, no. 2114 Issues in health services. (1) appropriate charge of fee; government labor and self-pay need to charge at cost. (2) adjust certain services based on standard/capacity of hospitals. (3) cosmetic surgery should be surcharged to make up for losses in other services. (4) improve living environment. (5) use of responsibility system should not, however, equate quality with quantity. JKB, April 2, 1987, no. 2546 Liaoning. Development of health services must be coordinated to avoid duplication. CT fever: in Liaoning, 26 sets of CT scanners, of which 6 sets are in Shengyang city. Inappropriate cluster of hospitals, 4-5 hospitals, each with over 400 beds, concentrated in the city proper. At every level-- province, city, county and township--set up \"cadre ward\" with sofas and desks in private rooms. Lack of specialization among hospitals; each hospital should expand to provide all specialties. Expansion of beds and equipment is not matched with a simultaneous increase of personnel. JKB, April 4, 1987, no. 2547 Review of appropriate use of drugs. A study conducted by Peking Union Medical College shows that in a survey of 16 hospitals in Shanghai city, of cases received, 26% of outpatients received inappropriate drugs; in Guanzhou city, a survey of 3,020 cases -20% inappropriate drugs; in Changsha, in 311 deaths, 15 cases, 7 hospitals were related to inappropriate use of drugs. Inappropriate combination of drugs accounted for 90% of cases of misuse. JKB, April 4, 1987, no. 2547 Jianxi. Health bureau stresses each region needs to incorporate preventive health maintenance into regular budget planning. JKB, April 4, 1987, no. 2547 Shenyang military medical hospital: stress prevention needs to be incorporated into health activities.

JKB, May 21, 1987, no. 2574 Government insurance expenditures increases every year. In 1978, the expenditure was 2.73 billion. In 1985, 6.5 billion yuan was needed.-39 - JKB, January 8, 1987, no. 2498 On inflation and the need for price adjustment: in Shanghai, 40.6% inflation from the period 1980 to 1985, so hospitals are at 70 million Y deficit after government subsidy. Since 1980, in Cuanzhou, market prices have been adjusted nine times. In Tienjin, price has adjusted every year. In Chongqing, hospitals have responded by adjusting those items which have fluctuated much with high inflation market items. In Cansu, there was an average 50% inflation in market items. JKB, January 15, 1987, no. 2502 Hubei. A survey of 1,189 households in 30 counties was taken for reasons why they were not seeking care: (1) 55% can't afford it -price too high; 62.9% of mountainous areas indicate price as a reason for not seeking care. Rural doctors seek provide -give unnecessary high numbers of prescriptions. (2) 27.8% believe they can postpone illness and will spontaneously resolve. (3) 12% are concerned about low technical level of BFD, hence seek care at hospital when they really have to. (In Hubei, one-third of BFDs do not reach rural doctor level.) JKB, January 17, 1987, no. 2503 Heilongjiang. Industry owns one-half of total hospital beds, utilization only 71%. Since 1981 start to socialize these facilities for public use, utilization increased to 77%. In 1987 begin \"one system management\", provincial city and industrial health services unified, increase availability of beds by 2884, equivalent to an increase of six 500-bed hospitals. Emphasis on rural health: one-third of collective health stations dissolved since the responsibility system, preventive activities decreased. Last few years major emphasis placed to consolidated 28,000 rural doctors; now collective health station is available in 85% of villages. JKB, February 11, 1986, no. 2309 Critique of township health centers: need to increase technical skills, manpower development, management, and decrease numbers of beds by changing to observation beds. JKB, March 16, 1986, no. 2328 Problems with private practice. A Beijing private doctor advertises for his expertise. An evaluation for anemia resulted in 7 prescriptions.

With 3 major price deflations in the past, the price of medical service still at 35-43% of cost. County and above facilities: each hospital day lose 3-6Y, each operation lose 20-30Y, Beijing Children's Hospital subsidized 92 cents (not including salary) for each outpatient visit hospital. JKB, November 2, 1986, no. 2460 Editorial. Enterprise administered hospital units account for half of counties available resources, health manpower account for one-third, beds account for one-quarter, but not fully utilized, utilization rate at 50% for enterprise hospitals; so unit based administration cannot adequately optimize existing potential. JKB, November 4, 1986, no. 2461 Editorial. Thoughts on reform of health services. Inequity: urban/rural, labor/peasants. Estimate 40% of labor/government fee wasted every year about 2 billion Y. Recent changes: capitation to outpatient fee, save money, hospitals which require copayment can save money. JKB, November 18, 1986, no. 2469 Hebei. Over 10% decrease in rural doctors over the last few years (8,638 rural doctors in 1981 to 7,614 in 1986). Low salary secondary to responsibility system, no subsidy, low technical skills. JKB, November 25, 1986, no. 2473 Heilongjiang's health strategy: upgrade training of all health workers, increase salary of rural doctors, increase investment in prevention activities, increase township health center's resource allocation to preventive activities. Popularize health education in secondary schools. JKB, December 13, 1986, no. 2483 Guanxi. Between 1980 and 1984, in every year government insurance expenditure exceeded 50%. In Yunan province, government insurance increased by 88% from 1980 to 1985. Reasons: (1) materials inflation, average cost of materials (1984/1979) increased by 38%; coal increased 200%. (2) inflation of drugs: Jiangsu (1985/1978) drug cost increased by 76%. (3) increased number of government insured workers.
