BY YELENA MOROZ ALPERT BUILD A FOUNDATION Start your mornings in Tadasana (Mountain Pose) to feel grounded and steady during fall's unpredictability. \"Mountain Pose is solid and enduring and represents the potential for dealing with anything,\" says Joyce Englander Levy, director of Mindful Movement. \"It's a reminder that you can cultivate a broader vision for your life.\" Build the pose from the ground up: Anchor your feet, stand tall, and hold your gaze at the horizon or into your own eyes in the mirror. Breathe mindfully for 5-10 breaths, or until you feel a sense of confidence. If at any point of the day you feel overwhelmed, revert to Mountain Pose for 5 more breaths. SAVOR THE SUNLIGHT Tempting as it may be to hunker down indoors when it gets chilly, sunlight helps sync your body with the natural rhythm of the changing weather. \"Natural light lets your brain and your hormones know when it is time to wake or go to sleep,\" says Amanda Carney, director of Health Coaching. \"Exposure first thing in the morning supports this cycle and can positively affect your mood, energy levels, and mental clarity throughout the day.\" When natural light hits your retina, it sends a direct message to your brain that triggers alertness. A few minutes outside, even on a cloudy day, provides tangible benefits. TAKE TULSI \"In Ayurveda, tulsi is considered a rasayana \u2014an \"It enhances the body's power to withstand the negative impact of stress and helps restore normal physiological functioning.\" To help boost your immunity this fall, try this homemade tulsi supplement: Mix 1 tsp honey, \u00bc tsp ground black pepper, and \u00bd tsp tulsi leaf powder until ingredients bind together. Take once a day, preferably in the morning, about an hour prior to breakfast, Ajmera says.
