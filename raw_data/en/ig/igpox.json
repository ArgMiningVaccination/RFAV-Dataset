I am very happy with my \"Luminous\" customized facial serum. My skin is bright and less lack luster. I am actually surprised sometimes when I am passing a mirror and look at my skin remember that I don't have any makeup. I am almost 40 years old I now have better skin than I have ever had in the past. I will not be without this! Lori J. Our family of 5 has all switched to Deozein Zest deodorant and we could not be happier. Controls odor better than any clinical brand we tried and we hardly sweat anymore! Love the change we made! Happy to have left the waxy film of deodorant behind forever!! Rozina D. Love love this oil (SV23). I have very oily skin which is prone to cystic acne. I am 46 years old. I was hesitant to use this produce since it's nothing but oils. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that my skin soaks this up. I use 5 drops of this every night and mix it with Sea Tonic so as to spread it evenly throughout the skin. I love it!! \"This is the only product I have been using and I am absolutely obsessed with "}
