Even children are suffering from stress and anxiety at a younger age than ever. So what gives? In my [telehealth functional medicine clinic](https://drwillcole.com/), I consult people on a daily basis on how to recognize the signs of stress and anxiety and exactly what to do to heal naturally. One way is through natural supplements. Before we take a look at my favorite supplements, let's learn a little bit more about stress and anxiety.

What happens when you're stressed? Our bodies are built for stressful events. When our ancestors were chased by predators, the sympathetic nervous system responded by switching the body into fight-or-flight mode. During this stress response, the adrenal glands release cortisol, which increases blood pressure and blood sugar for faster response and better survival. When the predators were gone, cortisol decreased, and so did blood pressure and blood sugar levels. Normal balance was restored. Ongoing stress however acts as a predator, but because it never goes away neither does that heightened chemical state. This constant stress signal can cause intense adrenal fatigue, affecting your energy and health along with a slew of other health problems. Symptoms of high-stress levels Even though your body is resilient, there is only so much it can take before it reaches its boiling point. Oftentimes, symptoms that you might consider \"normal\" or a part of the aging process, aren't actually normal at all and is your body crying out for help. If you have any of these symptoms, you might be dealing with chronic stress: - Fatigue - Irritability - Trouble sleeping/insomnia - Skin problems (rash, eczema, acne) - Constipation - Diarrhea - Nausea - Frequent headaches or migraines - Thinning or losing hair - Frequent illness - Low libido - Irregular menstruation - Brain fog Can I take supplements for anxiety and stress? While your lifestyle plays a major role in your stress and anxiety levels, dietary and nutritional deficiencies can also play a large part. In fact, multiple studies have directly linked deficiencies in specific nutrients to higher rates of stress and anxiety due to their role in neurotransmitter function, inflammation, and cortisol levels. Your body's brilliant biochemistry requires specific fuel to ensure all systems function properly. When one thing goes awry, it can impact the whole picture. If you want to learn more about what mechanisms influence anxiety, stress, and depression, along with more natural tools to overcome stress beyond supplementation, check out my article [here](https://drwillcole.com/functional-medicine/underlying-causes-of-anxiety-depression-and-natural-remedies-to-try). The best supplements for anxiety and stress What can I take to relieve stress? This is a common question I get in my telehealth functional medicine clinic. Dietary and lifestyle changes are going to be foundational in your journey to better health, but supplements are often necessary when looking to overcome certain health problems - especially stress and anxiety. What vitamin is best for relieving stress is going to be unique to your case, but these are my favorite supplements for stress and anxiety that I have seen be the most beneficial. - Ashwagandha Ashwagandha can help regulate your body's stress hormone, [cortisol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573577/) which can make you feel calmer and potentially soothe adrenal fatigue by supporting the brain-adrenal (HPA) axis, too. (1) Research shows significant reduction in cortisol levels and self-reported stress and anxiety symptoms in those taking ashwagandha. My supplement [The Brain-Adrenal Balancer](https://drwillcole.com/product/brain-adrenal-balancer) features a curated blend of clinically tested and proprietary herbal blends and nutrients including an optimized form of ashwagandha and other stress-relieving adaptogens, making it one of the best supplements for anxiety symptoms - Mucuna pruriens This bean extract is packed with L-DOPA, which is the precursor to the neurotransmitter dopamine. I call this nature's chill pill, one of the best natural supplements for anxiety and stress. - CBD CBD does wonders for anxiety without the need for the psychoactive compound THC. In order to lower anxiety, CBD [increases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3817535/) prefrontal cortex activation and lowers activity in the amygdala - two areas of the brain involved in anxiety. (2) It also helps your brain generate new neurons through [hippocampus neurogenesis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23298518) to restore balance to GABA and glutamate levels that contribute to anxiety. (3) - Zinc [Research has correlated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3738454/) an imbalance of zinc and copper, or more specifically, increased copper and decreased zinc - with symptoms of anxiety. (4) That's likely because this trace mineral ratio is responsible for proper neurotransmitter function as well as adaptation to stress. - Rhodiola One of my favorite supplements for anxiety and stress is Rhodiola. This adaptogenic herb does wonders for relieving chronic stress due to its superstar compounds, rosavin and salidroside. Rhodiola is so beneficial for stress with one study [showing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26502953/) that daily supplementation was able to greatly reduce anxiety and stress in as little as 2 weeks! (5) - L-theanine You can get this amino acid as a supplement or through drinking green and black tea where it is abundant. Studies have [long shown](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31412272/) (6) its ability to lower stress and anxiety with one [study ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26797633/)in particular highlighting the stress-reducing and cortisol balancing benefits of l-theanine in tea form. (7) - Magnesium When talking about the best supplements to relieve stress you can't forget about magnesium. Not only does magnesium help to regulate cortisol levels to alleviate stress, it also helps calm down the excitatory NMDA receptor in the brain to keep [anxiety](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048670802534408) levels in check. (8) Supplementing with this nutrient can make a huge difference considering up to 90% of the population is deficient. Magnesium supplements are not all treated equally as a lot have poor bioavailability. If you are looking for a magnesium supplement to help with stress, sleep, and mood, my supplement [The Magnesium](https://drwillcole.com/product/the-magnesium) is formulated with Albion chelated magnesium plus MagteinTM (magnesium L-threonate), the only form of magnesium proven in animal studies to cross the blood-brain barrier. - B vitamins If you are asking yourself \"what vitamin is good for stress and anxiety?\" look no further than B vitamins. B vitamins are necessary for various areas of your health including brain function and mood. Research has long concluded that B vitamins are [required](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10468649/) (9) for a healthy stress response and brain-adrenal axis while also acting as [fuel](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24365359/) for neurotransmitters like GABA and acetylcholine that relieve anxiety. (10) When choosing a B-vitamin supplement, a B vitamin complex like my supplement [The Methylator](https://drwillcole.com/product/the-methylator) is best as it contains activated forms of the different types of B vitamins your body needs. - Vitamin D Vitamin D is one of the few nutrients that every single cell of your body needs to thrive. However, most people are deficient in this vital nutrient that is needed for healthy hormones and brain function. Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to [sleep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3866235/) (11) and [mood disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3537724/) (12) with research [showing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30665436/) that vitamin D supplementation - especially when coupled with probiotics - can help improve stress and anxiety. (13) You can get vitamin D through food but it's difficult to get enough to overcome deficiencies and overcome symptoms of stress. Since vitamin D and vitamin K2 - another popular nutrient deficiency - enhance absorption of one another, I formulated [The D3-K2](https://drwillcole.com/product/the-d3-k2) to take advantage of vitamin synergy with highly bioavailable and bioactive forms of these nutrients. - GABA GABA stands for gamma-amino butyric acid and is your body's signal to calm down. In anxiety, your brain's cells get overly excited and boost their activity, much like a child on a sugar high. Certain neurons known as GABAnergic neurons, release GABA in the brain to calm down these hyper neurons. Your body naturally produces and regulates GABA. However, this process sometimes malfunctions, causing GABA levels to decrease, and anxiety, depression, and insomnia to increase, making supplementation beneficial. - Valerian root Valerian is an herb that has been used for years as a natural solution to anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Although more studies need to be done to determine its long-term effectiveness, research has shown that valerian can be [helpful](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5938102/) at alleviating stress and anxiety with few side effects - one being drowsiness so talk to your doctor before taking. (14) The active compound valerenic acid in Valerian also has the [ability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7979830) to increase GABA. (15) - Lemon balm Studies around this herb are newer but have continually shown lemon balm's ability to lower stress and [improve](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/6/11/4805/htm) mood. (16) This could be due to lemon balm's antioxidant rosmarinic acid content which is responsible for [increasing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711310000280) GABA by inhibiting the 4-aminobutyrate transaminase enzyme which is responsible for contorting GABA to L-glutamine. (17) Lemon balm is generally safe but can interact with some medications so it's always good to check with your doctor before taking. - Omega-3 fatty acids Omega-3s are responsible for keeping your brain and hormones happy and healthy with studies showing that omega-3s were able to significantly [reduce](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC538287/) stress after just 6 weeks of fish oil supplementation. (18) - Saffron This rare spice does so much more than enhance the flavor of your cooking. Saffron has powerful mood boosting abilities with studies [showing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15707766) (19) it to be just as effective as the commonly prescribed SSRI, fluoxetine, to alleviate depression. It is also able to [lower](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21242071/) cortisol levels. (20) - Chamomile The ultimate calming tea, chamomile is an easy and delicious anti-anxiety medicine. This soothing, mild tea [was shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22894890) to significantly decrease anxiety symptoms in just a few weeks of regular use. If you don't like tea you can also find it in supplement form. (21) Finding the right supplements for your unique needs Everyone has different triggers for their stress and anxiety.
