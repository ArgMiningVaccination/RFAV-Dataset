Now - page 22 An overview of our biotechnology solutions. 2 3Addressing global challenges through science & innovation.The modern world is caught in the crossfire of a number of converging megatrends: population growth, increasing natural resource scarcity, and a growing demand for the sustainable production of healthy food, feed, nutritional ingredients, and medicines. Tackling these challenges might seem like a tall order, but it's actually a very realistic and achievable goal when we make use of nature's toolbox, like microorganisms. Through biotechnology and biomanufacturing, we can use these microorganisms to develop products and solutions that allow us to feed a growing population more sustainably, while supporting with reducing food loss and waste, fighting climate change, avoiding natural resource depletion, and preserving biodiversity. 4 5Why. 6 710bn 821 m40m $940 bn Population growth Hunger vs obesityNon-communicable diseases Food loss & waste The world's population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050 - and with this comes increasing consumption of natural resources. Our demand for natural resources is expected to triple from 50 billion tons in 2014 to 130 billion tons by 2050 - an overuse of the earth's total capacity by more than 400%. Source: United Nations, 2019 Over 821 million* people suffer from hunger, while over 2.3 billion people are overweight.** Another 1 billion people are suffering from \"hidden hunger,\" consuming food that is deficient in micronutrients such as the vitamins and minerals required for growth and development. Sources: * Food & Agriculture Organization of the United States, 2019 ** World Health Organization, 2018Non-communicable diseases like heart disease, stroke, and cancer are now the leading cause of death around the world, causing 40 million people to die every year - the equivalent of 70% of all deaths worldwide. Source: World Health Organization, 2021 The world's annual food waste bill is US$940 billion - and food waste also accounts for about 8% of total global greenhouse gas emissions, ecosystem degradation, and biodiversity loss. Source: Food & Agriculture Organization of the United States, 2019The production of bio-based products and solutions is often based on fermentation, which involves the use of microorganisms like yeast, fungi, or bacteria. These microorganisms, or microbes, are invisible to the naked eye but are considered the most versatile creatures on earth. They have populated our planet for over 3.5 billion years, performing essential functions to help sustain natural life cycles. They are highly adaptable, they can live under extreme conditions, and they are great chemists. So it's not surprising that humans have been harnessing the power of microorganisms for thousands of years. Traditionally, we've used microbes to make and preserve foods like cheese, yogurt, bread, kimchi, beer, and wine. Much of this traditional fermentation technology is still performed today, but in a more modern way. Nowadays, fermentation takes place at industrial scale in large stainless steel vessels, resulting in better and more consistent quality and safety. Also known as industrial biotechnology, these processes enable the development of products including baker's yeast, savory yeast extracts, and dairy cultures for the production of cheese and fermented milk products.What. 8 9How old is the use of fermentation by humans? The earliest archaeological evidence of fermentation is the 13,000-year-old residue of a beer with the consistency of gruel found at the Raqefet Cave in northern Israel. The beer would have been used by the semi-nomadic Natufians for ritual feasting. Other evidence of a fermented alcoholic beverage (made of fruit, honey, and rice) from Neolithic China dates back to 7,000-6,600 BC. 13,000 years of brewing using fermentationBiotechnology is a key enabler as we work towards these challenges.Biotechnology supports the development of sustainable and bio-based products, processes, and services that are safe, healthy, and scalable.10 11During these 150 years, many acquisitions and partnerships supported DSM's transition into a global, purpose-led leader in biotechnology - specializing in solutions for health through nutrition. Nederlandsche Gist- & Spiritusfabriek (Eng: Dutch Yeast and Ethanol Factory) founded by Jacques Van Marken, industrial biotechnology pioneer. Nederlandsche Gist- & Spiritusfabriek becomes Gist- Brocades.DSM acquires Roche's Vitamins and Fine Chemicals division in Switzerland, ultimately developing fermentation processes for vitamins including Vitamin B2 and Vitamin C.Establishment of Avansya, a joint venture between Cargill and DSM, to produce calorie- free sweeteners through fermentation.Establishment of Olatein, a joint venture between DSM and Avril, to develop plant- based protein.DSM invests in TU Delft's artificial intelligence (AI) for biosciences research lab, called AI4B.io, to develop a deeper understanding of how AI can improve efficiency and effectiveness in developing bio- based products and production technologies.DSM acquires Martek (USA), broadening the spectrum of algae-derived specialty lipids.Hoffmann- La Roche founded by Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche. From early on, the company was known for producing various vitamin preparations and derivatives.DSM was established by the Dutch government to mine coal reserves in the Southern Province of Limburg.DSM acquires Gist-Brocades.DSM acquires Microbia (USA), a research facility developing high-quality, bio-based food and feed ingredients.DSM becomes founding partner of Planet B.io, a scale-up ecosystem for biotechnology start-ups located at the Biotech Campus Delft. DSM acquires Glycom (Denmark), the world's leading supplier of human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) for early-life nutrition applications; CSK company; and Erber Group's Biomin and Romer Labs (Austria) to strengthen our specialty animal nutrition with mycotoxin and gut health solutions.Establishment of Veramaris\u00ae, a joint venture between DSM and Evonik, to produce omega-3 fatty acids for animal nutrition from microalgae. 1869 1896 1902 1968 1998 2010 2011 2019 2020 2020 2020 2021 2003 2018With over 150 years of history, DSM has already developed an extensive portfolio of sustainable solutions that help address the challenges facing modern society. Biotechnology enables purpose- led innovations We start with Pathways to produce macro- and micronutrients. This is our history and our base strength, where we combine our chemistry and biotechnology capabilities. Our process solutions produce ingredients and intermediates from renewable resources cost-effectively and with a low environmental footprint. One example is our bio-based vitamin and carotenoid platform, which delivers bio-based products with health benefits for humans and animals at competitive costs in a sustainable way. In our Prevention pillar, we have a rich portfolio of active ingredients that help to maintain and improve the health of people and animals. As we learn more about how our ingredients modulate the gut microbiome, for example, we see potential to develop solutions that build people's and animals' resilience to stress and disease. Meanwhile, our bio- preservation cultures, combined with DSM starter cultures, probiotics, and enzymes, offer solutions that can significantly reduce food loss and waste in fermented milk products like yogurt. However, we are much more than an ingredient company. We also provide solutions. Our Proteins theme addresses the question of how to meet the protein demands of a growing global population sustainably, by enabling the lowest possible footprints for animal protein production, and providing alternative protein solutions for human nutrition. Finally comes Precision . With increasing insight into the microbiome function and the application of advanced analytical tools, we develop novel ingredients and digital solutions that allow precise nutritional interventions and thus create health benefits for humans and animals. 12 13During 150 years of industrial-scale biotechnology, DSM's experts have brought countless innovations to the world. Today, we are considered one of the top global innovators in the industry. Going forward, DSM has identified four strategic growth themes based on global megatrends, linked to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), that will give direction to the future of nutrition R&D and innovation at our company. DSM has created a strong platform for growth and is ideally positioned to capture the growth opportunities offered by the global megatrends and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).Pathways PreventionProteins Precision15 Developments in biotechnology and digital transformation For instance, two key technologies behind many biotechnology developments of the past 30 years are the \"reading\" and \"writing\" of DNA. While early human full-genome sequencing would require more than 600 scientists from over 100 laboratories, a typical lab nowadays can read tens of human genomes per day. The development of the COVID-19 RNA vaccines in just a matter of months in 2020-21, for example, could not have been done without the technology behind the reading and writing of DNA. Similarly, exponential improvements in the speed and cost of DNA synthesis are enabling scientists to adapt and modify microorganisms in a safe and efficient manner, allowing them to produce new bio-based products, applications, and manufacturing processes. Meanwhile, other emerging technologies - such as robotization, advances in mathematical modeling, digital twins (a virtual mirror of a real-world product or process), and AI - allow us to further reduce the time and cost of bringing new solutions to our customers. Integrating these technologies reduces the time spent on R&D and innovation cycles, from prototyping to scaling and to commercialization. These technologies will add great value to society in the years to come. Producers of food and feed will be able to deliver healthy, sustainable products - more efficiently, affordably, and quickly than ever before.Developments in our understanding of biology, as well as major advances in adjacent research fields such as data science and modeling, are opening up exciting new possibilities for new bio-based products, applications, and manufacturing processes. Disruptive biotechnology research recognized with Nobel Prizes Technological progress in the field has been mind-boggling. A particularly interesting development is directed evolution. Based on the principles of mutation (which happens naturally, but can also be accelerated in the lab) and selection, this technology enables scientists to optimize enzymes - the proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions - for specific bioproducts. In 1993, Professor Frances Arnold from the California Institute of Technology conducted the first directed evolution of enzymes. The applications of her results include more environmentally friendly manufacturing of chemical substances, the production of renewable fuels and the creation of superior enzyme products for food processing. Arnold was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018. More recently, CRISPR-based genome editing - invented in 2012 - has once more advanced the field of biotechnology. The CRISPR- enzyme acts as programmable \"molecular scissors,\" enabling very precise adaptations in the genome of a living cell, just like nature does it, without leaving traces of the genetic engineering behind. The pioneers of this technology, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020. 14Biotechnology competences at DSM.Through our world-class R&D and manufacturing facilities, DSM possesses the full range of biotechnology and biomanufacturing competences. These enable us to identify and develop new molecules, applications, and processes - and to commercialize them at scale. How. 16 171. Screening Developments in biotechnology often rely on screening and selecting suitable high-performance microorganisms. These can be screened from microbial culture collections, classical mutagenesis, and evolution experiments or strain improvement programs. Automation and miniaturization are increasingly important to further optimize this process. 2. Strain development Our scientists carry out strain development to make the selected organism fit for use, using classical (non-genetic modification) breeding tools as well as the latest genetic modification technologies. 3. Bioprocess development Bioprocess development deals with bringing biotechnology innovations to factories. Upstream bioprocessing involves selecting feedstocks and cultivating microorganisms to manufacture bioproducts in large stainless steel vessels. Subsequent downstream processing is applied to secure good bioproduct yield and quality after purification and formulation within required specifications. 4. Biochemistry and microbiology Biochemistry and microbiology provide insight into how enzymes and microbes function on a molecular level. Together with our food application science, they enable the application of bio- products such as enzymes and microbes. Moreover, insights in microbial populations, so called microbiomes, in gut and on skin are applied for developing novel applications for Precision Farming, Personal Care and Personalized Nutrition. 5. Bioinformatics and modeling DSM's bioinformatics and modeling team supports the development of our strains, processes and applications. They draw on a wide range of scientific and technological specialisms, including DNA and genomics data interpretation, advanced computational models, and smart protein and pathway design methods. 6. Analysis With our advanced analytical technologies, we generate insights to steer strain, process, application, and product development as an important facilitator of our biotechnology innovation cycles.

Now it has also become a crucial part of DSM's taste toolbox for meat alternatives. As such, this solution continues to enable food producers everywhere to seize commercial opportunities and raise the bar for performance. MAXAROME\u00ae SELECT Whether because of concern for the environment or concern for one's health, plant-based diets - including vegan, vegetarian, and flexitarian diets - have grown in popularity in recent years. This has driven up the consumption of alternatives to meat and dairy by a broader set of consumers. This trend has brought both opportunities and challenges for food producers, who must deliver alternatives with the best taste and texture possible, while keeping salt, sugar, and fat low to promote the health benefits of their products. Enabling a range of superior meat alternativesPurpose led By helping keep salt, fat, and sugar low in final products without compromising on taste or texture, Maxarome\u00ae Select is enabling people everywhere to stay healthy. Moreover, since this yeast extract is produced sustainably and helps people shift away from high-carbon-footprint diets, it has a positive impact on our environment at large. Finding the sweet spot Produced by a joint venture of DSM and Cargill, called Avansya, manufacturers and consumers are being given access to EVERSWEET, a great-tasting, zero-calorie, non-artificial sweetener based on stevia. Applying the partners' combined know-how of biotechnology and large-scale fermentation- based production processes, Avansya's EVERSWEET sweetener offers consumers a great, pure taste that closely resembles sugar. What's more, it is delivered via a sustainable, scalable fermentation production process that ensures a competitive cost-in-use for food and drink producers. A team effort Because of the strict regulatory requirements for sweetener ingredients, bringing EVERSWEET to market calls for close cooperation with regulators and administrators around the world. Having gained the first approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, the world's largest F&B market, multiple countries have since followed, including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand. The team is also working with regulators in Europe and markets in Asia to bring EVERSWEET to ever more regions and consumers. This process involves a collaborative effort by DSM and Cargill colleagues around the world, and the support provided by regional regulatory experts is crucial.

These enzymes deliver consistent benefits in a range of industrial applications. In particular, Purifine\u00ae PLA1 - launched in June 2020 - is helping to shape the oilseed processing market, enabling a sustainable, high-quality manufacturing process. A win-win for people and planet In particular, Purifine\u00ae PLA1 enables oil refineries to improve cost-in-use, reduce their carbon footprint by 30-35% and consistently reach phosphorus specifications. In addition, it's a hassle-free, safe solution that helps prevent soap formation and centrifuge fouling. As such, this enzyme opens up new horizons for sustainable oil processing - a win for both people and planet.Performance driven Purifine\u00ae PLA1 also helps oil refineries gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace by enabling a 2% extra oil yield, consistently achieving phosphorus specification, and delivering guaranteed product performance. Unlike standard enzyme solutions, Purifine\u00ae PLA1 requires no pH adjustments during processing because of its unique biological profile. PURIFINE\u00ae Feeding the world's growing population within planetary boundaries is a tough challenge. Edible vegetable oils are used in a wide range of foods and provide important nutrients to people around the world, but processing them can be carbon-intensive. Conventionally, producing high-quality oils required water degumming and/or caustic refining, steps that involved significant greenhouse gas emissions and the use of hazardous chemicals. Now, enzymatic degumming is opening up new horizons in sustainability, process efficiency, and product quality. Improving edible oil processingPurpose led By enabling oil refineries to significantly reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprints, Purifine\u00ae PLA1 delivers tangible environmental benefits without compromising in other areas. In this way, the enzyme helps enable healthy food production within planetary boundaries. 34 35 Meeting the demands of a changing world Around the world, consumers increasingly demand foods and product ingredients that are free of artificially created additives, including colorants and preservatives, and have a low environmental impact. Traditional methods for manufacturing carotenoids are often limited by low yields and high amounts of waste, as well as significant environmental impact. To address changing consumer demand, new carotenoid production methods were required. Biotech unlocks a better manufacturing pathway Leveraging its long experience in both biotechnology and consumer ingredients, DSM began investigating the biotechnological production of carotenoids by fungi in the early 2010s. In particular, DSM has marketed and produced the production and sale of high-value natural beta carotene derived from fermentation of the Blakeslea trispora . Over the years, DSM has been able to develop a broad portfolio of natural-source and nature-based carotenoids - pigments with low environmental impact and high functional performance. Performance driven Biotechnology has not only facilitated an environmentally friendly carotenoid production - it's also enabling products that better fit growing consumer demand for products that are manufactured more naturally and with fewer artificial additives. Delivering colorful health benefits in a sustainable way. Purpose led DSM's carotenoids are used in a wide range of dietary supplements, beverages and other food applications and offer important health benefits, such as protecting against degenerative eye diseases and other deficiency-related disorders. In addition, the biotech-enabled carotenoids are developed with a minimal environmental impact, enabling a better life for more people within planetary boundaries. 36 37 CAROTENOIDS Carotenoids are valuable pigments used by a variety of industries, such as food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Some of these pigments act as vitamin A precursors and have powerful coloring and antioxidant properties. Certain carotenoids work as antioxidants in the body to protect cells, tissues, and organs against the damaging effects of free radicals, which may contribute to the development of disorders such as cancer, heart disease and eye diseases.In search of cleaner, more efficient HMO production HMOs have been heavily researched and documented in science for a long time. But until relatively recently, they were too complex to manufacture at scale as HMO production can lead to significant waste, use considerable amounts of water, and prove to be costly. To address these issues, and to help deliver healthy diets for all within planetary boundaries, DSM has leveraged state-of-the-art biotechnology solutions to develop oligosaccharides identical in structure to those in mother's milk. The world's leading HMO supplier Today, DSM is the only fully integrated HMO manufacturer in the world, with its own product development, preclinical and clinical development, regulatory and large-scale dedicated production site. By utilizing a unique combination of biotechnology and bioengineering excellence we develop cost-effective and environmentally friendly HMO production processes that deliver healthy products. Performance driven Biotechnology can enable efficient production processes - both in terms of speed and created waste. As such, DSM's HMO portfolio enables sustainable, cost-effective solutions that can be easily incorporated into different food formulations and solutions. Creating happier, healthier lives with better early-life nutrition. Purpose led By leveraging the possibilities of biotechnology, DSM creates HMOs that support people's health and immunity and enable people to reach their genetic potential - with less than one-tenth of the environmental impact of HMOs manufactured with other commonly applied methods. In this way, we are helping to create brighter lives for all. 38 39 HUMAN MILK OLIGOSACCHARIDES Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a collection of carbohydrates that naturally occur in our very first food, mother's milk. In fact, they are the third most abundant solid component of human milk after lipids and lactose. Research suggests that HMO supplements may help to develop a healthy microbiota by serving as a food source for the good bacteria in the intestine, as well as driving immunity. Correct levels of HMO supplementation can provide us with unique health benefits - during childhood and beyond. In particular, HMO supplements can support immunity and gut health, as well as cognitive development. Cleaner, more efficient production with biotechnology To address growing consumer demand for less carbon- intensive products, and more 'natural' manufacturing processes, DSM pioneered a one-step fermentation process to produce vitamin B2 from a renewable source using microorganisms. This process has delivered significant environmental benefits: as shown by eco-efficiency analyses, it has reduced the use of fossil raw materials by 75%, waste water by 67%, and waste gas by 50%. In addition, no hazardous waste is now produced as part of the fermentation process. The rise of vitamin B2 Today, 100% of vitamin B2 on the global market is produced by fermentation, and DSM is a leader in the production of the ingredient. Specifically, DSM supplies vitamin B2 as an application-based formulation, or as a premix ingredient to the food, pharma, and dietary supplements markets. Moving forward, DSM will continue to work with its partners to further optimize the production processes for vitamin B2, with the aim of further increasing its yields and production capabilities, as well as optimizing its environmental impact, in line with growing consumer demand for the ingredient. Performance driven The biotechnology pioneered by DSM has helped improve the efficiency of vitamin B2 production processes, such as by ensuring higher yields and reducing waste by- products, which drives the competitiveness of vitamin B2 manufacturing operations. VITAMIN B2 An essential micronutrient for humans and animals, Vitamin B2 (or riboflavin) plays a vital role in maintaining the body's energy supply, helping it break down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, as well as being necessary for building and maintaining body tissues. Animals and humans are unable to produce many vitamins on their own - these need to be obtained externally from dietary supplements or feed additives. Industrial production of vitamin B2 for these applications was historically undertaken through a seven-step chemical synthesis process, which often delivered low yields and the production of undesirable and/or toxic waste products. Bringing efficiency to vitamin B2 production Purpose led By applying biotechnology to help shift vitamin B2 production to cleaner, more efficient ways, DSM has helped shape a more environmentally friendly vitamin manufacturing industry, and ensured safer production methods that do not discharge any hazardous waste byproducts. 40 41 Bringing a new level of precision DSM has been applying biotechnology to support its Animal Health & Nutrition business since around 2014. Above all, biotechnology capabilities have been leveraged to screen and select suitable high-performance microorganisms and molecules for a variety of animal nutrition applications, such as precision glycans. Through biotechnology, developing effective and precise animal health and nutrition solutions, with improved sustainability profiles, is easier and more efficient than ever. Harnessing the potential of microbiomes In particular, the use of advanced biotechnology-based tools together with digital tools like machine learning, has revealed important insights into, and between, the collection of genes and metabolites from the microbiota, called respectively 'metagenome' and 'metabolome'. Such targeted approaches have opened up previously unthinkable possibilities: modulating pathways to utilize nitrogen or carbon more effectively, reducing emissions, improving welfare and enhancing immunity, beyond what is possible with conventional animal nutrition and health technologies. Performance driven By deepening understanding of microbiota and making interventions more precise and accurate in the product development stage, biotechnology is enabling the development of novel molecules, applications, and processes for the animal farming industry - and commercialize them at scale. Driving more sustainable animal production. Purpose led By applying biotechnology-based solutions to animal nutrition and health, DSM is driving the transition toward more sustainable farming, with a lower environmental impact and higher levels of animal welfare. For farmers, biotechnology is enabling new opportunities to create value and achieve higher levels of income by improving diet efficiency and reducing animal mortality. 42 43MICROBIOTA Animal-based proteins are highly nutritious and form a key part of a balanced, healthy diet. However, the rising demand for animal protein is driving greenhouse gas emissions, while animal health and welfare are increasingly important for consumers around the world. Biotechnology is opening up a range of opportunities to enable animal production that is better for farmers, animals, consumers and the planet - helping to make existing diets more sustainable, and giving increasing numbers of people access to affordable, nutritious food. Detoxification through biotechnology Traditional physical and chemical methods to deactivate mycotoxins have key limitations, including constrained efficacy, safety issues and losses in the nutritional value and palatability of feeds, as well as the significant costs required to implement these techniques. To address these challenges, and ensure safer food and feed, DSM has pioneered biotechnology methods to deactivate mycotoxins, particularly through enzymes that render these compounds harmless in the gastrointestinal tracts of animals. Specifically, microbial enzymes will bio-transform the mycotoxins, converting them into non-toxic metabolites. Better animal health, better farm welfare By ensuring that mycotoxins are not absorbed in the bloodstream of animals, DSM's enzymatic solutions help to prevent these compounds from causing health issues to animals, and - later in the food chain - humans. In addition, these enzymes can be used to aid feed and food processing. In this way, DSM is driving the safety of both feed and food, as well as helping to ensure better-quality food for the world's growing population. Looking ahead, DSM will continue to collaborate with a broad range of scientific partners to further develop its range of mycotoxin risk management technologies. Performance driven By driving animal performance and health, DSM's mycotoxin management solutions also drive the profitability of farmers, and ensure fewer interventions are necessary when looking after livestock. MYCOTOXIN Produced by different types of fungi, mycotoxins are toxic, secondary metabolites that enter the food chain as a result of fungal infection of crops before or after harvest. Mycotoxins can compromise the health and immunity of animals and humans, leading to disease and even death. What's more, mycotoxins lead to severe economic damage: it's estimated they cause \u20ac3 billion of annual crop losses in Europe, and $1.2 billion annual losses to US livestock. As such, managing mycotoxin risk is both a pressing economic and health imperative - strategies to eliminate or deactivate mycotoxins in food and feed are strongly needed. Ensuring safer food and feed through mycotoxin deactivation Purpose led By leveraging biotechnology to mitigate mycotoxin risks in food and feed, DSM is delivering low-environmental-impact solutions to a key challenge to food security and safety, as well as driving positive impacts on animal health and welfare. In this way, these solutions create value for all stakeholders. 44 45 Innovation driven by collaboration In view of these environmental challenges, engineers and scientists from Veramaris\u00ae - a joint venture of DSM and Evonik - have pioneered a sustainable solution: making natural marine algae a high-quality source of omega-3 for aquafeed, replacing omega-3 fatty acids (namely eicosapentaenoic acid EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA) from wild-caught fish. Algal oil by Veramaris\u00ae is highly concentrated and helps resolve the global omega-3 shortage, enabling the continued production of healthy seafood. In fact, 1kg of Veramaris\u00ae oil yields the same amount of DHA and EPA omega-3 as 60kg of wild-caught fish! Bright science in action Biotechnology has played a key role in the development of this collaborative, sustainable solution. Specifically, DSM has expertise in cultivating marine organisms and biotechnology capabilities in development and operations, while Evonik's long-term focus has been on industrial amino acid biotechnology, executing large-volume fermentation processes. Through this collaboration, DSM's biotechnology team has been able to discover, develop, and deliver a unique, cost-effective, natural EPA and DHA omega-3 solution, thereby unlocking a more sustainable future. Performance driven The initial annual production capacity of the Veramaris\u00ae plant meets roughly 15% of the total current annual demand for EPA and DHA from the global salmon aquaculture industry. To drive positive change in feed production and food consumption, Veramaris\u00ae is working extensively with all stakeholders along the value chain, including feed producers, farmers, retailers, and non-governmental organizations. Pioneering collaborations have already enabled key players in aquaculture to raise Atlantic salmon on diets totally free from marine ingredients, using Veramaris\u00ae' algal oil as a complete replacement for fish oil. VERAMARIS\u00ae With the world's population set to reach 10 billion by 2050, fish farming will play an important role in meeting the growing demand for sustainable protein. Fish, especially salmon, is a particularly rich source of omega-3 fatty acids and protein. But the consumption of fish has grown twice as fast as the world's population since 1961. Overfishing has placed extreme pressure on wild fish stocks - indeed, it's the main cause of biodiversity loss in our oceans.A win-win for oceans and healthPurpose led Veramaris\u00ae' commitment encourages industry players to adopt sustainable feed production as a worldwide standard. By advancing an alternative to traditional seafood sources of EPA and DHA, Veramaris\u00ae is contributing to preserving oceans, seas, and marine resources for generations to come. Moreover, Veramaris\u00ae enables healthy animal diets within planetary boundaries and helps meet the omega-3 dietary needs of a growing world population. "}
