Observational studies are being increasingly used to estimate VE. We developed a probability model for comparing the bias and the precision of VE estimates from two case-control designs: the traditional case-control (TCC) design and the test-negative (TN) design. In both study designs, acute respiratory illness (ARI) patients seeking medical care testing positive for in uenza infection are considered cases. In the TN design, ARI patients seeking medical care who test negative serve as controls, while in the TCC design, controls are randomly selected individuals from the community who did not contract an ARI. Methods: Our model assigns each study participant a covariate corresponding to the person's health status. The probabilities of vaccination and of contracting in uenza and non-in uenza ARI depend on health status. Hence, our model allows non-random vaccination and confounding. In addition, the probability of seeking care for ARI may depend on vaccination and health status. We consider two outcomes of interest: symptomatic in uenza (SI) and medically-attended in uenza (MAI). Results: If vaccination does not a ect the probability of non-in uenza ARI, then VE estimates from TN studies usually have smaller bias than estimates from TCC studies. We also found that if vaccinated in uenza ARI patients are less likely to seek medical care than unvaccinated patients because the vaccine reduces symptoms' severity, then estimates of VE from both types of studies may be severely biased when the outcome of interest is SI. The bias is not present when the outcome of interest is MAI. Conclusions: The TN design produces valid estimates of VE if (a) vaccination does not a ect the probabilities of non-in uenza ARI and of seeking care against in uenza ARI, and (b) the confounding e ects resulting from non-random vaccination are similar for in uenza and non-in uenza ARI. Since the bias of VE estimates depends on the outcome against which the vaccine is supposed to protect, it is important to specify the outcome of interest when evaluating the bias. Keywords: case-control study; uenzaShiet al. Page 2 of 31 Background In uenza vaccine e ectiveness (VE) has to be re-estimated in every season because predominant in uenza virus types, subtypes and phenotypes change from one season to the next, necessitating a new vaccine targeting di erent strains in most seasons. As annual in uenza vaccination is now widely recommended, randomized clinical trials for estimating VE are no longer ethical in many populations, and observational studies based on patients seeking medical care for acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) are the most e\u000ecient, and hence most widely used option. However, observational studies for estimating VE are prone to multiple sources of bias. In this paper we present a new probability model for comparing the bias and preci- sion of VE estimates from two popular case-control study designs under nonrandom vaccination, i.e., vaccination probabilities may depend on a covariate. In both study designs, ARI patients seeking medical care who test positive for in uenza infection are considered cases. In the test-negative (TN) design, ARI patients seeking med- ical care who test negative for in uenza infection serve as controls, while in the traditional case-control (TCC) design, controls are randomly selected individuals who did not contract an ARI, usually from the same community from which the cases came. The TN design was introduced in 2007 [1], and most of the in uenza VE case-control studies conducted since then have used this study design. However, TCC studies are still being used occasionally [2{4]. TCC studies are usually costlier and more resource intensive due to the need to recruit controls through a separate mechanism. Estimates of VE from case-control studies may be subject to the following sources of bias: (a) Probabilities of non-in uenza ARI may depend on vaccination sta- tus: In TN studies, individuals with non-in uenza ARI serve as controls. Therefore, TN studies may produce biased estimates of VE unless vaccinees and non-vaccinees are equally likely to develop non-in uenza ARI. The validity of this assumption has not yet been con rmed. De Serres et al. [5] used data from randomized clini- cal trials to argue that this assumption is usually satis ed. However, a randomized in uenza vaccine trial [6] found that vaccinees increased risk of virologically-con rmed non-in uenza infection (that may lead to ARI) as compared to those who received the placebo. (b) Probabilities of in uenza and non-in uenza ARIs may depend on confounders: Covariates such as health status, age, exposure, education and socio- economic status may be associated with both the likelihood of being vaccinated and the likelihood of developing in uenza and non-in uenza ARIs. (c) Vaccination may a ect probability of seeking medical care in in- uenza patients: Several studies [7{9] suggest that vaccinated individuals who contract in uenza may have milder symptoms than unvaccinated in uenza patients, and therefore may be less likely to seek medical care. This e ect of vaccination is not expected to change health-care-seeking behavior of non-in uenza ARI patients. (d) Probabilities of seeking medical care against ARIs may depend on confounders: Since only ARI patients who seek medical care may be included in a TNC study, and only in uenza patients who seek care may be included as cases in TCC studies, covariates that are associated with both the likelihood of beingShiet al. Page 3 of 31 vaccinated and the likelihood of seeking care against ARI may contribute to the bias of in uenza VE estimates. (e) Misclassi cation bias: Diagnostic tests for in uenza viruses are not 100% sensitive and speci c. Vaccination status may also be misclassi ed. In this work we consider the rst four sources of bias. To focus on these sources, we ignore misclassi cation biases which are known to result in negative bias (i.e., bias toward lower estimation of VE) and are common to all studies that rely on results of diagnostic tests. The goal of this article is to evaluate and compare the bias and precision of estimates of VE resulting from TN and TCC studies. As we will see, the bias of VE estimates may depend on the outcome of interest, i.e., the outcome against which the vaccine is expected to protect. We consider two outcomes of interest, symptomatic in uenza (SI) and medically-attended in uenza (MAI). In both the TN and TCC study designs, only in uenza patients seeking medical care are considered cases. Therefore, one expects these study designs to produce estimates of VE against MAI. However, the media usually reports VE estimates from these case-control studies as `vaccine e ectiveness against in uenza', without including the `medically-attended' clause. As a result, the public may interpret these estimates as the e ectiveness of the vaccine against any in uenza illness , i.e., VE against SI. One of the objectives of this work is to highlight the importance of (a) clearly specifying the outcome against which the vaccine is supposed to protect, and (b) understanding that the bias of a VE estimate may be di erent form the two outcomes of interest. We will (a) evaluate the bias of each of the VE estimates for each of the outcomes by comparing the expected value of the estimate with the true VE, and (b) evaluate the standard errors of the VE estimates. To perform these evaluations and compar- isons, we developed a detailed stepwise probability model of the process involved in collecting data in these studies and deriving VE estimates. The model includes a covariate, health status, that may be associated with both the likelihood of being vaccinated and the propensity of seeking medical care against ARI. This allows us to assess the e ects of nonrandom vaccination on the bias of VE estimates. Methods We rst describe the real-life process involved in conducting the two types of case- control studies and obtaining the estimates of VE. We then describe the model we developed to mimic this process. The study population The source population for both types of case-control studies consists of all individ- uals receiving most of their medical care at a single clinic or at a speci c network of clinics. Since in uenza VE varies by age, we can assume that the model pertains to a subpopulation corresponding to a single age group. The study designs When a member of the study population develops an ARI, s/he may decide to report to a clinic for treatment. At the clinic, the health care provider may ask the person to be tested for in uenza viruses. If the person agrees then a swab isShiet al. Page 4 of 31 taken and sent to a laboratory for testing. In both study designs, a person who tests positive is eligible to be considered a case. In a TN study, an individual who tests negative is eligible to be considered a control. In a TCC study, controls are randomly selected members of the study population who have not developed ARI prior to their inclusion in the study. Usually, one or more controls are selected right after a case is identi ed. In both study designs, the vaccination status of every case or control is determined from manual or electronic records, or from oral histories. Outcome of interest and true VE In this work we evaluate estimates of VE when the outcome of interest is either SI or MAI. SI is sometimes called `in uenza illness' or `in uenza ARI'. Surveillance for SI is needed in the entire study population, and for persons ill with compatible illnesses, samples of in uenza are taken for veri cation. A person is considered a true case of SI if s/he has an ARI and is infected by an in uenza virus. For MAI, a true case is de ned as a person who is in uenza-infected, develops an ARI, and seeks medical care. In both cases, the true VE is de ned as one minus the ratio of the probability of the outcome of interest in vaccinees and non-vaccinees. Estimation of VE and bias of VE estimates In this work we focus on identifying the main sources of bias and their e ects on the performance of the VE estimates. Some of these biases can be adjusted for in the analysis, but this is beyond the scope of the current work. In case-control studies, VE is usually estimated as one minus the odds ratio (OR) of being vaccinated in cases vs. controls. The bias of the estimate is de ned as the di erence between the expectation of the estimated VE and the true VE. The model The model we developed for comparing the estimates from the two study designs follows the scheme described above with a few simpli cations. We assume that (a) when a person seeks medical care for ARI then her/his probability of being tested for in uenza viruses does not depend on vaccination status, health status, or on the actual cause of ARI (in uenza/non-in uenza); (b) given a person's symptoms and in uenza infection status, the sensitivity and speci city of the test do not depend on the tested person's vaccination or health status; (c) a person's vaccination status is determined without error; and (d) controls in a TCC study are selected at random from all asymptomatic individuals in the study population (See section: The study population). Our model includes a covariate, health status, and we assume that a person's prob- abilities of being vaccinated, developing an ARI, and seeking medical care against ARI may be associated with her/his health status. In this way, the model gener- ates possible confounding e ects linking vaccination status with the probabilities of being included in the study and of becoming a case or a control. The model consists of ve steps, where the value of a single variable is determined at each step. The probability distribution of this variable may depend on the val- ues of the variables from the previous steps. Below we de ne the ve steps, the associated variables, and the probabilities determining each variable's distribution.Shiet al. Page 5 of 31 Step 1: Health Status. A person can be classi ed as \\healthy\" or \\frail\". De ne a binary variable X, where X= 1 for a \\healthy\" person and X= 0 for a \\frail\" person. Denote \u0019=P(X= 1). Step 2: Vaccination. A person may be vaccinated against in uenza. De ne a binary variable V, where V= 1 for a vaccinated person. The probability of being vaccinated may depend on health status; therefore, denote x=P(V= 1jX=x),x= 0;1. Step 3: In uenza infection and ARI. During the in uenza season, a person may become infected with an in uenza virus and develop an ARI. This outcome is referred to as \\in uenza ARI\" (FARI), where \\F\" stands for u. A person may also develop an ARI not resulting from in uenza infection. This outcome is referred to as \\non-in uenza ARI\" (NFARI). We therefore de ne an outcome variable Ywith 3 categories as follows: Y= 0 for no ARI, Y= 1 for NFARI, and Y= 2 for FARI. The distribution of Ydepends on the person's vaccination status, V, and health status, X. We assume the \\leaky vaccine\" model, in which the vaccine provides a reduction in the probability of in uenza transmission to the vaccinated person, rather than complete immunity [10]. Under this model, a vaccinee has a lower probability of becoming infected than a non-vaccinee, but is not rendered completely immune from in uenza infection. Step 4: Seeking medical care for ARI. A person with ARI may seek medical care and, in this case, be tested for in uenza viruses. We de ne a binary variable MwithM= 1 for a person seeking medical care for her/his ARI. The probability of this event depends on Y (only individuals with ARI seek medical care), and it may be di erent for FARI and NFARI patients. In addition, the conditional distribution of MgivenYmay depend on XandV. We number of parameters, we make two simplifying assump- tions regarding the probabilities of seeking medical care: (1) the e ect of health status on probability of seeking medical care does not depend on vaccination status or type of ARI; (2) the e ect of vaccination status on probability of seeking medical care does not depend on health status (but it may depend on type of ARI). De ne a \\standard person\" as a person with X = 0 and V = 0. For a \\standard person\", we we two multipliers: \u000f\u0015= multiplier for x = 1; \u0015does not depend on V and Y. \u000f F= multiplier for v=1 only when y=2; Fdoes not depend on X. \u0015is the ratio of the probabilities of seeking medical care comparing a healthy and a frail person. Fis the ratio of the probabilities of seeking care comparing a vaccinated and unvaccinated in uenza ARI patient.Shiet al. Page 6 of 31 Then,f\u000eyvxgcan be written in terms of \u000eSN,\u000eSFand The multiplier Fre ects the e ect of severity of ARI in an in uenza in- fected person. We assume that vaccination may reduce severity of symptoms, hence a vaccinated in uenza patient may be less likely to seek care than an unvaccinated patient. Step 5: Testing for in uenza infection. Although only individuals who seek medical care for an ARI are tested for in uenza infection, it will be convenient to de ne a binary variable Tas the (possibly unob- served) test result for any person with an ARI, regardless of whether or not s/he is actually tested. De ne T= 1 (T= 0) if a person would test positive (negative) for in uenza if tested. Because of assumption (b) above, the probability of test- ing positive given the person's in uenza infection status does not depend on X, V, orM. Denote y=P(T= 1jY=y) fory= 1;2. Note speci city and 2is the test's sensitivity. In this study, we assume the test has 100% sensitivity and 100% speci city, i.e. P(T= 1jY= 1= 0 and P(T= 1jY= 2) = 2= 1. Figure 1 shows the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the model. Recent papers by Sullivan et al. [11] and Lipsitch et al. [12] discuss the use of DAGs to explore sources of bias of VE estimates from TN studies. A summary of the variables and parameters in our model is given in Table 1. True VE in our model When we evaluate the true VE, we assume that vaccination is done at random , i.e. for true VE we assume that vaccination status does not depend on health status X ( 0= 1= ). The results can be found in Appendix 1.Shiet al. Page 7 of 31 Estimates of VE in our model In both the TN and TCC study designs, VE is estimated as one minus the odds ratio (OR) in the C\u0002Vtable cross-classifying the individuals included in the study, where Cis a binary indicator of case/control status with C= 1 for a case. For convenience, the TN and TCC studies will be represented by the letters A and B, respectively. In a TN study, the case/control variable is denoted CA, where (CA= 1) = (M= 1;T= 1) and (CA= 0) = (M= 1;T= 0). all the probabilities condition on M= 1 as only individuals who seek medical care for ARI are included in the TN study. In a TCC study, the case/control variable is denoted CB. Cases are de ned in the same way as in the TN study, i.e., ( CB= 1) = (M= 1;T= 1) = (CA= 1). Controls are individuals included in a random sample drawn from all the asymptomatic individuals in the study population. In other words, ( CB= 0) is a random subset of (Y= 0). In addition, we de ne a binary variable Bindicating whether or not a person is included in the TCC study, i.e., ( B= 1) = (CB= 1 orCB= 0). The VE estimate is based on the OR in the CB\u0002Vtable when all the probabilities condition in a real-life study, the odds ratios are estimated from the relative frequen- cies of the corresponding events, rather than from their (unknown) probabilities. Therefore, the model-based estimates of VE de ned above are actually the expected values of the observed estimates. For convenience we will continue to refer to them as \\the VE estimates\". Using the parameters de ned above, VEAandVEBcan written The proofs can be found in Appendix 2. Bias and standard errors of estimates The bias of an estimate of VE is the di erence between the expected value of the estimate and the true VE. As the true VE depends on the outcome of interest (SI or MAI), the bias of each estimated VE will be evaluated separately for each of the two outcomes.Shiet al. Page 8 of 31 In Appendix 3 we use approximations based on the \\Delta method\" for the stan- dard errors (SEs) of odds ratios [13] to derive expressions for the SEs of both VE estimates in terms of the parameters and the corresponding sample size(s). For evaluating the SEs we consider the observed odds ratios, where the probabilities are replaced by the corresponding observed relative frequencies. The values of bias reported in the text and tables represent absolute numbers. For example, if the true VE is 60% (i.e., 0.6) and the range of bias (-0.40, -0.20). This means that the estimated VE varies from 0.20 (underestimating the true VE = 0.6 by 0.40) to 0.80 (overestimating the true VE by 0.20). Probability Ratios Next, we de ne a few probability ratios comparing vaccinees and non-vaccinees or healthy and frail individuals. These ratios will be helpful in the presentation of the results (see Table 1 for a full list of the notations used in this paper). \u000f\u001a = 1x 0x, the ratio of the probabilities of NFARI comparing a vaccinated and an unvaccinated person of the same health status. \u000f\u0011 = v1 v0, the ratio of the probabilities of NFARI comparing a healthy and a frail person of the same vaccination status. \u000f\u001a = 1x 0x, the ratio of the probabilities of FARI comparing a vaccinated and an unvaccinated person of the same health status. \u000f\u0011 = v1 v0, the ratio of the probabilities of FARI comparing a healthy and a frail person of the same vaccination status. The parameters \u0015and Fde ned earlier are also probability ratios: \u000f\u0015=\u000eyv1 \u000eyv0The ratio of the probabilities of seeking medical care comparing a healthy and a frail person of the same vaccination status. We assume that this ratio is the same for FARI and NFARI patients. \u000f F=\u000e21x \u000e20xThe ratio of the probabilities of seeking medical care comparing a vaccinated and an unvaccinated FARI patient of the same health status. Table 2 presents the main sources of bias that can be identi ed from our model. The absence of bias A is essential for the validity of the TN design, since the VE estimate from this design is based on comparing the odds of being vaccinated in FARI patients (cases) and NFARI patients (controls). This bias may be a result of virus interference [6] (if vaccinees are more likely than non-vaccinees to contract NFARI, then the estimated VE will be falsely high). Biases B1 and B2 represent the e ects of health status on the probabilities of NFARI and FARI, respectively. These e ects, which are sometimes called the ` healthy vaccinee e ect ', represent the confounding resulting from association of health status with the probability of exposure (vaccination) and the outcome. Bias BS is a special case of B1\\B2. It results when health status a ects both the probabilities of FARI and NFARI but the risk ratios comparing a healthy and a frail person are the same for the both types of ARIs. Bias C represents the e ect of vaccination status on the probability of seeking care in patients with SI. This e ect may be due to less severe symptomsShiet al. Page 9 of 31 in vaccinated persons compared to unvaccinated ones. As stated earlier, we assume perfect sensitivity and speci city of the in uenza test ( 1= 0, 2= 1), as it is well- known that misclassi cations result in negatively-biased estimates of e ectiveness. Results Sources of Bias We rst state conditions for the unbiasedness of the VE estimate based on the TN design . The proofs of these results can be found in Appendix 4. (1) Under random vaccination ( 0= 1), the estimate of VE when the outcome of interest is SI is unbiased if biases A and C are absent. When the outcome of interest is MAI, the estimate of VE is unbiased if bias A is absent. (2) Under non-random vaccination ( 06= 1), the estimate of VE when the out- come of interest is SI is unbiased if biases A, B1, B2, and C are absent. When the outcome of interest is MAI, the estimate of VE is unbiased if biases A, B1, and B2 are absent. It is interesting to note that the absence of any source of bias, the OR-based VE estimate from a TN study is unbiased even if the `rare disease' assumption is not satis ed, while the OR-based estimate from a TCC study is biased. To show this, let's use the following simpli ed notation: = probability of being vaccinated, = probability of NFARI, 0and 1= probabilities of FARI in unvaccinated and vaccinated, respectively, and \u000e= probability of seeking care. Then the true VE is 1\u0000\u001a, where\u001a= 1/ 0is the risk ratio. In a TN study, the probabilities of vaccinated and unvaccinated cases are \u0003\u000e\u0003 1, and (1\u0000 )\u0003\u000e\u0003 0, respectively. The corresponding probabilities of controls are \u0003\u000e\u0003 , and (1\u0000 )\u0003\u000e\u0003 , respectively. Then the OR in the table of case-control status by vaccination status equals to \u001a, i.e. the true risk ratio, implying that the estimated VE is unbiased. In a TCC studies, the probabilities of cases are the same as in the TN study, while the probabilities of vaccinated and unvaccinated controls (individuals without ARI) are \u0003 \u0003(1{ 1{ ) and \u0003(1\u0000 )\u0003(1\u0000 0{ ), respectively, where is the sampling fraction of controls. Hence, the OR in the TCC study is [ \u001a\u0003(1{ 0{ )]=(1{\u001a\u0003 0{ ). is less than\u001a(the true RR) if \u001a >0, hence the estimated VE exceeds the true VE in a TCC study as long as the true VE is positive. Next we explore the magnitude of the e ects of various sources of bias and their combinations. We consider three scenarios for vaccination probabilities (see Table 3). In Table 4 we present the range and the maximum absolute value of the bias of VE estimates resulting from TN and TCC studies under the three vaccination scenarios and various combinations of sources of bias. For these results we used the following baseline values of some of 00and 00 are the probabilities of NFARI and FARI, respectively, for an unvaccinated `frail' person;\u000eSNand\u000eFNare the probabilities of seeking medical care for NFARI and FARI, respectively, for an unvaccinated `frail' person; \u001a is the risk ratio comparing the probability of FARI for a vaccinated and an unvaccinated person - thus, the trueShiet al. Page 10 of 31 VE against SI is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 (60%). The values of 's, 's are based on data from various randomized placobo-controlled trials (see [14], Table A1), and the values of \u000eare based on data from several observational studies. In all the tables, gures and examples, values of VE are presented as fractions, rather than percentages. In the calculations for tables 4 and 5, when a source of bias was present we used a reasonable range for the corresponding probability ratio. When bias A was present, \u001a was allowed to vary from 0.5 to 2.0. For biases B1, B2, and BS, we allowed \u0011 and\u0011 to vary between 0.5 and 1.0, since one would not expect frail persons to have lower probabilities of ARI, compared to healthy persons. For bias C, the ratio Fcould vary between 0.5 to 1.0, since one would expect vaccination to reduce the probability that a person with SI will seek medical care compared to a person with ARI resulting from a di erent pathogen. For bias D, we let \u0015vary between 0.5 to 2.0. For each combination of two or more sources of bias, we calculated the minimum, mean, and maximum of the bias and the absolute values of the bias by allowing the probability ratios that are not xed to vary independently in the ranges speci ed above. For example, when biases A, B1, and B2 are absent, we used \u001a =\u0011 = \u0011 = 1, 0:5\u0014 F\u00141, 0:5\u0014\u0015\u00142. Summary of Results The impact of sources of bias Our model allows us to evaluate the impact of the sources of bias listed in Table 2. Each source of bias is a result of a possible e ect of vaccination or health status on the probability of FARI or NFARI or seeking care. Below we summarize our results for each of the sources of bias. We also use numerical examples to illustrate the magnitude and direction associated with each source of bias. Unless otherwise speci ed, the true VEs against SI and MAI are 0.6 (60%). In each of these examples we assume that only one source of bias is present. (1)Vaccination a ects the probability of NFARI (bias A) \u000fThis bias does not depend on vaccination scenario nor on the outcome of interest (SI or MAI). \u000fEstimates of VE from TN studies may su er from severe bias. \u000fThis e ect also a ects the bias of VE estimates from TCC studies, though to a lesser extent. \u000fExample: As the ratio of the probability of NFARI comparing vacci- nated and unvaccinated persons varies from 0.5 to 2.0, VE estimates from TN studies range from 0.2 to 0.8, respectively, while VE estimates from TCC studies range from 0.67 to 0.50, respectively (Figure 2). (2)Health status a ects the probabilities of FARI and NFARI (biases B1, B2 - the `healthy vaccinee e ect ') \u000fThe bias does not depend on the outcome of interest (SI or MAI). \u000fUnder non-random vaccination, these e ects may result in substantial bias of VE estimates from TN or TCC studies. However, this bias is usually less severe compared to the biases resulting from sources A, C and D.Shiet al. Page 11 of 31 \u000fIf the e ect of health status on the probability of ARI is the same for FARI and NFARI, i.e., bias BS is present, then the TN-based estimates of VE are unbiased. \u000fExample: Suppose that the probabilities of vaccination are 0.8 and 0.4 for healthy and frail persons, respectively. Consider three cases regarding therisk ratios P(ARI in a healthy person) / P(ARI in a frail person): (a) When these risk ratios are 0.5 for NFARI and 0.8 for FARI, then the estimated VEs from TN and TCC studies are 0.51 and 0.67, respectively. (b) When the risk ratios are 0.8 for NFARI and 0.5 for FARI, then esti- mated VEs from TN and TCC studies are 0.67 and 0.72, respectively. (c) When the risk ratios for NFARI and FARI are equal and their common value ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, then estimated VEs from TN studies are always unbiased (i.e., they equal 0.6), while estimates from TCC studies range from 0.63 to 0.73. In Figures 3a and 3b, we set the risk ratio for NFARI to 0.75 and let the risk ratio for FARI vary between 0.5 to 1.0. (3)Vaccination a ects the probability of seeking medical care for FARI, but it does not a ect the probability of seeking care for NFARI (bias C) \u000fWhen this e ect is present then the true VEs against SI and MAI may be di erent as the vaccine directly a ects (reduces) the probability of seeking care in in uenza cases, but not in controls. Thus the estimates' bias may depend on the outcome of interest. \u000fIf all other sources of bias are absent, the bias of VE estimates does not depend on the vaccination scenario. \u000fEstimates of VE from TN or TCC studies may be severely biased when the outcome of interest is SI. \u000fWhen the outcome of interest is MAI, estimates of VE from TN studies are unbiased, while the bias of estimates from TCC studies is usually small and is not a ected by the magnitude of the e ect underlying this source of bias. \u000fExample: Let the ratio R = P(seeking medical care against FARI if vaccinated) / P(seeking medical care against FARI if unvaccinated) vary from 0.5 to 1.0. Then the true VE against SI remains xed at 0.6, while the true VE against MAI varies with R from 0.8 to 0.6. The estimated VEs from TN studies equal the true VE against MAI for all values of R, while the estimated VEs from TCC studies vary from 0.82 to 0.63 (see Figure 4). For example, when R=0.5 then the true VE against MAI is 0.80, and the VE estimates from TN and TCC studies are 0.80 and 0.82, respectively. This translates into severe bias when the outcome of interest is SI but small bias when the outcome of interest is MAI. (4)Health status a ects the probabilities of seeking care against FARI and NFARI (bias D) \u000fThe bias of VE estimates does not depend on the outcome of interest (SI or MAI). \u000fIn the absence of other sources of bias, VE estimates from TN studies are unbiased regardless of the vaccination scenario.Shiet al. Page 12 of 31 \u000fUnder non-random vaccination, this e ect may result in substantial bias in VE estimates from TCC studies. \u000fExample: We assume that the probabilities of seeking care do not de- pend on vaccination status. As the ratio of the probabilities of seeking care comparing healthy and frail individuals varies from 0.5 to 2.0, VE estimates from TN studies remain xed at 0.6 (i.e., they are unbiased) under both random and non-random vaccination. When the probabilities of vaccination are 0.8 and 0.4 for healthy and frail persons, respectively, the VE estimates from TCC studies vary from 0.72 to 0.53 (Figures 5a and 5b). In addition, we found that in some cases the true VEs against SI and MAI are di erent. Hence, the bias of VE estimates may depend on the outcome against which the vaccine is supposed to protect. For example, if the only sources of bias are BS, C, and D then, the VE estimate from TN studies is unbiased when considering e ectiveness against MAI. The same estimate may overestimate the true VE against SI by 0.20 (i.e. 20%). Comparison of the bias of VE estimates from TN and TCC studies: \u000fIf one is concerned that vaccination may a ect the probability of non-in uenza ARI, then one should prefer the TCC study design. However, TCC-based VE estimates may still be biased in this case. For example, when the ratio of the probability of NFARI comparing a vaccinated and an unvaccinated person is 0.5, then the bias of VE estimate from TN study is -0.4 while the bias of VE estimate from TCC study is 0.07. \u000fUnder non-random vaccination, e ects of health status on probabilities of in uenza and non-in uenza ARI (the ` healthy vaccinee e ect ') may bias VE estimates from both study designs. In general, TN-based estimates perform slightly better than TCC-based estimates when this e ect is believed to be the main source of bias. If the e ect of health status is similar for FARI and NFARI then the TN design produces less biased estimates compared to the TCC design. For example, suppose the probabilities of vaccination are 0.4 and 0.8 for healthy and frail persons, respectively. When the risk ratios for NFARI and FARI are both 0.75, then the VE estimate from TN study is unbiased, while the bias of VE estimate from TCC study is 0.07. \u000fIf one assumes that vaccination does not a ect the probability of non-in uenza ARI but one is concerned that vaccinated in uenza patients are less likely to seek care than unvaccinated patients (because of reduced symptoms severity) then VE estimates may su er from severe bias in both study designs when the outcome of interest is SI. In this case, the bias of TN-based estimates may be somewhat smaller than that of TCC-based estimates. This source of bias does not a ect VE estimates when the outcome of interest is MAI! For example, suppose that the ratio comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated FARI cases w.r.t. the probability of seeking medical care is 0.5. When the outcome of interest is SI, then the bias of a VE estimate from TN study is 0.2 and the bias of a VE estimate from TCC study is 0.22. When the outcome of interest is MAI, then the VE estimate from a TN study is unbiased, while the bias of a VE estimate from a TCC study is 0.02.Shiet al. Page 13 of 31 \u000fUnder non-random vaccination, the TN study design is preferable to the TCC design if one is concerned about bias resulting from possible e ect of a person's health status on her/his probability of seeking care against ARI. For exam- ple, suppose that the probabilities of vaccination are 0.8 and 0.4 for healthy and frail persons, respectively. When the ratio of the probabilities of seeking medical care comparing healthy and frail persons is 0.5, then the VE estimate from TN study is unbiased while the bias of VE estimate is 0.12. Precision of VE estimates Table 5 presents the standard errors of VE estimates from TN and TCC studies. From this table we conclude that: \u000fNon-random vaccination may reduce precision of VE estimates. \u000fIf the probability of NFARI is associated with vaccination status, then VE es- timates from TN studies are somewhat less precise compared to VE estimates from TCC studies, although, the di erences in precision were small. \u000fIf the probability of NFARI is not associated with vaccination status, then the precision of VE estimates from TN and TCC studies are similar. Discussion We developed a new model for the evaluation of the bias and precision of in uenza estimates from case-control studies. The new model is more comprehensive than previously suggested models [5,14{18] for the following reasons: \u000fIt allows assessment of the impact of non-random vaccination. \u000fIt incorporates a confounder (health status) which links vaccination status with the probabilities of ARI and of seeking medical care for these ARIs. \u000fBy including parameters corresponding to the probabilities of seeking med- ical care, the model allows us to examine the e ect of association of these probabilities with vaccination and health status on the bias of VE estimates. \u000fThe model allows evaluating and comparing the precision of VE estimates. Some of the sources of bias discussed here have been identi ed and addressed in earlier publications, but, to our best knowledge, none of the previous papers present a comprehensive discussion of all the possible sources of bias that may arise under a given model. In addition, the current model attributes the associations between the various factors involved in estimation of VE (vaccination, contracting in uenza and non-in uenza ARIs and seeking medical care) to an underlying covariate. Previously published models, including an earlier version of our model [14], included parameters representing these associations but these associations were not based on a common underlying factor. Therefore, we believe that the current results and conclusions may di er from those derived from less structured models. Our calculations con rm earlier ndings [15] that when the probability of non- inluenza ARI depends on vaccination status, VE estimates from test-negative stud- ies may be severely biased. However, even when this probability is not a ected by vaccination, VE estimates from the two types of case-control studies consid- ered in this work may su er from substantial bias. In addition to the well-known `healthy vaccinee e ect ' (probabilities of vaccination and of ARI depend on health status), bias of VE estimates may result from heterogeneities in health-care-seekingShiet al. Page 14 of 31 behaviors. Speci cally, if vaccination reduces the probability that an in uenza pa- tient seeks medical care (because her/his symptoms are less severe than those of an unvaccinated in uenza patient) then VE estimates from TN or TCC studies may grossly overestimate the true VE against SI. On the other hand, when the outcome of interest is MAI then the biases resulting from vaccine-related reduc- tion in symptoms' severity are very small. Recent papers [7{9] found evidence of vaccine-associated reduction in in uenza patient's symptoms severity. The e ects of health-care-seeking behaviors on VE estimates from studies in which only ARI patients who seek medical care may become cases need to be further investigated. The results of this work lead to the following conclusions : \u000fIn general, estimates of in uenza VE from case-control studies where only ARI patients seeking medical care are tested for in uenza infection may su er from severe bias, i.e. an absolute bias of 20% or more, especially when the outcome of interest is SI. \u000fThe bias of VE estimates may depend on the outcome against which the vac- cine is supposed to protect. When the outcome of interest is MAI, seeking medical care is a component of the outcome. In other words, the true VE against MAI re ects the vaccine e ect on seeking medical care and on con- tracting in uenza. This explains why true VE against MAI may di er from true VE against SI. When bias C is present, the vaccine directly a ects (re- duces) the probability of seeking care in in uenza cases, but not in controls. As a result, VE against MAI is lower than VE against SI. \u000fIn uenza VE estimates from TN studies are usually presented as `VE against medically-attended in uenza'. However, the media and lay persons may inter- pret these VE estimates simply as the protective e ectiveness of vaccination against contracting in uenza illness, i.e. VE against SI. Health authorities and the public should be made aware of this distinction. \u000fWhen the outcome of interest is SI , the TN design provides valid estimates (i.e., no or small bias) if the following assumptions are satis ed: (a) vaccina- tion does not a ect the probability of non-in uenza ARI, (b) e ects of con- founding variables on the probabilities of in uenza and non-in uenza ARI are similar, and (c) vaccination does not a ect the probabilities of seeking med- ical care for in uenza ARI due to reduced severity of symptoms. When the outcome of interest is MAI , then only assumptions (a) and (b) are necessary for obtaining a valid VE estimate from a TN study. \u000fEstimates of VE from TCC studies have small bias when the outcome of inter- est is SI if assumptions (a) and (c) are satis ed, assumption (b) is replaced by the stronger assumption (b*) of no presence of confounding, and the additional assumption (d) that the probabilities of seeking medical care for ARI are not a ected by potential confounders is satis ed. When the outcome of interest is MAI , then TCC-based estimates of VE have small bias under assumptions (a), (b*), and (d). \u000fIt is important to collect more data on health-care-seeking behaviors of ARI patients and to study the e ects of vaccination and potential confounders on these behaviors. In summary, the test negative design produces less biased VE estimates, compared to the traditional case-control design provided that vaccination does not modify theShiet al. Page 15 of 31 probability of non-in uenza ARI. However, this very popular study design may still produce biased estimates of in uenza VE, especially when the outcome of interest is symptomatic in uenza. One can expect monitored cohort studies , where every study participant reporting an ARI is tested for in uenza infection, to provide less biased estimates of VE against SI. In a future publication we plan to compare the bias of these cohort studies, which are much more expensive, with that of TN studies. Our study has a few limitations: \u000fIn order to focus on bias associated with the study designs, we ignored bias resulting from misclassi cation of infection and vaccination status. \u000fOur model does not account for the dynamics of outbreaks of in uenza and other ARI-causing infections. \u000fWe only consider unadjusted VE estimates as we tried to focus on sources of bias rather than on how one can reduce bias using standard or novel statistical techniques [19]. In the future we plan to improve the model by incorporating dynamics of the related processes. We also plan to use stochastic simulations to assess bias and precision of in uenza VE estimates for other study designs (e.g. cohort studies) and to propose new study designs resulting in less biased VE estimates.

[3]Bias = estimated VE - true VE. The range of the bias is the interval between the smallest and the largest value of the bias (accounting for the sign) using di erent combinations of the model parameters. The sign of bias indicates the direction of the di erence between the estimated and the true VE. A negative sign corresponds to underestimation while a positive bias indicates overestimation. [4]Maximum absolute value of bias is largest di erence between the estimated and the true VE when the sign of the di erence in ignored: . . . Little or no bias (absolute bias less than 0.05), . . . Moderate bias (absolute bias greater than or equal to 0.05 and less than 0.10), . . . Substantial bias (absolute bias greater than or equal to 0.10 and less than 0.20), . . . Severe bias (absolute bias 0.20 or more) Example: Under source of bias A, when the outcome of interest is SI, the TN study (under all vaccination scenarios) has a range of bias of (-0.40, 0.20). This means that the estimated VE varies from 0.20 (underestimating the true VE = 0.6 by 0.40) to 0.80 (overestimating the true VE by 0.20). When the sign of bias is ignored then the greatest di erence between the estimated and the true VE is 0.40, hence the maximum absolute value of the bias is 0.40.Shiet al.

Page 25 of 31 Appendices Appendix 1: True VE`s in our model The true 3: Standard Errors of the VE Estimates For TN study, the approximate standard error of VEAis: were tested for in uenza (M=1), i.e., the total sample size for the TN study. The probabilities ( pA V1,pA 01,pA 11) can be written in terms of the parameters de ned earlier.Shiet al. Page 28 of 31 Base on what we got earlier, we know P(M= 11] the number of controls. The probabilities ( pB 10,pB 11) can be written in terms of the parameters de ned earlier:Shiet al.
