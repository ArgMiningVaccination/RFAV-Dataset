I went to my family homoeopathic doctor as I was suffering from pain, stiffness and cramping pain in both my legs since almost 2months. I thought it was just because of weakness and neglected but when it got worse I had to take medical help. After an hour of questions and physical examination he told me that I could be suffering from an autoimmune disease and ordered laboratory tests. I did the tests recommended and was detected with an underactive thyroid problem. I was prescribed medicine, diet and exercises by my doctor and was asked to keep a regular check on my thyroid hormones. Slowly and steadily my condition improved. My muscle cramps just vanished and my thyroid was back to normalcy. I continued taking the treatment to prevent recurrence. Underactive thyroid is termed as Hypothyroid in medical terms. Hypothyroid occurs when the thyroid gland fails to produce enough thyroid hormones. Hypothyroid is more common in women than men and the incidences increases with age. Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (thyroid gland enlarges and forms goitre), Thyroid destruction following secondary to radioactive surgery, Severe iodine deficiency and Stress are known to cause Hypothyroid. A routine blood test for thyroid hormones would confirm the diagnosis. Unexplained Weight gain, Constipation, Sluggishness, Fatigue; Lack of Energy, Dry skin, Depression, Increased sensitivity to cold, Impaired memory, Hair thinning/ Hair loss, Muscle aches and pains, heavier than normal or irregular menstrual periods and slower heart rate are common signs and symptoms seen in a hypothyroid patient. Homoeopathy for Hypothyroid Homoeopathy helps to produce thyroid hormone naturally by stimulating the immune system and helps in better functioning of the thyroid gland. Homoeopathic remedies work by stimulating the body's own healing capacity by encouraging the body to reactivate hormone secretions. Homeopathy is free from any side-effects. Stress causes hormonal disturbances in the body like thyroid problems which is very effectively treated with homeopathy. Homoeopathy is a mind-body medicine. Homoeopathy treats not only the physical complaints, but also targets the mind and gently restores mind-body equilibrium- thus it treats the patient as a whole. A complete recovery is possible in most cases with homoeopathy. Self help for Hypothyroid Regular checkups are a must and report the changes, if any, to your doctor. Caffeinated drinks and dairy products should be avoided. Regular exercise helps to reduce stress and a high fibre diet often helps in maintaining thyroid function and preventing constipation. Apply a good moisturizing cream to combat dryness caused due to hypothyroid. Consume fruits, dry-fruits, green vegetables, beans and legumes in adequate amounts to combat nutritional deficiencies. Any nutritional supplement should be taken under the guidance of your doctor. "}
