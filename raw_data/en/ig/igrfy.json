Goat's rue (Galega officinalis) is a plant native to Europe and the Middle East. It has been used in herbal medicine to treat tuberculosis and lower blood sugar levels. It's also a popular breastfeeding herb that women use to make more breast milk. Originally used in Europe, the dried leaves of the goat's rue plant were successful in boosting the milk production of cows and goats. Then, in the late 1800s, the plant was brought over to the United States as a food source for livestock. Unfortunately, it wasn't a good crop because of its bitter taste and toxic nature. In its fresh state, it turned out to be harmful, and even deadly to some of the animals. Today, while it's a pretty flowering plant, goat's rue is considered a poisonous weed in the United States.
