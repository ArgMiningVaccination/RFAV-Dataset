Sound Healing is the art of creating and using sound and vibration multidimensionally to heal, balance and align body, mind and spirit. A holographic sound bath is an expansion of sound or music vibration into its sacred geometric, multidimensional and infinite form, bringing the sound to its true and natural state of being. This energy healing process creates an exponential energy or vibration beyond third dimensional understanding. Sound is holographic in nature but for the past several thousand years has only been used in linear form because of our inability to hold and work with its higher vibrational state. Simplistically, you may compare sound as we've known and experienced it through these thousands of years, to a flat two dimensional photo. Whereas in simple terms, holographic sound is like looking at a three dimensional vision with great depth, vast intricacies and magnificent colors. Through our evolving consciousness expansion, and/or ascension work, we are again able to hold this higher vibration. Therefore, these specific spiritually inspired techniques utilizing Holographic Sound have been made available to us once again. Enlumnia developed Couples Chakra Sound Healing into a spiritual art that helps the individuals deeply balance life force energy with the individuals and combined together within the relationship. $299, 90 minutes Enhance your session with an oracle card reading Add 15 Minutes: $45 Healing, Balancing & Aligning as One In the biblical writings of creation, first was the Word (sound vibration), and from the Word all things were created (sound vibration moving into physical manifestation). All things are created from sound vibration. There is a phrase in the Vedas, an ancient text found in India, which is, Nada Bramin, meaning The World is Sound. There is nothing in existence that was not created from and with sound vibration. Sound is the seeded vibration of creation. We create through and with vibration. When there is vibration there is sound. When there is sound there is vibration. The human body resonates to vibration, to various tones. Each part of the body has a specific tone or set of tones that it resonates to. Certain tones represent perfect health or balance. When our body is in dis-ease, we are literally out of tune or vibrating off key. Disharmony can manifest mentally, spiritually, emotionally and physically. Through the use of sound healing and balancing, we can shift the vibration of the diseased or disharmonious area to bring it back into harmony, essentially to heal or balance it, there is nothing magic about this. Sound is extremely powerful and can clear, heal, balance, create and recreate, when properly directed to do so. Our Couples Chakra Sound Healing sessions are customized for each client according to their needs and include setting an intention for the session, the treatment, and a post discussion regarding the experience and next steps. $299 - 90 minutes Enhance your session with an oracle card reading Add "}
