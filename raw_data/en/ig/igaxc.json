Live attenuated vaccines are the gold standard for protection against intracellular pathogens such as <i>Leishmania</i> and there have been new developments in this field. The nonpathogenic to humans lizard protozoan parasite, <i>Leishmania</i> (<i>L</i>) <i>tarentolae</i>, has been used effectively as a vaccine platform against visceral leishmaniasis in experimental animal models. Correspondingly, pre-exposure to sand fly saliva or immunization with a salivary protein has been shown to protect mice against cutaneous leishmaniasis. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we tested the efficacy of a novel combination of established protective parasite antigens expressed by <i>L. tarentolae</i> together with a sand fly salivary antigen as a vaccine strategy against <i>L. major</i> infection. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of different DNA/Live and Live/Live prime-boost vaccination modalities with live recombinant <i>L. stably cysteine proteinases I and PpSP15, an immunogenic salivary protein from <i>Phlebotomus papatasi</i>, a natural vector of <i>L. major</i>, were tested both in susceptible BALB/c and resistant C57BL/6 mice. Both humoral and cellular immune responses were assessed before challenge and at 3 and 10 weeks after <i>Leishmania</i> infection. In both strains of mice, the strongest protective effect was observed when priming with PpSP15 DNA and boosting with PpSP15 DNA and live recombinant <i>L. tarentolae</i> stably expressing cysteine proteinase genes. Conclusion/Significance: The present study is the first to use a combination of recombinant <i>L. tarentolae</i> with a sand fly salivary antigen (PpSP15) and represents a novel promising vaccination approach against leishmaniasis.
