Through cultivating comfort and safety in navigating your inner terrain, you empower yourself to attune to your body's wisdom and evolve with grace through life's changes and challenges. Each treatment is intentionally crafted as an opportunity for you to awaken to your body's messages which can masquerade as symptoms, all while accessing the whispers of intuition that no longer wish to be ignored but instead, be embraced. This is how Rune invites you to reconnect to yourself: mind, body, and soul. WHAT PATIENTS ARE SAYING I have been seeing Dr. Lauren for less than a year, but in that year she's changed my life. She's helped heal my gut, my sleep is better, and my physical pain is gone. Having seen many doctors and specialists over the years, in our first meeting Dr. Lauren pinpointed an issue no one else ever addressed. She took the time to ask me detailed questions and came up with answers everyone else missed. After one acupuncture visit and within three days of following her dietary advice, my chronic pain decreased by 80%! Because of her I walk without pain and have been able to wean myself off many medications. Her care and intuition are unmatched! I highly recommend! \u2014 MF, PORTLAND Rune is not just a retreat for care, but a realm... A realm where you return to yourself through the guided stillness facilitated by Acupuncture. From the gentle application of potent, personalized points, Acupuncture allows you to witness and wander across your inner terrain in a lulled sleep-wake state that soothes your stress response by regulating the nervous system. In doing so, Acupuncture elicits signals of safety to reassure your body that 'it's okay, you can rebalance now.' By inviting it to shift from a highly reactive \"fight or flight\" state to a one that can calmly discern and respond, ie. \"rest and digest,\" each treatment encourages the reintegration of parts of itself that have been disassociated or disembodied. This, in itself, is an insidious source of emotional and spiritual affliction I have observed in those who tend to seek out my work. Many relay a sense of feeling like a stranger in their own body, uncomfortable with what is stirring beneath the surface, feeling \"stuck\" and unable to move forward in the ways they want, both in their health and life. After all...as above so below. They are but mirrors reflecting one another. It is in this liminal space of mystery, of stillness, that the body remembers what it has known to do all along from birth, a knowing that's palpable and kept in the chambers of our bones\u2014the body remembers how to heal. Tissues mend, life-giving energy and blood is encouraged to flow, ethereal and physical blockages begin to dissipate all the while...buried gems of dreams, whispers, suspicions, desires, and intrinsic knowing are released from their vessels of somatic memory. From there, they can finally rise to the surface of your conscious awareness to be heard, honored, and even integrated into your waking life\u2014if you so choose. Therein lies what I refer to as the \"magic\" of Acupuncture. A merging of medicine and mysticism. A coalescing of science and spirituality. At Rune, we welcome it all. Conditions Treated with Acupuncture Acupuncture is recognized by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and World Health Organization (WHO) as being an effective treatment for a variety of health conditions. Emotional Health Chronic Stress + Adrenal Fatigue & Burnout Anxiety & Depression , PTSD & Trauma Recovery Substance Dependency + Insomnia Grief, Feeling \"Lost\" or \"Stuck\",\" Energetic Sensitivity Pain Relief Neck & Back Pain + Fibromyalgia Joint Pain & Arthritis + Headaches & Migraines Acute & Chronic Injuries + Chronic Muscle Tension Post-Operative Recovery Digestive Health Abdominal Bloating & Pain + Irritable Bowel Syndrome Inflammatory Bowel Disease + Acid Reflux (GERD) Nausea & Vomiting + Constipation & Diarrhea Poor Appetite, Indigestion, Food Sensitivities Women's Health Irregular/Painful Cycles Pre-Menstrual Syndrome Harmonizing On/After Hormonal Contraception Fertility Support without or with IVF/IUI Vaginal & Uterine-Related Health Conditions Menopause Support Frequently Asked Questions OFFERINGS ACUPUNCTURE Acupuncture is an ancient healing practice that uses hair-thin, single-use, and sterile needles to promote circulation, mobilize your body's healing response, while supporting the proper functioning of its internal systems. There are 12 main channels that carry energy (qi, pronounced \"chee\") and blood to provide nourishment throughout our body. In a healthy person, the flow of these vital substances are freely moving in a state of dynamic equilibrium. When the flow of qi or blood becomes blocked in one or more of these channels from emotional stress, an injury, or illness \u2014 symptoms of disharmony will manifest physically. Acupuncture works by re-integrating the flow of qi and blood to bring your body, mind, and spirit back to a state of balance. GATHERING | Initial Consult | 1.5 hrs | $185 Your first visit is a consultation-only where we will weave the web of connections between your story, constitution, circumstances, story, and symptoms. Our gathering allows me to listen to what lead you to who you are today and who you want to become: your medical history, how you want to feel, the areas of your health you want to address, as well as your goals for working together. I will familiarize you with how Acupuncture works, what to expect, plus go over potential treatment plans based on your needs. This Consult provides the foundation to gather the information needed to reflect on a personalized diagnosis and approach to care while also giving us the opportunity to feel if we would be a good fit to work together. Should we decide to move forward, I will begin to offer the clarity and tools for your next steps. RITUALS | Returning Visits | 1hr | $150 Your retuning visits are where your story unfolds and reintegration begins. We will gather for an hour, wherein that time I will hold space to listen to what has been surfacing for you in between sessions, ask about shifts being noticed, then provide an extended Acupuncture treatment. In addition to Acupuncture, we can include other related East Asian Medicine therapies to invigorate your healing process. Throughout your process, I will be making suggestions for self-honoring rituals and daily practices that you can adopt to compliment your sessions and extend the benefits reaped within the doors of Rune. This is how, together, we can create sustainable, lasting shifts not only in your symptoms, but your overall well-being. Please wear/bring a change of loose fitting clothes and eat something light prior to each visit. Packages are available upon request. CUPPING THERAPY Cupping gently lifts the skin and connective tissue (fascia) to improve circulation, relieve pain, and reduce stress. By creating a mild pressure, it is akin to a deep tissue massage in reverse. Cups are commonly placed along the neck, shoulders, back, and legs to treat soreness, stiffness, and tension. Given how physical and emotional stress to manifest hand-in-hand, ie. trapped emotions & somatic memory to be stored in the body, I often apply cupping to clear and \"lift\" heavy emotions associated with my client's physical tension. Rune offers Cupping as its own experience or with Acupuncture. CASTING OUT | Cupping Only | 45 mins | $125 CLEANSING RITUALS | Cupping & Acu | 1.5hrs | $175 * * This offerings are available to established Acupuncture patients * TAROT & ORACLE READINGS Since attuning myself to tarot and oracle cards since childhood, I have cultivated a deep connection with their imagery and messages, using them as a tool to clarify my intuition. This is the intention I approach my readings with: they are another guiding modality that can be adopted along one's path to healing. Readings at Rune can be combined with our Returning Acupuncture \"Ritual\" treatments to compliment the evolution that often takes place on a psychological, physical, and spiritual level. I invite you to summon your inner Seer and draw your own cards while reflecting on the messages that resonate \u2014 releasing what does not. By merging the potency of the inward journey offered by Acupuncture with an immersion into the world of Tarot, our Illumination treatment is meant to bright light and awareness to your subconscious knowing, desires, suspicions, and callings. ILLUMINATION | Acupuncture & Tarot | 1.5 hrs | $175 * * This offerings are available to established Acupuncture patients * WHAT PATIENTS ARE SAYING \"Lauren is one of the best practitioners of acupuncture I have known. She is professional, compassionate and intuitive. The environment of Rune is brings a sense of curiosity of the metaphysical realm and reassurance that you are in good hands. Expect to be listened to AND HEARD - two things that are often hard to come by these days in any health care field...Lauren has also made a significant impact in my life that has made me change my outlook on self care, created a scared and personal space, and forming better habits to support myself from the inside out. I would be significantly worse off without her guidance. I would not recommend anyone other than Lauren and would advise anyone considering seeing Lauren for any of her services to keep an open mind (if this is your first time seeking this line of care) but most importantly, you will not be disappointed.\" \u2014 MS, SACO VIRTUAL GATHERINGS Another way to connect & consult, Rune's Virtual Gatherings offer you the guidance to reclaim your health and empower you to become the best guardian of it - just from afar.

You are seeking clarity & guidance for your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health concerns from a holistic yet integrative perspective.

You are motivated to participate in your healing process by adopting and consistently implementing recommendations offered for your care plan. You are comfortable using virtual platforms for meeting online. Gatherings occur on a weekly basis at first to allow for accumulation of progress and increased accountability. Knowing this, Virtual Gatherings are ideal if you are willing & able to make the time to commit to your healing process. INITIAL CONSULT | 90 mins | $175 Our initial gathering will allow me to understand the story that led to your health concerns in the first place. We will discuss your past & current health history so I can discern the root imbalances leading to your symptoms. You will leave with an initial action step to implement before your next session. RETURNING GATHERINGS | 40 mins | $120 Your first follow-up session is where I will provide you with a summary of your unique energetic constitution in East Asian Medicine as well as an understanding of your patterns & how they are manifesting in your well-being. From there, we will officially embark on your care plan together. By the end of your first session and those to follow, you will cultivate a treasure trove of the resources and rituals to wield at your will as you become more attuned to your body's messages, discerning what it needs for you to not just heal, but thrive. This is what I refer to at Rune as awakened embodiment. May you experience it for yourself, even gathering from afar. ~ Packages are available upon request ~ WHAT PATIENTS ARE SAYING \"Lauren immediately made me feel comfortable and heard. She is a great listener and I really got the sense that she cares about your overall wellbeing. Lauren asked a lot of questions and I felt that she really took the time to get to know me and the whole picture of what was going on. I was really impressed by her attention to detail, as well as her compassionate and friendly demeanor! I have never been to another provider that looked at the \"big picture\" before. It is a refreshing and very much appreciated change!\" \u2014 SM, PORTLAND The Journal Dive into my musings & blog on all things medicine, mysticism, and transformative healing.
