Therapeutic Efficacy of Yoga for Common Primary Care Conditions Hot-Spotting at Dryden Terrace: Dryden Terrace is a low-income housing complex that sits right next to the Northeast Clinic. Historically, there have been large numbers of emergency calls to the building, which prompted a coordinated effort from both the Northeast Family Medicine staff and the Madison Fire Department to help address concerns from the community to lower the number of calls. Over the last several years, staff from the Northeast Clinic would visit Dryden Terrace on a monthly basis to provide support to the community and help to prevent some of these 911 calls. COVID-19 changed this in 2020. Due to our inability to gather, we have been putting together a monthly newsletter on different health topics for the residents at Dryden Terrace. The newsletter has been well received, though we look forward to the time when we can gather in person again. Thank you to all the patients, my co-residents, faculty, and staff who have taught me so much along the way. I would not be where I am today without each and every one of you. Thank you to my family and friends for supporting me in becoming a doctor. You've been with me during the long hours and difficult situations, for which I am incredibly grateful. Further appreciation goes out to my husband, Josh, who has been with me every step of the way to provide love, support, and encouragement. I couldn't have completed this journey without him. Therapeutic Efficacy of Yoga for Common Primary Care Conditions Adrienne Hampton, MD and Megan Bartz , MD Abstract Yoga is a popular form of exercise that uses body postures, meditation and breathing techniques. Yoga has been shown to have many health benefits. Our goal for this review is to orient health professionals to the evidence- based uses of yoga most relevant to primary care. A PubMed search was conducted including meta- analyses, reviews, systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials. Results were limited to English language and publication between 2010 and 2020. Yoga was found to help decrease hypertension, relieve back pain, promote overall wellbeing and improve mental health. Yoga is a relatively safe and effective option for patients interested in therapeutic lifestyle change to promote wellbeing, and to help manage hypertension, back pain and overall mental health. Introduction Yoga is a system of health -promoting attitudes and practices arising out of Hindu philosophy. In the West, the elements of yoga most emphasized and widely practiced are breath control practices, bodily postures, and meditation (1, 2). Increasingly, Americans are practicing yoga for overall wellness, and to treat specific health conditions. A 2017 survey of US adults ages 18+ found that 1 in 7 Americans had practiced yoga in the past 12 months (3). As such, primary care clinicians may encounter questions about yoga, including the health benefits and safety of this practice. To orient healthcare professionals to the evidence -based uses of yoga, we will review current literature on the efficacy of yoga to address commonly -encount ered health -related concerns. A 2018 systematic review of the top reasons for visits in primary care found that (in descending order) hypertension, upper respiratory tract infection, depression/anxiety, back pain, and routine health maintenance are the 5 the top reasons for visits to primary care clinicians in developed countries (4) Our review will focus on these conditions, excluding URI. Search Methods A PubMed search was completed using the key terms 'yoga' and each reported condition, and 'yoga and safety'. The search parameters included meta- analyses, reviews, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials. We limited our inquiry to English language and publication between 2010 and 2020. Search dates: 01 Feb 2020 to 29 May 2020. Two revie wers evaluated articles for inclusion. From this initial search, we prioritized meta- analyses and reviews with adult study populations, though one included study includes incarcerated youth. High quality RCTs were included where meta- analyses and reviews were not available. Patient Case - Linda Linda is a 61 year old woman who comes to see you for a routine health maintenance visit. She has a history of hypertension that she prefers to manage without pharmaceuticals. Additionally, she notes her mother suffered a series of devastating falls, and she'd like a health maintenance activity to support healthy mobility into advanced age. Based on what she's heard of the health benefits of yoga, she asks if yoga might be a good activity to try. Health Maintenance and Wellbeing According to national sur vey data from 2012, 78% of people practicing yoga in the US are practicing for general health and disease prevention (5). Yoga has shown benefit for several indicators of wellbeing in otherwise healthy individuals. Yoga may be an effective intervention for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk reduction. In a 2016 meta -analysis of 32 RCTs with healthy adults and adults with CVD risk factors, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and CAD, asana- based yoga practice was shown to improve cardiovascular risk factors including BMI, systolic blood pressure, LDL and HDL compared to non- exercise controls. Notably, no difference was observed between yoga and other exercise interventions (6). A 2014 Cochrane review evaluating yoga for the prevention of cardiovascular disease reported improvements in diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides with yoga interventions (7).

A large 2019 meta-analysis of the effects of yoga on physical functioning (17 trials) and health related quality of life (20 trials) in older adults demonstrated that yoga practice is associated with improved balance, flexibility, and strength as compared to inactive controls. Compared to active controls, results for strength and flexibility favored yoga interventions. Results for HRQOL also favored the yoga interventions in the domains of depression, perceived mental health, perceived physical health, sleep quality, and vitality as compared to non -active controls(8). In 2018, Tulloch et al published a meta -analysis of 12 RCTs in people 60+ y ears of age (n=752) examining the effects of yoga on health -related quality of life and mental wellbeing. They found a significant medium- sized effect on HRQOL and a small, statistically significant effect on mental well -being (9). In a 2016 meta -analysi s (n=307), results for yoga trended toward improved balance and mobility in persons 60 years or older, though results did not reach statistical significance(10). A 2019 pilot RCT with 81 participants 55+ years of age with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impa irment showed improvements in memory for both the yoga and a memory training intervention, where only the yoga participants showed statistically significant improvements in executive functioning as compared to participants in the memory training group (11). In a 2014 RCT peri and post menopausal women, yoga showed a modest positive effect on menopause- related QOL (12). These results demonstrate that yoga can help older adults improve their physical functioning and quality of life. Table 2.

One study did not report results (13). In a 2015 me ta-analysis examining the effects of yoga on incarcerated women and youth, participants in yoga programs showed improved behavioral functioning (10 trials) and psychological well-being (9 trials), with longer programs tending to show more robust results (1 4). Hypertension According to America's Health Rankings in 2019, 30.8% of Wisconsin adults have been told they have high blood pressure by a health professional (15). The Wisconsin Chronic Disease Quality Improvement Project found that patients with hypertension and with Wisconsin Health Plans and National Commercial Health Plans had controlled blood pressure an average of 68.6% and 62.2% respectively(16). As of 2017, high blood pressure was estimated to account for $68 billion in medical care expenses per year in the US(17). Yoga has been considered as a treatment to improve blood pressure control. There have been 4 systematic reviews and meta- analyses in the last several years looking at patients with high blood pressure and yoga (18,19,20,21) (Table 3). All of the reviews have shown some improvement both SBP and DBP, though they have not always been consistent in the amount of change seen. This is likely due to the low number of studies in this area, high or unclear risk of bias in most of the studie s included and high degree of heterogeneity. The three reviews that looked at yoga vs exercise as a control showed that there was no statistical difference between these interventions (18,19,20). In the 2013 systematic review and meta -analysis by Hagins et al., yoga was found to decrease SBP by -4.17 mmHg (p=0.0002 CI - 3.62 mmHg (p=0.0001, CI (-8.17 mmHg) and DBP (- 6.14 mmHg) when yoga contained all three elements (postures, breathing and meditation) compared to yoga that contained <3 of these elements(18). The systematic review and meta-analysis in 2014 studying yoga and hypertension by Cramer et al . showed a reduction in SBP of - 9.65 mmHg (p=0.01 CI - 17.23, - mmHg (p=0.01 CI - 12.83, -1.62)(19). Another meta- analysis by Cramer et al. looked at patients with cardiovascular risk factors, and found that yoga vs. usual care or no intervention was associated with a decrease in SBP of - 5.85 mmHg (p <0.01, CI - 8.81,- 2.89) and DBP of - 4.12 mmHg (p<0.01, CI -6.55, - 1.69). Furthermore, in non -diabetic patients with high cardiovascular risk factors, they found that SBP was decreased by - 10.00 mmHg (p<0.01 CI - 16.42, - 3.59) in the yoga group vs usual care/no treatment (20). Between groups assigned to yoga and to exercise, no significant differences in blood pressure outcomes were observed (18, 19, 20). In the most recent systematic review and meta- analysis, a meta-regression analysis was done to determine which elements of yoga elicited the greatest blood pressure effects. Reductions of SBP were statistically significantly greater for studies including breathing techniques and higher initial blood pressures. The additive model created for SBP (samples with hypertension, with breathing techniques, with average methodological study quality and controlled for publication bias) showed a decrease in SBP of - 11.3 mmHg (CI -14.6, -8.1) (21). Reductions of DBP were statistically significantly greater for studies including meditation, practicing 4x per week, and higher initial blood pressure. The additive model created for DBP (samples with hypertension, with meditation, with average methodological study quality, with and yoga practiced >3x per week) showed a reduction of DBP by - 5.5 mmHg (CI -7.4, -3.8)(21). Despite the high amount of heterogeneity and high risk of bias in the randomized controlled trials noted in most of the meta -analyses, all have found a statistically significant decrease in blood pressure with yoga. This suggests that there is evidence that yoga can decrease both SBP and DBP in meaningful amounts ranging from 4-11 and 3- 7 mmHg respectively. Table 3. Hypertension Author/year Study design Study populations Outcomes Number of studies or subgroups Sample size Results, (95% confidence interval), P value Controls Hagins 2013 (18) Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis Pre- hypertensive or hypertensive non- exercise Cramer 2014 (19) Systematic Review and Meta- analysis Pre- hypertensive or hypertensive adults Cramer 2014 (20) Systematic Review and Meta- analysis Healthy, non - diabetic adults with risk of cardiovascular disease or adults with diabetes mellitus type 2 Blood Pressure 17 Wu 2019 (21) Systematic Review and Meta- analysis Adults Blood Pressure 49 3517 SBP -0.47 weighted DBP = diastolic blood pressure However, as with most lifestyle modifications, questions remain about the feasibility and the likelihood that patients will implement these changes in their lives. A matched controlled study by Wolff et al. looked at adult patients who were matched by SBP and whether a yoga class vs at home yoga were more effective in lowering blood pressure (22). The yoga at home group was given a CD and a manual by a health professional who was not a qualified yoga instructor. Interestingly, the at home yoga group showed a decrease in DBP by 4.4 mmHg compared to the control (treatment as usual). This is in contrast to no improvement in blood pressure in the yoga class group compared to the control, suggesting that an at home practice could be a feasible lifestyle change (22). Another study by Sarah et al. looked at male patients who were hospitalized in Germany for non -cardiac or pulmonary diagnoses and with SBP>135 and <165 mmHg (23). These patients underwent inpatient yoga practice during rehab prior to discharge. The study was evaluating whether telerehabilitation (including telephone check ins) vs no further support increased the likelihood of continued compliance with yoga practice. It was found that adherence was statistically significantly higher in the telerehabilitation group vs the control group (60.5% vs 29.3% p<0.0001 at 6 months and 56.0% vs 23.9% p=0.014) (23). This suggests that phone check ins can be useful in supporting patient adherence to this lifestyle modification. Overall, yoga has been shown to decrease SBP by 4 to 11 mmHg and DBP by 3 to 7 mmHg and is a feasible option for patients to do at home with some support from primary care providers. Patient Case- Linda continued You discuss the benefits of yoga with Linda. At a follow up 4 months later, she states that she has been practicing yoga about 3 times a week and finding joy in this practice. Her blood pressure is under control and she thanks you for your recommendation. Patient Case- Mark Mark is a 50 year old male with a history of depression who presents to your office to discuss low back pain. He has had low back pain for years. He has tried many different treatment modalities including NSAIDs, Tylenol, lidocaine patches, icy -hot, and PT. He is wondering if there is anything else that can be done to help with his pain? He also has a nephew with opioid use disorder and would like to avoid any more medications. His wife has been doing yoga and he's wondering if this would help with his back? DBP weighted mean effect size -0.47 (-0.61 to -0.32, -3.9 mmHg) P<0.001 Back Pain Back pain is estimated to generate $100 billion in healthcare costs annually (24), and back pain consistently ranks among the top 3 diagnoses in claims prevalence and cost for Quartz Health Solutions, a major Wisconsin health insurance company (25). Yoga has been extensively studied for chronic low back pain and function (26, 27, 28) (Table 4). A 2019 meta -analysis of 13 RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of yoga for low back pain demonstrated that yoga practice significantly decreased pain intensity ( SMD = 0.33, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.19, p < 0.001) (26). In a 2013 meta -analysis of yoga for low back pain and pain- related function, yoga was shown to improve pain based on what the reviewers deemed moderate quality evidence from 6 high quality RCTs. Short term improvements in back -related disability were also observed (27). In a 2017 Cochrane Review, 9 trials compared yoga to non -exercise controls. Yoga was associated with improved function at short and long- term follow -up, with moderate and small effect sizes respectively. Yoga was associated with improved pain at short, intermediate, and long -term follow - up as well; results were statistically significant but did not meet the authors' threshold for clinical significance (28). The same Cochrane review compared yoga to exercise controls (4 trials), and the authors found no difference between yoga and non- yoga exercise for back -related function. For pain, yoga participants demonstrated statistically and clinically significant improvement at intermediate -term fol low up (1 trial), but not short- term follow -up. No long- term follow -up results were reported for this comparison (28). Table 4.

In a 2017 review of 14 RCTs, functioning was significantly better in the yoga group as compared to education intervention controls at short- term (5 trials) and long -term (4 trials) follow-up. When compared to exercise, yoga tended to be associated with small improvements in pain and functioning, though results were not always statistically significant (29). In a 2020 systematic review published by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, when compared to attention or wait -list controls, yoga showed improved function at short (8 trials) and intermediate (3 trials) term follow -up. Additionally when compared with atte ntion or wait- list controls, yoga was associated with improved pain at short (7 trials) and intermediate (2 trials) term follow- up. There were no differences between yoga and other exercise for pain or function at short or intermediate -term follow -up(30). A 2017 review on the cost -effectiveness of various nonpharmacologic therapies for low back pain suggests that yoga is a cost -effective therapy for chronic low back pain. However, these results must be interpreted with caution in the United States as the studies reviewed were carried out in Europe (31). Overall, there is a growing body of literature demonstrating that yoga is a moderately effective means of treating chronic low back pain. Patient case - Mark continued Mark also notes that his mood isn't as good as it used to be despite continuing to take his SSRI regularly. His wife has been saying that yoga has been helping her mood. He's wondering if there is any truth behind this. Mental Health Anxiety and depression are, together, the third leading chief complaint for primary care visits in developed countries (4) and in 2018 7.2% of adults had an episode of major depressive disorder in the last year (32). In a national survey on yoga use, 84.7% of people stated that practicing yoga reduced their stress levels and 67.5% of people stated that practicing yoga made them feel better emotionally (5). One proposed mechanism of the feeling of decreased stress levels is that practicing yoga has been found to increase GABA levels in the thalamus (33). While most of the randomized control trials studying yoga and depression/anxiety have high risk of bias and heterogeneity, there is some evidence that yoga can be effective in treating these conditions (34, 35, 36, 37, 38). A systematic review and meta-analysis looking at yoga and depression found that there was moderate evidence for short term effects of improving severity of depression with yoga vs usual care (SMD= -0.69 CI - 0.99, - 0.39 P<0.001) (34) (Table 5 ). There was also limited evidence for improvement of depression for yoga vs relaxation and yoga vs aerobic exercise, though smaller than yoga vs usual care (34). Another systematic review for patients with major depressive disorder found that there was no difference between yoga and exercise or antidepressant medication (imipramine) for treatment of depression (35). This particular systematic review was flawed in that it analyzed very few studies which had few participants. However, given that exercise and antidepressant medications are known to improve depression, it is reasonable to suggest that yoga can also improve depression in those with major depressive disorder. Table 5.

Even greater effects were found for yoga compared to active controls like progressive muscle relaxation (SMD - 0.86 CI - 1.56, -0.15, P=0.02) (36). In a more recent RCT looking at yoga vs no treatment for anxiety in college students, there was a statistically significant improvement of anxiety symptom scores in those in the yoga group (37). Table 6. Anxiety SMD = standardized mean difference While there is at least modest evidence for improvement in the short term for both anxiety and depression with yoga, very few studies have looked at long term benefits. One such study followed patients with cancer for 6 months after the end of a yoga intervention to see if there were decreases in depression and anxiety scores (38). Overall, both sym ptoms of anxiety and depression were statistically significantly improved compared to their baseline scores prior to the yoga intervention. In addition, 69% of patients in the study were still practicing yoga at 6 month follow up, likely due to reported subjective benefits (38). Overall, there is moderate evidence that yoga could be an additional tool to treat anxiety and depression. Patient case - Mark continued Mark's daughter attends classes at a 'power yoga' studio, and their website depicts highly flexible young adults in challenging positions, including headstand. Mark asks if you advise this type of yoga for him? Safety In clinical trials, yoga has generally been shown to be a safe activity. Only about 2.2% of participants experience yoga- relate d adverse events, and only 0.6% of participants experience serious adverse events (39). These numbers are comparable to usual care or other exercise interventions (40). The most common adverse event reported with respect to yoga practice for back pain is temporarily increased pain (41, 30). Serious adverse events include stroke and glaucoma. These complications are rare (42). The wide variety of yoga interventions studied and variations in reporting generally preclude assessment of risk by specific type of yoga (39). However, certain postures have demonstrated increased risk of adverse events. The yoga practices most frequently associated with serious adverse Author/year Study design Study populations Outcomes Number of studies or subgroups Sample size Results, (95% confidence interval), P value Controls Cramer 2018 (36) Systematic Review and Meta- analysis Adults with diagnosis of an anxiety disorder Improvement of anxiety based on various scales 3 169 SMD = -0.43 ( -0.74, -0.15) P=0.02Active Controls events are headstand, shoulder stand, lotus position (where the practitioner is seated and the legs are crossed such that both feet rest on the opposite thighs), postures requiring the placement of one or both feet behind the head, and intense, forceful breathing practices (42). These practices are generally not recommended for a medical population, and may only be considered on a case by case basis for advanced yoga practitioners under the guidance of a certified yoga instructor. Overall, yoga is regarded as being as safe as other exercise or usual care, and can be safely practiced by most people under the direction of a certified instructor. Patient case - Mark continued Mark returns to your clinic 3 months later and states that he has been practicing yoga with his wife 3 -4 times per week. He has not gone to the power yoga class with his daughter. He states that his mood has overall improved since starting yoga. While he still has some back pain, he also feels that yoga has improved both his mobility and pain. Conclusion To date, yoga shows promise as a relatively safe and effective option for patients interested in therapeutic lifestyle change to promote wellbeing, and to help manage hypertension, back pain and overall mental health. However, our review is limited by numb er of studies, small sample sizes, poor quality data and risk of bias. Additionally, there are many different types of yoga and different elements of yoga practice such as meditation, breathing and postures. Preliminary data suggest that a mix of these elements in the treatment of hypertension could be more beneficial than only practicing one or two of these elements of yoga. These results indicate that more studies are needed to determine the optimal components of a yoga intervention for a given health condition, dosing of the intervention, and method of delivery. Additionally, more studies are needed to discern the safety and efficacy profiles of different styles of yoga, which vary widely in emphasis on the different components of yoga and level of ex ertion. Still, the current data in aggregate are encouraging, and we hope clinicians will feel more comfortable considering yoga as a therapeutic option for the top conditions seen in primary care. Table 7.

Although she is especially interested in rural, addiction, and integrative medicine, Taylor is also active in advocacy and community engagement. Taylor is from rural Stoddard, WI (near La Crosse). She received her undergraduate degree in Biological Sciences and Spanish from the University of Notre Dame. Taylor returned to Wisconsin to earn her medical degree from the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. Taylor is an advocate, having been involved with multiple professional societies on local, state, and national levels. She has written resolutions and advocated for a variety of policies including infant mortality, opioid use, and alcohol abuse. She has offered testimony during bill hearings and met with legislators on several occasions to discuss upcoming bills and how they impact the healthcare system. While in medical school, Taylor created \"Every Patient Has a Story\" which is a narrative medicine project that interviews hospital patients about their life stories in order to provide more holistic care and better understand their medical needs. Taylor also traveled to China to learn about their healthcare system and how to incorporate integrative medicine techniques to supplement Western medicine. Taylor enjoys running, hunting, and cheering on Wisconsin sports; nowadays you can most often find her spending time with her husband and 7 month old daughter. The Lion Project: Advocating for Addiction Treatment in the Jail System Innovative Partnerships to Support the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder in a Rural Teaching Clinic: Rural areas face particular challenges in treating opioid use disorder due to the lack of prescribers offering medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), scarce behavioral health resources, and lack of specialty support. The Rural Health Equity Track (RHET) emphasizes leadership and advocacy skills that help address these challenges. Our clinic collaborates with the Green County Human Services Department, who offers counseling for relapse prevention and refers patients to our clinic for MOUD. At the international WONCA meeting in New Mexico in October 2019, we presented our framework for starting and sustaining a MOUD program, hopefully inspiring primary care clinicians to offer MOUD, particularly in rural residency training tracks. I would like to thank my wonderful husband, Michael, and my family for supporting me throughout my residency. I could not have made it through all of the nights and long hours without them. It is my family who has shaped the person I am today and inspired my passions for rural medicine. I am also extremely appreciative of everyone at Belleville Clinic who have helped me to become a compassionate, hopefully competent physician. Lastly, even though she made her appearance late in residency, I am so grateful for my daughter Eliana, who reminds me every day of what is important. The Lion Project: Advocating for Addictio n Treatment in the Jail System Taylor Boland Rigby , MD Background This learning experience addresses access to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) for patients w hile they are in the jail sy stem. S ince initiating MOUD at t he UW Be lleville c linic, i t has been not ed that pa tients who are jailed of ten ha ve their M OUD s topped, particularly subox one. This significantly increases our patients' r isk of overdose and death; it is well known that those released f rom jail ar e 13 times mor e likely to die of drug ov erdose w ithin t he first 2 w eeks af ter release. I n speaking with phy sicians across the state, it appears it is commonplace that subox one and methadone are not of fered w ithin c orrectional f acilities. S o, it was my goal with this pr oject t o identify barriers t o treating M OUD within t he jail sy stem and advocate for full ac cess of all MOUD (naltrexone, methadone, and bupr enorphine) within j ails. Gi ven my i nterest in organized me dicine, I chose to make formal adv ocacy an important part of my project in hope s of achieving formal, lasting legislative c hange in this ar ea. C ommunity partners i ncluded Gr een C ounty Hum an Services Department, V ernon County Sherriff's Of fice, L a Crosse County Sherriff's D epartment, Dane County jail system, the Wisconsin Medical Society, the Wisconsin Opioid Task F orce, the Wisconsin Department of Health S ervices, and American A cademy of Family Physicians. Objectives As not ed ab ove, I w as attempting to increase ac cess t o all MOUD, pa rticularly subox one, w ithin t he jail sy stems i n Wi sconsin. It was my goal to achieve this through l egislative advocacy and also through local partnerships within jail systems in Wisconsin. Methods I initially researched the breadth of this problem and how other states had addressed this concern and achieved br oader ac cess t o MOUD. Hi storically, t his ha s happened l ocally w ith improved partnerships between phy sicians and t he jail system. S o, several me mbers o f our clinic met with Green County officials to discuss barriers to offering buprenorphine within the jail system. Several were identified, including discomfort in prescribing opioids among the jail physicians a s well as officers t aking c are of the patients. Re cognizing these b arriers, I attempted to work w ith the Wisconsin DHS and several j ails w ithin Wi sconsin t o educate officials abo ut the safety and e fficacy of buprenorphi ne. Unfortunately the COVID- 19 pandemic stalled t hese e fforts. On t he state level, I worked wit h the WMS and Opioid Task F orce to testify on l egislation that would e xpand MOUD access w ithin al l jail and prison systems w ithin t he state. L astly, I r eached ou t to my own patients on MOUD about their e xperiences w ith limited access t o MOUD within t he jail sy stem. I c ollected their stories with the intention of providing patient- centered i nsight when e ducating state officials. Results After t estifying in the Assembly Com mittee on Substance Abuse and Prevention in support of Assembly Bi ll 645 in J anuary 2020, the bill passed. This bi ll requires t he DHS to w ork with t he Department of Corrections to study MOUD within t he jail sy stem and develop a pilot project to offer all forms of MOUD, including buprenorphine, within at least one county jail or prison. Again, due to the COVID- 19 pandemic, the start date for this study and pilot has been delayed. I wrote several resolutions exploring the ability for primary care physi cians to offer methadone as MOUD for our patients. Despite this being a complicated, nuanced issue, I do think it is important for physicians to be able to provide all forms of MOUD to their patients if appropriate . As a result, the resident group of the A AFP now supports the use of methadone within the primary care setting for trained individuals. Currently, the AMA is researching this issue. After our clinic's meeting with Green County jail staff, I put together a handout of information and guidance on MO UD use within the Green County jail and the best ways to continue buprenorphine use for our patients. This information is available to clinic staff and physicians who may be struggling to advocate for buprenorphine use for their patient within the Green County jail. As mentioned above, due to the current pandemic I am still in the process of forming connections with jail systems and bridging disconnect s between patients and jail leadership. I am compiling a handout of facts about MOUD as well as patient pers pectives regarding MOUD within the jail system. I plan to utilize this handout when I connect with the sheriff's offices of Green, Dane, Vernon, and La Crosse counties. I am fortunate to be staying an additional year as an Academic Fellow and will continue to prioritize this work as part of my academic projects. Conclusions My current handout about MOUD use within the Green County jail is available everyone at the Belleville Clinic and will hopefully help to give guidance when patients are told they will be taken off of MOUD when jailed. I plan to distribute my comprehensive handout of MOUD and patient perspectives to all interested within our clinic and residency program. I learned a lot through this project, most importantly how difficult it is to effect c hange in a large system. Fortunately I was able to contribute to a bill being passed that would help achieve my primary goal of expanded MOUD access within the jails. However, I know that this will take several years to take effect when our patients need h elp now. There are several systemic barriers to compassionate addiction care within our jails, but I have learned that direct partnerships with local agencies can help significantly to break down those barriers with education and patient perspectives . As t his project continues, I would recommend spending more time directly working with the Green County Human Services Department. I think this would create more tangible change within the course of a resident CHLE, while broader advocacy efforts will take much longer to achieve the goals listed above. Future steps for this project include continuing to reach out and communicate with jail systems and putting together data from WI county jail systems about barriers to prescribing MOUD. This information is vital as I put together a handout that can educate the Wisconsin DHS and statewide jail systems. Dr. Landeck is part of a group that obtained a grant from the Wisconsin DHS to pilot telehealth services within jail systems. One of this group's goals is to offer addiction treatment and perhaps even begin MOUD prior to leaving the jail. This is in line with my CHLE goals, and I look forward to working with Dr. Landeck's group during my fellowship year to advance this project. Acknowledgments I would like to wholeheartedly thank Jillian Landeck for being my mentor not only with this CHLE, but also for MOUD in general. It is a strong interest of mine that has only grown through residency. I also want to extend a big thank you to Green County Human Services Department for their work on MOUD within the jail system and their assistance with this learning experience. Lastly, I would like to thank my husband for initially getting me involved in advocacy and helping me to find my voice within the large, scary system that is organized medicine. I have met amazing advocates along the way, and because of these people I am hopeful for the future of medicine. TO: Assembly Committee on Substance Abuse and Prevention F ROM: Taylor Boland Rigby , MD DAT E: January 8, 2020 RE: S upport for HOPE Legislation AB 645 - Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) for Prisons and Jails AB 646 - Recovery Residences and State Employee MAT AB 647 - Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Extension AB 650 - Peer Recovery Coaches AB 651 - Good Samaritan Extension G ood a fternoon Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the Substance Abuse and Prevention Committee. My name is Dr. Taylor Boland Rigby. I earned my medical degree here at the University of Wisconsin and am currently a second year resident at UW in Family Medicine. I work in several of the hospitals here in Madison as well as in the rural community of Belleville, WI . I am here today to testify in support of the most recent round of the Heroin, Opioid Prevention and Education (HOPE) bills. Wi sconsin has been a leader in tackling the opioid crisis that has afflicted so many in our community. At national conferences, I have been proud to say that I am from Wisconsin while discussing what further measures can be taken to combat this epidemic. As the state's largest physician organization, the Wisconsin Medical Society has been a vital partner with the Legislature to create solutions to the opioid crisis and to help those who are struggling with addiction. Physicians throughout Wisconsin, like many of yourselves, have witnessed first -hand the impacts that addiction has on our patients, families and communities. The Society has worked tirelessly to promote opioid education throughout the state with the goal of improving both physician practice and patient outcomes. However, much work remains to be done. Thi s most recent round of HOPE legislation focuses on increasing access to treatment for those suffering from opioid addiction. Specifically, we are supportive of both AB 645 and AB 646 which would increase the use of medication assisted treatment , also known as MAT , for prison populations. They also create nee ded employee protections for those under a prescribed MAT program. MAT is the use of one of three medicines (methadone, naltrexone, or buprenorphine) to decrease craving s and withdrawal in a monitored medical setting with the goal of achieving sobriety . Evidence proves that MAT is an effective way to manage opioid addiction, allowing patients to live productive and meaningful lives. Increasing access to MAT, particularly for at -risk populations, will help those who would likely suffer from withdrawal and/or relapse and act as a foundation for continued sobriety. Evidence shows persons recently incarcerated are anywhere from 40 -120 times more likely to overdose and die. Programs that have offered MAT in jails have led to 60- 85% decreases in overdose death. MAT is life -saving and , as one of my patients said last week , \"the best decision I have made in my entire life.\" With patients that are on a particular MAT medicine , it is important that they remain stable by continuing their specific form of MAT. Several of my patients on MAT have fled rather than go to jail due to fear that their buprenorphine would not be continued. Thus, piloting the use of all forms of MAT in the jail system is a crucial step towards successful treatment of opioid addiction. While some people have concerns that MAT medicines can be diverted in the jail, there are several ways to mitigate this risk including monitored administration and using the dissolvable form of buprenorphine . We are also supportive of the use of recovery residences under AB 646 as a means to help those who suffer from opioid use disorder integrate back into their communities. The Society is also supportive of AB 650 and the use of peer recovery coaches as another evidence - based treatment for opioid use disorder. The 2018 report stated that peer recovery coaches and recovery specialists are a viable option to help coordinate care for patients upon their discharge for an overdose. 1 Another study showed that the use of a peer recovery coach along with naloxone in the emergency department is an acceptable treatment and one that can be maintained over time.2 The recent addition of a peer recovery coach in Green County has been an overall positive experience for our patients; th is coach is available for therapy sessions, informal conversations, and even rides to appointments . Lastly, the Society supports the extension of the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program requirement (AB 647) and the repeal of the sunset date for the \"Good Samaritan\" Law (AB 651). Opioid prescriptions have steadily decreased by 35 percent since 2015. 3 This decrease suggests that the requirement to check the PDMP has helped to reduce opioid prescribing. It is the hope of the Society that checking the PDMP becomes a best practice for Wisconsin physicians and that ultimately this requirement would no longer be needed. However, we support the extension pending future conversations and data. Repealing the sunset on the Good Samaritan Law is a commonsense update to a necessary law that helps people get access to care at the most critical moments. I thank the Committee for giving me the opportunity to testify in support of this important legislation. https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/08/31/legislative-report- chapter -55-aug-2017.pdf Ranapurwala SI, Shanahan ME, Alexandridis AA, et al.

Jon strives to build strong relationships with each of his patients so he can better understand their medical, social, and family situations to provide the best care. Jon has a special interest in sports medicine, but he is always looking forward to work with all patients and conditions. He enjoys spending time with family and friends and playing golf and basketball. Wingra Resource Navigator Program Custom vs. Prefabricated Orthotics for Treatment of Plantar Fasciitis: A summary of evidence for custom and prefabricated orthotics was reviewed, synthesized and submitted to FPIN for evaluation. The review of evidence revealed the lack of evidence supporting custom orthoses for the treatment of plantar fasciitis, especially with regards to cost benefit. The literature review also revealed a need for further research comparing foot orthoses to other conservative cares such as ice, stretching, and anti-inflammatory medication. Thank you to: - My Parents for always being available for encouragement and support. - My co-residents, I couldn't imagine going through residency with a better crew. - DFMCH faculty for the unrelenting encouragement, support, and guidance. - DFMCH administrative staff for putting up with my never ending scheduling requests and untimely email responses.Wingra Resource Navigator Program Jonathan Christ, MD & Carly Salter, MD Background The Wingra Resource Navigator P rogram is aimed to identify Wingra patients who are in need of essentials that play a role in their health such as food, housing, transportation, etc. The patient populations we serve at Wingra Clinic are often disadvantaged financially and use our clinic as their main community resource. With the assistance of prior project contributors familiar with the Resource Navigator program at our clinic, undergraduate student navigator volunteers were trained to assist the social work team in connecting our patients with the community resource they needed. Objectives Our goal was to further integrate the resource navigators into the workflow at Wingra Clinic since there was little communication between providers and the navigators. We sought to integrate the navigators into clinic huddles and provide them with the list of patients being seen in the clinic the following day so that they could be aware of when their patients were being seen in clinic. This would enable them to reach out to providers in order to work together on addressing the patients' needs since they do not have access to our electronic medical record. We also strove to increase awareness about the Resource Navigator program among providers in clinic. Methods We held meetings with clinic leadership and resource navigator leaders to identify disconnects between providers and student navigators. During a resident education afternoon at Wingra in Fall 2019, we presented the background information about the resource navigators to the providers in clinic and encouraged providers to reach out about patients with concerns about resources. Screening forms were created during the COVID- 19 pandemic and handed to patients at check in and were to be returned and collected by Sheray Wallace to identify individuals in need. Results The daily patient schedule was printed out by the reception staff on the day prior and given to the resource navigators so that they could identify when their patients would be seen and would reach out to providers prior to the visits. This was implemented and a few weeks later, the COVID- 19 shutdown was implemented and navigators were removed from clinic. The resident education afternoon increased awareness of the Resource Navigator Program and its potential role in the care of our patients. The screening f orms were infrequently filled out because patients were simply handed the forms without an explanation of what they were for and just threw them away or took them home with them. Conclusion s The impact of our efforts to connect clinic providers and student navigators was complicated by the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic as the student navigators that were an integral component to our improvement plan were no longer present in the clinic as a p recaution. Prior to the pandemic, our efforts at resident education afternoons increased clinic utilization of the student navigators as a resource to identify and connect patients to their needed resources. The implemented screening forms created during the pandemic helped Sheray Wallace and the student navigator team stay connected with in need patients despite their absence at Wingra Clinic.

Do C arotid Artery C alcifications Seen on R adiographs Predict C arotid A rtery S tenosis in Asymptomatic A dults? Diana Cowdrey, MD CI Question Do carotid artery calcifications seen on radiographs predict carotid artery stenosis in asymptomatic adults ? Evidence -Based Answer In asymptomatic patients, carotid artery calcifaction seen on radiograph has a positive predictive value of 70% and a negative predicti ve value of 75% for carotid artery stenosis. (strength of recommendation [SOR]: B, systematic review with observational studies with heterogeneous results and retrospective cohort study ). Carotid calcifications on radiographs may be more predictive of carotid stenosis in people with atherosclerotic risk factors (SOR: C, cross sectional study ). Evidence Summary A meta- analysis (12 observational studies, n=1002) compared the diagnostic accuracy of panoramic radiography (PR) to Doppler ultrasonography (11 studies) or angiography (1 study) in detecting calcified carotid artery atheroma (CCAA) (1). The studies conducted in eight countries were published after 2006. Patients were 29-71 years old without history of stoke, endarterectomy, angioplasty or renal disease. The pooled analysis sensitivity of PR to detect CCAA was 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69 - 77% ), ranging from 31 - 95% , and pooled analysis specificity was 72% (95% CI, 25 - 63% ), ranging from 19 - 99% . The pooled positive predictive value was 70% (95% CI, 66-74%), ranging from 37- 95%, and negative value was 75% (95% CI, 71-79%), ranging from 43% - 93%. Pooled positive likelihood ratio was 2.32 (95% CI, 1.49 - 3. 60) and negative likelihood ratio was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.25 - 0.63). Seven studies had high risk of patient selection bias, and most had methodological limitations. A retrospective cohort study (n=778) from the United States identified carotid artery calcifications on routine dental radiographs in patients > 55 years old and prospectively performed duplex ultrasound (DUS) to assess for significant carotid stenosis ( >50%) (2). artery calcifications on radiographs, and 20 of those patients underwent DUS of bilateral carotid arteries (40 sides). Of twenty -six sides with calcifications on radiograph, 13 (50%) had stenosis confirmed with DUS. Of the 14 sides without calcification o n radiograph, three (21%) had stenosis on DUS. The positive predictive value for calcification on panoramic radiograph predicting significant carotid stenosis was between 40 -80%. A cross sectional study from Sweden looking for surgical canditates for asymptomatic carotid endarterecromy performed panoramic radiographs of 1182 patient s (3). Calcifications were found in 178 people, and 117 of those were eligible for asymotmatic carotid endarterecromy (age 18-74, no cancer or other serious comorbidity, and no prior stroke or TIA) and underwent ultrasound to assess for significant carotid stenosis > 50%. Of the 117 participants who underwent ultrasound, eight participants (6.8%; 95% CI, 2.2-11.5%) , all men , were found to have significant carotid stenosis. Compared to a sex- and age-matched reference group (n=119) with no calcifications on PR, the prevalence of carotid stenosis was significantly higher in men (12.5%; 95% CI, 4.2-20.8%) and patients currently smoking (19%; 0.7-37.4%), taking cholesterol medications (13.1%; 95% CI and with cardiovascular event history (15.9%; 95% CI, 7-27.2%). Recommendations from Others The United States Preventive Services Task Force , Choosing Wisely initiative, and American Academy of Family Physicians do not mention carotid screening with radiographs but recommend against screening for carotid artery stenosis in asymptomatic adults because risks of screening outweigh potential benefits (5,6).

Bob earned his medical degree from the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Rockford. While in Rockford, Bob analyzed Rockford's social and economic factors of health and identified root causes of poor health and provided recommendations to community leaders and agencies. Among his many interests in providing full-spectrum family medicine, Bob seeks to provide exceptional primary healthcare, inspire lifestyle modification, better utilize healthcare information technology, and advocate for primary care at all levels. Outside of work, Bob can be found downhill skiing, water-skiing, playing piano, running, biking, and mixing fresh cocktails with friends and family.Adapting an In-Clinic Community Resource Navigator Program to a Virtual Referral Model Reducing Coding and CDI Queries with Advanced Clinical Documentation Tools: Appropriate clinical documentation is necessary for quality, communication, reimbursement, research, and legal purposes. When documentation is unclear or deficient, clinicians often receive coding and clinical documentation improvement (CDI) queries requesting diagnostic clarification or additional management details. Queries are a source of administrative burden among clinicians and coding specialists. Improved documentation at large healthcare centers can result in millions of dollars of increased charges. We aimed to decrease the frequency of clinical documentation queries on an inpatient family medicine service. Within standardized H&P and progress notes, we implemented clinical documentation tools including disappearing help text, collapsible sections, \"carry-forward\" components, auto-populated consult assessments, and specialty- tailored CDI tip cards. Data indicate a significant reduction in the CDI query rate from 43% to 26%. Secondary outcomes included improved comorbid condition capture, reduced documentation length and time, and better compliance. We propose ways for other institutions to replicate these results and discuss strategies to navigate implementation challenges. Adapting an In- Clinic Community R esource Navigator P rogram to a Virtual R eferral M odel Robert Freidel, MD Background As healthcare delivery shifted toward telehealth in spring 2020 due to the COVID- 19 pandemic, patient needs for remote social assistance at UW Health Northeast Family Medical Center increased. Northeast Clinic is an academic family medical center in a soci oeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood of Madison, Wisconsin, serving approximately 1 0,000 patients. We work with the Community Resource Navigator Program (CRNP), a group led by social workers and undergraduate student \"Navigators\" who have extensive kno wledge of local social, financial, and legal resources. Prior to the COVID- 19 pandemic, Navigators worked on -site and our clinicians referred patients to an in -person intake or provide d a personal introduction to the Navigators for patients who screened positive for socioeconomic needs by a paper screening survey. In response to new infection control guidelines in spring 2020, Navigators transitioned to working remotely and connecting with clinicians and patients by phone. Given the program's previous reli ance on in -person contact (completing a handwritten screening survey and commonly performing an initial intake with Navigators face -to-face), preceding residents and medical students created a series of interviews with clinicians and staff to identify barr iers and opportunities to screening and referring patients to the CRNP . Objectives Our objectives were to respond to feedback from the interviews, develop multiple opportunities for patients to be screened and connected to the CRNP , and evaluate our clinician s' perspectives of the new workflows. My specific roles were to develop and communicate new and approved telemedicine referral workflows and to conduct a follow -up assessment of the new screening and referral processes. Methods Working with our c ommunity partners and clinicians, we designed a multifaceted screening and referral process. We established a \"universal screening\" protocol, providing all patients at office visits with a small handout about the CRNP and how to contact a Navigator. We dev eloped an approved list of referral options for clinicians to utilize whether their patient was in -person or virtual. The updated list was communicated via email, clinic education sessions, and an electronic health record smartphrase accessible to all Nort heast clinicians. Following a two -month trial period, providers (faculty, residents, and advanced practice providers) were surveyed regarding their referral methods and preferences and were asked to provide feedback on the CRNP and its associated workflows. Questions included: Please estimate, on average, how often you suggested a patient connect with the CRNP over the last two months. When you identify a patient who may benefit from CRNP's services during an in -person visit, how do you connect the patient to the CRNP? When you identify a patient who may benefit from CRNP's services during a telehealth visit, how do you connect the patient to the CRNP? Please describe the challenges, if any, you experienced when connecting patients to the CRNP over the pas t two months. What suggestions, questions, comments, or ideas do you have about the CRNP and its related referral workflows? Results There were 26 surveys administered and we received 20 completed surveys. Re sults suggested that most clinicians contact the Navigators on the patients' behalf. In other cases, clinicians provide the CRNP contact information to patients who then contact the Navigators on their own. Top feedback trends included a desire for bidirectional communication with the CRNP to ensure patient follow-up, a lack of time to address resource issues during standard office visits, insufficient education regarding CRNP's services and referral workflows, and recommendations for new or enhanced referral processes. These results were shared with the clinic and CRNP stakeholders. Conclusions Despite an increase in telehealth and a shift to new workflows that limit physical interactions in clinics, it has remained a priority in primary care to connect patients with available resources to address their unmet social needs. This can be achieved by integrating off- site community partners into clinic workflows. Clinics can continue to connect patients with Navigators or similar programs by providing team members and patients with multiple pathways for screening and referrals, creating a flexible and telehealth compatible system. These strategies can be used to create and reinforce meaningful community -clinic partnerships that can help patients overcome structural and systemic barriers to health. We intend to continue working with the CRNP to improve patient accessibility to resources and optimize provider referral processes to the CRNP. Next steps include discussing these results with the Patient/Family Advisory Committee and applying an equity lens to future projects.

I presented this initial work along with a vision for a universal \"adapted standards of care\" handbook that could be used by any provider to practice safe and effective street medicine. With the help of the International Street Medicine Institute and many practitioners around the world there now exists an international handbook of compiled guidelines that is free and available to any practitioner or program who desires to provide care to unsheltered populations. Thank you to my parents and extended family for their endless support. Thank you to my friends and co-residents for the great memories along the way.Madison Area Cares for the Homeless (MACH): Madison Street Medicine Initiative (MSMI) James Ircink, MD Background MACH is a volunteer -based organization in Madison, WI comprised of healthcare professionals and community members with the mission to bridge gaps in the healthcare system by connecting with people experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity with compassion and respect in order to promote access to care and social services. It was started in response to ongoing homelessness in Madison and specifically unsheltered individuals living on State Street who faced barriers to accessing medical care as identified in a needs assessment. MACH community partners include UW Health, UWSMPH, The Beacon, Porchlight, Homeless Services Consortium, Int ernational Street Medicine Institute, Friends of the State Street Family, and others. Objectives 1. Increase understanding of the health needs of individuals experiencing homelessness. 2. Improve understanding of barriers to accessing care within our local healthcare system. 3. Continue building street medicine skill set through outreach, relationships, and practice. 4. Participate in MSMI administrative meetings to become more involved with the organization as a whole. 5. Continue to read text s and contribute to international adapted standards of care guidelines. Methods Volunteered as a street medicine physician once monthly. Reviewed \"Care of Vulnerable and Unsheltered Populations\" textbook. Authored two adapted clinical guidelines that are now published and available for the international street medicine community of practitioners. Participated in development of our narcan distribution program and care connections program. Results Direct medical care was delivered to individuals experiencing homelessness (weekly by the group -- my involvement was monthly). Connections were made to community resources and housing support. Over 100 narcan vials have been distributed. We are currently working with the UW Emergency Department and in the future community paramedics to streamline connecting individuals with primary care providers for long term care. We hope that our relationships with individuals experiencing homelessness helps build trust and convey that, as medical providers, we care and that they matter. Conclusions Street medicine is a safe, effective, inclusive, and compassionate method of care delivery that eliminates barriers to access, builds relationships and trust, and expands continuity of care to the most vulnerable individuals in our community. In order to succeed we need to continue to build our care connections with local healthcare institutions and community partners, continue to build our volunteer base, and increase the frequency of when our teams provide direct services.

Scholarly Project & Community Health Learning Experience: Adapting an In-Clinic Community Resource Navigator Program to a Virtual Referral Model: Social determinants of health, such as socioeconomic status and social support, are fundamental in successful management of chronic diseases. As healthcare delivery shifted toward telehealth in spring 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, patient needs for remote social assistance increased. The UW Health Northeast Family Medical Center developed a new multifaceted social screening and referral process for in-person and telehealth visits to ensure social determinants of health could be addressed in both clinical formats. This was achieved with assistance from academic fellow KJ Hansmann, MD, Julia Alberth, medical student, Bob Freidel, MD, and our existing partner, the Community Resource Navigator Program (CRNP).Projects Completed During Residency: Allison Jenness is drawn to family medicine by the strong patient - physician relationships that form and enhance patient care.

Allison Jenness, MDAdapting an In- Clinic Community Resource Navigator P rogram to a Virtual R eferral M odel Allison Jenness, MD Background The Northeast Family Medical Center works with the Community Resource Navigator Program. The goal of the program is to identify patients at Northeast with unmet social needs and connect them with support and resources within our community. The Community Resource Navigator Program is composed of ' navigators' (social workers and undergraduate students) who have extensive knowledge of local so cial, financial, and legal resources. Previously the navigators were on site at Northeast . Pre-pandemic, r eferrals were made with a paper screening form and then providers typically introduced the patient to the navigators in person. At the start of the pandemic, the navigators moved off -site and into a virtual format. Unfortunately , this caused a reduction in patients being screened and referred to the navigators . The cause of this was likely due to reduced screening, fewer patients being seen in person, and the navigators being off site. Objectives At Northeast it is important to us to help address the social needs of our patients. We want to ensure that patients are being adequately screened and connected to the resources they nee d, even if patients or the navigators are not physically in clinic. There were three parts to this quality improvement project. The first goal was to identify barriers to screening and referral in a more virtual clinical setting. Second, create a new screening and referral process based on provider and staff feedback. Lastly, assess how the new referral process was functioning for providers and what could be improved upon. The first part of the project was conducted by KJ Hansmann, MD, Julia Alberth, medical student, and myself . Bob Freidel , MD, joined the team for the second and third components. Methods Our first step involved speaking with the resource navigator team to get their perspective on how the pandemic had impacted their practice. With the transition to being off site and virtual they had received few new referrals from providers at Northeast. However, the navigators were still quite active with patients they had worked with in the past. KJ was able to connect with Julia through a summer re search program. Together they developed a formalized interview to be conducted with providers . I assisted with editing the questions, doing a practice interview , and recruiting providers and clinic staff to participate. The formalized interview asked if staff and providers were screening patients , if they were screening patients how was this being conducted, how were they connecting patients to the navigators, and what barriers there were. Following those quality improvement interviews; the Northeast team and the navigators created a universal screening form . The form was to be given to all patients and developed multiple workflows to connect patients to the navigators. The options for connecting patients to the navigators included providers consenting patients to allow them to contact the navigators on the patient's behalf or a dot phrase with the navigators contact information for patients to reach them directly. This was implemented at the end of December 2020 and the process was re -evaluat ed 2 months later. After the 2 month trial period, we created a survey for providers to assess how they have been using the new work flows. They were asked questions about how often they were referring patients, what methods they used to refer patients, and what thei r ideal method for referral was. We also sought feedback on what could be improved upon in the process of screening and referring. Results The initial quality improvement interviews revealed that few patients were being screened and even fewer were being referred with the new virtual format. It was found that formal screening had completely ceased since many patients were being seen virtually . There was also little in person screening since work flows had changed when Northeast was consolidated with Wingra Clinic. Many providers noted they relied heavily on the paper screening form as that was often the prompt to discuss those concerns. This information lead to the development of the new screening and referral process. After implementing new workflows in December 2020, the most recent survey , completed spring 2021, showed improvements in connecting patients to resources. Screening was happening more consistently , though not at every visit as intend ed, and the navigators were receiving more new referrals from providers. If there was an identified social need , the most common workflow was providers contact ing the navigators on the patient 's behalf . The most common concerns identified by providers included not all patients received the screening form, not knowing if their patient was able to be reached by the navigators, and what resources their patient was utilizing , if any . Conclusion With the new work flows, we have been able to connect patient s to the resource navigators despite them not being physically located in clinic. At the start of the transition to the virtual format there was a sharp decline in referrals . The goal of improving this was certainly met with the workflow changes. This has allowed continued access to more social supports that patients highly value and need. In feedback from providers there are still improvements that need to be made. One of the largest being providers not receiving feedback if the navigat ors were able to connect with their patients and what resources the navigators are providing. There was also a large desire to have the navigators return to being in person when able. There is less of a barrier to communication when a provider can bring a patient to the navigator desk and connect in- person. These areas would be great next steps to continue to enhance the program. There is a lot of value in gathering data about the topic/project and getting other people's perspectives. It helps to see multi ple perspectives and learn how others practice. By taking a more step wise approach , we were able to be more thoughtful in how we developed workflows that would benefit the most number of patients and providers. The partnership with the navigators was also key. It was valuable to learn how the virtual format has impacted the navigators work so we could improve the process. Acknowledgments First I need to thank the Patient Resource Navigators , Lane Hanson, MSW and all the undergraduate students. They are a huge asset to the patients at Northeast and have continued to go above and beyond in the past year to support patients, despite not being physically present in clinic. Second, to KJ Hansmann, MD who is an excellent leader and teacher. I had min imal experience in quality improvement projects and she was very supportive and patient during the learning process. Third, Jennifer Edgoose , MD, MPH who is always an advocate for patient s and a guiding light in community health awareness. Fourth, Julia Alb erth for her hard work on the quality improvement interviews and poster she created. And last , but certainly not least, Bob Freidel , MD who is a technology whiz and excellent leader in helping to create work flows and assess how providers are utilizing the new formats.

After review of several timely, well powered studies including a meta-analysis of RCTs, retrospective cohort study and post-hoc analysis we concluded that current evidence supports that elderly patients do benefit from statin use as soon as 2 years of use. However, these studies were limited and statins do have risks and should be discussed with elderly patients individually. There are two current randomized controlled studies which we hope will provide further evidence for statin use in elderly patients. I would like to thank my husband, family and friends who have been so supportive during this journey! I would also like to thank my amazing co-residents and the supportive faculty who I will miss dearly. To the Belleville clinic staff, I can never thank you enough for making Belleville clinic feel like home. To the residency staff, thank you so much for all of your help!Increasing Support for C aregivers of E lderly Patients with D ementia in the Belleville Community Samantha Mayhew, MD Background In an effort to decrease acute care services needed by elderly patients with dementia, Dr. Manish Shah of the UW Emergency Department and his research team collaborated with the Belleville clinic to pilot a coaching program for caregivers of patients with dementia. The key community partners included the coaches themselves who were local community paramedics as well as collaboration with the local senior citizen center . Prior programs like REACH ( Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health ) have proven interventions in a community setting improve the caregiver's experience. Our particular pilot program was specific to the population of the Belleville clinic and focused on the effects of the program on the health of the patients with dementia and their care partners as well as the psychosocial effects. Objectives The goal of this pilot was to decrease acute care services used by eld erly patients as well as their caregivers and to improve the health of patients with dementia and their care partners who lived with them. My role included assisting with inclusion criteria for the program, recruiting patients, reaching out to other reside nt physicians to recruit their patients and following up every 1 -2 weeks with the research and clinical teams via virtual meetings. Methods Patients and caregivers would first meet with their primary care physician at Belleville Clinic. If they met the eligibility criteria and had interest in the program, the PCP would refer to the clinic's RN care coordinator. If eligible and they wanted to participate in the pilot they would then be enrolled. A coach would then meet with the patient and caregiver in th eir home, the coach would then document the visit and any concerns they might have, this would be recorded in the EMR and the PCP could then help act on any concerns. The coach would then schedule follow up at the home based on the patient and caregiver's needs for a total of 6 months. Results The current pilot program has been well received by patients, caregivers and their providers thus far. The coaches entering patient's homes has provided significant information to the RN Care Coordinator and PCPs t hat has allowed for better understanding of patient and caregiver's daily lives, the challenges they may face and allows for higher quality of care from PCPs. My patients and their caregivers who have participated have voiced feelings of support and the caregivers have felt more confident caring for the patient at home. Of my patients who participated, we were able to address concerns through their coaches and the RN Care Coordinator, they did not require any acute office or ER visits while participating in the pilot program. Conclusions The use of medically trained coaches for caregivers of elderly patients with dementia residing in rural WI provided benefit to the patient, caregiver and their medical providers. Further analysis of data will be done in t he future to assess use of acute care visits and the health of the patient as well as the caregiver. The pilot did occur during the COVID- 19 pandemic which halted some visits in the home. Another challenge with the program was patients or caregivers that d id not want a coach to enter their home or did not feel they needed any assistance. Next steps for this community activity include broadening the scope of participants to more patients, and likely patients who do not have dementia but would still benefit f rom a medically trained coach. Acknowledgements A huge thank you to Dr. Julia Lubsen whose participation was critical to the pilot itself and whose support was critical to my involvement. Dr. Manish Shah for inviting me to participate in the above pilot as well as his research team with Gwen Jacobsohn and Apoorva Maru who created the pilot, obtained the data and headed the weekly meetings. To Gail Campbell who was a spectacular coach to the Belleville patients. To Caroline Templeton the RN Care Coordinator who kept us all in the loop and communicated with the coaches and patients frequently. Most importantly, to all of the patients and caregivers who participated and hopefully benefited from the program! Courtney Reynolds, MD Projects Completed During Residency: Scholarly Project: Quality Improvement Project: Courtney Reynolds grew up in Cross Plains and calls Wisconsin her home. Her focus is on the health of her patients and on the health of her community; she enjoys listening to her patients and being an involved community member. She earned her bachelor's and medical degree from the University of Wisconsin - Madison. Prior to residency, Courtneywas a volunteer emergency medicaltechnician in Mazomanie, WI whereshe provided emergency services andengaged in community events focusingon education and awareness. She helpeddevelop a program in Rice Lake, WI toexpand Reach Out and Read principlesbeyond well child visits into the clinicwaiting room and community. Courtneyparticipated in the Medical StudentsOffering Maternal Support programwhere she was a member of a first timemom's support system and attendedher prenatal appointments and delivery.From this, she learned to appreciate thevulnerabilities of patients, the importanceof the doctor-patient relationship, andthe necessity of patient educationfocusing on the individual. Duringresidency Courtney served on the ethicscommittee as well as obstetric/newborncommittee. Courtney has a strongpassion for obstetrics, women's health,and treating the entire family. Courtneyenjoys the great outdoors throughcamper camping, traveling, hiking, and spending time on the lake. She relaxes by painting, knitting, crafting, and reading. She is thankful every day for her husband and2 children.Immune Mechanisms of Breastfeeding and the Role of Vaccinations Improving Accuracy of Patient Medication Lists: During my residency I identified that patient medication lists were not always updated. I found this more common with patients that were not part of my panel or with patients who came in for an urgent care type visit. My goal was to improve my percentage of accurate medication lists and I felt the major barrier to this was time. My intervention included carving out a few minutes with each visit dedicated to med list review regardless of a patient's concern. I found my rate of updating/accurate medication lists improved from 63% to 82%. I am so thankful to my spouse that has been with me every step of the way. Even on the hardest days: the kids are screamin g, dinner plans fell through, they are hungry and need baths, I'm behind on laundry, where are their pajamas? Are we out of diapers again? And the phone rings because my patient 's water broke and is in labor. Thank you for always picking up the slack and allowing me to follow my dreams, especially during this year with COVID, the lack of child care back up, and the countless times you sacrificed your own work for mine. Thank you.Immune mechanisms of breastfeeding and the role of vaccinations Courtney Reynolds, FM PGY-3 Objectives Review basic immune system concepts Discuss benefits of breastfeeding Discuss composition of breastmilk Discuss immunity re lated to breastmilk Review types of vaccines Discuss infant vaccination efficacy while breastfeeding Discuss maternal vaccination while breastfeeding Discuss considerations for specific vaccinations Influenza Tdap COVID19 Breastfeeding recommendations during COVID19 Brief review of immunity Innate Immune system : Inherited -first-line barrier, rapid-response mechanism Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), toll-like receptors Physical barriers - Tight junctions, mucus Antimicrobial enzymes (ex, lysozyme) Serum proteins other Adaptive Immune system B lymphocytes - Antibodies Cellular response: T lymphocytes - helper, cytotoxic, and regulatory Passive Immunity : External antibodies are given Maternal to fetal transplacental transfer Antibody-containing blood products such as immune globulin Protection is immediate but only lasts for a few weeks to months Active Immunity : Internal antibodies are produced Natural: Exposure through infection with the actual disease Vaccine Induced: introduction of a killed or weakened form of the disease Protection takes days to weeks to develop but is long-lasting, and sometimes life-long Benefits of BreastfeedingSkin to skin as analgesiaSkin to skin for late preterm infants: increase blood glucose levels and improve cardiorespiratory stabilityFor preterm infants: increase intestinal lactase, decrease intestinal permeability and decrease risk of necrotizing enterocolitis Prevention of acute illness In low and middle resource countries: decreased childhood mortalityDecreases risk of developing DMT1 Decreases risk of developing IBD Has lower incidence of wheezing in early childhood Decreases rate of dental caries Slightly higher IQ (even after adjusting for maternal intelligence)Lower incidence of retinopathy of prematurity Some evidence for: Decreases risk of childhood lymphoma and leukemiaDecreases risk of childhood obesityLower BP (by 1 mmHg) Decreases risk of Celiac diseaseDecreases risk of developing DMT2 Prevention of acute illnessLower risk gastroenteritis and diarrhea (both low and high resource settings) Lower risk of lower respiratory tract infectionsIn the US estimated that \"optimizing\" breastfeeding would prevent 21,000 hospitalizations and 40 deaths in the first year of life.

Several studies have shown improve response to vaccines in breastfed infants compared to formula fed in fants. BUT there is a lot of MIXED data. Review in Am J perinatology, Jos\u00e9 G. D\u00f3rea, Ph.D. reviewed >50 studies. A few studies: breast-fed infants showed significantly higher poliovirus vaccine response at 6 and 12 months. A few studies: breast-fed infants showed lower rates of seroconversion after rotavirus vaccination. Mexican study: higher maternal antibody concentrations of rotavirus was associated with lower rotavirus vaccine responses during infancy. Demographics/pathogen exposures? Nigerian study: measles antibodies in maternal sera or breast milk did not interfere with measles vaccination So far the data is inconclusive.Breastfeeding in several studies has shown to decrease infant vaccination efficacy to oral vaccinations A possible explanation: mothers tend to breast-feed infants during the immunization visits - higher titers of IgA and neutralizing activity in breast milk One study: evaluated delaying breast-feeding at the time of rotavirus immunization No affect on antibody response. Another study: evaluated withholding breast-feeding for 3 hours before immunization with oral cholera vaccine Did increase antibody response Study compared poliovirus and rotavirus vaccinations which both replicate in the gut Simultaneous administration of polio and rotavirus vaccines in breast-fed infants caused a significant reduction in antibody response to rotavirus but not to polioviruses. Breast milk contains rotavirus specific (IgA) and nonspecific inhibitors (mucin and anti-trypsin) of rotavirus replication.Mostly seen with rotavirus. Roles of vaccination and breastfeeding in relation to: Maternal Vaccination Maternal vaccination and breastfeeding Contraindicated: yellow fever (live attenuated) A Few infants have been infected with yellow fever via breast milk of vaccinated mothers (few cases of encephalitis). Study: 11 women who were inadvertently vaccinated, none had detectable yellow fever vaccine RNA in their milk Contraindicated: small pox (live attenuated) Theoretical Per CDC all other vaccinations are OK during lactation. Even live: Influenza, MMR, Varicella and Typhoid (Ty21a). With a caveat. Maternal vaccination promotes passive immunity. MMR showed measles-specific IgG in colostrum and breast milk and afforded protection to breastfed infants for a few weeks (unclear when vaccinated) Neisseria meningococcal vaccine: elevated N. meningitidis-specific IgA antibodies in breast milk, up to six months post-partum (unclear when vaccinated) Pertussis immunization during postpartum period: elevated pertussis antigen-specific IgA antibodies in breast milk killed polio vaccination: increase in IgA antibo dies in breast milk (unclear when vaccinated)Mostly... Maternal vaccination with live vaccinati ons appears to DECREASE breastmilk SIgA Live poliovirus vaccine Live salmonella typhi Specific Vaccinations: Influenza Tdap COVID19 Influenza According to the CDC, on average, about 8% of the U.S. population gets sick (symptomatic) from influenza each season, with a range of between 3% and 11% Children are the most likely to get sick from influenza and under 5 are in the high risk category for complications People 65 and older are least likely to get sick from influenza but are in the high risk category for complications In children under 5, CDC estimates: 7,000 to 26,000 flu-related hospitalizations in the United States since 2010. 37 to 188 deaths per season since 2004-2005 During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, 358 pediatric flu-related deaths were reported to CDC from April 2009 to September 2010 During 2017-2018, 188 deaths in children were reported to CDC but statistical modeling suggests approximately 600 deaths may have occurred. Among reported pediatric deaths, about 80% of those children were not fully vaccinated. Vaccination is NOT recommended if <6 months of ageMaternal influenza vaccination during pregnancy Reduces pregnant women's risk for influenza-associated hospitalization by an average of 40% Reduces influenza-associated hospitalization risk in infants aged <6 months by an average of 72% Study: Maternal immunization during the third trimester and breastfed their infants for an average of 14 weeks. During first 6 months of life infants had: 36% reduction in respiratory illness with fever 63% reduction in laboratory-confirmed influenza This study was not able to differentiate between transplacental vs. breast milk protection Maternal influenza vaccination during lactation IgG and IgA antibodies have b een identified in breast milk Breastmilk antibody responses are higher with the inactivated influenza vaccine than with the live oral vaccine Live attenuated maternal vaccination had more fussiness (60%) when compared to the inactivated vaccine (45%) Inactivated over live vaccination is preferred. Diphtheria Disease is caused by a toxin produced by bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae that destroys tissue leading to \"pseudomembrane\" and swollen \"bull neck\" - airway obstruction, skin lesions and myocarditis Before vaccines, diphtheria was a leading cause of childhood death around the world, including in the United States. Today, is nearly unheard of in the US but still present around the world. In 2018, more than 16,000 cases of diphtheria were reported to the WHO likely more unreported. Pertussis - Whooping cough Disease caused by bacteria Bordetella pertussis which produces a toxin About half of babies younger than 1 year old need care in the hospital. The younger the baby, the more likely they will need treatment in the hospital. Of hospitalized infants: 1 out of 4 (23%) get pneumonia 1 out of 100 (1.1%) will have seizures 3 out of 5 (61%) will have apnea 1 out of 300 (0.3%) will have encephalopathy 1 out of 100 (1%) will die Worldwide, estimated 24.1 million cases of pertussis and about 160,700 deaths per year Since the 1950s, Cases of pertussis in the US peaked in 2012, CDC reported 48,277 (likely more unreported) Maternal Tdap Vaccination It is recommended all pregnant wome n receive Tdap with every pregnancy. Vaccination after 20 weeks of gestation is associated with higher antipertussis IgA levels in their breastmilk In infants aged <2 months, Third-trimester maternal Tdap vaccination is 77.7% effective in preventing pertussis cases 90.5% effective in preventing pertussis hospitalizations Nursing mothers, who did not receive Tdap previously should be vaccinated with Tdap immediately postpartum. Pertussis-specific antibodies appear in breastmilk within 1 to 2 weeks But, mixed data if breastfed infants are protected from pertussis Recommended DURING pregnancy over postpartum COVID19 As of 1/19/2021: 96,120,244 global cases with 2,054,560 deaths 24,247,006 US cases with 401,586 deaths COVID-19 mRNA Vaccination and Breastfeeding No non-live vaccines have ever been reported to cause infant adverse effects via breastfeeding. Composition: mRNA is encapsulated within lipid nanoparticles Nanoparticles: microscopic mixtures of specialized fats, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol mRNA translates for the SARS-CoV-2 S \"spike\" protein. The proteins are processed into peptides that are displayed on the cell surface, which then stimulates the antiviral immune response. There is no plausible mechanism for intact viral S proteins to be distributed into the milk from the maternal circulation after immunization. Any intact vaccine lipid nanoparticles that are excreted into breastmilk and ingested orally by the infant during feeding would be destroyed in the infant's gastrointestinal tract , which is a major reason why lipid nanoparticle-assisted RNA vaccines are limited to the parenteral route. The tiny amount of polyethylene glycol-2000 in Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is not absorbed orally , so infant breastmilk PEG exposure from maternal immunization is not a concern. Neither of the currently available vaccines contains a preservative or adjuvant. Breastfeeding during COVID19 infection is recommended Is SARS-CoV-2 IN breast milk? Unlikely Review of 14 studies that had tested human milk for human coronaviruses directly. 48 milk samples. All but one of these samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, and that result was reported from nonreliable source Are SARS-CoV-2 antibodies IN breast milk? YES Study found SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA in breast milk from infected patients. Looked at antibody binding to the Spike protein. All samples exhibited significant specific antibody reactivity to the full Spike protein. 80% exhibited significant IgA binding 67% samples exhibited IgG and/or IgM binding No clear demonstration of transmission via breastmilk No clear demonstration of breastmilk protection clinically But the basic science is there Isolation and quarantine The breastfeeding person COVID-19 should follow home isolation. The child is considered as a close contact of a person with COVI D-19, and should be quarantined for the duration of the lactati ng parent's recommended period of home isolation AND during their own quarantine thereafter. Precautions while feeding at the breast, expressing milk, or feeding from a bottle - during their recommended period of home isolation: Wash their hands using soap and water before touching their child or expressing breast milk either by hand expression or with a breast pump. 2ndline: hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Wear a mask when they are less than 6 feet from the child AND when expressing breast milk Clean and sanitize breast pumps If the breastfeeding person is not well enough to feed a caregiver who is not at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-1 9m a y feed expressed breast milk to the child. They should wear a mask for the duration of the lactating parent's recommended period of home isolation and during their own quarantine thereafter.Scenario: Breastfeeding PERSON has suspected or confirmed COVID-19, but breastfed child does not. Isolation and quarantine The breastfed child with COVID-19 should follow home isolation. Mom is considered as a close contact of a person with COVID-19, and should be quarantined for the duration of the breastfeeding child's recommended period of home isolation AND during their own quarantine thereafter. Precautions while feeding at the breast, expressing milk, or feeding from a bottle - during their recommended period of home isolation: Breastfeeding person should wash th eir hands using soap and water before and after touching their child 2ndline: hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Breastfeeding person should wear a mask Never use a mask on child less than 2 years old. Scenario: Breastfed CHILD has suspected or confirmed COVID-19, but breastfeeding person does not. Summary Breastfeeding has many benefits, most are dose dependent. Encourage exclusive breastfeeding. AAFP/AAP recommend exclusive feeding until 6 months and continuing through at least the first year as solids are introduced. Few contraindications to breastfeed: Galactosemia type 1, HIV. Breastmilk has many immune properties: antimicrobial and immunomodulatory that over protection and help develop the infant immune system. Breastmilk CAN treat eczema and diaper dermatitis (NOT AOM or conjunctivitis). Infant vaccination efficacy can be affected by but data in inconclusive for most other than improved IPV response and decreased oral rotavirus response. Not breastfeeding prior to immunization may be beneficial but more research needed. All vaccinations so far are recommended during lactatio n other than yellow fever and theoretically small pox. Maternal vaccination does generate antibodies in breastmilk. A few live vaccines however decrease breastmilk antibodies (polio and salmonella). Influenza vaccination during pregnancy and lactation is recommended and does show clinical benefit. During lactation inactivated influenza vaccination is preferred over oral/live for better immune response. Maternal Tdap vaccination shows clear benefit when given during pregnancy, less data postpartum but still recommended. COVID19 vaccination appears safe during breastfeeding. Antibodies have been found in breastmilk and are functional at the basic science level. Clinical correlations not yet defined. Breastfeeding is recommend during maternal or infant COVID19 infection with recommended precautions. References - Articles Andreas NJ, Kampmann B, Mehring Le-Doare K.

Knee arthroscopy is becoming a more common procedure with an associated increased risk of VTE which raises the question of the most appropriate prophylaxis that is indicated. Chemoprophylaxis for venous thrombosis prevention is not recommended after knee arthroscopy. There is no strong evidence that thromboprophylaxis is effective in preventing thromboembolic events in adults with unknown risk factors following knee arthroscopy, although there are increased odds of venous thromboembolism after ACL reconstruction in patients with increased risks for venous thrombosis. To say that I have had amazing support throughout my medical education is an understatement. An extra special thank you to my parents and sister for their constant patience with the endless phone calls with wise counsel (especially urology curbsides courtesy of Dr. E Salter). Over the past three years my amazing co-residents have become family and I never would have survived this without them, not to mention the entire one of a kind Wingra family! I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to learn how to become an amazing doctor from an amazing group of attendings! Wingra Resource Navigator Program J onathan Christ, MD & Carly Salter, MD B ackground The Wingra Resource Navigator P rogram is aimed to identify Wingra patients who are in need of essentials that play a role in their health such as food, housing, transportation, etc. The patient populations we serve at Wingra Clinic are often disadvantaged financially and use our clinic as their main community resource. With the assistance of prior project contributors familiar with the Resource Navigator program at our clinic, undergraduate student navigator volunteers were trained to assist the social work team in connecting our patients with the community resource they needed. O bjectives Ou r goal was to further integrate the resource navigators into the workflow at Wingra Clinic since there was little communication between providers and the navigators. We sought to integrate the navigators into clinic huddles and provide them with the list of patients being seen in the clinic the following day so that they could be aware of when their patients were being seen in clinic. This would enable them to reach out to providers in order to work together on addressing the patients' needs since they do not have access to our electronic medical record. We also strove to increase awareness about the Resource Navigator program among providers in clinic. Me thods W e held meetings with clinic leadership and resource navigator leaders to identify disconnects between providers and student navigators. D uring a resident education afternoon at Wingra in Fall 2019, we presented the background information about the resource navigators to the providers in clinic and encouraged providers to reach out about patients with concerns about resources. S creening forms were created during the COVID- 19 pandemic and handed to patients at check in and were to be returned and collected by Sheray Wallace to identify individuals in need. R esults The daily patient schedule was printed out by the reception staff on the day prior and given to the resource navigators so that they could identify when their patients would be seen and would reach out to providers prior to the visits. This was implemented and a few weeks later, the COVID- 19 shutdown was implemented and navigators were removed from clinic. T he resident education afternoon increased awareness of the Resource Navigator Program and its potential role in the care of our patients. T he screening forms were infrequently filled out because patients were simply handed the forms without an explanation of what they were for and just threw them away or took them home with them. C onclusion s The impact of our efforts to connect clinic providers and student navigators was complicated by the onset of the COVID- 19 pandemic as the student navigators that were an integral component to our improvement plan were no longer present in the clinic as a p recaution. Prior to the pandemic, our efforts at resident education afternoons increased clinic utilization of the student navigators as a resource to identify and connect patients to their needed resources. The implemented screening forms created during the pandemic helped Sheray Wallace and the student navigator team stay connected with in need patients despite their absence at Wingra Clinic.

Measles - Globally, one in 7 children is under vaccinated. - Measles requires 95% of the population to be immunized to achieve herd immunity - In 2000, measles was declared to be eliminated in the US - In 2019, we had 1,282 cases in 31 states - In most cases, a traveler from a poorly vaccinated country spread measles in an inadequately vaccinated US community (9). Vaccine Hesitancy -Delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccine services. Varies across time, place and vaccines. It is influenced by: -complacency -convenience -confidence (7) - Convenience and complacency are the greatest barriers - Ex: ease of religious exemption in the US. - Humans feel greater moral responsibility for harm done in action than harm done in inaction (9) Health Workers in Ghana carrying vaccines by hand (WHO 2020) https://www.who.int/news-room/photo-story/photo-story-detail/malaria-and- immunization-heroesVaccine Hesitancy In the -25- vaccinate children despite minor concerns -20- 30% vaccinate but have significant (safety) concerns -up to 27% accept some vaccines, not others -2% decline all vaccines (9)Dolly Parton adapts her song Jolene as she receives Covid-19 vaccine she helped fund Report of the SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy. World Health Organization (2014). doi:https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=SAGE+VACCINE+HESITANCY+WORKING+GROUP Anti Vaccination themes from 1800's on... -Toxicity: vaccines are toxic/ have toxic ingredients and healthy behaviors/ organic foods are just as effective in preventing the spread of disease. -Religiosity: vaccine contains materials objectionable on religious grounds -Liberty: individuals should have health freedom/ medical choice instead of requirements to immunize -Distrust of industry: concern that vaccines are produced by profit- motivated pharmaceutical companies. -Safety: concern for SIDS, autism, seizures from vaccines. -Conspiracy: distrust of government and authority figures such as Bill Gates (9).History of the modern Western Anti- Vaccine Movement - Whole cell pertussis vaccine caused febrile seizures in the 1970's- 1990's. - Gordon Steward made unsubstantiated claims that 1 in 50,000 pertussis vaccines caused brain damage. - In England and Wales, rates of pertussis vaccination dropped from 77% to 30% from 1974 to 1978. - 5,000 British children were hospitalized, 20% of whom suffered pneumonia, and some suffered permanent cognitive deficits from meningitis. - In 1982, there was a televised expose of the dangers of the Pertussis vaccine in the US, accompanied by lawsuits by parents of disabled children. - Liability concerns caused vaccine manufacturers in the US to leave the market - Worried about low vaccine supplies, Congress created a no fault administrative court in 1986 to consider vaccine harm allegations and provide monetary compensation, protecting manufacturers from liability. - This was followed by Andrew Wakefield in the 1990's who claimed that the MMR vaccine caused autism. - In Feb 2020, a study of 2,500 US adults found that 20% were misinformed about vaccines (9)WHO: TAILORING IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM Identified target population Used surveys to determine the major factors underlying hesitancy Tailored intervention strategy to address these factors Evaluated outcome. It is about trust: people believe messages from other consumers more from companies. There was no \"magic bullet\" (7) Robert Kapininga, a nurse assistant, gives baby Lusitana the first dose of the world's first malaria vaccine. Photo: WHO/ M. Nieuwenhof 2020 https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/lusitana-and-the-world-s-first-malaria-vaccine Physician Recommendation -What does not work? Communicating GRAVITY of DISEASE or EFFICACY of VACCINE. -The decision to immunize is shaped by a patient's perception of social norms. -Physician recommendations can influence social norms -Recommendation by provider with longitudinal relationship with the family raises vaccination rates. -Direct physician recommendation was the #1 factor cited in increasing the uptake of HPV vaccines. -Strength of physician recommendation significantly affected vaccine uptake (5). -Presumptive language is more effective: ex \"Now that Harry is 12, he is due for 3 vaccines, including vaccines against meningitis, HPV cancers, and whooping cough.\" (9) Tools To Use During Your Discussions Vaccine Approval Process 1. Research and Discovery Stage: laboratory based ideas of how a vaccine may work 2. Pre- clinical: phase: animal based testing to see if human trials would be safe and effective 3. Clinical Development : Researchers submit an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the FDA. The FDA ensures that pre clinic studies were done according to good laboratory practices and whether it would be safe to move on to human trials. a. Phase 1: 20- 100 volunteers not yet exposed to the disease. Tested for adverse reactions and whether immune response is developed b. IF no safety concerns from Phase 1, move to Phase 2. Placebo controlled testing done on 100's of people with varying medical problems to see if it is safe. c. If no safety concerns from above, move to Phase 3: Placebo controlled vaccine administration to thousands of people, generating effectiveness and safety data. Less common side effects are found. 4. During clinical development, the FDA works with the manufacturer to develop a lot release protocol. Each produced lot of vaccines has to pass testing for purity, potency, identity, and sterility to be released by the FDA for distribution (3) Vaccine Monitoring VAERS: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System: Database on unverified report of adverse events following immunization with US licensed vaccines. Anyone can submit a report or download data to search at www.vaers.hhs.gov . There is a search tool, WONDER that you can use to search: wonder. https://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html (10) CDC Vaccine Safety Datalink : partners with health care corporations around the country and uses their EMR records to track vaccines administered and illnesses or events sustained. This allows rapid reporting of adverse effects linked to vaccines. The incidences of illnesses among vaccinated persons are compared to incidences of the same illnesses among unvaccinated persons and used to inform vaccine safety. This is a primary method for tracking vaccine safety in pregnant women (11).Example, RotaShield Rotashield was a vaccine introduced in 1998, recommended to children at 2, 4, 6 months of age. -A few months after it was introduced, there were 15 cases of intussusception reported to VERS -At baseline, before introduction of the vaccine, this occurred in about 1 in 2,000 children. A question arose: does Rotashield cause more intussusception than at baseline? The Vaccine Safety Datalink was used to investigate medical records of children with and without the vaccine. The vaccine caused an extra 1, in 10,000 children to get intussusception. Rotashield was taken off of the market (6)Baraboo News Republic Friday March 26, 2021 How could the COVID-19 vaccine develop so fast? 1. We can now rapidly sequence the genes of both humans and pathogens. The COVID-19 genetic sequence was available in January 2020. 2. Global scientists used existing data from the MERS vaccine to do the pre- clinical work targeting COVID-19. 3. Vaccines were under development at the same time that most of us entered quarantine in 2020. Moderna's Phase 1 clinical trials to begin on March 16, 2020. Other companies began in April. 4. COVID-19 is very infectious, allowing companies to compare the rates of illness in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated persons in a shorter time frame that other diseases would allow. (4) What is Emergency Use Authorization? Emergency Use Authorization: allows availability and use of medical treatments and vaccines during public health emergencies. - Vaccines had to complete testing on tens of thousands of study participants. Before submitting an application for emergency use, vaccine manufacturers had to finish clinical phase 1&2 and be in the process of completing phase 3 trials. - They had to follow up for adverse effects for at least 2 months. - The FDA also evaluated the chemistry, manufacturing and quality control for vaccine production. (2)Vaccine Education Center: CHOP https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education -center Paul Offit, MD Pediatric Infectious Disease Vaccine information for pregnancy Vaccine information for parents of infants Disease specific and concern specific information Parents PACK newsletter and parent group Common Q&A: Are Vaccines Safe? Safety: benefit outweighs risk. Vaccines are not harmless but they also prevent real disease. Ex: Hepatitis B: the disease kills about 1,700 persons a year in the US. It causes many more to have liver disease. 1-2 million people have it without knowing it. Infants can get it by being exposed to other adults. You can get it through exposure to microscopic amounts of another person's blood. The vaccine: 1 in 1 million doses is complicated by anaphylaxis. There are 4 million babies born in the US per year. If each received 3 doses of the vaccine, we could have up to 12 cases of anaphylaxis per year. The benefit is avoiding 1,700 deaths. The risk is 12 cases of anaphylaxis (6)Vaccine Schedule and Number 2. Why do we have to give the vaccines at such a young age? -Most of the vaccines we have were developed to combat diseases that killed and permanently disabled infants. -The infantile immune system is more robust than the adult immune system. For example, the older a person is, the less likely the Hepatitis B vaccine is to produce an effective immune response. 3. Aren't these too many vaccines? -A child has the capacity to respond to approximately 10,000 vaccines at one time. The immune system can make about 2 billion white blood cells a day to respond to pathogens. Modern vaccines also use fewer proteins than older vaccines did. For example, smallpox, a common vaccine in the early 1900's contained about 200 proteins. The whole cell pertussis vaccine in the 1980's contained 3,000 proteins. Now all of our childhood vaccines combined contain about 160 proteins. Alternative schedules, links to chronic disease 3. What about an alternative vaccine schedule? - It increases the time during which children are susceptible to vaccine preventable diseases. - Children produce the same amount of stress hormone (cortisol) whether they get one shot or multiple. Spacing out vaccines therefore causes more stress. 4. Do vaccines cause chronic diseases? - We know that MS is worse during influenza season because influenza proteins can mimic myelin basic protein. Persons with MS can inadvertently have heightened autoimmunity to the myelin on their nerves when combatting influenza. The influenza vaccine contains myelin protein. Studies, however, have found that the influenza vaccine cannot cause the same worsening of MS symptoms that the influenza illness does.Vaccines and Autism 5. Do vaccines cause autism? On Feb 28, 1998, Andrew Wakefield, et, al published an article in the Lancet, a British newspaper, regarding 12 children with Autism, 8 of whom had had the MMR vaccine, and one of whom had Measles. The paper stated that viral encephalitis does cause autism. It states \"We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described (Wakefield, 1998).\" 12 further studies, involving thousands of children, failed to find an association between the MMR vaccine and autism. In 1999 the American Academy of Pediatrics asked that thimerosal be removed from children's vaccines, even though research did not find any sign of mercury poisoning or autism from this preservative. There was no change in rate of autism between children given all their vaccines on time and those with delayed vaccines. Concern about Harmful Additives Thimerosal - Removed from childhood vaccines in 2001 - Previously, caused a dose of about 200 mcg of methylmercury throughout the entire childhood - Breastfed babies ingest 400 mcg of methylmercury through breast milk in the first 6 months of life. - When children who received thimerserol were compared to those who had not, there was no difference found in risk of autism or mercury poisoning. - The adjuvant to enhance the immune response. - It is the third most abundant element on earth and in all of our foods. - A breastfed baby will eat 10 mg by 6 months of age - A formula fed baby will eat 30 mg by 6 months - A soy formula fed baby will eat 120 mg by 6 months of age. - Vaccines: 4 mg of aluminum in 6 months. Aluminum Formaldehyde - Used to inactivate the polio and Hep A virus and bacterial toxins (diptheria, tetanus). - Formaldehyde can damage DNA and causes cancerous changes in lab cells. - Formaldehyde has not been found to cause cancer in human beings. - Formaldehyde is part of the metabolism of thymidine, purines, amino acids. Every human makes formaldehyde and has it in their blood. - The average 11 lb infant would have 1 milligram of formaldehyde in it's blood due to natural metabolic processes. This is ten times the amount of formaldehyde found in a vaccine. https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boswell-glass-embalming-bottle-houseAborted Human Fetal Cells - Two elective abortions in the early 1960's - Sweden: human fetal cells went to the Wistar Institute: cells WI-38-> rubella and rabies vaccines - England : cells went to the Medical Research Council: cells MRC-05 -> rubella, rabies, chicken pox, hepatitis A vaccines - Pope Benedict XVI reasoned that giving vaccines from human fetal cells \"does not indicate any negative moral value when compared to the greater good of preventing life threatening infections\"Questions?

The multifaceted program occurs once monthly and incorporates a nutrition, exercise, educational and goal-setting component within each session. My specific roles included active participation in movement/exercise sessions, assisting in group discussions and educational sessions, leading goal- setting sessions, and offering additional support for the program participants. I also helped facilitate a virtual format in lieu of the in-person classes during the COVID pandemic. I'd like to say thank you to my family and friends who have provided endless support over the years. To my parents, who were always understanding, willing to lend a hand or a listening ear, I couldn't have done it without you. Special thank you to my sister for her mentorship in medicine and for always raising the bar high. Thank you to my mentors, near and far, for your guidance, compassion, and support.

Nick is a native Wisconsinite, hailing from Altoona (near Eau Claire). He earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Wisconsin - River Falls before moving to Minneapolis for 2 years. He then earned his medical degree from the T ulane University School of Medicine. Nick's family medicine clerkship in Opelousas, LA showed him what kind of doctor he wanted to be - one that fosters strong relationships with patients, sees a wide variety of conditions, and does many procedures. This experience also showed him the benefits of practicing rural medicine and living in a small town. He looks forward to knowing each of his patients personally and adapting his care for their unique situations. In his patient care, Nick focuses on prevention and follow-up as he works with patients to manage acute and chronic illnesses. Outside of medicine, Nick enjoys playing video games and chess, reading fantasy novels, and exploring nature through hiking and fishing.Obstetrical Care Training for Belleville EMS Expanding Rural Training Options in Family Medicine: The Rural Health Equity Track (RHET) and Rural Pathway and UW-Madison: The Rural Health Equity Track (RHET) was a new addition to the UW-Madison curriculum that was started in the 2017-2018 academic year. The goal was to prepare residents to be leaders in improving rural healthcare. This was accomplished through a leadership curriculum, networking opportunities with rural health advocates, rural free clinic, and rotations within critical access hospitals across the state. This has continued to evolve over time. In the words of Lou Sanner, \"we're building the plane as we fly.\" There were numerous hurdles and challenges but ultimately it has been an extremely beneficial presence within our residency. We presented a poster with these findings at the World Organization of Family Doctors conference in Albuquerque, NM in 2019. Residency was by far the biggest hurdle in my life, but also the biggest opportunity for growth. My biggest thanks has to go to my wife, Stephanie. Without her, residency would have been significantly more challenging. I would also like to thank my co- residents who made the journey enjoyable and filled with laughter. Our faculty have been amazing and nothing but supportive. It's been great, but I'd never want to have to do it again.Obstetrical Care Training for Belleville EMS Nicholas Squires, MD Background Obstetrical care is something that frequently strikes fear into the hearts of emergency medical service (EMS) personnel. It tends to be a rare patient encounter for rural EMS providers so many felt it was outside of their comfort zone. It also carries the potential for devastating outcomes. Physiology in pregnancy changes dramatically and many medications are contraindicated. Fortunately, we have an ongoing relationship with Belleville EMS through our clinic thanks to our clinic director , Jen Lochner . She has been working with them longitudinally for years on various projects. Belleville EMS identified obstetrical care as a weakness and felt dedicated education would be highly beneficial. They felt that many other surrounding communities also viewed obstetrical care as a weakness. We settled on a \"train the trainer\" model to allow us to disperse information to 1 -2 representatives from each surrounding community EMS group to aid in education to their employees. Objective Our goal was to identify and carry out an effective training regimen for EMS employees of surrounding rural communities. We brainstormed numerous different ways to carry out the training ranging from personally devised Power Point presentations on dedicated topics to formalized curriculum that were already in place. With the help of Ann Evensen, we settled on the Basic Life Saving in Obstetrics (BLSO) program. This is a program through the American Academy of Family Physicians to improve the management of normal deliveries as well as obstetric emergencies by standardizing the skills of first responders. It is specifically for pre -hospital care providers. Methods Patrick McDonnell from Belleville EMS was able to advertise the BL SO event through the UW Emergency Education Center to disseminate the opportunity to surrounding communities. This allowed us to pull together personnel from several other townships . We were able to acquire the Epic campus as our training location. Funding for the course came from the EMS training budget. Adult mannequins were available from the Department of Family Medicine and neonatal masks were available through the Belleville EMS. The instructors for the course were Ann Evensen and Lee Dresang, who als o helped create the BLSO program. We also had several resident/fellow instructors including Danielle Hartwig, Lashika Yogendran, Neal Smith, Nicole Altman, Anne Drolet, and myself. Results We carried out the course on 5/15/2 1. The training allowed them to get hands on experience which is critical for their role out in the field. The course participants were able to obtain an official certificate of completion and disseminate the information to their home EMS groups. They are not able to formally certify ot hers in BLSO but are able to teach employees about what they learned. We held a survey at the end of the course to identify further training needs within our EMS community which will allow our partnership to continue . Conclusion It is critical for our eme rgency medical personnel to feel comfortable and adequately prepared for the challenges that lie in the field. We were able to directly provide training in an area that they felt was a weakness. We will be able to use the results of the survey to continue aiding our EMS colleagues with education they desire , whether that be another BLSO course or other case -based training. Incoming residents can continue this project by reaching out to surrounding EMS communities or Belleville based on survey results. Acknowledgements A special thank you to Neal Smith for helping me with this project. It was his discussion with Ann Evensen that spurred our pivot to BLSO which ultimately was the best move for this experience. This would not have been possible without Ann Evensen or Lee D resang who are Family Medicine faculty at our program. Jillian Landeck also provided guidance and assistance throughout the process. Thank you to all our BLSO instructors: Danielle Hartwig, Lashika Yogendran, Nicole Altman, Andrea Suarez, MD Projects Completed During Residency: Community Health Learning Experience: Scholarly Project: Andrea grew up in Lima, Peru. She earned her undergraduate degree in biology from Hamline University before attending the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. Andrea has participated in multiple global health electives in China, Brazil and Peru throughout medical school and residency. She was also involved with the Latino Medical Student Association and volunteered at student-run free clinics while in medical school. Andrea has led events to raise awareness of health issues that disproportionately affect underrepresented communities as well as worked to recruit more diverse clinicians to the health professions. She wants to partner with patients and communities to decrease health disparities. When she is not caring for patients, Andrea enjoys live music, outdoor activities and, most importantly, seeing her 2 year-old explore the world.Partnership with the School Age Parent Program (SAPAR) What Type of Infant Formula is Best to Prevent Atopic Diseases?: Andrea co-wrote an FPIN HelpDesk Answer with Dr. Jonas Lee that has been submitted to Evidence- Based Practice for publication. They performed a literature review to answer whether there is a specific type of formula that is best to prevent atopic diseases. Multiple systematic reviews and RCTs were reviewed and there is no consistent evidence that the use of either partially or exclusively hydrolyzed formula with or without prebiotics can prevent atopic disease in infants and children at high-risk for allergic disease. Thank you to my residency family: your encouragement, teachings, and support has been paramount and I could not have done it without all of you. Thank you to my co-residents and friends for your flexibility, support and all the good times! To Dr. Tellez- Giron, my mentor since day 1 in medical school through residency and beyond, I am truly blessed and I can't imagine being here without your guidance, support and trust. To Dr. Beth Potter, I will always remember your kindness, good spirit and smile. To my Wingra family, what a great place to learn and grow as a doctor! To my husband Thadeu and daughter Sophia, your love, support and all the happiness you bring to my life, what a precious treasure and I can't thank you enough. Para mis papas y mi familia, la distancia, gracias por tanto amor. Partnership with the School Age Parent Program (SAPAR) Andrea Suarez, MD Background For the last two years, I have conducted interactive educational sessions at the School Age Parent Program (SAPAR) for pregnant and parenting students in the Madison Metropolitan School District. SAPAR provides prenatal care, childbirth and parenting skills to middle and high school students. Objectives 1. Develop interactive e ducational sessions on pregnancy and parenting topics 2. Create a safe space to share experiences and ask questions openly 3. Continue a long -standing partnership with SAPAR Methods During my first year with SAPAR, I was able to teach in-person sessions about once monthly during the school year. I strived to have interactive sessions with open- ended questions that encouraged students to voice their thoughts and concerns. Before each session, I contacted the program coordinator who provided me wit h the topics that students were interested in discussing. Lessons included multiple topics such as common complaints of pregnancy, expectations and decision-making related to delivery, contraception, STDs, child abuse, postpartum depression, mental health , care of newborn s, vaccinations, early childhood growth and development, and preparing for a well child appointment among others. At the beginning of the pandemic with virtual classes, I along with other two residents, were able to join the staff and stude nts online and continue d to address diverse topics. I also recorded multiple presentations on mental health, prenatal care and childcare and information on COVID -19. The staff at SAPAR chose when to show these videos based on their educational curriculum. Results Students at the SAPAR were very welcoming and participated actively in our sessions. Students were comfortable asking questions and discussing openly their concerns and doubts. In- person sessions had a better attendance r ate with about 3 -6 students per class. Video sessions had less attendance, but we coordinated with the SAPAR staff with handouts and resources after each session so that it can be available for the students who were not in attendance. Conclusions My partnership with SAPAR was a great way to connect with students. I was able to teach about pregnancy, parenting, women's health and child health by developing interactive sessions. I strived to create a safe non -judgmental environment where everyone could voice their concerns and doubts. Acknowledgments Thank you to the students in SAPAR for their welcoming environment. Thank you to Jessie Loeb and all the SAPAR staff for their partnership. Thank you to Dr. Lee Dresang for all the mentorship and support. Thank you to Dr. Paula Gol dman, who initially connected me with the program. Thank you to my husband Thadeu and daughter Sophia for their unconditional support and kindness. Alexandra Wolf, DO Projects Completed During Residency: Scholarly Project & Community Health Learning Experience: Alexandra (Allie) Wolf is a native Wisconsinite from Green Bay. For Allie, medicine is about taking care of more than just the patient in front of her; it is about the person's family and communities, which is why she focuses on multigenerational patient- centered care. Allie earned her bachelor's degree in biomedical sciences from Marquette University. Before starting medical school, Allie worked at a medical scribe company where she joined the Board of Directors and helped set up new scribe programs across the nation. Allie attended the A.T. Still University Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine. She served as president of the school's chapter of the Student Osteopathic Medical Association, where she expanded leadership opportunities on the board and helped raise nearly $10,000 for St. Baldrick's to benefit child cancer research. Allie was also involved in the Diversity Club and coordinated the first annual Cultural Diffusion Show. Allie is interested in providing full-spectrum family medicine including clinic, hospitalist and obstetrics with OMT, in rural, underserved communities. Allie can often be found singing, canoeing, hiking, cheering on the Green Bay Packers, playing with Taco, her Chihuahua mix, or enjoying her newborn Nya with husband Alex.Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Microlearnings Pilot: A Feasibility Study: Early in residency, Allie voiced an interest in participating in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts and took on a UW Health initiative involving a modular toolkit called \"Microlearning.\" She completed her Community Health experience as a facilitator at the Belleville residency clinic and overall project evaluator. The Microlearnings were deployed at 4 clinical sites within the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health. The usability of the Microlearnings was evaluated and presented as a \"Scholarly Discussion Presentation\" at the 2021 Annual Spring Conference for the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine. My deepest thanks goes to my husband, Alex, who has supported me through the highs and lows of medical training. I would not have survived without his unwavering encouragement, humor, and incomparable cooking; and I truly mean \"survived\" because I doubt I would have eaten, at least well. And we made a beautiful baby in the midst of a pandemic and busy resident life! I also have to thank my dog, Taco, as silly as it sounds, yet I could not imagine fulfillment without his comforting cuddles and sassy personality. Of course I would not be here without my parents, Sue and Todd, and brother, Joey, who have held me up from day one with constant love. Finally, I thank my co-residents, faculty, and DFMCH staff who are a part of my forever family!

Insert your desired text here. Do I have to facilitate these since I'm the manager/leader?How should I handle pushback from staff around engaging in these?How will this impact my work?We have so much to do already. Why spend time on this? To improve our work around DEI and this requires intentional and embedded learning. By infusing microlearnings into your daily practice, you are supporting yourself and colleagues to embed equity and increase inclusion.This tool encourages the expected and necessary learning and unlearning we must all do in order to move towards our vision of dism antling racism in ourselves, in our system, and in our community.Normalize discomfort. This is expected when engaging in DEI. The goal is not for people to be on the same page, but to create space to have conversations around DEI in order to move this work forward.Absolutely not! You can open it up to employees who would like to grow facilitation skills. We will also be offering a facilitator training that you or employees in your department may participate in.

And it's really important to be having more everyday conversations with folks and to be able to watch a video and not have a big article to read I think was a really great format.\" 16 Facilitation Experience & Support Difficult conversations \"I can see how it might be more challenging for a facilitator who did not have that background, since some of the conversations are difficult to navigate .\" \"This is back to why maybe more training or something is important. Because when a meeting like that goes poorly, you're causing harm .\" 17 Group Dynamic & Interpersonal Relationships Participants all knew each other prior to Microlearnings Microlearnings strengthened group dynamic at sites with diverse groups and sites with non-diverse groups \"It has made the group stronger, and has built trust. And kind of making the group more willing to be vulnerable in all kinds of things, not just in that space.\" 18Commitment: Personal and Institutional Facilitators mentioned the importance of facilitator and institutional commitment \"What would it look like if we heard from [our department chair] that going to [a] Microlearning meeting is part of your job ? ... It needs institutional backing . 19 Time Constraints It takes more time . It is billed at 15 minutes, and it's not 15 minute conversations. I think people in the [group] always seem to be looking forward to them, although sometimes we haven't done them because we don't have time on the agenda .\" 20 Customization Each pilot site tailored Microlearnings to their own setting Examples of how facilitators customized: Adding relevant data Altering for relevant context (non-clinical setting) Leading Microlearnings as stand-alone meeting Including two Microlearning modules in one sitting Selecting modules out of order21 COVID-19 Impact Two groups struggled to continue with Microlearnings because of COVID and two groups c ontinued Microlearnings \"Prior to the pandemic, it would be an hour and a half meeting.
