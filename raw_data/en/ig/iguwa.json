Each member is bestowed a [marking](/wiki/Mark_of_the_Guard)upon their shoulder in the shape of a roaring male lion's head. The mark may differ in color, seemingly depending on the fur, skin, or feather color of the animal with the mark. Interestingly, if a member of the guard passes their role on the team to someone else their mark will disappear when the leader gives the new member the role. While usually most Lion Guard leaders only choose four members to join the guard, they can have additional members or old members still continue to be on the team when the leader assigns them a new role. Backstory[ ] |\"||It all started long ago. A very evil group of lions tried to take over the Pride Lands. And in doing so they nearly destroyed it. So, the good lions of the Pride Lands created a powerful, unstoppable force that could defeat the evil lions, once and for all. And it worked! But only the worthiest in the Pride Lands would be allowed to find this force and use it.||\"|[Askari](/wiki/Askari), who created the Lion Guard himself as a way to combat a great evil. Generations later, [Scar](/wiki/Scar) led the Lion Guard before Kion, but he was irresponsible with his duties, corrupted his purpose and abused his powers, using the Roar of the Elders to destroy the other members of the Guard, which resulted in him completely losing the power of the roar forever. However, very little has been revealed of past Lion Guards. Kion's Lion Guard is the only Guard in history with only one lion. Vitani is the first known leader of the Lion Guard not of royal blood, and is the sister-in-law of Princess [Kiara](/wiki/Kiara). [Paintings and Predictions](/wiki/Paintings_and_Predictions), [Rafiki](/wiki/Rafiki)shows a painting of [Nala's Father](/wiki/Nala%27s_Father)being saved by the Lion Guard of his time after he fell from a tree. In [The Ancient Outpost](/wiki/The_Ancient_Outpost), Rafiki reveals that the past Lion Guards used an old shelter as a lookout point for observing the Pride Lands. In [The Ukumbusho Tradition](/wiki/The_Ukumbusho_Tradition), it is revealed that a male lion named Askari was the leader of the first Lion Guard and made peace between the lions and the elephants of the [Pride Lands](/wiki/Pride_Lands). In [The River of Patience](/wiki/The_River_of_Patience), [Roar](/wiki/Roar_of_the_Elders) Later - in [Triumph of the Roar](/wiki/Triumph_of_the_Roar) - Makini tells the Night Pride that Askari would practice there until he learned everything it could do. In [Return to the Pride Lands](/wiki/Return_to_the_Pride_Lands), [Vitani](/wiki/Vitani) is made leader of an all lioness Lion Guard. History[ ] When [The Lion [Chungu](/wiki/Chungu)threaten to kill [Bunga](/wiki/Bunga), Kion steps in, roaring so loudly that the hyenas drop Bunga, who climbs to safety. [Rafiki](/wiki/Rafiki)and [Simba](/wiki/Simba)overhear [Kion's roar](/wiki/Roar_of_the_Elders), and the two come to realize that it is time for him to lead the Lion Guard. When Bunga and Kion return to [Pride Rock](/wiki/Pride_Rock), Rafiki leads them to [The Lair of the Lion Guard](/wiki/The_Lair_of_the_Lion_Guard), where he explains that Scar used to lead the Lion Guard until he lost his powers. Simba then tasks Kion with gathering a new Lion Guard to protect the Pride Lands. Bunga and Kion set out right away, and Kion asks the honey badger if he will join the team. Bunga accepts, and his adopted uncles, [Timon](/wiki/Timon)and [Pumbaa](/wiki/Pumbaa), offer him enthusiastic congratulations. Unbeknownst to the friends, they are being spied on by [Mzingo](/wiki/Mzingo), a [vulture](/wiki/Vultures)minion of Janja's, who reports back to his leader about the newly formed Guard. When Janja hears the news, he announces to [the clan](/wiki/Janja%27s_Clan)that they [will strike that very night](/wiki/Tonight_We_Strike). On the other side of the savanna, Kion has appointed [Beshte](/wiki/Beshte), [Fuli](/wiki/Fuli), and [Ono](/wiki/Ono)to positions on the Guard. He gathers the team together and attempts to show them his Roar, but all that comes out is a squeak. Just then, Simba arrives and reacts in horror to Kion's choice of teammates. He insists that the Guard must be made of lions and then berates Kion for treating his role as a leader like a game. Wanting to be alone, Kion isolates himself from his friends, where he encounters the ghost of his grandfather [Mufasa](/wiki/Mufasa). The wise king tells Kion to trust his instincts and promises that he will always be there to guide him. No sooner has he faded from the sky when Kion hears Bunga calling for him, shouting that the hyenas are attacking a herd of [gazelles](/wiki/Gazelles). With no time to lose, Kion assembles the Lion Guard, using his paw to gift them each with a special shoulder marking. Together, the five friends attack the [hyenas](/wiki/Hyenas), driving them back into the [Outlands](/wiki/Outlands). Kion finishes the fight with the powerful Roar of the Elders, and even Janja flees in terror. Simba, [Nala](/wiki/Nala), and Rafiki watch from a nearby ridge and realizes that his son was wise to have chosen who he chose. He congratulates his son on the victory and accepts this new, brilliant assembling of loyal animals. The Lion Guard becomes separated when Kion is swept into the [Never Judge a Hyena by Its Spots](/wiki/Never_Judge_a_Hyena_by_Its_Spots)[ ] [Outlands](/wiki/Outlands). With the help of [Mbeya](/wiki/Mbeya)the [rhino](/wiki/Rhinoceros)and [Jasiri](/wiki/Jasiri)the [hyena](/wiki/Hyenas), the Guard is able to reunite with their leader at [Flat Ridge Rock](/wiki/Flat_Ridge_Rock), with Kion learning along the way that he and Jasiri are not as different as he initially believed. Though they are at first distrustful of the hyena, Kion convinces them that not all hyenas are bad. [The Rise of Makuu](/wiki/The_Rise_of_Makuu)[ ] When a new [crocodile](/wiki/Crocodiles) leader, [Makuu](/wiki/Makuu), begins to cause trouble in the Pride Lands, the Lion Guard uses a demonstration of the Roar of the Elders to show Makuu what he's up against if he chooses to fight them. The bravest member of the Guard, Bunga, begins giving bad advice to [Bunga the Wise](/wiki/Bunga_the_Wise)[ ] [Pridelanders](/wiki/Pridelanders). The rest of [the Lion Guard](/wiki/The_Lion_Guard)helps the animals he administered the bad advice to. They later protect the Pridelanders from the flooding waters of [Lake Kaziwa](/wiki/Lake_Kaziwa). [Can't Wait to be Queen](/wiki/Can%27t_Wait_to_be_Queen)[ ] When [Kiara](/wiki/Kiara) becomes acting queen of the Pride Lands, she asks the Guard divert the eland away from the bees nest but Kion believes that they should divert the bees instead it backfires, and the Lion Guard ends up colliding with the eland herd and badly stung by the bees. Then later she agrees to meet Janja in the Outlands for a \"peace meeting\". The Lion Guard saves her from the attacking hyenas after the meeting turns out to be a trap. Ono, the keenest of sight in the Guard, temporarily loses the sight from one of his eyes. Despite his injury, he goes to help the rest of the Lion Guard stop Janja from attacking the zebras. In the end [Eye of the Beholder](/wiki/Eye_of_the_Beholder)[ ] [Rafiki](/wiki/Rafiki)completes his painting of the Guard, and they all admire it. [The Kupatana Celebration](/wiki/The_Kupatana_Celebration)[ ] Kion accidentally allows a family of [jackals](/wiki/Jackals) at [Kupatana](/wiki/Kupatana). The Lion Guard drives these attackers away so that the Pridelanders can celebrate Kupatana. The Lion Guard begins to question how good of friends they are to their fastest member, Fuli. They make an effort to include her more, but end up failing to please her. They eventually rescue her and Bunga from the Outlands, and she says that while she prefers to hunt alone, she considers them her family. They then get together in a big group hug. [Fuli's New Family](/wiki/Fuli%27s_New_Family)[ ] [The Search for Utamu](/wiki/The_Search_for_Utamu)[ ] Fuli overexerts herself when she tries to use her speed too much, leaving her as easy prey for [Mzingo's parliment](/wiki/Mzingo%27s_Parliament). The Lion Guard drives the vultures away from their friend. [Follow That Hippo!](/wiki/Follow_That_Hippo!)[ ] After mistaking some small animals as being hyenas, Beshte invites [Mtoto](/wiki/Mtoto) back to train with the Guard. He doesn't do so well, but Beshte [encourages him](/wiki/Hero_Inside) to keep trying. A little bit later, the hyenas are lurking in the Pride Lands, and the Lion Guard is on the lookout. When they chase Beshte and his little [elephant](/wiki/Elephants) friend Mtoto down a river, the Lion Guard arrives in time to stop them. [The Call of the Drongo](/wiki/The_Call_of_the_Drongo)[ ] The Lion Guard is called by some animals who believe they have heard Janja, Makuu, and [Goigoi](/wiki/Goigoi) in the vicinity. They soon learn that it was just a [drongo](/wiki/Drongos) bird named [Tamaa](/wiki/Tamaa) imitating their voices, and Kion orders him to stop. However, Tamaa is kidnapped by Janja's Clan, and forced to use it again, this time impersonating the Guard. The Guard soon hear about this, and venture to the Outlands to ward of Janja's Clan and free the impalas that had been lured there. They return to the Pride Lands, and Tamaa agrees not to use his voice for anything other than helping others in the future. [Paintings and Predictions](/wiki/Paintings_and_Predictions)[ ] The Lion Guard comes to the rescue of a young gazelle with his hoof stuck under a rock. They save him successfully and retire to the Lair. Later, they are alerted to a herd of stampeding zebras and manage to save them from a rock that is about to fall on them. Having seen one of Rafiki's paintings depicting the same sequence of events, Bunga believes that the paintings tell the future. Upon seeing a painting of Kion falling from a tree, Bunga becomes concerned for his friend. However, Kion doesn't believe him, and the Guard soon must go to help the zebras again, as they are being attacked by the hyenas. They successfully drive the hyenas out of the Pride Lands, but three zebras are missing. The Guard travels to [Maji Baridi Falls](/wiki/Maji_Baridi_Falls) to find the zebras, and along the way, Bunga enlists the rest of the Guard to help him protect Kion. When the Guard reaches the zebras, a rolling boulder causes the zebras to [panic and run](/wiki/Panic_and_Run) into a river, headed straight for the [Falls](/wiki/Hakuna_Matata_Falls). However, Kion is able to use his roar to save them. The group returns to their lair, where Rafiki reveals that his paintings tell the past, not the future. The Lion Guard is tasked with guiding [The They the animals along during the song [Trail to Hope](/wiki/Trail_to_Hope), but later on, there is trouble when the zebras start to stampede. The [gazelles](/wiki/Gazelles)follow them, and the Lion Guard tries to stop the running animals. Before they are successful, large rocks fall and block the path the Mbali Fields. Ono scouts out a new path, but it cuts through the [Outlands](/wiki/Outlands). Kion is unhappy about this development but accepts it. Shortly after, a storm begins, which leads to a flash flood. The Guard works together to help the [zebras](/wiki/Zebras)and gazelles to safety. However, shortly after the animals begin making derogatory remarks about Kion's leadership. After receiving advice from [Mufasa](/wiki/Mufasa), Kion talks to the herds and receives support from [Muhimu](/wiki/Muhimu). They enter the Outlands, but before they arrive at Mbali Fields, Muhimu announces she is having a baby. The Guard splits up, with [Ono](/wiki/Ono), [Beshte](/wiki/Beshte), and [Fuli](/wiki/Fuli)leading the herds to Mbali Fields [Bunga](/wiki/Bunga)stay with Muhimu, [Swala](/wiki/Swala), and some other zebras and gazelles. Soon, Muhimu gives birth, to the awe of Kion and Bunga. However, [Janja](/wiki/Janja), [Cheezi](/wiki/Cheezi), and [Chungu](/wiki/Chungu)hear [Muhimu's son](/wiki/Hamu)neighing and attack. The Lion Guard, with some help from the herd animals, fight them off. They catch up to the others at Mbali Fields, and Ono declares that the migration was a success. The Lion Guard helps out a group of [Bunga and the King](/wiki/Bunga_and_the_King)[ ] [sable antelopes](/wiki/Sable_Antelopes)who are stuck in the mud near [Chekundu Cliffs](/wiki/Chekundu_Cliffs). As they work, they hear a loud crash, and Ono reports that Simba fell into a sinkhole. He and Kion go to check things out, and once the rest of the Guard is finished freeing the antelopes, they go after their friends, and Bunga dives into the sinkhole. The Guard first attempts to rescue Simba and Bunga by pushing a log into the sinkhole for the pair of them to use to climb out. However, the log shatters upon hitting the ground, and the plan fails, so the Lion Guard arranges to meet up with Simba and Bunga in [Nandembo Caverns](/wiki/Nandembo_Caverns). This plan is successful, and Simba and the Guard join [Nala](/wiki/Nala) and [Kiara](/wiki/Kiara), who are attending a concert performed by [Ma Tembo's Herd](/wiki/Ma_Tembo%27s_Herd). Though they are too late to hear the elephants' songs, they perform \" [Hakuna Matata](/wiki/Hakuna_Matata)\" for the herd. The Lion Guard practice their tracking skills with a game of hide-and-seek, but the game gets cut short when Fuli notices some [The Imaginary Okapi](/wiki/The_Imaginary_Okapi)[ ] [leopard](/wiki/Leopards)tracks. The Lion Guard (minus Beshte) find the leopard, named [Makucha](/wiki/Makucha), but he manages to escape. The Lion Guard soon discover that [Beshte's new friend](/wiki/Ajabu)(which Bunga and Ono believe to be imaginary) is actually an [okapi](/wiki/Okapis)named [Ajabu](/wiki/Ajabu). The Lion Guard vow to keep Beshte's new friend safe, and do so by eventually scaring Makucha away. Afterward, they bring Ajabu to Simba and Nala, where he is granted their blessing to stay in the Pride Lands. The Lion Guard is on a night patrol when [Too Many Termites](/wiki/Too_Many_Termites)[ ] [Muhanga](/wiki/Muhanga)and [Muhangus](/wiki/Muhangus)call them over to deal with some hyenas. After Kion uses his roar to throw them out of the Pride Lands, it is later revealed that Kion actually sent the [aardwolves](/wiki/Aardwolves)away by mistake. When they rush to the aid of the [Mekundu Bats](/wiki/Mekundu_Bats), who are sleeping in a falling tree, they realize that there are too many [termites](/wiki/Termites)in the Pride Lands. The Lion Guard travel to the Outlands, where [the pack of aardwolves](/wiki/Mjomba%27s_Pack)flees from them in fear. They soon notice one aardwolf, [Mjomba](/wiki/Mjomba), running towards the edge of a cliff and Bunga manages to save him. They explain that it was a mistake, and manage to persuade Mjomba over by mentioning a termite problem that has taken over the Pride Lands. They find the rest of the aardwolves in a den, and Kion asks Mjomba to enter and persuade the rest of the aardwolves to return home. Inside, Reirei and Goigoi are planning to eat the pack, and seal up the den with a large boulder when Mjomba enters and the aardwolves are ready to go home. Beshte knocks down the boulder and the Guard are able to seal Reirei and Goigoi back in their own den next door, before leading the aardwolves home. Back home, the Lion Guard attempt to cheer up an upset Bunga. It only succeeds when Ono arrives to dump off a selection of termites which were a thank you gift from the aardwolves. The Lion Guard is called to the [The Trouble With Galagos](/wiki/The_Trouble_With_Galagos)[ ] [galago](/wiki/Galagos)' tree after helping out a [giraffe](/wiki/Giraffes)named [Shingo](/wiki/Shingo), where a leopard named [Badili](/wiki/Badili)is sleeping. They force him back to his home in [Mirihi Forest](/wiki/Mirihi_Forest)situated in the [Back Lands](/wiki/Back_Lands), only to discover that he was bullied out of his home. They stand up for him and the offending leopard, [Mapigano](/wiki/Mapigano), flees, leaving Badili alone. They continue their patrol but are soon informed of Badili's return. He explains that Mapigano came back and kicked him out again, and this time the Lion Guard decide to teach Badili to [stand up for himself](/wiki/Find_Your_Roar). After some extensive training, Badili returns to the tree with the Lion Guard watching nearby. Although he falters, Badili ultimately scares Mapigano away. He expresses his gratitude to the Lion Guard, who are able to return home. The Lion Guard is patrolling the Pride Lands after a rainstorm in order to make sure that all of the trails are safe to use. They find some hyenas sneaking around and are quick to send them back to the Outlands. As they continue on their way, a mudslide ravages the trail they are traveling on, and Kion realizes that they must clear it. They split up, with Bunga and Ono keeping animals off of the trail as Beshte, Kion, and Fuli move the debris. The duo is mostly successful, though [Janja's New Crew](/wiki/Janja%27s_New_Crew)[ ] [Thurston](/wiki/Thurston)gets by them and falls into the mud. Soon, Ono sights two animals caught in another mudslide. The Guard saves them, only to discover them to be Cheezi and Chungu. After much talk, they allow the hyenas to stay in the Pride Lands. However, Kion soon comes to regret this when the Guard rushes to halt a stampeding antelope herd, believing the pair of them to be the cause. However, the Guard finds them sleeping peacefully. They hear Janja's voice and locate him stuck on a ledge, where he reports that the stampede was [Nne](/wiki/Nne)and [Tano](/wiki/Tano)'s fault and that they are currently going after some [Oryxes](/wiki/Oryxes). The Lion Guard arrives in time and stops the two hyenas before returning and ensuring that Janja, Cheezi, and Chungu make their way back to the Outlands. The Lion Guard is out on patrol. Ono sees Mzingo and his vultures chasing [Baboons](/wiki/Baboons)[ ] [Baby Baboon](/wiki/Baby_Baboon), and they interfere, driving the vultures away. A small rapid sweeps the little baboon into the river, so Fuli rushes by the side of the river and lifts the infant out. With the baboon safe, the only thing left to do is to return him home. The rest of the Guard catches up and finds Kiara stranded on an island with her friends. Kion resolutely resolves to save her. With the baboon safe, the only thing left to do is to return him home. Kion believes that Baby Baboon belongs to the [baboon troop](/wiki/Big_Baboon%27s_Troop)in [Nyani Grove](/wiki/Nyani_Grove)and assigns Fuli the task of getting him. She reluctantly agrees too and sets off with Baby Baboon on her back. She discovers that Baby Baboon is actually from [Mapango Cliffs](/wiki/Mapango_Cliffs), and must return him there. Back by the island, the Guard debates how to save Kiara. Kion decides to create a bridge, dismissing Bunga's suggestion to use the Roar of the Elders. Meanwhile, Fuli travels with Baby Baboon. After losing him briefly and finding him again, she sings \" [Baboons!](/wiki/Baboons!_(song))\" to express her frustration, and they continue on their way. Acting on Kion's plan, Beshte pushes a tree into the water, but it is swept away. Kiara tries her own plan, but it, too, fails, and Ono flies back to Kion to report this. As Fuli makes her journey, she must evade Mzingo's vultures along the way, as the Guard resolves on how to save the princess and her friends. By working together, they are able to build a bridge for the lionesses to cross. Eventually, Fuli reaches the Cliffs. However, the vultures attack and Fuli must fend them off with [Baby Baboon's Troop](/wiki/Baby_Baboon%27s_Troop). She defeats Mzingo and orders his vultures away. He complies, and the troop gathers gratefully around Fuli. She returns to her friends, who are amused by the length of her adventure. The Lion Guard and a group of young animals listen to a story about a creature known as [Beware the Zimwi](/wiki/Beware_the_Zimwi)[ ] [The Zimwi](/wiki/The_Zimwi)being told by Rafiki. When Beshte starts bellowing, his actions frighten the young animals listening to the tale, before he reveals that he is just audition. When the Lion Guard head home for the night, the group of youngsters is still frightened, and so Kion recommends they sleep together that night. Beshte suggests that they do the same thing for fun. The Guard agree, and head back to Hakuna Matata Falls. Later that night, the youngsters wake them up, claiming to have seen the Zimwi. With even Timon and Pumbaa trying to assure them that the Zimwi is a real entity, the Lion Guard scour the Pride Lands to find the so-called Zimwi, with Kion remaining adamant that the story is nothing more than a story. but as they start to believe they tale may in face be true, they wind up finding the [Porcupine Brothers](/wiki/Porcupine_Brothers)there instead, solving the mystery after a long trek. Later, Beshte auditions for [The Bellow Fellows](/wiki/The_Bellow_Fellows)and is successful, joining their ranks. Jasiri asks for Kion's help in getting her watering hole back after some lions take it over. He ventures there alone, leaving Bunga to tell the rest of the Guard his whereabouts. After meeting [Lions of the Outlands](/wiki/Lions_of_the_Outlands)[ ] [Jasiri's Clan](/wiki/Jasiri%27s_Clan), her children, [Vitani](/wiki/Vitani), [Nuka](/wiki/Nuka), and [Kovu](/wiki/Kovu), but it soon becomes apparent that Zira is not quite as hospitable as she first seems when the pair [have a disagreement over how lions should rule the land](/wiki/Lions_Over_All). She lures Kion to a dead end, and traps him in the area with other lionesses, trying to force Kion into siding with her. The rest of the Guard watch Ono try to race Fuli, but when Fuli wins multiple times, he gives in. Rafiki asks where Kion is, and Bunga finally remembers to tell them where he is. This worries Rafiki, who explains that the lions that he is supposed to be visiting are the [Outsiders](/wiki/Outsiders), a group of lionesses banished from the Pride Lands before any of them were born. They head out to save Kion. They arrive just in time, and, along with Jasiri, quickly defend Kion from the lionesses. When Kion is hesitant to use the Roar having his mind poisoned by Zira's lies, Bunga reminds him that Scar lost his Roar for using it for evil, not for using it on lions as Zira told him. He remembers and uses the Roar to blast the Outsiders far away. The Lion Guard then join Jasiri's Clan back in her true home, where she is glad to have the entire Lion Guard as her friends, as are they. The Lion Guard drive Janja's clan out of the Pride Lands. Kion congratulates his team and they make their way back. However, Ono is quick to spy Janja's clan trespassing again. Kion has his Guard surround the hyenas but finds them surrounding his mother Nala. Furiously, he uses the Roar of the Elders to send the hyenas flying back to the Outlands. However, the Roar rebounds, sending the Guard sliding about as they try to hold on. When it's over, Kion is devastated by the amount of destruction he has caused, including the loss of Ono's crest feathers. >Back in The Lair of the Lion Guard, Bunga performs \" [Never Roar Again](/wiki/Never_Roar_Again)[ ] [Stand Up, Stand Out](/wiki/Stand_Up,_Stand_Out)\" with Fuli and Beshte to convince Ono to be proud of his new difference as Kion muses over paintings of Scar killing his Guard. The group is summoned to help some giraffes whose watering hole has been blocked. Beshte is able to successfully shift the boulders. The Guard then must save a [klipspringer](/wiki/Klipspringers)who is stuck in a river. They use a log as a bridge, but it shatters under their weight, frightening the klipspringer so that it leaps safely to the other side. Their work done, Kion seeks advice from his grandfather as Bunga fashions a headdress for Ono and Fuli hears news from [Male Mongoose](/wiki/Male_Mongoose)that Makuu has taken over [The Flood Plains](/wiki/The_Flood_Plains). She relays this to Beshte, Bunga, and Ono, and Ono leaves to tell Kion as the rest take on the crocodiles. Fuli battles Makuu himself as Beshte and Bunga handle the rest, but they end up surrounded in the water. Kion arrives with Nala, who is pulled into the water by two crocodiles. Kion almost uses the Roar out of anger once more, but instead trusts himself and finds a new way to use it, blasting the crocodiles away but leaving Nala safe. The Guard is impressed and awestruck, and Ono is pleased to discover his missing feathers have started a trend among his [Ono's flock](/wiki/Ono%27s_Flock). The Lion Guard help out [The Lost Gorillas](/wiki/The_Lost_Gorillas)[ ] [Zazu](/wiki/Zazu), who is trapped in a beehive. After helping him, he tells them that the [pangolins](/wiki/Pangolins)have been spraying. Curious, the Lion Guard locate the pangolins and find two [gorillas](/wiki/Gorillas), [Hafifu](/wiki/Hafifu)and [Majinuni](/wiki/Majinuni), messing with them. After they get them to drop the pangolins they find out that they are carrying a message for Simba. The Lion Guard escort them back to Pride Rock and it turns out that they have forgotten the all-important message, which is actually confirmation of whether or not a peace treaty still stands. The Lion Guard escort them home, even though the gorillas are reluctant to return since it will mean disappointing their father. They only admit to this once they are saved by Kion and the Guard when a [forest hog](/wiki/Forest_Hogs) [hog](/wiki/Forest_Hogs)tries to attack. When the Lion Guard reach snow they start to play, until Kion slides down the ice. The rest of the Lion Guard is unable to help him when that happens but he is saved by Hafifu and Majinuni. Once home, [King Sokwe](/wiki/King_Sokwe)forgives his children for all of their wrongdoings, since they saved Kion. He then relays the message onto the Lion Guard, who deliver it to Simba by means of a snowball thrown on his head. Simba realizes that the peace treaty is still on, and the Lion Guard laugh together as Simba shakes the snow away. While Kion takes a trip to [The Trail to Udugu](/wiki/The_Trail_to_Udugu)[ ] [Udugu](/wiki/Udugu), he leaves his father in charge of the Lion Guard. However, Simba's way is very different to Kion's, and he doesn't use each member of the Guard to their fullest when some [ostrich](/wiki/Ostriches)eggs are endangered by some mud sliding down a cliff. Although everything works out in the end, the other Lion Guard members are less than impressed with his actions. A bit later, Simba notices a herd of gazelles trying to leap up some loose rocks. Ignoring their easily startled nature, Simba runs towards them with the Lion Guard, causing them to run up the rocks. Simba rushes on ahead of the other members and his tail becomes trapped by one of the falling rocks. When more falling rocks plummet to the ground, he witnesses Fuli save Bunga thanks to Ono's keen eyes, and sees that they do things differently. The gazelles start to stampede towards the ostrich eggs and this time, Simba orders them to do things the way Kion would. They do as instructed, and Fuli and Ono save the eggs while Bunga and Beshte save Simba. He admits that Kion would be proud, as is he. Kion and his friends see all the birds in the Pridelands heading somewhere special and when they arrive on the scene the guard discovered that Ono is already there. Ono explains that all the birds are gathering because [Ono's Idol](/wiki/Ono%27s_Idol)[ ] [Hadithi](/wiki/Hadithi)the legendary [eagle](/wiki/Eagles)is returning to the Pride Lands. Later, Ono is appointed as Hadithi's partner for the day, as per the tradition following the [Royal Mud Print Ceremony](/wiki/Royal_Mud_Print_Ceremony)which is being held in Hadithi's honor. While the rest of the Guard create [The Traditional Ceremonial Nest](/wiki/The_Traditional_Ceremonial_Nest), Ono, and Hadithi tour the Pride Lands. However, Hadithi abandons Ono when Janja's clan sneak up on some klipspringers. Although Hadithi tries to go through with the ceremony, he cannot contain his guilt and leads the Lion Guard to Ono. Together, the Lion Guard defeat the hyenas (particularly thanks to Ono) and return to the Pride Lands to finish the ceremony, which is held in Ono's honor instead of Hadithi. Beshte, along with his father, help Young Rhino out of the reeds when he gets trapped due to his impatience, then as Kion and the others arrive on the scene Beshte says everything is taken care of. But, just as the hippos were getting back to work, Basi reveals that he was injured while helping Young Rhino. With no other alternative, he passes on the job of making the [Beshte and the Hippo Lanes](/wiki/Beshte_and_the_Hippo_Lanes)[ ] [Hippo Lanes](/wiki/Hippo_Lanes)to Beshte while his friends escort Basi to a place to rest. As Beshte was making the Hippo Lanes, Kion and the rest of the Guard find some complications transporting a [herd](/wiki/Bupu%27s_Herd)of sable antelopes to Flood Plains. Once they finally make it there, Ono discovers something wrong with the lanes and goes to talk to Beshte. When the hippo looks back at work he discovers the lanes aren't straight and true at all, he is greatly upset. So he tells Ono to go back to Kion and tell them not to let anyone in while Beshte talks to his father as the two hippos admit their mistakes. They make a new hippo lane that everyone can use. Meanwhile, Ono makes it to Kion saying the lanes aren't done, but it's too late as two Sable Antelopes already went in. Kion and Ono venture in after them leaving Fuli and Bunga to watch the herd. When a new and correct lane was completed and the two Sable Antelopes were found, Beshte returns to find his father. Then, Bunga tells the herd to move but they refuse. Fuli, at the end of her wits, finally apologizes and asks politely for the herd to move to which they do. With herd finally moving things are looking up, Beshte sees Makuu heading for his father and with Beshte's quick thinking, they trick the crocodiles into moving right into the path of the antelope herd. Makuu then slinks away in pain with his float. Then, the friends admire Beshte's work believing he does have a knack for making them with Basi agreeing on the compliment. Kion and the others arrive in Nyani Grove to discover it's a mess, Fuli rushes ahead to find the cause but is stopped by a group of fleeing of baboons. The reason why they were so spooked was that of a poorly sighted rhino named Kifaru that lost his tickbird. So the guard has Ono act as the rhino's temporary tickbird while Kion and the others look for Mwenzi. As Ono convinces Mwenzi to make amends with Kifaru, Makuu attacks and Ono places the tickbird up high until he comes back with help. Kifaru is the first one to arrive on the scene but thanks to the poor eyesight he charges into a tree; seeing the rhino trapped Makuu calls for his float but the guard intervenes. [Ono the Tickbird](/wiki/Ono_the_Tickbird)[ ] While the guard is fighting against Makuu's Float, Mwenzi helps Kifaru get free but with the trunk still on his horn using that Kifaru drives Makuu and his float away. The pair along with the guard make it to Tamasha happy that Mwenzi and Kifaru are back together. When the Lion Guard save Muhimu's herd from Reirei's pack the zebra ask Bunga if he could watch over her son Hamu and he agrees too. As they have fun at [Babysitter Bunga](/wiki/Babysitter_Bunga)[ ] [Hakuna Matata Falls](/wiki/Hakuna_Matata_Falls)the rest of the guard tries to practice their climbing skills with little success and Muhimu arrives at the watering hole with some of her friends. After hearing that Hamu is with Bunga; Twiga and the other mothers ask the honey badger if he could watch their young ones too and gladly accepts. While the mothers are relaxing the jackals hear from them that their kids are with Bunga and think they'll be easy pickings. As for the rest guard, they see that everything is quiet until they catch Goigoi who unveils Reirei's plan realizing that Bunga and Hamu are in danger they head for [Hakuna Matata Falls](/wiki/Hakuna_Matata_Falls). In the midst of their fun the jackals attack but thanks to the kids bravery and Bunga's quicking thinking they were able to beat the pack just as Kion and the others arrive. Muhimu and her friends return to pick up their kids, and Bunga tells them how the kids fought against the jackals. At first, they were shocked but when she was told that the kids learned how to defend themselves, she calls Bunga the best babysitter ever, and the kids gather around him for a group hug. The guard is seen playing Baobab Ball with Mtoto until the young elephant hears various animals heading towards Pride Rock for the Savannah Summit including Makuu. Believing that Makuu is coming to ruin the summit Kion leads away as everyone is at [The Savannah Summit](/wiki/The_Savannah_Summit)[ ] [Mizimu Grove](/wiki/Mizimu_Grove)the guard compliments that everything is going well and even that Makuu is behaving himself. But they are alerted by Mtoto that Makuu is causing trouble and accusing him of making a plot against the other leaders causing him to lose faith in trusting others. With Simba disappointed Kion goes to talk to his grandfather about what happened, Mufasa reminds him about jumping to conclusions too quickly. Afterward, Kion is alerted that there's another problem and Bunga assumes that it's Makuu but the lion cub tells Mtoto to listen again, all he can make out is that someone is plotting something but he doesn't know who. Piecing the information together Kion figures out that Makuu is the target and leads the guard away to save him. Once they find him the guard warns him that he's in danger, being a crocodile Makuu wasn't too worried. He falls into a pitfall trap but is quickly rescued and thanks to the guard for saving him but now came the part of finding who plotted against him. To do so, Kion falsely tells the others animals of Makuu's 'demise' and that's when Twiga and Vuruga Vuruga confessed that it was them but they didn't want to hurt him. Makuu arrives saying that he came to the summit to prove that he is a good leader and to help the Pride Lands. But all he got was distrust and a plot to take him out then, everyone begins to think that Makuu wasn't going to trust anyone but his anger turns to joy when he finds their plot worthy of a crocodile and allows the summit to continue. Simba praises his son for a good job and leaves to handle a dispute while Mtoto heads home with Bunga being glad he doesn't have ears like Mtoto's and Fuli compliments that with guard sharing a laugh. The guard is enjoying a peaceful morning on patrol but then they begin to notice several animals in a hurry including [The Traveling Baboon Show](/wiki/The_Traveling_Baboon_Show)[ ] [Ma Tembo](/wiki/Ma_Tembo). They try to ask her why she's in a hurry but she doesn't answer and the guard follows her to discover a crowd of Pride Landers waiting for [The Traveling Baboon Show (group)](/wiki/The_Traveling_Baboon_Show_(group))to perform. Everyone is impressed with their tricks except for Fuli and Ono gets tossed around by the baboons during the show. After the performance, Bunga asks Uroho if he could be apart of their next show but he says there are no openings. Anyway, Kion welcomes the troop to the Pride Lands giving them a chance to perform for his parents the King and Queen but seemingly turns down the offer. Just as they arrived the Pride Landers food mysteriously started to disappear. Through deductive reasoning, Ono figures out there's more than one food thief and soon hear of another show. That's when Bunga suggest the culprit is there and they leave to check out while Ono looks from above. But then, the egret sees that the thieves are the baboons when he tries to tell Kion the troop tosses him around until he breaks free and informs his leader. Bunga distraught that they would do such a thing and they all wonder if they did take the food where did it go; having an idea Kion asks Beshte to shake the tree revealing their trickery. With their plot revealed the troop tries to flee with the guard chasing them but their pursuit was halted by a sable antelope stampede and two of them fall into the river. Kion calls off the chase to rescue them while Ono follows the baboons after the rescue the egret informs them that they are heading for the Outlands. Later, Ono notices them being chased by Janja. Feeling guilty they decide that, since they were the reason for their 'exile', they'll save them from the hyenas. The Lion Guard track down Janja, Cheezi, and Chungu and force them away, leaving the baboons feeling indebted to them. They return to the Pride Lands, where the Traveling Baboons put on a show for the Pride Landers and hands them back their food. Fuli gets into the show too, and the baboons 'borrow' Ono again to take part in the show itself. During Morning Patrol, the Guard discovers that a harrier [Ono and the Egg](/wiki/Ono_and_the_Egg)[ ] [hawk](/wiki/Harrier_Hawks)named [Mpishi](/wiki/Mpishi)has entered the Pride Lands. After dealing with Mpishi, Ono discovers a [hammerkop](/wiki/Hamerkops)egg in his nest ad volunteers to watch over it while the others search for the egg's mother. The search for the mother bird continues until the guard notices a mudslide heading for some red rock hares and rush off to help. Meanwhile, back at Ono's nest the egg hatches and the [young chick](/wiki/Ona)tries to do the hammerkop family bonding dance until Ono corrects her but he doesn't find his job any easier with the young chick constantly getting into trouble. But the pair manages to make it safely into the tall grass and the other guard members discover that the egg belongs to [Kulinda](/wiki/Kulinda)and she put her egg in Ono's Nest until she could fix up her own. As they take Kulinda back to her chick, Mpishi comes across Mwoga and decide to work together in hunting. As Kion and the others arrive at Ono's nest they see that Kulinda's baby is gone and she begins to cry out which is heard by the chick and do their family bonding dance. But trouble arises again when the chick runs off and gets caught by Mpishi but thanks to Ono's quick thinking and Bunga's help the chick is safely returned to her mother. As thanks for Ono's hard work and bravery Kulinda decides to name her chick after him calling her Ona. Kulinda says that he is welcomed back anytime since they consider him part of the family and the three birds do their family bonding dance as the guard watches happily. The dry season is finally here and the guard is busier than ever, saving animals from rock slides, rock piles, falling branches, directing Makuu and his float to their hibernation cave and more. Then, they are alerted by Ono that hyenas are attacking Ma Tembo's Herd and once the guard arrives they see the chaos and are completely astonished that the hyenas would do something like this. So instead of using the roar Kion suggest that they flush the hyenas out of the herd and Beshte sends them flying. Afterward, Ma Tembo thanks the guard for the help but understands why the hyenas would do this - because there's less food in the Outlands especially during the dry season. Since it's the dry season, Ma Tembo's first responsibility as a leader is to find water and Kion compliments on knowing the feeling. As Ono watches over the elephants and the remaining guard members return to the lair; Kion consults to his grandfather about concerns of the Dry Season (at first unknown to him that [The Rise of Scar](/wiki/The_Lion_Guard:_The_Rise_of_Scar)[ ] [Makini](/wiki/Makini)was watching). After talking to Mufasa, Makini makes her presence known to him who is amazed at his ability. Kion tries to keep quiet about it and she tells him that she is Rafiki's new apprentice. Ono appears to inform his leader that the hyenas are back and this time they're going after the baboons who following the elephants. Once reunited with the others, Kion forms up a plan to drive the hyenas away but just before he uses the roar he notices the dark clouds behind him, calms down and sends them away. With everyone safe, the guard leaves but Kion is still disappointed that there was nothing they could do to help and goes off to his father Simba, who acknowledges his son's hardships, [comparing them to his own](/wiki/The_Path_of_Honor). Later, Rafiki takes Makini to meet the Lion Guard in their lair. She is excited to meet everyone, especially Fuli, the first ever female to join the Guard. While Kion gets the rest of the pride ready to meet Makini the young mandrill tests staff and it works. Referring to Makini's earlier question with the remaining members listening Rafiki's explains through his paintings of how the good and the bad lions of the past are summoned (unknown to them that Ushari was listening.) Afterward, she is introduced to Kion's family, before heading out with Kiara to help Ma Tembo. But when Kiara is kidnapped by Janja, Makini quickly to returns to the lair and informs the Lion Guard, who quickly make their way to the Outlands. While Kion distracts the hyenas he has the others rescue Kiara, but they see that his plan only lured Janja away, causing a change of plans. Fuli and the others manage to complete the rescue but just before the Guard leaves the hyena taunts Kion by saying that they get rid of everyone that he cares about which causes him to roar in anger making the volcano erupt but everyone manages to escape. Unknown that Kion's roar and tossing Makini's staff into the volcano makes Scar rise. Returning to Ma Tembo's search Makini uses what she learned from Rafiki about being quiet and Ma Tembo finds water and the pride landers happily drink unaware of the danger from the Outlands. [Let Sleeping Crocs Lie](/wiki/Let_Sleeping_Crocs_Lie)[ ] In the midst of trying to calm a herd of sable antelopes, the Guard accidentally wake up Makuu and his float in the cave they were sleeping in. When the crocodile leader and Kiburi make themselves known, Ono confesses it was his idea to lead the herd near the crocodile's cave. Upon hearing that, [Kiburi](/wiki/Kiburi) wants to deal with the egret 'the crocodile way' until he is stopped by Kion and Makuu. Makuu finds out it was Kiburi that defied his order, and Simba states that they have a solution to their problem; when Kiburi sees the result he becomes dissatisfied. Makuu tries to reason with him to no avail and the rebellious crocodile calls for a Mashindano.Later, Everyone watches the duel except for Ono, who flies up to get away. But thanks to his sight he notices some crocodiles leaving the event and tells the others. Understanding what's going on, the Guard quietly sneaks around the crowd to stop Kiburi's friends, including [Nduli](/wiki/Nduli)and [Tamka](/wiki/Tamka). Simba, hearing the commotion behind him, asks Kion what's going on and seeing the beaten crocodiles the king quickly figures out they were trying to ambush him and that Kiburi was behind this. Believing that his plan worked Kiburi forfeits and proudly boasts about it. But hearing everything that transpired Makuu has Kiburi and his followers banished from the float and Simba banishes them from the Pride Lands. At their new home, Ono is forgiven by Makuu for his mistake and the crocodile speaks of a new \"crocodile way\" with everyone agreeing. When Thurston's herd gets stuck in the mud, Kion uses the roar to make rain but it accidentally turns it into a flood flash. Although the herd is saved, Beshte ends up in the Outlands. As his friends try to look for him, Beshte does his best to cope with the heat but his presence doesn't go unnoticed. Shupavu and two of her friends lure the hippo into a trap that leads to the hyenas to crush him with rocks in an attempt to weaken the Guard. Beshte, completely unaware of their alliance to Scar, falls into the trap without any problem. Kion and the others arrive just in time before Janja and his friends crush Beshte with a big rock. With Ono leading the way around to [Swept Away](/wiki/Swept_Away)[ ] [Rocky Plateau](/wiki/Rocky_Plateau), the Guard are able to battle with the hyenas. As Fuli tries to steady the rock, Kion uses the Roar to send the hyenas flying. But just as they think everything is over, Bunga accidentally pushes the rock and it rolls down the cliff. At first, everyone is upset about Beshte but he shows beside the guard completely fine and they all head back to the Pride Lands, with Beshte doing a belly flop into the mud, sharing a laugh with the Guard. Thanks to the Dry Season, the Lion Guard has to deal with wildfires popping up all over the Pride Lands, meanwhile, Rafiki has problems of his own. Rafiki tells the guard of his predicament and they offer to escort the three friends to their herds but the reunions don't go so well; the friends realize they don't fit in with their herds and the friends end up back together. After that the guard meets up at Pride Rock, Ono begins to see thunderstorm clouds a distance away and leave to help any animals. Once arriving the guard warns Zito and a few hippos of the dry lighting but it causes a fire that leaves them all trapped. To make matters worse, the fire spreads to Rafiki's Tree, causing the mandrills to become trapped inside. As the guard tries to figure a way out, they discover Rafiki's Tree on fire, causing a greater urgency to clear the flames than ever before. Thanks to Beshte's strength and Kion's Roar the fire is extinguished. The Guard rush off to help Rafiki but discover \"the other Bungas\" are already there. They quickly assist them and help finish the job, thus saving Rafiki's home. He is extremely grateful and offers to let the three friends live near his tree as long as they can be quiet. But they turn down the offer, saying they found another home and accept each other as their family. All the animals come to Pride Rock to watch Makini's first painting presentation with the three friends, the royal family and the Guard having a front row seat. After the young mandrill is done everyone is amazed at her work. [Rafiki's New Neighbors](/wiki/Rafiki%27s_New_Neighbors)[ ] The Lion Guard lead a herd of buffaloes to a watering hole, with [Rescue in the Outlands](/wiki/Rescue_in_the_Outlands)[ ] [Tsetse Flies](/wiki/Tsetse_Flies)bombarding their every move until they settle in the water, causing the flies to leave. When Mbeya calls out for help, the Lion Guard quickly locate the rhino, who has received the flies instead. They assist him and walk him back to a watering hole when they bump into Thurston and his herd, whose watering hole the buffalo are now in. The flies disappear again, causing Ono to remember a strange oddity regarding the flies - they do not like zebra stripes. They offer to escort Thurston's herd as well. When they reach the watering hole, Thurston begins to tell them about how he earned his stripes, only for his stories to end when [Madoa](/wiki/Madoa)is led by Ono to the Lion Guard with some worrisome news. Janja's clan have trapped Jasiri, Tunu, and Wema in an open vent. The Lion Guard try to run but are stopped by the tsetse flies again. When Thurston approaches, Kion asks him to come with them to the Outlands and make it to the vent where Jasiri is being held. He agrees, and they enter the Outlands together. When the flies leave, the Guard try to get Thurston to leave, but he accidentally follows them whilst Madoa hides under Kion's order. The Lion Guard-tackle Janja's clan and Kion quickly comes up with a plan to save Jasiri and the cubs. Once Beshte forces a large rock to fall in the vent, Jasiri and the cubs are able to rise up by standing on it. Once free, they join the rest of the Lion Guard in driving Janja's clan away. With everyone safe, Jasiri shows concerns over Janja's attack, seeing that he was really out to get her. Kion comforts her by saying that the dry season makes other animals do crazy things, and Jasiri thanks the Guard for the rescue. She and the cubs return home while the Guard and Thurston return to the Pride Lands. After Kion thanks the zebra for his bravery he mistakenly assumes he's apart of the Guard and runs off to tell his herd. Almost immediately upon his leave, the Guard is pestered with flies begging the zebras if they could hang out except for Bunga to takes pleasure in eating them. The Guard watches Ma Tembo's Herd prepare for the [The Ukumbusho Tradition](/wiki/The_Ukumbusho_Tradition)[ ] [Ukumbusho](/wiki/Ukumbusho), a celebration that brought peace between the lions and elephants during the time of the first Lion Guard led by [Askari](/wiki/Askari). With help from Timon and Pumbaa, the current Guard begins to practice their lines. Ma Tembo worries about the present day Lion Guard since they're not all lions as opposed to previous generations. Makini offers a solution - to paint the Guard as lions. They accept her offer, and Makini quickly returns to finish off the elephants. As the mandrill continues her work, she discovers that she is out of paint and leaves to find more fruit after Kion calms the elephants. But instead, she finds yellow flowers and uses them to finish painting the elephants. Night approaches and the Ukumbusho starts off without a hunch until a swarm of bees comes down, startling Ma Tembo and the herd into a stampede. The Lion Guard rushes off to calm them down, and Ono explains that elephants are afraid of bees. They deduce that the reason why the bees were attracted to the elephants is that their paint markings were made out of the pollen from the flowers Makini found. With the help of Mtoto, they manage to calm most of the herd down except for [Mtoto's Mom](/wiki/Mtoto%27s_Mom), who heads for a cliff. Bunga leaps into action and manages to soothe her. The Guard and the herd return safely to the celebration, where Kion suggests not using anymore paint on the elephants. Simba chimes in to suggest looking at it as a new tradition, and Ma Tembo agrees, and the Ukumbusho resumes. The Lion Guard discovered Janja's clan trying to steal a hoard of [The Bite of Kenge](/wiki/The_Bite_of_Kenge)[ ] [Tikiti Melons](/wiki/Tikiti_Melons)intended for the elephants during the dry season. They chase them away and decide to keep an eye out for them in case they return. Suddenly, the Guard hear a commotion at a nearby watering hole and come across a monitor lizard named [Kenge](/wiki/Kenge), a friend of Ushari's who are working with Janja's clan to steal the melons. Kion, Fuli, and Beshte get bitten and become paralyzed by his poison, but Bunga uses his stink to scare the lizard away. Ono informs his fallen friends that Kenge is a [monitor lizard](/wiki/Monitor_Lizards)and that his bite can cause paralysis, but only temporarily. Kion asks Ono to check with Rafiki to see if he has a cure for the poison. Once Ono makes it to Rafiki's tree he discovers from Makini that he's gone for the day. She agrees to step in for him and makes her way to the injured group. She explains that she needs [Ponya Flowers](/wiki/Ponya_Flowers), and Ono spots them easily. But he also spots the hyenas and the monitor lizard again. Kion asks Ono and Bunga to take care of it, and they do so. The duo arrives to stop Kenge and the hyenas once again, but they manage to escape with the melons, and not before Ono and Bunga get bitten too. However, similar to Ushari's bite, the honey badger is immune to Kenge's venom as well. Meanwhile, Makini tries to heal Kion and the others, unsure if they were supposed to eat, smell, or wear them, so she has them do all three (even the carnivores). Bunga returns with a paralyzed Ono and informs the others what has happened. Seeing that Kenge, Janja, Cheezi, Bunga and Makini to venture there, using a plan. When they arrive, Bunga works to distract the hyenas and Kenge whilst Makini moves the melons to a safe place. He uses Kenge's anger against him by taunting him continuously. Using this, he is able to trick Kenge into biting Janja, Cheezi, and Chungu with ease, paralyzing the trio. Bunga and Makini manage to keep them occupied long enough for Kion and the others to arrive and the cub uses the Roar to send their enemies back to the Outlands. With that, the Guard and Makini escort the melons back to the Pride Lands and share a laugh. As Rafiki explains all of the Pride Lands traditions to Makini, she spots a painting of Timon with a [Timon and Pumbaa's Christmas](/wiki/Timon_and_Pumbaa%27s_Christmas)[ ] [Christmas Tree](/wiki/Christmas_Tree), with the Lion Guard and other animals underneath it. Being new to the Pride Lands Rafiki tells her the story of how the holiday was introduced. The scene changes to Bunga and his uncles decorating a tree for [Christmas](/wiki/Christmas), until Timon falls from a branch and is caught by Beshte. The honey badger tells the others about the holiday and they also hear of Timon's greatest wish, to see Dandy Claws, who only appears when the song \" [The Twelve Ways of Christmas](/wiki/The_Twelve_Ways_of_Christmas)\" is performed on Christmas morning with all twelve animals present. When Bunga tells his friends his desire to make his uncles' wish come true, the Guard travels all over the Pride Lands, gathering all the animals together. Once they start practicing, they continue all the way up to early morning. With everyone exhausted and with Bunga still not sure that they're ready, they begin to leave until they are halted by Kion. Simba asks Bunga why he is making such an effort, and he replies that he wants to tell his uncles thank you for all they have done. Simba believes this to be a good reason, so they all resume practicing. When morning comes, Bunga drags his uncles to the Christmas tree, and the performance begins. It is a success, although [Dandy Claws](/wiki/Dandy_Claws)does not show up, much to Bunga's disappointment. But Pumbaa comes dressed up as ' [Dandy Claws](/wiki/Dandy_Claws)' instead, though remembers that he forgot to get Timon a gift since he spent so long getting the costume together. The meerkat says that he doesn't care about getting gifts, and that being among friends is the greatest gift of all (whilst also mentioning that they got gifts from the performance). The Lion Guard decide to continue the Christmas tradition, and the Pride Landers wish each other a Merry Christmas. [The Morning Report](/wiki/The_Morning_Report)[ ] The Guard finds [Bupu](/wiki/Bupu) stuck in a tree where a [yellow wagtail](/wiki/Yellow_Wagtails) named [Nyuni](/wiki/Nyuni) is nesting. Zazu arrives and promptly decides to include the sable antelope's situation into his [Morning Report](/wiki/Morning_Report). Kion suddenly has an idea, and the entire branch is broken off. Bupu leads his herd away, and Zazu congratulates Kion on his idea before leaving to see what else is happening in the Pride Lands. Fuli notes that the hornbill likes butting into everybody's business. However, Kion doesn't take it too personally, reminding her that Zazu watches over everyone, and recounts the time when he saved the cub and Bunga from Makuu's float back when Pua was still in charge. Later, Simba and the Guard notice that Zazu is late for the Morning Report and, knowing how timely the hornbill is, the Guard searches for him right away. In their search for him, the Guard discovers that Zazu was captured by the hyenas and they head off to the Outlands. Hearing the hornbill's singing leads them just outside the Outland's Volcano, and they begin to fight Janja's clan. During the battle, Zazu sees Fuli getting pushed back to the edge with lava below. Having no choice, he rolls his cage towards the hyenas giving the cheetah enough time to move away from the edge. But Zazu heads for the lava himself, and Fuli is not able to catch him in time as he rolls down a steep slope. Kion notices this and uses the roar to make a safe spot for him so that he can fly to safety. With Zazu safe they all head back to the Pride Lands where the hornbill gives his Morning Report, despite it being night time. During a water shortage in Pride Lands, Simba sends the Lion Guard to the Back Lands to talk with Dhababu. Once there they come across Makucha who allows them to pass but leave quickly and upon meeting Dhababu, a golden zebra, she agrees to share the watering hole if the guard can bring them a Tamboa plant. But once they do Dhababu terminates the deal much to the guard's confusion and soon denies her herd's access to the watering hole. They soon realize this is because the watering hole is empty, causing the herd to abandon their leader. The guard convinces Dhahabu to try and find out what caused the water to disappear and as they soon discover what caused the problem, a rockslide. Soon they come across Makucha again who refuses to share the watering hole and commands his leap to attack the guard. The group defeat the leap, but Makucha goes after Dhahabu who was hiding. With the help of Kion's words the golden zebra is able to kick Makucha into the rocks that were blocking the water flow, restoring it at last. The guard then lead the thirsty Pridelanders to the watering hole, where they all finally get a drink, and the guard has fun playing in the water. [The Golden Zebra](/wiki/The_Golden_Zebra)[ ] While on patrol, the Guard believes that the crocodiles are fighting and rush off to help but [The Little Guy](/wiki/The_Little_Guy)[ ] [Hodari](/wiki/Hodari)informs them that they interrupted a training session, which is confirmed by Ono. Seeing Hodari move like a crocodile, the gecko admits to Beshte that he wants to become a crocodile or at least an honorary one. Then a herd of buffaloes runs by, Fuli and Ono try to calm the herd while the others help Makuu's float get to safety in the process Makuu gets hurt but is still alright and they leave. Asking Beshte for help Hodari, the hippo introduces the gecko to the crocodiles asking if he could be apart of the float but gets rejected. As the guard deals with [Laini](/wiki/Laini) and two of her friends being stuck in a tree; Hodari is accepted in Kiburi's float. Then, they see Kiburi enter the Pride Lands with their newest member as the guard warns him away Beshte tries to warn Hodari that Kiburi can't trust due to his misdeeds believing that the hippo wants him to give up his dreams the gecko says they're no longer friends and leaves. But return to help when Kiburi's float attacks Makuu's Float, seeing Kiburi's disrespect for 'the crocodile way' and his true colors Hodari intervenes to set things right by helping Makuu defeat Kiburi. After the crocodiles are beaten, Kion uses the roar to send Kiburi's float home, and Hodari is given a membership to Makuu's float as an honorary crocodile. Having Reirei and her jackal pack join their ranks as a test, Scar orders them to go to the Pride Lands to see how the Lion Guard reacts. Once back he commands that the guard acted just as he had excepted with the test complete he commands them to go after Rafiki who is able to sense the [Divide and Conquer](/wiki/Divide_and_Conquer)[ ] [Lions of the Past](/wiki/Great_Lions_of_the_Past)including Scar himself. Meanwhile - thinking about the guard - he agrees that they are at a disadvantage when they split up. So Bunga gives the idea that they should be in two places at once. So they look for Tamaa. They find him and are happy that he kept to his word and asked him for help once the hyenas and jackals return the guard puts their plan into action. With Tamaa distracting the jackals, Kion and the others take off after the hyenas during the chase they discover that Janja and his clan are after Rafiki. The clans find him meditating on a rock once they surround him the mandril manages to fight them off until the guard arrives. Meanwhile, Reirei discovers they've been tricked and rejoin the hyenas. So [Tamaa](/wiki/Tamaa) leaves to warn Kion after Janja tries to retreat Kion follows until Scar intervenes. With Tamaa and [Rafiki](/wiki/Rafiki), they were able to drive the hyenas and jackals away. But after the fight, they all notice a strange burn mark on the ground. The mandril recognizes the image as a sign of great evil. So he leaves to consult the paintings in the lair in hopes that the shape is a coincidence. Now having the vultures in his rank, Scar has another plan to get rid of Simba this time with the help of a scorpion named Sumu. Meanwhile, the Pride Landers are at Pride Rock celebrating the [The Scorpion's Sting](/wiki/The_Scorpion%27s_Sting)[ ] [Kumbuka](/wiki/Kumbuka)honoring Simba's defeat over Scar but the celebration comes to a quick end when the king gets stung by the scorpion. The rest of the guard, Timon, and Pumbaa rush over to Simba's side, the guard tries to find the arachnid but Sumu escapes. Back at Pride Rock, Rafiki and Makini do their best to heal him and until the mandrill remembers volcanic ash but the only place to find it is in the Outlands Volcano. While escorting Makini there the guard face off against Reirei's Pack, Kiburi's Float and Janja's Clan until they finally make it to the volcano exhaustingly. They finally meet Scar and they all find out that the vultures, hyenas, jackles, and crocodiles are all working for him. Soon Scar calls out [his army](/wiki/Army_of_Scar)and most of their enemies start coming towards them. Kion decides to use the Roar to escape and he uses it at least 4 times. The sun starts to set the guard decides to let Fuli and Bunga go first to get the cord to Rafiki. Bunga gets to Pride rock and Simba is soon weak he falls but Pumbaa catches him and Rafiki catches the cord. Kion, Beshte, and Makini come in to check on the king and as soon as Rafiki puts the ash on him he starts to feel better. Kion explains to Rafiki how he saw Scar and needs to talk to his father about this. Rafiki tells Kion to let Simba rest for a while Kion joins the guard at the edge of Pride Rock. He claims that their job just got a lot harder and that they will defeat Scar The guard is at Pride Rock listing to Rafiki speak to Makini to find [The Wisdom of Kongwe](/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Kongwe)[ ] [Kongwe](/wiki/Kongwe). [Bunga](/wiki/Bunga)offers his own advice, but the offer is rejected. [Beshte](/wiki/Beshte)mentions knowing Kongwe and, when Makini asks if he knows where she lives, he replies with [Urembo River](/wiki/Urembo_River), a half-day walk from their current location. When Simba shows concern, [Fuli](/wiki/Fuli)steps forward to offer her assistance, confident that she can get there faster. It is accepted, and [Rafiki](/wiki/Rafiki)announces that she will escort Makini. The trainee becomes excited and starts talking, causing Fuli to go on ahead without her at first. The rest of the Lion Guard agree to go on patrol. While Fuli laments about not being able to find her faster, she stands on the [tortoise](/wiki/Tortoises)by mistake. Kongwe offers her some sage words, leading Makini to realize that this must be Kongwe. She goes on to say that the King wishes to speak with her and they begin to depart, though Kongwe offers advice which goes against Fuli's fast lifestyle. Although Makini is amazed by her wiseness, Fuli is positive that the trip will be a long one. Meanwhile, the Lion Guard are on their patrol, when [Ono](/wiki/Ono)spots four [hyraxes](/wiki/Hyraxes)running across an unstable stone bridge. Kion orders Ono to direct the hyraxes away from the crumbling bridge and he does so, just in time. With the hyraxes still thirsty and no other way to transport them across, Beshte proceeds to pick up a large rock nearby and uses the broken bridge to escalate himself and the rock to the sides, creating a temporary bridge. The hyraxes run across safely, and Beshte is commended for the idea of \"The Big B Bridge\". Back with Fuli, the [cheetah](/wiki/Cheetahs)is confident that if they keep up the pace, they'll arrive back at Pride Rock before sundown. But when she turns around, Kongwe and Makini have vanished. She finds them back a bit, where Kongwe has stopped Makini to observe (another) flower. [Fuli](/wiki/Fuli)reminds her that they also need to see the King, but Kongwe keeps returning to the subject of observation, leading Fuli to explain how [she sees things when she's going faster](/wiki/The_Faster_I_Go). After her explanation, Kongwe thanks her for sharing it, then recoils into her shell to ponder Fuli's words. Elsewhere, Kion asks Ono to look out for Fuli and [Kongwe](/wiki/Kongwe). He is unable to see them, but suddenly notices a herd of [elands](/wiki/Elands)trapped in a wildfire over at the [Poromoko Crevasse](/wiki/Poromoko_Crevasse). The Lion Guard race away to help them. In the Pride Lands, Kion asks Ono to guide them to the elands, who are lost in the smoke. Despite Ono's advice, Kion, Beshte, and Bunga locate the elands regardless and guide them away from the fire. Ono suggests getting them into the canyon, and Beshte starts to lead them down. However, a spark kindles the bushes as he passes them, blocking the path. Ono searches for another way, but the narrowest part of the canyon is still not enough for the elands to jump. Noticing a large rock, Kion asks Beshte to provide another bridge up ahead. He does as requested, and the elands make it across to the safe side. Soon Makchua meets with Fuli in the Backlands and Fuli finally catches him and chases him off. They converge paths with the rest of the Lion Guard at sunset. When Kion speaks with Fuli, he is surprised to hear her mention the clouds, instead of replying to his question. When they return to [Pride Rock](/wiki/Pride_Rock), Kongwe confesses that not even she is sure how to defeat [Scar](/wiki/Scar). She claims that \"it is the patient animal that eats the ripe fruit\", which confuses all but Fuli, who translates for the others by saying that what she means is that they will find the solution eventually and that they just need to look. Kongwe assures everyone that she has seen many things, and that good will always triumph over evil, in time. The Lion Guard is in [The Kilio Valley Fire](/wiki/The_Kilio_Valley_Fire)[ ] [Kilio Valley](/wiki/Kilio_Valley), desperately trying to put out a fire. After extinguishing the blaze, they announce that [Ma Tembo's Herd](/wiki/Ma_Tembo%27s_Herd)can finally return home. [Zito](/wiki/Zito)is still mildly annoyed that they were unable to save his favorite grove, but [Ma Tembo](/wiki/Ma_Tembo)is grateful. Suddenly, more flames arrive from the sky and rekindle the valley. Ma Tembo offers her strongest [elephants](/wiki/Elephants), Zito, [Zigo](/wiki/Zigo)and [Johari](/wiki/Johari), as extra help. She leaves them in the care of the Lion Guard and they get to work. Zito and Zigo assist Fuli and Bunga with the fire breaks, while Johari, Beshte, and Ono work on putting out as many flames as they can. Ma Tembo walks her herd away from the fire but is stopped by [Janja's clan](/wiki/Janja%27s_Clan). She orders everyone to protect the little ones and redirects her herd, only to discover [Reirei's Pack](/wiki/Reirei%27s_Pack)waiting for them. With her only other pathway blocked by [Kiburi's float](/wiki/Kiburi%27s_Float), Ma Tembo is forced to back down. Ono overhears [Janja](/wiki/Janja)'s cackling and quickly notices the danger. He reports to Kion, who knows that [Scar](/wiki/Scar) is behind the situation. He orders Ono to leave the fire and save the elephants and to tell the rest of the Guard and elephants the same. When the [Outlanders](/wiki/Outlanders) start to attack Ma Tembo, the Lion Guard intervene. Outnumbered, and with the blaze reaching closer, they are forced to retreat. Ono scouts out a route, and Beshte creates a path for the elephants, while Bunga and Fuli keep them safe. Safe from the fire, Ma Tembo laments over her burning home. Kion apologizes, but Zito reacts angrily to the cub for not working faster. Ma Tembo accepts that her home will return, but turns to the Lion Guard leader for help in finding temporary accommodation. Kion is determined to help her with her request. Kion leads Ma Tembo to her new home: [Ndefu Grove](/wiki/Ndefu_Grove). Zito has reservations, Kion assures him that the [galagos](/wiki/Galagos) are very welcoming. As if to prove his words, [Laini](/wiki/Laini) greets them amiably. Before Kion can even explain the full situation, Laini gladly welcomes them into her home. But when the elephants enter the grove, their large size causes them to smash into the trees, knocking Laini and [her galagos](/wiki/Laini%27s_Group) to the ground. Although Kion temporarily solves the problem by getting the elephants to stop, Ma Tembo realizes that they cause trouble for the galagos, forcing him to find them another home. Then, Kion moves the herd to [Acacia Grove](/wiki/Acacia_Grove), where [twiga's herd](/wiki/Twiga%27s_Herd) live. Since both animals are large and eat leaves, he believes it to be a perfect match. Although hesitant, [Twiga](/wiki/Twiga) accepts the proposal. But before the Lion Guard can leave, Twiga approaches them having witnessed Zito take down an entire branch. Worried that there won't be enough food to go around, Kion assures an angry Zito and his herd that he will find them a new home. As a last resort, Kion takes the elephants to [Bupu](/wiki/Bupu) and [his herd](/wiki/Bupu%27s_Herd), asking him to let the elephants stay just for a while. Bupu accepts, mostly due to Kion's politeness with the request. Ma Tembo thanks Bupu, and the elephants start to celebrate by spraying themselves with dirt, which also falls on the [Sable Antelopes](/wiki/Sable_Antelopes). This behavior is deemed unacceptable by Bupu. Before he can throw them out, Kion asks him just to give him a little time and leads the Lion Guard away. Kion asks Ono to check on Kilio Valley, to see roughly how long it will take before the elephants can go home. Ono does as instructed, and reports back that the hyenas, vultures, [jackals](/wiki/Jackals), and [crocodiles](/wiki/Crocodiles) are all there. It doesn't take long for Kion to understand Scar's plan and believe himself to be the reason it was a success. While Kion ponders what to do next, Ono notices the elephants being kicked out of their new home by Bupu's herd. Kion approaches the elephants and tries to reassure them, but Ma Tembo has made up her mind and announces that she and her herd will be leaving the Pride Land but Ono alerts Kion to a new problem. A fire has broken out in Ndefu Grove. After checking on Scar's army, he reveals that they're too busy fighting, meaning the fire is natural. When they reach the grove, Laini pleads with them to save her galagos. Fuli, Kion and Bunga locate the galagos in a tree and catch them when they jump. When Kion passes Beshte, the [hippo](/wiki/Hippopotamuses) warns him that he and Ono can't put the fire out fast enough. Kion races away to get help, while Bunga and Fuli reunite the galagos with Laini. Kion reaches Ma Tembo's herd and explains the problem. Considering the [Pride Landers](/wiki/Pride_Landers) to be her family, Ma Tembo agrees to help, ordering [Mtoto's mom](/wiki/Mtoto%27s_Mom) to stay behind with the little ones. They set off, but Zito refuses to help and stays behind with Mtoto's Mom and the younger elephant calves. Haven taken the route through [Lake Kiziwa](/wiki/Lake_Kiziwa), the elephants arrive and quickly spray the blaze with water dispersed from their trunks. While Kion checks the area, a tree collapses. Zito arrives to save him from being crushed, having finally decided that you don't turn your back on family. Kion thanks the elephant, and the elephants use dirt to put out the remaining fire, saving most of Ndefu Grove. After seeing them save their home, Laini thanks Ma Tembo's herd, and asks her to live with them. After accepting their offer, Ma Tembo gazes out at her true home, and Kion promises her that they'll get her home back. Although Ma Tembo knows this, she is confident that Kilio Valley is just land, and that they already are home. [Undercover Kinyonga](/wiki/Undercover_Kinyonga)[ ] The Lion Guard watch over the Outlands, waiting for Ono to return. When he finally comes into view, he is being pursued by [Mzingo](/wiki/Mzingo) and [Mwoga](/wiki/Mwoga). Luckily, a failed attacked results in Ono's safe escape. He returns to the [Pride Lands](/wiki/Pride_Lands) and reports that he saw the [hyenas](/wiki/Hyenas) on their way to Scar and that the [jackals](/wiki/Jackals) and [crocodiles](/wiki/Crocodiles) are still in [Kilio Valley](/wiki/Kilio_Valley). Before they can wonder what Scar is up to, they hear [Thurston](/wiki/Thurston) yelling \"panic and run\", and [his whole herd](/wiki/Thurston%27s_Herd) starts to run. The Lion Guard swiftly leap into action and calm the herd down, questioning his behavior. Thurston reveals that a nearby rock was the problem. Although the Guard can't see anything, Thurston and his herd are firm that the rock was talking to them. Suddenly, Twiga approaches them with a similar problem, involving a talking tree. With Thurston about to panic again, Kion assures everyone that they will get to the bottom of it, and the animals start to leave. The Lion Guard investigate Twiga's tree. When Ono lands on a nearby trunk, he is startled when something runs over his foot. At first, Fuli comments that she can't see anything when a [chameleon](/wiki/Chameleons) accidentally reveals herself to them. She disappears and runs away, but Fuli is able to track her by scent. When she locates her, the chameleon brushes Fuli's nose with some grass to take away her scent. Bunga follows the chameleon up a tree, but she uses her tongue to grab a tree branch and smack him away from her. She lands on Beshte and skitters off his back, still running from the Guard. Kion explains that they just want to talk, but at this point, Ono has worked out how she is able to hide from them, and quickly locates her, despite her still being camouflaged. When Ono explains to her that he can see her due to being the keenest of sight, she realizes that they are the Lion Guard, and introduces herself as [Kinyonga](/wiki/Kinyonga). [explains how her special ability works](/wiki/Now_You_See_Me,_Now_You_Don%27t). Kion is pleased to meet her but asks her to be careful when camouflaged to avoid scaring animals. She agrees, and the Lion Guard leave. Ono apologizes again for not getting a good look at the Outlands after being spotted, and Kinyonga overhears their dilemma. She offers to slip into the Outlands undetected for them. Kion hesitates due to the danger, but when Kinyonga understands about Scar's return having heard it from the [skinks](/wiki/Skinks). She goes on to tell them that she's been to the Outlands before with no problem. Although still concerned, Kion accepts her offer, asking her to be back before sunset. The Lion Guard start to worry. Ono believes that her camouflage will protect her, when Bunga suddenly pops out from behind a clump of grass, having used camouflage himself. Kion asks Ono to take a look, which is when he notices Shupavu and her skinks chasing Kinyonga. He reports back, and Bunga suggests entering the Outlands and taking on anyone they come across. But Kion states that they need to save Kinyonga, not start a battle. He then has an idea on how to enter the Outlands without being seen. Shupavu and her skinks chase Kinyonga to a dead end. She tries to blend in, but she is too scared, and her colors run wild. Suddenly, Shupavu hears a voice, and the Lion Guard reveal themselves, using camouflage themselves to blend in with their surroundings. Not wishing to fight, the skinks retreat. Kinyonga is impressed, but quickly explains Scar's plan to the Guard.With no time to lose, the Lion Guard return to the Pride Lands. That night Janja's clan is at Hakuna Matata Falls, where they set the plan in motion. While Nne and Tano start straight away, Janja orders Cheezi and Chungu to push the biggest rock in. They do as commanded, but after commenting on the rock being 'squishy' Beshte reveals himself. Janja questions what they're doing and Kion speaks to him, leaving him wondering who spoke. One by one, the Lion Guard reveal themselves, chasing away Nne and Tano completely. When Cheezi and Chungu run past, Kion speaks to Janja again, who recognizes his voice. When Kion reveals himself from some logs, he catches up to Cheezi and Chungu. When he questions where they came from, Kinyonga appears to tell them that they learned it from her. Startled by the chameleon, the trio runs into the water, to Kinyonga's concern. Cheezi realizes that he didn't eat her earlier after all, just before they fall down Hakuna Matata Falls. After getting out of the water, Janja decides not to tell Scar about their defeat by the Lion Guard, and blame it on their \"personas\". Kion orders them to leave and they do as instructed. the cub turns to Kinyonga to thank her, but she disappears. The next morning, Ono reports that he was unable to find Kinyonga. Kion still wishes to thank her again and hopes they'll find her. Noticing Thurston's herd speaking to the rock from yesterday, the Guard approach it, and discover Kinyonga there, pretending to be the rock and speaking with Thurston. When asked why she left, she explains that she broke her promise not to scare anyone; having sent Janja's clan into the river by mistake. Bunga assures her that, when it comes to Janja and his hyenas, it doesn't matter relieving her. She promises again not to scare anyone, but when Thurston notices her, the herd panic and run. Kion tells her that it's not her fault, and the Guard leave to sort things out, while Kinyonga vanishes into the grass. Kion, his guard and Makini travel deep into the lair to discover the secret to defeating Scar. The guard faces many challenges involving, their strength, speed, bravery, keenest of sight and leadership to prove their worth. Viewing the many paintings of past Lion Guards adventures including Askari. At one point, they were shown to repel a mysterious group of evil black-maned lions who wanted to take over the Pride Lands but were stopped by Askari and his guard. Kion and his guard discovered they were the secret to defeating a great evil and with new determination they were ready to take on Scar. [Cave of Secrets](/wiki/Cave_of_Secrets)[ ] While the Lion Guard deals with saving pridelanders from dust devils at the same time Thurston boasts about being the success of the guard. Which doesn't go unnoticed by Scar's minions who seek his advice on how to beat them. The hyenas, crocodiles, and jackals so-called plans to use the guard's said weaknesses leaves the group very confused and after awhile having enough of their crazy plans. Kion instructs Ono to take a look in the Outlands to see the trio surrounding Thurston and quickly figure they got their crazy ideas from him. After mounting a rescue the guard escorts the zebra back to the Pride Lands. [The Zebra Mastermind](/wiki/The_Zebra_Mastermind)[ ] The Lion Guard has a battle with Janja's clan and Kiburi's float and they win. Jasiri pops out of nowhere and surprises Kion. Kion tells her that Scar is back and that they're not saving in the Outlands. Jasiri has a plan that she and her clan will help fight Scar by becoming a [The Hyena Resistance](/wiki/The_Hyena_Resistance)[ ] [Hyena Resistance](/wiki/Hyena_Resistance_(group)). She Ni Kwetu](/wiki/Kwetu_Ni_Kwetu)or \"home is home.\" Later Bunga heads over to Rafiki's tree because he wants to work on some of his moves. Madoa comes by explaining Scar's newest plan to attack [Mizimu Grove](/wiki/Mizimu_Grove). The guard heads there but only the jackles and crocs come to fight. After winning many battles Shupavu's group finds out what's going on and Scar orders his army to attack Jasiri's clan. When no one comes the guard starts to worry. Ono looks at the Outlands and says that Jasiri's clan is being surrounded by Scar's army. The Lion Guard goes to rescue them and Kion uses the Roar to blow them away. Jasiri saves Janja and asks him to join the Resistance but he refuses but still showed empathy. Jasiri tells Kion that she and her clan will hide from Scar. Bunga explains to Beshte that his moves were great this time until he falls overdoing them and the guard heads home. The Lion Guard rushes through the Pridelands after hearing Tiifu and Zuri calling for them. They complain about their fur and Kiara and Nala say that the guard is for emergencies only. Beshte suggests for the girls to go to the hot [The Underground Adventure](/wiki/The_Underground_Adventure)[ ] [mud pots](/wiki/Mud_Pots)at the edge of the Pridelands. The girls ask Kiara to come and Nala asks Kion to go too. Bunga suggests to come as well while Fuli, Beshte, and Ono finish morning patrol. Kion, Bunga, and Kiara play around in the mud. Soon Mzingo comes by and sets the place on fire. Kion asks Kiara and Bunga to handle with the firebreaks but they're too late. They all decide to hide in [Muhangu's](/wiki/Muhangus)den and find out that Tiifu is scared of the dark. She causes a rock slide and they try to find another way out. They soon meet a [golden mole](/wiki/Golden_Moles)named [Kuchimba](/wiki/Kuchimba)who helps them get home. He explains to Tifu that there's [nothing dangerous about the dark](/wiki/Nothin%E2%80%99_to_Fear_Down_Here). After Kuchimba leaves Kion soon finds a problem not knowing which tunnel to go through. They soon hear Thurston coming down one and they go through that hole. Kion decides to sniff out Muhangus once they find him they start to see daylight and Tiifu runs towards it. Thurston finds out that they were trapped underground he starts to panic and runs. Tiifu comes back to calm him down and walks with him. The rest of the guard meet up with them and say that they took out the fire. Everyone soon starts to head back toward Pride Rock. The Lion Guard stands by the Watering Hole when Thurston's herd comes to take their turn to drink. Bunga says that they need to wait for the giraffes to finish drinking. Soon a gorilla comes into the Pride Lands and starts messing breaking down trees. Kion, Bunga and Fuli go to stop him once they said that they're the Lion Guard [Beshte and the Beast](/wiki/Beshte_and_the_Beast)[ ] [Shujaa](/wiki/Shujaa)introduces himself. He says that he was sent by [Sokwe](/wiki/Sokwe)of the [Theluji Mountains](/wiki/Theluji_Mountains)to help the guard fight the Outlanders. Fuli wonders what Shujaa does and Shujaa responds with [Shujaa Ponda](/wiki/Shujaa_Ponda). Bunga introduces him to Beshte the strongest in the Pride Lands. Ono sees that Scar's army is attacking [Basi](/wiki/Basi)at Big Springs. Shujaa starts throwing rocks at the Outlanders. Kion notices that they have cleaned up to do. After the cleanup, Ono notices that the Outlanders are back in the Pride Lands. After learning where they are, Kion suggests cutting them off by moving through [Nyani Grove](/wiki/Nyani_Grove). Shujaa offers to help and begins breaking the trees down which makes baboons run towards the buffaloes. Kion tells Beshte and Fuli to go after them while he uses his roar to blow the Outlanders away. Shujaa thought that Kion's roar was the best thing he ever saw. Beshte soon has an idea and offers to help Shujaa control his strength. The pair soon encounters a worried [Laini](/wiki/Laini)with [her galagos](/wiki/Laini%27s_Group), who are at first startled by Shujaa's presence. They point to a [serval](/wiki/Servals)in [their tree](/wiki/Laini%27s_Tree), who Laini is certain wants to eat them. The serval explains that he was hunting a bird, but doesn't know how to get down. Beshte tasks Shujaa with assisting the serval, but is stopped before he can tear Laini's tree down completely. Beshte asks him to think first, and he obliges. He then conjures up another idea. Shujaa leans the tree to one side, allowing the serval to leave. However, while thanking Beshte, he releases the tree which catapults the [galagos](/wiki/Galagos)to another tree in [Ndefu Grove](/wiki/Ndefu_Grove). Shujaa offers to catapult them back, but Laini worriedly insists that they'll get back on their own, which causes Shujaa disappointment. Beshte tries to cheer Shujaa up, and another chance for the gorilla to prove himself arises when a [butterfly](/wiki/Butterflies)comes into their view, trapped between some stones. Beshte tells Shujaa to be gentle, and, after thinking about it, the gorilla carefully removes the tiny stones that are trapping the butterfly's right wing, setting it free. In his joy, Shujaa pounds a fist against the larger rocks, causing the largest to fall. Beshte pushes Shujaa out of the way just in time. Once again Beshte supports Shujaa, reminding him that no one got hurt. They soon come across [Kifaru](/wiki/Kifaru), who has given [Mwenzi](/wiki/Mwenzi) the day off and has in turn gotten lost on his way to the watering hole. After learning about Kifaru's poor eyesight, Shujaa reacts by punching a hole in the wall which is blocking him and sets Kifaru the right way around. Unfortunately, the wall is revealed to have been part of the [hyraxes](/wiki/Hyraxes)' home. This distresses Shujaa greatly, and even though Beshte is optimistic about finding them a new home, Shujaa realizes that he causes problems no matter what he does. Beshte calls for Shujaa to follow him while they find the hyraxes a new home, but Shujaa, feeling defeated, [laments about his accidental destruction](/wiki/Shujaa_Ponda_(Reprise)). [ostrich](/wiki/Ostriches)nest, not even noticing [Mbuni](/wiki/Mbuni)briefly return to it. When Beshte returns having found an even better home for the hyraxes, Shujaa explains that he won't be moving. Ono arrives to alert them of the Outlanders return to Big Springs, and this time, there's fire too. With Shujaa refusing to move, Beshte promises to return for him once the fire is put out. Beshte arrives just in time and tackles the crocodiles away. He asks his dad to order his pod into the water while he deals with the fire. Nearby, Kion faces off against Janja, when Beshte smashes him away and asks what he can do. Kion asks him to go on fire breaks and he does so immediately. Since the fire could spread if Kion uses the Roar, they have no choice but to fight normally. However, a tree snaps in half, causing Ono to cry out for them. Beshte notices and runs towards them, but his foot catches on an open root. The tree collapses on Beshte, whose leg is now injured. Kion asks Ono to get Shujaa. Shujaa comes to save Beshte and scares off Scar's army. He takes out the fire and says goodbye to the guard. He says that he will return if they need help. The Guard sees Bupu's herd on the run and tries to stop them. Bupu claims that he saw a jackal and Kion tells them instead of running that they should call for them. Seeing this gives him an idea to gather an army of Pride Landers to attack the Outlanders. They gather Ma Tembo's herd, Bupu's herd, Laini's group and Mbeya's crash. At first things don't go well they ask Bunga to wait by a tree. The animals are suppose to run to him fast and together. Only the galagos complete the course while the other animals are all on top of the each other. Seeing this Kion gets another idea and asks Makuu to teach the animals how to fight. Things don't go well as Makuu frightens the animals and his float leaves. Ono soon spots the Army of Scar attacking [Pride Landers Unite!](/wiki/Pride_Landers_Unite!)[ ] [Makuu's watering hole](/wiki/Makuu%27s_Watering_Hole). Kion doesn't is ready however Ma Tembo, Mbeya, Bupu and Laini say that they are and they go fight. After a tried battle Kion uses the Roar of The Elders to blast the Army of Scar away. Makuu thanks them for saving his home and float. He says that if they ever need help in the future he will be there. Dhahabu's Herd comes into the Pride Lands and as a speical guest. The guard makes sure that the animals aren't in anyone elses way. While making their way up to Pride Rock they sing \" [The Queen's Visit](/wiki/The_Queen%27s_Visit)[ ] [Prance With Me](/wiki/Prance_With_Me).\" Dhahabu meets King Simba and the rest of the Royal Family. Bunga thinks that her dance moves were amazing while Beshte thought that she could sing good. Dhahabu comes by to see her old friends and they all take her on a tour. Soon there was a fire caused by Dry Lighting and Fuli helps the girls over it. While the rest of the guard along with Kiara's help takes out the fire. Dhahabu soon finds out that she needs a guard. She asks Fuli, Tiifu and Zuri to be here guards. Kion doesn't like the idea at first since Fuli's a member of the Lion Guard. He goes with it anyways. While on patrol the guard runs into Starehe and Raha who aren't happy about being without Dhahabu. Meanwhile Dhahabu learns about baboons Reirei's pack comes to attack the girls the guard, Starehe and Raha comes to save the day. Dhahabu doesn't see them in fighting the jackal and wants Fuli, Tiifu and Zuri to ber her permant guards. None of the girls want that Kion says that Starehe and Raha should be her gaurds. Soon Reirei's pack comes back and this time they have a couple crocodiles join them. [Starehe](/wiki/Starehe)and [Raha](/wiki/Raha)save the girls and become Dhahabu's permant guards. That night Dhahabu speaks to the Pridelanders and says that she will share her Watering Hole with them forever. At [The Fall of Mizimu Grove](/wiki/The_Fall_of_Mizimu_Grove)[ ] [Big Springs](/wiki/Big_Springs)Beshte and his dad are talking, but suddenly, there is something in the water Beshte dives in and finds a false alarm, it was just a little hippo named [Kiazi](/wiki/Kiazi). Then, the guard comes and realizes there is also something in the grass, it was another false alarm, it was just Timon and Pumbaa, they were just following a bug, then Makini comes up and sinvites the Guard to her [Mpando Mpaya](/wiki/Mpando_Mpaya). Makini has to present and plant it at Mizimu Grove. But the Skinks were watching and went back to inform Scar, then he comes up an idea to take over Mizimu Grove, that sunset, Timon and Pumbaa present a song called [Tujiinue](/wiki/Tujiinue), but the hyena's, crocs and jackals attack. The Lion Guard dealt with them, so did some of the [Pride Landers](/wiki/Pride_Landers)as in [Pride Landers Unite!](/wiki/Pride_Landers_Unite!), they attacked the Outlanders, but suddenly fire comes down from the sky. An day it burned down [Rafiki's Tree](/wiki/Rafiki%27s_Tree), and then Scar showed up in front of the Pride Landers, He told Simba that he took over [Kilio Valley](/wiki/Kilio_Valley)and wrecked Big Springs, and has now taken over Mizimu Grove, Simba wipes away the Mark of Evil. The guard goes to calm down the herd while Kion used the roar on the outlanders. The herds weren't very happy that Kion didn't tell the herds that scar was back, but Simba told the herds that he wanted Scar's return to be a secret, Ma Tembo didn't like his decision but liked his reasons, so the herds took a vote to leave or not That night in Mizimu Grove Kion talked to his grandfather, Mufasa that he thought he failed, but Mufasa Said \"even in the darkest day, there is still hope.\" But suddenly Kion saw something, on sunrise at Pride Rock, Basi's Pod reached a decision, but Kion stepped up and showed the thing he saw at night in Mizimu Grove, it was Makini's Mpando Mpaya. All the Pride Landers agreed to stay, Makini questions if she could plant her tree. Fuli sings the song that Timon and Pumbaa did as Makini's tree is planted. The Lion Guard were on patrol when all of sudden they notice fire falling from the sky near Twiga's herd. Ono tries fly high enough to see who is behind all this but fails. Beshte knows someone who can help an eagle named [Fire from the Sky](/wiki/Fire_from_the_Sky)[ ] [Anga](/wiki/Anga). Through her help she discovers that the vultures are the ones throwing the fire sticks. Ono suggets getting Hadithi to help them as well. Beshte says that he last heard that Hadithi was at [Urembo River](/wiki/Urembo_River). While locating him, Ono and Anga [sing together](/wiki/Height_and_Sight)and fly across the Pride Lands. Hadithi is surrounded once again by adoring fans as he tells Ono's tale to them all. Anga is excited to meet Hadithi, and Ono explains that he needs their help. Hadithi and the birds return to the Guard, where Kion and Hadithi proceed to explain the situation.

In the battle Hadithi sees Mwoga fighting with Ono and asks for the [Bee-eaters](/wiki/Bee-eaters)to help him. During the battle Hadithi gets trapped in a thorn bush while trying to save Anga. However, the birds in the sky need a leader, and Hadithi knows that Ono and Anga can do it. They take to the sky and finish their mission, rounding up the vultures for Kion to use his Roar of the Elders on them. Once down safely, Hadithi frees himself and Kion thanks the birds for their help, stating they'll be ready when the vultures come back. Kion speaks with the Lion Guard knowing that as long as their around the Pride Lands won't end. Soon Anga comes saying that the Outlanders are attacking the guard goes to fight. Years later after defeating Scar's army several times, Kion and the guard have grown up into teenagers. Kion uses his roar when Simba and Rafiki come up. Rafiki says that the roar is getting stronger as Kion gets older. Simba says that it's time to defeat Scar once and for all. They come up with a plan and gather the Pride Landers. Later that night Zazu says that Shujaa and Hadithi have came to help. Kion starts to worry if there's no way to ever defeat Scar. Simba tells him to get some rest.

The guard goes into his pool and swims out. Soon Scar comes on top of Pride Rock and says that Kion is gone. But he and the guard shows up and Scar says that there's no way to defeat him.

They soon reach up to Scar where he asks Ushari to charge at Kion. He gives Kion a scar of his own. Kion soon says that he'll never be like his great evil uncle. But Scar says that they're the same and there's no other choice. Kion thinks of another choice and forgives Scar for what he's done. He then blows on Scar to make it rain on him. Scar soon melts and is defeated. Ushari being mad charges at Kion but Bunga tackals him. Ono grabs Bunga out of the fire. Kion knows that they have won. Kion and the Lion Guard come outside and the Pride Landers cheer. The Outlanders are still upset but Janja says that Jasiri should be in charge. The Outlanders don't like but they don't care. They soon notice that Ono can't see. They get Ono to Rafiki. Rafiki says that there's nothing he can do about Ono's eye. However for Kion's scar he says to go to the [Battle for the Pride Lands](/wiki/Battle_for_the_Pride_Lands)[ ] [Tree of Life](/wiki/Tree_of_Life). Ono might get healed too. Anga soon becomes the new Keenest-of-Sight while Ono becomes the smartest. Now with six members on the guard they leave the Pride Lands. Nala and Simba wishes them good luck and is hoping to come back before Kiara's first hunt. The Guard leaves with the Pride Landers that they've helped and met throughout the seasons are wishing them goodbye. Kion talks to [Thurston](/wiki/Thurston)who says that the zebras will protect the Pride Lands while they're gone. Sometime after leaving the Pride Lands, Kion asks Anga how much farther it is to get to the next Waterfall. She says that it's not far and she sees the next moja kwa moja stone. Makini says that they're on the right path to the Tree of Life. Ono remembers Rafiki's map and says that the Back Lands Waterfall is the first landmark after Pride Rock. Kion tells Anga to lead the way. When they make it to the stone Ono says they need to find a iroko tree. While on their way to the tree, Makucha's leap comes by to attack the guard. Makini drags Ono to a top of a tree so he will be safe. During the fight a dust storm comes and the guard starts to blow away. They soon find shelter but Makucha's Leap follows them. Makucha says for them to leave but there's no where else to go. Kion says that they need to get along and stay in the spot. Makucha says that he wants them and he'll show them the way out, Fuli talks to Kion alone saying that she doesn't trust him. But Kion wants to get to the Tree of Life as fast as possible. The Guard leaves with Makucha's leap and Makucha over hears Makini talking about the Tree of Life. He explains to his friends about the Tree of Life. He says he'll kidnap Makini and get her to tell him how to get to the there. Kion thinks that Makucha left but he didn't. He kidnaps Makini and Kion tries to save her. Bunga falls and hangs onto a tree but is saved by Anga. After Makucha lost the guard continues on their journey. Makucha says that he'll follow the guard to the Tree of Life. The Guard makes it to the iroko tree and Kion thanks Ono for getting them out of the harmanttan. [The Harmattan](/wiki/The_Harmattan)[ ] The Lion Guard climbs up a snowy mountain Makini doesn't remember climbing up the mountain the last time she went to the Tree of Life. Ono says that the map says they need to go around the mountain but going over it will be quicker. Kion soon slides down the mountain making the rest of the guard slide down too. Ono almost falls but is saved by Anga. Beshte stops them before they slide off a cliff. Kion says to try it again but Fuli says they should go around the mountain. Kion says they're going the way he wants to go since he's the leader. Kion then suggests finding a short-cut through the mountain. Makini spots some [The Accidental Avalanche](/wiki/The_Accidental_Avalanche)[ ] [Snow Monkeys](/wiki/Snow_Monkeys)and says they could help us. However it turns out that they're scared of large birds. Anga tries to talk them but they just panic. Kion then uses the Roar of the Elders to blast a hole through the mountain, the roar made an avalanche happen and the guard saves [Yuki's Troop](/wiki/Yuki%27s_Troop), the monkeys start to get scared of Anga again but Kion says she's a nice bird. After seeing their home destroyed Kion suggest finding them a new home, they find a hot spot which is surrounded by a bunch of trees, the snow monkeys are scared of the trees because it attracts big birds. Soon a group of flying squirrels come by, the Guard tries to protect the snow monkeys from the squirrels, after talking to the squirrels the guard sees the monkeys have ran away. Turns out they're hiding in snow and Bunga is with them, Anga pulls all of them out and Kion finds them a better home, the Lion Guard hangs out with the snow monkeys in their new home, The snow monkeys starts to like Anga. Kion thanks Fuli for her help even thought he doesn't make the right decisions he knows that she's on his side. [Ghost of the Mountain](/wiki/Ghost_of_the_Mountain)[ ] Still on the snowy mountain, the Lion Guard has fun while playing a snowball fight before coming across a forest of [bamboo](/wiki/Bamboo) trees. Recalling the next [moja kwa moja stone](/wiki/Moja_Kwa_Moja_Stones) to be somewhere in the [forest](/wiki/Bamboo_Forest), Ono realizes they must go through the forest to find it. As they enter the forest, Kion positions Anga as a lookout, who quickly spots some Tuliza for him on a nearby ledge, much to Makini's relief, who remarks on their dwindling stock. Bunga runs ahead and gets the plants. However, during a victory dance, Bunga falls off the ledge and into the snow. Anga explains the strange animals to Ono, who realizes they are red pandas. However, he points out that red pandas are solitary animals, wondering why there is a large pack in front of them. The red pandas begin carrying Bunga away, prompting the Guard to follow, with Makini picking up the tuliza on the way. Reaching a clearing, the guard finds Bunga on a pile of logs, still surrounded by the red pandas. After a while, the Lion Guard approach Dughi, one of the red pandas, presenting themselves as friends of Bunga, though the red panda claims Bunga to be Sonnesen Kuhn, their \"Chosen One\".Dughi explains to the Guard that they believe Bunga to be Sonnesen Kuhn, a legendary hero destined to fight and defeat the dreaded Ghost of the Mountain. Kion tries to clear up the misunderstanding, explaining that Bunga is a member of the Lion Guard and not their Chosen One, though the pandas refuse to let Bunga leave until he defeats the Ghost. Soon after, an elderly red panda named Domog, keeper of legends of the red pandas, emerges from the bamboo and presents himself to the Guard. Domog tells the Guard of the Legend of the Ghost of the Mountain, describing the Ghost as an invisble force that terrorized the pandas and forced them from their homes. Now living in fear, the pandas have waited for the arrival of Sonnesen Kuhn, the Chosen One who will defeat the Ghost and give them back their freedom. The Guard discuss whether to help the pandas, not really believing the Ghost to exist. Ultimately, Kion decides to help get rid of the \"ghost\", believing that even though they are no longer in the Pride Lands, they are still the Lion Guard, and they protect the Circle of Life.Leaving the red pandas, the Guard begin crossing the mountain to find the Ghost. Soon, a barely visible white blur passes them by, who realize is the Ghost. The Ghost plays around with the Guard, at one point scaring Beshte against a wall, with the impact dropping stalactites around them. Dodging the ice, the Guard manages to escape, with Fuli rescuing Makini's staff in the process. Moments later, the Ghost returns and torments the Guard again. However, Anga gets a small glimpse of the ghost as it jump over a rock, and discovers the \"ghost\" to be a big cat with white fur. Ono recognizes the ghost to be a snow leopard, whose white fur cause them to blend with the snow and disappear from sight. After finding a set of tracks left by the snow leopard, the Guard follows the footprints before getting ambushed by the Ghost before it disappears again. This time, Anga spots the Ghost and forces it against arock, removing its camouflage, allowing the Guard to surround it. The snow leopard, presenting herself as [Chuluun](/wiki/Chuluun), refuses to stop terrorizing the red pandas, finding it fun, before mocking the concept of the Circle of Life, stating that she makes her own rules. Planning to punish the red pandas for daring to challenge her, Chuluun tries to escape the Guard through the snow, despite Bunga's attempts to stop her. As Bunga laments his failure after losing his paint, doubting that he might be the Chosen One after all, the Guard hear the red pandas screaming. Using her vision, Anga discovers Chuluun attacking the red pandas, now visible as a result of Bunga's paint having rubbed off on her. The Guard rushes back to the clearing to stop Chuluun who, still believing she is invisible, briefly mocks the Guard before making her escape. Bunga tells the red pandas that, since they can now see the Ghost, they no longer have to fear it. Hailing Bunga as the Chosen One, the red pandas ask him to get rid of the Ghost for good. Bunga rallies the red pandas together, believing that they can all defeat the Ghost. Climbing up the mountain, the Guard soon come across Chuluun, still believing herself to be invisible. As a result, Bunga catches her off-guard by leading a charge against her, surrounding her on a cliff. However, Chuluun quickly covers herself with snow, cleaning her coat and turning invisible, scaring the red pandas again. Domog remains calm, however, believing the Chosen One will save them. After Kion nods in approval, Bunga asks the red pandas to keep the Ghost surrounded as he turns to face her. While Chuluun mocks Bunga for believing himself the Chosen One, Bunga in turn wonders if Chuluun is really a ghost before running to her and spraying her with his stink, the stench Chuluun to back against the cliff and fall to the snow below. After the stench wears off, the red pandas cheer over the defeat of the Ghost, carrying Bunga away as Domog declaring the legend of the Chosen One to be fulfilled.Back at the clearing, Domog reveals that, following the defeath of the Ghost, the Chosen One continues on his way, much to Bunga's dissapointment. However, Domog thanks Bunga for teaching them that, althought red pandas prefer to be alone, they can come together when they must, meaning they won't have to be afraid again. At that point, Makini discovers the moja kwa moja stone in the clearing, having been there all along. After Makini activates the stone, Ono, remembering the map, recalls that the next landmark will be found through the bamboo, then around a mountain. The Lion Guard continue on their journey and leave the red pandas, happy that the Ghost of the Mountain is gone. However, Chuluun is shown emerging from the snow in which she fell before coming across [Makucha](/wiki/Makucha). After presenting himself, Makucha offers Chuluun the chance to join him on his journey to the Tree of Life, noting that they are both very similar since they both seek revenge on the Lion Guard, as well as so much more. Interested, she agrees to join Makcuha, telling him to lead the way as they both start following the path taken by the Lion Guard to the Tree of Life. The Lion Guard walks through marsh and Fuli questions why they need to walk throught it. Kion ays they'll be on the other side soon. Anga says she can see the next moja kwa moja stone beyond the edge of the marsh. Bunga says that this place isn't bad and the snails are great. Fuli says it's nice for Bunga since he's not in the mud. However Bunga jumps into the mud and gets Fuli covered in it. They soon hear a bunch of screaming animals and Ono isn't sure what it is. Makini ets scared and hops on top of Beshte. Makini suggets getting Ono somewhere safe but Ono doesn't like the idea since they don't know what it is. Turns out it's a bunch of [Marsh of Mystery](/wiki/Marsh_of_Mystery)[ ] [mongooses](/wiki/Mongooses)who are trying to attack the Lion Guard. Meanwhile Makini spots a blue light and tries to follow it. She gets them lost and they fall through the marsh. Back a the guard the mongooses are throwing mud at the lion guard. Once the mongooses leave Kion asks Ono why they were mad. They notice that Makini and Ono are missing. Turns out that they're at a cavern below the marsh. Makini tries to climb the cavern but she slips and she suggets for Ono to fly out. Which he can't do because of his eye sight. Back at the guard Fuli tries to sniff them out. Bunga has a bet with Anga and says he'll spot Makini and Ono before she does. The mongooses come back but Kion says they don't have time for games. Ono tries to think but he can't since Makini is making a lot of noise. Makini falls through a hole and waters comes out. She spots a tunnel and Ono suggets going through it. Ono soon starts to hear a sound which turns out to be [Bats](/wiki/Bats). Ono says he doesn't like bats but notices that they could be their way out. When they notices no bads around Ono suggets using echolocation. Back at the guard Fuli says she's having trouble sniffing them out with Bunga's yelling. Anga finds their tracks but Bunga says it first. They follow their tracks and notice that they're not here. Ono tries to snap his beak to hear a sound but Makini starts talking. When it doens't work Makini suggets having a high pitch sound. Ono says she should scream \" [Anything](/wiki/Anything).\" The pair thinks that they could be a great team when Ono notices they're getting close to the surface. Kion says that Makini and Ono are close and Bunga almost falls down the marsh. He says that there's no snails down there. He finds them under a rock. The monogooses start yelling again but Kion asks why they start attacking them. They explain that the Guard has been eating their snails. Makini and Ono soon come up and they knock over a log. The monogooses find the snails and starts eating them. That night Anga spots the next moja kwa moja stone and Bunga spots the blue light. Anga grabs him before he gets lost. Bunga spots more snails and asks Anga to let him go. Anga doesn't agree and flies off. Kion says that Anga spotted the next moja kwa moja stone. They soon hear a strange sound which happens to be water. Anga shows them an ocean. Kion asks if the next stone is in the ocean but Anga says it's on top of the hill. Bunga jumps in but notices there's no water. He soon gets washed away by a lot of water but is saved by a [Dragon Island](/wiki/Dragon_Island)[ ] [Dolphin](/wiki/Dolphins). The dolphin's name is [Lumba-Lumba](/wiki/Lumba-Lumba)and she says she's never met a Beshte before. She says that the ocean is her home.The guard goes to get some more [tuliza](/wiki/Tuliza). Then, a [civet](/wiki/Civets)comes and tells them about the [Komodo Dragons](/wiki/Komodo_Dragons). Soon, [Ora](/wiki/Ora)spots them and says he likes to play with his food. Makini drops the tuliza and the guard spreads out. Ora soon brings his friends to share the meal. Kion soon uses the Roar of the Elders on the dragons. The guard notices that Kion blew everything away even the water. The water soon comes back and the guard starts to run. Anga saves Makini but the rest of the Guard get washed away. Kion notices that the Roar made an island that they're stuck on. They soon hear [Lumba-Lumba](/wiki/Lumba-Lumba)who isn't in the water. Beshte and Bunga suggets making a hole of dirt around her. The water comes back but it doesn't reach her. Kion's scar soon starts to bug him and Fuli says that Makini will be back soon. Ono hinks he sees another dragon but Anga says it's just more rocks. The water soon tries to reach Lumba-Lumba and one big wave comes. The wave brings back Ora who tries to eat the dolphin. Bunga says that this is a job for a honey badger but Ora's friends come back. Bunga says it's a job for three honey badgers. Meanwhile Makini, Ono and Anga find the next moja kwa moja stone. Ono remembers Rafiki's map and says that there's a cliff with a tall tree on top. The rest of the Guard fight the dragons and Anga and Ono drop seaweed on their heads. Bunga soon uses his stink on Ora and Ono drops the seawed on him. Makini gives Kion some tuliza. He soon gets Lumba-Lumba back into the ocean. The Guard even escapes the dragons. The Guard continues onward. When Ora washes bake on land, Makucha and Chuluum ask him to join in on their mission. Makini spots the next moja kwa moja stone. Bunga says it's a painting of a river but he doesn't see one. Kion asks Ono where the next landmark is. Ono says he sees a pool of water with rocks all around it. Makini remembers the river she was her with her parents [Journey of Memories](/wiki/Journey_of_Memories)[ ] [Fikiri](/wiki/Fikiri)and [Kitendo](/wiki/Kitendo). Fuli is happy to cross the river without water. Beshte asks Makini if she was here with Rafiki. She says her mom and dad were taking her to the Tree of Life to meet Rafiki. She says that her mother says \"to test the water before diving in.\" Bunga says where's the fun in that and Makini says he sounds like her dad. Makini soon remembers a water fall which is the opposite direction from the pool. Kion says a little detour wouldn't hurt. It turns out the water has all dried up. Makini spots a painting that looks like a moja kwa moja stone but it isn't. Makini soon remembers a rock where you can be put you're hand through. The rock is covered up with dirt. Bunga soon kicks the rock and hurts his foot. Makini soon rememebrs a mountain that looks like a monkey's face. However the guard doesn't see anything and move on. Ono spots the next moja kwa moja stone. Ono soon remembers Rafiki's map and says there's a field with small white flowers. Kion tells Makini no more detours and they need to keep moving. Makini remembers another flashback with her parents. They say that Rafiki is excited to meet Makini since she'll be the next Royal Mjuzi. Anga says there's no white flowers but there's a desert. The Guard walks across the desert when Beshte starts to get burned. Anga flys over him to cool him off. A wind storm soon comes and the Guard takes cover. Makini hops down Beshte and makes a loud thump noise. Kion's scar starts bugging him and asks Makini if she brought them to the desert to have fun. Fuli suggests giving him some Tuliza. They soon meet a desert [jerboa](/wiki/Jerboas)who tells them to stop stomping while he's sleeping. Kion gets mad at him and he runs away. He suggests following their footsteps and go back to the next moja kwa moja stone. However another big sandstorm comes. Kion sees that there footprints have dissapered. Kion asks Fuli if she can track themselves by scent. Fuli says she can't tell. Kion eats some tuliza but he can't since it's covered in sand. They decide to make shelter and wait for night. The guard comes up to Makini and says that she's trying her best. The jerboa comes back Kion says sorry for scaring him. He says his name is [Tupp](/wiki/Tupp)and sees that they took his advice. Tupp soon shows them the flowers and says the water is in the plant. They all drink the water and Makini cleans the tuliza. They soon see stars in the sky that looks like flowers. Anga says the next moja kwa moja stone is on top of a cliff. Kion thanks Tupp for his help and the Guard continues on their way. The Lion Guard are all hot from their trek across the desert. Kion has trouble with his scar and he falls down a little hill, Makini tries to help Kion, but he says he doesn't need any. Fuli asks if he might need some more tuliza, Makini opens up her gourd to get it, but there is no more Tuliza. Anga says she'll go find some. Bunga starts to become thirsty and Kion doesn't want him to fool around. Anga finds some water, but it's very far away. They soon spot a sea which turns out to be salty water. Makini suggests floating in the salty water. Kion tries and soon the rest of guard relax, all except for Fuli. She offers to go and get the tuliza herself and goes on her way. Anga says that they need to get going to the Tree of Life. But Kion doesn't want to leave since he feels so relaxed. Soon a huge flamboyance of [The Race to Tuliza](/wiki/The_Race_to_Tuliza)[ ] [flamingos](/wiki/Flamingos)on a migration arrive. While getting the tuliza, Fuli meets a male cheetah named [Azaad](/wiki/Azaad), who tells her to leave his territory. He then offers to race Fuli and if she wins he'll help her get the tuliza. Back at [Flamingo Beach](/wiki/Flamingo_Beach), Kion is confused on what's happening and Makini moves him away. Beshte says if the huge birds stay here Kion can't relax. Ono tries talking to them but they start to have a [Flamingo Dance Party](/wiki/Flamingo_Dance_Party). Azaad races Fuli and he wins the race which makes Fuli getting mad. She asks for a rematch and he agrees. Meanwhile at the beach they all try to keep the party down but fail to do so. At the second race Azzad almost falls from a cluff, but Fuli saves him. He says that he'll help Fuli get the tuliza. Kion soon gets mad at the flamingos and scares them. The two Cheetahs|cheetahs come back to the guard and Fuli overcomes her fear of water by jumping into the sea. Kion eats the tuliza and says sorry to the flamingos. Azzad says goodbye to Fuli and hopes to see her again. The Lion Guard soon continues on their journey. Beshte makes a new friend [Mama Binturong](/wiki/Mama_Binturong)[ ] [Tenuk](/wiki/Tenuk)and asks if theirs a lot of good plants to eat. He says the best plants there is. Bunga asks how the bugs are Tenuk says he doesn't eat bugs. Tenuk introduces Beshte and Bunga to his other friends. Beshte says that everyone is very friendly here. Tenuk says they're welcome to stay as long as they want.Fuli says that they're just passing through. Tenuk says if there's anything they need to let him know. Makini says they need some more tuliza. Tenuk starts to panics, runs away and says to leave him alone. Tenuk's friends questions the Lion Guard on why they scared him. Beshte said they didn't mean to scare him. Makini says all they asked for was tuliza. The two animals panic and run away. Bunga says that everyone's running away whenever Makini says \"tuliza.\" Beshte says that it's not Makini they're scared of. Fuli thinks that they might be scared of tuliza. A [porcupine](/wiki/Porcupines)named [Smun](/wiki/Smun)is there spying on the Guard. He runs to [Mama Binturong](/wiki/Mama_Binturong_(character))and tells her about the strangers and them talking about tuliza. Bunga yells \"tuliza\" at a [civet](/wiki/Civets). The civet is soon saved by Anga after he falls into a river. He soon panics and runs into the porcupine who says that they heard the civet say \"tuliza.\" [Tompok](/wiki/Tompok)says he was just saying the word. Kion's scar starts to bother him and Makini gets some tuliza. She gives it to Kion and Kion starts to feel better. Fuli asks Makini if she forgot and anything and she remembers her staff. She goes to the log where she placed it down but it wasn't there. Mama Binturong starts to eat the tuliza that she finds in Makini's gourd. he guard starts to track Makini's staff but has no luck. Fuli says they need to find her staff in order to find the [Tree of Life](/wiki/Tree_of_Life). They soon spot a [gibbon](/wiki/Gibbons)and asks him if he's seen the staff. He says to ask the mongoose. The mongoose says to ask the civet. The civet says to ask the [mouse deer](/wiki/Mouse_Deer). The mouse deer says to go back and asks the gibbons. The gibbons explains to the guard where to find Mama Binturong and Makini's staff. Bunga goes to her lair and fights Mama Binturong. Bunga uses his stink to ruin the tuliza. He also takes some of the tuliza to go. Mama Binturong says now she wants revenge on Bunga. Bunga comes back to the guard with Makini's staff. They soon head off on their journey to the Tree of Life. Kion is in a hurry to get to the Tree of Life and he makes the rest of the Lion Guard run as fast as they can. Bunga says to race Kion to the Tree of Life as long as he doesn't get in Kion's way. However, Bunga trips on a tree and he lands on top of Kion. They find a pond and [Friends to the End](/wiki/Friends_to_the_End)[ ] [Beshte](/wiki/Beshte)thinks it's a perfect spot for a break, everyone else agrees except for Kion, who gets mad at them for stopping, Kion says that they can rest once they get to the Tree of Life. [Makini](/wiki/Makini)tries to give Kion some [tuliza](/wiki/Tuliza), but it doesn't work, Kion tells everyone to keep moving. Bunga thinks that Kion will soon turn evil, just like [Scar](/wiki/Scar). [Fuli](/wiki/Fuli)tells Bunga not to think about that. While Beshte and Makini talk about the Tree of Life, [Anga](/wiki/Anga)spots a baby goose about to fall from its nest. Beshte goes to catch it and Anga puts it back on its nest. Another baby goose falls and is caught by Bunga. Then, a [mother goose](/wiki/Mother_Goose)comes and says they were just trying to learn how to fly. Kion says not to help any animals who don't need it. Bunga starts to get worried about Kion and says that [Rafiki](/wiki/Rafiki)might be right. While walking, a group of [peacocks](/wiki/Peafowls)come by doing their traditional display dance. Kion gets mad at them since one of them wasn't looking where they were going. Beshte soon meets a [clouded leopard](/wiki/Clouded_Leopards)named [Yun Mibu](/wiki/Yun_Mibu). Kion gets mad and scares Beshte's new friend away. He tells the Guard to quit making new friends and he tells Beshte to stop being nice. Fuli thinks that Kion is out of control and the two are about to fight. Bunga says that Kion is turning evil and Kion walks away. The rest of the Guard and Makini remind Bunga that they will be [Friends to the End](/wiki/Friends_to_the_End_(song)). Kion looks at his scar through water and he's worried to talk to his grandfather. He soon hears Scar inside his head and thinks that he maybe like Scar but will never act like him. Kion tries to walk back to his friends but falls down a cliff he hangs onto a tree. Anga spots Kion and asks if he needs help. She tries to reach him but couldn't she goes to get the rest of the Guard. Bunga tries to help Kion but couldn't reach him either. Bunga says even if Kion turns evil he'll still be his best friend. Bunga asks Fuli if she's got a plan. They decide that the clouded leopard could help him. Kion apologies to him and he asks Kion to never growl at him. When the branch starts to break Beshte tells Kion to jump and the clouded leopard catches him. After Kion is saved, the clouded leopard says goodbye and Kion apologies to his friend. Fuli convinces Kion that he needs a rest and that the Tree of Life can wait. Kion listens to his friends and takes a nap. Anga spots the last moja kwa moja stone and Kion asks how long it'll take to get around the lake. Anga says that it's big and could take all night. Bunga suggests that they can walk across the lake while Ono says they should test it first. Kion says that Bunga is right and it's the fastest way to go. Beshte soon sees the ice starting to break and Kion tells everyone to run. Makini gets stuck on the ice falls into the water. Kion helps her out of the water. They find the last stone but Makini dropped her staff into the river. Ono remembers Rafiki's map and says that the Tree of Life is close by. Kion says to head for the mountain pass but Fuli thinks they should wait until morning. Kion says he won't feel better until he gets to the Tree of Life. Bunga spots a beehive and tries to go and eat the bees and the honey. Kion tells him not to climb and Bunga causes a rock slide. Bunga gets stuck between rocks and Kion is mad. He says we need to clear the rocks and Bunga says they need to get him free. Soon a lion comes named [The Tree of Life](/wiki/The_Tree_of_Life)[ ] [Baliyo](/wiki/Baliyo)and attacks Kion. Soon the whole [Night Pride](/wiki/Night_Pride)comes to attack the rest of the guard. Kion uses the Roar on Baliyo and sends him flying. Fuli says that Kion is out of control and [Rani](/wiki/Rani)jumps on him. She introduces herself and says that she's leader of the Night Pride. Kion says that all they're doing is going to the Tree of Life. Rani can only imagine the damage that he can cause. She says that Kion and his friends will never be welcomed to the Tree of Life. The Night Pride soon leaves and Fuli suggests getting Bunga out from the rocks. After checking on her brother Rani goes back to the Tree of Life. She talks to her grandmother, [Janna](/wiki/Janna), and Janna asks if Rani brings Kion and his friends to the Tree of life. Kion goes for a walk alone and thinks about what he has done. Kion is glad that Bunga is out of the rocks but is unsure if they can get to the Tree of Life. The rest of the Guard says to go talk the to the Night Pride and Ono says they won't give up. The Night Pride comes back and is shocked to see the Guard still there. Kion apologizes to Rani for using his roar. He asks that if his friend Ono can make it to Tree of Life and says that his eyes need healing. After taking a look at [Ono](/wiki/Ono)she says that they're all welcomed to the Tree of Life. Baliyo asks Kion to never roar at him again and Kion promises. The guard finally arrives at the Tree of Life where they meet Queen [The River of Patience](/wiki/The_River_of_Patience)[ ] [Janna](/wiki/Janna). Kion explains that he and Ono have come to be healed. Janna notices that they have the Mark of the Guard and are from the Pride Lands. Janna has Nirmala their healings expert, take a look at Kion and Ono, who then reports her findings to the Queen. Janna explains that while healing Ono will be simple, with his remedy being ready in a few days, Kion's ailments will take both time and patience. Wanting to start right away, Kion is led away by Nirmala to begin his healing Janna asks Rani to show the others around execpt for Makini. As Kion heals with Nirmala, Rani gives the others [a tour of the Tree of Life](/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Tree_of_Life), explaining that the Tree of Life is special because it's home to every kind of habitat, allowing a wide variety of animals to live in it. Though they don't have many rules, Rani says all animals are welcome at the Tree so long as they respect the Circle of Life. Soon [Ullu](/wiki/Ullu) comes and warns Rani, she ends the tour and leaves with her. The guard finds Kion who is waiting for a log. Fuli tell him about Ullu fetching Rani. Realizing there might be trouble, Kion abandons his task and takes the Guard to the pass to help. By this point, though, the Night Pride has already beaten Makucha and the others, telling them to leave and never return. Kion and Rani show up in the chamber arguing. Rani angrily accuses Kion of leading an army of predators to the Tree of Life, believing they should never have allowed him to enter it. Remorseful, Kion apologizes for the trouble he has caused as the Queen notes the predators won't leave now that they've found the Tree of Life. When Kion offers to let the Guard help, Rani loses her temper, yelling that they can handle it. . While Janna appreciates Kion's offer, she agrees with Rani that it's the job of the Night Pride to deal with threats to the Tree of Life, telling Kion he must help himself before he can help others. She advises him to continue his healing, pointing its the reason he came in the first place. Back at the River of Patience, Kion gets frustrated waiting for the log, telling Nirmala he'd finish quicker doing things his way as his scar pains him.Kion goes back to heal with Nirmala. He keeps failing his task and is tired of Nirmala saying to \"try again.\" Kion soon comes to the guard and tells them about his problem. They all say that Kion never gives up and Kion is willing to try again. The next morning Kion does try again and finally gets on a log. At that point, Ullu arrives, saying Rani needs Nirmala because the predators are back. Hearing this, Kion insists on helping, though Nirmala tells him to stay focused and finish his task before leaving. Listening to Nirmala, Kion stays behind. Kion finally makes it to the top of the ridge. Before he reaches the flower, though, Kion hears Rani screaming and, rushing over, sees the Night Pride surrounded by Makucha's Army. As he starts to head over, though, Kion recalls Nirmala's order to finish his task no matter what, prompting him to grab the flower. Having finished the task and now able to help, Kion ruhes over as he holds the flower with his teeth, arriving just in time to save Baliyo from Chuluun. Kion's presence rattles the predators, with Ora quickly turning and running away in fear of getting hit with the Roar again. Rani tells Kion to follow her. Kion is about to follow Rani when Nirmala tells him to follow the path. Kion spots a nearby rocky winding path and, trusting Nirmala to guide him, follows it. Kion reaches the top of the hill moments before Makucha does, surprising the leopard and knocking him over the hill while Rani does the same with Chuluun. Kion and Rani quickly compliment each other before turning back to the predators. At this point, the rest of the Guard is seen arriving at the forest, with Bunga in particular hoping to not have missed out on the fight again. Coming across the leopards, Bunga quickly sprays them with his stink, sending them running away as Bunga yells at them to not come back. Coming across the scene, Rani tells Kion that they both make a good team.Both teams gather to check on Baliyo, with Nirmala confirming the venom will eventually wear off, much to Rani's relief. Kion spots his flower on the ground and, seeing it got trampled during the fight, begins to tell Nirmala of his failure. However, she tells Kion that getting the flower wasn't really the point of the task, noting he still managed to finish it. Bunga and Rani assume this means this Kion has been healed, though Kion doesn't feel too sure, guessing there's still more for him to do. Nirmala agrees with Kion, confirming he has taken the first step and still has a long way to go. Kion pauses to instinctively paw at his scar for a moment before stopping himself, realizing he doesn't feel pain, and agrees he just needs patience. Outside the mountain pass, the Army begins arguing amongst themselves again, feeling they could have won had Kion not shown up. Feeling the Lion Guard is nothing but trouble, they all agree they need to get rid of them. The Lion Guard safe for Kion are relaxing with Rani and Baliyo. Beshte notes it's nice to relax now that they're at the Tree of Life. Kion soon arrives at the lake, sporting a mud facial that Nirmala says will help treat the venom in his scar. After washing off the mud, Nirmala notes that while Kion is making progress, he still has a long way to go. However, she tells Ono she can now heal him, saying his remedy is ready. Realizing he will get his eyesight back, Ono gets excited and eagerly follows Nirmala to the Tree of Life to get healed. After they leave, Bunga starts chewing water bugs loudly, annoying Fuli. Baliyo, on the other hand, says his chewing is kinda quiet for a honey badger, making Bunga realize there are other honey badgers at the Tree of Life. Confirming this, Baliyo agrees to take him to meet his friend [Little Old Ginterbong](/wiki/Little_Old_Ginterbong)[ ] [Binga](/wiki/Binga). Bunga meets Bunga and competes in a bug eating contest. The guard soon makes their way to the Tree of Life to see Ono get healed. Bunga is disappointed about his lost to Binga. Anga's sarcasm inspires Bunga to have a stink contest, leaving the others to find Binga. Queen Janna soon welcomes Mama Binturong into the Tree of Life. She tells others to call herself \"Granny Ginterbong.\" Rani goes to show Granny to her new home. Later Janna tells Makini to put Ono in front of her, declaring it's time. Instructing Nirmala to pay attention, saying this will be her role soon, Janna places one paw in the tree roots in front of her and the other in Ono's bandaged eyes. The Tree of Life begins glowing with a strange light as energy passes through Janna to Ono's eyes. When the light dims back, Janna tells Ono that his eyesight will be better now, though it may never be as strong as it once was. After Makini removes the bandages, Ono's vision remains blurry for a moment before he makes out Queen Janna. Realizing he can see again, Ono happily turns around to see his friends before thanking Janna. He soon finds out Bunga isn't with the group, with Beshte explaining he is with his new friend. The Lion Guard exit the Tree as Ono flies through the air in his joy. Kion leaves the group to continue his healing while Ono tries searching for Bunga himself. However, Ono discovers that, while he can see again, his once powerful sight is gone. This discourages him as he realizes that Janna was right and he'll never be Keenest of Sight again. Ono then turns to Anga, who quickly finds Bunga and Binga. Soon the rest of the guard except Kion and Bunga finds Mama Binturong causing her to revert to her \"Granny Ginterbong\" persona. Ono takes the chance to present himself to her, glad that he can see a ginterbong for once. When the Lion Guard informs her they're meeting up with Bunga, Mama excuses herself by claiming to be too tired. As the Guard moves on, Ono takes a quick look back to see Mama Binturong climbing trees effortlessly despite limping just moments ago, making Ono suspicions.However, Ono turns back as he hears Bunga greeting the Guard and asking for him. When Ono flies over, however, Bunga interrupts Ono to present him to Binga. When Ono reveals he can see again, Bunga assumes that he healed Ono by touching him and brags to Binga about it, clearly caring more about her than Ono. Angered by this, Ono corrects him by saying Queen Janna healed him at the Tree of Life, though Bunga goes back to presenting Binga to the others. When Bunga naively asks for Kion, an annoyed Fuli says Kion is with Nirmala, just like every day since they arrived at the Tree of Life. At this point, Bunga leave the others to have a snowball fight with Binga, telling Ono to have fun looking around. As the Guard moves on, Ono witnesses Mama Binturong taking the Tuliza away from the pika before he is called by Beshte to tour the Tree of Life. The Lion Guard, save for Bunga, are seen resting on a field when Ullu wakes them, informing them Granny Ginterbong is being attacked at the icy river. Anga quickly spots Mama Binturong calling for help, saying Chuluun is attacking her. Though Anga reports not seeing Chuluun, Fuli believes she must have hidden in the snow. As the Guard moves in to help, Ono stops as he wonders how exactly would Granny Ginterbong know Chuluun's name. Thinking it over, Ono stops the Guard as he realizes it's a trap. Going over the clues he's picked up all, Ono realizes Granny is most likely working with Makcuha. Flying overhead, Anga spots the Army making their way to the Tree of Life, proving Ono right as Kion thanks him for his insight,Kion tells Ullu to warn Rani that Granny Ginterbong is a decoy, while he and the rest of the Guard faces off against the Army. After a brief fight, the predators leave as they realize the plan is ruined. At Ciso River, while waiting for the Night Pride to arrive, Mama Binturong spots Bunga and Binga in the middle of a snowball fight. Revealing herself to Bunga, Mama swears revenge on him for destroying her Tuliza. After she threatens to harm Binga, Bunga faces off and beats the binturong, causing Binga to say that Bunga is \"Bing-credible\", similar to Bunga's \"Un-Bunga-lievable\" catchphrase. Ullu soon arrives with Kion's warning about the ginterbong, prompting Bunga to explain she is a binturong while also quoting Ono by saying \"Common knowledge, really\". When Rani notes they need to make sure Mama leaves the Tree of Life, Bunga gets Binga to join him to catch Mama, at which point they spray her with their combined stink.At the Tree of Life, Rani approaches Ono, having been told by Ullu that he was the one who figured out Mama Binturong's plan. Ono mentions that, even if his vision may not be what it once was, he still wants to help as Rani to thank him. Kion agrees with Rani, saying that even if Ono isn't the Keenest of Sight, he is still the Keenest of Insight. Ono glances at the Mark of the Guard on his shoulder before looking up at his friends with gratitude, finally coming to terms with his self-worth and his role as the Smartest, as Kion declares Ono will always be a part of the Lion Guard. [Poa the Destroyer](/wiki/Poa_the_Destroyer)[ ] Beshte and Anga are seen in a lake watching Ono practice his flying, which Beshte calls \"Poa\". Grateful to have his sight back, Ono asks Anga to come with him and find out what else they can see, leaving Beshte at the lake. Besthe then comes across and Baliyo they watch him flirt with Binga in his dreams before waking up. Soon after, Kion leaves with Nirmala to continue his healing. Bunga goes to find Binga while Fuli goes for a run. Beshte is soon left with a sleepy Baliyo. He decides to see other animals around the Tree of Life. After a while the animals think that Beshte is a bad guy and they nickname him \"Poa the Destroyer.\" Rani goes to find Kion who is having [frogs](/wiki/Tree_Frogs) hop all over him as part of his therapy: according to Nirmala, this will help him stay calm when annoyed. Soon after, Rani approaches them, with Nirmala allowing Kion to come down from the tree. Bunga is left confused by it all, noting that everyone always likes Beshte. Hearing this, Ono comes up with a way to help Beshte. He proposes they give the animals a chance to know Beshte, believing they'll like him once they get to know him. Thanking Ono for his insight, Kion and Rani devise a plan: both teams will split, lure the animals to the Tree, and then bring Beshte afterwards, allowing them to meet him all over again. Confident that their plan will work, Kion thanks Rani for her help, though she only states that she is just doing her job as both stare at each other warmly. Bunga soon arrives with [Tangaagim](/wiki/Tangaagim) in tow, telling Baliyo they don't want to keep Rani and Beshte waiting. When Pinguino asks who Beshte naively tells him Beshte is \"Poa the Destroyer\", revealing the whole plan to the animals. Panicking, Pinguino waddles away from the group, refusing to be anywhere near Beshte. However, Pinguino come across Beshte and begins waddling away in fear from \"Poa\", ignoring Beshte's attempts to apologize and correct his name. Soon after, Besthe sees Pinguino climbing a dangerous cliff and, realizing he might get hurt, starts going around to keep him safe. At the Tree of Life, Rani thanks the animals for coming, sayings there's been a misunderstanding with one of their new guests. Kion, Fuli, and Ono explain that the one they know as \"Poa the Destroyer\" is actually Beshte, saying he really isn't a bad guy. The animals, however, remain unconvinced of their claims. At this point, Bunga and Baliyo arrive with Tangaagim and the penguins, apologizing for being late. When Rani then notices [Pinguino](/wiki/Pinguino) isn't with them, Baliyo explains that he refused to come. Noting Pinguino was the one who made the biggest fuss over Beshte, Rani stresses that he needs to be present. Kion sends Anga to find Pinguino and Beshte, who quickly returns saying she's found them both. Beshte and Pinguino soon arrive at the Tree of Life, both singing the \"Poa\" song as Pinguino rides Besthe's back. This surprises the other animals, who wonder why Pinguino is with \"Poa the Destroyer\". [Long Live the Queen](/wiki/Long_Live_the_Queen)[ ] The Guard and the Night Pride work together to save [Varya](/wiki/Varya) and her cubs from Makucha's army. Soon Ullu comes and says that Janna wants to see the Night Pride and Kion. Queen Janna soon completes her journey through the Circle of Life. They have her funeral and then Rani's coronation as the new Queen of the Tree of Life. Inside the mountain pass, Makucha's Army is once again confronted by the Night Pride. Soon the Lion Guard comes to help them. Bunga suggets for Kion to use the Roar of the Elders. Kion fears that he will lose control of it. The ensuing fight against the Army turns sour as Kion and Rani's orders overlap, causing both teams to crash into each other. Frustrated, Rani reminds Kion that she in charge. Listening to her, Kion asks Rani how can they help. [The Lake of Reflection](/wiki/The_Lake_of_Reflection)[ ] Rani instructs the Lion Guard to handle Ora while the Night Pride fights the leopards, leaving Mama Binturong to Ono and Anga. Under Rani's command, the Army is beaten and kicked out of the pass. After this, Kion apologizes for making things worse. While Rani assures Kion of his help, she does advise him to follow her lead from now on, doubting his capacity as leader. Angered, Fuli yells that Kion is a great leader, though Kion doubts this, pointing he became leader of the Guard when he got the Roar, but now he can't control it. Discouraged, Kion feels he shouldn't lead until he heals his scar. Seeing Baliyo yawning, Kion notes the Night Pride could use some rest. Rani, though, makes it clear they've can't since they're patrolling around the clock keeping the Army at bay. Wanting to help, Kion offers to have the Lion Guard patrol during the day while the Night Pride rests, allowing them to return to patrolling only at night. Rani agrees to the plan, saying she needs all the help she can get now that she's both Queen and leader of the Night Pride.As the Lion Guard prepares for the daytime patrol, Kion goes to continue his healing wth Nirmala leaving Fuli in charge. uli, though, tells the others to go on without her, saying she'll catch up. Approaching Rani, Fuli takes her aside to tell her Kion doesn't seem to be getting better. In fact, Fuli notes, Kion is even worse than when he first got to the Tree of Life, having now lost his confidence. Rani encourages Fuli to trust Nirmala, just like Janna did before she died. After Fuli leaves, Rani returns to the rest of the Night Pride, where she admits to agreeing with Fuli about Kion. The rest of the Guard is seen walking through a bamboo forest before coming across a group of lemurs led by [Kely](/wiki/Kely) fighting a giant panda named [Heng Heng](/wiki/Heng_Heng). Stopping the fight, the Guard listens to both groups argue over eating rights to the same bamboo stand, with Heng Heng explaining that pandas have specific eating schedules. Not willing to let them fight it out, Fuli suggests taking them to Queen Rani, saying she will know what to do. As Kion asks her if he should give up the Roar, though, the rest of the Guard come at the Lake with Keli's troop and Heng Heng, who then start presenting their case to Rani. Inspired by Kion's patrolling idea from earlier, Rani suggests they take shifts during the day, allowing them to share the bamboo stand. After both groups leave satisfied, Rani and the rest of the Guard let Kion return to reflecting, feeling they are interrupting him.As they make their way back, Rani tells Fuli that Kion is as healed as he's ever going to get, just like Ono's eyesight: healed, but not like it used to be. When Fuli starts making plans for the Guard to return to the Pride Lands, Rani also reveals Kion's fear that he can't lead without the Roar, much to their shock. Realizing Kion needs their support, the rest of the Guard go to him while a tired Rani leaves to get some rest. The rest of the Guard arrives at the Lake, surprising Kion, who knows they're supposed to be on patrol. Fuli says they are, and they're here to deal with an emergency: Kion himself.Fuli assures Kion that, even if he doubts himself, she and the others don't. When Kion starts to say he can't lead without the Roar, Anga tells him that he's always been a great leader, even before he got the Roar. When Bunga asks her how could she know this, given Anga met them all after Kion got the Roar, Anga explains she remembers seeing them all around the Pride Lands before that. Agreeing with Anga, Fuli tells Kion he needs to remember too, he needs to \" [Remember what makes him him](/wiki/Remember_What_Makes_You_You)\". Approaching Kion, Anga begins telling him a story, of a time when they were all much younger. Flashing back to the past, Anga remembers seeing Kion and Bunga in the middle of a race to the watering hole, with Bunga saying the winner is a rotten egg. Though Bunga wins the race, Beshte emerges from the water, saying he got there first, thereby making him the rotten egg. Bunga is okay with this, noting he still smells like one. Suddenly, Fuli runs up to Kion, saying a hyena is stealing an egg. Besthe suggests getting Simba for help, but Kion says they don't have time to get his dad. Realizing it's up to them to save the egg, the group starts running while Anga follows.The hyena is then revealed to be Janja rolling an egg to the Outlands hen Fuli stops him. Janja brings out Cheezi and Chungu. Kion, and help Fuli. Janja tells Cheezi and Chungu to distract the group while he steals the egg, calling them fur brains for the first time in the process. Springing into action, Kion orders Besthe and Fuli to take on Cheezi and Chungu while Bunga gets the egg, leaving Janja to him. Under Kion's command, the hyenas are defeated and sent running back to the Outlands. At that point, the four friends see the egg cracking and realize it's hatching. The egg hatches to reveal a newborn Ono, who chirps \"Hapana\" at the group. Watching from above, an impressed Anga compliments the Guard before flying on, ending the story. In the present, the Lion Guard (save Ono) realize they remember that day, with Fuli telling Kion it was the day he showed them how to be a team. Fuli and Anga tell Kion that, even if the Roar made him the leader of the Lion Guard, it wasn't make him a leader: he's always been one. Kion realizes they are right, noting he didn't know about the Lion Guard or the Roar back then. Bunga then asks him if is ready to lead them on patrol. Seeing the sunset, Kion realizes it's almost time for the Night Pride to take over. Suddenly, Ullu arrives, informing the Lion Guard that the Army is moving up the pass. Turning to his friends, Kion regains his confidence to lead and tells them to follow him. Having cleared the pass, the Army spots the Guard coming and move to fight them as Kion quickly realizes their battle strategy. As both groups engage each other, a tired Beshte is bitten by Ora, leaving him paralyzed. Anga spots the Night Pride (save Rani) approaching, with Kion quickly giving them instructions to fight the Army. As this is happening, Rani emerges from the Tree of Life to join her team. However, seeing Kion in charge, an impressed Rani stays behind to watch the fight, realizing Kion can lead.Kion's leadership helps both groups triump over the predators, sending them running back to the pass. After the fight, Nirmala checks Beshte's bite and says he will be fine as the venom is wearing off. At this point, Rani approaches them, noting Kion managed to handle everything even without her. Realizing Fuli was right, Rani calls Kion a great leader, cheering him up. Admitting he had forgotten that, Kion now realizes he just needed a little reflection. When Bunga asks if this means he will use the Roar again, though, a tired Kion admits he isn't sure yet, saying he will reflect on it tomorrow. Kion soon speaks to [Askari](/wiki/Askari) the leader of the first Lion Guard. As Kion completes his healing Rani worries if he and his friends are leaving the Tree of Life. Kion says that they need to patrol during the day so they can't leave. Kion tells Fuli to take charge for the day. While the rest of the Guard helps a camel Bunga questions why Kion isn't ready to use the Roar. Meanwhile, Kion learns new ways to use the [Triumph of the Roar](/wiki/Triumph_of_the_Roar)[ ] [Roar of the Elders](/wiki/Roar_of_the_Elders)while he is in [Cikha Escarpment](/wiki/Cikha_Escarpment)and talks to his ancestor [Askari](/wiki/Askari), the first lion guard. With his new improved roar Kion is able to defeat Makucha and his army once and for all. Rani then thinks that Kion and his friends should stay at the Tree of Life. As Kion's friends wonder if it's time to go back to the Pride Lands, Rani says that they can stay. Soon Ullu says that she spotted a cheetah making it's way to the Tree of Life. Turns out that it's Azzad who has brought Janja and Jasiri to the Tree of Life. Jasiri tells them the Guard that [Journey to the Pride Lands](/wiki/Journey_to_the_Pride_Lands)[ ] [Zira](/wiki/Zira)has returned. Kion tells Rani that they need to go home and protect the Pride Lands. Makini chooses to stay since she's Rani's Royal Mjuzi. Understanding, the rest of the Guard bid Makini farewell, knowing they will miss her. Realizing this is the end, Rani thanks the Lion Guard for their help defending the Tree, saying she considers them all members of her pride, placing her paw on their shoulders as she says goodbye to each of them. Turning to Kion, Rani tells him she meant what she said before, saying he and his friends will always be welcome at the Tree of Life. Having said goodbye, Kion and the rest of the Guard leave. Making their way through the pass at night, Kion thanks Jasiri for getting him and the others, though Jasiri claims she is just returning the favor after all the help he gave her in the past. A few ways behind them, Azaad talks to Fuli about the hyenas, finding it unlikely she would be friends with them, though she assures him that they've earned their trust. Outside the pass, Ono reveals he still remembers all of the landmarks from Rafiki's map, recalling the first on their way back to be the frozen lake. However, they soon realize that, even with the map, the road back to the Pride Lands will take time.Azaad then reveals he know another way to the Pride Lands, having traveled enough to know the fastest routes to all the Great Lands. However, Azaad points his shortcut only work for cheetahs, putting some of the Guard at a disadvantage. Wanting to take a look, Kion and the others follow Azaad to the shortcut: an incredibly narrow passage through a canyon. Realizing Beshte won't fit, the group considers going back to the slow route, though Kion refuses. Telling everyone to get behind him (which Janja knows what it means), including a confused Azaad, Kion uses the Roar to widen the passage, allowing them all to take the fast route. The next day, Azaad leads the group to a deep and wide ravine, saying they will have to cross it to get to the Pride Lands. While a cheetah can just leap across, Azaad notes the others will have to cross via land bridge, though the nearest one will take days to reach. Wanting to go as fast as possible, Kion uses the Roar to summon a small twister and carry Bunga across, surprising Janja and Jasiri. When Kion asks who's next, Janja starts to panic despite the others's attempts to reassure him that the Roar is safe. In the end, Jasiri gets to Janja by saying he is scared, with Janja wanting to prove otherwise .Kion then uses the Roar to move the hyenas and Besthe across, with the three enjoying the experience. While Fuli and Azaad jump across the ravine, and Anga and Ono fly over to the others, Kion uses the Roar to lift himself up in the air and make his way across. With everyone now on the other side, the group continue on their journey to the Pride Lands. Along the way, Bunga and Beshte see that Fuli and Azaad are just as close as Kion and the Queen, causing Kion to think back to Rani. Coming across a dried river bed, Azaad tells them they will have to turn and follow the river bed to its mouth. However, Azaad reveals the way to the mouth is far, saying they could get there by sunset if they were all cheetahs. Claiming they can get there before sunset, Kion claims his plan involves getting a dead tree into the river bed. When Beshte moves to knock it down, though, Kion stops him and brings the tree down himself, with Bunga pointing that Kion's new Roars make him a one-lion Lion Guard. Revealing they will ride the tree down the river, Kion uses the Roar to conjure up some storm clouds, briefly scaring Janja as he reveals he is scared of lightning, much to Jasiri's amusement.The Roar causes a flood to appear in the distance, with Kion telling the others to get on the tree and hold on tight. When Azaad begins to hesitate, Janja mocks him for being afraid of water, though Azaad argues that cheetahs and waters just don't get along. Climbing aboard the tree, the group braces themselves as the water reaches them, carrying them across the river. While most of the group enjoy the log ride, Janja gets seasick while Fuli tries to comfort Azaad about the water. While Azaad admits to enjoying being on the land, he is glad to share this particular adventure with Fuli. Soon after, the log flies over a waterfall, splashing everyone with water as they reach the mouth of the river. With the log ride now over, the group decide to continue the rest of the way on foot. Over the next days, the Guard pass by all of the landmarks they faced on their journey to the Tree of Life. However, Kion's new Roar powers help them move on through obstacles with ease, allowing them to move at a much faster pace than they initially did. After travelling for a while, the Lion Guard soon come across what Azaad calls the [Great Stone Wall](/wiki/Great_Stone_Wall), noting they're not so far from the Pride Lands now. Flying above, Anga realizes that the Wall is actually holding back a great big lake and, horrified, tries to get Kion to stop roaring. Unfortunately, the roar is too loud for Kion to hear her pleas, as Kion breaks the ridge, causing large amounts of water to rush through Shocked, Kion quickly dispels the water away with the Roar. Unfortunately, this doesn't solve the problem, instead making Kion the only thing holding the water in place for the time being. Looking around, Anga spots small herds of kilpspringers and hyraxes in the fields around them and realizes they will all be in danger if the water floods the valley. Taking over for the still roaring Kion, Fuli has Ono and Beshte help fix the Wall while she and the others (hyenas included) move the herds, needing to clear the valley in case the Wall can't be saved. Analyzing the situation, Ono comes up with an idea and tells Beshte to gather up all the rocks the Roar made when it smashed the Wall. As the rest of the Guard move the herds to safety, Ono tells Kion to keep on roaring as Beshte pushes rocks onto the Roar's path, holding them in place alongside the water. Having moved the herds to a hill above the field, the others make their way back to Kion.By this point, Kion has begun to tire out from the constant roaring, hoarsely telling Ono he can't hold on much longer. The rest of the Guard arrive and, helping Beshte, move more rocks in the Roar's path. With the rocks in place, Ono tells Kion to stop roaring, allowing the rocks to fall over the hole and block the leak. Turning to the others, Kion thanks them for their help and apologizes for almost causing the flood, having thought he could solve all their problems in his arrogance. However, Kion now knows that nothing can replace the Lion Guard working together as a team, not even the Roar. As Kion realizes they will take the long way around after all, Azaad tells him to not worry, saying the Pride Lands are not far from them. Moving on ahead, the Guard soon come across the plains with a view of the Outlands Volcan, with Azaad declaring they have reached the Outlands. After spotting Pride Rock in the distance, making them all realize they're almost home. However, Kion reminds them they can't stop now: they need to find Zira and stop her. Chanting their catchphrase, the Lion Guard starts the final trek back to the Pride Lands, their home, and the end of their journey. [Return to the Pride Lands](/wiki/Return_to_the_Pride_Lands)[ ] Kion's Guard joins the Night Pride after letting reformed Outsiders become the Pride Lands' newest Lion Guard bringing an end of the role of Kion's Lion Guard in the Pride Lands.
