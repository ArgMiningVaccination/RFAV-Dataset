It kept me motivated throughout 2020. After that, I added a massage membership, and I have enjoyed different therapists -- again, all excellent. One of the newer massage therapists, named Peter, has been incredible at helping my chronic pain issues and releasing old patterns. It has helped my body immeasurably. When the pandemic changed everything, the staff took their yoga offerings online, and those have been just as great. The Soulstice staff also works hard for the community and is active in making massage therapy an essential medical service, so I support these efforts. It certainly is a necessary part of my own healing journey. The therapists are masked, and make it very safe. Every person at Soulstice maintains an enthusiastic, upbeat attitude and each one of them truly cares for the clientele, as if we're family. It's a small place with a very big heart. Get in there and enjoy the highest level of care and community connection. I highly recommend Soulstice Spa! Business owner information Kayse G. 1/11/2021 Amity, we are so grateful for you... your kindness & recognition of our team means the world! Thank you for sharing your experience and being a much-loved part of our community! xoxo. We will get through this difficult time, together, and it is clients like you who inspire our work every day - thank you! - 10/28/2020 It has been almost a year since I was able to get a massage, due to COVID. When Soulstice was finally allowed to open, they reached out to me, to schedule an appointment. I worked with Steph, who was new to me. She was AMAZING! She was attentive to my comfort level, was focused on the therapy, and was totally open to feedback and guidance, during the massage. She wore her mask throughout, as did I, and kept checking in, to ensure that I was comfortable and that the massage was effectively addressing my needs. The procedures for check in were thoroughly explained to me, before arrival, and the front desk staff politely and firmly made sure that I complied with the requirements. They take everyone's safety very seriously. I could not recommend Soulstice, or Steph, enough! Business owner information Kayse G. 10/30/2020 Thank you for your kind review Aram! We're so happy to be back & caring for our community. Thanks for visiting! - 2/15/2021 Peter's body work is exemplary. His presence is quiet, intuitive and mindful. His technique is firm yet soft. With every stroke he uses the entire surface of his strong hands, and fingers.When appropriate his forearms are gracefully employed. He moves slowly, connecting with all of the important muscles and tendons that are the common areas needing touch and release. He is doing magic for minimizing my tension and stressed, overused muscles. He is an integral part of the amazing staff at Soulstice. I highly recommend him! Business owner information Kayse G. 2/16/2021 Thank you Lori! Your thoughtful review means so much to all of us at Soulstice - thank you for being part of our community... grateful for you! - 7/21/2020 Got in a massage right before they got banned again. :( It was magic and I felt safe. The staff was incredibly kind and Peter worked magic on my sore muscles. As soon as they're allowed back open I'll be in to support. Amazing business with caring staff! Business owner information Kayse G. 7/25/2020 So kind! Thank you for your sweet review, Paula - we hope our State and County can return coronavirus cases to 'down-trending status' asap so we can return to caring for you all! We're so happy you felt safe, and look forward to seeing you again, hopefully soon! xxx - 11/3/2019 My husband and I have been looking for local massage therapists that we can see monthly for self-care. After a year of trying out places around Sonoma County we were beginning to think affordable and quality was lost. Post Kincaid fire evac, we needed to get the stress and travel out of our system and decided to give Soulstice a try. 100% rewarded for perseverance! Both Chris and Zoe were professional, intuitive and excellent masseuses. We bought our membership after the massages because we've finally found the spot that cares about its clients and prioritizes quality service. We'll be back every month now ;) - 1/12/2020 Wow.\"%100 perfect. Love the STAFF, the rates, the cleanliness, and the ambience. Fantastic front desk service and telephone management. Fantastic. This beautiful spa is pristine, spacious and modern serene. Amazing overall experience every time. - 2/23/2021Updated review Soulstice is so inviting and a great place for my monthly massage with Nikki. She loosened me up and I left feeling nurtured and relaxed. She in intuitive and reads my body so well. She knows just where to focus her attention.12/2/2020Previous review Always get great service and a fabulous massage with Nikki. Love this place and the people who care so much about my well-being.6/16/2019Previous review Another great massage with Nikki. So relaxing and rejuvenating after a surgery I had a few weeks ago.11/25/2018Previous review I am so pleased that my daughter referred me to Soulstice Spa. Nikki is an amazing practitioner who keys into my body issues and knows just how to work on them. I am so happy to have a monthly membership. - 3/3/2021Updated review My Mom and I have been getting massages at Soulstice Spas for years and love everyone. I have had massages from 4 different masseuses over the years and yesterday was introduced to a new masseuse (new to me), Peter. He was amazing! His hands had a soothing heat to them with a healing energy. From the minute we enter the relaxing spa we feel safe because of the standards that are upheld with cleanliness and distancing. Everyone is masked and the utmost care is taken for the health of everyone. I highly encourage people to spoil yourself while supporting a local small business that has done so much to care for our community. Get a massage! You will love it...12/30/2020Previous review My sister has been giving our 90 year old Mom a monthly massage membership for many years and my gift to our Mom has been scheduling her appointments and driving her so she can just relax. Pre-pandemic she was having a monthly massage with Nicolette who was a perfect match for our Mom. We always feel so cared for and the setting is very relaxing. Nicolette had just the right touch and she left feeling wonderful. After about a year I decided to use my HSA benefits to purchase a membership and started getting my own massage. I have had a couple different masseuses but they were both excellent. We both leave every time feeling like loved marshmallows. The front desk staff loves my Mom and fits us in working with our schedule. They make sure book with the appropriate masseuse to meet our needs. We have never met the owners but they should be very proud of their staff and the environment that they have created and maintained. I highly recommend this spa to everyone I know and now to everyone on Yelp. Post-pandemic they have been able to open as an essential business. They go beyond the Counties health requirements and we feel very safe. After many months of not having our monthly massage it is good to be back. I am loving Sebastian and his magic hands! It is the perfect gift and they have packages on sale until tomorrow with 2020 prices! - 2/26/2021 While the pandemic has interrupted the great yoga and Pilates that was making me stronger, healthier and more grounded, the massage I received from Peter this week was equally beneficial. It felt as if every tight spot and kink was completely gone thanks to his firm yet gentle, deep and sweeping massage. He has healing hands and presence and I will be back. Thank you Peter and caring, courteous staff! Business owner information Kayse G. 3/2/2021 Thank you so much Jennifer! We appreciate your thoughtful, detailed review and happy you enjoyed your visit! We look forward to caring for you again soon. xxx - 11/19/2020 I had an amazing massage with Stephanie. She really understood what I needed and provided much-needed relief to my achy muscles. I would highly recommend getting a massage at Soulstice. In addition to the great massage, the level of service was top notch. From the booking experience to my arrival at the spa to my massage, I was treated extremely well. Thank you for an excellent experience. I will be coming back.
