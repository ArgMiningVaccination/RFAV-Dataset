(2011) 8(4):477 - 482 477 DETERMINATION OF PARAMETERS AFFECTING THE USE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE IN CANCER PATIENTS AND DETECTION OF PREVALENCE OF 2Erzurum State Hospital, Erzurum, Turkey, 3Kayseri State Hospital, Kayseri, Turkey, 4Gazi Medical School, Ankara, Turkey E-mail: mgumus@superonline.com Abstract This study was conducted to find out the frequency of comp lementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use that could lead to troubles in patient health and in applied standard th erapy protocols when used improperly, which method is used, the reasons for use and from which resources the information about this topic were obtained. A questionnaire consisting of 28 questions was applied to 195 patients with cancer diagnosis by a face-to-face interview. The obtained data were assessed with SPSS 11.5 program. Out of 195 cancer patients, 100 (51.3%) were using CAM and 48.7% (n=95) were not. The most commonly used agent was nettle (72%). This was followed by herbal teas (21%), grape molasses (20%) and black seed (20%). The frequency of CAM use was found higher in those under age 50, in literate pe ople, in those working during the diagnosis stage and having disease at the later stage. While CAM was commonly recommended by friends and relatives of the pa tients (73%), this ratio was only 5% for health professionals. While 51.3% of all patients were gathering information about CAM, 75% of those actually using CAM gathered information about it. Whilst information was gathered mostly from the relatives of patients and tamperers (47%), it can be gathered from physicians only with a ratio of 10%. Cancer patients use CAM and they gather information mainly from unreliable sources rather than physicians. Although the primary information source should be physicians, the ratio for thi s was very low (10%). We suggest that physicians should spend mo re time in gathering correct information and sharing them with their patients for a better guidance. Keywords: Complementary medicine, alternative medicine, complementary therapies, cancer. Introduct on Even though rapid developments occur in cancer therapy, because the therapy continues for a long time, the success rates are still low with uncertainty and desperation, cancer pa tients can tend to choose methods other than medical care. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is used very commonly among the cancer patients. In recent studies, it was shown that one third of these patients have been using CAM (E rnst and Cassileth, 1998). The reasons for using CAM are to provide a support to the applied therapy, prevent the recurrence of the disease, increase the quality of life, support the immu ne system and increase survival (Henderson and Donatelle. 2004, Richardson et al. 2000, Shen et al. 2002). The frequency of CAM use demonstrates difference in terms of th e primary disease and the country. In a study performed in patients with breast cance r, CAM use was 20% in Canada (Gray et al. 2003), 22.4% in Englan d ( Rees et al. 2000), and more than 60% in the United States (Ashikaga et al. 2002, VandeCreek et al. 1998). On the other hand, CAM use in patients with breast cancer was 44.7% and it was 32% in patients with colorectal cancer (Molassiotis et al. 2006, Molassiotis et al. 2005). This study was conducted to describ e CAM use in Turkey because of the differences in CAM use betwee n countries in the literature. Furthermore, studies about CAM use are not sufficient in order to reinforce the results of the data obtained from the previous studies and to reveal how often the patients use CAM and their reasons for use. Mater al and Methods A questionnaire consisting of 28 questions was applied to 195 patients with cancer diagnosis in the Department of Radiation Oncology, Dr. L\u00fctfi K rdar Kartal Training and Research Hospital and in the Department of Radiation Oncology, Gazi doi: 10.4314/ajtcam.v8i4.21Mayadagli et al., Afr J Tradit Complement Altern Med. (2011) 8(4):477 - 482 478 University Faculty of Medicine. A questionnaire prepared by our institute review committee was applied. The questionnaire was applied by a physician in a face-to face interview. The questions were mainly directed to reveal socio-demographic characterist ics of the patients (Table 1), reasons for use of CAM and the information source. The obtained data were assessed in SPSS 11.5 program. Results Hundred and seven (54.9%) patients were males and 88 (45.1% ) were females. The median age was 56 years (range 15- 96). In terms of pathological diagnosis, the largest group cons isted of patients with pulmonary cancer (n=49, 25.1%), followed by those with gastrointestinal system cancer (n=33, 16.9%) and brea st cancer (n=33, 16.9%) (Table 2). Fifty-one point three percen t of the patients (n=100) were using CAM, whereas 48.7% (n=95) of them were not. Nettle was used most commonly (72%). This was followed by herbal teas (21%), grape molasses (20%) and black seed (20%) (Table 3). The use of CAM was found similar in both males and females. CAM use was detected more in the younger ages. While CAM use is 62.4% for patients younger than 50 years old, it was 46.5% in those above 50 years (p=0.02). The educational level was decisive in the use of CAM. While the use of CAM was 33.35% in illiterate people, it was 53.4% in literate ones (P=0.06). The use of CAM was found higher in patients actively working du ring disease period compared to those who did not work (64.9% vs 48.1%, p=0.04). CAM use was found higher in those with advanced disease compared to those with early disease. But, this did not translate into a statistical significance (p=0.07). The frequency for CAM use in terms of socio-demographic characteristics of the patients is given in table 4. CAM was recommended to 38% of the patients by friends, 35% of them by the relatives and 1% by the auxiliary health professionals (Figure 1). Eleven percent of patients using CAM did not want to use it but forced by their families whereas 5% o f these patients wanted to use it but reject ed by their families. While 69% of the patients using CAM have thought that it is beneficial, 49% of them stated that they had benefits from CAM. Fifteen percent of patients using CAM were worried that the substance they used would disrupt their health and undesirable side effects were seen in 8% of the patients. While 5% of the patients used CAM because they did not benefit from the medica l therapies, 95% of them used CAM as supplement to medical therapies. While 51.3% of all patients (n=195) were attempted to gath er information about CAM, 75% of the patients using CAM (n=100) endeavored for it. Information about CAM was obtained from relatives (27%), tamperer s (20%), television (11%), internet and books (5%) (Figure 2). Dscuss on In this study, 51.3% of 195 patients (n=100) were found to use CAM. Although this number was found similar in several studies (Molassiotis et al. 2006, Paltiel et al. 2001), th ere are other studies showing lo wer CAM use (Wyatt et al. 199 9, Pud et al. 2005, Molassiotis et al. 2006b). Socio-cultural characteri stics and life-style of people are seen as primary factors responsible for these variations in the results of these st udies (Pud et al. 2005). In the multinational study conducted by Molassiotis involving patients with breast cancer, it was seen that the use of CAM showed significant differences among differe nt countries. The use of CAM was most common in Italy (73.3% ) and least common in Greece (1 5.8%). CAM use was 58.3% in Turkey (Molassiotis et al. 2005) . The mean incidence of CAM use was found as 31. 4% in a review of previous international studies done in 13 countries (Ernst and Cassileth, 1998). Beside the cultural differences, the primary region where the disease has begun was one of the factors affecting the use of CAM. The fre quencies of CAM use for lung disease, for colorectal disease (Molassiotis et al. 2005) and for patients with breast cancer (M olassiotis et al. 2006b) were reported as 23.6%, 32% and 44.7%, respectively. In the studies conducted until now, herbal therapies have been the most commonly applied CAM method Molassiotis et al. 2006, Molassiotis et al. 2005, Pud et al. 2005). The type of the disease, the stage of the disease and the presence of the symptoms were determinant in CAM use. While the patients in advanced stage use religious and relaxing therapies, the patients in earlier stage use homeopathy and acupuncture. Furthermore, cult ural state, environment, customs and the religious beliefs were also determinant factors in CAM use (Pud et al. 2005). In an Is raeli study, religious, herbal and relaxation therapies were mor e common (Pud et al. 2005) whereas in other studie s, homeopathy (Bernstein et al. 1996, Kitai et al. 1998) or acupuncture and shiatsu were used more commonly (Soffer et al. 2001). doi: 10.4314/ajtcam.v8i4.21Mayadagli et al., Afr J Tradit Complement Altern Med.

(2011) 8(4):477 - 482 481 Figure 1: The source of recommendation for CAM use Figure 2: The resources used by the CAM using patients to gather information In our study, herbal therapies were most commonly used. Am ong the herbal therapies, nettle was (72%) in the first rank. However, although it was less often, carob (11%) or donkey m ilk was noticeable. Physicians must spend more time with their patients to prevent them desperately choose unacceptable CAM methods. The use of CAM was found higher in young patients and in those with higher educational level (Bernstein et al. 1996 , Soffer et al. 2001, Azaz-Livshits T et al. 2002). Considerin g more active life style of young patients with higher education and their ability to reach information easily, higher frequency of CAM use can be explained. In our study, we also found higher CAM use in young patients with higher education when compared to illiterate patients, working patients and patients with later-stage disease. There are physical and social factors that lead the cancer patients to use CAM. These causative factors are to sup port the body in fighting with ca ncer (Molassiotis et al. 2006, Molassiotis et al. 2005), to increase the expectation of the patient (Richardson et al. 2000), the fact that the applied medical therapy does not meet the expectations, the feeling of desperation and the fact that the patient does not trust to his or her p hysician completely (Paltiel et al. 2001). Reports indicating that therapies with herbal and animal origin negatively affect the activity of the medical therapy have been presented. Furthermore, toxicities of herbal therapies have been reported (Ernst, 2000). The side effects were reported as 2.1% (Molassiotis et al. 2005, Molassiotis et al. 2006b) or 25 % in a different study (Pud et al. 2005). In two studies by Molassiotis (Molassiotis et al. 2005, Molass iotis et al. 2006b) 4.3% and 6.5% of the patients reported that they had no benefit s from CAM. On the other hand, while 40% of the patients using CAM were thinking that they had improvement in their health, 34.3% of them thought that they had improvement in their phys ical health (Pud et al. 2005). It was noticed that patients using doi: 10.4314/ajtcam.v8i4.21Mayadagli et al., Afr J Tradit Complement Altern Med. (2011) 8(4):477 - 482 482 CAM were more optimistic than those that do not use CAM (Wyatt et al. 1999). In our study, while 69% of the patients using CAM thought that it is beneficial , 49% of them stated that they received bene fits. While 15% of the patients using CAM were worrying that the used substance will disrupt their health, side effects developed in 8% of them. In the majority of the studie s done, the information is received most commonly from friends, from media and from family. The role of the physicians is quite low in this sense (17.9%, 12.5%) (Molassi otis et al. 2005, Molassiotis et al. 2006b). In our study, only 10% of the patients go t information from their physicians, 5% of them used CAM with the advice of physicians. Nevertheless, because most of the information were received from the friends and the relatives. It was evident that that the information about this topic is not sufficient. In conclusion, we found that more than a half of the pa tients use CAM and only 10% of them get information from physicians. Because the CAM method used by the patients negative ly affect medical therapy, it is very important to manage thes e patients correctly. Physicians must give appropriate e xplanations that will meet the needs of the patients. References 1. Ashikaga T, Bosompra K, O'Brien P, Nelson L (2002).
