The lower of the following amounts: The actual fee the provider, facility, or vendor charged for the Service. 160 percent of the Medicare fee for the Service, as indicated by the applicable Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code or Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code shown on the current Medicare fee schedule. The Medicare fee schedule is developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and adjusted by Medicare geographical practice indexes. When there is no established CPT or HCPCS code indicating the Medicare fee for a particular Service, the Allowed Amount is 70 percent of the actual fee the provider, facility, or vendor charged for the Service. Ancillary Service. Services that are: Related to emergency medicine, anesthesiology, pathology, radiology, and neonatology, whether provided by a physician or non-physician practitioner. Provided by assistant surgeons, hospitalists, and intensivists. Diagnostic Services, including radiology and laboratory Services. Provided by a Non-Participating Provider if there is no Participating Provider who can furnish such Service at the facility. Provided as a result of unforeseen, urgent medical needs that arise at the time the Service is provided, regardless of whether the Non-Participating Provider or Non-Participating Facility satisfies the notice and consent requirements under federal law. Behavioral Health Assessment. Behavioral Health Assessment means an evaluation in person or using telemedicine, to determine a patient's need for immediate crisis stabilization, by a provider as listed in the \"Mental Health Services\" section. Behavioral Health Crisis. Behavioral Health Crisis means a disruption in an individual's mental or emotional stability or functioning resulting in an urgent need for immediate outpatient treatment in an emergency department or admission to a hospital to prevent a serious deterioration in the individual's mental or physical health.

Charges means the following: For Services provided by Medical Group and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, the amount in Company's schedule of Medical Group and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals charges for Services provided to Members. For Services for which a provider or facility (other than Medical Group or Kaiser Foundation Hospitals) is compensated on a capitation basis, the amount in the schedule of charges that Company negotiates with the capitated provider. For Services received from other Participating Providers or Participating Facilities we contract with, the amount the provider or facility has agreed to accept as payment. For items obtained at a pharmacy owned and operated by Kaiser Permanente, the amount the pharmacy would charge a Member for the item if the Member's benefit Plan did not cover the pharmacy item. This amount is an estimate of: the cost of acquiring, storing, and dispensing drugs, the direct and indirect costs of providing pharmacy Services to Members, and the pharmacy program's contribution to the net revenue requirements of Company.EOIDDED0123 3 OM-OVVXFor Emergency Services received from a Non-Participating Provider or Non-Participating Facility (including Post-Stabilization Care that constitutes Emergency Services under federal law), the amount required to be paid by Company pursuant to state law, when it is applicable, or federal law, including any amount determined through negotiation or an independent dispute resolution (IDR) process.

About Our Drug Formulary Our drug formulary is a list of drugs that our Regional Formulary and Therapeutics Committee has reviewed and approved for our Members and includes drugs covered under this EOC. Drugs on the formulary have been approved by the FDA. Our Regional Formulary and Therapeutics Committee is made up of Participating Physicians, other Participating Providers, and administrative staff. The committee chooses drugs for the formulary based on several factors, including safety and effectiveness as determined from a review of the scientific literature. They may not approve a drug if there is not enough scientific evidence that it is clinically effective. They may also exclude a drug if it does not have a clinical or cost advantage over comparable formulary drugs. The Regional Formulary and Therapeutics Committee meets to review new drugs and reconsider drugs currently on the market. After this review, they may add drugs to the formulary or remove drugs from it. If a drug is removed from the formulary, you will need to switch to another comparable drug that is on the drug formulary, unless your old drug meets exception criteria. Refer to the \"Drug Formulary Exception Process\" in this \"Outpatient Prescription Drugs and Supplies\" section for more information. If a formulary change affects a prescription drug you are taking, we encourage you to discuss any questions or concerns with your Participating Provider or another member of your health care team. Drugs on our formulary may move to a different drug tier during the Year. For example, a drug could move from the Non-Preferred Brand-Name Drug list to the Preferred Brand-Name Drug list. If a drug you are taking is moved to a different drug tier, this could change the Cost Share you pay for that drug. To see if a drug or supply is on our drug formulary, or to find out what drug tier the drug is in, go online to kp.org/formulary.

This exclusion does not apply to Services that are covered under \"Preventive Care Services\" in the \"Benefits\" section. REDUCTIONS Coordination of Benefits The Coordination of Benefits (COB) provision applies when a person has health care coverage under more than one Plan. Plan is defined below. The order of benefit determination rules governs the order in which each Plan will pay a claim for benefits. The Plan that pays first is called the Primary Plan. The Primary Plan must pay benefits in accordance with its policy terms without regard to the possibility that another Plan may cover some expenses. The Plan that pays after the Primary Plan is the Secondary Plan. The Secondary Plan may reduce the benefits it pays so that payments from all Plans do not exceed 100 percent of the total Allowable expense. Definitions A. A Plan is any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical or dental care or treatment. If separate contracts are used to provide coordinated coverage for members of a group, the separate contracts are considered parts of the same Plan and there is no COB among those separate contracts. (1) Plan includes: group and individual health insurance contracts, health maintenance organization (HMO) contracts, group or individual closed panel Plans, other forms of group or group-type coverage (whether insured or uninsured); medical care components of group long-term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care; Medicare or any other federal governmental Plan, as permitted by law; and group and individual insurance contracts and subscriber contracts that pay or reimburse for the cost of dental care.EOIDDED0123 53 OM-OVVX(2) Plan does not include: independent, non-coordinated hospital indemnity coverage or other fixed indemnity coverage; accident only coverage; specified disease or specified accident coverage; school accident type coverage; benefits for non-medical components of group long-term care policies; Medicare supplement policies; Medicaid policies; or coverage under other federal governmental Plans, unless permitted by law. Each contract for coverage under (1) or (2) is a separate Plan. If a Plan has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is treated as a separate Plan. B. This Plan means, in a COB provision, the part of the contract providing the health care benefits to which the COB provision applies and which may be reduced because of the benefits of other Plans. Any other part of the contract providing health care benefits is separate from This Plan. A contract may apply one COB provision to certain benefits, such as dental benefits, coordinating only with similar benefits, and may apply another COB provision to coordinate other benefits. C. The order of benefit determination rules determines whether This Plan is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan when the person has health care coverage under more than one Plan. When This Plan is primary, it determines payment for its benefits first before those of any other Plan without considering any other Plan's benefits. When This Plan is secondary, it determines its benefits after those of another Plan and may reduce the benefits it pays so that all Plan benefits do not exceed 100 percent of the total Allowable expense. D. Allowable expense is a health care expense, including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments, that is covered at least in part by any Plan covering the person. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of Services, the reasonable cash value of each service will be considered an Allowable expense and a benefit paid. An expense that is not covered by any Plan covering the person is not an Allowable expense. In addition, any expense that a provider by law or in accordance with a contractual agreement is prohibited from charging a covered person is not an Allowable expense. The following are examples of expenses that are not Allowable expenses: (1) The difference between the cost of a semi-private hospital room and a private hospital room is not an Allowable expense, unless one of the Plans provides coverage for private hospital room expenses. (2) If a person is covered by two or more Plans that compute their benefit payments on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement methodology or other similar reimbursement methodology, any amount in excess of the highest reimbursement amount for a specific benefit is not an Allowable expense. (3) If a person is covered by two or more Plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, an amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated fees is not an Allowable expense. (4) If a person is covered by one Plan that calculates its benefits or services on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement methodology or other similar reimbursement methodology and another Plan that provides its benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, the Primary Plan's payment arrangement shall be the Allowable expense for all Plans. However, if the provider has contracted with the Secondary Plan to provide the benefit or service for a specific negotiated fee or payment amount that is different than the Primary Plan's payment arrangement and if the provider's contract permits, the negotiated fee or payment shall be the Allowable expense used by the Secondary Plan to determine its benefits. (5) The amount of any benefit reduction by the Primary Plan because a covered person has failed to comply with the Plan provisions is not an Allowable expense. Examples of these types of Plan provisions include second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions, and preferred provider arrangements.EOIDDED0123 54 OM-OVVXE. Closed panel Plan is a Plan that provides health care benefits to covered persons primarily in the form of services through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the Plan, and that excludes coverage for services provided by other providers, except in cases of emergency or referral by a panel member. F. Custodial parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year excluding any temporary visitation. Order of Benefit Determination Rules When a person is covered by two or more Plans, the rules for determining the order of benefit payments are as follows: A. The Primary Plan pays or provides its benefits according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benefits of under any other Plan. B. (1) Except as provided in Paragraph (2), a Plan that does not contain a coordination of benefits provision that is consistent with this regulation is always primary unless the provisions of both Plans state that the complying Plan is primary. (2) Coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits and provides that this supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. Examples of these types of situations are major medical coverages that are superimposed over base plan hospital and surgical benefits, and insurance type coverages that are written in connection with a Closed panel Plan to provide out-of-network benefits. C. A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in calculating payment of its benefits only when it is secondary to that other Plan. D. Each Plan determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules that apply: (1) Non-Dependent or Dependent. The Plan that covers the person other than as a dependent, for example as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan and the Plan that covers the person as a dependent is the Secondary Plan. However, if the person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is secondary to the Plan covering the person as a dependent; and primary to the Plan covering the person as other than a dependent (e.g. a retired employee); then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering the person as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree is the Secondary Plan and the other Plan is the Primary plan. (2) Dependent child covered under more than one Plan. Unless there is a court decree stating otherwise, when a dependent child is covered by more than one Plan the order of benefits is determined as follows: (a) For a dependent child whose parents are married or are living together, whether or not they have ever been married: (i) The Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year is the Primary Plan; or (ii) If both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the Primary Plan. (b) For a dependent child whose parents are divorced or separated or not living together, whether or not they have ever been married: (i) If a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual EOIDDED0123 55 OM-OVVXknowledge of those terms, that Plan is primary. This rule applies to plan years commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree; (ii) If a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the provisions of subparagraph (a) above shall determine the order of benefits; (iii) If a court decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the dependent child, the provisions of subparagraph (a) above shall determine the order of benefits; or (iv) If there is no court decree allocating responsibility for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benefits for the child are as follows: 1. The Plan covering the Custodial parent; 2. The Plan covering the spouse of the Custodial parent; 3. The Plan covering the non-custodial parent; and then 4. The Plan covering the spouse of the non-custodial parent. (c) For a dependent child covered under more than one Plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the provisions of subparagraph (a) or (b) above shall determine the order of benefits as if those individuals were the parents of the child. (d) For a dependent child: (i) Who has coverage under either or both parents' plans and also has coverage as a dependent under a spouse's plan, the rule in paragraph (5) applies. (ii) In the event the dependent child's coverage under the spouse's plan began on the same date as the dependent child's coverage under either or both parents' plans, the order of benefits shall be determined by applying the birthday rule in subparagraph (a) to the dependent child's parent and the dependent's spouse. (3) Active employee or retired or laid-off employee. The Plan that covers a person as an active employee, that is, an employee who is neither laid-off nor retired, is the Primary Plan. The Plan covering that same person as a retired or laid-off employee is the Secondary Plan. The same would hold true if a person is a dependent of an active employee and that same person is a dependent of a retired or laid- off employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the rule labeled D(1) can determine the order of benefits. (4) COBRA or state continuation coverage. If a person whose coverage is provided pursuant to COBRA or under a right of continuation provided by state or other federal law is covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree or covering the person as a dependent of an employee, member, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan and the COBRA or state or other federal continuation coverage is the Secondary Plan. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the rule labeled D(1) can determine the order of benefits. (5) Longer or shorter length of coverage. The Plan that covered the person as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree longer is the Primary Plan and the Plan that covered the person the shorter period of time is the Secondary Plan. (6) If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benefits, the Allowable expenses shall be shared equally between the Plans meeting the definition of Plan. In addition, This Plan will not pay more than it would have paid had it been the Primary Plan.EOIDDED0123 56 OM-OVVXEffect on the Benefits of This Plan A. When This Plan is secondary, it may reduce its benefits so that the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans during a Plan year are not more than the total Allowable expenses. In determining the amount to be paid for any claim, the Secondary Plan will calculate the benefits it would have paid in the absence of other health care coverage and apply that calculated amount to any Allowable expense under its Plan that is unpaid by the Primary Plan. The Secondary Plan may then reduce its payment by the amount so that, when combined with the amount paid by the Primary Plan, the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans for the claim do not exceed the total Allowable expense for that claim. In addition, the Secondary Plan shall credit to its Plan deductible any amounts it would have credited to its deductible in the absence of other health care coverage. B. If a covered person is enrolled in two or more Closed panel Plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of service by a non-panel provider, benefits are not payable by one Closed panel Plan, COB shall not apply between that Plan and other Closed panel Plans. Right to Receive and Release Needed Information Certain facts about health care coverage and services are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benefits payable under This Plan and other Plans. We may get the facts we need from or give them to other organizations or persons for the purpose of applying these rules and determining benefits payable under This Plan and other Plans covering the person claiming benefits. We need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under This Plan must give us any facts we need to apply those rules and determine benefits payable. Facility of Payment A payment made under another Plan may include an amount that should have been paid under This Plan. If it does, it may pay that amount to the organization that made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under This Plan. This Plan will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means the reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services. Right of Recovery If the amount of the payments made by This Plan is more than it should have paid under this COB provision, This Plan may recover the excess from one or more of the persons it has paid or for whom it has paid; or any other person or organization that may be responsible for the benefits or services provided for the covered person. The \"amount of the payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services. Questions About Coordination of Benefits?

Injuries or Illnesses Alleged to be Caused by Other Parties or Covered by No-Fault Insurance This \"Injuries or Illnesses Alleged to be Caused by Other Parties or Covered by No-Fault Insurance\" section applies if you receive covered Services for an injury or illness alleged to be any of the following: Caused by another party's act or omission.EOIDDED0123 57 OM-OVVXReceived on the premises of another party. Covered by a no-fault insurance provision. For purposes of this section, \"no-fault insurance\" means a type of insurance policy that covers your medical expenses for injury or illness due to an accident, regardless of who caused the accident. Subject to applicable law, if you obtain a settlement, award, or judgment from or on behalf of another party or insurer, or a payment under a no-fault insurance provision, you must ensure we are reimbursed for covered Services that you receive for the injury or illness. This \"Injuries or Illnesses Alleged to be Caused by Other Parties or Covered by No-Fault Insurance\" section does not affect your obligation to pay any applicable Deductible, Copayment, or Coinsurance for these covered Services. The amount of reimbursement due to the Plan is not limited by or subject to the Out-of-Pocket Maximum provision. If you do not recover anything from or on behalf of the other party, or no-fault insurance, then you are responsible only for any applicable Deductible, Copayment, or Coinsurance payments. To the extent permitted by law, we have the option of becoming subrogated to all claims, causes of action, and other rights you may have against another party or an insurer, government program, or other source of coverage for monetary damages, compensation, or indemnification on account of the injury or illness allegedly caused by another party. We will be so subrogated as of the time we mail or deliver a written notice of our exercise of this option to you or your attorney, but we will be subrogated only to the extent of the total Charges for the relevant covered Services. To secure our rights, we will have a lien on the proceeds of any judgment, award, or settlement you or we (when we subrogate) obtain against another party, regardless of how those proceeds may be characterized or designated. Subject to applicable law, the proceeds of any judgment, award, or settlement that you or we obtain shall first be applied to satisfy our lien, regardless of whether the total amount of the proceeds is less than the actual losses and damages you incurred. Within 30 days after submitting or filing a claim or legal action against another party, or any insurer, you must send written notice of the claim or legal action to us at: Equian, LLC Attn: 40233 Fax: 502-214-1291 In order for us to determine the existence of any rights we may have and to satisfy those rights, you must complete and send to us all consents, releases, trust agreements, authorizations, assignments, and other documents, including lien forms directing your attorney, the responsible party, and the responsible party's insurer to pay us directly. You must not take any action prejudicial to our rights. You must provide us written notice before you settle a claim or obtain a judgment or award, or if it appears you will make a recovery of any kind. Subject to applicable law, if you recover any amounts from another party or any insurer based on your injury or illness, you must pay us or place the funds in a specifically identifiable account and retain control over the recovered amounts to which we may assert a right. In addition to the rights set forth above, we shall also be entitled to all of the remedies, benefits, and other rights of sections 742.520 - 742.544, Oregon Revised Statutes. If your estate, parent, guardian, or conservator asserts a claim against another party or any insurer based on your injury or illness, any settlement or judgment recovered shall be subject to our liens and other rights to the same extent as if you had asserted the claim against the other party. We may assign our rights to enforce our liens and other rights.EOIDDED0123 58 OM-OVVXSurrogacy Arrangements - Traditional and Gestational Carriers If you enter into a Surrogacy Arrangement, whether traditional or gestational, you must ensure we are reimbursed for covered Services you receive related to conception, pregnancy, delivery, or postpartum care in connection with that arrangement (\"Surrogacy Health Services\"), except that the amount we collect will not exceed the payments or other compensation you and any other payee are entitled to receive under the Surrogacy Arrangement.

After you surrender a baby to the legal parents, you are not obligated to pay Charges for any Services that the baby receives (the legal parents are financially responsible for any Services that the baby receives). By accepting Surrogacy Health Services, you automatically assign to us your right to receive payments that are payable to you or any other payee under the Surrogacy Arrangement, regardless of whether those payments are characterized as being for medical expenses. To secure our rights, we will also have a lien on those payments and on any escrow account, trust, or any other account that holds those payments. Those payments (and amounts in any escrow account, trust, or other account that holds those payments) shall first be applied to satisfy our lien. The assignment and our lien will not exceed the total amount of your obligation to us under the preceding paragraph. Within 30 days after entering into a Surrogacy Arrangement, you must send written notice of the arrangement, including all of the following information: Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the other parties to the arrangement Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of any escrow agent or trustee Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the intended parents and any other parties who are financially responsible for Services the baby (or babies) receive, including names, addresses, and telephone numbers for any health insurance that will cover Services that the baby (or babies) receive A signed copy of any contracts and other documents explaining the arrangement Any other information we request in order to satisfy our rights You must send this information to: Surrogacy Other Party Liability Supervisor 40233-6380 Fax: 1-502-214-1137 must complete and send us all consents, releases, authorizations, lien forms, and other documents that are reasonably necessary for us to determine the existence of any rights we may have under this \"Surrogacy Arrangements - Traditional and Gestational Carriers\" section and to satisfy those rights.

In addition, there is a separate appeals procedure for adverse benefit determinations due to a retroactive termination of membership (rescission). Pre-service Claims and Appeals Pre-service claims are requests that we provide or pay for a Service that you have not yet received. Failure to receive authorization before receiving a Service that must be authorized or pre-certified in order to be a covered benefit may be the basis for our denial of your pre-service claim or a post-service claim for payment. If you receive any of the Services you are requesting before we make our decision, your pre-service claim or appeal will become a post-service claim or appeal with respect to those Services. If you have any general questions about pre-service claims or appeals, please call Member Services. Here are the procedures for filing a non-urgent pre-service claim, an urgent pre-service claim, a non-urgent pre-service appeal, and an urgent pre-service appeal. Non-Urgent Pre-service Claim You may request a pre-service benefit determination on your own behalf.
