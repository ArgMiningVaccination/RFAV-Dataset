Introduction This report conducts a further review of medical literature on the efficacy and effectiveness of medical nutriti on therapy for certain diseases . Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is comprised of the assessment of nutritional status an d the provision of nutritional counseling by a license d dietitian or nutritional prof essional. The first review of medical literature regard ing MNT was conducted by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). In 2000, they published the report, \"The Role of Nutrition in Maintaining Health in the Nation's Elderly\" that outlined the medical literature they found concerning the use of MNT for undernutrition, cardiovascular diseas e, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, and osteoporosis. IOM recommended that MNT should be covered by the Medicare program for the five conditions identified in its repo rt; it should be provided by a dietitian or qualified nutrition professional; and that ente ral and parenteral nutri tion-related services continue to be a covered benefit. When Congress made MNT provided by a qualif ied dietitian or nut rition professional a Medicare benefit, they sele cted two of the diseases re viewed in the IOM report for coverage: diabetes and renal disease, and required that DHHS make recommendations for extending coverage for nutriti onal assessment and counseling to other diseases. Our literature search for any articles regardi ng nutrition assessment and counseling was done on PubMed, a comprehensive listing of all availa ble medical literature. In evaluating that literature, we ranked the liter ature from the highest, thos e that described randomized controlled trials to the lowest , editorials or articles base d on anecdotal information. The ranking of the medical literature is based on the quality of the study using standards accepted in the scientific community and how well the findings will apply to the Medicare population. In our current review, we found the same literatu re that was identified in the IOM report. Therefore, our review follows the same pattern as the IOM report. Enteral and parenteral nutrition or the types of nutrition professionals are not covered in this report, however, because the statute only directed us to make recommendations regarding MNT or nutritional assessment and c ounseling. We also review ed the use of nutritional assessment and counseling in dialysis centers in response to a subs equent Congressional request. Page 2 II. Summary of Findings We conducted an exhaustive medical literature search to determine the availability of literature about nutrition thera py for different diseases and found literature concerning the same diseases outlined in the IOM report. Cardiovascular disease is divided into hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and heart failure as it is in the IOM re port. The literature for undernutrition focused almost exclusively on enteral and parenteral nutrition and was therefore, excluded from this review because the purpose of this report is to review the evidence regarding MNT. However, in respons e to interest from the American Dietetic Association, we did review the provision of MNT for cancer patients with undernutrition. At the request of Congress, we have incl uded a review of nutritional assessment and counseling in dialysis centers. Our analys is and findings are base d solely on the quality and amount of supportive evidence found in our medical literature search. Our review suggests that there may be a bene fit resulting from diet ary modification using medical nutrition therapy for patients with hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Supportive studies were not found for patients with hear t failure. We evaluated the nature of the interventions (counseling sessions) and outcomes (dietary m odification and the effect on the symptoms of disease) in each of the st udies. A large number of randomly controlled trials using dietitians or nutri tionists demonstrated that diet ary modification was effective in treating hyperlipidemia and hypertension. However, the studies were not designed to show if dietitian/nutritionist interventions were more effective than interventions provided by physicians during o ffice visits. Two articles did state that there was evidence that dietary modification may be mo re successful when patients are counseled by dietitians/nutritionists (medi cal nutrition therapy) in ad dition to receiving dietary counseling routinely provided in physician office visits. We did not find supportive evidence for dietary modification in the trea tment of osteoporosis or undernutrition for cancer patients in the medical literature. Our research into the adequacy of MNT provi ded in renal dialysis centers found that the MNT provided in that setting was comparab le to the MNT provided under the fee-for- service benefit. The American Dietetic Association di d provide comments to DHHS. They recommended that the MNT benefit be expande d (to cardiovascular disease, malnutrition, pharmacoptherapy), and that DHHS be given th e authority to further expand the benefit under the national coverage determination proc ess. They also made a recommendation regarding reimbursement for MNT whic h is not covered in this report. II. Background Section 4108 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included a provision that required the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to contract with National Academy of Sciences to examine the benefits and costs associated with Page 3 extending Medicare coverage for some preven tive services including MNT. As a result of that study, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, \"The Role of Nutrition in Maintaining Health in the Nation's Elderl y\" was published in 2000. The report examined the use of MNT for managing disease in benefi ciaries with undernut rition, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, and osteoporosis. It recommended that MNT should be a reimbursable benefit fo r Medicare beneficiaries. Effective January 1, 2002, Congress crea ted a Medicare benefit for MNT for beneficiaries with diabetes or a renal disease (except for those receiving dialysis) in section 105 of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA). MNT services are defined in stat ute as \"nutritional di agnostic, therapy, and counseling services for the purpose of disease management which are furnished by a registered dietitian or nutrition professional ... pursuant to a referral by a physician...\" The benefit is further defined in CMS's final rule dated November 1, 2001 (CMS-1169-FC), as face-to-face nutritional assessment s and interventions in accordance with nationally accepted dietary or nutritional protocols. (The protocols currently recognized by CMS as nationally accepted are the protoc ols developed by the American Dietetic Association and the National Kidney Foundation.) Enrollment of dietitians/nutri tionists as a new provider group started in December of 2001 and Medicare contractors started paying Me dicare claims for MN T for diabetes and renal disease for services provided on or after January 1, 2002, the statutory effective date. BIPA also required the Secretary of the DHHS to recommend expansions of the MNT benefit to other Medicare beneficiary populat ions by July 1, 2003. This report fulfills that mandate. We also have included the re sults of our study of the adequacy of MNT provided to dialysis patients. III. Diseases Reviewed A. Undernutrition The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, \"The Role of Nutrition in Maintaining Health in the Nation's Elderly\"1 TP discusses undernutrition in terms of markers and syndromes. The markers they note are: Weight loss and morphometric measures of undernutrition, Poor nutritional intake, and Biochemical markers of malnutrition (a lbumin, transferrin, retinol binding protein).2 1 Institute of Medicine, The Role of Nutrition in Maintaining Health in the Nation's Elderly , Washington, D.C.:National Academy Press;2000, pp. 65-92. 2 Ibid. Page 4 The syndromes noted are: Body composition changes with aging or sarcopenia, Cachexia, Wasting, Protein-energy undernutrition, and 3 Failure to thrive. TP All of these conditions except for poor nutritional intake ar e not specific for undernutrition. They are symptoms of disease states such as cancer. In this report, we will focus on undernutrition for patients with cancer. Malnutrition may be defined as a condition caused by inadequate intake or inadequate digestion of nutrients. It is a general term that indicates a lack of some or all nutritional elements, and may occur with various conditions, especially digestive conditions, malignancies and chronic infections. Ma lnutrition may range from mild with no symptoms to severe with considerable detriment to health. In cancer, diet and nutrition play important roles in prevention and the subsequent treatments. Since dietary recommendations fo r cancer prevention are similar to general dietary recommendations, we will focus on malnutrition and nutrition services for patients diagnosed with cancer. Since weight loss and malnutrition are fairly common in patients with cancer due to the nature of th e disease and treatments, weight loss may be considered a surogate marker for malnutrition in some instances. It has been reported that \"40% of cancer patients are already malnourished, before the onset of any medical or surgical treatment.\" 4 PT As noted earlier, the 2000 Institute of Medici ne (IOM) Report, \"The Role of Nutrition in Maintaining Health in the Nation's Elderly writ ten by the Institute of Medicine is used as a baseline for this report. We define undernutrition as inadequate nutri tion from any cause. Undernutrition markers include weight loss, poor nutritional intake , and biochemical markers of malnutrition (albumin, transferrin, and the reintol binding protein). The weight loss for undernutrition has varying definitions that include th e amount and duration of the weight loss.5 TP ThePT IOM report uses a definition for outpatient settings of 10 pounds in 6 months, 4 to 5 percent of body weight in 1 year, or 7.5 percen t of total weight in 6 months. For nursing home residents the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 mandates the use of Minimum Data Set (MDS) and Resident Assessm ent Protocols (RAPs) to ensure prompt identification and response to problems in nursing home re sidents. The MDS defines undernutrition as weight loss that is greater than or equal to 5 percent of body weight in 3 Ibid. 4 Cohen and Lefor, 2001. 5 Ibid. Page 5 the past month or greater than or equa l to 10 percent in the last 6 months.6 Involuntary weight loss is associated with an increased risk of mortality.7 The report also notes however, that no randomized clin ical trial data had evaluate d any relationships between nutrition therapy and bett er health outcomes. Poor nutritional intake is defined as average or usual intake of se rvings of food groups, nutrients, or energy below recommended am ounts. The IOM report states that poor nutritional intake is between 66 and 75 per cent of the Recommended Dietary Allowance.8 Poor nutrient intake for patie nts translates into higher ra tes of in-hospital and 90-day mortality.9 As individuals age, nutritional assessment methods may be affected. Notable changes take place in body composition that also a ffect the nutrient requirements of older individuals. Not all changes have b een shown to have a relationship with undernutrition. 10 However, wasting is a direct result of poor dietary intake that re sults in weight loss.11 Wasting is a clinically observed in patients with marasmus, cancer, advanced AIDS with opportunistic infection, critical illness without nutrition suppor t, and chronic organ failure syndromes such as renal failure. 12 Treatment of wasting has focused on supplementing nutrient intake and drug therapy to stimulate appetite. However, the wasting and inability to accumulate lean body mass appears to be a result of the underlying disease process, not from poor dietary intake.13 Protein-energy undernutri tion or PEU is defined by conditions like wasting and by biochemical ma rkers such as albumin. Prealbumin has been shown to be of value in predicting mortality of patients in nursing homes. Treatment of PEU has focused on improving nutri tional intake but ther e is no evidence to support this practice. The IOM report notes that undernutrition is very common among hospitalized and nursing home residents. However, there is no evidence that the unde rnutrition resulting from aging and disease processes can be effectively treated with nutri tion therapy or that increased normal nutrient intake (not enteral or parenteral nutrition) would be effective 6 Ibid. 7 Wallace JI, Schwarts RS, LaCroix AZ, Uhlmann RF, Pearlman RA, \"Involuntary weight loss in older outpatients: Incidence and clinical signifi cance.\" J Am Geriatr Soc 1995;43:329-337. 8 Institute of Medicine, The Role of Nutrition in Maintaining Health in the Nation's Elderly , Washington, D.C.:National Academy Press;2000, pp. 65-92. 9 Sullivan, \"Protein-energ undernutrition among elderl y hospitalized patients: A prospective study.\" J Am Med Assoc 1999;47:710-715. 10 Baumgartner, et al., \"Epidemiology of sarcopenia among the elderly in New Mexico.\" Am J Epidemiol 1998;147:755-763. 11 Institute of Medicine, The Role of Nutrition in Maintaining Health in the Nation's Elderly , Washington, D.C.:National Academy Press;2000, pp. 65-92. 12 Roubenoff, et al., \"Standardization of nomenclature of body composition in weight loss.\" Am J Clin Nutr 1997;66:192-1966. 13 Institute of Medicine, The Role of Nutrition in Maintaining Health in the Nation's Elderly , Washington, D.C.:National Academy Press;2000, pp. 65-92. Page 6 treating the condition. We would also note, that the discussion of hospitalized patients is not pertinent to recommendations for outpatient care. To review the literature on nutrition serv ices for patients with cancer, we conducted a literature search using Medlin e (1996 to present) and th e keywords malnutrition and cancer, and nutrition services and cancer. Numerous citations were found; however, there were no clinical trials that directly addressed nutrition services or tested nutritional interventions in patients with cancer. A la rge proportion of article s addressed enteral and parental nutrition, which are usually covered under the hosp ital inpatient DRG system. These articles were not considered for support of new services for patients with cancer. Since there were no specific clinical trials on nutritional interventi ons in cancer patients and outcomes, review articles were also incl uded in our study. Two reviews have stated that nutrition assessments and interventions would be prudent. In 1996 Mercadante reported that nutritional evaluation, counselli ng and adequate follow- up according to the progression of the disease are necessary befo re any nutritional inte rvention is planned.\"14 In 2000, Nitenberg and Raynard reported that \"a simple nutritional assessment and early counseling by a dietitian are essential to guide nutritional supp ort and to alert the physician to the need for enteral (EN) or parental nutrition (PN).\"15 In summary, there were no clin ical trials that directly ad dressed nutrition counseling or services for patients with cancer. However, since malnutriton is common in cancer patients, early nutrition assessments a nd interventions may be prudent. B. Cardiovascular Disease The IOM Report, \"The Role of Nutrition in Maintaining Health in the Nation's Elderly\" (2000) reported that Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) was recommended as part of the standard of care for Hyperlipidemia (described as Dyslipidemia in the IOM Report), Hypertension, and Heart Failure. In this se ction, we will focus our review on these three indications within the ge neral category of Cardiovascular Disease and make recommendations regarding only these indications. The literature search for the 2000 IOM Report is also used as a baseline for the literature search for this section of the report. In addition, we conduc ted a search of PubMed for medical literature published af ter the publication of the IOM report searching for meta- analyses and randomized controlled trials for hyperlipidemia and hypertension searching under the search terms nutrition and cardiovas cular, nutrition and dyslipidemia, nutrition and lipids, nutrition and heart disease, and nutrition and hypertension. We also searched for clinical trials for the i ndication, heart failure. The re sults were limited using aged: 65+ years, human, English, and published afte r January 1, 1999. Studies evaluating the use of specific supplements and studies not re lated to evaluating the effects of nutrition 14 Mercadante, 1996. 15 Nitenberg and Raynard, 2000. Page 7 therapy on reducing the risks of heart disease or reduction in morbidity and mortality were not used. In addition, we reviewed articles supplied by the American Dietetic Association as part of their comments on this topic. In our review, we were interested in studies where nutrition provided by a nutrition professional or a multidisciplinary intervention approach (usually including exercise, etc.) reduced blood pressure, lipids, evaluate d compliance with medical instructions, or reduced mortality and morbidity due to heart disease. Hyperlipidemia The IOM report defines dyslipidem ia (hyperlipidemia) as a high total cholesterol level as well as other abnormalities in blood lipid levels . Hyperlipidemia increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Th e relationship between high lipid levels and subsequent coronary heart disease has been documented in several major observational studies (Kahn et al, 1984; Mar tin et al, 1986; MRFIT, 1996; Sh ekelle et al, 1981). It has been generally noted that risk of coronary he art disease increases with high lipid levels. The IOM report also notes ther e is also an increasing body of evidence linking lipids to the occurrence of stroke. Evidence related to the positive effects of drug therapy is stronger than the evidence showing that dietary intervention is effectiv e in affecting hyperlipidemia. However, it has been suggested that many patients coul d reduce their lipid le vels through nutrition therapy with a nutrition profe ssional to the point that they no longer require medication. The IOM report noted that the National Cholesterol Education Adult Treatment Panels suggests that it might be possible to reduce the number of patients needing drug therapy in half (Carleton et al., 1991). The report notes that there is substantial evidence from observational studies and from randomized clinical trials to support the use of nutritiona l therapy to improve lipid profiles and thereby prevent or delay cardiovascular disease in the elderly (Martin et al., 1986; Shekelle et al., 1981; Dayton et al., 1969; Downs et al., 1998; Lipid Research Clinic Program, 1984; Sacks et al., 1996; a nd Shepherd et al., 1995). The report also noted that nutrition therapy was advocated by guidelines prepared by the American Heart Association (Krauss et al., 1996); the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (LaRosa et al., 1990,1994). As noted earlier, we conducted a search of articles and studies published after the publication of the IOM report. We found one meta-analysis and seven randomized controlled trials related to hyperlipidemia that were published after the IOM report analysis was completed. In the meta-analysis (Ketola, et al., 2000), the main outcomes of interventions by nutrition professionals were reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Reductions in risk factors for cardiovascular disease were also reviewed. Ketola found that studies reported on intermediate outcome s more than on the effects on morbidity and Page 8 mortality. However, they did find that both single and multifactorial life-style interventions (diet, exercise, smoking cessati on, etc.) could reduce cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Ketola found that the quality of studies varied substantially. The number of participants varied a great deal by study. Dropouts were re ported for most studies and excluded from the analyses. Of particular interest was the reporting that high-qual ity controlled studies with long follow-up times were rare and the widely varying outcome measurements made it hard to combine results. The combination of different interventions also made it difficult to separate the effects of nutrition th erapy from other interventions. However, the MRFIT trial did reach stat istical significance in morbidity and mortality after several years of follow-up. Ketola also found that prevention programs targeted at pre-Medicare patients with undiagnosed cardiovascular diseas e had little effect on cardiova scular morbidity and none on mortality. The meta-analysis findings support use of preventive actions aimed at patients already diagnosed with coronary hear t disease or others at high risk and had a beneficial effect on overall cardiovascular mortality. None of the randomized control trials contradi cted the findings of the IOM report. Some studies found that nutrition therapy had a short-term effect for weight loss but the reduction in fat intake could also be long term. 16 Weight loss was an important intermediate outcome to determine reductions in cardiovascular risk factors for those under age 65.17 This supports the protocols provi ded to DHHS by the American Dietetic Association that recommend addi tional nutrition therapy in th e years following the initial dietary intervention. Long-term interventions were found successful in inducing weight loss and improved cardiovascular risk factors.18 Of note were two studies that showed that dietary interventions by both physicians and dietitians for the same patients were even more effective.19 20 16 Van der Veen, et al., \"Stage-matched nutrition guidance for patients at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease: a randomized inte rvention study in family practice.\" J Pract. 2002 Sep;51(9):751-8. 17 Flynn MM, et al., \"Lipoprotein response to a National Cholesterol Education Program step II diet with and without energy restriction.\" Metabolism. 1999 Jul;48(7):822-6. 18 Metz JA, et al. \"A randomized trial of improved weight loss with a prepared meal plan in overweight and obese patients:impact on cardiovascular risk reduction.\" Arch Intern Med. 2000 Jul 24;160(14):2150-8. 19 Delahanty LM, et al., \"Clinical and cost outcomes of medical nutrition therapy for hypercholesterolemia: a controlled trial.\" J Am Diet Assoc. 2001 Sep;101(9):1012-23. Hebert JR, et al., \"A dietitian-delivered group nutr ition program leads to reductions in dietary fat, serum cholesterol, and body weight: the Worcester Area Trial for Counseling in Hyperlipidemia (WATCH).\" J Am Diet Assoc. 1999 May;99(5):544-52. Page 9 Hypertension The IOM report defines hypertension as elevat ed blood pressure and notes that it is the most common and important risk factor for at herosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the general population and am ong Medicare beneficiaries.21 Approximately 50 percent of individuals age 65 or older have hyperten sion. Treatment of hypertension is very important for minority populations such as black women where ne arly 80 percent over age 60 have hypertension.22 The report also notes that the evidence that elevated blood pressure is causally related to coronary hear t disease, stroke, and kidney disease is strong and consistent.23 McMahon (1990) summarized these studies and showed the relationship between blood pre ssure, stroke, and coronary he art disease is direct and graded as blood pressure increases. The literature related to the positive effects of drug therapy is stronger than the literature showing that dietary intervention is effectiv e in treating hypertension. This is true primarily because of the difficulty in not usi ng drug therapy when it is available for such a serious condition. The normal approach to treating hypertension is to include lifestyle modifications such as changes in diet in addition to pharmaocologic approaches. Non- pharmacologic approaches such as changes in diet are used as the initial therapy for Stage 1 hypertension24 and as an adjunct to drug therapy. The report notes that there is substantial evidence from observational studies and from controlled clinical trials to support the use of nutritional therapy to lower blood pressure. The intermediate outcomes of adoption of an overall healthy diet such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Trial (DAS H) diet includes reduced salt intake, reduced alcohol intake, and increased pot assium, magnesium, and calcium intake. There is a preponderance of evidence as noted in the IOM report, that a high intake of salt adversely affects blood pressure. Three me ta-analyses are noted that support this assumption: Cutler et al., 1997; Graudal et al., 1998; and Group, 1988; a nd Khaw and Barrett-Connor, 1990 are observational studies that also support this assumption. Older indi viduals and African- Americans appear to be particularly sensitive to the effects of salt on blood pressure. The findings were shown to be applicable to th e elderly in Whelton et al., 1998. The IOM report also noted that nutrition therapy for hypertension is recommended as part of the standard of care by the Working Group Report on Hyperten sion in the Elderly (National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group, 1994).25 21Institute of Medicine, The Role of Nutrition in Maintaining Health in the Nation's Elderly , Washington, D.C.:National Academy Press;2000, p. 100. 22 Ibid. 23 Ibid, p. 101. 24 Stage 1 hypertension refers to either a sytolic blood pressure of 140 to 159 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 99 mm Hg (IOM report, p. 101). 25 Institute of Medicine, The Role of Nutrition in Maintaining Health in the Nation's Elderly , Washington, D.C.:National Academy Press;2000, p. 106. Page 10 As noted earlier, we conducted a search of articles and studies published after the publication of the IOM report. We found six randomized controlled trials related to hypertension that were published after th e IOM report analysis was completed. None of the randomized control trials contradicted the findi ngs of the IOM report. The primary outcome measured was a reduction in blood pressure. Secondary findings included reductions in risk for coronary he art disease, kidney di sease, and stroke. Mortality was not addressed in the studies. Several studies found that a comprehensive lifestyle change can substant ially lower blood pressure in patients also receiving drug therapy.26 27 While the measured effects were s hort term, other studies show that blood pressure reduction persists as long as participants adhere to therapy.28 29 Lifestyle modifications are also important in view of survey data that shows hypertension control rates of less than 27 percent nationwide.30 Weight loss/dietary modification was an important intermediate outcome to determine reductions in cardiovascular risk factors for those under age 65. 31 This supports the protocols provided to DHHS by the American Dietetic Association that recommend additional nutrition therapy in the years following the initial dietary intervention by dietary professionals. Long-term interventi ons were found successful in inducing weight loss and improved cardiovascular risk factors.32 Some of the studies did not have participan ts over the age of 65 and a small number of participants that limite d the value of the study.33 The sample sizes for the other studies ranged from 45 to 459. Some of the studies di d include individuals up to 70 years of age and are therefore considered applicable to the Medicare population. The interventions included more than nutriti onal counseling by dietary prof essionals. Therefore, the outcomes of the studies cannot be completely attributed to nutriti on therapy, especially those including prep ared meal plans.34 35 26 Miller ER, et al., \"Results of the Diet, Exerci se, and Weight Loss Intervention Trial (DEW-IT).\" Hypertension 2002;40:p.616. 27 Metz JA, et al. \"A randomized trial of improved weight loss with a prepared meal plan in overweight and obese patients:impact on cardiovascular risk reduction.\" Arch Intern Med. 2000 Jul 24;160(14):2157. 28 Whelton PK, et al., \"Sodium reduction and weight loss in the treatment of hypertnesion of older persons: a randomized controlled trial of nonpharmacological interventions in the elderly (TONE)>\" JAMA 1998;279:839-846. 29 Steven VJ, et al., \"Long-term weight loss and chan ges in blood pressure: results of the Trials of Hypertension Prevention, Phase II.\" Ann Intern Med 2000;134:1-11. 30 Burt VL, et al., \"Trends in the prevalence, awarenes s, treatment, and control of hypertension in the adult US population.\" Hypertension 1995;26;60-69. 31 Flynn MM, et al., \"Lipoprotein response to a National Cholesterol Education Program step II diet with and without energy restriction.\" Metabolism. 1999 Jul;48(7):822-6. 32 Metz JA, et al. \"A randomized trial of improved weight loss with a prepared meal plan in overweight and obese patients:impact on cardiovascular risk reduction.\" Arch Intern Med. 2000 Jul 24;160(14):2150-8. 33 Ibid. 34 Hayes RB, et al., \"Nutritionally complete prepared m eal plan to reduce cardiova scular risk factors: A randomized clinical trial.\" J of the Am Diet Assoc Sept 1999;99(9);1077. Page 11 Heart Failure The IOM report defines heart failure as a clin ical syndrome resulting from damage to the heart that results in the h eart pumping blood ineffectively. The condition is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medica re beneficiaries and is considered the most costly cardiovascular illness in the United States.36 The vast majority of heart failure patients are the elderly.37 Heart failure is typically treated with drug therapy and nonpharmacologic therapy to control symptoms, improve the quality of life, prolong survival, and prevent acute episodes requiring hospitalization. 38 The primary non-pharmacologic therapy is sodium restriction, as noted in the guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association.39 However, the IOM report notes that no trial has specifically tested the effect s of nutrition therapy alone for heart failure patients. The most common factor leading to acute episodes requiring hosp italization for urban African-Americans was nonadherence to medi cal regimen (diet and/or drugs) for 64 percent of patients admitted with heart failure.40 Therefore, if nutrition therapy could change behavior for these pati ents, it would be very valuable in reducing hospitalizations. The IOM report found that several small randomized clinical trials and a few observational studies supported the use of multidisciplinary programs (including nutrition therapy) to treat heart failure (Chapman and Torpy, 1997; Ghali et al., 1988; Rosenberg, 1971; Kortis et al., 1994; Rich et al., 1995; Stewart et al., 199 9). They also noted that nutrition therapy is recommended as part of the standard of care in guidelines prepared by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. 41 42 As noted earlier, we conducted a search of articles and studies published after the publication of the IOM report. We found one randomized controlled trial (and no clinical trials) that related directly to our questions about nutrition and heart failure. We excluded 35Metz JA, et al. \"A randomized trial of improv ed weight loss with a prepared meal plan in overweight and obese patients:impact on cardiovascular risk reduction.\" Arch Intern Med. 2000 Jul 24;160(14):2150. 36 Rich MW, Nease RF, \"Cost-effectiveness analysis in clinical practice.

The randomized controlled trial was a follo w-up to the Lyon Diet Heart Study that evaluated relationships of dietary patterns and traditional risk factors for recurrence after a first myocardial infarction. The Lyon Diet Heart Study is a randomized, single-blind secondary prevention trial to test the Mediterranean type diet. 43 The randomized controlled trial found that the protective effect of the Medi terranean dietary pattern was maintained up to four years af ter the first infarction. Howeve r, the study failed to show a reduction in myocardial infarc tions and did not prove that nutritional interventions could reduce the incidence of heart failure. C. Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is a bone disease that causes a pa tient's bones to become thin and fragile so that they can break during norma l daily activities. Osteoporosis is also characterized by the structural deterioration of bone tissue. These broken bones, also known as fractures, occur typically in the hip, spine, and wrist . Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for an estimated 44 million Americans. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to ha ve low bone mass, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis. Of the 10 million Americans estimated to have osteoporosis, eight million are women and 2 million are men. 34 million Americans, or 55% of the people 50 years of age and older, have low bone mass, which puts them at increased risk of developing osteoporosis and related fractures. 44 Among women, osteoporosis appears to have different rates of incidence in different ethnic groups. Five percent of non-Hispanic black women over age 50 are estimated to have osteoporosis; an estimat ed additional 35 percent have low bone mass that puts them at risk of developing osteoporosis. Twenty percent of non-Hispanic white and Asian women age 50 and older are estimated to have osteoporosis, and 52 percent are estimated to have low bone mass. 45 Osteoporosis generally affects fewer men than women and varies among different ethnic groups. Seven percent of non-Hispanic wh ite and Asian men age 50 and older are estimated to have osteoporosis, and 35 per cent are estimated to have low bone mass. 43 DeLorgeril M, Salen P, Martin JL, Monjaud I, Delaye J, Mamelle N, \"Mediterranean Diet, Traditional Risk Factors, and the Rate of Cardiovascular Comp lications Four percent of non-Hispanic black men age 50 and older are estimated to have osteoporosis, and 19 percent ar e estimated to have low bone mass. Three percent of Hispanic men age 50 and older are estimated to have osteoporosis, and 23 percent are estimated to have low bone mass. 46 Osteoporosis is responsible for more than 1.5 million fractures annually, including: o 300,000 hip fractures; o 700,000 vertebral fractures; o 250,000 wrist fractures; and o 300,000 fractures at other sites. Although there are no symptoms of the diseas e the National Institute s of Health (NIH) has determined that there are risk factors that the public sh ould take into consideration. Some of these risk factors include: o Personal history of fracture after age 50 o Current low bone mass o History of fracture in a 1st degree relative o Being female o Being thin and/or having a small frame o Advanced age o A family history of osteoporosis o Estrogen deficiency as a result of menopause, especially early or surgically induced The economic impact of this disease in the Un ited States is costly. The estimated national direct expenditures (hospitals and nursi ng homes) for osteoporotic and associated fractures were $17 billion in 2001 ($47 million each day) - and the cost is rising.47 Today there is no known cure for osteoporosis, therefore the osteoporo tic suffer is limited to the use of various drugs that are pres cribed, often to women, at the onset of menopause. There are medications that are also prescribed to men. Due to the lack of a cure many experts suggest that prevention, by way of nutrition, would help alleviate the high incidence of osteoporosis. Vi tamin D and calcium intake are the primary focus of the medical nutritionist s to alleviate the burde n of this disease. The area of medical nutrition therapy has incr eased the need to educate patients about what they can do to prevent the onset of the disease. The IOM Report was one of the primary articles utilized to determine the need to review osteoporosis and medical nutrition therapy for the Medicare population. This report utilized articles from 1993 through 1999. This report utilized one consensus statement from the World Health Organi zation of 1994 and the National Osteoporosis 46 Ibid 47 Ibid Page 14 Foundation (1999) both of which were strongl y supportive of incor porating nutritional interventions for osteoporosis. Of the 32 articles reviewed, 12 articles were used in the evidence summary that represented a str ong opinion to support implementation of medical nutrition for osteoporosis. The remaining sources were review articles. Klurfield (2001) evaluated the synergy between medical and nutrient therapies. He states in this review article that nutrients such as calcium, vitamin D, and others play an important role in this disease. He notes that weight management is an important factor that is often overlooked in the management of this disease. The author cautions the readers not to ignore the st rong placebo effect associat ed with many alternative nutritional therapies. The journal of Public Health Nutrition (2001) , a British journal, recommends that a safe and effective way to reduce osteoporotic fr actures is by increasing sunlight exposure 48 and providing the daily intake of 400-800 IU of vitamin D and a daily intake of 700- 800mg of calcium. These recommended daily intakes are for those elderly living in Europe. Bonjour and colleagues (2001) discuss the nece ssity of protein inta ke and bone growth. They state that there is a link to the bone ma ss in adolescence and the fracture rate in the elderly. The rate of bone growth is describe d as hereditary and ge netic, and linked to bone mass in adolescents and to osteoporotic fr acture in the elderly. They state that protein under-nutrition plays a ke y role in the rising incidenc e of hip fractures in the elderly. The importance of wei ght-bearing exercise along with increased protein intake is also stressed as an important combina tion to strengthen bones in adolescents. The articles that were review ed did not provide a clear trea tment or preventive measure. The subjects that participated in each of reviews varied in age from adolescence to the elderly. It also seems that researchers ha ve not fully agreed on what nutritional supplement, protein intake, calcium increase, or vitamin D contributes to bone creation and strengthening. Some proponents of strengthening bones state that this can only be done via weight-bearing physical exercise, which will strengthen the muscles surrounding the bone and make the bone less likely to fracture. A literature search was performed using the criteria of medical nut rition and osteoporosis, osteoporosis and nutrition. The date range was from 2000 through 2003 to utilize the most current literature. The search was isol ated to human subjects and English articles. The yield of usable articles was six articles th at were specific to the relationship between osteoporosis and nutrition. None of the articles were based on randomized clinical trials (RCTs). None of the articles were based on clin ical trials. One articl e, Blalock et al, was based on behavioral intervention and was comprised of a two by two factorial design, which insured that all levels of the interv ention occurred with all other levels. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) Report was also utilized. 48 Excessive exposure to sunlight may increase the incidence of skin cancer. Page 15 Not all proponents of medical nutrition thera py have agreed that the use of increased vitamin and mineral intake is the method by which to reduce the onset or prevalence of osteoporosis. The use of the increases in vitamin D, calcium, and protein are not universal specific amounts. In other words ther e is no agreement as to the doses to be given to alleviate the risk of this disease. In Europe as well as in America, the lack of sunlight may cause the fractures and having more time in the sun as well as having more vitamin D may decrease elderly patients' ri sk of osteoporosis. The use of calcium has long been the main focal point of regenera ting bone mass, due to the calcium found in bones; however, the dosage needed to cause th is regeneration of bone tissue is unclear. The FDA will not allow products to be labele d with the suggestion that the product will prevent osteoporosis due to its level of calcium. Based on the literature revi ewed by CMS, it is suggested that no single factor will influence the amount of osteoporo tic fractures for the elderly. Although it is important to eat a diet that contains calcium, get enough sunshine and ingest the proper amount of vitamin D, the importance of heredity, ethni city, gender, and predisposing factors during adolescence cannot be forgotten. Currently there are large campaigns in effect to broaden the public 's knowledge of the need for more calcium to strengthen thei r bones. The milk manufacturers in America sponsor many of these advertisements. Physiologically, bone development continues until the third decade of life, at which time bone fo rmation begins to dec line. In order for the literature to be sufficient to demonstrate th e efficacy of calcium in the treatment of osteoporosis, it would be necessary for the literature to show that bone formation declines may be reversed by the intake of calci um or vitamin D, or even protein. Page 16 D. End Stage Renal Disease - Dialysis The number of individuals with End Stage Re nal Disease (ESRD) continues to grow in the United States. In 1999, 424,179 people were diagnosed with renal disease that resulted from diseases such as diab etes, hypertension, and glomerulonephritis.49 The Government Accounting Office recently pr ojected that the di alysis population will continue to grow at a 7 percent annual rate. 50 Nutrition therapy has always been a part of the treatment of individuals recei ving maintenance dialysis. When BIPA provided medical nutrition therapy coverage for patients with renal disease, it excluded renal patients who were receiving dialysis for which payment is made under section 1881 of the Social Security Act.51 Congress did not cover MNT for dialysis patients because dietary servic es are already provided to dialysis patients under the minimal service requirements at 42 CFR 405.2163. This regulation requires the attending physician and a qualified dietitian52 to evaluate the nutritional n eeds of dialysis patients. The dietitians are responsible for assessing the nutritional and dietetic needs of each patient, recommending therapeutic diets, c ounseling patients and their families on prescribed diets, and monitoring adherence a nd response to diets. However, no data was available concerning the quality of MNT services provided under the dialysis benefit. Congressional staff requested th at DHHS conduct research to determine the adequacy of MNT provided as part of the renal dialysis benefit and include our findings in this report. DHHS contracted with the University Re nal Research and Education Association (URREA) at the University of Michigan to evaluate certain aspects of nutrition therapy provided to dialysis patients. While a l ong term study of outcomes associated with nutrition therapy would have been ideal, within the time available, we measured certain factors and compared them to how services are provided under the fee-for-service MNT benefit. A study called the Modification of Diet in Renal Diseas e Study (MDRD) found that the ratio of dietitians to participants and the frequency of contact had important implications for adherence to the dietary requirements which are believed to slow the progression of renal disease. 53 Therefore, we evaluated these and other factors to determine the amount of nutrition therapy provi ded (measured in time) to all dialysis patients. This amount was compared to the amount of medical nutrition therapy we currently cover for other renal patients (3 hours plus additional hours based on medical necessity). The study was not designed to compare nutrition counseling services provided to different type s of renal patients. 49 www.niddk.nih.gov/health/kidney/pubs/kustats/kustats.htm. 50 GAO-04-63, October 2003. 51Compilation of the Social Security Laws, Volume I, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington:2001, section 1861(s)(2)(V)(ii), p. 1084. 5242 CFR 405.2102 defines a dietitian for the purposes of being considered a qualified dietitian in an ESRD facility as a person who is eligible to be a register ed dietitian by the American Dieteic Association or has baccalaureate or advanced degree with major studies in food and nutrition or dietetics, and has at least 1 year of experience in clinical nutrition. 53 Ibid. Page 17 The findings from URREA's report are included below. Patient to Dietitian Ratio As noted earlier, we used the patient to di etitian ratio as one of the most important measures in determining the adequacy of nutri tion therapy in dialys is centers. Figure 1 shows the distribution of dietiti an responses regarding the pa tient-to-Registered Dietitian (RD) ratio. Almost half of the dietitians (49% ) reported ratios of 90 or more patients per RD. This included hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients combined. The mean ratio was 94 patients per RD and the median was 90, with a range of 20-280 patients per RD. However, it should be not ed that our patient to die titian ratios include part time dietitian work. In the industry, those figures are typically based on only full-time employees. Figure 1: Patient to dietitian ratio for hemo dialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients PT less 50 51-70 71-90 91-110 111-130 131-150 150 plus Patient to RD Ratio Total Dietitian Time at a Dialysis Facility When considering the appropriateness of nut rition therapy in di alysis centers, we determined that we should measure the amount of dietitian resour ces by measuring the total hours per week registered dietitians spend providing dietetic services dialysis facilities (Figure 2A). More th an half of the facilities (54%) had at least a half-time dietitian ( 20 hours per week), and 5% of the dieti tians reported spending more than 40 hours per week at a dialysis facility. The mean was 25.3 hours per week, and the median TP PT 54 University Renal Research and Education Association (URREA)CMS contract 500-00-0028, Task Order No. 0001, \"MNT Survey of Renal Dialysis Centers\", Ann Arbor, MI, March 2003, p. 6. 21 16 14 15 12 14 8 0 5 10 15 20 25 Dietitians(%) Page 18 was 24 hours. The responses ranged from 4-60 hours per week. There was a linear relationship between the patient-to-dietitian ra tio and the total hours per week a dietitian spent at a dialysis facility (Figure 2B and Ta ble 3). Dietitians in th e highest tertile (>110 patients per dietitian) spent twic e as much time, on average, at a dialysis facility than dietitians in the lowest tertile (<65 patients per dietitian).

Page 19 Face-to-Face Patient Contact Time As a quality issue, we were concerned with the amount of time that dietitians spend in face-to-face interactions with patients. Several data el ements characterizing patient interactions were measured. Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of dietitian visits per year for the average chronic in-center hemodialys is (CHD) patient and chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) patient. Approximately 68% of the dietitians reported that their CHD patients received 30 visits or less per year (i.e., 2.5 visits per month). The mean number of visits per year for CHD patients was 28 a nd the median was 24, with a large range of 4-78 visits per year. In contrast to CHD patie nts, 95% of the dietiti ans reported that their CPD patients receive 20 visits or less per ye ar. Both the mean and the median for CPD patients was 12 visits per year, with a range of 1-52.

Not surprisingly, it appears that CPD patients receive longer, but fewer, dietitian visits per year compared with CHD patients. This is not unexpected because the CPD patients who receive dialysis at home come into the fac ility less frequently than those receiving dialysis in the Center. The median face-to-face contact time was 15 minutes for CPD patients and 10 minutes for CHD patie nts per typical dietitian visit. TP PT 57 Ibid., p. 8.

The mean and median time was 15 hours per patient per y ear, with a range of 2-38 hours.

Page 21 This total dietitian time per patient per year includes face-to-face contact time, as well as other activities that indirectly relate to pa tient care. More than half of the dietitians reported that they spent 50%-55% of thei r time in face-to-fac e activities and the remainder of their time on activities such as care planning, chart documentation, CQI initiatives, meetings, and other administrative duties. Furthermore, 85% of the dietitians reported that chart documentation was done on a monthly basis for CHD patients. Perhaps of greater importance is the total face-to-f ace contact time per patient per year. In order to calculate this information, we used the number of visits per year per patient (Figure 3) and the reported face-to-face cont act time per visit (Figure 4). Figure 6 shows that the total face-to-face c ontact time per patient per year was typically less for CPD patients compared with CHD patients. The mean was 5.3 hours and the median was 4.2 hours, with a range of 0.6-24 hours per CHD patient per year. In comparison, the mean was 3.3 hours and the median was 3.0 hours, with a range of 0.25-17.5 hours per CPD patient per year.

Page 22 Comprehensive Initial Evaluations The statistics reported thus far have been fo r the typical routine follow-up visits between dietitians and dialysis patients. For the longer compre hensive assessments that are initially performed for new patients, a sepa rate series of questions was asked. The dietitians reported a mean of 45 and a median of 38 comprehensive initial assessments performed in the last year. Figure 7 shows the average time sp ent with a patient during an initial assessment. The mean number of minut es per comprehensive assessment was 51 minutes, with a median of 45 minutes and a range of 10-120 minutes.

For albumin, 70% of the dietiti ans reported that thei r facility used the Bromocresol green (BCG) test and 11% used the test.

Figure 11 shows that, in a categorical model, great er face-to-face contact time (i.e., >6 hours compared with <3 hours) is associated with fewer pa tients having a low albumin value of 3.4 g/dl ( P<0.04). 65 Ibid.

Summary Descriptive Statistics of Dietitian Survey Clearly, the size of the facility and the ratio of patients to dietitians affect many of the values reported on dietitian availability. Ta ble 3 shows the summary of the statistics previously reported by tertile of patient -to-dietitian ratio (<65, 65-110, and >110 patients). The total hours per w eek a dietitian spends at a dialysis facility providing dietitic services increases as the patient ratio increases. More importantly, the total dietitian time per patient per year and the total face-to-face contact time per patient per year does not decrease significantly as th e patient load per dietitian increases. 66 Ibid., p. 14. 6 Page 27 Table 3: Descriptive statistics of diet itian survey by tertiles of patient-to- dietitian ratio67 Tertiles of Patient:RD Variable Mean Med SD Min Max Ratio First (<65) Total hours per week providing di etetic services 15.1 15.0 7.3 4.0 40.0 spent 35.1 30.0 5.0 70.0 %Time spent on care planning (not face-to-face) 23.7 20.0 15.9 5.0 75.0 %Time spent on other activitie s (not face-to-face) 21.4 20.0 14.2 5.0 80.0 Average time (minutes) of face-to-face contact between dietitian and CHD patient per visit 12.1 10.0 6.5 0.0 30.0 # of visits the average CHD patient receives in one 27.3 24.0 16.6 4.0 75.0 year Total # of comprehensive assessments performed in past year 30.5 22.0 25.6 2.0 150.0 Avg time (min) per patient during comprehensive assessment 52.7 45.0 21.2 20.0 120.0 Hours of RD time per patient per year 17.3 15.6 7.3 4.5 37.8 Hours of RD face-to-face contact time/CHD patient/year 5.5 4.0 4.5 0.9 24.0 Hours of comprehensive evaluations per year 25.0 18.8 19.3 2.5 93.8 Second (65-110) Total hours per week providing di etetic services 26.7 25.5 10.2 8.0 45.0 %Time spent on assessments (face-to-face) 20.6 20.0 10.8 5.0 %Time spent on - face) 36.9 35.0 14.6 8.0 75.0 %Time spent on care planning (not face-to-face) 16.8 15.0 10.9 1.0 50.0 %Time spent on other activitie s (not face-to-face) 27.4 25.0 18.6 2.0 83.0 Average time (minutes) of face-to-face contact between dietitian and CHD patient per visit 11.3 10.0 4.8 2.0 25.0 # of visits the average CHD patient receives in one 30.4 24.0 16.4 12.0 78.0 year Total # of comprehensive assessments performed in past yr 41.0 30.0 30.0 2.0 150.0 Avg time (min) comprehensive assessment 52.8 60.0 23.7 10.0 120.0 Hours of RD time per patient per year 15.7 15.7 5.6 4.2 29.7 Hours of RD face-to-face contact time/CHD patient/year 5.3 4.2 3.9 1.0 20.0 Hours of comprehensive evaluations per year 37.4 25.5 32.9 0.3 162.5 67 Ibid., p. 15.

Discussion Patient-to-Dietitian Ratio and Dietitian Time The mean ratio observed in this study (94 patients per RD; range 20-280 patients) was lower than the currently recommended ratio of 100-150 patients per dietitian68 . However, 8% of the dietitians reported ratios of 150 patients or more per dietitian. Table 3 shows that as the patient-to-dietitian ratio increases , the total dietitian time per patient per year and the total face-to-face contact time per pa tient per year decreases. This may be an indicator that patients receive less interaction and individualized care in facilities that are less well staffed and where resources are more likely to be limited. That this is a potential problem is supporte d by Figure 11, which shows that greater face- to-face contact time with dietitians may be associated with better serum albumin measures. Of course, there are many non-nutri tional factors that may affect serum albumin measures, especially in the dialysis population, such as infection or inflammation, fluid overload, and an abolic or catabolic processes.69 Therefore, this relationship may not be a causal relationship. Part of the relationship may be due to more frequent monitoring of laboratory data at facilities where there is greater patient interaction with dietitians. 68 National Kidney Foundation, \"K/DOQI Clinical Pr actice Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure.\" AM J Kidney Dis, 2000;35(6) Suppl2:S9-S10, and S17-S104. 69 Pifer TB, et al., \"Mortality risk in hemodialysis patients and changes in nutritional indicators:DOPPS.\" Kidney Int, 2002;62(6):2238-2245. Page 29 The results of this survey showed a wide variation for face-to-face contact between dietitians and dialysis patients. Mean face-to-face contact time for all dialysis patients was 4.4 hours per patient per year (median of 3.2 hours). This value was less for peritoneal dialysis patients (mean=3.3; median=3.0) and higher for chronic in-center hemodialysis patients (mean=5.3 hours, medi an=4.2). The recommended amount of face- to-face contact time for patients with diabet es and chronic renal insufficiency (i.e., excluding dialysis patients) per patient per ye ar under the current MN T benefit is 3 hours (base) for the first year and 2 hours for all s ubsequent years. Additional hours are covered if deemed medically necessary by the treating physicians [4]. Given the greater severity of renal failure and complications of ESRD and dialysis, it is not surprising that the total hours of face-to-face cont act time per dialysis patient per year is higher than the currently recommended levels for MNT benefit coverage for less severe stages of renal disease. Nutrition Assessment The most commonly used nutritional indicators listed in Table 2 were the tools most readily available at dialysis facilities (body weight and laboratory measures). Furthermore, these laboratory measures may have critical implic ations for dialysis patients if not carefully monitored (e.g., phos phorus, calcium, albumin, and PTH). It is clear from Table 2 that dietitians use a num ber of different nutritional indicators for assessment rather than one single indicator. This is in line with Guidelines 1 and 2 of the NKF-K/DOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure70, which states the importance of utilizing a panel of nutritional markers to assess nutritional status. Many of the commonly used nutritional indicators have been shown to be highly predictive of ESRD patient outcomes.71 72 However, it is surp rising that only 45% of the dietitians reported using subjective global assessment (SGA) as a measure of nutritional status. SGA, an evaluation that co rrelates subjective and obj ective aspects of a patient's medical history and physical examin ation, is an inexpens ive and simple method to use and has been shown to be highly predictive of patient mortality and morbidity.73 74 70 National Kidney Foundation, \"K/DOQI Clinical Pr actice Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure.\" AM J Kidney Dis, 2000;35(6) Suppl2:S9-S10, and S17-S104. 71 Pifer TB, et al., \"Mortality risk in hemodialysis patients and changes in nutritional indicators:DOPPS.\" Kidney Int, 2002;62(6):2238-2245. 72 Leavey SF, et al., \"Simple nutritional indicators as independent predictors of mortality in hemodialysis patients.\" Am J Kidney Dis, 1998;31:997-1006. 73 Pifer TB, et al., \"Mortality risk in hemodialysis patients and changes in nutritional indicators:DOPPS.\" Kidney Int, 2002;62(6):2238-2245. 74 McCann L, \"Subjective global assessment as it pertains to the nutritional status of dialysis patients.\" Dial Transplant, 1996, 25:199-202.
