How Is Cyclosporine Used? Cyclosporine is taken daily by mouth in capsule or liquid form. The liquid form must be diluted for use, preferably mixed at room temperature with orange or apple juice. Do not mix with grapefruit juice. Cyclosporine must be taken on a consistent schedule. Cyclosporine is most often used for recalcitrant psoriasis that does not respond to other systemic treatments. Cyclosporine can provide rapid relief from symptoms. You may see some improvement in symptoms after two weeks of treatment, particularly with stronger doses. However, it may take from three to four months to reach optimal control. Extended use of cyclosporine by transplant patients is well-established. However, long-term use as a treatment for psoriasis is more limited. The FDA recommends cyclosporine not be used for longer than one year. However, there are no specific guidelines for how long you should stay off cyclosporine before resuming treatment. Some doctors may prescribe the drug for more than one year. Who Should Not Take Cyclosporine? Do not take cyclosporine if you have: - A compromised immune system; - Abnormal kidney function; - High blood pressure; - Cancer, or a history of cancer (other than basal or squamous cell skin cancers); - Severe gout. Additionally, do not take cyclosporine if you are: - Pregnant or breastfeeding - Undergoing radiation treatment What Are the Risks? Individuals previously treated with methotrexate or other immunosuppressive agents, PUVA, UVB, coal tar, or radiation therapy are at an increased risk of developing skin cancer when taking cyclosporine. Additional risks with cyclosporine include kidney damage. This increases with length of time and the amount of cyclosporine taken. Your health care provider will monitor your kidney function before and during treatment. Patients can also develop hypertension on this medication, so frequent blood pressure checks are important.
