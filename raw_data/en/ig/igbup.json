At the end of the day, the mac a nd cheese would be sold out and the greens would be thrown ou t.This demonstrates, in part, why we are having our health issues--we go for the comfort foods, what feels good in the moment, and not for what will help us in the long-term. There's ample proof that preven- tion is better and cheaper than correction. However, the down side of prevention is that when it's working, we don't see it. Our bodies are so resilient that we can fall, eat, drink, and deprive ourselves for decades before problems start to arise. However, our increasing rates of autism, diabetes, heart disease, cancers, depression and anxiety, starting earlier in life tell us that change is needed. Life expectancy is now decreasing for the first time in our modern civilization, and the cost and politics of our Health System continues to be a national problem. The USA comprises 20% of the planet's population, but consumes 80% of its pharmaceuticals and more than its share of the planet's resources. What is an Optimal Lifestyle ? The components of an optimal lifestyle are described in the center box. For most of us, some habits are close to optimal, but others need a major revision. Most scientists agree that up to 80% of modern diseases can be modified, if not outright caused by lifestyle factors. While genetics play a role, our genes watch our lifestyle, and in response turn on and off specific processes that bring us toward or away from optimal health. Change: Knowledge, Motivation, Implementation, Sustainability Most of us know what to do, but encounter obstacles that prevent us from starting, or get us off track after we have begun. So why is lifestyle change so hard? Not only don't we see any immediate results, it means letting go of some comf ortable things. It means putting significant time, money, e nergy and thought into things that initially are very uncomfo rtable. For most of us, we are willing to do that for our plane t and kids, but not for ourselves Fear can mobilize many people. A diagnosis of hear t disease, cancer, dementia or macular degeneration c an provide enough mojo to make necessary changes to sl ow down, stop or even reverse progression of disease. However, for some, fear causes paralysis or falling back to old habits and comforts. Unfounded or old beliefs and misinformation that have been absorbed from family and other authorities, commercials and the internet can be a substantial obstacle. Motivation based on fear is limited, since improvement decreases fear and motivation. Also, for some, a lack of immediate improvement, or a hidden trigger or addiction can cause the abandonment of a plan. Knowledge, inspiration and support when sufficient enable a sustainable approach. Lifestyle changes work slow and deep. They have no side effects other than their inconvenience. In reality it's just a trade-off of one inconvenience (not feeling well and taking chronic medications) for another. Health and wealth are similar in that the earlier we begin to invest, and the more consistently we do so, the easier will be our later years. We have been gifted beautiful lives; lifestyle allows us to feel and do our best. *IMPORTANT NOTES: 1.
