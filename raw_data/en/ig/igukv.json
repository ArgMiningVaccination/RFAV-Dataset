Integrative Medicine blends the best of conventional medicine with all appropriate therapeutic approaches and evidence-based global medical modalities to achieve optimal health and healing. Our motto is \"Integrating the ancient wisdom of nature with modern research of science.\" All of the therapies on this page are used in Naturopathic care but have nothing to do with being medically trained as a Naturopathic Physician. MDs/DOs can take weekend courses in these modalities, and the public can take certifications in natural and holistic therapies, but they all lack the specialty and extensive training as a Naturopathic Physician. It is the naturopathic doctor's role to remove barriers to good health by helping to create an internal and external healing environment. Integrative Medicine in Michigan is the blending of the best of conventional medicine with the use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches and evidence-based global medical modalities to achieve optimal health and healing. Our motto is \"Integrating the ancient wisdom of nature with modern research of science.\" Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) in Michigan is a collection of varied medical and health care systems, treatments, and products that are not regarded as part of conventional medicine or not integrated into the dominant health care paradigm. \"Complementary medicine\" denotes the use of complementary and alternative medicine together with conventional medicine. \"Alternative medicine\" is a method that replaces conventional treatment and therapy. \"Holistic\" medicine addresses the \"whole\" person\u2014mind, body, and spirit\u2014in the quest to achieve optimal health and wellness. According to the holistic medicine philosophy, one can achieve optimal health by gaining proper balance in life. Functional Medicine looks at the intricate functions of our organ systems and the interrelationships they have as a whole. Many chiropractors, as well as other MDs, like to call their approach Functional Medicine. It is a step in the right direction, and even though not near the scope of a Naturopathic Physician, this modality considers the 'vine'-like connectedness of interactions that occur along nutritional, digestive, detoxification, energy metabolism, hormonal, structural, and immune/inflammatory pathways. Anti-aging medicine is a clinical specialty founded on the application of advanced scientific and medical technologies for the early detection, prevention, treatment, and reversal of age-related dysfunction, disorders, and diseases. It focuses on prolonging the healthy lifespan in humans and addresses lifestyle, detoxification, diet, supplementation, and nutrition aspects of health. Holistic and Alternative Medicine are patient-centered. Not all holistic practitioners spend an hour with their patients the way a Naturopathic Doctor does. Nevertheless, they focus on the patient as a whole, including their stress level, diet, and lifestyle habits. Our first principle is to do no harm, and our objective is to find the main cause, not just treat the symptoms. We also believe in more natural and safe methods of healing, and we only use pharmaceuticals when absolutely necessary. Yes, Especially where Natural Medicine is more prevalent, most people have an MD as well as an ND. By using protocols that minimize the risk of harm, naturopathic doctors help facilitate the body's inherent ability to restore and maintain optimal health. Herbal medicine can be safely used with pharmaceuticals as long as overseen by your Naturopathic Doctor who has training in both modalities of healing. These drugs can mask symptoms, but that does not mean that they are effective as a treatment for overall health. Herbal, botanical, and natural medicine targets the root of imbalance and this can eventually lead to a decrease in symptoms permanently. Never go \"cold turkey\" with your medications, talk with your primary care physician to meet your needs and health goals. The United States government has reported 0 deaths from taking herbal and natural medicine. On the other hand, pharmaceutical drugs such as doctor prescribed medicines and over the counter drugs kill more than one million Americans every year. Besides the obvious dangers of taking prescription drugs such as overdose, allergic reactions, and interactions, pharmaceutical drugs may be harmful because they have inorganic compounds that an ordinary person cannot necessarily digest and assimilate. Pharmaceuticals can be very powerful, but on the other hand, a drug that is taken incorrectly and without precautions can have serious and even fatal consequences. Natural therapies are safe under the guidance of a properly trained Naturopathic Doctor. Holistic and Alternative Medicine are patient-centered.
