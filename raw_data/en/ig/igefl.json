A [report from Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/257307/per-capita-consumption-of-fresh-sweet-potatoes-in-the-us/) indicates that the average person in the United States ate 6.3 pounds of sweet potatoes per year in 2021, up from 4.4 pounds in 2000. Changing dietary habits, marketing hype, and people seeking healthy alternatives to traditional potatoes have all boosted sweet potatoes' popularity lately, but how much do you really know about this versatile vegetable? What Are Sweet Potatoes, and Where Do They Come From? The sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is a tuber belonging to the morning glory family of flowering plants that's native to tropical America, [according to the Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/plant/sweet-potato). It's different than a white potato, which belongs to the nightshade plant family and is more closely related to eggplants and tomatoes. Often, the flesh of the sweet potato is orange or yellow, but it can also be white, red, or purple. (Believe it or not, sweet potato leaves are also edible.) The sweet potato plant is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, and its cultivation likely dates back to prehistoric times. These days, it's grown across the globe, with China, Nigeria, and Tanzania being top producers, [reports World Atlas](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/top-sweet-potato-growing-countries.html). Within the United States, North Carolina grows the most sweet potatoes of any state, [according to 2019-2021 data](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/North_Carolina/Publications/Annual_Statistical_Bulletin/AgStat/NCAgStatBook.pdf) (PDF) from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). California and Mississippi are among other top producers in the United States. Common Questions & Answers Sweet Potatoes vs. Yams: What's the Difference? The terms \"sweet potato\" and \"yam\" are used interchangeably in America, but they are technically not the same vegetable. Most likely that can of \"candied yams\" sitting in your kitchen cabinet contains cut sweet potatoes, and the list of ingredients on the label will say so, [per USDA requirements](https://agclass.nal.usda.gov/vocabularies/nalt/concept?uri=https://lod.nal.usda.gov/nalt/33769). Whole, unpackaged yams, which are native to Africa and Asia, are starchier and drier than sweet potatoes and belong to the Dioscoreaceae family of plants. The two are so unrelated that they don't even belong to the same class of flowering plant. The sweet potato is a dicot, with two embryonic seed leaves; the yam is a monocot, with only one embryonic seed leaf, [notes the Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/everyday-mysteries/agriculture/item/what-is-the-difference-between-sweet-potatoes-and-yams/). So, why the confusion over names? Sweet potatoes come in firm and soft varieties, and producers wanted to differentiate the two, explains the Library of Congress. When soft varieties were first grown commercially in the United States, the crop workers were enslaved African people, who started calling them \"yams\" given their close resemblance to the staple African crop. The producers and shippers followed suit to distinguish soft and firm sweet potatoes commercially. But other distinguishing features of yams include dry, starchy flesh similar to white potatoes, and a dark brown, bark-like skin, [according to the North Carolina Sweet Potato Commission](https://loc.gov/everyday-mysteries/agriculture/item/what-is-the-difference-between-sweet-potatoes-and-yams/). 7 Potential Health Benefits of Sweet Potatoes Sweet Potato Nutrition Facts The [USDA lists](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/168482/nutrients) the following nutritional information for one cup of cubed sweet potato: Potential Health Benefits of Sweet Potatoes Sweet potatoes are full of vitamins and minerals that are essential to daily health, according to the UDSA's [MyPlate](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/myplate-the-ultimate-guide-to-healthy-eating/) guidelines. A sweet potato is high in beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A in the body. Eating just one of them baked in the skin will give you one and a half times your recommended daily value of the nutrient, [per the National Institutes of Health](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/) (NIH), making it one of the richest plant sources of the vitamin there is. Vitamin A is important to the health of your vision, cells, and immune system, as well as embryonic growth. Sweet potatoes are also a great source of vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that plays a key role in immune system health, connective tissue development, and wound healing, [per the NIH](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-Consumer/). Look to tubers like sweet potatoes for vitamin [B6](/diet-nutrition/benefits-of-vitamin-b6.aspx), [potassium](/pictures/foods-high-in-potassium/), and dietary fiber, [recommends the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/sweet-potatoes/). Sweet potato leaves are increasingly being recognized as a go-to source of polyphenols, micronutrients that have been studied for their antioxidant properties. A [review published in Molecules in 2021](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/7/1820/htm) suggests that eating antioxidant-rich foods like sweet potato leaves may be associated with a decreased risk of inflammation-related chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, as well as cancer. Can Sweet Potatoes Help With Weight Loss? While a sweet potato may seem like a more diet-friendly starch option than a white potato, there are many nutritional similarities and differences to consider. [According to the Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/white-potatoes-vs-sweet-potatoes-which-is-healthier/), sweet potatoes are slightly lower in carbohydrates, but they offer roughly the same amount of satiating fiber, which means you're likely to feel fuller for longer (and, in turn, potentially eat less). And while white potatoes have slightly more calories per serving, they also have more protein \u2014 another satiating nutrient. Both contain roughly the same amount of vitamin C, while sweet potatoes offer more vitamin A. White potatoes, however, contain more potassium. Any hopes that the sweet potato has weight loss-promoting properties are preliminary. A [previous study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5154978/) observed that a protein contained in the wastewater made from processing sweet potato starch inhibited weight gain in mice that were fed a high-fat diet. The mice that were fed the protein had lower body weight, liver mass, cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as higher levels of hormones that control hunger. The researchers called for human intervention studies to confirm that effect in people. Are Sweet Potatoes Okay for People With Diabetes to Eat? When eaten in moderation, sweet potatoes can make a healthy, type 2 diabetes-friendly substitute for white potatoes. That's because compared with white potatoes, sweet potatoes are lower on the glycemic index (GI), which is a scale that measures how a food containing carbohydrates raises blood glucose levels. Foods are ranked on a scale of zero to 100, with 100 being the GI of pure glucose (sugar), [explains Harvard Health Publishing](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-lowdown-on-glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load). Glycemic control is an important goal for people with diabetes, with lower GI foods generally being healthier options. A boiled sweet potato has a GI of 44, whereas a boiled white potato has a GI of 82. But another measure gives you an even better picture of which has the ability to raise your blood sugar higher: [glycemic load](/diet-nutrition/101/nutrition-basics/the-glycemic-load.aspx). [According to Oregon State University](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/food-beverages/glycemic-index-glycemic-load), that's calculated by multiplying the GI by the number of [carbohydrate](/carbohydrates/guide/) grams in a serving and then dividing that value by 100. [According to Tufts University](https://www.nutritionletter.tufts.edu/ask-experts/what-potatoes-have-the-highest-glycemic-index/), roasted and boiled potatoes have roughly the same GI load, followed by baked potatoes and then mashed varieties (which have the highest GI value). Another point to consider is the composition of the overall meal. Eating protein and healthy fats with a starch like a sweet potato may help reduce blood sugar spikes. Needless to say, adding sweeteners like honey or toppings like marshmallows will boost GI, so skip these additives and let the vegetable's natural sweetness shine through instead. If needed, sprinkle your sweet potato with a pinch of salt and pepper \u2014 or perhaps a dash of cinnamon. Even then, check with your doctor or registered dietitian to find out the portions that are right for you. How to Select and Store Sweet Potatoes Selection Select and handle sweet potatoes with care because they bruise easily \u2014 and that bruising can promote spoilage. Opt for ones that feel heavy for their size and have no bruises, soft spots, or sign of sprouting, [recommends the University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://food.unl.edu/article/healthy-bites/sweet-potato-selection-storage-and-prep-tips). Wash them and cut off any brown spots before using them. Storage Store your sweet potatoes in a cool, dry, well-ventilated place (like a basement), but not in the refrigerator, as that will result in a hard center and bad taste. Stored and handled properly, they will last up to two weeks, according to the North Carolina Sweet Potato Commission. How to Eat Sweet Potatoes Sweet potatoes are extremely versatile: You can bake or microwave them whole in their skins, or cut them into cubes before baking, steaming, or boiling. There are numerous other ways to enjoy sweet potatoes as well. Aside from baking them in their skin (with no salt or added fat), you can try sweet potatoes oven roasted with [garlic](/drugs/garlic) and olive oil, cooked on a grill while wrapped in aluminum foil, or boiled. More indulgent treats include sweet potato chips, sweet potato wedges, sweet potato pudding, and twice-baked sweet potatoes, among a multitude of other yummy preparations.

Healthy Homemade French Fries What Are Other Potential Uses of Sweet Potatoes? Some people use sweet potato slices, purees, and cooking wastewater as ingredients in DIY beauty treatments, which they apply topically in hopes that it will improve their skin. For example, leftover sweet potatoes and scraps may be incorporated into face and hair masks, toners, eye treatments, and skin scrubs. In theory, this could be effective, because sweet potatoes are high in vitamin A, the nutrient which retinoid compounds are derived from. As the [American Academy of Dermatology Association explains](https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/skin-care-secrets/anti-aging/retinoid-retinol), over-the-counter and prescription-strength retinoids have been historically used to treat acne, but they may also be used to treat [hyperpigmentation](/beauty-pictures/tricks-to-treat-hyperpigmentation.aspx) and fine lines or wrinkles. But to assume that the benefits of the vitamin A in a sweet potato could be absorbed through the skin or hair is a leap. In any case, at least you know that eating sweet potatoes as part of a balanced diet can help keep you glowing with good health! Health Risks of Sweet Potatoes People with kidney disease should limit their intake of certain nutrients, such as vitamin A and potassium \u2014 both which are abundant in sweet potatoes and white potatoes, respectively. That's because when your kidneys aren't working properly, excess nutrients can build up in your body and cause damage. [According to the National Kidney Foundation](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/vitamineral#which-vitamins-do-i-need-to-avoid-if-i-have-kidney-disease), having too much vitamin A in your body can cause dizziness, nausea, and life-threatening complications. When the level of potassium in your blood is too high, it can result in an [irregular heartbeat](/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms/ways-your-heart-can-get-out-of-rhythm/) or a heart attack. Leaching, a process that involves soaking the vegetables for at least two hours before cooking them in water \u2014 can help pull some of the potassium out of a sweet potato, [per the National Kidney Foundation](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/potassium). But anyone with compromised kidneys should consult their doctor or renal dietitian before eating sweet potatoes. Summary Sweet potatoes are a delicious and versatile whole food packed with nutrients, including vitamin A, vitamin C, and fiber. They can be a type 2 diabetes-friendly substitute for white potatoes, since they have a lower glycemic load. Baked, mashed, or grilled, this root vegetable is a colorful and healthy addition to your plate.
