It is the source of unduplicated data for the entire scope of services included in the grant or designation for the calendar year. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a col lection of information unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OMB control number for this project is 0915 -0193 and it is valid until 02/28/2023. This information collection is mandatory under the Health Center Program authorized by section 330 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act ( 42 U.S.C. 254b ). Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 238 hours per response, i ncluding the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send com ments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Reports Clearance Officer, 5600 Fishers Lane, DISCLAIMER \"This publication lists non -federal resources to provide additional information to consumers. Neither the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) nor the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has formally approved the non -federal resources in this manual. Listing these is not an endorsement by HHS or HRSA.\" Letter from the Associate Administrator Dear Health Center Program Participant: The past year was marked by events that impacted every aspect of daily life. Health centers rose to the challenges presented, rapidly adapting to ensure primary health care services continued to be delivered to the communities they serve. Health centers scaled the adoption of telehealth, provided new lines of services , including screening and testing patients for COVID-19, and continued to deliver on the Health Center Program's mission of providing high- quality care, all in the midst of a pandemic. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the American public are indebted to your hard work and perseverance. Your dedication to meeting community needs and patient care is why HRSA's Health Center Program has continued to thrive for over 50 yea rs and will carry on the legacy of the late Dr. Jack Geiger. A civil rights activist, Dr. Geiger co -founded the Community Health Center Movement, sharply focusing his work on tackling health disparities impacting underserved communities. Dr. Geiger envisioned a country where everyone has access to high -quality health care services, regardless of their ability to pay. And it's that guiding principle that remains the foundation for the Health Center Program today. In 2019, nearly 1,400 community -based and pat ient- directed health centers with more than 13,000 delivery sites delivered high -quality, affordable, and cost-effective health care to nearly 30 million people 1. Over 1,000 health centers developed the capacity to diagnose and treat individuals with COVID-192, and, through HRSA's Expanding Capacity for Coronavirus Testing award, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, and funding to support training and COVID-19-related technical assistance, health centers were able to expand their testing capacity3 and communities across the count ry gained access to the screening and testing they needed . These numbers help to tell the story of how health centers meet the medical needs of diverse communities far and wide. Data, including w hat we receive through the Uniform Data System (UDS) with technical guidance provided in this manual, are vital to further expanding health care access, assessing the quality of care provided, reducing health care costs, and addressing health disparities that adversely affect the communities health centers serve. Your contributions to ensuring UDS data is properly captured and reported in an accurate, timely, and complete fashion exemplif y what helps shape the effectiveness of data- driven decision making in the Health Center Program. I remain deeply appreciative of the leading role health centers are playing in turning the tide on COVID -19. I'm encouraging all health center staff and patients to receive their COVID-19 vaccinations. These vaccines are safe and effective in mounting protection from the novel coronavirus. I would like to extend my gratitude once again for your commitment to underserved communities and vulnerable populations across our country through the Health Center Program.

Look -alikes DO NOT receive regular federal funding under section 330 of the PHS Act (although they may receive funding during public health emergencies, such as COVID-19) , but meet the Health Center Program requirements for designation unde r the program (42 U.S.C. 1395x(aa)(4)(A)(ii) and 42 U.S.C. 1396d(l)(2)(B)(ii)). Certain health centers funded under the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) are also required to comple te the UDS . Unless otherwise noted, for the remainder of this manual the term \"health center\" will refer to all the entities listed above that are required to submit a UDS Report. ABOUT THE UDS The UDS is a standard data set that is reported annually and provides con sistent information about health centers. This core set of information encompasses patient characteristics, services provided, clinical processes and health outcomes, patients' use of services, staffing, costs, and revenues for the calendar year . It is the source of unduplicated data for the entire scope of services included in the grant or designation for the calendar year. If the health center brings services or service delivery sites into scope of project during the calendar year, data must be included f rom the period after the date of the scope change. HRSA routinely reports these data and related analyses, making them available to health centers in HRSA's Electronic Handbooks (EHB s) and to the public through HRSA's BPHC website . WHAT THIS MANUAL INCLUDES This manual includes reporting requirements and resources to assist with completion of the UDS Report and that apply to the calendar year 20 21 UDS Report due February 15, 2022 . Reporting requirements include the approved UDS changes for the calendar year. The 2021 Program Assistance Letter (PAL) 20 20-07 provides an overview of major changes. A list of personnel by service category and by job title who may be eligible to produce countable \"visits\" for the UDS is shown in Appen dix A . k Issues that affect multiple tables are addressed in Appendix B . nkSampling methods for selecting patient charts for clinical quality measure reporting are provided in Appendix C . Resources and supports to assist health centers , including links to electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs), are provided in Appendix G . A glossary of key te rms is available in Appendix H . Acronyms used throughout the UDS Manual are defined in Appendix I . UDS SUPPORT BPHCDATA .NET 12 2021 UDS MANUAL | General Instructions General Instructions WHAT TO FILE The UDS includes two parts that health centers submit through the EHB s: 1) All health centers use the Universal Report, which consists of the UDS tables, the HIT F orm, the O ther Data Elements Form, and the Workforce Form. 2) Health Center Program awardees that receive section 330 grants under multiple program funding authorities (Community Health Center [CHC] [330(e)] program, Migrant Health Center [MHC] [ 330(g) ] program, Health Care for the Homeless [HCH] [330(h) ] program, and/or Public Housing Primary Care [PHPC] [330(i) ]) also complete separate Grant Reports. o The Grant Reports provide data comparable to the Universal Report for Tables 3A, 3B, 4, 6A, and part of Table 5 . o Grant Reports are only completed for th e portion of the program that falls within the scope of a project funded under a particular funding authority. o Awardees DO NOT file a separate Grant Report for the scope of project supported under the CHC (330(e)) program. The EHBs reporting system automatically identif ies all the reports needed to meet the UDS reporting requirements. Please contact the Health Center Program Support line at 877-464 -4772 if there appear to be errors. The Universal Report is an unduplicated count of all patients served by the health center regardless of funding source; the Grant Report is a subset of patients reported on the Universal Report served under a special population funding authority. Thus, no cell in a Grant Report may have a number larger than the same cell in the Universal Report. Report all the data for any patient who receives services under sections 330(g), (h), or (i) in the proper Grant Report . Include services provided to these patients regardless of the funding source. WHAT TO SUBMIT The UDS includes 1 1 tables and 3 forms (in the appendices) that provide consistent demographic, clinical, operational, and financial data.

CALENDAR YEAR REPORTING Who Reports UDS What is Reported How t o Report When t o Report All health centers funded or designated in whole or in part before October 1, 2021 Approved in -scope activities from January 1 through December 31, 2021 Report even if no grants were drawn down for some or all programs during the calendar year. Through the Electronic Handbooks (EHBs) starting January 1, 2022 Preliminary Reporting Environment (PRE) and offline tools are available in Fall 2021 . January 1 t hrough February 15, 2022 UDS Report reviews are conducted from February 15 through March 31, 2022 . UDS SUPPORT .NET 14 2021 UDS MANUAL | General Instructions The UDS is a calendar year report. Health centers\u2014including those whose designation or funding begins, either in whole or in part, after January 1 \u2014must report in -scope activities for the entire calendar year. Similarly, health centers with a fiscal year or grant period other than January 1 to December 31 will still report on the calendar year, not on their fiscal or grant year. If one or more service delivery sites of a health center designated as a look-alike received section 330 New Access Point ( NAP ) funding before October 2021 , exclude all the data related to those funded service delivery sites from the look -alike UDS Report for 2021 and report the data related to the funded service delivery sites in the awardee UDS Report for 2021 . If the entire look -alike program became funded before October 2021, re port only an awardee UDS Report for the year. Health centers whose designation or funding end s during the year should discuss their reporting requirements with their project officer. No UDS Report is filed if the health center was funded or designated for the first time on or after October 1 of the calendar year. IN-SCOPE REPORTING All health centers must submit data that reflects activities in the HRSA health center project, as defined in approved applications and reflected in the official Notice of Award /Designation. For organizations that operate programs or service delivery sites that are out -of-scope, limit the reporting to the approved scope of project only. DUE DATES AND REVISIONS TO REPORTS The period for submission of complete and accurate UDS Reports is January 1 through February 15, 202 2, 11:59 p.m. local time . From February 15 through March 31, 202 2, a Health Center Program UDS Reviewer will review your report and , as needed, help you explain or correct the reported data. The UDS Reviewer sends communications and data change requests through EHBs via a non-HRSA.gov email address to the health center contact listed in the EHBs . Communicate directly with the assigned UDS Reviewer during this time to address questions they have raised. Final, corrected submissions are due no later than March 31 , 2022. HRSA does not accept changes after this date. HRSA may grant a reporting exemption under extraordinary circumstances , such as the physical destruction of a health center. Health centers must request such exemptions directly from the BPHC Office of Quality Improvement through Health Center Program Support . For report deadline and exemption help at any time, please contact Health Center Program Support at 877 -464- 4772 .NET 15 2021 UDS MANUAL | General Instructions HOW AND WHERE TO SUBMIT DATA Health center personnel use their username and password to log into the EH Bs to complete and submit their UDS Reports. The system supports the use of standard web browsers4 and i t provides electronic forms necessary to complete the Reports. The Preliminary Reporting Environment ( PRE) provides early access to the EHBs and is available in the fall. This allows health centers to : enter available UDS data, help identify potential data reporting errors, and provide additional preparation time to compile UDS data. To facilitate a team -based approach, there are also offline reporting templates available within the EHBs. For more information on these tools, visi t the UDS Modernization Initiative web page. Health centers are required to designate one person as the UDS contact. The UDS contact receives all communications about the UDS Report. This person may be asked to explain the data reported on the UDS tables during the review. Be sure the UDS contact information is updated in the EHBs. Health centers grant individual personnel \"view\" or \"edit\" privileges in the EHBs . These pri vileges apply to the whole report, not just specific tables. Health centers may give data entry responsibility to several people, each using separate login credentials. Health center personnel with EHBs access can work on the forms in sections, saving interim or partial versions online as they work and returning to complete them later. The EHBs saves user progress until the health center completes all tables, runs system checks on the data, and makes a formal submission. The c hief executive officer (CEO) or project director usually does this but may delegate the authority to someone else. At the time of submission, the UDS requires the submitter to acknowledge that the health center reviewed and verified the accuracy and validity of the data. Only submit completed reports into the EHBs. To ensure accuracy, the EHBs checks for potential inconsistencies or questionable data. The system provides a summary of which tables are complete, as well as a list of audit questions. Health center personnel must address each of the data audit findings, even if the audit question does not apply to their health center's unique circumstances. If personnel believe the data is correct as submitted, they should clearly explain any unique circumstances. Failure to submit a timel y, accurate, and complete UDS R eport by February 15 , 202 2, 11:59 p.m. (local time) will result in a condition being placed on your grant award . Additional restrictions, including the requirement that all drawdowns of Health Center Program grant award funds from the Payment Management System (PMS) have the prior approval of the HRSA Division of Grants Management Operations (DGMO) and/or limits on future funding (e.g., base adjustments) , may also be placed on your grant award. Note: Retain h ealth center UDS reporting backup documentation and files for a minimum of one year or through a date determined by the health center. Please refer to Appendix G: Health Center Re source s for resources that may be helpful for completing the UDS Report. 4 While most browsers should work with the EHBs, it is certified to work with Internet Explorer (IE) Version 8.0 through 11.0 o r Firefox 3.6 or higher. Health centers having a problem with other browsers should consider using IE -8, 9, 10, or 11 or Firefox 3.6 or higher for this task. More information about EHBs' recommended settings is available on the EHBs website. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 16 2021 UDS MANUAL | General Instructions FAQ S FOR THE GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 1. Do we report only the services provided to patients under HCH, MHC, or PHPC grant funds on the Grant Report? No. Include activity for all patients described in the approve d grant scope of project, regardless of the funding source. For example, if patients experiencing homelessness receive medical services in the 330(h) -supported homeless medical van, report this activity on the Homeless Grant Report tables. If patients experi encing homelessness receive dental services at the clinic, where 330(h) funds are not used, this activity would also be report ed on the Homeless Grant Report tables regardless of the dental funding source. 2. When do we complete a Universal Report and a Grant Report? In summary, health centers that receive funds under only one BPHC funding authority complete the Universal Report and no Grant Reports. Health centers funded through multiple BPHC funding authorities complete a Universal Report for the combined projects and a separate Grant Report for activity covered by their MHC, HCH, and/or PHPC program grant(s). Examples include the following: A CHC awardee that also has HCH funding completes a Universal Report for all in -scope activity and a Grant Report fo r activity under the HCH program, but it does not complete a Grant Report for the CHC funding. A CHC awardee that also has MHC and HCH funding completes a Universal Report, a Grant Report for the HCH program, and a Grant Report for the MHC program. An HCH awardee that also receives PHPC funding completes a Universal Report and two Grant Reports\u2014one for the HCH program and one for the PHPC program. An HCH awardee that receives no other Health Center Program funding will file a Universal Report and will not f ile a Grant Report. 3. We had a service delivery site that closed and is no longer in-scope. Do we report service delivery sites or services that are removed from scope of project in the UDS Report? Yes. If services or service delivery sites are removed from your scope of project , report on all activities (visits, personnel , revenue , etc.) up until the date they were removed. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 17 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Tables Instructions for Tables that Report Visits, Patients, and Providers Health centers serve many individuals in different ways. Not all individuals, encounters, and health center personnel will count in the UDS Report. The following section defines countable visits, patients, and providers for the UDS. COUNTABLE VISITS Visits determine who to count as a patient on the ZIP Code Table and Tables 3A, 3B, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, and 7. Report visits by type of provider on Table 5 and for selected diagnoses and selected services on Table 6A. Countable visits are encounters between a patient and a licensed or credentialed provider who exercises independent professional judgment in providing services that are: documented, individual,5 in-person or virtual .6 Count only visits that meet all these criteria. Services must be provided by an individual classified as a \"provider \" for purposes of providing countable visits. Not all health center personnel who interact with patients qualify as a provider . Appendix A provides a list of health center personnel and the usual status of each as a provider or non -provider for UDS reporting purposes . Visits provided by contractors and paid for by or bi lled through the health center are counted in the UDS if they meet all other criteria. These include migrant voucher visits, as well as outpatient or inpatient specialty care associated with an at-risk managed care contract. In these instances, if the visit is not documented in the patient's health record, a summary of the visit (rather than the complete record) must appear in the patient's health record, including all appropriate Current Procedural Terminology ( CPT) and International Classification of Dise ases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes. Below are definitions and criteria for reporting visits. Table 5 provides further clarifications. See Clinic Visits, Column B . Documentation Health centers must record the service and associated patient information , in print or electronic form , in a system that permits ready retrieval of current data for the patient. The patient health record does not have to be complete to meet this standard. Indepe ndent Professional J udgment Providers must be acting on their own, not assisting another provider, when serving the patient. 5 An exception is allowed for behavioral health visits, which may be conducted in a group setting. 6 Only interactive, synchronous audio and/or video telecommunication systems that permit real -time communication between a distant provider and a patient may be considered and coded as telemedicine services. The term \"telehealth\" includes telemedicine services but encompasses a broader scope of remote health care services. Telemedicine is specific to remote clinical services, whereas telehealth may include remote non -clinical services, such as provider training, administrative meetings, and continuing medical education, in addition to clinical services. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 18 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Tables Independent professional judgment is the use of the professional skills gained through formal training and experience and unique to that provider or other similarly or more intensively trained providers. Behavioral Health Group Vi sits A behavioral health provider who provides services to several patients simultaneously receives credit for a visit for each individual only if the ser vice is documented in each patient's health record. Examples of \" group visits \" include family therapy or counseling sessions, group mental health counseling, and group substance use disorder counseling where several people receive services that are documented in each patient's health record. Other considerations: The health center normally bills each patient, even if another grant or contract covers the costs. If only one patient is billed (for example, when a family member participates in a patient's counseling session), count only the billed individual as a patient and count the visit for that one patient. When a behavioral health provider conducts services via telemedicine, the provider can be credited with a visit only if the service is documented in the patient's health record. The session will normally be billed to the patient or a third party. DO NOT count group medical visits. Location of Services Provided A visit must take place in health center s' approved service delivery sites (e.g., clinics, schools, homeless shelters, as listed on Form 5B ) or in other location s that DO NOT meet HRSA's site criteria but are included in the health center's scope of project (e.g., hospitals, nursing homes, extended care facilities). In addition, virtual visits may occur from other locations. See instructions for Virtual Visits . Only count one inpatient visit per patient per day , regardless of how many clinic providers see the patient or how often they do so. Other considerations: Visits also include encounters with existing hospitalized patients, whe n health center medical personnel \"follow \" the patient during the hospital stay as the provider of record or whe n they provide consultation to the provider of record. This applies when the health center pays their medical personnel and bills the patient either for the specific servi ce or through a global fee. When a patient's first encounter is in a hospital, in respite care, or in a similar facility that is not specifically approved in Form 5B as a service delivery site under the scope of the H ealth Center Program , none of the services for that patient are counted in the UDS. Counting Multiple Visits by Category of Service Multiple visits occur when a patient has more than one visit with the health center in a day (in-person and/or virtual). Count only one visit p er patient per service category per provider per location in a single day, regardless of the types or number of services provided or where they occur, as described in the table on the following page. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 19 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Tables Other considerations: If multiple medical providers in a single category deliver multiple services to a patient on a single day , count only one visit , even if third -party payers may recognize these as separate billable services. This is typically credited to the provider performing the highest level of or m ost care, although the health center needs to make this determination for itself . Count two visits in a scenario in which services are periodically provided to a patient by two different providers of the same service category type who are located at two different service delivery sites on the same day. This permits patients who are in challenging environments (e.g., in parks or migrant camps) to receive services outside the health center from a licensed or credentialed health center provider and receive services again on the same day at the health center from a different licensed or credentialed provider. A virtual visit may count as a separate visit when a patient has another visit on the same day only if the providers are different and the assigned service delivery location of each provider is different. Maximum Number of Visits per Patient per Day at the Same Service Delivery Site # of Visits Visit Type Provider Examples 1 Medical physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, certified nurse midwife, nurse 1 Dental dentist, dental hygienist, dental therapist 1 Mental health psychiatrist, licensed clinical psychologist, licensed clinical social worker, psychiatric nurse practitioner, other licensed or unlicensed mental health providers 1 Substance use disorder alcohol and substance use disorder specialist, psychologist, social worker 1 for each provider type Other professional nutritionist, podiatrist, speech therapist , acupuncturist 1 Vision ophthalmologist, optometrist 1 for each provider type Enabling case manager, health educator PATIENT Patients are people who have at least one countable visit during the calendar year. The term \"patient\" applies to everyone who receives clinic or virtual visits, not just those who receive medical or dental services. The Universal Report includes all patients who had at least one visit during the calendar year within the scope of project supported by the health center grant or designation. Report these patients and their visits on Tables 5 and 6A for each type of service (e.g., medical, dental, enabling) received during the calendar year. On the ZIP Code Table, on Tables 3A and 3B, in each section of Tables 4 and 5, and for each service o n Table 6A, count each patient once and only once. This applies even if they received more than one service (e.g., medical, dental, enabling) or received services supported by more than one program authority ( i.e., section 330(g), section 330(h), section 330(i)). For each Grant Report , patie nts reported are those who ha d at least one countable visit during the calendar year within the scope of project activities supported by the specific section 33 0 program authority , even if the specific service is not paid for by the grant . The number of patient s reported in any cell on the Universal Report includes patients reported in the same cell in the Grant Report. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 20 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Tables Services and Individuals Not Reported on the UDS Report Some services DO NOT count as a visit for UDS reporting , even though they are critical to the overall provision of care to an individual or a community . Someone who only receives one of the services described belo w is not a patient for purposes of UDS reporting. If an individual receives additional services that require independent professional judgment from a health center provider and the services are documented, they may be considered a patient of the health center. The following situations are NOT countable visits: Health screenings or outreach Do not count screenings (e.g., COVID- 19, blood pressure, diabetes) as countable visits, including: Information sessions for prospective patients; health presentations to community groups; information presentations about available health services at the center; services conducted at health fairs or schools; immunization drives; services provided to group s, such as dental varnishes or sealants provided at schools; hypertension or diabetes testing; or similar public health efforts that frequently occur as part of community activities that involve conducting outreach or group education. Group visits Do not count visits conducted in a group setting, except for behavioral health group visits. The most common non -behavioral health group visits are patient education or health education classes (e.g., people with diabetes learning about nutrition). Tests and other ancillary services Do not count services required to perform such tests, such as drawing blood or collecting urine, and other ancillary services, including: Laboratory tests (including COVID -19, purified protein derivatives [PPDs], pregnancy, or Hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]. Measuring and imaging (including blood pressure, height, weight, sonography, radiology, mammography, retinography, or computerized axial tomography). Dispensing or administering medications Do not count dispensing medications, including dispensing from a pharmacy or administering medications (such as buprenorphine or warfarin). Do not count giving any injectio n (including for vaccines, COVID -19, allergy shots, or family planning), regardless of education provided at the same time. Do not count providing narcotic agonists or antagonists or mixes of these, regardless of whether the patient is assessed at the time of the dispensing and regardless of whether these medications are dispensed regularly. Health status checks Do not count follow -up tests or checks (such as patients returning for HbA1c tests or blood pressure checks). Do not count wound care (which is follow -up to the original primary care visit) . Do not count taking health histories. Do not count making referrals for or following up on external referrals. Services under the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program Do not count a person whose only contact with a health center is to receive services (including nutrition) under a WIC program. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 21 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Tables PROVIDER A provider exercises independent professional judgment in the provision of services rendered to the patient, assumes primary responsibility for assessing the patient, and document s services in the patient's health record. Only one provider receives credit for a visit, even when two or more providers are present and participate. If two or more providers of the same type share the services for a patient , only one provider receives credit for a visit (see Counting Mul tiple Visit s by Category of Service ). In cases where a preceptor (or attending physician) is following and supervising a licensed resident, the resident receives credit. (S ee Appendix B for further instruction on counting interns and residents .) When health center personnel are following a patient in the hospital, the primary health center personnel in attendance during the visit is the provider who receives credit for the visit, even if other personnel are present. Except for physicians and dentists , allocate personnel time by function among the major service categories based on time dedicated to other positions . Report physicians according to the specialty in which they are board certified. If a physician has multiple board certifications, report them according to the specialty in which they are functioning. FTE and visits for physicians with multiple board certifications should be allocated according to the specialty they are practicing. Appendix A provides a listing of personnel. Only personnel designated as a \"provider\" can generate visits for purposes of UDS reporting. Table 5 provides further clarifications to these defin itions. See Instructions for Table 5: Staffing and Utilization . Providers may be personnel of the health center, contracted personnel , or volunteers. Contracted providers who are paid by the health center with gr ant funds or program income and who are part of the scope of project , serve center patients, and document their services in the health center's records count as providers. Contracted providers who are paid for specific visits or services with grant funds or program income and report patient visits to the direct recipient of a BPHC or BHW grant or designation (e.g., under a migrant voucher program or of HCH awardees with sub -awardees) are providers . The direct recipient of the BPHC or BHW grant or designati on reports these providers' activities. Since such providers often have no time basis in their report, no FTE would be reported for them if time data were not collected. Count providers who volunteer to serve patients at the health center's service delivery sites under the supervision of the health center's personnel and document their services and time in the center's records. Individuals or groups who provide services under formal agreement or contract when the health center does not pay for the visit are not credited as providing a health center visit, unless they are working at an approved service delivery site under the supervision of the appropriate health center personnel and are credentialed by the health center. These providers are generally providing services noted in Column III of the grant scope of project application Form 5A . UDS SUPPORT .NET 22 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Tables FAQ S FOR THE INSTR UCTIONS FOR TABLES 1. What level of documentation is required for emergency, hospital, or respite services? Can we count the visit if the record is incomplete? A patient receiving documented emergency services counts even if some portions of the patient healt h record are incomplete. Providers who see their established patients at a hospital or respite care facility and make a note in the institutional file can satisfy this criterion by including a summary discharge note showing activities for each of the visit dates. 2. Do we credit the visit to the nurse assisting a physician? No. A nurse assisting a physician during a physical examination by taking vital signs, recording a history , or drawing a blood sample does not receive credit as a separate visit. Eligible medical visits usually involve one of the \"Evaluation and Management\" billing codes (99202- 99205 or 99211- 99215) the health maintenance codes (99381 -99387, 99391- 99397). 3. Two different physicians treated the patient at the health center on the same day. Can we count both? No. Only count one visit per service category when care is provided at the same location. For example, only count one medical visit if a n obstetrici an/gynecologist (OB/GYN) provides prenatal care to a patient at the health center and an i nternist treats that same patient's hypertension at the same location on the same day. Other examples may include: a family physician and a pediatrician who both see a child or a dental hygienist and a dentist who both see a patient on the same day. 4. How should we count our nurse who splits their 40 hours between medical care and patient education? The nurse who dedicates 20 hours to medical care and 20 hours to providing health education each week would split their 1.0 FTE between medical nurse and health educator. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 23 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for ZIP Codes Instructions for ZIP Code Data The ZIP Code T able collects data on patients' geographic origin by primary medical insurance. There are no major changes to this table. PATIENTS BY ZIP CODE All health centers must report the number of patients served by ZIP code and medical insurance. This information enables BPHC to better identify areas served by health centers, potential service area overlap s, and possible areas of unmet need . Patients may be mobile during the calendar year ; health centers report patients' most recent ZIP code on file. This information is to be updated each calendar year. ZIP Code of Specific Groups For health centers serving patients without residence information , such as individuals from transient groups , follow the instructions below : Patients experiencing homelessness Report the service location ZIP code as a proxy when a ZIP code location is unavailable or the location offered is questionable. If the patient receives services in a mobile health center van and has no other ZIP code, report the ZIP code of the van's location that day . Although it is appropriate from a clinical and service delivery perspective to collect the address of a contact person to facilitate communication with the patient; DO NOT use the contact person's address as the patient's address. Patients who are migratory agricultural workers Report the ZIP code of where the patient lived when they received care from the health center. Migratory agricultural workers (as opposed to seasonal workers) may have both a temporary address, where they live when working, as well as a permanent or \"downs tream\" address. Report the ZIP code for the location (fixed service delivery site or mobile camp outreach) where patients received services for those whose precise ZIP code is unavailable (e.g., living in cars or on the land). Patients who are foreign n ationals Report the current ZIP codes for people from other countries who reside in the United States either permanently or temporarily. Report \"Other ZIP Code \" in cases where p atients have a permanent residence outside the country. Unknown ZIP Code Report residence in the Unknown category f or patients whose residence is not known or for whom a proxy ZIP code is not available. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 24 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for ZIP Codes Ten or Fewer Patients in ZIP Code To ease the burden of reporting, combine and report patients from ZIP codes with 10 or fewer patients in the Other category . INSTRUCTIONS FOR TYPE OF INSURANCE Report primary medical insurance for all patients, regardless of the services they receive. This even applies to patients who did not receive medical care. Report on patients' origin by their primary medical insurance. Report c hildren served in school -based health center settings only if they have complete clinic intake forms that show insurance status and family income. DO NOT report children as uninsured unless they are receiving minor consent services o r their family is uninsured. DO NOT report patients as uninsured simply because they are receiving a service that is not covered by health insurance. Insurance Categories Report the patient's primary medical insurance covering medical care, if any, as of the last visit during the calendar year. Primary medical insurance is the insurance plan that the health center would typically bill first for medical services. The categories for this table are slightly dif ferent from those on Table 4; they combin e Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP), and Other Public into one category. Specific rules guide reporting: Report patients who have both Medicare and Medicaid (dually eligible) as Medicare patients, because Medicare is billed before Medicaid. The exception to the Medicare-first rule is the Medicare- enrolled patient who is still working and insured by both an employer -based plan and Medicare. In this case, the principal health insurance is the employer-based plan, which is billed first. Report Medicaid and CHIP patients enrolled in a managed car e program administered by a private insurance company as Medicaid/CHIP/Other Public. Report Medicare administered by a private insurance company as Medicare. Report the patient by their medical insurance, even if the health center does not bill to the spe cified insurance. Report any third -party insurance that patients carry. Section 330 grant awards used to serve special populations ( e.g., MHC , HCH, PHPC) are not a form of medical insurance. Report patients who are incarcerated as uninsured (whether they were seen in the correctional facility or at the health center), unless Medicaid or other insurance covers them, and at the ZIP code of the jail or prison. In instances where patients are in residential drug programs, college dorms, military barracks, etc., report the patient as living at the ZIP code of the residential program, dorm, or barrack and by their primary medical insurance, not as uninsured . Report patients whose care is subsidized by state or local government indigent care programs as uninsured. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 25 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for ZIP Codes Report patients who received insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace as Private. Affordable Care Act subsidies (i.e., cost-sharing premium reductions and premium tax credits) DO NOT affect insurance categories. Classify patients by their third -party insurer. FAQ S FOR PATIENTS BY ZIP CODE TABLE 1. Do we need to collect information and report on the ZIP code of all our patients? Yes. Although health centers report residence by ZIP code f or all patients, some centers may draw patients from many ZIP codes outside of their normal service area. To ease the burden of reporting, consolidate ZIP codes with 10 or fewer patients in the \"Other\" category. 2. Do we need to collect information and report on the primary medical insurance of all our patients? Yes. Although the ZIP code of a patient may be \"unknown,\" medical insurance information must be obtained for every individual counted as a patient. 3. If a patient did not receive medical care, do we stil l need their medical insurance information? What about dental patients? Yes. This information is about patients' primary medical insurance resources, not billing. Obtain medical insurance information for all patients, even dental -only patients. For example , if a p atient only receive d case management services, determine if they have primary medical insurance. 4. How do we report patients by insurance when we DO NOT bill that form of insurance? Report the patient by their primary medical insurance, even in those instances that the health center does not or cannot bill to that insurance. Include, for example, patients enrolled in managed care Medicaid but assigned to another primary care provider, or patients with private insurance for which the health center's pr oviders have not been credentialed. 5. How do we report patients by insurance who have their care subsidized by an indigent care program? Report patients as uninsured when their care is subsidized by a state or local government indigent care program. Example s include New Jersey's Uncompensated Care Program, New York's Public Goods Pool Funding, and Colorado's Indigent Care Program. 6. Does the number of patients reported by ZIP code need to equal the total number of unduplicated patients reported on Tables 3A, 3 B, and 4? Yes.

PATIENTS BEST SERVED IN A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH (LINE 12) This section of Table 3B identifies the patients who have linguistic barriers to care. Report on Line 12 the number of patients who are best ser ved in a language other than English, including those who are best served in sign language. Include those patients who were served in a second language by a bilingual provider and those who may have brought their own interpreter. Include patients residing in areas where a language other than English is the dominant language, such as Puerto Rico or the Pacific Islands. Not e: Data reported on Line 12, Patients Best Served in a Language Other than English, may be estimated if the health center does not maintain actual data in its HIT. If an estimate is required, the estimate should be based on a sample where possible; indicate this on the Table 3B, Table Comments . This is the only place on the UDS where an estimate is accepted. PATIENTS BY SEXUAL ORIENTATION (LINES 13-19) Sexual orientation is how an individual describes their emotional and sexual attraction to others. Health centers are encourage d to establish routine data collection systems to support patient -centered, high- quality care for patients of all sexual orientations . As with all demographic data, this information is self -reported by patients (or by their caregivers if the patient cannot answer the questions themselves). Collection of sexual orientation data from patients younger than 18 years of age is not mandated , but the opportunity to report this information must be provided to all patients regardless of age. Furthermore, patients have the choice not to disclose their sexual orientation . When sexual orientation information is not collected or this section of the registration form is left blank, report the patient on Table 3B as \"Unknown\" on L ine 1 8a.

The UDS classifications are consistent with those used by the Census Bureau and HHS as per the October 2011 guidance titled \" U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Implementation Guidance on Data Collection Standards for Race, Ethnicity, Sex, Primary Language, and Disability Status \" issued by OMB . These standards govern the categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. OMB requires a minimum of five categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) for race. In addition to the five race groups, OMB states that respondents should be offered the option of selecti ng more than one race. Line 6 permits reporting of those people who have chosen to report two or more races. 2. Do we have to report the race and Hispanic or Latino/a ethnicity of all our patients? Yes. The UDS requires the classification of race and Hispanic or Latino/a ethnicity information to assess health disparities across sub -populations. Health centers whose data systems DO NOT support such reporting must enhance their systems to permit the required level of reporting, rather than using the \"unreported/refused to report\" categories. 3. How are patients of Hispanic or Latino /a ethnicity reported? Race and ethnicity data appear in a matrix on Table 3B . Patients who in other systems might be reported as Hispanic or Latino /a independent of race are reported in Column A of Table 3B of the UDS as Hispanic or Latino /a and report ed on Lines 1- 7 based on their race. If Hispanic or Latino/a is the only identification recorded in the center's patient files, report these patients in Column A on Line 7 as having an \"unr eported\" racial identification , and update your data system to permit the collection of both race and ethnicity . 4. Can we have a choice on our registration form of \"more than one race\"? No. To count patient s as being of \"more than one race ,\" they must have t he option of checking two or more boxes under race and must have indeed checked more than one. 5. How are patients who receive different types of services or use more than one of our health center's service delivery sites reported ? For example, how do we rep ort a patient who receives both medical and dental services or a patient who receives primary care from one service delivery site but gets prenatal care at another? The ZIP Code Table and Tables 3A, 3B, and 4 each provide an unduplicated patient count. Count each individual who has at least one visit reported on Table 5 only once on the ZIP Code Table and , Table s 3A, 3B, and 4, regardless of the type or number of services they receive or where they receive them. We define visits in detail in the Instructions for Tables that Report Visits, Patients, and Providers section. Note the following: DO NOT count individuals who receive WIC services and no other services at the health center as patients on Table 3A or 3B (or anywhere i n the UDS). UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 32 | Instructions for Tables 3A and 3B DO NOT count individuals who only receive imaging or lab services or whose only service was an immunization or screening test as patients on Table 3A or 3B (or anywhere i n the UDS). DO NOT count individuals who only receive health status checks and health screenings as patients on Table 3A or 3B (or anywhere in the UDS). 6. Should the numbers on Tables 3A and 3B tie to UDS data reported on other tables? Yes. The sum of Table 3A, Line 39, Columns A and B (total patients by age and by sex assigned at birth) must equal: Total Patients by ZIP Code; Table 3B, Line 8, Column D (total patients by Hispanic or Latino/a ethnicity and race); Table 3B, Line 19 (total patients by sexual orientation); Table 3B, Line 26 (total patients by gender identity); Table 4, Line 6 (total patients by income); and Table 4, Line 12, Columns A and B (total patients by insurance status). The sum of Table 3A, Lines 1 -18, Columns A and B (total patients age 0 -17 years) must equal: Table 4, Line 12, Column A (total patients age 0 -17 years). The sum of Table 3A, Lines 19 -38, Columns A and B (total patients age 18 and older) must equal: Table 4, Line 12, Column B (total patients age 18 and older). 7. I have multiple, separate data systems. How do I include their data on these tables? It is the health center's responsibility to ensure there is no duplication of data. Count patients only once, regardless of the number of different types of services they receive. This may require the downloading and merging of data from each system to eliminate duplicates or checking them manually. This can be a time- consuming and potentially expensive process and should start as soon as the year ends to ensure sufficient time for completion prior to the submission due date. 8. What do we do if we did not collect sexual orientation and/or gender identity elements? All health centers are required to include these data elements in the registration or intake forms or du ring the visit. If you did not implement the gathering of sexual orientation and/or gender identity data, report patients on Table 3B as \"Unknown\" on Line 18a, sexual orientation, and Line 25a, gender identity. DO NOT use sex at birth reported on Table 3A to complete gender identity on Table 3B. UDS SUPPORT , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA 33 | Instructions for Tables 3A and 3B 9. Does the UDS require health care providers to ask minors for sexual orientation and gender identity data? The collection of sexual orientation and gender identity data is not required for minors. The information should be included in the system and in the corresponding lines if a patient chooses to self-report their sexual orientation and gender identity. If this information is unavailable for minors, report the patient on the Unknown lines (18a and 25a). 10. Will pare nts be able to access their child's response to a UDS sexual orientation and gender identity inquiry ? There are specific provisions about protecting confidentiality of minors for patient visits related to sexual health. Generally, there are \"minor consent\" laws that permit treatment to be provided to and data collected from minors without their parent's knowledge or approval. Contact your state Primary Care Association for state-specific rules and regulations. 11. How are the categories for sexual orientation a nd gender identity defined? The UDS classifications are based on the guidance provided in the 2015 Edition Health Information Technology (H ealth IT) Certification Criteria, 2015 Edition Base Electronic Health Record (EHR) Definition , and ONC Health IT Certification Program Modifications 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA 34 Instructions for Tables 3A and 3B TABLE 3A: PATIENTS BY AGE AND BY SEX ASSIGNED AT BIRTH Calendar Year: January 1, 2021 , through December 31, 2021 Line Age Groups Male Patients (a) Female Patients (b) 1 Under age 1 <blank for demonstration> <blank for demonstration> 2 Age 1 Age 2 Age 3 Age 4 Age 5 Age 6 Age 7 Age 8 Age 9 Age 10 Age 11 Age 12 Age 13 Age 14 Age 15 Age 16 Age 17 Age 18 Age 19 Age 20 Age 21 Age 22 Age 23 Age 24 for <blank for 38 over <blank for demonstration> <blank for demonstration> 39 Total Patients (Sum Line 39 = Table 3B, Line 8 Column D = Table 3B, Lines 19 and 26 = Total Patients by Z IP Code = Table 4, Lines 6 and 12.

INCOME AS A PERCENT OF POVERTY GUIDELINE , LINES 1-6 The report should include the most current income data for all patients (not only from patients applying for a sliding fee discount), which must have been collected at or within 12 months prior to the most recent calendar year visit . Determin e a patient's income relative to the 2021 federal poverty guidelines (FPG) . Report patients by income , as defined by the health center's board policy consistent with the Health Center Program Compliance Manual . Children , with the exception of emancipated minors or those presenting for minor consent services, should be classified under their parents ' income. Report patients whose information was not collected within one year of their last visit in the calendar year on Line 5 as \"Unknown.\" Self-declaration of income from patients may be acceptable if it is consistent with the health center's b oard- approved policies and procedures. This is particularly important for those patients whose wages are paid in cash and who have no other means of pr oving their income. If income information consistent with the health center's b oard policy is lacking, report the patient as having \"U nknown\" income. DO NOT allocate patients with \"U nknown\" income to income groups . DO NOT classify a patient who is experiencing homelessness, is a migratory agricultural worker, or is on Medicaid as having income below the FPG based on these factors alone. PRINCIPAL THIRD-PARTY MEDICAL INSURANCE , LINES 7-12 This portion of the table provides data on patients classified by their age and primary source of insurance for medical care. DO NOT report other forms of insurance , such as dental , mental health, or vision coverage . Note that there is no \"unknown\" insurance classification on this table, and that states often rename federal insurance programs , such as CHIP and Medicaid . HRSA requires that health centers collect medical insurance information each calendar year from all patients to maximize third-party payments . Patient p rimary medical insurance is classified into seven types , as shown on the following pages . In rare instances, a patient may have insurance that the health center cannot or does not bill. Even i n these instances, report the patient as being insured and report the type of insurance. Report the primary med ical insurance patients had at the time of their last visit regardless of whether that insurance was billed or paid for any or all of the visit services. Patients are divided into two age groups: 0- 17 (Column A) and 18 and older (Column B) based on their age on June 30, 2021 (consistent with ages reported on Table 3A) .

Report a minor receiving services with parental consent under the family's insurance. Report c hildren seen in a school -based program under their parent's health insurance. This information must be obtain ed if they are to be included in the UDS Report. Report emancipated minors or patients seeking minor -consent services permitted in the state, such as family planning or mental health services, as Uninsured if they DO NOT have access to the parent's informati on. Presume a patient with Medicaid, Private, or Other Public dental insurance to have the same kind of medical insurance. If a patient does not have dental insurance, you may not assume that they are uninsured for medical care. Instead, obtain this inform ation from the patient. Patients served in correctional facilities may be classified as U ninsured. If patients in correctional facilities have documentation of insurance , such as Medicaid or Medicare, then report them on that insurance line . Obtain the cov erage information of patients in facilities (other than correctional), such as residential drug programs, college dorms, and military barracks. DO NOT assume them to be uninsured. DO NOT report patients as U ninsured if they have medical insurance that did not pay for their visit. Medicaid (Line 8a) Report patients covered by state-run program s operating under the guidelines of Titles XIX and XXI (as appropriate) of the Social Security Act. Include Medicaid programs known by state-specific names (e.g., California's \"Medi -Cal\" program) . Include patients covered by \"state-only\" programs covering individuals who are ineligible for federal matching funds (e.g., undocumented children, pregnant patients ) and paid through Medicaid. Report patients enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare on Lines 9 (Medicare) and 9a (Dually Eligible) , but not on Line 8a. Report patients who are enrolled in Medicaid but receive services through a private managed care plan that contracts with the state M edicaid agency on Line 8a , not as privately insured (Line 11) . This also applies in states that have a Medicaid waiver permitting Medicaid funds to be used to purchase private insurance for services. CHIP -Medicaid (Line 8b) Report patients covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act and provided through the state's Medicaid program. In states that use Medicaid to handle the CHIP program , it is sometimes difficult or impossible to distinguish between \"Medicaid\" and \"CHIP -Medicaid.\" In other states, the distinction is readily apparent (e.g., they have different cards). Even where it is not obvious, CHIP patients may still be identifiable from a \"plan\" code or some other embedded code in the membership number. This may also vary from county to county within a state. Obtain information on coding practice from the state and/or county. If there is no way to distinguish between Medicaid and CHIP administered through Medicaid, classify all covered patients as Medicaid (Line 8a).

DO NOT include managed care enrollees whose capitation or enrollment is limited to behavioral health or dental services only . (However , an enrollee who has medical and dental is counted ). Member Mont hs A member month is defined as one individual enrolled in a managed care plan for one month. For example, a n individual who is a member of a plan for a full year generates 12 member months; a family of five enrolled for six months generates 30 member months (5 individuals \u00d7 6 months = 30 member months ). Member month information is most often obtained from monthly enrollment lists generally supplied by managed care companies to their providers. Health centers should always save these documents. In the event they have not been saved, health centers should request duplicates early to permit timely filing of the UDS Report. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 40 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 4 Note: It is possible for an individual to be enrolled in a managed care plan, assigned to a health center, and yet not be seen during the calendar year. The member months for such individuals are still to be reported in this section. This is the only place on the UDS tables where an individual may be reported who is not being counted as a patient. Capitated Member Months (Line 13a) Report the total capitated member months by source of payment. This is derived by adding the total enrollment reported from each capitated plan for each month. A patient is in a capitated plan if the contract between the health center and the HMO, a ccountable care organization (ACO), or other similar plan stipulates that , for a flat payment per month, the health center will provide the patient all the services on a negotiated list. (Oregon programs should include enrollees in CCOs on this line) . This usually includes, at a minimum, all medical office visits. Payments are received (and reported on Table 9D) regardless of whether any service is rendered to the patient in that month. The capitated member months reported on Line 13a relate to the net ca pitated revenue reported on (Line 13b) Report the total fee-for-service member months by source of payment. A fee-for-service member month is defined as one patient being assigned to a health center or health center service delivery provider for one month, during which time the patient may receive contractually defined basic primary care services only from the health center but for whom the services are paid on a fee-for-service basis. There is a relationship between the fee- for-service member months reported on Line 13b and the revenue reported on Table 9D on L ines 2b, 5b, 8b, and/or 11b. It is common for patients to have their primary care covered by capitation but other services (e. g., behavioral health or pharmacy ) paid separately on a fee-for-service basis as a \" carve-out \" in addition to the capitation. DO NOT include member months for individuals who receive \"carved-out\" services under a fee-for-service arrangement on Line 13b if those individuals have already been counted for the same month as a capitated member on L ine 13a. SPECIAL POPULATIONS , LINES 14-26 This section asks for a count of patients from special populations, including migratory and seasonal agricultural workers and their family members, patients who are experiencing homelessness, patients who are served by school -based health centers, patients who are veterans, and patients served at a health center located in or immediately accessible to a public housing site. Awardees who receive funding fr om section 330(g) (MHC ) and section 330(h) (HCH) must provide additional information on their agricultur al employment and/or housing characteristics. All health centers report these populations, regardless of whether they directly receive special population funding. Migratory or seasonal agricultural workers' status must be verified at least every 2 years b y MHC awardees .NET 41 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 4 Housing status must be collected by HCH awardees at the first visit of the year when the patient was identified to be experiencing homelessness. The special populations detailed below are not mutually exclusive. Patients can be reported in more than one category, as appropriate (e.g., a patient can be reported as both a veteran and experiencing homelessness). Total Migratory and Seasonal Agricultural Workers and Their Family Members, Lines 14 -16 Total Agricultural Workers or Dependents, Line 16: Report the number of patients seen during the calendar year who were either migratory or seasonal agricultural workers, dependent family members of migratory or seasonal agricultural workers, or aged or disabled former migratory agricultural workers (as described in the statute section 330(g)(1)(B)). All health centers must report on this line. Only health centers that receive section 330(g) (MHC) funding provide separate totals for migratory and seasonal agricultural workers on Lines 14 and 15. For section 330(g) awardees, the sum of Lines 14 + 15 = Line 16. For either migratory or seasonal agricultural workers, report patients who meet the definitio n of agriculture as farming in all its branches, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)-developed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and include seasonal workers included in codes 111 and 112 and all sub -codes therein, including sub-codes 1151 and 1152. Instructions for reporting migratory and s easonal a gricultural w orkers: Migratory Agricultural Workers, Line 14: Report pati ents whose principal employment is in agriculture and who establish a temporary home for the purposes of such employment as a migratory agricultural worker, as defined by section 330(g) of the PHS Act. Migratory agricultural workers are usually hired laborers who are paid piecework, hourly, or daily wages. Include patients who had such work as their principal employment within 24 months of their last visit, as well as their dependent family members who have also used the center. The family members may or may not move with the worker or establish a temporary home. No te: Agricultural workers who leave a community to work elsewhere are classified as migratory workers when served in their home community, as are those who migrate to a community to work there. o Include aged and disabled former m igratory agricultural w orkers, as defined in section 330(g)(1)(B) , and their family members . Aged and disabled former agricultural workers include those who were previously migratory agricultural workers but who no longer work in agriculture because of age or disability. Seasonal Agricultural Workers, Line 15: Report patients whose principal employment is in agriculture on a seasonal basis (e.g., picking fruit during the limited months of a picking season) , but who DO NOT establish a temporary home for purposes of such employment. Seasonal agricultural workers are usually hired laborers who are paid piecework, hourly, or daily wages. Include patients who have been so employed within 24 months of their last visit, as well as their dependent family members who are patients of the health center. No te: Seasonal agricultural workers may be employed throughout the year for multiple crop season s and as a result might work full -time. Total Homeless Patients, Lines 17 -23 Total Homeless, Line 23 : Report the total number of patients known to have experienc ed homelessness at the time of any service provided during the calendar year , even if their housing situation changes during the year . All health centers must report on this line . Only health centers receiving section 330(h) (HCH) funding provide separate totals for patients by housing location on Lines 17- 22. For section 330(h) awardees, the sum of Lines 17 through 22 = Line 23.

Include patients who reside in transitional housing or per manent supportive housing. Children and youth at risk of homelessness, homeless veterans, and veterans at risk of homelessness may be included.7 HCH awardees will provide detail on patients experiencing homelessness by the type of shelter arrangement the patient s had when they were first encountered for a visit during the calendar year while experiencing homelessness. The following applies when categorizing patients for Lines 17 through 22: Report the patient's shelter arrangement as of the first visit during the calendar year when the patient was experiencing homelessness . The shelter arrangement is reported as where the patient was housed the prior night. Report patients who spent the prior night incarcerated, in an institutional treatment program (e.g., mental health, substance use disorder), or in a hospital based on where they intend to spend the night after their visit/release. If they DO NOT know, report their shelter arrangement as Street, on Line 20. Shelter, Line 17 : Report patients who are living in an organized shelter for individuals experiencing homelessness . Shelters that generally provide meals and a place to sleep are regarded as temporary and often limit the number of days or the hours of the day that a resident may stay at the shelter. Transitional Housing , Line 18 : Transitional housing units are generally small units (six people is common) where people transition from a shelter and are provided extended, but temporary, housing stays (generally between 6 months and 2 years) in a service-rich environment. Transitional housing provides a greater level of independence than traditional shelters and may require the resident to pay some or all of the rent, participate in the maintenance of the facility , and/or cook their own meals. Count only those patients who are transitioning from a homeless environment. DO NOT include those who are transitioning from jail or those residing in or transitioning from an institutional treatment program, the military, schools, or other institutions. Doubled Up, Line 19 : Report patients who are living with others . The arrangement is considered to be temporary and unstable, though a patient may live in a succession of such arrangements over a protracted period. D O NOT count the individual who invites a patient experiencing homelessness to stay in their home for the night. Street, Line 20 : Report in this category patients who are living outdoors, in a vehicle, in an encampment, in makeshift housing/shelter, or in other places generally not deemed safe or fit for human occupancy. Permanent Supportive Housing , 8 Line 21a : Report patients who are in permanent supportive housing in this category . Permanent supportive housing usually is in service-rich environments , does not have time limits, and may be restricted to people with some type of disabling condition. Other , Line 21 : Report patients who were housed when first seen during the year but who were still eligible for the program because they experienced homelessness during the previous 12 months . HCH -funded programs may continue to serve patients who no longer experience homelessness due to becoming residents of permanent housing for 12 months after their last visit as homeless. Include them in this category. Also include patients who reside in single-room -occupancy (SRO) hotels or motels and patients who reside in other day-to-day paid housing or other housing programs that are targeted to homeless populations. 7 Health centers may use criteria as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to assist in defining \"chil dren and youth at risk of homelessness, homeless veterans, and veterans at risk of homelessness.\" 8 Health centers may use criteria as defined by HUD to assist in defining permanent supportive housing .

DO NOT report patients currently residing in a jail or an institutional treatment program as homeless until they are released to the street with no housing arrangement. DO NOT report patients who ar e part of the foster system program and are placed with a family, group home, or in some other arrangem ent as homeless. Total School-Based Health Center Patients, Line 24 All health centers that identified a school -based health center as a service delivery site in their scope of project (as documented on Form 5B ) are to report the total number of patients who received primary health care services at the approved school service delivery site(s). Report patients served at in -scope school -based health centers located on or near school grounds, limited to preschool, kindergarten, and primary through secondary schools, that provide on-site comprehensive preventive and primary health services. Services are targeted to the students at the school but may also be provided to siblings or parents and may occasion ally include p atients residing in the immediate vicinity of the school. DO NOT include as patients students who only receive screening services or mass treatment, such as vaccinations or fluoride treatments, at a school. Total Veterans, Line 25 All health centers are to report the total number of patients who served in the active military , naval, or air service, which includ es full -time service in the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marines, Navy, Space Force, or as a commissioned officer of the Public Health Service or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . In addition, include patients who served in the National Guard or Reserves on active duty status . Include this information in the patient information/intake form at each center. Report only those who were discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable. Report only those who affirmatively indicate they previously served in these branches of the military or armed forces. DO NOT report patients who do not respond, regardless of other indicators. DO NOT report veterans of other nations' militar ies, even if they served in wars in which the United States was also involved. Total Patients Served at a Health Center Service Delivery Site Located in or Immediately Accessible to a Public Housing Site, Line 26 All health centers are to report all patients seen at a service delivery site located in or immediately accessible to public housing , regardless of whether the patients are residents of public housing or the health center receives funding under section 330(i) PHPC. Report p atients on this line if they are served at health center service delivery sites that meet the statutory definition for the PHPC program (located in or immediately accessible to public housing).

Not e: Not all patients served at service delivery sites located in or immediately accessible to public housing are themselves residents of public housing, but they are to be include d in the count. FAQ S FOR TABLE 4 1. Do we determine a patient's income relative to the FPG based on the location of the health center or based on the residence of the patient? Use the FPG based on the location of the health center. All states (except Alaska and Hawaii) and the U.S. territ ories use the standard poverty guidelines. For patients being served in Alaska or Hawaii, use the FPG established for those locations. 2. Patients who are experiencing h omelessness or who are agricultural workers generally DO NOT have income verification. Can we report them as having income at 100 percent and below poverty? No. You can report them as having unknown income, but not as having income below poverty unless you verify this at least annually. However, subject to your health center's financial policies and procedures, you may document their income in your system based on their verbal attestation of their income. 3. If a patient is seen only for dental care, do we report the patient's dental insurance on Lines 7 -12? No. Table 4 reports only patients' med ical coverage. All health centers must collect medical coverage information from all patients , even if the y have not been provided medical services. Note: If a patient has Medicaid, Private, or Other Public dental insurance, you may assume they have the same kind of medical insurance. If they DO NOT have dental insurance, you may not assume they are uninsured for medical care. 4. Our state is using Medicaid e xpansion provisions to assist patients with buying private insurance. Should we count them as Medicaid or Private? If patients are Medicaid expansion patients, report them as Medicaid, Line 8a (t his may require looking for specific plan numbers or other identifying characteristics in patients' insurance enrollment) . If you are unable to identify Medicaid e xpansion patients, report them as Private, Line 11. 5. We serve students at a school -based health center. They often DO NOT know what insurance they have, if any, and they have no information on their family's income. Can we report them as having income at 100 percent and below poverty and uninsured? No. You may not report them as having income below poverty and uninsured. Obtain insurance information from the parents of students served at school -based health centers, unless they are exclusively receiving min or consent services. Minor consent services are defined by state law and are generally limited to a very specific range of services, such as those related to contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, and mental health. N ot all states provide for them. For all other services, children will require parental consent, and the consent form should include income and insurance information. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 45 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 4 Note: Subject to the health center's policies and procedures, it is acceptable to ask for this information and to assure parents that you will not bill the insurance without their knowledge. If you DO NOT obtain parental consent, report the child as having unknown income. The patient's health insurance is required, even if it is not billed. 6. Do we classify patients in the insurance section as uninsured if their medical insurance did not pay for the visit? No. Always report patients based on their primary medical care insurance, even if the insurance did not pay for the service. Some examples follow: Report a patient with Me dicare who was seen for a dental visit that was not paid for by Medicare as having Medicare for this table. Report a patient with p rivate insurance who had not reached their deductible as a p rivate insurance patient. 7. Should the number of patients by income and insurance source equal the total number of unduplicated patients reported on Tables 3A and 3B and the ZIP Code Table? Yes. 8. Is it possible to have more members in one month (average) than total patients in an insurance category ? It is possible, although it would be unusual, for the number of member months for any one payer (e.g., Medicaid) to exceed 12 times the number of patients reported on the corresponding insurance line. As a rule, there is a relationship between the member m onths reported on Lines 13a and 13b and the insured patients reported on Lines 7 through 11. 9. If we do not receive direct funding under the H CH, MHC , or P HPC programs, do we need to report the total number of special population patients served? Yes. Even health centers that DO NOT receive grant funding for special populations are required to complete the following: Line 16 (the total number of patients seen during the calendar year who were agricultural workers or their family members) Line 23 (total numbe r of patients known to have experienced homelessness at the time of any service during the calendar year) Line 24 (patients of a school -based health center) Line 25 (veterans) Line 26 (total number of patients served at a health center located in or imme diately accessible to a public housing site) DO NOT complete the details on Lines 17 -22 if you did not receive HCH funding\u2014only enter the total on Line 23 . DO NOT complete the details on Lines 14 and 15 if you did not receive MHC funding\u2014only enter the total on Line 16. UDS SUPPORT , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 46 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 4 10. What timing determines a patient's homeless status and shelter arrangement? For all health centers (regardless of HCH funding status), include the total number of patients who experienced homelessness at any point of service during the ye ar on Line 23 . For awardees that receive HCH funding, continue to count patients seen who are no longer experiencing homelessness due to becoming residents of permanent housing for 12 months after their last visit as homeless. For awardees that receive HCH funding, report all patients reported on Line 23 by their shelter arrangement on Lines 17 -22. Asking health centers to report patients experiencing homelessness by their sheltering arrangements as of their first visit during the calendar year is intended to help health centers determine to which shelter arrangement they should report a patient if shelter status changes during the year. 11. Who do we report as Patients Served at a Health Center Located in or Immediately Accessible to a Public Housing Site on Line 26? Report th e total number of patients who we re served at any health center service delivery site that you consider (based on your definitions) to be located in or immediately accessible to public hous ing, regardless of whether or not the health center receives funding under section 330(i), PHPC . This is a site -based count, and the patient's address or residence in public housing is not to be considered. 12. Do the totals need to equal other sections or tables? The following totals must be equal a cross tables and sections: ZIP Code Table, Column B must equal Table 4, Line 7, Column s A and B. ZIP Code Table, Column C must equal Table 4, Line s 8 and 10, Columns A and B. ZIP Code Table, Column D must equal Table 4, Line 9, Column s A and B. ZIP Code T able, Column E must equal Table 4, Line 11, Columns A and B. The sum of Table 3A, Line 39, Columns A and B (total patients by age and gender) must equal Table 3B, Line 8, Column D (total patients by race and Hispanic or Latino/a ethnicity); Table 3B, Line 19 (total patients by sexual orientation); Table 3B, Line 26 (total patients by gender identity); Table 4, Line 6 (total patients by income); and Table 4, Line 12, Column s A and B (total patients by medical insurance status). The sum of Table 3A, Lines 1 -18, Column s A and B (total patients age 0 -17 years) must equal Table 4, Line 12, Column A (total patients age 0 -17 years). The sum of Table 3A, Lines 19 -38, Columns A and B (total patients age 18 and older) must equal Table 4, Line 12, Column B (total patients age 18 and older). The sum of Table 3A, Line 39, Columns A and B (total patients by age and gender) must equal Table 4, Line 12 , Column s A and B (total patients by insurance status).

For example, total Medicare patients on Table 4 (Line 9) must match the total of the Medicare Column D on the Zip Code Table. Charges and collections by payer on Table 9D relates to insurance enrollment on Table 4. For example, dividing Medicaid revenue on Table 9D, Line 3, Column B by Total Medicaid Patients on Table 4 , Line 8 equals the average collection per Medicaid p atient. Reporting of managed care revenue on Table 9D relates to member months on Table 4. Dividing managed care capitation revenue by member months equals average capitation per member per month (PMPM). For example, dividing Medicaid capitated revenue (Table 9D, Line 2a, Column B) by Table 4, Line 13a, Column A equals Medicaid PMPM.

There are no major changes to this table. TABLE 5: STAFFING AND UTILIZATION This table provides a profile of health center personnel (Column A), the number of face-to-face clinic visits they render (Column B), the number of virtual visits they render (Column B2), and the number of unduplicated patients served in each service category (Column C). Service categories include: Medical Dental Mental health Substance use disorder Vision Other professional Enabling The p atient count will often involve duplication across service categories (e.g., a patient may be reported in both medical and dental patient counts) , though it is always unduplicated within service categories (e.g., regardless of number of medical visits or medical providers seen, the patient is only counted once as a medical patient) . This is unlike Tables 3A, 3B, and 4, where an unduplicated count of patients across all service categories is reported. The staffing service categories o n Table 5 are consi stent with cost categories used for financial reporting and provide adequate detail on personnel categories for program planning and evaluation purposes. Staffing information is reported only on the Universal Report table, not the Grant Report tables. Grant Reports provide data on patients served in whole or in part with section 330(h) (HCH), section 330(g) (MHC), and/or section 330(i) (PHPC) funding and the visits they had during the year. This includes all visits supported with either grant or non-grant funds. PERSONNEL FULL-TIME EQUIVALENTS (FTE S), COLUMN A Table 5 includes personnel FTE for all individuals who work in programs and activities that are within Form 5B of the health center's scope of project for all service delivery sites included in the UDS. Report all personnel in terms of annualized FTEs. Report FTEs of all personnel supporting health center operations defined by the scope of project in Column A. Personnel may provide services on behalf of the health center under many different ar rangements, including but not limited to salaried full-time, salaried part -time, hourly wages, National Health Service Corps (NHSC) assignment, under contract (paid based on hours worked or FTE), interns, resident s, preceptors, or donated time. UDS SUPPORT , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 50 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 5 DO NOT report FTEs for individuals who are paid by the health center on a fee -for-service basis in the FTE column, as there is no basis for determining their hours. V isits with providers paid through this arra ngement are still reported in Column B or B2 and the patients who received those services are reported in Column C. Identifying Employment Type and Calculating FTEs The following describe s the basis for determining someone's employment type for purposes of reporting on FTEs: One full -time equivalent (FTE = 1.0 0) describes personnel who worked the equivalent of full -time for one full year. Each health center defines the number of hours for \"full-time\" work and may define it differently for different positions. The FTE is based on employment contracts for providers and other personnel . In some health centers, different positions have different definitions of full time. Positions with different time expectations should be calculated on whatever they have as a base for that position. Some positions , per employment contracts, consider work ing 36 hours per week full time and would be considered 1.00 FTE. In this case, an 18-hour -per-week personnel would be considered 0.5 0 FTE regardless of whether other personnel in other positions work 40-hour weeks. The FTE of personnel receiv ing full-time benefits for the full year would be considered full -time = 1.0 0 FTE. Hourly personnel with no or reduced benefits who work more than full -time (i.e., overtime) will have an FTE greater than 1.0 0. For personnel who are not paid for full leave (i.e., vacation, holidays, and sick benefits), the effective FTE is calculated by dividing worked hours by adjusted full -time hours (full -time hours minus paid time off hours that full-time personnel receive). Reporting FTEs in the Appropriate Line on Table 5 Allocate all personnel time by function among the major service categories listed. DO NOT parse out the components of an encounter . The nurse who handles a referral after a visit as a part of that visit would not be allocated out of nursing. The nurse who collects vitals on a patient, who is then placed in the exam room, and later provides instructions on wound care, for example, would not have a portion of the time counted as health education \u2014it is all a part of nursing. Report an individual who is employed as a full -time provider for a full year as 1.0 0 FTE regardless of the number of direct patient care hours they provide. Providers who have released time to compensate for on -call hours , have weekly administrative sessions when they DO NOT see patients, or who receive paid leave for continuing education or other reasons are still considered full -time per their employment contract. Similarly, DO NOT count providers who are routinely required to work more than 40 hours per week as more than 1. 00 FTE. The time spent by providers performing tasks in what could be considered non-direct -service clinical activities, such as charting, reviewing labs, filling or renewing prescriptions, returning phone calls, arranging for referrals, participating in quality improvement (QI) activities, supervising, etc., is all considered part of their overall medical care services time and should not be separately reported in a non-clinical support category. The one exception to this rule is when a chief m edical officer/m edical d irector is engaged in non-clinical activities at the corporate level (e.g., attending board of d irectors or senior management meetings, advocating for the health center before the city council or Congress, writing grant applications, participating in labor negotiations, negotiating fees with insurance companies), in which case time can be allocated t o the non-clinical support services category. This does not, however, include non -clinical activities in the medical area, such as supervising the clinical personnel , chairing or attending clinical meetings, or writing clinical protocols.

The following summarizes the personnel categories; a more detailed, though not exhaustive, list appears in Appendix A . Medical Care Services (Lines 1 -15) Physicians (Lines 1 -7) o Report physicians on Lines 1 -7 consistent with their board ing. Physicians with dual boarding may be allocated into two lines, such as internal medicine and pediatrician, based on time spent or patients seen, but both provider FTE and visits must be allocated . o Report l icensed interns and residents on the line designated for the specialty designation they are working toward and credit them with their own visits. (Thus, count a family practice intern as a family physician on Line 1) . o DO NOT report psychiatrists, ophthalmologists, pathologists, or radiologists here.

Report Clinic Visits (Column B) and Virtual Visits (Column B2) . These are mutually exclusive and t otal visits are calculated by adding Columns B and B2. Clinic Visits, Column B Report any documented in-pe rson encounter between a patient and a licensed or credentialed provider who exercises their independent professional judgment in the provision of services to the patient at that time as a visit in Column B . Report all such visits that occurred during the calendar year rendered by salaried, contracted, or volunteer providers . Report visits on the same line as the provider who conducted the visit. Most visits reported in Column B will be provided by personnel identified in Column A . Visits purchased from contracted providers on a fee -for-service basis should also be reported. Not e: DO NOT report encounter s that are screenings, tests, or vaccines (such as for COVID-19) as visits . Only report encounters that meet the full definition as a visit. Virtual Visits, Column B 2 Report any documented virtual (telemedicine) encounter between a patient and a licensed or credentialed provider who exercises their independent professional judgment in the provision of services to the patient at that time as a visit in Colum n B2 . Report all such visits that occurred during the calendar year rendered by salaried, contracted, or volunteer personnel . Report visits on the same line as the provider who conducted the visit. Most visits reported in Column B2 will be provided by personnel identified in Column A . Virtual v isits purchased from contracted providers on a fee -for-service basis should also be reported. Not e: Telemedicine is a growing model of care delivery . It is important to remember that payer, state, and federal telehealth definitions , regulations , and billing requirements regarding the acceptable modes of care delivery, types of providers, informed consent , and location of the patient and/or provider are not applicable in determining virtual patient visits fo r UDS reporting. Virtual Visit Considerations Virtual visit reporting should be consistent with the health center's scope of project. Virtual visits must meet the countable visit definitions . All reporting requirements regarding multiple visits in the same service category in the same day apply , except that two different providers based out of two different in-scope service delivery sites may be repor ted as two visits. Report virtual visits where: o The health center provider provided care to a patient who was elsewhere ( i.e., not physically at the health center). o The health center patient received services through telemedicine by a non-health -center provider paid for by the health center or by a volunteer provider who was at the health center. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 58 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 5 o The provider w as not physically present at the health center when providing care to the patient , who was in a separate location . The provider must have remote access to the patient's health record to review it and record their activities . o Interactive, synchronous audio or audio -video telecommunication systems that permit real -time communication between the provider and the patient were used . o Services are coded and charged as telehealth services, even if a third -party payer does not recognize or pay for such services. Generally, these charges would be similar to a comparable clinic visit charge. Not e: Use codes that will result in accurate identification of virtual visits. These include telehealth -specific codes with the CPT or Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code s such as G0071, G0406-G0408, G0425-G0427, G2025, modifier \".95,\" or Place of Service code \"02\" to identify virtual visits. DO NOT report: o as a virtual visit situations in which the health center does not pay for virtual services provided by a non - health -center provider ( referral). o other modes of telemedicine services (e.g., store and forward, remote patient monitoring, mobile health) or provider -to-provider consultations. o a separate clinic visit at the originating clinic. Visits Purchased from Non- Personnel Providers on a Fee-For-S ervice Basis Report these visits in Column B (clinic ) or B2 (virtual) even though no corresponding FTEs are included in Column A. To count, the v isit must meet the following criteria: the service was provided to a patient of the health center by a provider who is not part of the health center's personnel (neither salaried , volunteer, nor contracted on the basis of time worked ) although they meet the center's credentialing policies, the service was paid for in full by the health center, and the service otherwise met the definition of a visit. DO NOT include unpaid referrals , referrals where a third party (e.g., the patient's insurance company) will make the payment directly to the provider , or referrals where only nominal amounts , including facility fees, are paid although the negotiated payment may be less than the provider's \"usual, customary, and reasonable\" (UCR) rates. Visit Considerations by Personnel Line Nurse s, Line 11 Services may be provided under standing orders of a medical provider , under specific instructions from a previous visit , or under the general supervision of a physician, NP, PA, or CNM who has no direct encounter with the patient during the visit. These services must meet the requirement of exercising independent professional judgment. Report nurse visits that meet all visit criteria. See Instructions for Visits . Most patient services provided by a nurse DO NOT meet the full visit criteria. Report triage services provided by nurses and visiting nurse services when a nurse sees patients independently in the patients' homes to evaluate their condition(s). Report visits charged and coded as CPT 99211 only when all components of visit requirements were met . UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 59 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 5 DO NOT report a service if it is a follow up or completion of services from another visit (e.g., nurse calls to check up on how a patient is doing after a visit, nurse checks wound or removes sutures, nurse provides vaccines), even if it occurs at a later date. DO NOT report encounters with a nurse where the primary purpose is to conduct a lab test, give an injection, or dispense or administer a drug, regardless of the level of observation nee ded, as a visit . Most states prohibit a licensed vocational nurse or licensed practical nurse from exercising independent professional judgment; DO NOT count visits for them. Dentist s, dental hygienist s, and dental therapists, Lines 16, 17, and 17a Report only one visit per patient per day, regardless of the number of dental providers who provide services (e.g., dentist and dental hygienist both see the patient) or the volume of service (i.e., number of procedures) provided. DO NOT report the application o f dental varnishes, fluoride treatments, or dental screenings, absent other comprehensive dental services, as a visit. DO NOT report as a dental visit medical providers who examine a patient's dentition or provide fluoride treatments. DO NOT report as a dental visit a phone call between the patient and provider for a check up on a completed procedure or service. DO NOT credit services of dental students or anyone other than a licensed dental provider with dental visits, even if these individuals are working under the supervision of a licensed dental provider. Exception: Report the visits of a supervising dentist's student (i.e., one who is overseeing dental students enrolled in a graduate education program leading to a license as a dentist) as long as the supervising dentist: o has no other responsibilities , including the supervision of other personnel at the time services are furnished by the students , o has primary responsibility for the pati ents, o reviews the care furnished by the students during or imm ediately after each visit, and o documents the extent of their participation in the re view and direction of the services furnished to each patient . Other mental health, Line 20c Report visits with unlicensed mental health personnel regardless of any billing practices at the center. DO NOT report their visits elsewhere. Substance use disorder, Line 21 In programs that include the regular use of narcotic agonists or antagonists or other medications on a regular basis (daily, every three days, weekly, et c.), report only the individualized or group counseling services as visits. DO NOT report the counseling by medical or psychiatric providers of patients to determine or diagnose their medical needs, including medication assistance and substance use disorder visits .

DO NOT report retinography (imaging of the reti na), whether performed by a licensed vision services provider or anyone else, as a visit unless accompanied by a comprehensive vision exam. DO NOT report fitting glasses as a visit , regardless of who performs the fitting. Pharmacy , Line 23 Pharmacy personnel are not considered providers on the UDS (see Appendix A ), and therefore visits are not reported. Some states license clinical pharmacists whose scope of practice may include ordering labs and reviewing and altering medications or dosages. Despite this expanded scope of practice, DO NOT report clinical pharmacist encounter s with patients as visits. Case managers, Line 24 Case management visits must be documented in the patient's health record. When a case manager serves an entire family (e.g., helping with housing or Medicaid eligibility) , report only one visit, generally for an adult member of the family, regardless of documentation in other charts. Case management is rarely the only type of service provided to a patient during the year . Case managers often contact third parties in the provision of their services. DO NOT count these encounters . Patient and community education, Line 25 Report only services provided one -on-one with the patient.

Integrated behavioral health reported in the addendum includes: mental health services provided by medical providers during medical visits, substance use disorder services provided by medical providers during medical visits, and substance use disorder services provided by mental health providers during mental health visits . The addendum is reported on the Universal Report only. The information reported in the Selected Service Detail Addendum only reflects providers and their mental health or substance use disorder treatment services not already reported in the mental health and substance use disorder sections on the main part of Table 5 . The sum of mental health and substance use disorder services visits reported in the main part of Table 5 and the addendum to Table 5 provide a combined count of mental health and substance use disorder services provided. The Selected Service Detail Addendum is divided into two service categories: mental health and substance use disorders. The Mental Health Services Detail (by type of medical provider ), Lines 20a01- 20a04, is a subset of medical visits and patients reported on Lines 1 -10 in the main section of Table 5 . The Substance Use Disorder Detail (by type of medical provider ), Lines 21a -21d, is a subset of med ical visits and patients reported on Lines 1 -10 in the main section of Table 5 . The Substance Use Disorder Detail (by type of mental health provider ), Lines 21e -21h, is a subset of mental health visits and patients report ed on Lines 20a- 20b in the main section of Table 5. To identify visits where a mental health or substance use disorder treatment service may have been rendered, include at minimum all visits in which the report ed providers coded ICD-10 codes specified on Table 6A, Lines 18 through 19a for substance use disorder treatment and Lines 20a through 20d for mental health treatment . All visits reported in the addendum will also be included in the main part of Table 5 as either medical or mental health visits. Some visits provided by medical providers may include both mental health and substance use disorder treatment and will be counted in each section of the addendum, in addition to being counted as a medical visit in the main part of Tab le 5. Providers, Column A 1 Report the number of individual providers (not FTE) by type who provided mental health and/or substance use disorder services. Medical provider s can be counted once in each section if they provide both mental health and substance use disorder services. If the provider is a contract provider paid by visit or service, DO NOT count an FTE on the main part of Table 5, but count the provider in the addendum. Clinic Visits, Column B Report the number of clinic ( in-person ) visits, by provider type, where the service in whole or in part included treatment for mental health (on L ines 20a01 through 20a04) or substance use dis order services (on Lines 21a through 21h). UDS SUPPORT BPHCDATA .NET 63 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 5 Virtual Visits, Column B2 Report the number of virtual visi ts, by provider type, where the service in whole or in part included treatment for mental health (on Lines 20a01 through 20a04) or substance use disor der services (on Lines 21a through 21h). Patients, Column C Report the number of patients seen for a clinic or virtual mental health or substance use disorder service by provider(s) in the given line . Report patients (and their visits) for each type of provider listed who were seen during the year for these services. This may result in the same patient appearing on more than one line in the addendum. FAQ S FOR TABLE 5 AND SELECTED SERVICE DETAIL ADDENDUM 1. How do we determine FTE ? Use employment contracts to determine FTE . For example, a physician hired as a full -time personnel who, per their employment contract, is only required to work four 9-hour sessions (3 6 hours) per week , is considered full-time. 2. Our physicians work 35 -hour weeks. Do we report as 0.875 (35 divided by 40) FTE? No. Count them as 1.00 FTE. BPHC does not require 40-hour workweeks. Use whatever workweek time is considered full -time. 3. Do we calculate FTE for personnel with no or reduced benefits the same way we do for personnel receiving full benefits ? No. If personnel receive no or reduced benefits, calculate FTE based on paid hours. For example, in a health center that has a 40 -hour workweek (2,080 hours/year), a n individual who works 20 hours per week (i.e., 50 percent time) is reported as 0.5 0 FTE; a n individual who works full -time for 4 months out of the year is reported as 0.33 FTE (4 months \u00f7 12 months). If an individual with no benefits works 2,200 hours out of 2,080 full -time hours, report as 1.06 FTE. 4. How do I report the FTEs for a provider who regularly sees patients 75 percent of the time and covers after-hours call for the remaining 25 percent of their salary? Report personnel who are hired as full -time providers as 1.0 0 FTE regardless of the number of direct patient care hours they provide. Count as 1.00 FTE providers hired as full -time who have released time to compensate for on -call hours, who have released time to compensate for hours spent on clinical committees, or who receive leave for continuing education or other activities. DO NOT adjust for the ti me spent by a physician (for example) while not in contact with the patient, such as charting, reviewing labs, filling prescriptions, returning phone calls, or arranging for referrals . These tasks are considered part of their time as a physician. The excep tion to this rule is when a m edical d irector or chief medical o fficer is engaged in non-clinical activities at the corporate level, in which case time is allocated to the non-clinical category. This does not, however, include non-clinical activities in the medical area, such as chairing or attending meetings, supervising personnel , writing clinical protocols, designing formularies, setting hours, or approving specialty referrals. Note: Count loan-repayment recipients as full-time. Note that the FQHC Medicare intermediary has different definitions for full-time providers; these are not to be used for UDS reporting. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 64 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 5 5. Our nurses perform services that cross service categories. Do we allocate the FTE and visit activity accordingly ? That depends on if their time i s distinctly allocated by function among the major service categories. If , for example, a full -time nurse provides direct medical services and provides some patient education while seeing the patient for medical care, they would be counted as 1.0 FTE on Line 11 (Nurses). If that nurse provided case management services during 10 dedicated hours per week and provided medical care services for the other 30 hours per week, the time would be allocated as 0.25 FTE case manager (Line 24) and 0.75 FTE nurse (Line 1 1). 6. If I report costs for case management services on Table 8A, do I have to report case managers on Table 5? If a health center reports costs for case management services, one would expect to see case managers reported on Table 5, unless the service was contracted with no personnel time specifically identified. Similarly, if there are personnel on Table 5, one would expect costs on Table 8A unless personnel are volunteers. Some services DO NOT involve personnel . Spending funds on bus tokens, for example, would involve transportation costs on Table 8A, but no per sonnel on Table 5. 7. How are contracted personnel and their activities reported on Table 5? If the contracted personnel is paid based on time worked (for example, one day per week), report the FTE on Table 5, Column A, and report the visits and patients receiving services from this provider. (See Appendix B for a more complete discussion of calculating the FTE of these providers.) If the contracted personnel is paid on a fee-for-service basis, DO NOT report FTE on Table 5, Column A, but report the visits and patients. This may require additional explanation in your UDS Report, but it is not an error. 8. How are behavioral health functions reported on Table 5 ? In some systems, behavioral health is another name for mental health, and the personnel and visits are reported on Lines 20a through 20c. However, some health centers have merged the positions of mental health provider and substance use disorder provider into a single position , which they call a behavioral health provider. In this instance, the health center has two choices. The first is to assert that substance use disorder problems are mental health problems and classify its behavioral health personnel as mental health personnel on Lines 20a, 20a1, 20a2, 20b, or 20c. Another method is to carefully record the time and activities of these dual function providers. In this case, identify each visit as either a mental health visit or a substance use disorder visit so the patients and visits can be correctly classified. In addition, keep track of providers' time so that FTEs on Table 5 (and associated costs on Table 8A) can be accurately allocated and recorded to the appropriate line. 9. If a psychiatric NP provides mental health and substance use disorder services to the same patient during a visit, how should we count this? Because substance use disorder is also seen as a mental health diagnosis, count the visit under mental health for the main part of Table 5. DO NOT count the visits as one of each type. In the addendum, separately report the substance use disorder service provided by the personnel during the visits. Classify the provider and costs (on Table 8A) as ment al health. 10. Do I count the time of volunteer providers, interns, or residents? Yes. Volunteers, interns, and residents are licensed practitioners and their time is counted like that of any other practitioner. Note, however, that some may work shorter days because they are in educational sessions, may have more vacation time or other time off than other practitioners, or, in the case of volunteers, DO NOT have vacations or holidays. This would make them less than full -time. See the more complete discussion of counting volunteers, interns, and residents in Appendix B . UDS SUPPORT BPHCDATA .NET 65 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 5 11. We contract with many licensed physicians to read our test results: an ophthalmolo gist reads the retinal photos that our medical assistant takes, a radiologist over -reads the X-rays that our X-ray tech takes, the outside laboratory's pathologist provides the test results from their machines, and a consulting cardiologist confirms findings of our electrocardiograms (EKGs). Should we report them as personnel, and do we report what they do as visits? Report the costs for tests on Table 8A . DO NOT report these activities, which are important to the provision of comprehensive care to patients , separately. Tests are not counted as visits anywhere in the UDS. DO NOT report the time (FTE) of any individual who is working on a contract basis when the payment is not for their time worked but, rather, for the activity that they perform. Under some circumstances, the EHBs may identify a system edit (costs with no personnel ) that you will need to explain. 12. Where do we report community health workers that we employ? Report personnel with responsibility as community health workers on Line 27c. If, however, you are using this term to describe someone who is performing the tasks normally associated with a medical assistant, an outreach worker, or another job title, count them in the corresponding category. 13. Where do we report medical providers whose only activity at a visit is providing MAT? Report this activity o n the line of the credential ed personnel providing this treatment (i.e., physicians are counted in medical [Lines 1 -8], even if they only provide substance use disorder services at the visi t). Additionally, report the activity in the substance use disorder section of the addendum (i.e., physicians are counted on Line 21a of the addendum). DO NOT count them on the substance use disorder line of the main part of Table 5. 14. How do I count participants in a group session? Only group treatment sessions for substance use disorders , mental health, or behavioral health may be counted. The visit must be r ecorded in each participant's chart. Each patient charted in a group session must be billed and the service must be paid consistent with health center policy by either the patient, insurance, or another contract maintained by the health center. If some patients or visits are billed and others are not, count only those that are billed. DO NOT count a group encounter with a patient that is not recorded in a patient health record . DO NOT report group medical visits or group health education visits. Although in some instances they may be billable, the UDS specifically does not count these as visits. 15. Are virtual/telemedicine visits only permitted after a clinic visit at the health center? No, although virtual visits may occur from a referral from a clinic visit. If the first or only visit is a countable virtual visit, the health center must regist er the patient and collect and report all relevant demographic, service, clinical, and financial data on the UDS tables. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 66 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 5 16. Should the total number of patients reported on Table 3A be equal to the sum of the several types of service patients on the main part of Table 5? Not unless the only services you provide are medical services. On Table 5, report patients for each type of service received. For example, count a patient who receives both medical and dental services once as a medical patient on Line 15 and once as a dental patient on Line 19. 17. Which provider types and what activity are included in the addendum? Medical provider s who provide mental health or substance use treatment are included in the addendum. Mental health providers who provide substance use treatment are also included in the addendum. Examples of provider activity reported in the addendum include: A physician who sees a patient for treatment of depression. An NP seeing a patient for diabetes who is also showing signs of anxiety . A PA providing MAT services to a patient with opioid use disorder. A licensed clinical psychologist seeing a patient for mental health problems exacerbated by a substance use disorder.

UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 70 2021 UDS | Instructions for Table 6A Instructions for Table 6A: Selected Diagnoses and Services Rendered This table collects data on selected diagnose s and selected services rendered. The data source for this table is your billing system, lab reports, and/or other information captured in your HIT systems or EHRs. Table 6A does not reflect the full range of diagnoses and services rendered by a health center. The selected diagnoses and services represent those that are prevalent among Health Center Program patients, have been regarded as sentinel indicators of access to primary care, or are of special interest to HRSA. Some diagnosis and service codes have been updated. Changes are included in the table and outlined in the Table 6A Code Changes file found at the UDS t raining website . In addition, a new line has been added to report COVID-19 vaccines provided to health center patients (previously reported in Appendix E) . SELECTED DIAGNOSES , LINES 1-20F Lines 1 through 20f present the name and applicable ICD -10-CM codes for the diagnosis or diagnostic range/group. Wherever possible, diagnoses have been grouped into code ranges. Report all visits (both in-person clinic and virtual) and patients where the provider -assigned diagnostic code is included in the range/group of ICD -10-CM codes shown in the given line . Report diagnoses that were made as part of documented, countable visits with licensed or credentialed medical, dental, mental health, substance use disorder , or vision provider s only. Report all diagnoses rendered at a specific visit. However, DO NOT count \"active diagnoses\" present at the time of a visit but not addressed during the visit. Use age at time of visit for diagnoses with specified age ranges. DO NOT report a diagnosis visit by an other professional or enabling service provider . DO NOT report a diagnosis when it is listed, but not diagnosed or treated . Selected Diagnoses Visits and Patients, Column s A and B Column A, Number of Visits by Diagnosis Regardless of Primacy Report the total number of visits (in -person clinic and/or virtual) during the calendar year where the indicated diagnosis , regardless of primacy, is listed in the HIT/EHR or visit/billing record. Report on Lines 1- 20f each included diagnosis made at a visit, regardless of the number of diagnoses listed for the visit. For example, count a patient visit with a diagnosis of hypertension and a diagnosis of diabetes once on Line 9 and once on Line 11. Column B, Number o f Patients with Diagnosis Report each patient who had one or more visits (in -person clinic and/or virtual) during the year that were reported in the corresponding cell in Column A. Report a patient only once on any given l ine, regardless of the number of visits made for that specific diagnosis or family of diagnoses. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 71 for Table 6A SELECTED TESTS/SCREENINGS , LINES 21-26D Lines 21 through 26d the and applicable ICD -10-CM diagnostic , HCPCS, and/or CPT procedure codes for selected tests, screenings, and preventive services. On several lines, CPT codes, HCPCS, and ICD-10- CM codes are provided. Use either the CPT codes or HCPCS or the ICD-10-CM codes for any specific visit, not all code types . Report all visits meeting the selection criteria that are provided to a health center patient, part of a countable visit, or as follow -up to a countable visit. Only report tests or procedure s (e.g., mammograms, X -rays, tomography) that are: o performed by t he health center, or o not performed by the health center, but paid for by the health center, or o not performed by the health center or paid for by the health center, but whose results are returned to the health center provider to evaluate and provide results to the patient. During a visit with the provider, selected screenings or tests may be ordered . Report only completed services in this section even if they were done at a later date. Use age at time of visit for diagnoses and tests with specified age ranges. Not e: ICD-10 -CM codes for some services (such as mammography and Pap tests ) are listed to ensure capture of procedures that are done by the health center but may be coded with a different CPT code for state reimbursement under Title X or BCCCP. In some instances, payers (especially governmental payers) and labs ask health centers to use different codes for services. In these instances, health centers should internally map these codes to the specified list for reporting purposes. Selected Tests/Screenings Visits and Patients, Columns A and B Column A, Number of Visits Report the total number of visits (in -person clinic and/or virtual) for which one or more of the listed diagnostic tests, screenings, and/or preventive services were provided at the time of a visit or subsequent to a visit. Codes for these services may either be diagnostic (ICD -10-CM) codes or procedure (CPT or HCPCS ) codes. During a single visit, more than one test, screening, or preventive service may be provided. Report each on the applicable line. If they are on the same line, report only one visit. Column B, Number of Patients Report patients who had a visit (in -person clinic and/ or virtual) during the calendar year for which one or more of the selected diagnostic tests, screenings, and/or preventive services listed on Lines 21 -26d were provided. Report patients who received more than one type of service during a single visit on each ap plicable line. For example, if a patient had a Pap test and contraceptive management during the same visit, this patient would be counted on both Lines 23 and 25. Report a patient only once per service, regardless of the number of times a patient receives a given service. For example, an infant who has an immunization at each of several well-child visits in the year has each visit reported in Column A but is counted only once in Column B. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET | Instructions for Table 6A Note: Include follow -up services related to a countable visit. Thus, if a provider asks that a patient return in 30 days for a flu shot, when that patient presents, the shot is counted because it is legally considered to be a part of the initial visit. DO NOT report an encounter with an individual who is not a health center patient who comes in just for a flu shot during a health center -run flu clinic and without a specific referral from a prior visit. DENTAL SERVICES , LINES 27-34 Lines 27 through 34 present the name and applicable Amer ican Dental Association (ADA) procedure codes for selected dental services. These services may be performed only by a dental provider who is reported on Lines 16- 17a on Table 5 or by an in- scope dental contractor paid by the health center . Wherever appropr iate, services have been grouped into code ranges. For these lines, the concept of a \"primary\" code is neither relevant nor us ed. All services are reported. Dental Services Visits and Patients, Columns A and B Column A, Number of Visits Report the total number of visits at which one or more of the listed diagnostic tests, screenings, and/or dental services were provided. During one visit, more than one test, screening, or dental service may be provided. Report each procedure, screening, or test on each separate, applicable line. If they are on the same line, report only one visit. For example, if a patient had more than one tooth filled during a visit, report only one visit for restorative services (Line 32), not one visit per tooth. Column B, Number of Patients Report patients who had at least one visit with a dental professional during the calendar year for each of the selected dental services listed. Only report services that are provided at or as follow -up to countable visits (e.g., a comprehensive oral exam). Report a patient who had two teeth repaired and sealants applied during a single visit once on Line 30 and once on Line 32. DO NOT report services provided by personnel other than a licensed dentist, dental hygienist, dental therapist , or perso nnel working under their direct supervision . DO NOT report fluoride treatments or varnishes that are applied outside of a comprehensive treatment plan, including when provided as part of a community service at schools, on this table or as a visit on Table 5. SERVICES PROVIDED BY MULTIPLE ENTITIES Take care when multiple entities are involved with a service . Use the following rules and general examples to guide reporting: Report the service if a health center provider orders and performs the service. For example, count a rapid HbA1c test ordered by a health center provider and performed in the health center lab. If the health center provider orders a test (e.g., HIV test) and the sample is collected at the health center and then sent to a reference lab for processing, report the test regardless of whether the test is paid for by the patient, the patient's insurance company, 9 a government entity, or the health center. 9 Billing rules require that the charge for a lab test ordered by a provider be sent directly to a third party (including Medicaid and Medicare) and not to the provider or the health center. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 73 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 6A Report a test when the health center provider asks a patient to get that test from a third party and the health center provider receives and reviews the test results with the patient. For example, report mammograms performed by a third-party provider that a health center contracts with and for which the health center reviews the result with the patient. DO NOT report vaccinations performed by a health department when patients are referred to a city or county health department and the health center does not pay for the service, including referrals where a third party (e.g., the patient's insurance company) will make the payment. DO NOT report a test or service that a provider asks the patient to get from a third -party provider (e.g., an HIV test referred to a Ryan White program) that does not bill the health center, including referrals where a third party (e.g., the patient's insurance company) will make the payment if the test or service results are reviewed and acted on by the third -party provider . For example, DO NOT count mammograms performed by the county health department for which the county will follow up with the patient directly and the health center did not pay for the service. (These are generally noted in Column III: Formal Written Referral Arrangement [Health center DOES NOT pay] of Form 5A: Services Provided ). FAQ S FOR TABLE 6A 1. If a case manager or health educator serves a patient who, for example, has diabetes, we often report that diagnostic code for the visit. Should we report this on Table 6A? No. Report on Table 6A only visits with medical, dental, mental health, substance use disorder, and vision providers who are diagnosing according to their own field. 2. The instructions for t his table call for diagnoses and services at visits. If we provide the service but it is not counted as a visit (such as an immunization given at a health fair), should it be reported on this table? Report the visit if a service is provided because of a p rescription or plan from an earlier counted visit , such as if a provider asks a patient to come back in four months for a mammogram. DO NOT report services given at health fairs to an individual who is not a health center patient , regardless of who provide s the service or the level of documentation that is done, such as an HIV test at a health fair . DO NOT report services that are self-referrals where no clinical visit is necessary or provided, such as an individual coming in for a flu shot. 3. Some diagnostic and/or procedure codes in our system are different from the codes listed. What do we do? It is possible that information for Table 6A is not available using the codes shown because of idiosyncrasies in state or clinic billing systems. Gene rally, these involve situations where (a) the state uses unique billing codes other than the normal CPT code for state billing purposes (e.g., EPSDT) or (b) internal or state confidentiality rules mask certain diagnostic data. The following table provides examples of problems and solutions: Line Problem Potential Solution 1 HIV diagnoses are kept confidential, and alternative diagnostic codes are used. Include the alternative codes used at your center on these lines as well. 23 Pap tests are charged to a state BCCCP using a special code. Add these special codes to the other codes listed. 26 Well -child visits are charged to the state EPSDT program using a special code (often starting with W, X, Y, or Z). Add these special codes to the other codes listed a nd count all such visits. DO NOT count EPSDT follow -up visits in this category. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 74 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 6A 4. The instructions specifically say that the source of information for Table 6A is \"billing systems or HITs.\" There are some services for which we DO NOT bill and/or for which there are no visits in our system. What do we do? Although health centers are only required to report data derived from billing systems or HITs, the reported data may understate services in the circumstances described below. In today's EHRs, diagnoses and/or services should be captured in one of the templates available. To more accurately reflect the level of service, use other codes in the system to enable the tracking. DO NOT report referrals for which you DO NOT pay or evaluate results and provide back to the patient (e.g., sending patients to the county health department for mammograms). Line Problem Potential Solution 21 HIV test samples are collected by us but processed and paid for by the state and DO NOT show on the visit form or in the billing system. Preferred: Use the correct code, but report a zero charge. Alternative: Use documented completed lab results returned to the health center. Multiple Tests (HIV tests, Pap tests, etc.) are ordered and sampl es collected by us. We send samples to a reference lab for processing, but the lab bills Medicaid or Medicare directly. Preferred: Use the correct code, but report a zero charge. Alternative: Use documented completed lab results returned to the health cent er. 22 Mammograms are paid for by us but are conducted by a contractor and DO NOT show in the billing system for individual patients. Preferred: Use the correct code, but report a zero charge. Alternative: Use the bills from the independent contractor to identify the mammograms conducted and the patients who received them and report these numbers. 23 Pap tests are processed and paid for by the state and DO NOT show on the visit form or in the billing system. Preferred: Use the correct code, but report a zero charge. 24 Flu shots and other vaccinations are not counted because the vaccines are obtained at no cost to the health center. Preferred: Use the correct code, but report a zero charge. Alternative: Use documented completed lab results returned to the health center. 25 Contraceptive management is funded under Title X or a state family planning program and does not have a Z30- diagnosis or ICD V25 - attached to it. Preferred: Add a \"dummy code\" you can map to the Z30- or V25- code . Alternative: Code with both the Z30- (or V25 -) and the state-mandated code, but suppress printing of the Z30 - or V25- code. Take care not to count the same visit twice. 5. Are we required to report all diagnoses and services rendered during a visit? Yes and no. No, because there are many diagnoses that may be used but not reported on Table 6A. Yes, because documentation and reporting of all diagnoses (not just primary diagnosis) and services rendered during all UDS -countable visits are required. It is important that you appropriately document the breadth of comprehensive services delivered during each visit, including behavioral health services provided during a medical visit (e.g., SBIRT and/or treatment and counseling for mental health and substance use diso rders). 6. What happens if the CPT, HCPCS, or ICD-10-CM codes change again? The codes are reviewed annually by the UDS Support Center personnel . If you think a CPT, ICD, HCPCS, or ADA code for a measure is not reflected in the list or has changed , contact th e UDS Support Center at udshelp330@bphcdata.net . Personnel will review the code(s) with BPHC and incorporate approved changes to codes in the manual for future reporting. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 75 2021 UDS | Instructions for Table 6A 7. Are there ICD-10-CM codes for PrEP management? No. Health centers could use t he following codes to help identify patient visits that may include counseling on or initiation of PrEP or that may be associated with currently prescribed PrEP, based on risk for HIV exposure . 276237, 322248, 495430 Please note, this Limit to emtricitabine , or RxNORM codes on Table 6A. They only serve as a recommendation to help health centers identify reportable PrEP management . 8. Should suspected, possible, probable , or inconclusive SARS -CoV-2 ( novel coronavirus) disease screening and/or tests be reported as diagnosed? No. If the provider documents \"suspected,\" \"possible,\" \"probable,\" or \"inconclusive\" coronavirus (SARS - CoV-2) disease, DO NOT assign code U07.1 and DO NOT report the patient as having this diagnosis. Only report confirmed novel coronavirus cases. 9. If a patient presents to the health center with pneumonia or other health conditions caused by coronavirus (SARS -CoV- 2) disease, is the other health condition reported on Table 6A? Assign code U07.1 and the appropriate ICD-10 code associated with the other health condition. Documentation in the patient's health record and reporting of all diagnoses (not just primary diagnosis) and services rendered during the visit are required, if applicable. For example, if a patient has pneumonia confirmed due to coronavirus (SARS -CoV-2) disease, assign and report codes U07.1 (coronavirus disease) on Line 4c and J12.89 (other viral pneumonia) on L ine 6a . 10. We DO NOT perform some services and tests and refer these out. Can we count these? Possibly. If you perform the service, or if you DO NOT perform the service or test but paid another provider to provide the requested service, or if the results are returned to the health center provider to evaluate and provide results back to the patient, you may report these services. The following examples illustrate these rules: Report a Pap test specimen collected by the health center but read by an outside pathologist who then bills a third party. Report a blood draw performed by the health center and sent to an outside lab who then bills Medicaid and sends the results back to the health center. DO NOT report the referral of a patient to the local hospital or county health department for a mammogram where the local hospital or county health department providers perform the test and provide results direct ly to the patient. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 76 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 6A 11. Can we count patients on multiple lines if they had more than one type of service at a visit ? If patients receive multiple services at one visit and the services are reflected on this table, you may repor t the patient and visit on each a pplicable line. The following examples illustrate these rules: Report a patient with hypertension who also receives an HIV test on L ine 11 (hypertension) and on Line 21 (HIV test). If both an HIV test and a Pap test were provided during a visit, then report a visit on both Line 21 (HIV test) and Line 23 (Pap test). If a patient receives multiple immunizations at one visit, report only one visit on Line 24. Report a patient who comes in for an annual physical and a flu shot.

If you submit Grant Reports, the total number of patients and visits reported on the grant table must be less than or equal to the corresponding number on the Universal Report for each cell. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 82 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Tables 6B and 7 Instructions for Tables 6B and 7 Tables 6B and 7 collect data on selected quality of care and clinical health outcome and disparity measures. BPHC first implemented these measures in 2008 and continues to updat e them. BPHC will continue to revise and expand these measures consistent with the National Quality Strategy , CMS electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs) , and other national quality initiatives. The clinical quality measures (CQMs) described in this manual must be reported by all health centers using specifications detailed in the measure definitions described below. The majority of the UDS clinical quality measures are aligned with CMS 2021 Performance Period Eligible Professional/Eligible Clinical e CQMs . Use the most current CMS-issued eCQM specifications for the eCQM number and version referenced in the UDS Manual for 2021 reporting and measurement period. Although there are other year and version updates available from CMS , they are not to be used for 2021 reporting. Note: The phrase \"measurement period\" used in this section is intended to represent calendar year 202 1 unless another timeframe is specifically noted. For UDS clinical quality measure reporting, include and evaluate patients for the denominator who had a t least one medical visit during the measurement period as specified in the measure (d ental visits during the measurement period are used for the dental sealant measure), even though some eCQMs may specify a broader range of service codes (e.g., mental health, substance use disorder). The measure specifications can be found at the CMS Electronic Clinical Quality Improvement ( eCQI ) Resource Center .10 The eCQM measure numbers and links are provided to assist you, whe n applicable. F urther clarification or interpretation of CMS e CQMs may be provided by the measure steward (listed in Appendix G). Additionally, the use of official versions of vocabulary value sets as contained in the Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)11 is encouraged for health centers capable of appropriately using this resource as defined to support the data reporting of these clinical quality measures. Note: CMS uses logic statements describing the criteria for eCQM rep orting using Clinical Quality Language (CQL) in an effort to standardize reporting workflows. Health centers are advised to review workflows and to work with HIT/EHR vendors and IT personnel to ensure that required data are being captured correctly to calculate measures. COLUMN LOGIC INSTRUCTIONS Column A (A, 2A, or 3A ): Number of Patients in the Denominator Report t he total number of patients who fulfill the detailed criteria described for the specified measure. Report all patients meeting the criteria in the health center's denominator , including all sites (e.g., urgent care, prenatal), all in -scope programs (e.g., targeted programs, special populations), and all providers. 10 Simplified coding and billing requirements for evaluation and management visits went into effect January 1, 2021.

UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA 83 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Tables 6B and 7 Because the denominator for each measure is defined in whole or in part in terms of age (or age and sex assigned at birth), comparisons to the numbers on Table s 3A, 6B, and 7 will be made when evaluating your submission. The numbers in Column A of Table s 6B and 7 will not be equal to those that might be calculated on Table 3A for the following reasons: (1) All patients seen for reportable services (i.e., medical, dental, mental health) are counted on Table 3A, but only patients seen for medical care (or dental for the one dental measure) are considered for the clinical quality measures reported on Tables 6B and 7. The more dental -, mental health -, or substance use disorder - only patients a health center has, the less comparable the data will be. (2) Table 3A measures age as of June 30 of the calendar year, but Tables 6B and 7 define other time periods (e.g., as of January 1) to measure age. Although comparisons may be made between the numbers on Table 6A and Tables 6B and 7, the numbers in Column A of Tables 6B and 7 will not be equal to those reported in Column B of Table 6A for the following reasons: (1) All patients, regardless of age, seen for all reportable services and diagnoses, are included on Table 6A, but Tables 6B and 7 relate only to patients of specific age ranges. (2) Table 6A reflects diagnose s and services during the calendar year, but in Tables 6B and 7 measures may require patients to be considered based on active diagnoses or a look-back period of completed services. Additionally, birth outcomes on Table 7 are compared to prenatal care patients on Table 6B. Column B (B, 2B, or 3B ): Numb er of Charts/Records Sampled or EHR Total Report the total number of health center patients from the denominator (Column A) for whom data have been reviewed. The number will essentially become the denominator in evaluating the numerator criteria and will be: o all patients who fit the criteria (the same number as the denominator reported in Column A), or o a number equal to or greater than 80 percent12 of all patients who meet the criteria (a value no less than 80 percent of the denominator reported in Column A ), or o a scientifically drawn random sample of 70 patient chart s selected from all patients who fit the criteria. Please refer to Appendix C for specifics on sampling methodology. If a sample is to be used, it must be a random sample of 70 patient charts and must be drawn from the health center's entire patient population during the measurement period identified as belonging in the denominator . Larger samples will not be accepted. Health centers may not choose to select the same number of charts from each site or the same number for each provider or use other stratification mechanisms because this will result in oversampling some group of patients. 12 To streamline the process for reporting on the CQMs, and to encourage the use of HIT to report on the full denominator of patients, health centers may use all of the records available in the HIT/EHR for any given clinical quality measure in lieu of a chart sample if at least 80 percent of all health center patients' health records are included in the HIT/EHR and the patients missing from the HIT/EHR are not related to any target group or variable involved with that given measure. For example, if the patients from a pediatric service delivery site are missing in the HIT/EHR, it cannot be used for the childhood immunization measure. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 84 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Tables 6B and 7 Use a review of a sample of charts in lieu of full- denominator reporting from an HIT/EHR for any given clinical quality measure if: the HIT/EHR system does not include a minimum of 80 percent of health center patients who meet the criteria described below for inclusion in the specific measure's denominator , the HIT/EHR system does not exclude every health center patient who meets one or more exclusion criteria described below for exclusion from the denominator , the HIT/EHR system has not been in place long enough to be able to find the data required in prior year's activities (look-back period data are necessary for many of the UDS CQMs [ e.g., cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, childhood immunizations ]), or the required data were not collected from the patient as part of the visit or searchable in discrete data fields at the time of the visit. Records for new patients should be obtained from their former providers to document prior treatment, including data for look- back periods. Patient health records obtained from other providers may be recorded in the health center's HIT/EHR system consistent with internal patient health records policies, at which point they may be used in the calculated performance rate for the applicable measure. If the HIT/EHR system is used, the number in Column B (records reviewed) must be no less than 80 percent of the number in Column A when the total denominator is greater than 70. The reduced total (in Column B) may not be the result of excluding patients based on a variable related to the measure. Column C (C or 2C) or 3F: Number of Charts/Records Meeting the Numerator Criteria Report the total number of records (included in the count for Column B) that meet the numerator criteria for the specified clinical quality measure. The number in Column C or F (records in the numerator ) can never exceed the number in Column B (patient health records reviewed). Not e: The percentage of patient health records meeting the numerator criteria can be calculated by dividing Column C or 3F by Column B. Criteria vs. Exceptions and Exclusions in HITs/EHRs vs. Chart Reviews In the information that follows, \"conditions\" or \"criteria\" are at times used interchange ably as \"exceptions\" or \"exclusions.\" This is partly because of the differing language and procedures in an HIT/EHR (or practice management system)-based report versus a chart audit report. I n an HIT/EHR or PMS review, all criteria for a measure must be locat able in the HIT/EHR and must be in the HIT/EHR for each patient at the health center. If they cannot be found, findings will be distort ed and the HIT/EHR can not be used. It is important that the HIT/EHR differentiate s between medical and dental patients and is able to limit to either medical or dental patients as specified in each CQM . In a sample chart review process, items listed as \"criteria\" may be used as \"exclusions.\" In cases where the sample includes a dental-only patient for a CQM that should include medical patients in the denominator , replace the dental -only patient with another medical patient. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 85 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Tables 6B and 7 And vs. Or In this section, conditions lin ked with \" and\" mean that each of the conditions must be met. If some but not all conditions are met, the services for that patient are considered to have failed to meet the numerator criteria . Conditions linked with \"or \" mean that criteria must be evaluated in the order prescribed by the measure steward statements. For example, if the first statement is not met, move to the second, then the third, etc. DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLINICAL QUALITY MEASURES The clinical quality measures (CQMs) reported in the UDS relate only to medical patients (or only to dental patients in the case of one dental measure). Report each measure using the criteria outlined below. Each measure has been organized in the same way to assist with data collection and reporting. Measure Description: T he quantifiable indicator to be evaluated. Denominator : Patients who fit the detailed criteria described for inclusion in the specific measure to be evaluated . Numerator: Records (from the denominator) that meet the criteria for the specified measure . Denominator Exclusions : Patients not to be considered for the measure and who should be removed from the denominator before determining if numerator criteria are met. Denominator Exceptions : Patients removed from the denominator because numerator criteria are not met . Specification Guidance : CMS measure guidance that assists with understanding and implementing eCQMs. UDS Reporting Considerations: Additional BPHC requirements and guidance that must be applied to the specific measure and that may differ from or expand on the eCQM specifications. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 86 2021 UDS | Instructions for Table 6B Instructions for Table 6B: Quality of Care Measures The quality -of-care measures reported on Table 6B are \"process measures. \" This means they doc ument services that have been shown to be correlated with and serve as a proxy for positive long -term health outcomes. Individuals who receive routine preventive care and timely chronic care are more likely to have positive outcomes . Several notable changes have been made to Table 6B, as outlined below: The specifications for the clinical quality measures reported have been revised to align with the CMS eCQMs. The clinical quality measures are aligned with the most current eCQMs for Eligible Professionals for the 2021 version number referenced in the UDS Manual for the measurement period. (Other updates are available, but they should not be used for the 2021 reporting.) The Cervical Cancer Screening measure has removed the cervical cytology requirement for women age 30 and older (HPV test remains). The Tobacco Screening measure numerator changed from a 24-month to a 12-month requirement. TABLE 6B: QUALITY OF CARE MEASURES This table specifically includes the following CQMs : Screen ing and Preventive Care Maternal Care and Children's Health Disease Management Cervical Cancer Screening Breast Cancer Screening Preventive Care and Screening: Body Mass Index (BMI) Screening and Follow- Up Plan Preventive Care and Screening: Tobacco Use: Screening and Cessation Intervention Colorectal Cancer Screening HIV Screening Preventive Care and Screening: Screening for Depression and Follow -Up Plan Early Entry into Prenatal Care Childhood Immunization Status Weight Assessment and Counseling for Nutrition and Physical Activity for Children and Adolescents Dental Sealants for Children between 6 -9 Years Statin Therapy for the Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease Ischemic Vascular Disease (IVD): Use of Aspirin or Another Antiplatelet HIV Linkage to Care Depression Remission at Twelve Months SECTIONS A AND B: DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF PRENATAL CARE PATIENTS This section includes information about patients in the prenatal care program. Report on all patients who are either provided direct prenatal care or referred for prenatal care. Report on the age and trimester of entry into prenatal care for all prenatal care patients, regardless of whether they receive all or some of their prenatal services in the health center or are referred elsewhere. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 87 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 6B DO NOT include patients who had a positive pregnancy test but did not initiate prenatal care with the health center or its referral network . DO NOT include patients who did not receive prenatal care from a health center provider or who were not referred by the health center to another provider for prenatal care. DO NOT include patients who chose to receive all their prenatal care outside of the health center' s referral network. DO NOT include pregnant patients who receive d care unrelated to their pregnancy and who are being seen elsewhere for prenatal care. Prenatal Care by Referral Only (check box) All health centers are required to provide prenatal care to patients, either directly or by referral. Check the \"Prenatal Care by Referral Only\" check box if you provide prenatal care to patients only through direct referral to another provider. DO NOT select this flag if your health center providers provide some or all prenatal care to patients directly . Section A: Age of Prenatal Care Patients (Lines 1 -6) Report the total number of patients by age group who received prenatal care during the calendar year from the health center or from a provider in your referral network . Include all patients receiving any prenatal care, including the delivery of their child, during the calendar year, regardless of when that care was initiated. Include patients who: o receive all their prenatal care from the health center, o were referred by the health center to another provider for all their prenatal care, o began prenatal care with another provider but transferred to the health center at some point during their prenatal care, o began prenatal care with t he health center but were transferred to another provider at some point during their prenatal care, o were provided with all their prenatal care by a health center provider but were delivered by another provider , o began or were referred for care during the previous calendar year or in this calendar year and delivered during the calendar year, or o began or were referred for their care in this calendar year but will not or did not deliver until the next year. To determine the appropriate age group, use the patient's age on June 30 of the calendar year. Not e: As many as half of all prenatal care patients reported will usually have been reported in the prior year or will be reported in the next year. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 88 | Instructions for Table 6B Section B: Early Entry into Prenatal Care (Lines 7 -9), No eCQM Measure Description Percentage of prenatal care patients who entered prenatal care during their first trimester .

Note: It is unusual for the number in Column B to be very large or larger than that in Column A . This is especially true for the third trimester, because it would require patients to have begun care very late and then transfer to the health center in a very short period of time. The sum of the numbers in the six cells of Lines 7 through 9 represents the total number of patients who received prenatal care from the health center during the calendar year and is equal to the number reported on Line 6. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 89 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 6B Use the following criteria to identify how prenatal care patients are reported: o Only report patients who had thei r first comprehensive prenatal exam with the health center or with the referral provider as having begun prenatal care. Health center visits that include pregnancy and other lab tests, dispensing vitamins, taking a health history, and/or obtaining a nutrit ional or psychosocial assessment only DO NOT count as the start of prenatal care. o Determine the trimester by the trimester of pregnancy that the patient was in when they began prenatal care either at one of the health center's service delivery locations or with another provider, including a referral provider. o Report a patient who begins prenatal care with the health center or is referred by the health center to another provider only once in Column A (not Column B) . o Report a patient who begins prenatal care on their own with another provider and then transfers to the health center only once in Column B (not in Column A ). o Patient self -report of trimester of entry is permitted. o Report the patie nt twice as a prenatal care patient in those rare instances when a patient receives prenatal care services for two separate pregnancies in the same calendar year. SECTIONS C THROUGH M: OTHER QUALITY OF CARE MEASURES In these sections, report on the finding s of your reviews of services provided to targeted populations . For s ections C through L, specifically assess the current medical patients (i.e., patients who had a medical visit at least once during the measurement period). DO NOT include patients whose only visits were for dental, mental health, or something other than medical care in the denominator for these measures. For s ection M , assess current dental patients (i.e., patients who had a dental visit at least once during the measurement period). DO NOT include patients whose only visits were for medic al, mental health, or something other than dental care in the denominator for th is measure. For these measures, calculate age using the specified dates as required for each e CQM. Age is generally the patient's age prior to the start of January 1 of the calendar year. Using the specified criteria , include patients seen for medical care even if the only care provided was in an urgent care setting , if patients were seen only once for acute care, if patients were seen only for specialty care, or if the patient has since left the practice. For measures requir ing the completion of screening s, tests, or procedures to meet the numerator criteria, the findings of the screenings , test results, or procedures must be documented in the patient health record . Not e: In this section, the term \"measurement period\" is the timeframe specified by the measure steward .

UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 91 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 6B UDS Reporting Considerations Include children who turned 2 years of age during the measurement period, regardless of whe n they were seen for medical care during the year. Specifically , include them in the assessment whether the medical visit in the year occurred before or after they turned 2. Include children in the denominator if they came to the health center for well -child13 services or for any other medical visits , including treatment of an injury or illness. Include children in the denominator for whom no vaccination information is available and/or who were first seen at a point when there was not enough time to fully immunize them prior to their second birthday. Include children who had a contraindication for a specific vaccine in the denominator . Count them as being \"compliant\" for that specific vaccine, if the guidance (Specification Guidance) permits it, and then review for the administration of the rest of the vaccines. To meet the numerator criteria, a child 's health record must be documented as being compliant for each vaccine. Registries can be used to fill any voids in the immunization record if the search is r outinely done prior to or immediately after a visit and before the end of the measurement period. For example, you may use an immunization registry maintained by the state or other public entity that shows comparable information. Do not include patients here or anywhere on the UDS who only received a vaccination and never received other services. Do not count as meeting the numerator criteria charts that only state that the \" patient is up to date\" with all immunizations and that DO NOT list the dates of all immunizations and the names of immunization agents. DO NOT count toward the numerator criteria verbal assurance from a parent or other individual that a vaccine has been given.

An eligible professional or their personnel is required to measure both height and weight. Both height and weight must be measured within 12 months of the current encounter and may be obtained from separate visits. BMI may be documented in the patient health record at the health center or in outside patient health records obtained by the health center . If more than one BMI is reported during the measurement period, use the most recent BMI to determine if the numerator criteria has been met. Document the follow -up plan based on the most recent documented BMI outside of normal parameters. Documented medical reasons include, but are not limited to: o Elderly patients (65 years or older) for whom weight reduction or gain would complicate other underlying health conditions, such as the following examples: Illness or physical disability Mental illness, dementia, confusion Nutritional deficiency, such as vitamin or mineral deficiency DO NOT use self -reported height and weight values. UDS Reporting Considerations Documentation in the patient health record must show the actual BMI , or the template normally viewed by a provider must display BMI. DO NOT count as meeting the numerator criteria c harts or templates that display only height and weight. The fact that an HIT/EHR can calculat e BMI does not replace the presence of the BMI itself.

Exclusions/Exceptions Denominator Exclusions o Not applicable Denominator Exceptions o Documentation of medical reason(s) for not screening for tobacco use or for not providing tobacco cessation intervention (e.g., limited life expectancy, other medical reason) Specification Guidance If patient s use any type of tobacco (i.e., smokes or uses smokeless tobacco), tobacco cessation intervention (counseling and/or pharmacotherapy ) is expected . In order to promote a team-based approach to patient care, the tobacco cessation intervention can be performed by another health care provider; therefore, the tobacco use screening and tobacco cessation intervention DO NOT need to be performed by the same provider. If a patient has multiple tobacco use screenings during the 12-month period, use the most recent screening that has a documented status of tobacco user or non -user. If tobacco use status of a patient is unknown, th e patient does not meet the screening component required to be counted in the numerator and has not met the numerator criteria . \"Unknown\" include s patients who were not screened or patients with indefinite answer s. If the patient does not meet the screening component of the numerator but has an allowable medical exception, remove the patient from the denominator. The medical reason exception applies to the screening data element of the measure or to any of the tobacc o cessation intervention (counseling and/or pharmacotherapy) data elements. If a patient has a diagnosis of limited life expectancy, that patient has a valid denominator exception for not being screened for tobacco use or for not receiving tobacco use cessation intervention (counseling and/or pharmacotherapy) if identified as a tobacco user. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), including electronic cigarettes for tobacco cessation, are not currently classified as tobacco. They are n ot evaluated for this measure. UDS Reporting Considerations Report in the numerator records that demonstrate that the patient had been asked about their use of all forms of tobacco within 12 months before the end of the measurement period. Cessation counseling intervention for a tobacco user must occur at or following the most recent screening and before the end of the calendar year .

On which line do we count patients who began prenatal care during the first trimester ? Report the patient on Line 7, depending on if they began their care with the health center or with a non- health center provider. If the patient began prenatal care during the first trimester at the health center's service delivery location or with a provi der to which the health center referred the patient, report the patient on Line 7 in Column A. If the patient received prenatal care from another provider during the first trimester before coming to the health center's service delivery location, report the patient on Line 7 in Column B, regardless of when the patient begins care with the health center. 2. A child came in only once during the year for an injury and never returned for well-child care. D o we have to consider the child's chart to not have met the numerator criteria since we only treated for the injury ? Yes. After a patient enters a health center's system of medical care, the center is expected to provide all needed preventive health care and/or document that the patient has received it. Report the patient in the denominator but not the numerator, since the record did not meet the numerator criteria. 3. Is the Pap test review for women starting at age 21 or at age 23? For this measure, look only at women who were age 23 through age 64 at some point in t he measurement period. Because the measure asks about Pap tests administered in 2021, 2020, or in 2019, it is possible that a 23-year-old woman assessed under this measure would have been 21 in 2019. If the patient received a Pap test in that year, the pat ient would be considered to have met the numerator criteria. Although you look only at women who are 23 through 64, their qualifying test may have been done when they were 21 through 64. 4. What if a patient we treat for hypertension and diabetes goes to an OB/GYN in the community for reproductive health care? Do we still have to consider the patient in the denominator for the cervical cancer screening measure? What if we DO NOT offer Pap tests? After the patient has been seen in your clinic, you are responsible for ensuring that they have the appropriate cervical cancer screening. This can be done by providing the Pap test or documenting the results of a test that someone else performed. Health centers are encouraged to coordinate care and document Pap test results by contacting providers. The health center may obtain a copy of the patient's test result to include in their patient health record for future care. Consider the patient as part of the denominator for the cervical cancer screening measure if they received any medical visit(s) in the measurement period. If there is no evidence of a timely cervical cancer screening included in their patient health record , consider this as not having met the numerator criteria . 5. If we inform parents of the importance of immunizations but they refuse to have their child immunized, may we count the patient health record as having met the numerator criteria if the refusal is documented? No. A child is fully immu nized only if there is documentation that the child received the vaccine or there is contraindication for the vaccine, evidence of the antigen, or history of illness. Refusal does not meet the exclusion criteria. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 109 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 6B 6. Are parents required to bring to the health center documentation of childhood immunizations received outside the health center? Parents are encouraged to provide documentation of immunizations that their children received elsewhere, but other mechanisms of obtaining this information are also acceptable as long as all immunizations are appropriately reviewed and documented in your system. Document childhood immunizations by contacting providers of immunizations directly to obtain documentation by fax, by requesting health center patients mail a copy of their immunization history, through receipt of payment for the vaccine from the pharmacy, by finding the child in a state or county immunization registry, or through other appropriate means. 7. Some of the immunization details are different from those used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Clinic Assessment Software Application (CASA) or Comprehensive-CASA reviews of our clinic. May we use these CDC standards to report on the UDS? No. HRSA is now using the CMS eCQM standards to evaluate provision of vaccines to children. Using a different set of standards will distort the data. A health center may use a different set of standards for its own internal QI/quality assurance program, but these may not be substituted for the UDS repor ting requirements . 8. We want to use data from the clinical quality measures to compare our service delivery sites and our providers to one another. As a result, we would like to use a larger sample size. Is this permitted? No. A sample size of 70 patient hea lth records must be used. This facilitates the development of state, national, and other roll -up reports. Additionally, any change in the sample size would bias the sample and provide distortions in the data set. Most health center systems can provide these results without modifying the reporting requirements. 9. Does \"counseling for nutrition and . . . physical activity\" include specific content that must be provided? Does it need to be provided if the child is within the normal range? No, the counseling has no specific required content, although it does have specific CPT coding requirements. It is tailored by the provider given the patient's BMI percentile and other clinical and social data. Yes, the counseling must be provided to all children and adolescents. Counseling is aimed at promoting routine physical activity and healthy eating for all children and adolescents. For younger children, counseling will be provided to the parent or caregiver. 10. For adult patients, our protocol calls f or weight to be measured at every visit but height to be measured \"at least once every 2 years.\" Is this acceptable? BMI is calculated from current height and weight. Both height and weight must be measured within 12 months of the most recent visit and may be obtained from separate visits. 11. The tobacco screening measure says that there must be intervention for tobacco users. What specific interventions must be used? A broad range of counseling and pharmacotherapy is available for tobacco use. Which intervent ion to use is at the discretion of each provider. 12. Do quit lines meet the numerator criteria for tobacco cessation? Yes. Tobacco cessation services provided by quit lines do meet the numerator criteria for the tobacco screening and cessation intervention measure if the intervention is documented in the patient's health record . UDS SUPPORT 330@ BPHCDATA 110 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 6B 13. How should we collect data for measures that require a look -back period? Many of the UDS CQMs (e.g., cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screenin g, childhood immunizations, others) require a look -back period (reference to historical data prior to the measurement period) . It is important that this information is noted in patient health records. It is recommended that you obtain records for new patients from their former providers to document their prior treatment, including data for look- back periods. Patient health records obtained from other providers may be recorded in the health center's HIT/EHR consistent with internal patient health record policies, at which point they could be used in the performance review. Additionally, if you change EHRs, ensure that the prior data is transferred to the new system. 14. Can we use National Quality Forum (NQF) or Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) directly to report on the clinical quality measures? No. For UDS reporting, you must report on the clinical quality measures defined by UDS and outlined in this manual, most of which align with CMS's Promoting Interoperability eCQMs. 15. Which patients are we required to report in the denominator for the dental sealants measure? Health centers providing dental services directly on -site or through paid referral under contract must report on all dental patients age 6 through 9 at the start of the measurement period who are at elevated risk for caries in the denominator . Caries risk assessment must be based on patient -level factors and documented with appropriate ADA codes. This may not be based on population -based factors, such as low socioeconomic status. 16. Do DNA colorectal cancer screening tests meet the numerator criteria for the colorectal cancer screening measure? Yes. FIT -DNA colorectal cancer screening tests (such as Cologuard) meet the numerator criteria for the colorectal cancer screening measure when performed during the measur ement period or in the 2 years prior. 17. What should we do if we DO NOT have adequate documentation about the tooth on which a sealant was placed? In these situations, pull 70 patient health records using a random sample and have the reviewer evaluate the patient health records to find evidence for the sealant being applied to a permanent first molar. If the tooth descriptor (or tooth number) is undocumented and there is insufficient documentation to determine whether at least one sealant was placed on a permanent first molar, the patient health record will not be included in the numerator and may lower the overall measure score (percentage). 18. If a patient who is newly diagnosed with HIV dies before they receive treatment, do we count them in the HIV linkage to care measure? Yes. Include t he patient in the denominator , assuming they met the diagnosis criteria. If they died before receiving the first visit for initiation of treatment, DO NOT count them in the numerator . 19. Can brand-name prescriptions meet the numerator criteria for measures that include a pharmaceutical component? Yes. Since only scientific or generic names are stored in the RxNORM value sets, the health center and vendor need to map the generic and brand names when a new equivalent or brand name is discovered missing from RxNORM. 20. What does \" diagnosis that overlaps the measurement period \" mean, as stated for some of the measures? The overlap statement means that if patients had the diagnosis at any point during the measurement period, they are to be included in the denominator and assessed for meeting the numerator criteria. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 111 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 6B 21. We would like to recommend changes to specific eCQM requirements being collected in the UDS. Can HRSA make the changes based on our feedback? Although HRSA is interested in learning about eCQM changes you would recommend, you should contact the measure steward through the ONC Issue Tracking System to submit recommendations to existing eCQM logic. Appendix G contains the list of measure stewards. 22. What standardized depression screenings comply with the Screening for Depression and Follow -Up Plan measure? Use a standardized depression screening tool, which is a normalized and validated tool developed for the patient population in which it is to be utilized. Examples of depression screening tools include, but a re not limited to those listed in the following chart: Adolescent Screening Tools (12-17 years) Adult Screening Tools (18 years and older)

UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 116 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 7 Instructions for Table 7: Health Outcomes and Disparities The health outcome and disparity measures reported on Table 7 are \"clinical process and outcome measures,\" which means they document measurable outcomes of clinical intervention as a surrogate for good long-term health outcomes. Increasing the proportion of health center patients who have a good intermediate health outcome generally leads to improved health status of the patient population in the future. The specifications for the clinical quality measures reported have been revised to align with the CMS eCQMs. The clinical quality care measures are aligned with the most current eCQMs for Eligible Professionals for the 2021 version number referenced in the UDS Manual for the measurement period. (Other updates are available, but they should not be used for the 2021 reporting.) TABLE 7: HEALTH OUTCOMES AND DISPARITIES MEASURES This table specifically includes the following CQMs: Maternal Care and Children's Health Disease Management Low Birth Weight Controlling High Blood Pressure Diabetes: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Poor Control (>9.0%) RACE AND ETHNICITY REPORTING Table 7 reports health outcome data by race and Hispanic or Latino /a ethnicity to provide information on health centers' efforts to reduce health disparities. Race and Hispanic or Latino /a ethnicity is self -reported by patients and should be collected as part of a standard registration process. Care must be taken by health centers that have separate reporting systems for patient registration and clinical data to ensure race and ethnicity data across the systems are aligned. Because the initial patient population for each measure is defined in terms of race and ethnicity , comparisons to the numbers on Table s 3B and 7 will be made when evaluating your submission. See the crosswalk of comparable fields in Appendix B . Health centers that report on a sample of patients are cautioned against using their data to evaluate disparities in their own systems given small sample sizes. On a national level, however, reported data permits HRSA to evaluate the impact of health center services on disparate outcomes for target populations.

On this line ONLY, include deliveries, regardless of outcome, of any patient , regardless of whether or not they were part of the health center's prenatal care program during the calendar year. Include such circumstances as: o the delivery of another doctor's patients when the health center provider participates in a cal l group and is on call at the time of delivery , o emergency deliveries when the health center provider is on call for the emergency room , o deliveries of \"undoctored\" patients performed by a health center provider as a requirement for pri vileging at a hospital , and o deliveries by any provider who is considered to be the health center 's personnel during the delivery. DO NOT include deliveries for which a clinic provider separately bills, receives, and retains payment for the delivery. DELIVERIES AND BIRTH WEIGHT DATA BY RACE AND HISPANIC OR LATINO /A ETHNICITY , COLUMNS 1A-1D Report on all prenatal care patients who are either provided direct care or referred for care. Report all health center patients who delivered during the calendar year and all babies born to them in Columns 1a -1d.

Obtain race and ethnicity of babies from their registration forms, their birth certificates, or from their parent. No sampling is permit ted on this measure. Prenatal Care Patients and Referred Prenatal Care Patients Who Delivered During the Year (Column 1a) Report all health center prenatal care patients who delivered during the calendar year , including those who health center personnel cared for and delivered and those who had some or all of their care provided by a referral provider. This column collects data on \"patients who delivered.\" Report only one patient as having delivered, even if the delivery results in multiple births (e.g., twins or triplets ), or is a stillbirth. Include all patients who had deliveries, regardless of the outcome. DO NOT include deliveries when you have no documentation that the delivery occurred (patients lost to inadequate follow -up).

Include neonatal demises. If the delivery is of multiple babies (e. g., twins or triplets), report the birth weight of each baby separately. Report data regardless of whether the health center did the delivery or referred the delivery to another provider, and regardless of whether the patient transferred to another provider on their own. Follow -up on all patients is required. In rare instances, there may be no birth outcomes recorded although there may be evidence (i.e. , records indicate delivery occurred) that the patient delivered. Report the patient as having delivered (Co lumn 1a) with no birth outcomes (Columns 1b- 1d). The number of deliveries reported in Column 1a will normally be different than the total number of babies reported in Columns 1b- 1d because of multiple births and stillbirths.

SECTIONS B AND C: OTHER HEALTH OUTCOME AND DISPARITY MEASURES In these sections, report the findings of reviews of services provided to targeted populations . Sections B and C specifically assess the health center 's current medical patients (i.e., patients who had a medical visit at least once during the calendar year ). Using the specified criteria , include patients seen for medical care even if the only care provided was in an urgent care setting , if patients were seen only once for acute care, or if patients were seen only for specialty care. DO NOT include patients whose only visits were for dental, mental health, or something other than medical care. For measures that require the completion of tests or procedures to meet the numerator criteria, test results or procedures must be evidenced by documented results. Patient -self report is not accepted. Not e: In this section, the term \"measurement period\" is the timeframe specified by the measure steward. For measures not electronically specified, this is intended to capture calendar year 2021 d ata. 21 However, during the review of the UDS Report, reviewers may question unusually high or low proportion of low-birth-weight babies for individual race or ethnicity categories.

Only include patients with a n active diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes in the denominator of this measure. DO NOT include patients with a diagnosis of secondary diabetes due to another condition (such as gestational diabetes) in the denominator. UDS Reporting Considerations Report patients who have an active diagnosis of diabetes even if their medical visits during the year were unrelated to the diagnosis. Even if the treatment of the patient's diabetes has been referred to a non -health center provider, the health center is expected to have the current lab test results in its records. Although data are provided for each race and ethnicity category, the measure looks only at the totals. Note: T his is a \"negative\" measure: T he lower the number of adult patients with diabetes with poor diabetes control, the better the performance on the measure. FAQ S FOR TABLE 7 1. When would we use Line h, \"Unreported/Refused to Report\" race and ethnicity? Use Line h only in those instances where patients DO NOT provide their race and DO NOT state whether they are Hispanic or Latino/a. Report patients who provide a race but DO NOT affirmatively answer a question about Hispanic or Latino/a ethnicity as Non -Hispanic or Latino/a on the appropriate race line (Lines 2a-2g). Report patients who indicate they are Hispanic or Latino/a but DO NOT provide a race on Line 1g. 2. Data are requested by race and Hispanic or Latino/a ethnicity. How are these to be coded? Report race and Hispanic or Latino/a ethnicity on this table in the same manner reported on Table 3B. Refer to instructions for Table 3B for further information describing race and ethnicity categories. Ensure the same information is recorded in both the patient health record and the registration form to avoid errors. 3. Are patients with diabetes required to bring to the health center documentation of HbA1c tests received from outside the health center? The health center is required to have HbA1c test results in patient he alth records. If the health center does not perform the test, contact the provider who performed the tests. The documentation can be brought in by the patient, but can also be obtained by fax, by requesting that the patient mail a copy of test results, or through other appropriate means. 4. We want to use the data from the clinical quality measures to compare our service delivery sites and our providers to one another. As a result, we would like to use a larger sample size. Is this permitted? A sample size of 70 charts must be used for UDS reporting . This facilitates the development of state, national, and other roll -up reports. Additionally, any change in the sample size would bias the sample and provide distortions in the data set. Most health center systems can provide these results without modifying the reporting requirements. Health centers can use larger sample sizes for their own tracking and QI projects outside of UDS. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 123 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 7 5. In Section A, Deliveries and Birth Outcomes, should the race and ethnicity of the baby be the same as that of the mother? Not necessarily . Report the race and ethnicity of the mother (Column 1a) separately from that of the baby (Column 1b, 1c, or 1d). The baby's race and ethnicity may differ from the mother 's. 6. How do we report miscarriages and pregnancy terminations on this table ? You don't. Report all pregnant patients in your prenatal care program (direct or by referral) on Table 6B, but report only those patients who deliver on Table 7. Consider a stillbirth to be a delivery for purposes of reporting in Column 1a, but DO NOT report the baby by birthweight in Columns 1b, 1c, or 1d. 7. How do we determine \"active diagnosis\" that is required for some measures? Patient health records frequently contain a \"problem list,\" a list of \"active diagnoses,\" or lists by other names. Any diagnosis on the list for part or all of the calendar year is considered \"active.\" 8. Can we use our population health management system to report on the eCQMs? Possibly.

FACILITY AND NON-CLINICAL SUPPORT SERVICES ALLOCATION INSTRUCTIONS There are multiple ways that facility and non -clinical support services (Lines 14 and 15, Column A ) may be allocated to the cost centers in Column B (Lines 1 -13). Use the simplest method that produces a reasonably accurate result that is comparable to that obtained by a more complex method. Use the method described below if a more accurate method is not available . It is recommended that allocations of facility and non -clinical support costs to a cost center be done when they are a significant portion of the cost being allocated to the cost center. For instance, the facility and non - clinical support costs of a service delivery site that only provides dental services can be directly associated with Dental, Line 5. The EHR support personnel who support the medical department can be directly allocated to Medical, Line 1. The remaining allocation of indirect costs can be done using a single or multi -step allocation process such as those described below. A simple one -step method is to use the proportion each cost center's direct cost is of total cost (min us facility, non-clinical support, and pharmaceuticals). The resulting percentage is multiplied by the total Facility and Non-Clinical Support Services cost (Line 16) to arrive at the overhead allocation for that cost center. Facility The indirect fa cility cost is commonly allocated based upon the proportion of square feet used by each cost center at each location . Note: The record of square feet used by each cost center at each location should be updated each year. Non- Clinical Support Services Some of the indirect non-clinical support costs may be allocated separately based on known use or other factors. Adjust for d ecentralized front desk personnel , billing and collection systems and personnel , etc. Allocate costs for billing and accounting systems bas ed on use. Allocate various components of non-clinical services based on their use when these amounts are significant and the use is not shared equally. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 134 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 8A Allocate a lesser percentage to large purchased service costs that are known to consume less overhead. Allocate the remaining indirect non-clinical support cost to each cost center based on the proportion each cost center 's direct cost plus previously allocated overhead cost is of the total of those costs. Other Allocation Considerations Lines 1 and 3 both refer to aspects of the medical practice. It is acceptable to report the allocation of all medical facility and non -clinical support services on Line 1 if a more appropriate allocation between Lines 1 and 3 is not available. Pharmaceuticals (Line 8b) does not have an open cell to report an allocation. This is because pharmaceuticals are a purchased service that consumes a significantly lesser facility and non -clinical support charge than services involving personnel. Any allocation of overhead (which is usually minimal) that you choose to make for pharmaceuticals must be reported on Line 8a. There may be sizable contracted or purchased services that use less facility and non -clinical support. A lesser allocation may be appropriate. FAQ S FOR TABLE 8A 1. How do we account for donated services? If a provider comes to your health center and renders a service to your patients, report both the FTE (on Table 5) and the value, which is determined by \"what an individual would reasonably pay\" for the time (not the service), on Table 8A, Line 18. For example, if an optometrist sees five patients in a 2 -hour period, report the amount you would pay an optometrist for 2 hours of work, not the total charges for the five visits. However , if you refer a patient to a provider outside of your health center for a service and the provider donates these services, DO NOT report the activity, the charge, or the value of the time or service on the UDS . This is outside of the health center's scope of project and is considered a donation made by the external provider to the patient. For example, if you refer a patient to a cardiologist who provides free consultation, DO NOT count the visit or the monetary value of the provider's service. 2. How do we account for donated drugs? If drugs are donated directly to the health center, which then dispenses them to a patient, calculate and report on Line 18 the value of the drug at what a reasonable payer would pay for them. This is NOT the retail cost of the drug; it is the 340B price of the drug \u2014an amount that is generally 40 -60 percent of the average wholesale price (AWP). Drugs d onated directly to the patient are not health center donations and are not reported on the UDS . 3. We get most of our vaccines through Vaccines for Children (VFC) or other state and county programs. Are these considered donated drugs and accounted for here? Yes. Report the value of donated drugs that are used in the health center, such as vaccines, on Line 18 in Table 8Aagain, at the reasonable cost based on 340B drug pricing or a discounted price off the AWP . 4. Our doctors were paid the EHR incentive payments directly by CMS. If we let them keep some or all of these dollars, are they reported anywhere on Table 8A? Yes. Establish reporting mechanisms whereby your providers inform you of payments received and account for these funds. If providers are permitted to retain some or all of these funds, report the amount on Line 1. In addition, report the Promoting Interoperability EHR payments received from Medicare or Medicaid on Ta ble 9E, Line 3a. UDS SUPPORT BPHCDATA 135 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 8A 5. What method of overhead (facility and non-clinical support services) allocation should we use for this table? There are multiple ways that facility and non -clinical support services may be allocated to the cost centers in Column B. Use the simplest method that produces a reasonably accurate result that is comparable to that obtained by a more complex method. See the suggested single and multi -step allocation methods for additional information on these methods . 6. Do we need to allocate overhead for contracted services? Contracted services DO NOT warrant a full overhead charge, given that they DO NOT involve the management of personnel. However, the procurement and supervision of those arrangements do consume overhead that should be reported. Contracted services are often charged at a rate that covers the cost of accounting and contract management . 7. Why do our financial statements not tie to the UDS financials? The UDS financials (Tables 8A, 9D, and 9E ) will not tie to your financial statements for the following possible reasons: (1) The UDS is reported on a calendar year basis, January 1 -December 31, but the health center's fiscal year may be a different period. (2) Activity outside the scope of the federal project is included in the health center's financial statements but excluded in the UDS. (3) Net patient service revenue that c ould be estimated from table 9D ( charges less adjustments) may differ from the financial statements because the UDS only reports self -pay bad debt rather than the full adjustment for bad debt attributable to all payers and circumstances. (4) Settlement and wrap revenue is only reported in the UDS upon its receipt , and health centers may be able to recognize some or all of th e revenue on an accrual basis in the period it is earned. (5) Table 9E reports all non-patient service -related revenue on a cash basis, and health centers will recognize this revenue on an accrual basis in their financial statements. 8. What do we need to report in the different columns of this table? The column definitions are detailed on Table 8A. Below is a summary of what to include in each column. Accrued Cost (a) Allocation of Facility and Non - Clinical Support Services (b) Total Cost After Allocation of Facility and Non -Clinical Support Services (c) Costs attributable to the calendar year by cost center .

How are awardee-subrecipient and contractor relationships to be reported? Report the full scope of sub awardee project operations in the UDS Report of the awarded h ealth center that provided a subaward to the other health center (subawardee). If the subawardee is also a Health Center Program awardee, the subawardee will also report the subaward activity on its UDS. Activity associated with contracts for services purchased by one health center and provided by another health center will be reported in the UDS Report of both health centers. The health center providing the services reports the activity of the services provided. The health center purchasing the services reports the activity of the services purchased. 10. How do we report the cost of shared or common space? All facility costs, including for common space, are rep orted on Line 14, Facility, in Column A, Accrued Costs. When allocating the space of a building (in Column B), allocate the shared space used by multiple cost centers, such as hallways, waiting rooms, and equipment rooms, using a method that will distribute that portion of indirect costs to the multiple cost centers that share the space (e.g., distribute with non -clinical support costs to the service category).

Revenue reported on Table 9D generally align s with patient insurance enrollment reported on Table 4. A crosswalk that shows this alignment is available in Appendix B . ROWS: PAYER CATEGORIES AND FORM OF PAYMENT Five major payer categories are listed: Medicaid, Medicare, Other Public, Private, and Self -Pay. Medicaid, Medicare, and Private all have three sub -categories: non-managed care, capitated managed care, and fee-for- service managed care. Only report as managed care if the health center has a contract with an MCO. Form of Payment Non-Managed Care \u2014Fee -for-Service A payment model in which procedures and services are separately charged and paid. Third -party payers pay some or all of the bill, generally based on agreed -upon maximums or discounts. Managed Care\u2014Capitated A pay ment model in which a health center contract s with a n MCO for a list of services covered under c ontract. The MCO pays the health center a capitation fee (a set , usually monthly amount for each patient enrolled with the health center) regardless of whether any services were rendered during the month . No further payment is provided if the services rendered are on a list of services covered by the capitation in the agreement between the health center and the MCO. Note: A supplemental wraparound payment may be made for each visit to adjust total payment to equal federally qualified health center (FQHC ) cost-based rates. Managed Care\u2014Fee -for- Service A payment model in which a health center contract s with an MCO , is assigned patients who must receive their primary care from the health center, and is reimbursed on a fee-for-service (or encounter-rate) basis for covered services.

This will initially reflect the total full charges (per the health center's fee schedule) for services rendered to patients in that payer category during the calendar year. Report charges based on the organizati on's fee schedule for services that are billed to and covered in whole or in part by a payer, or the patient, even if some or all of them are subsequently written off as contractual adjustments, sliding fee discounts, or bad debts. Always report full gross charges according to the health center fee schedule, not a contracted or negotiated rate . Not e: Under no circumstances should the actual amount paid by Medicaid or Medicare (such as FQHC, G code, or T code rates) or the amount paid by any other payer be used as the actual charges. Charges must come from the health center's schedule of fees, typically based on CPT codes, or retail charge (for pharmacy). Report pharmaceuticals dispensed through a (340B) contract pharmacy at the pharmacy's UCR gross charge, even though they are sold at a discount to clinic patients. Include charges for eyeglasses, pharmaceuticals, durable medical equipment, and other similar supply items. Include charges for dispensing or injecting donated pharmaceuticals to the health center or directly to a patient through the health center if they appear on bills and are collected from first and third parties. Report charges for services that are \"carved out\" of managed care capitation contracts (i.e., not included in the listed services under contract) as managed care fee-for-service. DO NOT report : \"contractual adjustments \" as a charge. Instead, report the difference between gross charges and contracted payments from third parties as described in A djustments . charges that are generally not billable to or covered by traditional third-party payers. Some example s include WIC services , parking or job training, and transportation and similar enabling services (not generally included in Column A, except where the payer [ e.g., Medicaid ] accepts billing and pays for these services). Reclassifying Charges Some patients have more than one source of payment for their services. M anagement information system s should automatically reclassify charges rejected by a payer. In these instances, report the charge accepted by the primary payer along with any negotiated adjustment amount for their portion of the services to that payer line . Move the charges for the balance to the secondary payer; after the secondary payer claim settles, move the balance to a tertiary payer (if one exists) and, eventually, to the patient as a self-pay charge. Only report the amount owed by each payer after reclassifying charges to the appropriate payer. If reclassifying cannot be done autom atically, manually remove the amount rejected from the initial payer before reclassifying to the next payer . DO NOT reclassify charges by using an adjustment and rebilling to another payer category ; this will result in an overstatement of total gross charges by reporting the charges twice.

These payments may apply to either a managed care or non -managed care payer. DO NOT report eligible provider payments from CMS for implementing EHRs (commonly referred to as Promoting Interoperability payments). Report these payments on Table 9E , Line 3a . Column C4 : Penalty/Payback Report payments made by the health center to payers because of overpayments collected earlier. Only report amounts paid back during the calendar year . Report \"penalty\" payments made to managed care plans for overutilization of the inpatient or specialty pool funds. If a check was written for the payback, report the payback amount in Column c4, subtract this amount from Column B, and add it to Column D as an adjustment. If the payback amount is deducted from a remittance, report it in Column c4, but DO NOT adjust Columns B or D. DO NOT include as p aybacks anticipated bonuses or payouts that were not earned because P4P goals were not met, regardless of whether they were budgeted. Column D : Adjustments Virtually all insurance companies have a maximum amount they pay for a given service and the health center agrees to write off the difference between what they charge and that contracted amount. These are considere d contractual adjustments. Report in Column D adjustments granted as part of an agreement with a third -party payer. Report a djustments as a positive number, unless as you r educe the initial adjustment by the amount of retroactive settlements and receipts (reported in Columns c1, c2, and c3), current- and prior -year FQHC reconciliations, managed care pool distributions, quality or P4P awards, and other payments the result i s a negative number. Not e: Adjustments that have the normal effect of reducing the charge are reported without brackets or a minus sign in Column D , and those that have the effect of increasing charges are reported as a negative number. Capitated managed care plans only (Lines 2a, 5a, 8a, and 11a only) typically pay on a per -member, per -month basis and make payments in the current month of enrollment, which means these plans DO NOT carry significant receivables. In these instances, r eport the difference between the charges for the capitated services provided and the capitation earned during the calendar year (Column A minus Column B) as the adjustment (Column D), unless there are early or late capitation payments. No adjustments can be entered on Line 13 (self-pay), because patient adjustments are recognized as either sliding fee discounts (Line 13, Column E) or as self -pay bad debt (Line 13, Column F) . If your organization records capitation receipts in the general ledger, this will require that the charges for capitation services be eliminated from the PMS with an adjustment, as no payment is expected to be recorded in the PMS. DO NOT report these in Column D. Only report adjustments in Column D that are the difference between the charges for capitated services and the capitations earned. If the capitations earned were all received during the calendar year, the adjustment will equal the difference between Column A and Column B. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 145 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 9D If not all of the capitations earned were received during the calendar year, Column A less Column B less Column D will equal the capitation amount due to the health center. DO NOT report amounts for which another third party or a patient can be billed (e.g., amounts due from patients or \"Medi gap\" payers for co -payments) as adjustments. Reduce these amounts from the initial charges to the primary payer and record or reclassify them as charges due from the secondary source of payment. Column E : Sliding Fee Discounts Processes detailed in the health center's sliding fee discount policies and procedures determine the discounts , if any, to apply to the portions of charges owed by patients. Only patients may be granted a sliding fee discount based on their ability to pay. Report reductions to patient charges based on the patient's ability to pay using patient's inc ome and family size. Include sliding discounts applied to co -payments and deductibles, as applicable. Report prompt pay discounts provided under a hardship fee waiver program as a sliding fee discount. DO NOT report : automatic discounting of charges for specific categories of patients (e.g., students, patients experiencing homelessness , or agricultural workers). bad debt write -off or forgiveness as a sliding fee discount. other types of discounts that DO NOT meet the criteria as a sliding fee discount. Note: C olumn E is grayed out on all third -party payer lines and only available on the self -pay line . When a sliding fee discount is used to write off part of a charge originally made to a third party, such as Medicare or a private insurance company's co -payment or deductible, first reclassify the charge to self -pay. To reclassify, first reduce the third -party charge by the amount due from the patient and then increase the self-pay charges by th e same amount. Column F : Bad Debt Write -Off Bad debt write-off may occur due to the health center's inability to locate patients, a patient's refusal to pay, a patient's inability to pay when their income is greater than 200 percent of the poverty guideline, or a patient's inability to pay even after the sliding fee discount is granted. Report amounts billed to and defaulted on by any patient. Report bad debts only from patient s. DO NOT report t he bad debt associated with third parties, which may include charges that were not billed within the time permitted by the payer, charges for services rendered to insured patients by providers who were not credentialed by that payer, charges due from payers who are bankrupt, and similar bad debts .

UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 146 2021 UDS MANUAL | Instructions for Table 9D FAQ S FOR TABLE 9D 1. How should charges and collections for patients enrolled in an indigent care program be handled? Report such charges as S elf-Pay, Line 13, in Column A. Report the payments, whether made on a per-visit basis or as a lump sum for services rendered, on Line 6a of Table 9E. See Table 9E Cross-Table Reporting Guidance for Indigent Programs for specific instructions. DO NOT report on this table payments received from state or local indigent care programs subsidizing services rendered to patients who are uninsured. DO NOT report anything as an indigent care program without first reviewing this in a UDS Training Program, with your UDS Reviewer, or with the UDS Support Center. 2. Should the charges less collections less adjustments equal zero? No, normally this is not equal to zero. C harges (Column A) minus collections (Column B) minus adjustment s (Columns D, E, and F) equals the change in accounts receivable or the amount by which what is owed to the health center increases or decreases during the calendar year, except on straight capitat ion plans only (Lines 2a, 5a, 8a, and 11a) . The adjustments for these plans will generally equal the difference between the charges for capitated services and capitations received , unless more is owed to the health center. 3. If we have not received any reconciliation payments for the calendar year, what do we report in Column c1 (current year reconciliations)? Only those cost report settlements and wraparound reconciliations attributable to the report calendar year are reported in Column c1, so nothing would be reported in Column c1. 4. We often use our sliding fee discount program to write off the co -payment portion of the Medicare charge for our certified low-income patients. The sliding fee discount column (Column E) is grayed out for Medicare. How do we record this write-off? Remove the amount of the co-payment from the charge column of the Medicare line (Lines 4 -6, as appropriate) , and then add it to the S elf-Pay line (Line 13). It can then be written off as a sliding fee discount on Line 13. Use the same process for any other co -payment or deductible write -off for patients who received a sliding fee discount . 5. Our system does not automatically reclassify amounts due from other carriers or from the patient. Must we, for example, reclassify Medicare charges that become co -payments or Medicaid charges? Yes. Regardless of whether it is done automatically by your PMS/HIT/EHR or manually, reflect this reclassification of charges that end up being the responsibility of a party other than the initial party. As a rule, your system will make this adjustment in some way, but you may need to work with your vendor to get a report on the amounts transferred. 6. How do we report the charges and collections for pharmaceuticals dispensed at our contract pharmacies? We discuss contract pharmacy reporting at length in Appendix B . In general, report the full charge in Column A by payer. Then, report the amount received from the patient (on Line 13) or insurance company (on Line 10) in Column B. Report the amount that is written off for an insurance company in Column D. Report the amount written off for a patient as a sliding fee discount in Column E.

How should we report the charges associated with \"G -codes\"? G-codes specify a reimbursement rate associated with a package of services that your health center has described to Medicare. (Similar amounts may be paid to you by other third-party payers as well.) For UDS, report these in: Column A: The sum of actual fee schedule/CPT -related charges for visits Column B: What your health center received for payment Column D: The discounted amount disallowed between charges and the amount received Re member to reduce the charges by the Medicare co -payment (20 percent of the allowable charge). The payment from Medicare will be similarly adjusted. See discussion of reclassifying co -payments. Note: If both the actual charge and the G -code charge are routinely used in your system, you must rem ove the G-code charges by running a report to get the total for G -code charges for the year and then subtracting this number from the total charges (actual plus G-code). Report the difference in Column A. Reduce Column D by the G-code amount if it was adjusted using a similar process.

Use the last party rule to report on this table. In this instance, report these funds as state grants, s ince the funds were awarded to the health center by the state for maternal and child health services, even though these may include a mixture of federa l funds (such as Title V) and state funds. 2. We receive various Ryan White- related funds. How do we report these? This depends on which entity you received Ryan White funds from. Use the following to g uide your reporting: Report Ryan White Part A, Impacted Area grants, from county or city governments on Line 7. If they are first sent to a third party, report the funds on Line 8. Report on Line 3 when the reporting entity is a county or city government and the funds were rec eived directly from the Ryan White Part A federal program. Report Part B grants from the state on Line 6, unless they are first sent to a county or city government (in which case, report on Line 7) or to a third party (in which case, report the funds on L ine 8). Report drawdowns received during the calendar year for Ryan White Part C cash receipts on Line 2. Report Part D funds from the HIV/AIDS Bureau on Line 3.

Contracted care is services paid for by the health center. Tables Affected Treatment 5 Report providers (Column A) if the contract is for a portion of an FTE (e.g., one -day-a-week O B/GYN = 0.20 FTE). Always report v isits (Column B or B2) , regardless of method of provider payment or location of service (health center's service delivery site or contract provider's off ice). DO NOT report FTE if the contract is for a service (e.g., $X per visit or $55 per resource -based relative value unit [RBRVU]). 6A Report diagnoses and/or services provided , as applicable , from the encounter form or equivalent from received from the contract provider . 6B, 7 If a contract provider provides any service s that are subject to clinical quality measures, collect and report all data from contractor (e .g., birth weight of a baby from contract obstetrician , last HbA1c from an endocrinologist, sealants placed from a dentist). 8A Column A , Accrued Cost: Report c ost of provider/service on the applicable line. If the provider receives a \"co-payment\" or a \"nominal fee\" from the patient, report the sum of that a nd what the health center pays. Column B , Facility and Non-Clinical Support Services : The h ealth center will generally use a lower facility and non -clinical support services allocation rate for off -site services. Include all facility and non -clinical supp ort costs in the direct charge (Column A ) if the provider is off -site. 9D Column A, Charge : The health center's UCR charge if on -site; use the contractor's UCR charge if off -site. Column B, Collection : The amount received by either the health center or contractor from first or third parties. Column D, Adjustment: The amount disallowed by a third party for the charge (if on Lines 1- 12). Column E, Sliding Fee Discount : The amount written off for eligible patients per the health center's fiscal policies (Line 13), if applicable. Calculate as UCR charge, minus amount collected from patient s, minus amount owed by patient s as their share of payment. DO NOT include payment by the health center here. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 164 2021 UDS MANUAL | Appendix B SERVICES PROVIDED BY A VOLUNTEER PROVIDER Volunteers are not paid by the health center for services, which they provide on-site. This includes v olunteer personnel (including AmeriCorps/HealthCorps, but not NHSC) who provide services on - or off-site on behalf of the health center . FTE can be included in the UDS Report when there is a basis for determining their hours. Tables Affected Treatment 5 Column A , FTE: Report FTE for service s provided by volunteers on-site at the health center's service delivery site . FTE must be calculated . Use hours volunteered as th e numerator. Because volunteers DO NOT receive paid leave benefits, the denominator is the number of hours that comparable personnel spend performing their job. Reduce a full -time schedule of 2,080 hours (for example) by vacation, sick leave, holidays, and continuing education normally provided to personnel . As a rule of thumb, use hours worked divided by a number somewhere around 1, 800. DO NOT report providers who provide services at their own offices. Column B , Clinic Visits , and Column B2, Virtual Visits : Count visits only for service s provided at a service delivery site in the health center's scope of project and under its control. 6A Report diagnoses and/or services provided on -site, as applicable. 8A Column C, Line 18 : Report the value of the time donated by volunteers on this line only. 9D The charges for their services are treated the same as for personnel if the provider is on -site. DO NOT include charges for volunteer providers who are off -site. INTERNS AND RESIDENTS Health centers often use individuals who are in training, referred to variously as interns or residents depending on their field and their licensing. Medical residents are generally licensed practitioners. Some mental health interns, as well as o ther providers , may be licensed practitioners who are training for a higher level of certification or licensing. Tables Affected Treatment 5 Column A : Report licensed interns and residents in the credentialing category they are pursuing . For example, coun t a family practice resident on Line 1 as a Family Physician. Depending on the arrangement, FTEs may be calculated like any other personnel (if they are being paid by the health center) or like a volunteer (if they ar e not being paid). See volunteer providers above . Column s B and B2 : Report visits between a medical resident and a patient as visits to that resident or intern. DO NOT credit the visits to the supervisor of the resident or intern under any circumstance. 8A If the intern or resident is paid by the health center or their cost is being paid through a contract that pays a third party for the interns or residents, report the cost in Column A on the appropriate line (Line 1 for medical, Line 5 for dental, etc.). If the health center is not paying an intern, resident , or third party, report the value of the donated time on Line 18. Be sure to describe the nature of the donation on the table. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA B WOMEN , INFANTS , AND CHILDREN (WIC) Tables Affected Treatment 3A, 3B, 4 DO NOT report individuals whose only encounter with the health center is for WIC services (e.g., nutrition, health education, enabling services) and who receive no other services listed on Table 5 from providers outside of WIC . 5 Report FTE (Column A) on Line 29a. DO NOT report visits and patients (Columns B , B2, and C). 8A Column A , Accrued Cost: Report the total net accrued cost of the program on Line 12 in Column A. Column B , Allocation of Facility and Non-Clinical Support Services : Since much of the non -clinical support services cost of the program will be included in the direct costs, it is presumed that overhead will be at a significantly lower rate. 9D DO NOT report anything associated with the WIC program. 9E Revenue for WIC programs, though originally federal, generally comes to health centers from the state, though some receive it from a lower -level intermediary. If the health center is receiving WIC funds from a state government, the grant/contract funds received go on Line 6. Report funds from an intermediary on Line 8. IN-HOUSE PHARMACY OR DISPENSARY SERVICES FOR HEALTH CENTER PATIENTS Include only that part of the pharmacy that is paid by the health center and dispensed by in-house personnel (see below for other situations) . Tables Affected Treatment 5 Column A , FTE: Report p harmacy personnel on Line 23. If they have only an incidental responsibility to provide assistance in enrolling patients in PAPs, include them on Line 23. Include clinical pharmacists on Line 23 even if they spend time outside of the pharmacy. Report personnel other than pharmacists who spend time with PAP s on Line 27a, Eligibility Assistance. Column s B and B2 , Visits : The UDS does not count encounter s with pharmacy personnel as visits, whether it is for filling prescriptions or associated education or other patient/provider support. This is true for clinical pharmacists with expanded clinical privileges , as well. 8A Line 8a, Column A, Other Pharmacy Direct (Accrued) Costs: Re port a ll other operating costs of the pharmacy on Line 8a. Include salaries, benefits, pharmacy computers, supplies, etc. Line 8b, Column A , Pharmaceutical Direct (Accrued) Costs: Place the actual cost of drugs the pharmacy bought on Line 8b. Include the cost of vaccines, contraceptives , injectable antibiotics, and other drugs dispensed in the health center but not in a pharmacy on Line 8b. The value of donated drugs is not reported here. That amount is reported on Line 18 in Column C . Line 11e, Column A, Eligibility Assistance Direct (Accrued) Costs : Report on Line 11e the cost of personnel (full-time, part -time, or allocated time) helping patients become eligible for PAPs and of all related supplies, equipment depreciation, etc. Column B , Facility and Non -Clinical Support Services : Report all facility and non -clinical support services costs associated with pharmacy and pharmaceuticals (Lines 8a and 8b) on Line 8a. Although there may be some facility and non -clinical support services cost s associated with the actual purchase of the drugs, these costs are generally minimal when compared to the total cost of the drugs. Column C, Line 18: Report the value of donated drugs, including vaccine s (generally calculated at 340 B rates) , on this lin e only. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 166 Appendix B Tables Affected Treatment 9D Column A: Charge is the health center's full retail charge for dispensed drugs. Column B: Collection is the amount received from patients or other third parties/insurance companies. Column D: Adjustment is the amount a third party disallows for the charge (if on Lines 1 -12). Column E: Sliding fee d iscount is the amount written off for eligible patients per health center policies (Line 13). Calculate as retail charge, minus amount collected from patient s (if any ), minus amount owed by patient s (if any ), as their share of payment. 9E DO NOT report the value of donated drugs on this table ; report on Table 8A, Line 18 ( see next page , Donated Drugs, Including Vaccines ). The charges for drugs dispensed to patients go on Table 9D, not on this table. IN-HOUSE PHARMACY FOR COMMUNITY (I.E., FOR NON -PATIENTS ) Many health centers that own licensed pharmacies also provide services to members of the community at large who are not health center patients. Careful records must be maintained at these pharmacies to ensure that non- patients DO NOT receive drugs purchased under section 340B pro visions. Some of these pharmacies are totally in scope, while others have their \"public\" portion out of scope. If the public aspect is out of scope, DO NOT report its activities on the UDS. If it is in scope, treat the public portion as an \"other activity ,\" as follows: Tables Affected Treatment 5 Column A , FTE: Report allocated public portion of personnel on Line 29a: Other Programs and Services. 8A Line 12: Other Program -Related Services: Report all related personnel and pharmacy costs, including cost of pharmaceuticals. 9E Line 10, Other Revenue: Report all revenue from public pharmacy and specify from \"Public access pharmacy.\" CONTRACT PHARMACY DISPENSING TO HEALTH CENTER PATIENTS , GENERALLY USING 340B PURCHASED DRUGS Tables Affected Treatment 5 DO NOT report personnel , visits, or patients for pharmacy dispensing. 8A Report the amount the p harmac y charges for managing dispensing of drugs on Line 8a . Report t he full amount paid for pharmaceuticals , either directly by the clinic or indirectly by the pharmacy , on Line 8b. If the pharmacy buys prepackaged drugs and there is no reasonable way to separate the pharmaceutical costs from the dispensing/administrative costs , report all costs on Line 8b. Ass ociated non -clinical support services (overhead) costs will go on Line 8a in Column B, even though Line 8a Column A is blank. Report payments to pharmacy benefit managers on Line 8a. Share of profits: Some pharmacies engage in fee splitting and keep a share of profit. Report this as a payment to the pharmacy on Line 8a. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, 167 | Appendix B Tables Affected Treatment 9D Column A, Charge : Report t he health center/contract pharmacy's full retail charge for the drugs dispensed . If retail is unknown, ask the pharmacy for retail prices for the drugs dispen sed. Column B, Collection : Report t he amount received from patients or insurance companies. Health centers must collect this information from the contract pharmacy . (Note: Most health centers DO NOT have this sort of arrangement for Medicaid patients, unless explicitly stated.) Column D, Adjustment: Report t he amount disallowed by a third party for the charge (if on Lines 1- 12). Column E, Sliding Fee Discount : Report the amount written off for eligible patients per health center policies (Line 13). Calculate as retail charge (or pharmacy charge), minus amount collected from patient s (by pharmacy or health center), minus amount owed by patient s as their share of payment. 9E DO NOT report pharmacy revenue on Table 9E, and DO NOT use Table 9E to report net revenue from the pharmacy . Report actual gross revenue on Tab le 9D. DONATED DRUGS , INCLUDING VACCINES Tables Affected Treatment 8A If the drugs are donated to the health center and then dispensed to patients, report their value (generally calculated at 340 B rates) on Line 18, Column C. If the drugs are donated directly to the patient, the health center is not required to report the value of the drugs; however, it is preferred that the value be included for a better understanding of the program. 9D If the health center charges patients a dispensing fee, report only this amount and its collection and/or write - off. 9E DO NOT report any amount, even though generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) might suggest another treatment for the value. CLINICAL DISPENSING OF DRUGS Clinic areas of health centers dispense m any pharmaceuticals, including vaccines , allergy shots , contraceptives, and drugs used in MAT of opiate use . This may be a service associated with the visit or, in the case of vaccinations, a community service. These services DO NOT count as a visit, but charging patients for them is appropriate unl ess the clinic received the drugs for free. Tables Affected Treatment 3A, 3B, 4 DO NOT report these individuals as patients if this is the only service they received during the year. 5 DO NOT report these services as visits. 6A DO NOT report these on Table 6A; they are not visits. 8A Report drug costs on Line 8b , Pharmaceuticals (not on Line 3, Other Medical Costs). In the case of vaccines obtained at no cost through Vaccines for Children or other state or local programs, report the value on Line 18, Donated Services and Supplies. 9D Report full charges, collections, adjustments , and discounts, as appropriate. Note t hat it is not appropriate to charge for a pharmaceutical that has been donated . However, an administration and/or dispensing fee is appropriate. Note that Medicare has separate flu vaccine rules. 9E DO NOT report any amount. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ | Appendix B ADHC AND PACE Medicare, Medicaid, and certain other third -party pay ers often recognize ADHC programs. They involve caring for an infirm, frail, or elderly patie nt during the day to permit family members to work and to avoid institutionalization and preserve the health of the patient. They are quite expensive and may involve extraordinary per member per month ( PMPM ) capitation payments , but are cost effective comp ared to institutionalization. Patients who have both Medicare and Medicaid coverage are treated as Medi-Medi , as described below. PACE is even more expansive and may include ADHC services, as well as services to maintain independence for the elderly. Table s Affected Treatment 3A, 3B, 4 Report the individuals seen during the year in ADHC and PACE programs as patients if the encounter is a countable visit. 5 When a provider does a formal, separately billable examination of a patient at the ADHC/PACE facility, treat it as any other medical visit. DO NOT count the nursing, observation, monitoring, and dispensing of medication services that are bundled together to form an ADHC service as a visit for the purposes of reporting. Personnel are included on Line 29a, Other Programs and Services. 6A, 6B, 7 Report the clinical activity provided to patients at ADHC and PACE facilities, as appropriate, on the clinical tables. 8A If the health center provides and bills medical services separately from the ADHC charge, report the associated costs on Lines 1 -3. Report all other costs on Line 12. Similarly, include PACE costs for medical on Lines 1 -3, pharmacy costs on Lines 8a-8b, and all other costs on Line 12. 9D Report ADHC charges and collections on this table, generally as Medicaid and/or Medicare. Because of FQHC procedures, it is possible that there will also be significant positive or negative adjustments . In additi on, see Medi -Medi , below. MEDI-MEDI/DUALLY ELIGIBLE Some individuals are eligible for and enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid (commonly referred to as Medi - Medi or d ually eligible ). In this case, Medicare is primary and billed first. After Medicare pays its (usually FQHC -associated Z code or geographic -rate-adjusted ) fee, the remainder is billed to Medicaid , which pays an amount based on policy that varies from state to s tate. Tables Affected Treatment 4 Report p atients on Line 9, Medicare. DO NOT report as Medicaid. In addition, report these patients on Line 9a, Dually Eligible (Medicare and Medicaid); this line is a subset of the total reported on Line 9, Medicare. 9D While the entire charge initially shows as a Medicare charge, after Medicare m akes its payment the remaining allowable amount is reclassified to Medicaid. Report t he payment received from Medicaid on Line 1 in Column B. Report the difference between the charge and the collection as a positive or negative adjustment , depending on the amount. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET | Appendix B CERTAIN GRANT -SUPPORTED CLINICAL CARE PROGRAMS : BCCCP, TITLE X, ETC. Some programs pay providers on a fee -for-service or fee-per -visit basis under a contract, which may or may not also have a cap on total payments per grant period ( usually the state fiscal year). They cover a very narrow range of services. Breast and c ervical c ancer control and family p lanning programs are the most common, but there are others. These are fee -for service or fee-per -visit programs only. Tables Affected Treatment 4 These programs are not insurance. They pay for a service, but health centers must classify patient s according to their primary health insurance carrier. Most of these programs DO NOT serve insured patients, so most of the patients would be reported on Li ne 7 as uninsured. 9D Although the patient is likely uninsured, th ere is an \"other public\" payer for the service. Report the health center 's usual and customary charge for the service ( not the negotiated fee paid by the public entity) on Line 7 in Column A and the payment in Column B. Because the payment will almost always be different from the charge, report the difference as an adjustment in Column D. 9E DO NOT report the grant or contract covering the fee -for-service or fee -per-visit amount on Table 9E. Fully account for this on Table 9D. STATE OR LOCAL INDIGENT CARE PROGRAMS These pay through a grant for a wide range of clinical services for uninsured patients, generally those under an income limit. Most of these programs set payment cap s and often make payments in a different fiscal year than that in which the patient received the service. Tables Affected Treatment 4 While patients may need to meet eligibility criteria , these programs are not public insurance. Count patients receiving care through these programs on Line 7 as uninsured , unless they have insurance. 9D The health center's usual charges for each service are charged directly to patient s (reported on Line 13, Column A). If patient s pay any co -payment, report it in Column B. If they are responsible for a co -payment but DO NOT pay it, it remains a receivable until it is collected or is written off as bad debt in Column F. Report the rest of the charge (or all the charge if there is no required co- payment) as a sliding fee discount in Column E. 9E Report the total amount received during the calendar year from the state or local indigent care program on Line 6a. WORKERS ' COMPENSATION Worker s' compensation is a form of liability insurance for employers and not health insurance for employees. Tables Affected Treatment 4 If workers' compensation covers a patient's bills, the patient usually has related insurance. Report that on Table 4 (even if the health center is not billing the insurance). Patients with work -related insurance go on Line 11 (Private). Those without any health insurance go on Line 7 (Uninsured). 9D Report charges, collections, and adjustments for workers' compensation -covered services on Line 10 (Private Non-Managed SUPPORT , 866-UDS -HELP, , TRIGON , PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ' INSURANCE , ETC. Many government employees have insurance. Tables Affected Treatment 4 Report them on Line 11 (Private), not on Line 10a. Note: Coverage directly through the Department of Veterans Affairs is a form of \"o ther public \" payment, not a form of medical insurance. Identify if the patient has primary medical insurance. 9D Report charges, collections, and adjustments on Lines 10 -12 (Priva te), not on Lines 7 -9. CONTRACT SITES Some health centers have included in their scope of project a service delivery site (such as a school, workplace, or jail) where they provide services to patients at a contracted flat rate per session or other similar rate that is not based on the volume of work performed . The agreement generally stipulates whether and under what circumstances the health center may bill third parties. Tables Affected Treatment 4 Lines 1 -6, Income: Obtain information on income from patients. In prisons, assume that all are at 100 percent and below FPG (Line 1). In schools, income should be that of the parent (s) or \"unknown. \" In the case of minor consent services, patients should be reported as below poverty. In the workplace, income is the patient's family income or, if not known, \"unknown\" (Line 5). Lines 7 -12, Insurance: Record the form of medical insurance the patient has, regardless of the health center 's ability to bill that source. (Medicaid often covers children in school -based clinics even though they have another provider. Report these children as Medicaid patients. ) The health center 's contracting agency is not an insurer. Except for confidential minor consent services, it is not acceptable to report a student as uninsured . 5 Report all visits as appropriate. DO NOT reduce or reclassify FTEs for travel time. 8A Costs will generally be considered medical (Lines 1 -3) unless other services (mental health, case management, etc.) are being provided. DO NOT report on Line 12: Other Related Services . 9D Unless the health center charges a visit to a third party such as Medicaid , report the health center 's usual and customary charges on Line 10, Column A (Private). Report the amount paid by the contractor in Column B. Report the difference (positive or negative) in Column D ( Adjustments ). 9E DO NOT report contract rev enue SUPPORT 171 2021 UDS MANUAL | Appendix B THE CHILDREN 'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (CHIP) CHIP provides health coverage to eligible children through Medicaid and separate CHIP programs. CHIP is administered by states, according to federal requirements. The program is funded jointly by states and the federal government. Tables Affected Treatmen t 4 Medicaid : If Medicaid handles CHIP and the enrolled patients are identifiable, report them on Line 8b. If it is not possible to differentiate CHIP administered through Medicaid from Medicaid , report the enrolled patients on Line 8a with all other Medicaid patients. Non-Medicaid : Report CHIP -enrolled patients in states that DO NOT use Medicaid as \"Other Public CHIP\" on Line 10b. DO NOT report the enrollees on Line 11 (Private) even if a private insurance plan administers the program . 9D Medicaid : Report on Lines 1 -3, as appropriate. Non-Medicaid : Report on Lines 7- 9 (Other Public ), as appropriate. D O NOT report on Lines 10- 12 (Private ), even if a private insurance company administers the plan . CARVE-OUTS Relevant to capitated managed care only: T he health center has a capitated contract with an HMO that stipulates that one set of CPT codes will be covered by the capitation, regardless of service frequency, and another set of codes (or all other codes) will be paid for by the HMO on a fee-for-servi ce basis (the carve-outs) when appropriate. Most common carve -outs involve mental health, lab, radiology, and pharmacy, but may include specific specialty care or diagnoses (e.g., perinatal care or HIV). Tables Affected Treatment 4 Patient Member Months: Member months are reported on Line 13a in the appropriate column, regardless of whether the patient made use of services in any or all of those months. Make no entry on Line 13b (fee -for- service managed care member months) for the carved -out services, rega rdless of payments received . : Report c apitation payments on the \"a\" lines and carve -out payments on the \"b\" lines. Report wraparound payments on both lines using the health center's allocation process. INCARCERATED PATIENTS Some health centers contract with jails or prisons to provide health services to inmates. These arrangements can vary in terms of the contractual arrangement and location for providing health services to patients. Tables Affected Treatment 4 Assume prisoner income is at or below 100 percent FPL (Line 1). Unless the institution has arranged for inmate Medicaid enrollment, assume that inmates are uninsured. 9D The jail or prison pays for the patient's services. Report the health center's usual an d customary charge for the service in Column A and the payment in Column B. Because the payment will almost always be different from the charge, report the difference as an adjustment in Column D, as follows: Line 9 (Other Public) if a government entity Line 10 (Private) if privately run 9E DO NOT report the grant or contract on Table 9E .

UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 173 2021 UDS MANUAL | Appendix B ISSUANCE OF VOUCHERS FOR PAYMENT OF SERVICES Voucher programs have traditionally delivered primary and specialty care services to agricultural workers in geographically dispersed areas. Some homeless and other health center programs also use vouchers to outsource care they cannot provide in-house. This involves contracting with providers outside of the health center. Vouchers authorize a third -party provider to deliver the services, and the voucher goes to the health center for payment. Payment is generally less than the provider's full fee but consistent with other payers, such as Medicaid. Tables Affected Treatment ZIP Code , 3A, 3B, 4 Report patients even if the only service they receive is a paid vouchered servi ce if these services would make the patient eligible for inclusion if the health center provided them. A vouchered taxi ride or prescription would not make the individual \"countable\" because health centers DO NOT count transportation or pharmacy services on Table 5, but a vouchered eye exam would count. 5 Column A: There is no way to account for the time of the voucher providers. As a result, report 0 FTEs for these services. If there is a provider who works at the health center, count the FTE of that provider. For example, count the one -day-a-week family practitioner as 0.20 FTEs on Line 1. Column s B and B2 : Report all visits covered by voucher. D O NOT report visits where the referral is to a provider who is not paid in full for the service (e. g., a \"voucher\" to a doctor who donates five visits per week or one that pays a portion of the provider's fee with the rest being the patient's responsibility does not generate a visit on Table 5). 6A, 6B, 7 Diagnoses and Services: The voucher program should receive a bill from the provider , similar to a Health Care Financing Administration ( HCFA )-1500 , that lists the services and diagnoses. Health centers should track these and report them on Table s 6A, 6B, and 7. 8A Cost of Vouchered Services: Report t he costs on the appropriate service line (s). Report medical vouchers on Line 1, not Line 3. Repor t only those costs paid directly by the health center. Discounts: Virtually all clinical providers receive less than their full fee. Some health centers report the amount of these discounts as \"donated services.\" While this is not required , health centers may report the difference between the voucher provider's full fee and the contracted voucher payment as a donated service on Line 18, Column C. 9D Column A , Charges : Report the full charge that provider s show on their HCFA -1500 on Line 13 (Self-Pay). DO NOT use the voucher amount as the full charge. Column B , Collections : If the patient paid the voucher program or the voucher provider a nominal or other fee, report this in Column B. Column E , Sliding Fee Discounts : Report the difference between the full charge and the amount that the patient was supposed to pay in Column E. D O NOT report the full amount in Column E if the patient should have paid the health center or voucher provider but did not complete payment . Column F , Bad Debt : Report any amount (such as a nominal fee) that the patient was supposed to pay to the health center but did not. Report bad debts according to the health center's financial policies. D O NOT report amounts that were due but not paid to the referral provider.

While this is permitted , as is a reduced denom inator containing a minimum of 80 percent of all medical (or dental for the sealants measure) patients from all service delivery sites and grant -funded programs in the defined denominator , full EHR or HIT system reporting is preferred . Note: D ata source must cover the review period (e.g., 5 years for Pap tests, 2 years for immunizations) and include information to assess meeting the numerator criteria with the clinical quality measure, as well as to evaluate exclusions. If you can meet all conditions, reporting on the denominator \u2014even a reduced denominator \u2014generally provides access to pre- programmed tools, which can facilitate reporting. You may only use a reduced denominator if the factors that required its use are unrelated to the measure variables (see reporting requirements for Tables 6B and 7). This is not a sample , and the methods discussed here are not relevant to these situations. If the health center cannot report on at least 80 percent of the denominator (or chooses not to use its HIT/E HR), it must use a random sample to report CQMs in the UDS . RANDOM SAMPLE A random sample is a part of the denominator where each member of the denominator has the exact same chance of inclusion as every other member. A true random sample generates outcomes similar to those of the denominator of patients because the sample is representative. STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS FOR REPORTING CLINICAL QUALITY MEASURES USING A RANDOM SAMPLE Perform the following steps for each sample. Create a new random sample for each measure. Step 1: Identify the Patient Population (the Denominator ) Define the denominator for the measure. The denominator must include : all active (measurement period) medical patients, all service delivery sites in the scope of the project , all funding streams, and any and all contracted medical services. Identify the number of patients who fit, or who initially appear to fit, the criteria for that measure. Because you will review each patient health record in the sample, you can remove any that was mistakenly included. Create a list and number each member of the patient population in the denominator . The list may be in any sequence because randomization will remove any order bias. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA .NET 178 2021 UDS MANUAL | Appendix C Step 2: Prepare a Random Sample to the Correct Sample Size BPHC mandates a sample size of 70. Using one of two recommended sampling methodologies (see below) , identify the sample of 70 patient health records. Step 3 : Review the S ample of Patient Health R ecords to Determine Whether Each Record H as Met the Numerator Criteria for the Clinical Quality Measure For each clinical quality measure, review available data sources to identify any automated sources to simplify data collection. Because health centers augment the automated data fields (if any) for these sources with text and scanned documents, they DO NOT need to be available for all patients. Examples of data sources include: EHRs disease- specific (PC -DM IS, PECs, i2i-track, etc.) databases state immunization registries for vaccine histories logs PMS For each patient in the sample, determine whether sufficient information is available in these alternative resources to meet the standard. If you cannot meet the standard using the alternative source, review text and scanned information to retrieve required information. For example, consider a patient's health record that shows that the y are an active medical patient but do es not show the CPT or ICD -10-CM code for a Pap test . Review scanned documents to see if there is a copy of a Pap test done by another agency in the patient's health record. Step 4 : Replace Patients You Exclude from th e Sample Best practices would dictate that the methodology used to select the sample (or the denominator ) should be able to test for each required criteri on. Some criteria (such as the age of the patient) are easily implemented. Others, such as whether a woman has ever had a hysterectomy, may not be available. When you cannot use criteria to include patients in the denominator , you may use them to exclude patients from a sample. If you determine that a patient health record does not meet the standard criteria, remove the patient health record. If the review is of a sample of patient health records, then select another record to replace the original. Replace an excluded patient health record with a substitute. Use the replacement methodology described for the sample selected. Any criteria that was missed in selecting a patient health record (e.g., not noting that the woman had a hysterectomy) may be used to exclude a record. METHODOLOGY FOR OBTAINING A RANDOM SAMPLE You may use either of the two approved methods for generating a random sample and a sample of replacements for excluded patients: Work with a list of random numbers generated for your total patient population. Select a random starting point and use a calculated interval to find each next member of the sample. Use either method to create a \"replacement list\" to replace patient health records that were excluded during the review process. UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA Appendix C Option #1: Random Number List The preferred method for selecting a random sample is to use a random number list. You can create an individualized list of random numbers at the Research R andomizer website . The website requires no password or subscription. To obtain a list of random numbers, complete the questions documented below. Identifying an Initial List 1. Request one list of 70 numbers. 2. Complete the \"Number Range\" by entering 1 as the first number and the total number of patients in the denominator for the particular measure under consideration as \"n.\" For example, if there are 628 children who turn 2 years old in the calendar year in the denominator , enter 628 as \" n.\" 3. Click on the button, \"Randomize Now!\" The site will produce a list of randomly generated numbers. These numbers correspond with the numbered list of patient s in the denominator prepared in Step 1 above. It is helpful to ask the web site to sort the selected random numbers from lowest to highest. Identifying a Replacement To create a sample of patient health records to substitute for excluded records, follow the instructions for creating a list of random numbers for a replacement sample. Rather than selecting 70 numbers for the set, select a smaller sample of 5 to 10 patient health records. In this instance, DO NOT sort the list because doing so will bias the replacement sample toward the lower numbers on the list. If, upon review, you must exclude a patient health record from the original random sample of 70, replace it with one from the replacement sample. Because of the need to replace ineligible patient health records, you may have to exclude more than 70 records to meet the standard for a particular measure, but the final sample will include 70 records that meet all the selection criteria. Alternatively, for example, you can draw a sample of 80 patients and use the first 70. If you must replace one, use the 71st, then the 72nd, and so on. In this instance, DO NOT request a sorted list because it will have a bias toward lower numbers. Input Initial Sample Replacements Set of numbers 1 1 Number per set 70 At least 5 or more if needed Number range = 1 -n Last number in sequence Last sequence number in list Unique numbers Yes Yes Sort numbers Yes, least to greatest No UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, UDSHELP 330@ BPHCDATA | Appendix C Option #2: Interval Identifying an Initial List Sample interval (SI) s ize equals p opulation s ize (number in denominator ) divided by sample size (70) . The second method uses the same numbered list of records in the denominator created in Step 1 (Identify the Patient Population [the Denominator ]). To generate the sample: 1. Calculate the SI by dividing the number of patient health records in the denominator by 70. 2. Randomly pick a patient health record from the first SI. For example, if the SI is 10, the first SI includes patient health records number 1 through number 10. Randomly select one patient health record from this interval to use as your first record. 3. Then, select every nth patient health record where n is the SI until you reach the desired sample size. In our example, if the first patient selected is number 8, and the SI is 10, then the remaining patients to be selected are numbers 18, 28, 38, and so on . First sequence number plus SI equals second number. 4. Continue through the list until you have identified all 70. Example <blank> Sample interval (SI) = 3 Patient Health Record # Account # <blank> 1 951456 First patient health record = #2 Selected at random between 1 and 3 2 234951 <blank> 3 492374 <blank> 4 157614 453764 <blank> 7 416145 481454 <blank> 10 487151 625182 <blank> 13 789415 = #14 (11+3) 15 745405 <blank> Identifying a Replacement If a selected patient health record needs to be excluded from the sample, return to the original list and substitute the next record on the list after the excluded record. If the replacement patient health record must be excluded, select the record after that on the list until an eligible record is selected. Resume selection using the next patient health record you had pre -selected for the sample. If you run out of patient health records on the list, continue your count back at the beginning of the denominator . In this manner, more than 70 patient health records may be evaluated for meeting the standard for a particular measure, but 70 records that meet all the selection criteria should be included in the final sample.

The HIT Form must be completed and submitted as part of the UDS submission. The form includes questions about the health center's implementation of an EHR, certification of systems, and how widely adopted the system is throughout the health center and its providers. There are no major changes to this form . QUESTIONS The following questions appear in the E HBs. Complete them before you file the UDS Report. Reporting requirements for the HIT questions are on-screen in the EHB s as you complet e the form. Respond to each question based on your health center status as of December 31 . 1. Does your h ealth center currently have an e lectronic health record (EHR) system installed and in use, at minimum for medical care, by December 31 ? a. Yes, installed at all service delivery sites and used by all providers For the purposes of this response, \"providers\" mean all medical providers, including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and certified nurse midwives. Although some or all of the dental, mental health, or other provider s may also be using the system, as may medical support personnel, this is not required to choose response (a). For the purposes of this response, \"all service delivery sites\" means all permanent service delivery sites where medical providers serve health center medical patients. It does not include administrative -only locations, hospitals or nursing homes, mobile vans, or sites used on a seasonal or temporary basis. You may check this option if a few newly hired, untrained personnel are the only ones not using the system. b. Yes, but only installed at some service delivery sites or used by some providers Select option ( b) if one or more permanent service delivery sites did not have the EHR installed or in use (even if this is planned), or if one or more medical providers (as defined on this page under [a]) do not yet use the system. When determining if all providers have access to the system, the health center should also consider part -time and locum providers who serve clinic patients. Do not select this option if the only medical providers who did not have access were those who were newly hired and still being trained on the system. c. No Select \"no\" if no EHR was in use on December 31, even if you had the system installed and training had started. If the health center purchased an EHR but has not yet put it into use, answer \"no.\" UDS SUPPORT CENTER , 866-UDS -HELP, 182 2021 UDS MANUAL | Appendix D This question seeks to determine whether the health center installed an EHR by December 31 and, if so, which product was in use, how broad system access was, and what features were available and in use.
