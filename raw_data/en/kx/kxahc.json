Acknowledgements Financial support 1 Vitamin A supplementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age WHO | Guideline Vitamin A deficiency affects about 19 million pregnant women and 190 million preschool -age children, mostly from the World Heal th Organization (WHO) regions of Africa and South -East Asia. Infants and children have increased vitamin A requirements to support rapid growth and to help them combat infections. Member Stat es have requested guidance from WHO on the effects and safety of vitamin A supplementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age as a public health strategy in support of their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. WHO has developed the present e vidence -informed recommendation using the procedures outlined in the WHO handbook for guideline development . The steps in this process included: (i) identification of priority questions and outcomes; (ii) retrieval of the evidence; (iii) assessment and synthesis of the evidence; (iv) formulation of recommen dations, including future research priorities; and (v) planning for dissemination, implementation, impact evaluation and updating of the guideline. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE ) methodology was followed to pr epare evidence profiles related to preselected topics, based on up-to -date systematic reviews. An international, multidisciplinary group of experts participated in two WHO technical consultations, held in Geneva, Switzerland, on 19- 20 October 2009 and 16 -18 March 2011, to review and discuss the evidence and draft recommendation, and to vote on the strength of the recommendation, taking into consideration: (i) desirable and undesirable effects of this intervention; (ii) the quality of the available evidence; (iii) values and preferences related to the intervention in different settings; and (iv) the cost of options available to health -care workers in different settings. All guideline group members completed a Declaration of Interest s Form before each meeting. An External Experts and Stakeholders Panel was involved throughout the process. In settings where vitamin A deficiency is a public health problem, vitamin A supplementation is recommended in infants and children 6 -59 months of age as a public health int ervention to reduce child morbidity and mortality (strong recommendation). The quality of the available evidence for all-cause mortality was high, whereas for all other critical outcomes it was moderate to very low. The quality of the available evidence fo r outcomes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - positive children was moderate for all-cause mortality. Summary Vitamin A supplementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age 1 This publication is a WHO guideline. A WHO guideline is any document, whatever its title, containing WHO recommendations about health interventions, whether they be clinical, public health or policy interventions. A recommendation provides information about what policy -makers, health -care providers or patients should do. It implies a choice between different interventions that have an impact on health and that have ramifications for the use of resources. All publications containing WHO recommendations are approved by the WHO Guidelines Review Committee. WHO Guideline1 2 Vitamin A supplementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age WHO | Guideline This guideline provides global, evidence-informed recommendations on the use of vitamin A supplements in infants and children 6 -59 months of age for the reduction of morbidity and mortality. The guideline will help Member Sta tes and their partners in their efforts to make informed decisions on the appropriate nutrition actions to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, in particular, reduction in child mortality (MDG 4). The guideline is intended for a wide audience includin g policy -makers, their expert advisers, and technical and programme staff in organizations involved in the design, implementation and scaling -up of nutrition actions for public health. This document presents the key recommendation and a summary of the supp orting evidence. Further details of the evidence base are provided in Annex 1 and other documents listed in the references. Vitamin A deficiency is a major public health problem affecting an estimated 190 million preschool -age children, mostly from the Wo rld Health Organization (WHO) regions of Africa and South -East Asia ( 1). Infants and children have increased vitamin A requirements to promote rapid growth and to help combat infections. Inadequate intakes of vitamin A at this age could lead to vitamin A deficiency, which, when severe, may cause visual impairment (night blindness) or increase the risk of illness and mortality from childhood infections such as measles and those causing diarrhoea (2 ). The combination of childhood underweight, micronutrient de ficiencies (iron, vitamin A and zinc) and suboptimal breastfeeding is responsible for 7% of deaths and 10% of the total disease burden ( 3). Vitamin A deficiency alone is responsible for almost 6% of child deaths under the age of 5 years in Africa and 8% in South -East Asia (3). Vitamin A supplementation in children 6 -59 months of age living in developing countries is associated with a reduced risk of all -cause mortality and a reduced incidence of diarrhoea (4 ). The mechanisms by which vitamin A reduces morta lity are not fully understood, and it is not clear whether its action is mediated through the correction of underlying deficiencies or through adjuvant therapeutic effects. Vitamin A supplementation may improve gut integrity and therefore decrease the seve rity of some diarrhoeal episodes ( 5). The role of vitamin A in innate and adaptive immunity may also include reducing susceptibility to and/or severity of other infections ( 6, 7). Many countries have integrated strategies to deliver vitamin A supplements t o infants and children in their national health policies ( 8, 9). The delivery of vitamin A has been integrated into routine health services, for example through the establishment of biannual \"special days\", when vitamin A supplementation is combined with o ther child survival interventions such as deworming or nutrition education. Vitamin A supplements are also commonly distributed as part of the Expanded Program me on Immunization (especially at 9 months, alongside measles vaccination). In 2009, about 77% of preschool children in more than 103 priority countries received two doses of vitamin A supplements ( 10). Scope and purpose Background 3 Vitamin A supplementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age WHO | Guideline Provision of high doses of vitamin A every 6 months until the age of 5 years was based on the principle that a single, large dose of vitamin A is well absorbed and stored in the liver, and then mobilized, as needed, over an extended period of time (11). A dose of 100 000 International Units (IU) in infants 6 -11 months of age and 200 000 IU in children 12 -59 months of age is considered to provide adequat e protection for 4- 6 months, with the exact interval depending on the vitamin A content of the diet and the rate of utilization by the body ( 8, 12). In most children 6 -59 months of age, a dose of 100 000- 200 000 IU of vitamin A is well tolerated, although side -effects such as headache, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhoea have been reported in 3- 7% of these children ( 13). However, these symptoms are transient, with the large majority starting and disappearing within 24 hours of dosing. There are no known death s attributed solely to vitamin A toxicity due to overconsumption of vitamin A ( 13). On a per -child basis, vitamin A supplementation is considered a low- cost intervention. Most of the vitamin A used during supplementation campaigns is supplied in gelatin c apsules which cost approximately US$ 0.02 each ( 14), with an estimated cost of US$ 1 -2 for delivery per child per year ( 15). The total cost of supplementation per death averted is estimated at US$ 200 -250 ( 16, 17). Two existing Cochrane systematic reviews assessing the effects and safety of vitamin A supplementation in children 6 -59 months of age were updated for this guideline (4, 18 ). One review evaluated the effectiveness of vitamin A supplements in the prevention of morbidity and mortality in children 6- 59 months of age ( 4). It showed that giving vitamin A supplements to children reduces the rates of mortality and some diseases. A meta -analysis of 17 trials (11 in Asia, 5 in Africa and 1 in Latin America) for all-cause mortality indicated that vitamin A reduces the overall risk of death by 24% (risk ratio (RR) 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 -0.83). When an unpublished cluster -randomized trial involving one million children in north India (the DEVTA trial) was considered, vitamin A supplementation reduced the effect size of all -cause mortality from 24% to 12% (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.84- 0.94). Due to limited availability of information on the DEVTA trial the quality of this trial could not be assessed. Seven trials indicated that vitamin A supplementatio n significantly reduces diarrhoea -related mortality (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.57- 0.91) trials: 0.80; RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.54 -1.14) was not reduced. T he o ccurrence of new episodes of diarrhoea decreased (13 trials: RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.82 -0.87). There was no significant effect on the incidence of respiratory disease ( nine trials: RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.95 -1.37), or hospitalizations due to diarrhoea or pneumonia. There was a significantly increased risk of vomiting within the first 48 hours of supplementation with 100 000- 200 000 IU of vitamin A (three trials: RR 2.75; 95% CI 1.81-4.19). Only one study reported data on bulging fontanelles as most studies Summary of evidence 4 Vitamin A supplementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age WHO | Guideline included children over 1 year of age and thus would not have assessed this side- effect. There was no significant effect of vitamin A supplementation when the data were stratified by national child mortality rates (data from countries with low versus high child mortali ty rates) (4 ). It was not possible to perform subgroup analyses for dose and frequency of supplementation as the analyses were underpowered and any effects would have been attributed to chance. The second review assessed whether micronutrient supplements, including vitamin A, are safe and effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in adults and children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection ( 18). It included five trials on vitamin A supplementation in children with a total of 1120 participant s; only three trials (262 participants, all in Africa) contributed data on all -cause mortality. The data suggest that vitamin A reduces the overall risk of death (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.37- 0.82). The overall quality of the evidence for all-cause mortality was high, whereas it was moderate to very low for the remaining critical outcomes (Annex 1). The quality of the available evidence for outcomes in HIV-positive children was moderate for all- cause mortality. The effect of vitamin A supplementation on antibody r esponse to measles vaccination has recently been evaluated in an additional review ( 19). A meta -analysis of seven trials indicated that vitamin A supplementation at 6 or 9 months of age did not affect the measles vaccine response (seroconversion rates). No study has prospectively assessed the impact of co -administration of vitamin A and measles vaccine on child mortality. High -dose vitamin A supplementation is recomm ended in infants and children 6 -59 months of age i n settings where vitamin A deficiency is a public health problem1 (strong recommendatio n2). Recommendation A suggested vitamin A supplementation scheme for infants and children 6- 59 months of age is presented in Table 1. 1 Determination of vitamin A deficiency as a public health problem involves estimating the prevalence of deficiency in a population by using specific biochemical and clinical indicators of vitamin A status. Classification of countries based on the most recent estimates is available in reference (1 ). 2 A strong recommendation is one for which the guideline development group is confident that the desirable effects of adherence outweigh the undesirable effects. The recommendation can be either in favour of or against an intervention. Implications of a strong recommendation for patients are that most people in their situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not. Implications for clinicians are that most patients should receive the recommended course of action, and that adherence to this recommendation is a reasonable measure of good -quality care. With regard to policy -makers, a strong recommendation means that it can be adapted as a policy in most situations. 5 Vitamin A supplementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age WHO | Guideline Target group Infants 6 -11 months of age (including HIV+) Children 12 -59 months of age (including HIV+) Dose 100 000 IU (30 mg RE) vitamin A 200 000 IU (60 mg RE) vitamin A Frequency Once Every 4 -6 months Route of administration Oral liquid, oil -based preparation of retinyl palmitate or retinyl acetatea Settings IU, international units; RE, retinol equivalent. a An oil -based vitamin A solution can be delivered using soft gelatin capsules, as a single -dose dispenser or a graduated spoon ( 20). Consensus among manufacturers to use consistent colour coding for the different doses in soft gelatin capsules, namely red for the 200 000 IU capsules and blue for the 100 000 IU capsules, has led to much - improved training and operational efficiencies in the field. This guideline replaces previous recommendations on vitamin A supplementation for the prevention of vitamin A deficiency, xerophthalmia and nutritional blindness in infants and children 6 -59 months of age ( 8). The above recommendatio n can also be applied in populations where infants and children may be infected with HIV. The magnitude of the effect may differ across settings and populations, possibly due to the extent of vitamin A deficiency or the availability of other nutrients (e .g. dietary intake of vitamin A will differ across locations and the effects of supplementation may be smaller in places with greater access to vitamin A -rich foods or with regular consumption of vitamin A-fortified foods). This intervention should be use d along with other strategies to improve vitamin A intakes, such as dietary diversification ( 21) and food fortification ( 22). Remarks Table 1 Populations where the prevalence of night blindness is 1% or higher in children 24 -59 months of age or where the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency (serum retinol 0.70 \u00b5mol /l or lower) is 20% or higher in infants and children 6 -59 months of age Suggested vitamin A supplementa tion scheme for infants children 6 -59 months of age 6 Vitamin A supplementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age WHO | Guideline Dissemination, adaptation and implementation Dissemination The current guideline will be disseminated through electronic media such as slide presentations, CD -ROMs and the World Wide Web, either through the WHO Micronutrients and United Nations Standing Committee on Nutrition ( SCN ) mailing lists or the WHO nutrition web site . Currently, the WHO Department of Nutrition for Health and Development is developing the WHO electronic Library of Evidence for Nutrition Actions (eLENA). This library aims to compile and display WHO guidelines related to nutrition along with complementary documents such as systematic reviews and other evidence informing the guidelines, biological and behavioural rationales, and additional resources produced by Mem ber States and global partners. Adaptation and implementation As this is a global guideline, it should be adapted to the context of each Member State. Prior to implementation, a vitamin A supplementation programme should include well- defined objectives that take into account available resources, existing Adverse effects within 48 hours of receiving supplements containing 100 000- 200 000 IU vitamin A are usually mild and transient, with no long - term consequences. Adverse effects may include bulging of open fontanelles in younger infants, and nausea and/or vomiting and headache in older children with closed fontanelles. Vitamin A supplements should be delivered to children 6 -59 mont hs of age twice yearly, during health system contacts. This should be marked on the child health card, or integrated into other public health programmes aimed at improving child survival, such as polio or measles national immunization days, or biannual chi ld health days delivering a package of interventions such as deworming, distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets and immunizations. A quality assurance process should be established to guarantee that supplements are manufactured, packaged and st ored in a controlled and uncontaminated environment ( 23). When determining the vitamin A status of a population, guidelines on indicators for assessing vitamin A deficiency should be referred to ( 24, 25). Recommendations for the treatment of xerophthalm ia and the use of vitamin A supplements during episodes of measles are not covered in this guideline. Existing guidelines on the treatment of xerophthalmia and measles in infants and children 6 -59 months of age should be referred to in these cases (8, 26). 7 Vitamin A supplementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age WHO | Guideline policies, appropriate delivery and communication channels, and potential stakeholders and suppliers. Ideally, interventions should be implemented as part of an integrated strategy that includes control of nutritional deficiencies ; the programme should begin as a pilot and scaled up as the evidence grows and resources allow. To ensure that WHO global guidelines and other evidence -informed recommendations for micronutrient interventions are better implemented in low- and middle -income countries, the Department of Nutrition for Health and Development works with the WHO Evidence -Informed Policy Network ( EVIPNet ) programme. EVIPNet promotes partnerships at country level between policy -makers, researchers and civil society to facilitate policy development and implementation through use of the best available evidence. Monitoring and evaluation of guideline implementation A plan for monitoring and evaluation with appropriate indicators is encouraged at all stages. The impact of this guideline can be evaluated within countries (i.e. m onitoring and evaluation of the programmes implemented at scale) and across countries (i.e. the adoption and adaptation of the guideline globally). The WHO Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, Micronutrients Unit, jointly with the Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention (CDC) International Micronutrient Malnutrition Prevention and Control (IMMPaCt) programme, and with input from international partners, has developed a generic logic model for micronutrient interventions in public health to depict these plausible relationships between inputs and expected MDGs by applying the micronutrient programmes evaluation theory ( 27). Member States can adjust the model and use it in combination with appropriate indicators for designing, implementing, mon itoring and evaluating the successful scaling- up of nutrition actions. For evaluation at the global level, the WHO Department of Nutrition for Health and Development is developing a centralized platform for sharing information on nutrition actions i n public health practice implemented around the world. By sharing programme details, specific country adaptations and lessons learnt, this platform will provide examples of how the guidelines are being translated into nutrition actions. To be successful, t his platform will need to be a collaborative effort, where the work of the entire international community can be shared, so countries worldwide can benefit as they attempt to implement nutrition actions. 8 Vitamin A supplementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age WHO | Guideline Implications for future research Guideline development process Discussion with the guideline group members and the External Experts and Stakeholders Panel highlighted the limited evidence in some areas, meriting further research o n vitamin A suppl ementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age , in particular, in the following areas: effect of different doses of vitamin A on the critical outcomes of morbidity and mortality, and stratification of the data by sex, length of follow- up, vaccinati on status and subsequent vitamin A supplementation; the role of vitamin A supplementation in countries with high measles immunization rates and its effect on measles -related mortality; comparative analysis of the different delivery mechanisms of vitamin A (capsules versus droppers for delivery of supplemental vitamin A, food fortificants); identification of field -friendly clinical and biochemical indicators of vitamin A status and vitamin A stores; co-interventions that may interact with vitamin A, for example other nutrients (such as vitamin D) and vaccines (such as diphtheria, tetanus, polio). This guideline was developed in accordance with the WHO evidence-informed guideline development procedures, as outlined in the WHO handbook for guideline development (28). Advisory groups A WHO/United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Steering Committee for Guidelines on Vitamin A Supplementation was established in 2009 with representatives from the WHO departments of Child and Adolescent Health and Development; Imm unizations, Vaccines and Biologicals; Making Pregnancy Safer; Nutrition for Health and Development; Reproductive Health and Research; and the Nutrition Section of UNICEF (Annex 2). The Steering Committee guided the development of this guideline and provided overall supervision of the guideline development process. Two additional groups were formed: an advisory guideline group and an External Experts and Stakeholders Panel. The Vitamin A Supplementation Guideline Group included experts from various WHO expert advisory panels and those identified through open calls for specialists, taking into consideration a balanced gender mix, multiple disciplinary areas of expertise and representation from all WHO regions (Annex 3). Efforts were made to include conte nt experts, methodologists, representatives of potential stakeholders (such as managers and other health professionals involved in the health -care process) and consumers. Representatives of commercial organizations may not be members of a WHO guideline gro up. The role of the guideline group was to advise WHO on the 9 Vitamin A supplementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age WHO | Guideline choice of important outcomes for decision- making and the interpretation of the evidence. The External Experts and Stakeholders Panel was consulted on the scope of the document, the question s addressed and the choice of important outcomes for decision -making, as well as with regard to review of the completed draft guideline (Annex 4). This was done through the WHO Micronutrients and SCN mailing lists, which together include over 5500 subscrib ers, and through the WHO nutrition web site. Scope of the guideline, evidence appraisal and decision -making An initial set of questions (and the components of the questions) to be addressed in the guideline was the critical starting point for formulating the recommendation; the questions were drafted by technical staff at the Micronutrients Unit, Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, in collaboration with the Nutrition Section of UNICEF, based on po licy and programme guidance needs of Member States and their partners. The population, intervention, control, outcomes (PICO) format was used (Annex 5). The questions were discussed and reviewed by the Steering Committee and feedback was received from 45 s takeholders. The first guideline group meeting was held on 19 -20 October 2009 in Geneva, Switzerland, to finalize the scope of the questions and rank the critical outcomes and populations of interest. The guideline group members discussed the relevanc e of each question and modified them as needed. They scored the relative importance of each outcome from 1 to 9 (7-9 indicated that the outcome was critical for a decision, 4-6 indicated that it was important and 1-3 indicated that it was not important). T he final key question on vitamin A supplementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age, along with the outcomes that were identified as critical for decision- making, are listed in PICO format in Annex 5. The Cochrane Collaboration was commissioned to search, review and generate systematic reviews, evidence profiles and the \"Summary of findings\" table1 (Annex 1). Two existing Cochrane reviews on vitamin A supplementation in children were updated, and the up -to-date Review Manager Software (RevMan) files, obtained from the Cochrane Editorial Unit, were customized to reflect the critical outcomes previously identified (outcomes not relevant to this guideline were excluded). The RevMan files wer e exported to the GRADE profiler software to prepare the evidence summaries according to the Grad ing of Recommendation s Assessment, Development and Evaluation ( GRADE) approach for assessing the overall qual ity of the evidence 1 As part of the Cochrane pre -publication editorial process, reviews are commented on by external peers (an editor and two referees external to the editorial team) and t he group's statistical adviser (http://www.cochrane.org/ cochrane -reviews). The Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions describes in detail the process of preparing and maintaining Cochrane systematic reviews on the effects of health -care interventions. 10 Vitamin A supplementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age WHO | Guideline Management of conflicts of interest According to the rules in the WHO Basic documents (30), all experts participating in WHO meetings must declare any interest relevant to the meeting prior to their participation. The conflict s of interest statements for all guideline group members were reviewed by the responsible technical officer and the relevant departments before finalization of the group composition and invitation to attend a guideline group meeting. All guideline group members and participants of the guideline development meetings submitted a Declaration of Interest s Form along with their curri culum vitae before each meeting. In addition, they verbally declared potential conflicts of interest at the beginning of each meeting. The procedures for management of conflicts of interests strictly followed the WHO Guidelines for declaration of interests (WHO experts) (31). The potential conflicts of interest declared by members of the guideline group are summarized below. Professor Michael Clarke declared being Director of the UK Cochrane Centre and a member of The Cochrane Collaboration. Professor Clark e was not personally involved in the preparation or management of the systematic reviews on vitamin A supplementation used for this guideline, although some of his colleagues were involved. (29) (Annex 1). GRADE considers: the study design; the limitations of the studies in terms of their conduct and analysis; the consistency of the results across the available studies; the directness (or applicability and external validit y) of the evidence with respect to the populations, interventions and settings where the proposed intervention may be used; and the precision of the summary estimate of the effect. Both the systematic reviews and the GRADE evidence profiles for each of the critical outcomes were used for drafting the guideline. A second guideline group meeting was held on 16 -18 March 2011 in Geneva, Switzerland, to review the evidence, discuss the draft recommendation, and to determine its strength, taking into consideration: (i) desirable and undesirable effects of this intervention; (ii) the quality of the available evidence; (iii) values and preferences related to the intervention in different settings; and (iv) the cost of options available to health -care workers in different settings (Annex 6). Consensus was defined as agreement by simple majority of the guideline group members. WHO staff present at the meeting as well as other external technical experts involved in the collection and grading of the evidence were not allowed to vote. There were no strong disagreements among the guideline group members. The External Experts and Stakeholders Panel was again consulted on the draft guideline. Feedback was received from 12 stakeholders. WHO staff then finalized th e guideline and submitted it for clearance by WHO before publication. 11 Vitamin A supplementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age WHO | Guideline Plans for updating the guideline Dr Jean Humphrey declared that her research unit received research grants from 1996 to 2009 for the Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies Project (ZVITAMBO) from various organizations, including the Nestl\u00e9 Foundation, BASF, and the Pediatric AIDS Foundation, which receives its core funds from various organizations in cluding Johnson & Johnson and the Abbott Fund. Sub -studies were also supported by Support for Analysis and Research in Africa (SARA) and Linkages Projects, both managed by the Academy for Educational Development (AED). To our knowledge, other than BASF, no ne of these companies nor their commercial sponsors directly or indirectly produce vitamin A supplements. Dr Charles Stephensen declared receiving research funds from WHO for the conduct of a human study on the efficacy of newborn vitamin A supplementati on in improving immune function and from the United States National Institutes of Health for the conduct of studies on vitamin A and immune function in mice. Dr Sherry Tanumihardjo declared receiving remuneration as a technical consultant for the Internat ional Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and an honorarium from HarvestPlus. She also received research support from: HarvestPlus for a vitamin A efficacy study in Zambian children fed orange maize and for a banana study in gerbils to determine the vitamin A valu e of provitamin A carotenoids; the United States National Institutes of Health for developing a 13C retinol isotope dilution test; the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the use of -retinol as a chylomicron tag in rats and pigs; and WHO fo r mechanistic studies to understand neonatal vitamin A supplementation using the sow- piglet dyad model. In addition, she received reimbursement for travel expenses from IAEA, HarvestPlus and WHO to attend meetings. To our knowledge, neither HarvestPlus nor its commercial sponsors directly or indirectly produce vitamin A supplements. External resource persons were invited to the meetings as observers and to provide technical input, but they did not participate in the decision- making processes. The recommen dation in this guideline will be reviewed in 2016. If new information is available at that time, a guideline review group will be convened to evaluate the new evidence and revise the recommendation. The Department of Nutrition for Health and Development at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, along with its internal partners, will be responsible for coordinating the guideline update, following the formal WHO handbook for guideline devel opment (28) procedures. WHO welcomes suggestions regarding additional questions for evaluation in the guideline when it is due for review. 12 Vitamin A supplementation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age WHO | Guideline 1.

Detection bia s put the results of Daulaire (1992) at a high risk of bias. Attrit ion bias was considered to put the results of Chowdhury (2002) at a high risk of bias. Baseline imbalance was noted for Agarwal (1995). 3 The wide confidence intervals around the pooled effect estimate included both a reduction and an increase in the risk of mortality with vitamin A.

Should vitamin A supplements be given to infants a nd children 6-59 months of age? b. If so, at what dose and frequency? Questions in Pop ulation, Intervention, Control, Outcomes (PICO) format Population: Infants and children 6 -59 months of age living in countries where vitamin A deficiency may be of publ ic health concern Subpopulations: By child (under 5) mortality rates: countries with low versus high rates By interaction with immunization: children receiving vitamin A around the time of measles vaccination versus other times By child HIV status: HIV -positive versus HIV-negative versus mixed/unknown By exposure to additional vitamin A: children who also received vitamin A supplementation during the first 28 days of life and/or at 1-5 months of age versus those who had not received vitamin A before Inter vention: Any oral vitamin A supplement Subgroup analyses: By dose: standard dose (100 000 IU for children 6 -11 months of age and 200 000 IU for children 12 -59 months of age) versus other doses By frequency: every 4 -6 months versus other By timing: receip t of first dose at 6 months of age versus at 9- month measles contact v ersus other Control: Placebo or no treatment Outcomes: Setting: Critical Mortality within the follow -up period: Any cause Acute respiratory infections Diarrhoea Measles Hospitalization/clinic visits (number and duration) within the follow -up period: Any cause Acute respiratory infections Diarrhoea Adverse effects within 72 hours after receiving supplement Vomiting Others All countries Vitamin A supplement ation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age 24 WHO | Guideline Quality of evidence: Moderate quality of evidence for most critical outcomes Low quality of evidence for the side-\u00ad effect of vomiting Values and preferences: This intervention has been in p lace for many years now and is acceptable to most but not all Other options (i.e. fortification) may be preferred in order to reach a larger proportion of the target population Trade-\u00ad off between benefits and harm: There is benefit of reducing mortality w ith few side -\u00ad effects However, one cannot rule out that in certain settings there may not be a benefit There is concern that those who need this intervention the most may not be reached Costs and feasibility: Capsules are available at a minimal cost There is a moderate cost of delivering the intervention In the least developed countries, coverage of vitamin A supplementation is the highest, so there is evidence that these children can be reached Child health days are one mechanism by which countries may de liver a set of interventions to large proportion of the population (along with deworming, bed nets) Programmes delivering vitamin A alone (without other interventions) may be more costly There is a need to have a fixed place and time for distribution of th is and other health interventions Longer -\u00adterm solutions may be needed Summary of considerations for determining the strength of the recommendation Annex 6 Vitamin A supplement ation in infants and children 6 -59 months of age 25 WHO | Guideline For more information, please contact: Department of Nutrition for Health and Development World Health Organization Avenue Appia 20, CH- 1211 Geneva 27, 978 92 4 150176 7 "}
