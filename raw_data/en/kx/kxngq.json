A biological assay suitable for assessing the antiadherent activity of botanicals, and using biological relevant P-fimbriated E. coli (ATCC E. coli strains 25922, 29194, 49161, 53498, and cells (T24, ATCC HTB-4) was developed to guide fractionation of VM products. Guided fractionation lead to an antiadherent fraction containing new compounds 10- 10- a number of flavonoids prunin and phloridzin. While the entire fraction was antiadherent, compounds tested were not individually active; related compounds may explain the activity of the whole fraction. In addition to a chemical analysis of the above compounds and a description of the antiadherent assay used, this dissertation includes data on urinary metabolite hippuric acid and the related drop in urinary pH seen after ingestion of cranberry juice cocktail. Also presented are the newly characterized compounds in the context of a comprehensive list of the known constituents of VM, SEM images of a Stevens variety sample, and a suitable HPLC method for identification and standardization of cranberry products. 1I. INTRODUCTION Purpose A thorough body of scientific research supporting the health benefits and medical uses of a given botanical dietary supplement is rare, and the amount of research for cranberry ( Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton , hereinafter designated VM) is no exception. While a number of studies have been published, a more complete knowledge of the health benefits, mechanisms of action, and constituents of this botanical dietary supplement is still needed. One of the primary uses of cranberry is in the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTI), usually caused by Escherichia coli . Research is especially important to validate this current use, in order to assist in the clinical management of urinary tract infections, and to verify the content and efficacy of commercial VM products used in UTI treatment. The current work contributes to this ongoing characterization of VM by describing a bioassay for the assessment of antibacterial activity specific to UTI (antiadherent activity), as well as outlining a suitable fractionation process for use in the search for active VM compounds. New compounds 10- p-cis-coumaroyl -6,7-dihydromonotropein, 10-p-trans- coumaroyl -6,7-dihydromonotropein, O-(3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)-2,4,6-trihydroxyphenylmethylacetate (jaboticabin), were identified from cranberry with these fractionation and bioassay procedures. In combination with other compounds, these compounds help to identify the antiadherent VM fraction. Also provided is a preliminary analysis of urine obtained 2 from subjects after cranberry juice cocktail ingestion, which indicates that mechanisms previously thought responsible for prevention of UTI by cranberry (pH and hippuric acid content) may yet have some validity. A comprehensive listing of constituents of cranberry known at this time, plus SEM images of a Stevens variety VM sample, add to the scope of this work. Chemical characterization of VM Over 350 compounds have been identified in VM(Appendix A), and a few studies have also reported biological activity for these compounds. The red and purple pigments present in cranberry consist primari ly of six anthocyanins: three glycosides of cyanidin and three of peonidin ( 1 ); recently, 1 delphinidin, malvinidin, and pelargonidin glycosides have R2R1 OHHO R3 and Flavonoids (B). A: Cyanidin: R 1 = OH, R2 = H, R 3 = OH; Peonidin: R 1 = OMe, R 2 = H, R 3 = OH; Delphinidin: R 1 = OH, R 2 = OH, R 3 = OH; Malvinidin: R 1 = OMe, R 2 = OMe, R 3 = OH; Pelargonidin: R 1 = H, R 2 = H, R 3 = OH; B: Quercetin: R 4 = OH, R 5 = H, R 6 = OH; Myricetin: R 4 = OH, R 5 = OH, R 6 = OH; Kaempferol: R 4 = H, R 5 = H, R 6 = OH;O-glycosides: primarily at R 3and R 6 for anthocyanins and flavonoids, respectively.3 Cranberry has been assessed for total anthocyanin content1-21 as well as the individual anthocyanins.1,4,11,12,18,22-34 Total consisting of the common flavonoid aglycones quercetin, myricetin small amounts of kaempferol, plus several related glycosides 14,18,36-43 were recently more completely described by Vvedenskaya et al. , along with new coumaroyl and of these Two genistein, were isolated by Liggins et al.,45 although it is unclear from this publication whether the 'cranberry' in question was Vaccinium macrocarpon , or V. oxycoccus , the European cranberry. Total acid content was a primary interest of earlier researchers,15,46-50 and several non-aromatic organic acids (primarily quinic, malic, citric, shikimic and oxalic)7,17,20,47,51-69 have been identified in this highly acidi c fruit. Aromatic organic acids include substantial concentrations (up to 0.1%53,70) of benzoic acid.7,39,41,47,51,61,62,64,66,70-75 Numerous additional aromatic acids and other aromatic compounds include resveratrol,41,76 acid esters, various phenylpropanoids, and other aromatics.7,18,39,41,47,51,61,62,64,66,71-89VM has been assessed by a few research groups for total phenolics, generally proportional to antioxidant power. 12,13,18,35 Fermentation by Serratia vaccinii appears to increase phenolic content and antioxidant activity.90 Typical of fruits, VM contains several monosaccharides and small oligosaccharides,7,15,17,46,91-94 as well as various classes of polysaccharides.7,15,47- 49,59,91,95 The essential oil of VM, as well as the waxy cuticle and the seeds of this fruit, contain the bulk of cranberry's aliphatic constituents,51,71,72,77,78,96-98 carotenoids and 4 tocopherols,7,47,53,59,99-101 and terpenes,51,71,72,77,78,86,92,97,102-104 although many of these compounds are found in the remainder of the fruit as well. Again in two publications, on tocopherols 100 and carotenoids,101 it is unclear whether the species examined was VM orV. oxycoccus. Phospholipids were generally identified by Croteau et al. ,92 although complete identification has not been made. Researchers have found other constituents, including a small group of heterofurans,71,77,78 enzymes,33,105-108 two monotropein iridoids65 related to the two described in this dissertation,109 various nitrogenous compounds (primarily amino acids and the B vitamin group),59,77,110 and assessed total protein content.15,47-49,59,94 Mineral content has also been evaluated.47,53,59,94,111 VM proanthocyanidin oligomers of (-)-epicatechin7,12,13,33,112-116 have recently received attention as possible inhibitors of E. coli adherence.112,113,117 Larger proanthocyanidins (oligomers of five or more units) may also have a positive effect in autoimmune diseases. 118 Biological Activity Many VM compounds are polyphenols, and contribute to the high antioxidant activity of this botanical. 18,36,90,119-131 Antioxidant activity is partially or wholly responsible for some of the other beneficial effects of VM, including specifically inhibition of LDL oxidation,36,132-134 and the related activity are attributed to phenolics, with a synergistic increase in activity on addition of ellagic and rosemarinic acids.136 Activity against cancer cell lines128,137 and tumor inhibition138 may be due to triterpene hydroxycinnamates.86 Cardiovascular benefits include cardiothelial relaxation via NO induction,139-141 and possible anti- atherosclerotic activity.142 Some recent research has focused on inhibition of bacterial biofilms and periodontitis for dental applications.143-145 Other beneficial effects include improvement in skin condition in urostomy patients,146 increase in vitamin B12 absorption,147 and improvements for fibromyalgia patients.148VM was shown to be active against a few microbes other than E. coli ,149-151including poliovirus,152 and demonstrated some antifungal activity.153,154 The effect of VM on urinary tract stone formation is debatable, but, at least for calcium- and magnesium-based stones, appears to be beneficial. 155-160 Case reports of a food-drug interaction between cranberry and warfarin metabolism161,162 are not supported by one mechanistic study of cranberry with flurbiprofen metabolism163 (CYP2C9 metabolic path similar interact with cyclosporin164 (CYP3A and P-glycoprotein paths). Cranberry and other fruits may lower cholesterol by binding bile acids.165 Knowledge of the urinary metabolites of VM is limited, consisting primarily of studies on urinary pH conducted as early as 1914.53,70,156,157,166-170 In addition to urinary pH, some early researchers examined the increased excretion of hippuric acid, 53,70,171,172 calcium,156 and phenolics.1246 VM use in Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Up to a third of all women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) during their lifetime, and the probability increases with age.173,174 Cranberry, generally in the form of cranberry juice cocktail ( CJC), is a popular botanical dietary supplement175,176 primarily used for the treatment and prevention of UTIs, with documented human use for at least 47 years: Bodel and colleagues172 first introduced this use into the medical literature in 1959, and their work was noted at the time as a new use for cranberry.177 Several authors have misquoted the work of Blatherwick from 1914166 on urinary pH after cranberry ingestion as a study on urinary tract infection. This author does not make any mention of this disease in his papers; he reported on the potential health benefits of blood and urine pH shifts from various foods. Other authors 178claim an even earlier use of cranberry for UTI; it is likely that they have incorrectly or \"wild\" cranberry ( 19 th Century texts179 is VM. Likewise, recent authors have claimed historic Native American use of cranberry for UTI, but there is no evidence for this use.180 Thus, although this remedy has widespread popular support, claims that cranberry is a 'traditional' remedy for UTI with longstanding use appear to be invalid. Despite the lack of extensive historic use of VM for UTI, this botanical remedy has widespread popular support, and, from the scientific community, 14 clinical trials of varying quality. 169,181-190 Most of the clinical data supports VM use for UTI, however, three of these 14 trials did not find cranberry to be effective.167,191,192 It should be noted 7 that the subjects in two of these negative trials were children with neuropathic bladder and catheterization. Unlike uncomplicated UTI,173 catheterization can introduce many foreign infectious agents, and is therefore associated with a higher incidence of UTIs that are not caused by E. coli . Infection by pathogens other than E. coli may, therefore, account for the cranberry's negative outcome in these two trials involving patients with catheterization. The majority of clinical trials studying VM use in UTI are of small size and/or poor quality (uncontrolled, not blinded, or otherwise flawed), but the study by Avorn and colleagues 181 on 153 elderly women was double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled, and demonstrated the effectiveness of VM for both treatment and prevention of UTI. Additional tr ials of sufficient size and q uality would be beneficial. Mechanism of action of VM against UTI Although E. coli is the primary causative agent in UTI,167,173 relatively few VM compounds have been examined for activity against this bacterial species. UTI activity byVM was originally believed to be due to its acidifying effect on urine, 186 and/or the increased excretion of the cranberry urinary metabolite hippuric acid,168,170 although even the earliest researchers questioned whether the bacteriostatic impact from VM acidification, or from an increase in hippuric acid concentration, could account for the decrease in UTI symptoms or the decrease in quantity of urinary bacteria observed. 172,193,194 There is in vitro evidence, as mentioned above, for inhibition of 8 adherence of Escherichia coli to uroepithelial cells193 by proanthocyanidins.112,113,117 Inhibition of adherence, rather than direct bacteriostatic or bactericidal activity, has recently been proposed as the mechanism of action.112,113,117,193 Uropathogenic strains of E. coli exhibit P-type fimbriae (pili) containing the papG protein specific for attachment to uroepithelial cells ( Fig. 2 ).195,196 Attachment is necessary for infection, because an infectious colony can infiltrate the surface tissue, while unattached bacteria are washed out of the urinary tract with urine. VM has been shown, in vitro , to prevent uropathogenic Escherichia coli from adhering to uroepithelial cells, 117,193,194 and to a variety of surfaces,197-199 to inhibit aggregation of bacteria,199,200 aggregation of bacteria with yeast,201,202 and aggregation of bacteria with red blood cells.200-202 On longer exposure, VM adjusted to pH 7 significantly changed the morphology of E. coli, resulting in a loss of adhering P-type fimbriae,203 or a change in fimbriae conformation that resulted in lower adhesion strength,178 without actually killing the bacteria. Cranberry's inhibition of bacterial adherence to human cells has also been demonstrated with other strains of bacteria, including Helicobacter pylori 204,205 and Fusobacterium nucleatum.199 Specifically relevant to use for UTIs, there is support for cranberry's inhibition of the papG fimbrial attachment178,203 of uropathogenic coli to human cells202 by cranberry's A-type proanthocyanidin compounds, but dimer or the (-)- epicatechin monomer.112,113 As will be discussed below, however, intact proanthocyanidins may not be assimilated in the gut and/or reach the urinary tract.206-2089 Figure 2.

Human receptor with lipid side chains (bottom) that reside in the cell membrane, and oligosaccharide receptor (top). The two saccharides in bold are the primary binding site, a digalactose moiety equivalent to the known papG ligand galabiose.211 Mechanism of action of urinary metabolites Urine from subjects who have ingested VM has also been shown to inhibit, in vitro, the binding of E. coli to uroepithelial cells193,194,212 and to silicone rubber,208 10 suggesting that active constituents or active metabolites are contained in the urine. It has been suggested that the active metabolites may be derived specifically from proanthocyanidins, as published in a meeting abstract: 213Urine from mice that were fed a cranberry proanthocyanidin fraction (not defined in detail) inhibited E. coli adhesion. Additional research is needed to verify these findings and to characterize the proanthocyanidin fraction in question. Inhibition of adherence appears, therefore, to be an important factor, but proanthocyanidins may not provide the entire answer. In particular, other classes of phytoconstituents have to be considered to contribute to the overall beneficial effect. In addition to the potential for other antiadherent VM constituents, earlier suggestions of the antibacterial action of urinary pH drop and hippuric acid concentration increase from VM are possible mechanisms that deserve another look, especially as they may augment antibacterial effects when in combination with antiadherence activity. Bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity Benzoic acid, a constituent of cranberry in significant concentrations, and hippuric acid, its urinary metabolite, are both bacteriostatic or bactericidal, dependent on concentration and pH. Historically, because of limiting pH and concentration (which we will discuss in greater depth below), the bactericidal activity of cranberry and of the cranberry urinary metabolite hippuric acid have been dismissed as unlikely to be the mechanism of action in VM treatment of UTI. Unfortunately, and with the exception of 11 one case,197 however, it is unclear from the literature117,193,194,199,200 whether researchers have confirmed that the observed 'antiaherence' activity was actually due to inhibition of adherence. It is possible that some observed 'inhibition' was actually due to bacteriostatic or bactericidal activity of hippuric acid (or, indeed, other compounds). Therefore, any research in this direction should make very clear whether inhibition of adherence, direct killing of bacteria, or a combination of these actions is responsible for the prevention of observed E. coli attachment. Metabolism of A- and B-type proanthocyanidins The putative antiadherent principle contain a second link (carbon-oxygen) between at least two of their epicatechin monomer units. The chemically similar B-type proanthocyanidins contain only single, carbon-carbon links between units ( Fig. 3 ). Virtually nothing is known about the metabolic route of A-type proanthocyanidins in humans. With limited recent exceptions for small amounts of dimers and possibly a trimer, 214 the majority of evidence currently indicates that B-type proanthocyanidins, especially trimers and larger, are degraded in the gut, and/or not assimilated in any quantity, and do not reach the urinary tract intact. 215-226 Whether this information can be applied to A-type proanthocyanidins is unknown, and should be verified before assuming that these compounds are the active principle in VM. Although a fraction concentrated in proanthocyanidins but not completely defined, fed to mice, produced antiadherent 12 urine,213 to date no researchers have reported on any specific antiadherent VM compounds or metabolites thereof in urine. Benzoic acid and its urinary metabolite hippuric acid have been studied in some depth, however, these compounds have bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity, and are not antiadherent. The search for metabolites with antiadherent activity, therefore, needs to continue.

Toward that end, presented here and in our recent publication227 is an assay suitable for the guided fractionation of cranberry in the search for active cranberry compounds, urinary metabolites, and for the bioactive standardization of commercial cranberry products. Also presented here are data from four-level fractionation of VM, identification of the pair of new 10- p-cis-coumaroyl-6,7- dihydromonotropein together new 2- O-(3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)-2,4,6- trihydroxyphenylmethylacetate (jaboticabin).* The two iridoids are suitable compounds for identification of the active antiadherent fraction of VM. Also reported is an examination of the hippuric acid content and pH of human urine after CJC ingestion. The results of the latter study suggest that this simpler antibacterial mechanism may contribute, in addition to inhibition of E. coli adherence, to VM activity. * While our publication was in press, other researchers also discovered this new depside in Myrciaria cauliflora (Myrtaceae), and have named it jaboticabin. 22814 2. METHODOLOGY Botanical Identification Microscopy. SEM images of two whole-berry Stevens variety VM specimens (not from the lots used elsewhere in this research) were recorded on a Hitachi S-3000N scanning electron microscope, variable pressure range 25 to 60 Pa, accelerating voltage 20 kV, magnification range 25 to 4500x, working distance (WD) 10.7 to 14.6 mm. HPLC method for the characterization of VM. Unlike many botanicals, VM is readily available as cranberry juice cocktail ( CJC) or cranberry juice concentrate ( CJ), thus it is already in fluid extract form. A single 24 hour CJ processing cycle uses approximately 260,000 pounds of pre-frozen fruit (frozen for a minimum 8 to 12 weeks), obtained from a variety of commercial cranberry bogs, and produces 18,000 pounds of concentrated juice ( personal communication, Sara Mosley, Ocean Spray Cranberries, 11/18/02). Since source material comes from a variety of producers, and includes a variety of botanical strains of VM, and no longer contains, in this juice form, DNA for genetic identification, nor cells for microscopic identification, a method for producing an identifying HPLC chromatogram was designed for the two twenty-liter lots obtained from Oceans Spray Cranberries Inc. (#T073101 and Column: GROM-SIL 120 in to 90:10 minutes; held at 90:10 for 20 minutes. PDA detection, 200 to 400 nm. In addition to benzoic acid (Sigma), peaks were matched with ideain (cyaninidin-3- O- galactoside; Chromadex, Santa Ana, CA), resveratrol (Sigma), and the newly isolated trans -macrotropein iridoid.15 Fractionation and Isolation The two Ocean Spray VM lots, received frozen, were thawed and administered directly to the first level fractionation column of this research. Fractionation of VM consisted of four levels: initially following the general guidelines of Kandil et al. ,121 the first column was HP-20 reverse-phase resin. Portions of the active fractions were subjected to silica gel 121 and to a 10 meter Sephadex LH-20 system, but the bulk of the first-level HP-20 active fractions were sepa rated, at the second with HSCCC (high speed countercurrent chromatography; Pharma-Tech CCC-1000, Pharma-Tech, MD), followed, third, by a 4 meter Sephadex LH-20 column. The final, fourth level fractionation was accomplished on a semipreparative HPLC reverse-phase column. Bacterial antiadherence activity 227 guided fractionation through the first three levels ( Fig. 4). All solvents were HPLC grade (Fisher Scientific, Hanover Pk, IL). 16 Figure 4. VMfractionation tree. First level fractionation on HP-20 reverse phase resin with a water-methanol gradient removed 99% of the most polar (inactive) compounds. Experimental second level fractionation was initially conducted on silica (proanthocyanidins did not elute), and on a ten meter Sephadex LH-20 column, where benzoic acid co-eluted with proanthocyanidins. Second level was revised to HSCCC, removing benzoic acid. Antiadherent fraction HSCCC1 was then separated on a four meter Sephadex LH-20 column, resulting in 16 fractions that were further purified by HPLC, with major peaks elucidated by NMR. 17 First Level Fractionation: Two lots of cranberry juice concentrate, 31.8 kg total including water content (approximately 31.5 L processed in two runs, 12 liters and 19.5 liters, respectively), were adjusted on ice from pH 2.4 to approximately pH 5.5 with ammonia (Fisher) *, and were fractionated over 2.25 kg Dianon\u00ae HP-20 (Supelco Co., PA) that had been conditioned with deionized water. Juice was allowed to flow through the column, which retained all colored anthocyanins in addition to other compounds. The first fraction, with mobile phase consisting of the water content of the juice, contained 95% of the mass, dry weight. The subsequent mobile phase sequence consisted of 100% deionized water (10 and 14 liters, first and second run, respectively), followed by 20% methanol in deionized water (8 and 9 liters), then 50% methanol (11 and 19 liters), and finally 100% methanol (11 and 13 liters, respectively). Transitions in methanol concentration were accomplished with a short gradient of approximately one liter, total volume. One liter fractions were collected throughout and tested for antiadherent activity. Second Level Fractionation: Initially, active first-level fractions were subjected to a silica column. Benzoic acid eluted first, however, many compounds, including proanthocyanidins, appeared to be binding irreversibly to the column or were otherwise being degraded. In another column that also was not fractionated further, 500 mg of combined active HP-20 fractions were separated over a ten meter Sephadex LH-20 column (25-50 \u0001m, Sigma; 403 g). Because bactericidal acid, a compound that interfered with the antiadhesion assay, was seen to elute with the putative active proanthocyanidins, a third secondary level fractionation scheme was devised: A majority of the second level active HP-20 fraction was subjected to HSCCC separation on a Pharma-Tech CCC-1000 system (method modified from Baderschneider and * There was some concern that pH 2.4 would be too acid for the column.18 Winterhalter,229 CHCl 3-MeOH-H 2O 10:7:5 solvent system, flow rate 1.5 mL/min, UV detection); the resulting fractions were recombined per TLC into 7 fractions. Third Level Fractionation: The first HSCCC fraction (5.05 g), with antiadherent but not bactericidal activity, an d containing all visible anthocyanins but no benzoic acid, was then fractionated over a four meter Sephadex LH-20 column (300 mm x 25 mm ID precolumn; main column 4 m x 10 mm ID, 108 g total LH-20; isocratic 100% methanol mobile phase) in six lots, and fractions obtained were recombined into 16 fractions per TLC. Fourth Level Fractionation: Seven of the resulting 16 fractions were further separated on a semiprep HPLC reverse phase column (Grom, SIL-120 ODS-4 HE, 300 x 20 mm, 5 \u0001m) on a Waters Delta 600 system with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector, Waters 717 plus autosampler, and M illennium32 Chromatography Manager (Waters CO., MA) at 5 mL/min, with mobile phase a mixture of methanol (solvent A) and water containing 0.1% TFA (solvent B). Various methods were used, including isocratic elution with 55:45 A:B; a gradient of 50:50 to 76:24 A:B over 35 minutes followed by 98:02; a similar gradient from 52:48 to 85:15 (1% per minute) followed by 98:02, and a fourth method with a gradient from 10:90 to 90:10 over 40 minutes followed by 98:02 A:B. Major fractions isolated at this fourth level were sufficiently pure compounds for identification via NMR and other methods. Thin Layer Chromatography Thin-layer chromatography was performed on precoated TLC plates thickness, KGF Si gel 60 and KGF RP-18 Si gel 60, EM Science, Germany, or 200 \u0001m ALUGRAM \u0001 SIL G/UV 254, Macherey-Nagel, Germany) with compounds visualized by spraying dried plates with one of four detectors: 5% H 2SO 4 in EtOH, in acid (specific for proanthocyanidins230,231), or 1% NP (diphenylboryloxyethylamine) in methanol, followed by heating. Compound identification Mass Spectrometry: S o m e VM fractions and urine samples were checked for hippuric acid using LC-MS techniques. For hippuric acid quantification, lower polarity urine fractions were separated on a Waters SymmetryShield 2.1x50mm 3.5um particle size C18 column with the following returning to 80:20 A:B. The column was held at 30 \u00b0C. MS detection was acquired on a Micromass Quattro II triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer, in negative ion electrospray mode. Detection consisted of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) from m/z 178 to 134 (178 as the precursor ion, and 134 as the fragment ion, loss of CO 2 from hippuric acid). Collision gas: argon; pressure: 1.6E-3 mBar; collision energy: 15eV. Exact mass for new compounds was determined using a Micromass (Manchester, UK) Q-TOF-2 hybrid quadrupole/time-of-flight instrument, high resolution, negative ion electrospray mode. NMR: 1H and 13C NMR experiments were 360 and Avance 500 instruments (Bruker, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland), and results analyzed with MestReC (MestReC Software, Santiago de Compostela, Spain) and NUTS software (Acorn NMR Inc., USA). Chemical shifts ( \u0001) were expressed in ppm with and COSY spectra were run for all compounds, as well as 13C APT or DEPT, 20 HMQC and HMBC. ROESY or TOCSY experiments were run if necessary for complete assignment. Other Spectroscopic Methods: IR (thin film on a germanium ATR FT/IR-410, JASCO Inc., MD), UV spectra HPLC data) and CD data (Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter, Perkin-Elmer Inc., MA) were also recorded for select compounds. Identification and Impurity Profiling of Benzoic Acid and Scopoletin. A fraction from second-level HSCCC fractionation, expected to contain benzoic acid, was examined by Birgit Jaki of the UIC Institute for Tuberculosis Research. The fraction was dried thoroughly over P 4O10in vacuo . For NMR testing, 15 mg were dissolved in 0.75 mL CDCl 3 (99.8 % isotopic purity) in 5 mm NMR tubes. The NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 360 instrument. Chemical shifts were referenced to the CDCl 3 signal at \u0001 7.240 ppm and coupling constants ( J) were given in Hz. For all NMR experiments, off-line data analysis was performed using the NUTS software package, Acorn NMR Inc. (USA). For purity profiling, a 1H NMR spectrum of the sample was measured with 128 scans to yield a spectrum suitable for a quantitative evaluation (qNMR). Acquisition parameters were chosen in agreement with a quantitative NMR method recently reported, 232,233 with a better than 2% precision of detection for minor compounds present at ca. 1% abundance. Data processing was performed by Birgit Jaki as described in a manuscript (Jaki et al. in preparation)234,235 developed to optimize NMR parameters for the quantitative assessment of natural products. The best line shape and signal to noise ratio was achieved with a Gaussian factor of 0.05 and a line broadening of 0.3. The digital resolution was increased by adding an equal number zeros at the end of the FID data set (zero fill). To improve integration, the baseline of the FID was corrected, broad water 21 as well as other -OH and exchangeable proton signals were eliminated by repeated simulation and subtraction from the uneven baseline, and, finally, a baseline flattening was applied by nth (n<10) order polynomial correction. The signal at 7.604 ppm of the main component benzoic acid served as a reference signal set to an arbitrary integral value of 100. PCR identification of E. coli P-fimbria strains Bacterial Fimbriae Identification: PCR of papGI, II and III. PapG primers used and PCR procedures performed were as described in Johnson et al . 236 except as follows. Amplification was carried out in a 50 \u0001L reaction mixture containing 10 \u0001L of DNA template, 0.45 \u0001M of each primer and 30 \u0001L of Invitrogen Platinum PCR Supermix (Carlsbad CA, USA). The samples of Manassas VA, USA) were denatured at 95\u00baC for 7 minutes. Then for 10 cycles, DNA was denatured at 94\u00baC for 1 minute, the annealing of primers was at 68\u00baC for 2 minutes, and the extension of DNA was at 72\u00baC for 3 or 5 minutes. This was followed by 15 cycles of denaturing at 94\u00baC for 1 minute, annealing at 70\u00baC for 4 minutes and extending at 72\u00baC for 10 minutes. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and photographed using a UV illuminator. Glass Adhesion assay for inhibition of E. coli adherence . Method, with few modifications, was based on the work of Allison et al. 197 This method incubates E. coli with cranberry products on glass cover slips, and then examines how well the E. coli have adhered to the glass by successi vely plating them, 22 off the glass, onto agar plates. Briefly: a strain of E. coli (105 to 108 bacteria per mL, various strains but primarily ATCC 700336) was incubated with and without VM extract (roughly 10%) for five to ten minutes. 200 \u0001L of this broth was deposited on a carefully cleaned and sterilized glass cover slip, and incubated for one to two hours. Excess broth was rinsed off, the cover slip was lain face down on a blood agar plate for one minute to allow transfer of some adhering bacteria; the cover slip was then moved, face down, onto a second blood agar plate for another minute; the procedure was repeated through a total of six to seven plates. Plates were streaked to spread bacteria, and the resulting colonies were counted after an overnight incubation. Uroepithelial assay for inhibition of E. coli adherence. Uroepithelial Cells. As recently published, 227 T24 human uroepithelial cells (ATCC HTB-4) were grown in culture flasks to confluence in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (MEM; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg PA, USA) supplemented with non-essential amino acids (NEAA; Fisher), and 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Fisher), removed with trypsin/EDTA (1X; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis USA) and transferred to 96-well microplates (Corning Costar #3997, Fisher), 200 \u0001L per well at approximately 0.5 \u0001 10 6 cells per mL, and again grown to confluence in FBS and NEAA fortified medium. On the day of the assay, medium was removed, wells were carefully washed with 200 \u0001L saline, fixed with 100% methanol for two minutes, and dried in a laminar flow hood. In our experience, unfixed T24 cells do not adhere to microplates sufficiently for incubations with E. coli and repeated washings, necessitating that the cells be fixed prior to assay. No difference was seen in bacterial adherence to T24 cells for a few very carefully conducted experiments comparing fixed with unfixed T24 plates (data not shown). 23 Bacterial Preparation. Colony Forming Antigen (CFA) agar was prepared per published protocol:237,238 10 g casamino acids, 1.5 g yeast extract, 0.05 g MgSO 4, 0.005 g MnCL 2, and 20 g granulated agar were autoclaved for 30 minutes with 1 L deionized water. E. coli strains were grown on blood agar for 24 to 48 hours, subcultured onto CFA agar, and grown at 35 \u00baC for 5 to 18 hours to promote fimbrial expression. Bacteria were transferred to saline, vortexed for approximately 15 seconds, and diluted to between 0.075 and 0.085 AU (1 cm path length), and again diluted 1:10 in saline to an estimated 10 7colony forming units (CFU) per mL for immediate use. Galabiose Globotriose both to inhibit the adherence of P-fimbriated E. coli ,239,240 were purchased from Sigma. The structures of the inhibitors were confirmed using NMR techniques (1H,13C, COSY; 360 MHz Bruker). Ligand was dissolved in saline for a 20 mg/mL (58 m M) stock solution for biological testing. Commercial cranberry products. VMfractionation followed procedures outlined above for CJ, and fractions to be tested were dissolved in methanol or methanol-water to a stock concentration of 10 mg/mL .For faster assessment of commercial products (CJC and others) without guided fractionation, a simple one-level fractionation was conducted as follows: CJC or other products, purchased locally, were fractionated over Dianon\u00ae reverse-phase HP-20 resin (Sigma) to remove water and the most polar constituents. Retained material was eluted from the column with 100% methanol (HPLC grade) resulting in a fraction from which the highly polar compounds (99% of dry mass) had been removed, but which still consisted of moderately polar constituents ( Fig 3) that was concentrated in anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, and other compounds. 24 This methanol fraction was dried in vacuo at 37 \u00b0C and re-dissolved in methanol to a stock concentration of 10 mg/mL. Assay for Galabiose Inhibition. Galabiose samples and 96-well microplate in NEAA fortified, citrate containing methyl-mannose (methyl- \u0002-D-mannopyranoside, Sigma). The E. coli - saline solution was added to each well, resulting in a final concentration of approximately 3 \u0001 10 6 CFU/mL bacteria and 1.3 to 13 m M galabiose in a total volume of 200\u0002L per well. The E. coli - sample plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Following incubation, 100 \u0002L was transferred per well to the rinsed, fixed uroepithelial plate, which was then centrifuged at 500g for 2 minutes. The centrifuged plate was incubated in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere at 35 \u00baC for one hour. Following the second incubation, medium and bacteria that had not adhered were removed, and wells were gently rinsed with three volumes of 200 \u0002L saline. Medium (200 \u0002L, RPMI-1640 with L-glutamine, Fisher) fortified with 5% FBS was added to each well. An E. coli standard curve was produced for one empty row of the plate, starting at an estimated 107 CFU/ml medium, with doubling dilutions through subsequent wells. An additional 100 \u0002L of each solution in the standard curve was diluted in saline, plated on blood agar, and grown overnight to provide CFU verification of bacterial concentration. The RPMI-filled plate was optically read with a microplate reader for baseline (typically 0.05 AU), then incubated at 35 \u00baC to a mean optical density of 0.150 to 0.200 AU (four to six hours incubation time) and re-read. Optical densities (and incubation times) outside of these ranges do not provide data that is as well differentiated. Initial concentrations of adherent bacteria were calculated using the standard curve generated: final optical readings, minus baseline, of the standard curve wells were 25 plotted versus initial bacterial concentrations as determined by CFU counts. Inhibition of adherence was determined as the percent difference in initial (adherent) bacterial concentrations, comparing test substances with appropriate solvent controls (e.g., saline, methanol). Up to three plates were run simultaneously, providing data for 60+ samples and controls, in triplicate, plus a standard curve, in one run. Galabiose Inhibition in the Presence of Fetal Bovine Serum. Galabiose was tested, in addition, following the procedure as outlined but with the addition of 10% FBS to the NEAA fortified, citr ate buffered MEM/methyl-mannose medium. As above, care was taken with all steps involving FBS fortified media not to produce bubbles that would interfere with later optical readings. Inhibition of Adherence by Cranberry Juice Cocktail. The procedure for CJC was similar to the above methods for galabiose, using the FBS-fortified medium. The lower polarity CJC fraction, described above, was dissolved in methanol to 10 mg/mL, diluted with medium and E. coli as above to a final concentration of 50 to 400 \u0001g/mL. Control wells contained medium, E. coli , and, importantly, an equivalent volume of methanol. (Solvents, whether methanol, ethanol, or DMSO, are generally bactericidal to some degree, so precise solvent controls are critical; we have not found DMSO to be a suitable solvent for the lower-polarity cranberry fractions, and have successfully used methanol, instead). CJ and fractions thereof were also tested using this method. Parallel Antibacterial Check. To determine whether test substances had antibacterial (bacteriostatic or bactericidal) activity, rather than antiadhesive activity that left bacteria still viable, a parallel plate was incubated containing 10 \u0001L of the above sample-medium- E. coli solution (prior to addition to the uroepithelial plate), mixed with 190\u0001l FBS-fortified RPMI per well. The plate was incubated following the same 26 protocol as above (35 \u00baC for 4 to 6 hours) and optical data recorded. (See also MIC methods, below). Human Study of urinary metabolites and antibacterial activity of urine IRB approval (see APPENDIX B). Full consent was obtained from all participants; no waiver and no modification of the elements of consent were necessary. IRB approval (#2000-0710), initiated November 2000, is current through March 23rd, 2007. Urine specimens were stored and analyzed in the lab with non-identifying labels such as \"Subject 1\" and \"Subject 2.\" No participant identifiers were kept excepting names and signatures on informed consent forms. Subject enrollment. Five adult female volunteers were enrolled in this study. Inclusions and exclusions were intended to prevent the complication of confounding factors and to protect the safety of the subjects. Women who had never had a UTI (as self-reported) were excluded, since these women may have alternative, unknown metabolic reasons for never showing pathogenesis. Planned exclusions also included applicants with current UTIs (the bacteria present in their urine could complicate the assay), applicants on antibiotics or other medications, applicants with hypertension or diabetes, applicants who did not state that they were basically healthy when asked, and those who were pregnant. Applicants who had recently ingested cranberry products were asked to reapply after a suitable washout period. Participants were all female volunteers, between the ages of 18 and 64 years (actual age range 25 to 42), who were UIC students or employees. Because a quarter to a third of women do not respond to VM treatment for UTI, 183,186 it is possible that up to one in three of the subjects in this study might not demonstrate bacteria-inhibiting urine after ingestion of VM. To have a 95% assurance 27 that there were two subjects in the study sample who produced urinary metabolites from VM that inhibited E. coli adhesion, a sample size of five was selected. Subject involvement. A standard consent form was signed by all subjects. Subjects fasted overnight (from 9 pm the prior night until finishing the collection of their urine sample). Between 8:30 and 10:00 am, subjects drank 500 mL of water provided by us. With a specimen bottle also provided, subjects collected their urine for the following three hours after ingesting the water. After collection, the specimen was immediately frozen for later use. On a later date, the procedure was repeated, substituting cranberry juice cocktail (Ocean Spray, purchased locally) for the water, and the specimens were frozen for later use. Storage was at -80 \u00b0C for up to one year. 500 mL, while a larger volume of CJC than may be ingested by some patients under normal conditions, has been used in some research, 160,167,184,191and was chosen to maximize the potential for discovery of active metabolites. Assessment of urine specimens. Because urine samples typically contain large quantities of sodium, MS analysis could not be conducted on the whole specimens. Urine was therefore subjected to HP-20 fractionation, similar to first-level fractionation procedures for VM: Sixteen to 17 ml urine were thawed and fractionated over 12.25 grams HP-20 in a 20 mm diameter column, using a step gradient of 100% deionized water (DI), 50% methanol in DI, and 100% methanol, with six ml collections. The presence of hippuric acid was detected by TLC, and fractions recombined into F1 (early fractions, no hippuric acid), F2 (hippuric acid fractions, with collection through the remainder of the 50% methanol mobile phase), and F3 (100% methanol mobile phase). Fractions F2 and F3 for each urine specimen were dried and submitted for LC-MS detection and quantification of hippuric acid. 28 Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). MIC data were obtained via standard procedures: Sterile MEM was titrated to pH 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0. Two samples of fresh urine from one volunteer, obtained after water (control) and after CJC (verum) ingestion, were centrifuged to remove the majority of particulate matter, titrated in aliquots to pH 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0, and filter sterilized. ATCC E. coli strain 29194 was grown overnight and suspended to a concentration of approximately 1.5 x 10 6 CFU/mL (final concentration 7.5 x 105 CFU/mL) in MEM or control urine at each pH. Bacteria concentrations were confirmed by appropriate dilution, plating on agar, and colony counts after overnight incubation. Hippuric acid and benzoic acid (Sigma) stock solutions (5 mg/mL in methanol) were suspended in MEM or urine for final concentrations of 256 \u0002g/mL and lower per serial dilution; a methanol control was also prepared. Bacterial suspension (100 \u0002L) of specific pH was added to each well of round- bottom 96-well plates. 100 \u0002L of the test substance (hippuric acid and benzoic acid as described, or verum urine at full strength) was added to duplicate wells and serially diluted across the plate. Plates were incubated at 35 \u00b0C for 20 to 24 hours and examined for visible cloudiness indicating bacterial growth. Note: Benzoic and hippuric acids and urine activity after CJC ingestion were assessed with this MIC procedure. Parallel bactericidal/bacterios tatic assessments for the antiadhesion assay were conducted as described earlier. Statistical Analysis Calculations were accomplished with Microsoft Excel 2004 for Mac. Standard curves for the uroepithelial antiadhesion assay were generated using n th-order (n \u0001 3) 29 polynomial fit with r2 >0.97. P for the above and for urine pH and hippuric acid content was calculated using a one-tailed t-test and was considered significant for p < 0.05. Hazards and Precautions UIC procedures are well established for conducting research in a chemistry or biology laboratory. No procedures, situations, or materials encountered in this research were dangerous beyond normal hazards experienced in laboratory work. Research included only a few biologically hazardous materials: Several uropathogenic strains of E. coli, a transformed human uroepithelial cell line (ATCC HTB-4, T-24 cells) , and urine samples were handled with due precaution. Assays were conducted in an appropriate laminar flow hood as necessary using prope r sterilization techniques, and appropriately sterilized disposal. Extraction solvents and all other laboratory chemicals were used and disposed of with due caution and attention to standard safety procedures. Evaporation in rotary evaporators was conducted according to safety procedures as outlined by the manufacturer of the equipment. NMR Spectroscopy and PCR techniques were carried out in an appropriate manner according to accepted practices. Fully informed consent was obtained from all human subjects who donated urine, and no risks or accidents were experienced. 30 3. RESULTS Microscopy Very little microscopic work on VM has been published to date. Vander Kloet241 provided a photographic light image of VM pollen tetrads, plus images of testa of other Vaccinium species. The American Herbal Pharmacopoeia monograph on cranberry242 includes four drawings and six photographic images from light microscopy. The lots of VM acquired for fractionation, bioactivity assessment and compound isolation reported here are from the juice of multiple mixed lots of cranberries that was devoid of identifying cellular material, and thus cannot be examined specifically for microscopic details that would identify variety and strain. Nonetheless, SEM images from a Stevens variety sample (Ocean Spray) are presented in Appendix C for the purpose of improving the sparse literature on microscopic data. Fractionation of Vaccinium macrocarpon HP-20. Preliminary small column separations (HP-20 resin) resulted in four fractions (mobile phase ranging from 100% water to 100% methanol), of which only the fourth, 100% methanol fraction, theoretically containing the proanthocyanidins, was active in the uroepithelial- E. coli antiadhesion assay described herein; scale-up presented similar results. The first, water fraction typically contained 95% of the mass, dry weight, and was not biologically active. Over 99% of the mass (dry weight) eluted prior to the active, 100% MeOH fractions. Purple anthocyanins were visible in the 50% and 100% methanol fractions. Active fractions after scale-up were 34.6 grams, total (Fig. 4 ) resulting from 31.8 kg of cranberry juice concentrate. Preliminary Silica column. A silica column was initially used at this secondary level of fractionation. Although the benzoic acid eluted first, separate from most or all other compounds, the proanthocyanidins did not elute at all, and there was concern that 31 these compounds either bound permanently or were degraded. Silica was thus rejected as a potential separation material. Preliminary Sephadex column and benzoic acid content. Another preliminary second-level run with 500 mg of the active fractions was accomplished on a 10 meter Sephadex LH-20 column. The resulting fractions were examined with TLC (anisaldehyde, vanillin, and diphenylboryloxyethylamine detection systems) with results indicating that the proanthocyanidins are almost exclusively in fractions 65 to 130, and the flavonoids are almost exclusively in fractions 125 to 270 (See Appendix D). Select fractions from the Sephadex LH-20 column were submitted for LC-MS analysis, with results supporting TLC data. Of important consideration, however, was the large quantity of benzoic acid that was present in the early eluting fractions presumed to contain the reportedly active proanthocyanidins. This contamination of the potentially active fraction with a bactericidal or bacteriostatic compound was not only problematic for our assays, but also calls into question the 'antiadherent' activity found by other researchers who may have used similar separation techniques. Wishing to examine the fractions that contained proanthocyanidins (and other compounds) for activity, it became imperative that the bactericidal benzoic acid be removed prior to further biological assay and fractionation. Therefore, 12.9 grams of the remainder of the active HP-20 fraction were subjected to HSCCC at this second level, prior to Sephadex LH-20 and other separation ( Fig. 5 ).32 33 Figure 6. Level 2 fractionation, HSCCC. HSCCC1 had positive antiadhesion activity but was not bacte riostatic/bactericidal. Benzoic acid fraction activity was due in part or completely to bacteriostatic/bactericidal action on E. coli , with probably no specifi c antiadhesion activity. A scopoletin standard was not active. HSCCC separation of benzoic acid. This second-level fractionation was designed to separate benzoic acid from other compounds, and resulted in seven fractions, two of which contained most of the mass of the parent fraction ( Fig. 6 ). The first fraction, at 5 grams, was active, did not contain benzoic acid, and contained all visible anthocyanins. This fraction eluted in the partition range of K < 0.5 (\"A\" group 243), prior to the targeted (for benzoic acid) polarity range (0.5 < K < 2.0; \"B\"). Smaller fractions (\"B\" group fractions) followed and contained large quantities of quercetin, although at a low purity (approximately 85%). As these fractions as well as a quercetin standard (Sigma) were not active in the antiadhesion assay, no further purification was 34 conducted for HSCCC2 through 4. The fifth fraction (\"B 4\", aka HSCCC5), also active (bactericidal or bacteriostatic, but possibly not containing any antiadherent activity) at approximately 5 grams, consisted primarily of benzoic acid (see qNMR results, below) with minor compound scopoletin. A standard of scopoletin was not active in our bioassay (data not shown). This excellent separation of benzoic acid from other compounds was vastly superior to the previous second-level separation using the ten- meter Sephadex LH-20 column (see Appendix D) in which benzoic acid eluted with one of two proanthocyanidin groups. The final fractions (\"C\" group; K > 2) were not active, and were not investigated further. None of the fractions other than HSCCC5 (benzoic acid) retained bacteriostatic or bactericidal activity (and only HSCCC1 was antiadherent), further supporting the importance of separating benzoic acid in the antiadherence-guided fractionation of VM. Identification and Impurity Profiling of Benzoic Acid and Scopoletin. Measured with qNMR techniques, this fifth HSCCC fraction was 97.47% benzoic acid. Seven minor impurities, each in the amount between 0.02 and 1.74%, and including scopoletin (Fig. 7 ), could be detected (see TABLE I). O O HO O2 3 58 OHO AB Figure 7. A: Benzoic acid and, B: scopoletin. 35 To of the scopoletin impurity (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) the1H NMR spectrum of the sample was compared with a scopoletin reference.244 The structure could be verified by the presence of two doublets at 6.273 ppm ( J = 9.5 Hz; ( J = and 3.959 to H-8 and the methoxy respectively. The double doublet at 7.605 ( J 9.5, 0.3 H-3 overlapped with the benzoic acid signal H-4.

Benzoic acid was present at 97.27%; other compounds included scopoletin at 0.31%. 36 Sephadex and HPLC separations. The first HSCCC fraction, mentioned above, which inhibited adherence of E. coli without being bactericidal or bacteriostatic, was subjected to third-level fractionation on a four meter Sephadex LH-20 column (isocratic, 100% methanol), resulting in 16 fractions ( Fig. 8 ). HPLC separation of seven of the 16 LH-20 fractions resulted in isolation of several compounds, including the new iridoids 10-p-cis - and 10- p-trans- coumaroyl-6,7-dihydromonotropein ( 2- O-(3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)-2,4,6- trihydroxyphenylmethylacetate (jaboticabin). Also contained in this active fraction and to cranberry were 1- derivatives of these flavonoids were also present in this active fraction, and are known VM constituents. 44 Structural identification of these compounds constitutes an important aspect of the characterization of the active fraction, HSCCC1. Related NMR and other identifying spectral data are given below. 37 38 Identification of isolates Compound identification was accomplished primarily using NMR techniques, with confirmation of the molecular formulas through high-resolution MS measurements. The following page summarize the analytical details the two new iridoids 1 and 2, and the four compounds that are new to cranberry, the depside -MACROTROPEIN ( 1) Compound 1was isolated in the yield of 6.8 mg from 31.8 kg CJ (83 ppm, dry weight) and elucidated as 10- p-trans- coumaroyldihydromonotropein; the trivial name, trans- macrotropein, was given to indicate a monotropein iridoid of V. macrocarpon origin. The deprotonated molecule at m/z 537.1629 [M-H]- (high-resolution negative ion electrospray) corresponded formula C 25H30O13 (calc. 537.1608). The IR spectra showed the characteristic absorption bands of hydroxyl groups, free acid or ester groups, and alkenes at 3308, 1684, and 1138 cm -1, respectively. UV absorptions at 215, 230 and 315 suggested that 1 had two independent conjugated systems, one of which was aromatic. In the 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (TABLE II), AM spin system signals at \u0002H 7.668 and presence of a trans -ethylene group conjugated with an aromatic ring, and a typical AA \u0003XX\u0003 spin system for 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring protons at \u0002H 7.487 and 6.804 \u0004/H-9\u0004, H-6 \u0004/H-8\u0004, resp.) Hz; H-6b \u0002). In addition to the above observed signals of characteristic spin systems and a sugar moiety, an olefinic proton signal was observed at \u0001H d,J = 1.4 Hz; H- proton 5.514 2.933 (1H, H-5), 2.319 (1H, dd,J accounting for the methylene protons the HMQC spectrum. The 13C and DEPT NMR spectra of 1 (TABLE III) included signals for a trans - ethylene group at \u0001C 114.89 ( d, C-2\u0003) and 147.03 ( d, C-3\u0003), as well as two signals representing four carbons of a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring at \u0001C C-6\u0003 and 8\u0003), and six C-6\u0002). In addition, the spectra showed an acyl group and a carbonyl group at C-1\u0003) and 81.66 ( s, C-8). These NMR data suggested that 1 was likely an iridoid glycoside, and were very similar to those of the known iridoid glucoside, 6,7-dihydromonotropein, recently isolated from cranberry by Jensen et al. 65 The primary differences seen when comparing NMR data of 1 with 6,7- dihydromonotropein, in addition to the trans -coumaroyl signals in 1, were that the proton signals at Hz; lower field (1H, = 11.3) and 4.256 (1H, d,J = 11.3 Hz) in 1, and that the corresponding carbon signal at \u0001C 68.2 ( t, \u0001C 70.88 ( t) in 1. This evidence indicated that the coumaroyl group in compound 1 was connected to the C-10 hydroxyl function of the iridoid skeleton. Additionally, the change in the geminal coupling constants for H-10a and H-10b from 17.5 Hz in 6,7-dihydromonotropein to 11.3 Hz in 1 suggested that the hydroxyl proton had been replaced by a bulky substituent. In HMBC spectrum, \u0003) were observed. This quaternary carbon was correlated with two other proton signals at \u0001H 6.385 and 7.668 (H-2\" and H-3\", respectively). This evidence confirmed that the coumaroyl group must be attached at position 10. Two fragments of m/z 167.0344 and 373.1023 in the negative ion tandem mass spectrum supported this conclusion. 41 The coupling constants of in D 2O) indicated that all of these protons are pyranose ring protons in an axial position, confirming that the sugar substituent was glucose. In the ROESY spectrum of 1, the correlations between H-1 and H-1 \u0004 and one of two H-7 protons indicated that H-1 is in the \u0001 position. Both H-5 and H-9 were observed to correlate with H-6 (\u0003 H 2.174) experiments provided evidence that these protons were in \u0002 orientations, i.e., 1 had the same relative configuration as 6,7- dihydromonotropein. Consequently, compound 1 was deduced to be 10- trans - coumaroyl-6,7-dihydromonotropein and has been named trans -macrotropein. CIS-MACROTROPEIN ( 2) Compound 2 was isolated in the yield of 2 mg from 31.8 kg CJ (24 ppm, dry weight) and elucidated as 10- p-cis-coumaroyldihydromonotropein ( cis-macrotropein). Data for this iridoid were very similar to those for compound 1. Comparing the 1H,13C, and DEPT NMR spectra of 2 with those of 1, the only difference seen was for the proton and carbon signals within the coumaroyl moiety. In the 1H NMR spectra, the 7.668 in 1 to\u0003H 5.858 and 6.914 in 2, respectively. The coupling constant between H-2 \u0005 and H-3 \u0005 differed markedly from 15.9 Hz 1to 12.6 Hz in 2. Comparing the 13C NMR spectra, the chemical shift of C-2 \u0005 was downfield from 114.89 ppm in 1 to 116.89 ppm in 2, while the chemical shift of C-3\u0005 moved to higher field from 147.03 ppm in 1 to 144.32 ppm in 2. This evidence indicated that compound 2 had a cis-coumaroyl substituent, as opposed to the trans - coumaroyl seen in 1. Therefore, compound 2 was determined to be 10- cis-coumaroyl- 6,7-dihydromonotropein and has been given the trivial name cis-macrotropein. 42 Figure 10.

Additional 10-O-substituted dihydromonotropein iridoids: Additional iridoid compounds are likely to be present in cranberry. A1H-NMR analysis of the parent fraction from which the two iridoids 1 and 2 were isolated reveals a total of 4 pairs of doublets between 4.6 and 4.1 ppm with the typical coupling of C-10 acylated geminal 45 protons ( J = 11.1 to 11.4 Hz). While 1 and 2 account for one pair of doublets each, 2 pairs remain, for a possibility of at least two more compounds belonging to the same series of iridoids. At least one compound is highly likely to be a 10- O-substituted iridoid glycoside: a doublet can be clearly seen downfield from the H-10 signals of both 1and 2, centered at 4.329 ppm ( J = 11.4 Hz; Fig. 11 ). Signals for the second H-10 proton for this third iridoid are likely to be found at around 4.2 ppm, overlapping with the signals of 1 and 2(likely a J = 11.4 Hz doublet at 4.205 ppm). While the low available sample mass limited analysis in the present study, furt her analysis of this fraction with regard to the presence of additional iridoids glycosides is clearly warranted. Figure 11 .Additional iridoids. Additional signals (*/**) in the 1H NMR spectrum of the parent fraction, from which 1 and 2 were isolated, revealed the presence of structurally related minor iridoids, indicated by the presence of pairs of doublets with the typical ~11 Hz geminal coupling of acyl C-10 signals at d 4.329 and 4.205 (*a) likely belong to 2 111 12 cis-macrotropein 2 111 12 2 22*a*a***a** 10b46 JABOTICABIN ( 3) Compound 3 was isolated in the yield of 1.7 mg from 31.8 kg CJ (13 ppm, dry weight) and elucidated as 2- O-(3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)-2,4,6- trihydroxyphenylmethylacetate . The high-resolution negative ion electrospray mass spectrum of compound 3 revealed a deprotonated molecule at m/z: 333.0606 [M-H]-, corresponding to a molecular formula of C 16H14O8(calc. 333.0611). The negative ion tandem mass spectrum of compound 3 contained a fragment ion m/z 301, which corresponded to a loss of methanol and indicated the presence of a methoxyl group in 3. The IR spectrum showed the characteristic absorbed bands corresponding to a hydroxyl group, acyl or carboxyl groups, and 1H NMR (TABLE IV) and 1H-1H COSY spectra of 3, only two aromatic spin systems were observed at lower field. One was a 1,3,4-trisubstituted ABX spin system 47 with resonances at 8.0, \u0002), respectively. The other was a 1,2,4,6-tetrasubstituted AX spin system with resonances at \u0001H 2.3 Hz; H-5). In addition to the above signals, a methoxyl and a similarly shifted methylene signal were observed 13C and DEPT NMR signals could be ascribed to a 1,2,3,5-tetrasubstituted aromatic ring containing signals at C- 6\u0002), respectively. In addition, there were two carbonyl signals at 174.34 52.33. The HMBC spectrum of 3 exhibited correlations between the respective protons and carbons, as illustrated ( Fig. 13 ). Compared to what is typical of a free carboxylic acid,246 C-7\u0002 in 3 was shifted to a higher field, indicating that this is the site of esterification, which, by process of elimination, must have occurred between the two rings of this depside. However, the C-7 \u0002 shift supplied only indirect evidence; additional support for this ester configuration was provided by MS data. The positive ion electrospray tandem mass spectrum contained the dominant fragment ion of m/z 137.0239 (C 7H5O3) corresponding to the cleavage of the ester bond ( Fig. 13 ). This ion further fragmented to lose CO, which further supported the assignment of this ester group. The NMR data were consistent with a similar compound (minus the methyl ester: 2- O-(3,4- dihydroxybenzoyl)-2,4,6-trihydroxyphenylaceta te, herein abbreviated BPA) recently discovered in Papaver rhoeas petals, 246 with the exception of the 8.2 Hz coupling constant reported for H-2 \u0002. It is our understanding that this is a typographical error on the part of Hillenbrand et al. ,246 because the presence of three ortho coupling constants is inconsistent with their tri- and para-substituted ring, and, additionally, a matching 2.2 48 Hz meta coupling constant (H-2 \u0001 with H-6 \u0001) is missing from their data. Compound 3 was thus deduced to be 2- O-(3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)-2,4,6-trihydroxyphenylmethylacetate, and given the trivial name jaboticabin.* O OO OMe OH OHOH HO HMBCOH OH OH+ m/z 137.0239 m/z 109.0354MS2 Figure and HMBC correlations for jaboticabin ( 3). It should be noted that it is rare to find depsides in organisms that are not lichens,247 although there is evidence that ionizing radiation, such as that used to preserve foods, can break down quercetin into various depsides.248 Additionally, jaboticabin may be a methyl ester artifact of the known depside BPA result ing from methanol extraction methods, as recently suggested by Reynertson et al.228 These researchers extracted additional plant material with ethanol to control for this possibility, and detected a compound with [M - H] - molecular ion m/z= 333 with the same retention time as jaboticabin, thus they conclude that this compound was not an artifact.

Reynertson and colleagues named this compound jaboticabin after the common name Jaboticaba of their source species.49 authors fail to mention whether they used denatured ethanol, which may contain small quantities of methanol. Whether jaboticabin is in fact a genuine cranberry secondary metabolite, a product of ionizing radiation or extraction procedures, from a lichen contaminant, or some combination of these sources deserves further investigation.

This difficulty is supported by our first-level fractionation, wherein 99% of the solid mass was removed in inactive fractions before the final active 1% was acquired (see Fig. 5 , p 32). Nonetheless, benzoic acid is present in VMat such high concentrations (up to 0.1% per literature, 53,70 and 0.24% in the cranberry juice concentrate used here) that it is easily detected, eluting at 39.6 minutes with the methods described. Of special interest, too, is a peak at 35.4 minutes that is consistent with the new iridoids. Extraction of the full uv spectrum from the HPLC data ( Fig. 17 ) demonstrates that, for matching elution times, whole CJ (lines B and C) and individual iridoid compounds 1 and 2(D and A, respectively) are consistent enough to tentatively assign these iridoids to the peak eluting at just over 35 minutes in whole CJ. Further work isolating these peaks and verifying their content is warranted, and would support the use of this HPLC method for one-step verification of VM identity. Because these compounds are uncommon, they are better markers for VM identification than the proanthocyanidins, flavonoids, and other known cranberry compounds that are listed in Appendix A. Further work could, however, pinpoint other peaks of interest. Ideain (cyanidin-3-galactoside), for example, is a common flavonoid found in cranberry that elutes at 30.01 minutes, consistent with a peak in our full VM lots. 57 Figure 17. HPLC chromatogram of cranberry juice concentrate (CJ). The two lots of cranberry juice concentrate fractionated for this research are shown.

Absorbance units were adjusted by a uniform factor over each spectrum for ease of comparison (data for A were multiplied by 0.1; B by 2; C by 1; D by 5). 59 Assays for biological activity Several biological assays for adhesion of E. coli have been examined. Three were not considered adequate for the current research: Coaggregation assay: The E. coli strains examined in this research do not adhere strongly to each other, thus any inhibitory activity from VM was not apparent. A haemagglutination assay , in use by many researchers, was examined. E. coli is incubated with human red blood cells, and aggregation noted. This method was determined to be too subjective and variable to give reliable results. This difficulty has been noted by experts in the field. 195,196 A glass adhesion assay197 successfully demonstrated reduced adhesion for ATCC E. coli strain 700336 in the presence of VM (Fig. 19 ). However, this assay results in few data points per run and is too time consuming for effective bioassay guided fractionation. In addition, the biological relevance of adherence ofE. coli to glass surfaces, vs.human cells, is questionable. Another confounding factor in this assay was that in all cases of E. coli incubated with VM, initial adherence was actually higher than for E. coli controls. While bacteria were less strongly adhering overall (slid off faster than for controls) the initial higher numbers of adhering bacteria could nullify the positive results. As is the case with most assays that purport to measure inhibition of adherence of bacteria, this method would need an additional step to clarify whether bacteria are viable but unable to adhere, or whether they're actively being killed.60 Figure 19. Glass Adhesion Assay E. coli strain 700336 was run repeatedly. Each run (24 hrs) provided four lines, and each line provides one data point for the slope (or 'slipperiness') of the E. coli with or without extract. The average and standard deviation from eight runs (16 lines for bacteria incubated with VM and 14 for saline control), completed on seven days, is shown. Overall, E. coli incubated with cranberry was \"slipperier\" (with a steeper slope of -0.42) than the same strain incubated with saline (slope -0.33). The steeper slope indicates inhibition of adhesion in the presence of VM. A paired one-tailed t-test of the individual sl opes for each run was statist ically significance (p = 0.0223). Error bars appear to indicate low accuracy, but in fact the slopes of individual lines, indicative of adherence strength, are highly correlated (r2 > 0.99). 61 New uroepithelial bioassay for adherence of E. coli The in vitro bioassay reported here is designed to closely approximate the human system by using both uropathogenic (P-fimbriated) E. coli strains, and the T24 human bladder cell line. Adapted to microplate technology, the relatively high throughput accommodates testing of multiple commercial products at varying concentrations, and thus can be utilized for standardization. The active cranberry compounds found to date, A-type proanthocyanidins, are probably not excreted intact in the urine, therefore testing of other cranberry compounds and their urinary metabolites will be beneficial and can be accomplished with this method. Experiments with known P-fimbrial ligands have validated this assay, and cranberry CJC) demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition. Additionally, this assay was used to guide the fractionation of CJ, resulting in the discovery of new compounds, and identification of major constituents in the active antiadherent fraction. Identification of E. coli fimbrial class. The PCR of the E. coli strains showed that strain 700336 (isolated from a human patient with pyelonephritis) had the Class I allele ofpapG , as well as the Class III allele, in agreement with published data; Class I is rarely seen in clinical isolates. 196 Other strains that had the Class III allele were 49161 and 53498 (both isolated from urine). Strains 25922 (\"clinical isolate\") and 29194 (urine) had the Class II allele. PapG alle les were not detected for ATCC strains 10798 (human feces, diphtheria convalescent) or 11775 (urine). Other fimbriae typically present on E. coli include Type 1. Strains were not examined for the allele responsible for this fimbrial class; instead, Type 1 activity was inhibited with 2.5% methyl mannose. 26362 Identification of Known Ligands. NMR verification was considered necessary because commercially available natural products are occasionally of very low purity;233 additionally, the stereochemistry of these ligands is essential for binding. The structure of galabiose was confirmed to be a combination of 4- O-\u0001- D-galactopyranosyl- \u0001-D- galactopyranose and 4- O-\u0002-D-galactopyranosyl- \u0001-D-galactopyranose in a ratio of 64:100, respectively, calculated on integration of the 5' proton signals at 4.017 to 4.345 ppm. A ratio of alpha and beta forms is expected for anomeric sugars when in aqueous solution. Globotriose was confirmed by NMR to be a mutarotary mixture of the alpha and beta anomers, also as expected. Inhibition of E. coli Strains by Known Ligands .An E. coli strain suitable for activity-guided fractionation of cranberry concentrate and for the testing of cranberry products was chosen based on its adherence and inhibition in the presence of the known inhibitor galabiose. Both of the Class II and one of the Class III P-fimbriated strains tested, ATCC 25922, 29194 and 49161, were inhibited from adhering to T24 human uroepithelial cells by galabiose at 3.9 m inhibition, respectively; n=6.

Urinary isolate ATCC 29194, inhibited 44% by known P-fimbrial ligand galabiose (3.9 m M) was chosen for further work. Relative binding avidity was designated as follows: Low adherence, less than 2x106 CFU/ml. Moderate adherence, 5x106 to 15x106 CFU/mL. High adherence / avid binding, greater than 20x106 CFU/mL. All concentrations of bacteria are based on 200 \u0001L wells, with bacterial adherent to confluent uroepithelial cells on the bottom surface. ns = not significant. nd = papG alleles not detected. Another strain, ATCC 53498 (Class III), only trended toward being weakly inhibited, and inhibition was not seen for ATCC 700336 (Class I and III). These two latter strains may have other adhesins that are not inhibited by methyl-mannose or galabiose, or they may require the higher inhibitory activity of globotriose. Non-P-fimbriated strain ATCC 10798, a fecal isolate that bound avidly, was not affected by the presence of galabiose. Interestingly, ATCC 11775, a strain for which we did not detect P-fimbrial alleles, was inhibited. While inhibition of this strain is not supportive of the proposed mechanism for this assay, it is possible that there were undetected fimbriae that are nonetheless inhibited by galabiose, or that other factors were involved; further testing of this strain is warranted. Relative binding avidity was designated as follows: Low adherence, less than 2 x 10 6 CFU/mL. Moderate adherence, 3 x 106 to 6 x 106 CFU/mL. High adherence, 7 x 106 to 15 x 106 CFU/mL. Very high or avid binding, 65 greater than 20 x 106 CFU/mL. Concentrations of bacteria are based on 200 \u0001L wells, with bacteria adherent to confluent uroepithelial cells on the bottom surface. ATCC strain 29194, with the highest adherent activity that was also significantly inhibited by galabiose, was chosen as the most suitable strain for further work with VM. Addition of FBS to the incubating medium reduced the sensitivity of this assay substantially, but inhibition was still seen fo r high concentrations of galabiose ( Fig. 21 ): Galaboise at 6.5 m Mprovided 17% inhibition and 13 m M (ten times the published IC50 for this compound under different conditions 239) produced a 26% inhibition (p = 0.033 and 0.006, respectively; n = 3). The known ligand globotriose also inhibited adherence of ATCC strain 29194 in FBS-free medium, at concentrations one fifth that of galabiose (data not shown), consistent with data published by others. 239,240 Due to the prohibitive cost and limited availability of globotriose, all subsequent experiments were conducted with galabiose. Figure 21. Inhibition of adherence by galabiose in FBS- fortified medium. E. coli strain 29194 was modestly inhibited by high concentrations of galabiose. Inhibition was not seen for galabiose concentrations below 6.5 mM. * p < 0.05; n=3. One experiment was run in larger, 6-well microplates to accommodate a light microscope lens, with corresponding increases in all cell and reagent volumes (total 2.75 mL per well). The wells were fixed and stained following the final rinse, and examined by light microscopy for total number of adhered bacteria on a mean of at least 66 200 uroepithelial cells. Galabiose (3.9 m M) inhibited adherence by 92% (p < 0.001) compared to saline control, providing direct visual support for this method. No further runs were conducted using this labor-intensive method. This experiment was conducted without fixing the T24 cells (direct examination of adherent E. coli per uroepithelial cell eliminates this need) and using 100 m M citrate buffer at pH 5.0. Therefore, exact comparisons of percent inhibition with other data reported here are not appropriate. We have found that several parameters can be varied in our method still providing effective results, however the percen t inhibition will vary. While we have not done an exhaustive study of all variations, the parameters reported in Methodology (pH, citrate buffer concentration, concentration of E. coli , etc.) have provided the best results for testing of both cranberry fractions and known globoside ligands. Inhibition by Cranberry Juice Cocktail ( CJC).The testing of more complex substances (e.g., fractions of CJ and CJC) requires the addition of FBS to the medium. Addition of FBS may be necessary for several reasons, and we suggest two: First, fetal bovine serum will provide some buffering effect, and the pH shift (a color shift of the MEM pH indicator) is less erratic when in the presence of FBS. Second, and possibly more important, FBS is providing sufficient nutrients that substantially increase the growth rate of E. coli over its rate in unfortified media (data not shown). Without FBS, complex mixtures such as cranberry juice likel y provide substantial nu trients to minimal media, resulting in a higher rate of E. coli growth in cranberry wells than in control wells, leading to the mistaken impression that cranberry is increasing adherence. The addition of sufficient FBS ensures that bacteria are growing at or near their maximum growth rate during the assay regardless of test substance. Addition of complex mixtures (e.g., cranberry) does not increase nutrient levels or growth rate significantly if FBS is present, and thus a major confounding factor is eliminated. However, as seen with galabiose, the addition of FBS also lowers sensitivity, requiring a substantial increase in ligand concentration to see an equivalent inhibition. This may be due to the 67 large concentration of added soluble protein, interfering to some extent with ligand- receptor interactions. We have, therefore, tested complex mixtures (cocktail, concentrate, and fractions thereof) at higher than typical concentrations in the presence of FBS, and have found in particular that lower-polarity fractions of CJC and CJ consistently demonstrate dose- dependent inhibition in this assay ( Fig. 22 ). Fifty percent inhibition was seen at 400 \u0001g/ml (p = 0.006, n = 12) of a first-level CJC fraction. It is hypothesized that inhibition with individual, non-nutritive compounds from this mixture will test positive at significantly lower concentrations in unfortified media, as was seen for galabiose. Figure 22. Inhibition of E. coli 29194 adherence by a lower polarity fraction of Cranberry Juice Cocktail (CJC). Inhibition of adherence in FBS-fortified medium by a CJC fraction concentrated in anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins was seen for higher concentrations. 400 \u0001g/mL 50% inhibition (p=0.002, n=12). Cranberry juice concentrate ( CJ) produced similar results (data not shown). An FBS-free system could, in theory, produce IC50s that are significantly lower. (See text; compare galabiose measurements in FBS-fortified and -free media). * p < 0.05 vs. control. The concentrate ( CJ) produced similar results. 1- O-Me-\u0001- D-galactose ( 4), present in the active fraction at roughly 15 ppm of whole CJ, was obtained in sufficient quantities for testing in the described assay, but did not demonstrate antiadherent or antibacterial activity. Neither of the new iridoid compounds demonstrated antibacterial or antiadhesion activity (TABLE IX). 68 Iridoid activity, 400 \u0001g/mL % inhibition (antiadherent)P % kill P cis-macrotropein ( 2) 4 ns 2 ns trans -macrotropein ( 1) 0 ns 0 ns TABLE IX. Iridoid activi ty. The new iridoids, cis- and trans -macrotropein, were not active in our antiadherent assay, nor did they exhibit bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity. Parallel kill-check plates run for all galabiose testing did not detect any bactericidal or bacteriostati c activity. We have seen cocktail fractions that produced minimal antibacterial activity, but at a rate lower than the antiadhesion activity described above (data not shown). The development of an HSCCC method to remove benzoic acid separated the bactericidal/bacteri ostatic activity (known in the case of benzoic acid) from other fractions that are anti-adherent. Benzoic acid, a known cranberry constituent that is antibacterial, was present in our samples of CJ at approximately 0.24% dry weight. This constituent is detectible by HPLC in CJ (Fig. 17 ); the identity of benzoic acid isolated from CJ was confirmed with 1H NMR (data not shown) and again using qNMR to quantify the percent benzoic acid and seven minor compounds present in second level fraction HSCCC5 (see page 33). Bacteriostatic / Bacterici dal activity: MIC. Benzoic acid is in the fractions of CJC andCJ that have tested positive in this assay, and this compound is bacteriostatic or bactericidal. Thus, the 'antiadherent' activity we have seen when testing fractions containing this compound is at least partially due, not to inhibition of adherence of E. coli, but instead, to this compound's direct bacteri ostatic or bacterici dal activity. It necessary to separate benzoic acid from other compounds to determine the antiadherent activity of the latter, and benzoic acid itself was tested for bacteriostatic activity, as follows. E. coli (strain 29194) growth in urine was not inhibited if the pH was above 4.5, but was limited by the addition of benzoic acid: minimum inhibitory 69 concentrations (MIC) at pH 5.0 and 6.0 were below 64 \u0001g/mL. At pH 7.0, 256 \u0001g/mL benzoic acid was required for inhibition. Growth in MEM gave similar results. Hippuric acid, the urinary metabolite of benzoic acid, was also active at lower pH and higher concentrations (TABLE X): In MEM at pH 5.0 and 6.0, MIC was 64 \u0001g/mL; in urine, pH 5 MIC was 64 \u0001g/mL but at pH 6.0 the MIC was 256 \u0001g/mL, and hippuric acid was inactive in urine at pH 7.0. Urine and MEM media without added benzoic or hippuric acid were not inhibitory above pH 4.5.

Without the presence of hippuric acid, neither MEM nor urine are bactericidal above pH 4.5. Human Study Five female subjects, 25 to 42 years of age, were enrolled. Three subjects had no difficulty with the study. A sixth subject, not assigned to the study, declined to participate after interviewing. Two of the five enrolled subjects did not mention any problems to the study manager during their participation, but later stated that they had trouble with the overnight fast that lasted several hours into the morning. Future studies may be able to rely on a restricted diet, rather than a total fast. 70 This pilot study was not sufficiently large to provide enough materials for the guided fractionation of the urine, in search of active metabolites. Nonetheless, the pH of eight of the ten samples was measured, and hippuric acid content was analyzed for six samples. Analysis of urine specimens. An increase in acidity was seen for all urine samples obtained after subjects drank 500 mL CJC. The mean drop in pH was from 6.9 \u00b1 0.5 to 5.7 \u00b1 0.3 (p = 0.008) .In a preliminary LC-MS check of four samples from two subjects, no (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, or resveratrol was seen (data not shown). Hippuric acid was present in large quantities (TABLE XI; Figure 23 ). Six urine samples (three subjects, control and verum) were analyzed against a hippuric acid standard curve with LC-MS. Hippuric acid content increased from a mean of 29.3 \u00b1 13.7 \u0002g/mL to a mean of 386 \u00b1 256 \u0002g/mL after CJC ingestion (p = 0.037). Total hippuric acid content excreted in the 3 hour collection increased from a mean of 13.5 \u00b1 10.7 mg to a mean of 107.1 \u00b1 42.9 mg (p = 0.01). This is comparable to the quantity of benzoic acid (at 0.24% in cranberry juice) ingested, which would result in a total excretion of approximately 75 mg hippuric acid, including baseline.

DISCUSSION Standardization of botanical dietary supplements is an important step toward ensuring that products available are the correct botanical species, as well as of sufficient quality and efficacy to provide a consi stent biological effe ct. Provided here are the tools to standardize VMproducts based on compounds found in an active fraction (TABLE XII), using a HPLC method focused on the presence of the unique macrotropein iridoids as well as benzoic acid. Additionally, VM products can be more thoroughly standardized based on antiadherent activity using the biological assay described herein. Major Compounds in the Antiadherent Fraction of VM No. Name Class Ref. 1 10-p-trans- Major compounds characterizing the antiadhesive VM fraction. 73 VM, when obtained as concentrate or as CJC from cranberry juice manufacturers, is derived from a multitude of sources: harvests from many commercial cranberry bogs, after freezing, are pulverized and the juice extracted. Thus, the cranberries themselves may be of several different botanical varieties. In the juicing process, genetic material is lost, as are cellular identifiers (whole cells, vessels, organelles, etc.) making it impossible to identify, botanically, a given lot of juice by either PCR or by traditional microscopic methods. Even if the DNA and cellular material necessary for these methods were available in juice, the combination of fruit from a number of sources and botanical varieties would make such identification impractical, if not impossible. An alternative method for verifying the botanical identity of a given sample is to examine that sample chemically, as is reported throughout this dissertation. The HPLC chromatograms ( Fig. 17 ) of the CJ samples fractionated in this research provide a fingerprint that, while not as specific as DNA fingerprints obtained via PCR methods, is still characteristic of VM. In particular, the presence of a large quantity of benzoic acid, eluting at 39.6 minutes using the methods reported here, assists in the identification of VM: only a few other botanicals are known to contain such high quantities of this compound. Some essential oils (especially of Paeonia spp. 264), and the resins of Styrax spp.265 contain very high amounts of benzoic acid, but no fruits that might be substituted forVM are in this category .The roots of Paeonia species contain up to 0.22% benzoic acid,266 comparable with that found in VM fruit, but again, substituti on seems unlikely. A more likely outside source for benzoic acid is from the industrial preservation of food. Considering the likely importance of benzoic acid's contribution to VMactivity, and its potential as a synergistic agent, HPLC identification of VM is incomplete without noting this compound's presence. However, consideration should be given to the quantity of benzoate that may have been added as a preservative to any VM sample. 74 Anthocyanins have historically been used for identification of VM,2,26 probably in part because, being visible, they are easily detecti ble. The six anthocyanins found in VM, however, are found in many botanicals. One commercially obtainable anthocyanin, ideain (cyaninidin-3- O-galactoside), also present in many fruits, elutes at 30.0 minutes in the method described above. It should be noted, however, that \u0002max for ideain (282 nm) was only seen as a shoulder on another peak (316 nm) in our CJ samples at 30 minutes. This compound does not appear to provide sufficient unique information to aid in the botanical identification of VM. Other compounds may be better markers for this botanical, in particular the newly discovered macrotropein iridoids described herein. The cis isomer elutes at 35.1 minutes, and the trans isomer at 35.4 minutes. The full spectrum (200 to 400 nm) of our CJ samples at these elution times contains \u0002max consistent with these iridoids ( Fig. 18 ). Further work should be conducted to verify that the peaks eluting at the above times for CJ chromatograms are indeed primarily these macrotropein compounds. This could be accomplished with the given HPLC method, collecting from 35.0 to 35.7 minutes, and examining this fraction with 1H NMR spectroscopy for the characteristic set of two doublets (both H10 protons) at \u0001 4.1 - 4.5 ppm, with J = 11.2 to 11.3 Hz, a typical coupling constant for geminal protons. In the case of the two iridoids reported here, difference in chemical shift between proton H-10a and proton H-10b is not a the cis isomer ppm (26.6 Hz) for the trans isomer 2; other compounds in this class may also vary. The coupling constant of 11.2 to 11.3 Hz for these protons, however, should be relatively consistent if the H-C-H bond angle at C10 is similar, and can be used to tentatively identify C10- O-substituted dihydromonotropein iridoids in VM. A distinctive botanical identification of VM samples can be accomplished by identifying these unique macrotropein compounds, especially if found in combination with a high benzoic acid content. 75 Fractionation schemes developed and appearing in this study were successful at narrowing down the activity to a small portion of the original mass, and two new compounds, plus four known compounds new to cranberry, were elucidated in the active fraction, as previously stated. This research includes identification of marker compounds in the antiadherent fraction that are not proanthocyanidins. Interestingly, and in contrast to the preliminary second-level LH-20 fractionation described in appendix D, TLC analysis of the fractions obtained from this third level column (pre- processed by HSCCC) did not reveal any pr oanthocyanidins. It is possible that proanthocyanidins require the presence of benzoic acid or some other compound to remain stable and/or in solution. Thus, these compounds may have been lost in the HSCCC benzoic acid separation step. The solubility/stability issue of proanthocyanidins is supported by results from the second-level silica column, from which benzoic acid eluted first and proanthocyanidins did not elute. Alternatively, proanthocyanidins, if made less stable in the HSCCC step, may have deteriorated on the subsequent Sephadex LH-20 column: this column acquired a pink smear for its entire length, which could be consistent with proanthocyanidins degrading to colored anthocyanins. Future use of this fractionation scheme should include an examination of the fate of the proanthocyanidins; if benzoic acid, or some other compound such as a particular flavonoid, is necessary for the solubility or stability of the proanthocyanidins, this is a critical point that must be considered 1. for all subsequent biological assay steps and, 2. for all products purporting to be proanthocyanidin-enriched fractions of VM. Note that the lack of proanthocyanidins in our active antiadherent fraction is further evidence against these compounds as the active principle in VM. The metabolic route of proanthocyanidins in humans is another concern inherent in the designation of these compounds as the active antiadherent principle in VM. Some effects of proanthocyanidins are dependent on larger oligomers (n \u00015) of these compounds, 118 and the antiadherent activity found in VM by several 76 others143,151,200,201,267 was confined to a large molecular weight compound or compounds, consistent with proanthocyanidins. Larger oligomers may be the active cranberry constituents seen in in vitro studies (although one research group has seen activity from smaller oligomers 112,113), but whether these compounds or active metabolites are assimilated or excreted in urine is highly debatable. A third piece of evidence that throws doubt on proanthocyanidins as active antiadherent principle lies in limited research indicating that white cranberry juice, in contrast to the more common red juice, does not possess antiadherent activity.198 White cranberry juice is produced from unripe cranberries. These berries have not yet developed the majority of their red and purple anthocyanins, thus they should, in theory, possess a much higher proanthocyanidin content (the colorless source of anthocyanins) than red cranberry juice. Our preliminary research (data not shown) also did not reveal antiadherent activity for a lower polarity fraction of white CJC in our uroepithelial assay. We have used red cranberry juice throughout this research, as it is more widely available and is traditionally used for UTI. A study of white cranberry juice was beyond the scope of this research, but is warranted. While the activity of proanthocyanidins is questionable, and while we suspect bactericidal activity from acidification of urine and an increase in hippuric acid (see below), antiadhesion activity is also a factor. Our fractionation method led, after the removal of benzoic acid, to a fraction that was neither bactericidal nor bacteriostatic, but was still found to inhibit adhesion of E. coli to uroepithelial cells. The antiadherent activity from this fraction (and, if the above concerns can be resolved, from proanthocyanidins), as well as the bacteriostatic or bactericidal activity of lowered pH and increased hippuric acid concentration, may work in combination to produce cranberry's full effect on UTI. Thus, the identification of some of the major compounds in the antiadherent fraction provides more evidence toward the full understanding of this important botanical 77 dietary supplement. New compounds trans- and cis-macrotropein ( 1, 2) and known compounds new to VM jaboticabin, 1- O-methyl-\u0001-D-galactose, prunin and phloridzin ( 3 -6, respectively), and compounds previously found in this botanical were identified at this fourth level of fractionation (TABLE XII), using primarily NMR techniques. Sufficient information for standardization of VM products lies in identifying both benzoic acid and the macrotropein iridoids, the latter easily identified by their H-10 signals with J = 11.2 to 11.3 Hz. A more thorough identification could include 1- O-methyl-\u0001- D-galactose and a number of flavonoids, including prunin and phloridzin. Jaboticabin, although an unusual compound new to VM, should not be used for characterization of VM products without further research: this compound may be from an outside contaminant such as a lichen species, or it may be a product of ionizing radiation. Many other compounds were clearly present in this active fraction according to HPLC chromatograms, but not obtained in sufficient quantity or purity at this time for NMR structure elucidation. Several flavonoids in addition to prunin and phloridzin (see TABLE XII) were identified by comparing their NMR data with those of Vvedenskaya et al. and others. 36,37,39,44 A limitation of this research is that the specific compounds that inhibit the adherence of E. coli have not been identified. The characterization of an active fraction is, however, a substantial step toward this goal, and several possibilities for activity exist. Flavonoids including anthocyanin compounds probably make up the bulk of this active fraction (including those in TABLE XII). The aglycones quercetin and myricetin did not exhibit antiadherence properties, however, other flavonoids determined to be present are all glycosylated. Because of the additional sugar moiety, which would be more likely to interact with P-fimbriae's galactose binding site, these flavonoids would be 78 good targets for further assessment of bioactivity. We did not obtain these compounds in quantities sufficient for biological testing at this time. The presence of one methoxylated sugar in the active fraction suggests that others may be present. While it is true that this particular monosaccharide was not active in our antiadherence assay, in view of the fact that the disaccharide 1- O- methylgalabiose has nearly ten times the inhibitory effect of unmethylated galabiose, 239 other alkylated sugars would be good targets for activity. A second mechanism of action of VMmay be the bacteriostatic or bactericidal activity of benzoic acid and its uri nary metabolite hippuric acid. Benzoic acid and scopoletin were in a fraction that, while it tested positive for inhibition of E. coli adhesion to human uroepithelial cells, also inhibited the growth of E. coli, and thus, as described previously, possibly has no independent antiadherent activity. (A scopoletin standard obtained from Sigma demonstrated no activity, while a benzoic acid standard was, as expected, bactericidal.) While some researchers have been careful to determine that the activity they were seei ng was not bactericidal, 178,203 many have not stated distinguished antiadherent acti vity from bacteriostatic or bac tericidal activity. Since this second mechanism may be responsible for at least some of the activity of VM against UTI, characterization of this botanical is incomplete without taking in to consideration benzoic acid content. The broad aim of this study was to examine the mechanism of action of VM for \"uncomplicated\" urinary tract infection.173 Thus, a small human study was conducted to collect urine, from which we hoped to find active metabolites. Identification of inhibitory urinary metabolites was to be determined using the PUF assay, 268 which, in this case, used the E. coli P-fimbrial protein that binds to human uroepithelial cells as a receptor to screen cranberry fractions and urine for active compounds. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain results from cranberry in this assay, and suspect that the dissociation constant for the P-fimbrial (papG) proteins 240 is insufficient for this otherwise robust 79 screening method. Additional work to determine urinary metabolites (and, for that matter, other potentially active VM constituents) is thus still needed. Our preliminary clinical trial does, however, provide two important findings: 1. The urine of women who drank 500 mL cranberry juice cocktail, when collected for three hours following ingestion, was of significantly lower pH than urine obtained after the same women drank an equivalent volume of water (pH 5.7 vs. 6.9; p = 0.008); 2. Urine for six samples (after CJC and H 2O from three subjects) was fractionated and assayed for hippuric acid content, which was significantly higher in CJC urine than in control urine (386 vs. 29 \u0001g/mL; p = 0.037). Note that the hippuric acid MIC for growth of E. coli in urine and media at pH 5 and 6 is within a range similar to what was found in CJC urine, thus physiological inhibition of uropathogenic E. coli in human bladders by cranberry juice cocktail is feasible. Admittedly, these data are based on very small sample sizes. Additional studies confirming these results would be beneficial. While earlier authors have suggested that pH or hippuric acid content could not account for CJC activity against UTIs, it is important to note that pH may not have been assessed specifically in the three hours following CJC ingestion. For example, Avorn et al.181 saw no drop in urinary pH after CJC ingestion, but did not state when urine was collected relative to ingestion of CJC. While peak excretion of (+)-catechin and other proanthocyanidin metabolites is seen eight to twelve hours after ingestion,220 a three hour window encompasses the time frame in which early studies193,194 noted peak antiadherent activity for urine. This is also the time frame during which benzoic acid is converted to hippuric acid and excreted in urine. 70,269,270 Some additional hippuric acid may be derived from quinic acid, which is aromatized by gut flora,271 and may therefore, depending on the time needed for this aromatization and assimilation, be excreted over a longer time period. But because researchers have generally not seen a reduction in pH beyond the three hour time window, the contribution of quinic acid to UTI inhibition may not be significant. B enzoic acid may contribute all of the necessary hippuric acid 80 that produces the bacteriostatic/bacteri cidal activity we have seen. A sufficient decrease in pH or increase in hippuric acid content in urine can have an antibacterial effect, and the two work together synergistically. 153,272 Twenty-four hour urine collections may not reveal a large but brief drop in pH, for example, but even a short period of urine at pH 5.0 with sufficient hippuric acid present (a \"pH/HA flush\" of the urinary tract) might result in an eradication of a pathogenic organism. Any future clinical trials should include testing of urine samples at specific times, including 1 to 3 hours after ingestion of VM, to clarify whether pH and hippuric acid content might be a factor in the trial outcome. SUMMARY A reproducible, high-throughput assay has been developed for the assessment of inhibition of adherence of uropathogenic p-fimbriated E. coli to a human uroepithelial cell line. This assay is of benefit in the bioactivity-guided fractionation of proposed antiadherent botanicals such as VM. It seems probable that at least some of VM's activity against UTI is due to hippuric acid and lower pH, and we suggest that this activity combines with the demonstrated antiadherent activity of VM, possibly provided by metabolites of proanthocyanidins, and/or by glycosylated flavonoids, alkylated sugars, or other compounds in our active fraction, to produce this dietary supplement's full effects. In view of the currently available evidence, including results from the present work, the following are potential mechanisms by which the efficacy of CJ in VM can be explained: 1. Benzoic acid acts directly to inhibit growth of or to kill E. coli (bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity). Since benzoic acid is not excreted 81 unchanged in any appreciable quantity in urine, this activity is limited to in vitro studies with VM. 2. A combination of temporarily high hippuric acid and high acidity in urine has bacteriostatic or bactericidal activity. Substantial increases in the concentration of hippuric acid are seen in urine, along with a drop in pH, within three hours of ingestion of 500 mL of CJC. These changes are sufficient to inhibit bacterial growth. 3. Proanthocyanidins (despite unexplained absorption and metabolism) or, more likely, proanthocyanidin metabolic products, may inhibit the adherence of E. coli to uroepithelial cells in urine, as some authors have suggested. 4. Flavonoids and/or their metabolic products (or other known VM constituents/metabolites) may also be inhibitors of adherence of E. coli , or may work more directly as bacteriostatic/bactericidal agents. 5. Iridoids, additional to those identified in this work, might have antibacterial activity. This activity is known in the case of several iridoid glycosides. 273-275 6. Because the galactose oligomers, because methylated galabiose has much higher activity than galabiose, and, additionally, because we found an alkylated sugar ( 4) in our active fraction, alkylated sugars are also very likely targets. The presence of 4suggests that other alkylated sugars may be present in VM and they and/or their urinary metabolites may be active. Searches for these oligosaccharides requires different detection methods than used here (e.g., ELSD) because these compounds do not exhibit UV spectra. 7. Two or more of the above potential activities may act synergistically with each other.82 FUTURE DIRECTIONS Formulation of a standardized VM product While the HPLC method provided should be adequate for identification of VM, a few additional steps will render it superior. Currently we have matched the putative iridoid elution peaks in the HPLC chromatogram with full UV spectra and with retention times of our isolated compounds. The benzoic acid peak in the HPLC chromatogram was likewise matched with a commercial standard. Isolation of the putative iridoid and benzoic acid peaks directly from the HPLC run, and subsequent identification with NMR, will further verify their identity, and would enhance the use of this HPLC method for identification of VM. While large quantities of benzoic acid, plus the presence of the unique iridoids, should positively identify this botanical, additional identification of other peaks in the HPLC chromatogram could improve the method. Specifically, further work could be done to identify other compounds seen in our active fraction (Table XII) within this HPLC chromatogram. Any standardization of commercial botanical products is also enhanced by positive biological activity. In the case of VM, antiadherent activity (using the uroepithelial assay described here, or other assays if sufficiently robust) should be seen both before and after removal of benzoic acid. Thus, the first two fractionation steps described herein will be necessary for any standardization of VM. Additional Future Directions Additional spectroscopic work should be done to verify the glycosidal moieties of the putative prunin ( 5) and phloridzin 6). Also, there are a number of possible iridoids still to be elucidated in addition to 1 and 2, and these may prove to be new compounds, and may additionally have antibacterial activity. Any active antiadherent compounds, if found, will require spectroscopic work for full identification. The promising possibility of alkylated sugars in VM active fractions should be researched, noting that ELSD or other 83 detection methods, probably not used by earlier researchers and not used in this work, are a necessity when locating these compounds. Additional flavonoids, especially galactosides that may be biologically active, are another promising possibility. Fractionation work should include an examination of the fate of proanthocyanidins. Are these compounds lost during the separation of benzoic acid, are they made unstable or insoluble at this stage, or are they lost later, in the LH-20 column? The possibility that other VM compounds are necessary for proanthocyanidin solubility or stability could be examined with HSCCC, because methods using this fractionation technique do not result in lost compounds (irreversibly bound to solid resins or degraded); losses are due to separation of necessary synergizing compounds. Jaboticabin should be researched further to verify whether it is indeed a VM secondary metabolite or a contaminant or artifact. To determine whether its source is a lichen contaminant, several lots of VM from varying years and sources should be examined for the presence of this depside. Absence in many lots would support a lichen source that is not always present. If BPA (the related, unmethylated depside) is present, care should be taken to do an extraction with no methanol (using nondenatured ethanol instead) and look for jaboticabin: none present would indicate an artifact involving the solvent. To determine whether this depside is an artifact of ionizing radiation effect on quercetin, one could attempt to isolate the compound from a carefully protected source of VM, as well as from a source that has been subjected to extreme levels of ionizing radiation. The biological assay, while relatively high throughput, should be revised for improved sensitivity. In particular, the necessity of addition of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in quantities that reduced the sensitivity of the assay and required high concentrations of test compounds, should be examined and rectified if possible. Additionally, further biological work could examine the difference in inhibition seen for the papG Class II vs. Class III strains. We did not see a significant inhibition 84 for Class III strains with known ligands, and while Class II is more common in urinary tract infections, it would be interesting to determine whether VM is also more effective for Class II strains. Although the PUF assay was abandoned in the current work, further work with better crystallization of papG p-fimbrial proteins, and/or modification of the PUF assay to enable the use of proteins with lower dissociation constants, might enable us to use this assay to quickly identify active VM compounds and/or their urinary metabolites. Urinary metabolites should certainly receive more attention; no research, including the current work, has identified any antiadherent metabolites in urine to date. Hippuric acid, bacteriostatic and bactericidal at sufficient concentration and low pH, is currently the only identified active metabolite, and has been known for some time. Certainly the metabolites of A-type proanthocyanidins, and the fate of these compounds in vivo , must be determined if proanthocyanidins are to continue to be considered the active compounds in VM. All clinical trials using VM for urinary tract infection should examine the first three hours of excreted urine following VM ingestion for hippuric acid and pH. If the results of our pilot study are accurate, larger studies should support the pH/HA urinary tract flush as a primary mechanism of action. 85 5.

There was very little overlap in these two classes. As discuss ed above, other compounds of interest eluted with the proanthocyanidin fractions, as well as the bactericidal benzoic acid, so HSCCC was later used at the second level of fractionation for the removal of benzoic acid. For the simple purpose of flavonoid-proanthocyanidin separation, however, this long LH-20 column was an excellent choice, as is illustrated on the following pages ( Fig 30-34 ). Three SIL G/UV 254, Macherey-Nagel, Germany) were run for each of the 300 fractions obtained from the preliminary ten meter Sephadex LH- 20 column; mobile phase was EtOAc:MeOH:H 2O 77:15:8. was detected with anisaldehyde (Anisaldehyde:MeOH:H 2SO 4:MeCOOH 0.75:170:14.5:15). The second plate (central row) was detected with 1% vanillin in a 50% phosphoric acid solution, specific for proanthocyanidin detection. It was determined, after one plate disintegrated, that this solution was too corrosive to use as a dip; all subsequent plates were sprayed with detection solutions. Anisaldehyde and vanillin gave very similar results. The third se t of plates (bottom row) were detected with NP reagent (1% diphenylboryloxyethylamine in methanol), which did not have the advantage of revealing proanthocyanidins, although it provided more detail for individual flavonoids. 104 APPENDIX D (continued) Proanthocyanidins (as determined by pink color after detection by vanillin) were seen in the earlier fractions, primarily in two groups, from fractions 75 to 95, and from 100 to 122; most or all PAs had eluted by fraction 130. Flavonoids (yellow with all three detection methods) were seen after this point, with the glycosylated versions eluting first (approximately fractions 130 through 210) and the aglycones quercetin (240-252) and myricetin (258-270) eluting last. A number of other interesting compounds eluted in the early fractions, with the proanthocyanidins. TLC detection (confirmed with a standard), as well as later fractionation and detection, indicated that large quantities of benzoic acid eluted in fractions 94 through 108, within the second proanthocyanidin range. Also in this range (detected in fraction 107 by matching MS molecular weight data with known cranberry compounds) were the iridoid 6,7-dihydromonotropein found by Jensen et al. , 65 and the coumaroyl monotropeins described by us (TABLE XIII). A compound with the molecular weight of sinapic acid is also present in this fraction per MS data, and a compound with the triterpenoid molecular weight of \u0001- or \u0002-amyrin eluted immediately prior (fraction 101). A compound with molecular weight corresponding to the known cranberry compound abscisic acid is present in fraction 80, coeluting with the first large group of proanthocyanidins. While the Sephadex LH-20 column did successfully separate proanthocyanidins from flavonoids, and glycosylated from aglycone forms of flavonoids, molecules of other compound classes were not separated from these two major compound classes. A key example is benzoic acid, a very small molecule that coeluted within the second group of 105 APPENDIX D (continued) proanthocyanidins, and, additionally, coeluted with the VM iridoids. Because benzoic acid is bactericidal, it is imperative that other methods of compound separation for cranberry be conducted before fractions are tested for antiadherent biological activity, and this lead us to inserting the HSCCC separation step at level two, before LH-20 fractionation, for the remaining majority of the active VM material.

A biological assay suitable for assessing the antiadherent activity of botanicals, and using biological relevant P-fimbriated E. coli (ATCC E. coli strains 25922, 29194, 49161, 53498, and cells (T24, ATCC HTB-4) was developed to guide fractionation of VM products. Guided fractionation lead to an antiadherent fraction containing new compounds 10- 10- a number of flavonoids prunin and phloridzin. While the entire fraction was antiadherent, compounds tested were not individually active; related compounds may explain the activity of the whole fraction. In addition to a chemical analysis of the above compounds and a description of the antiadherent assay used, this dissertation includes data on urinary metabolite hippuric acid and the related drop in urinary pH seen after ingestion of cranberry juice cocktail. Also presented are the newly characterized compounds in the context of a comprehensive list of the known constituents of VM, SEM images of a Stevens variety sample, and a suitable HPLC method for identification and standardization of cranberry products.
