Both modern medicine and traditional medicine support many of the ancient claims made about essentials oils such as stress reduction. There's a wide variety of essential oils available. Some are valued for their pleasing aroma. Their potency have proven to be of great health benefits. It is in this light that indigenous Ghanaian company Nature's Essentials is leading the charge for a healthy lifestyle providing solutions to numerous health conditions. The company is doing this by using its wide range of Essential oil and organic oil products for healing. Nature's Essentials was founded in 2019 as a small women-owned business focusing the production of sesame oils. According to the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Nature's Essentials Limited, Ekua Takyiwa Dufu, her line of product oils were carefully crafted to create memorable experiences priced affordably for anyone to enjoy. \"With Nature's Essentials edible oils, the company's focus was to introduce and cultivate new ways in how we can traditionally use and relate to oils. For example, to use sesame oils as flavor enhancers in our foods and to benefit from the nutritional value from the oils is the best we could ever do in our daily affairs,\" she said. Inspiration Touching on what inspired her to come out with such products, this is what she had to share. \"With our aromatherapy oils our focus was on well-being and mindfulness by introducing relaxation and a refreshed state of mind throughout the day. Mindfulness was important to us in large recognition for the increased isolated live styles as a result of COVID-19. It was developed in recognition of our innate ability to survive once we are grounded in self-love',\" she said. About the products Our sesame oil products are locally produced and FDA approved all-natural pure plant-based oils. They fall into two main categories: edible oils and topical oils. Sesame Oils (Edible Product line) Edible Oils come in three varieties: Original Sesame Oil using a cold-press technique and the Toasted varieties (Light and Dark) which are Expeller-pressed. Transitioning away from oily foods to oils that serve as flavor enhancers and health oils that contribute to our daily nutritional in-take. Sesame oil is one such healthy oil that provides flavor and enhances the foods we eat. Uses The toasted varieties have a distinctive rich nutty and smoky aroma which serve as a great addition to noodles, stir fry vegetables. For example, I use it when steaming rice and it introduces an excellent fragrance and taste to your food. I also use it in making quick salad dressings which introduce variety to your meals. You can also use it for marinades for your chicken, fish and meats. The original is a milder version cold-pressed variety which retains the full nutritional benefits. Drizzle onto your grilled foods - chicken, meat or fish.
