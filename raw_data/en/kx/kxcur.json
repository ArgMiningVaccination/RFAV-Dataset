In reality, their presence, through telepathy or the radiation of their own aura (the energy they emit) touches the inner being of those who come into contact with them, uplifting the vibrations and the atmosphere around them. Listen to the audio of Trigueirinho about the theme The energy that flows However, the power to render such service is not in the \"person\" that offers to be the instrument, but rather in the energy that flows through them. If they have chosen to seek their own internal vibration, they have taken the first step towards the higher divine force that brings in itself the healing power. It is evident that, in order to make contact with this source and to keep its fluency, one has to take certain precautions. However, healing takes place through the individual not because they have taken any precaution; it happens because they help others, within certain known cosmic laws. In what concerns the healing energy that passes through the hands, these laws can easily be summarized. In a life in which there is no evolutionary preoccupations, the hands of an individual are used to \"grab\" things for them, retaining them for merely selfish aims. They spend long periods acting thus. Even if the act of retaining happens as a mental attitude, and not on the physical plane, their hands have this characteristic: they do not really give, they only take. To the benefit of other It is in another state of human evolution that the hands begin to pick things not only for the individual alone, but to help someone else or to the benefit of a group; these hands, in this more adult stage, immediately liberate what they have picked, passing the gift to another. As the individual evolves, they become increasingly impersonal. They begin to use everything that is necessary for life; however nothing that is superfluous is kept. Their act of using, is different from the normal one: respectful, simple, full of gratitude, without taking advantage of anything and without ever going beyond what is really essential. They use what is needed, but not for themselves; because also this \"themselves\" becomes just an working instrument that must be kept in order, to the benefit of other beings who need help. In this stage, the hands of the individual become transmitters of spiritual energy, that is, of internal evolutionary force. When writing a letter, when wrapping something, when preparing a food, and in any act made with the hands, they convey this energy, which impregnates everything they touch. To seek only the essential. Another stage is reached by their acts and gesture when they begin to seek only the essential. At this point, they can already renounce superfluous things of the physical, emotional and mental plane. The individual becomes capable of passing not only spiritual energy through their hands as in the previous stage, but also to remove obstacles of every kind that can be hindering the progress of the beings whom they are serving.
