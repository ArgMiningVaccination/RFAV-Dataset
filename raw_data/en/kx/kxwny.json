Magnet therapy has been used by more than 100 million people worldwide. Clinical studies show magnet therapy to be an effective treatment for back pain, insomnia, high cholesterol and blood pressure, and many other ailments. The recent discovery of magnetic receptors in the human brain has confirmed what the ancient Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, and Greeks always that human beings are strongly influenced by the Earth's magnetic field, and that by subtly altering our own energy fields with magnets we can restore proper balance to our body systems.
