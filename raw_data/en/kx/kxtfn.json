[Adenoviruses](https://patienteducation.asgct.org/covid19-vaccines/adenovirus-vaccines-for-covid19) have been used in gene therapy and have also been researched for use in vaccines for decades. An adenovirus can be used as a vector, or carrier, to deliver a gene to cells with instructions to make a protein required for the body to function properly. Think of the adenovirus vector as an envelope with a message inside. Headquartered in Moscow, Russia, the [Gamaleya Research Institute](http://www.gamaleya.ru/content/institute/index.htm) of Epidemiology and Microbiology, previously known as the N. F. Gamaleya Federal Research Center for Epidemiology & Microbiology, is a Russian medical research institute. The center was founded in 1891 as a private laboratory. Since 1949 it bears the name of Nikolai Gamaleya, a pioneer in Russian microbiology studies. BVRS-GamVac-Combi Indication BVRS-GamVac-Combi MERS Vaccine is indicated to prevent Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). MERS-CoV is another form of coronavirus and causes an acute lower-respiratory infection in humans, with a fatality rate of ~34.5%. Human-to-human transmission is amplified among household contacts and in healthcare settings, stated the [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers-cov-situation-update). And, scientific evidence suggests that people are infected through direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. MERS-CoV was [first reported](https://www.coronavirustoday.com/mers-vaccines) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012. The outbreak of MERS-CoV in [South Korea](https://www.kjim.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.3904/kjim.2018.031) during 2015 involved 186 cases, including 38 fatalities. From January 2021 to May 31, 2021, nine MERS-CoV cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia (8) and the United Arab Emirates (1), including [five deaths](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers-cov-situation-update).
