But their approach is a bit different than a traditional doctor. Instead of treating the symptoms of your illness with medications like many doctors do, a naturopathic doctor will identify the underlying cause. Once the root cause is determined, they will develop an individualized treatment plan that will promote self-healing. The symptoms of an illness are often treated with medications, but the treatment for healing the disease is neglected. Naturopathic practitioners believe in whole-body healing that removes the obstacles so that you can obtain overall optimal health. Treatment plans will stimulate your bodies' self-healing process, strengthen your immune system, and restore your mind and body's health. Regardless of what type of illness you may suffer from, a naturopathic doctor can help. Here is a list of some of the most common, - Thyroid Conditions - Stress, anxiety - Depression - Gut Health - Pain - Hormone Imbalances - Cardiovascular Health - Chronic Fatigue Getting relief without becoming dependent on medication is the goal through alternative medicine. This will be achieved through various homeopathy, nutritional and herbal supplements. It is excellent for preventative health, as well. Alternative medicine is non-traditional medicine such as naturopathy, homeopathy, acupuncture, and chiropractic care that usually complements traditional medicine. It's not that a naturopath doesn't believe in conventional medication. What they believe is that your body often has the ability to heal when given the right balance. A balance that is often thrown off by lack of nutrition, poor mental health, stress, and environmental toxins. The focus of alternative medicine is the whole-body approach in order to achieve optimal health - your body, diet, and mind. Many of today's chronic diseases stem from nutritional excess and deficiency that is a result of a poor diet that is high in toxins or lacks proper nutrients for your body. Dietary supplements, herbal medicine, and overall diet improvement will help balance your body's nutritional well-being and improve many of the alignments such as bloating, chronic fatigue, depression, and more. This helps your body naturally heal from these health conditions. It will also prevent many health problems, such as cardiovascular heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Your health is affected by more than just the foods you eat; your mental health affects your overall health as well. This is why we focus on healing your whole body to obtain optimal health and fully live your life. If you are looking for relief from health conditions such as hormonal imbalances, infertility, menopause, stress/anxiety, cardiovascular health, or any other health condition. In that case, you may ask a naturopathic doctor for help. If you've tried conventional medicine and you haven't had relief, there is still hope. Cookie-cutter treatments for an illness don't work for everyone; that's why getting an individualized plan for your specific needs is essential. There have been many research studies proving that naturopathic treatments through naturopathic medicine is both safe and effective. You can get started today by scheduling a consultation. Treating you as an individual with a disease will allow us to uncover what caused your symptoms and illness. You'll finally be able to get the treatment that will aid in treating the illness, not just the symptoms. This will allow you to live your life free of the illness without the use of medications that often have many side-effects of their own. Your initial visit will be longer than your conventional medical visit. Most visits last between 90-120 minutes. We want to get to know you! You'll tell your story to the doctor so that he/she can learn more about you and understand how you got to where you are at that moment. Learning about your story is an integral part of the healing process, both physically and mentally. When you tell your story, you are giving insight into the potential triggers of what is causing your symptoms; this could be emotional or physical. Based on your symptoms and your story, the naturopathic doctor will determine which tests should be performed to find the root cause of your underlying condition. The goal is to tailor a treatment plan specifically for your needs, not just the needs of the symptoms. Treating the symptom does nothing for your overall health.
