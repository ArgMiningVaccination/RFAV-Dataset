My friend Carol is one of those recognizable people! She is a nutritionist and owner of [Body Mind & Belly](https://bodymindbelly.com/about-bmb). She holds a Master's of Science in Nutrition from the National University of Natural Medicine, a Bachelor's in Fine Arts from Parson's School of Design and has over 800 hours of advanced yoga and meditation teacher training. This fall she will be pursuing a certificate in Food in Culture and Social Justice from Oregon State University, so that she can put her nutrition skills to use as an advocate for food justice and food policy reform. Body, Mind & Belly takes a radical self-love approach to food, lifestyle and healing. Diet culture can be damaging but understanding and building a healthy relationship with food can be life-changing! Carol's nutrition practice is not just person-centered. It is a safe and welcoming space that comes with the understanding that relationships with food can be complex and all bodies deserve access to nutrition education that is healing for them. Carol says, \"Eating is SO much more than simply consuming food. During each moment of our lives, our brain, nervous system and body are communicating. Deciding what to eat, how to prepare it, when to eat it and understanding how it affects us inside and out takes some effort and is not as simple as it seems. We already contain all that we need to feel centered, strong and self-compassionate in all that we do, including in our relationship with food.\" Why Should You Work With Carol? Personalized nutrition therapy with Carol can \"help you discover the root causes of your concerns from a holistic viewpoint.\" She says, \"We then collaborate on an accessible and sustainable plan, taking steps toward goals that you are ready, willing and able to make. I am here for those wanting to heal their relationship to food or use shifts in nutrition and lifestyle patterns to manage and support specific medical conditions. Some conditions I often work with are chronic stress and inflammation, anxiety and depression, diabetes type I & II, high blood pressure, gut health issues, nutritional deficiencies like iron deficiency anemia and high cholesterol.\" Understanding that people come from different backgrounds and cultures, Carol points out that, \"one of the main pillars of my approach is inclusivity, because the environment in which we do this work really matters. LGBTQIA2S+, POC and veterans often experience barriers to receiving respectful, culturally sensitive and appropriate care in typical healthcare settings. The interplay and health of your environment, your body, microbiome, mind and spirit are unique to you, and you deserve care that reflects that. I will never just hand you a stack of paper with nutrition information about your medical conditions and tell you to get to work, because we all know that that isn't how we find positive and lasting change.\" When Asked About Chinese Medicine, Carol Says... \"I love that acupuncture is relatively non-invasive, yet it can it can help DRASTICALLY in such a minimal amount of time. There have been times when I've walked into an appointment with a stiff pain in my neck, not able to turn my head more than a few degrees to either side and have walked out 30 or so minutes later feeling at least 75% less pain. I also respect and appreciate the holistic system of Chinese medicine which considers all parts, including nutrition, herb and lifestyle approaches. I can go see an acupuncturist about something physical, energetic, mental (or all!) and be treated for such a wide variety of concerns, and perhaps gain an understanding in some way of how they may all be connected. This concept is not one we are often exposed to in the US and I hope that Chinese Medicine, along with systems like Ayurveda, yoga and even holistic nutrition can continue to broaden our perspectives of health and healthcare.\"I love how relaxed I feel after an acupuncture appointment and how much of a difference it makes physically and energetically. I've gone to acupuncture for anxiety relief and relaxation, but also for physical strains and pains. I'm amazed that I can walk into the appointment with a stiff neck and barely able to turn my head, and in less than an hour feel SO much more mobile and free! Acupuncture works!\" Carol currently receives acupuncture at [Silver Lining Acupuncture](https://www.silverliningacupuncture.com/) in Portland, Oregon.
