We look forward to working with you! Quantum physics has proven that at our most fundamental level we live in a sea of infinite energy and information. If you think about it, our bodies, minds and spirits are also in-formed by fields or layers of energy and information. The Chinese knew this fact thousands of years ago as they meticulously observed the functioning of the heavens, man and earth. As they did so, the Chinese went about mapping the body's energy (qi) points (acupuncture points) and energy pathways (meridians). Over time they developed a comprehensive system of medicine that has withstood the test of time. Today acupuncture offers a safe, effective treatment for a variety of conditions by restoring the energetic balance or harmony within us. It is a total mind, body, spirit approach to wellness. While acupuncture is well known for its ability to control pain, it is also very effective for treating a variety of other ailments. The National Institute of Health (NIH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have recognized the efficacy of acupuncture for conditions such as: addictions, anxiety, arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, chronic fatigue, colitis, common cold, constipation, dental pain, depression, diarrhea, digestive trouble, dizziness, dysentery, emotional problems, eye problems, facial palsy/tics, fatigue, fertility, fibromyalgia, gingivitis, headache, hiccups, incontinence, indigestion, irritable bowel syndrome, low back pain, menopause, menstrual irregularities, migraine, morning sickness, nausea, osteoarthritis, pain, pms, pneumonia, reproductive problems, rhinitis, sciatica, seasonal affective disorder, shoulder pain, sinusitis, sleep disturbances, smoking cessation, sore throat, stress, tennis elbow, tonsillitis, tooth pain, trigeminal neuralgia, urinary tract infections, vomiting and wrist pain. But truly the list does not end here. You are invited to explore the health-giving benefits of acupuncture for yourself at Healing Touch Chiropractic and Acupuncture.

The spine is the gateway to the nervous system and the nervous system controls and coordinates all the other systems of the body. When the spine is not aligned properly, the nerve flow to and from the brain, (whether it is through over-irritated and overactive signaling or through the blockage of nerve flow), cannot send the proper information to the brain and/or the proper signals out to the periphery for your system to respond appropriately to the ever-changing environment inside and outside the body. For example, when it is cold outside, it is nerve receptors on the skin that pick up that information and send it to the brain. The brain then takes that information integrates it and then sends the appropriate signals out to shiver to conserve heat. So as you can see, the body's \"response-ability\" to changes in its environment is mediated directly by the nervous system. Thus, on a physiological level it is the nervous system that orchestrates healing and homeostasis (a functional dynamic balance) in the body. This brings about health and wellness and an increased quality of life. Most people think that chiropractic care is just for back pain, neck pain and headaches. While many studies have shown that it is very effective at treating such complaints, chiropractic treatment, by maintaining a healthy spine and proper nerve flow, truly enhances the functioning of the entire body. Many people with a wide range of ailments such as allergies, asthma, digestive problems, diabetes, ear infections and menstrual complaints have found relief with chiropractic care. Others have sought chiropractic treatment for more restful sleep, better concentration, increased immunity, and peak physical and mental performance.
