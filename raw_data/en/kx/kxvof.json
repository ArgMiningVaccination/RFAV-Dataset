Providing for the primary medical needs of an ill or injured animal is paramount, but the return to normal and healthy function does not always follow. There are times when your pet needs assistance to regain much of their previous function that was present before illness, prolonged disability, or surgery. Integrative medicine is a comprehensive approach to healing that combines the best of traditional medicine with complementary and alternative therapies such as physical rehabilitation. This type of veterinary care provided by highly trained practitioners, focuses on treating the whole animal, in partnership with the client, the medical team, and appropriate therapeutic options to comfortably speed recovery, reduce pain, and achieve the best possible outcome Appointment Information We partner with your family veterinarian, specialists appointments are by referral only. Integrative Medicine appointments are booked Monday to Friday. A deposit of $205 is required upon scheduling. After the initial evaluation, treatments can be booked Monday to Saturday. Hours vary week by week. What to Expect During Treatment & Therapy in Crystal Lake In partnership with our primary veterinarian, our experienced therapy and rehabilitation team can create a comprehensive custom treatment program for your pet that is tailored to their unique needs. Therapy may include a combination of techniques, exercises, and more. We will determine the best therapies based on your pet's condition, capabilities, and specific requirements. Treatment & Therapy Options A customized physical rehabilitation program can consist of several therapeutic techniques, including: [Therapeutic Physical Exercise](#) Therapeutic physical exercise is the cornerstone of any great physical rehabilitation program. Several exercises are appropriate for a plethora of conditions and offer many benefits for your pet. With targeted physical exercises, we can: - Improve cartilage and ligament health - Improve muscle mass and strength - Prevent or reverse osteoporosis - Increase circulation - Decrease pain - Reduce obesity - Improve function and mobility - Improve flexibility and range of motion - Improve balance and senses - Increase endurance and stamina [Hydrotherapy](#) Low-impact aquatic therapy can help improve strength, range of motion, and endurance. The buoyancy properties of water minimize weight-bearing stress on the joints, which helps prevent tissue injuries, inflammation, and pain. Aquatic therapy is appropriate for: - Post-operative orthopedic procedures - Neurological conditions - Osteoarthritis patients - Overweight patients We conduct hydrotherapy at our hospital using an underwater treadmill. The underwater treadmill promotes controlled weight-bearing by varying water levels. [Manual Techniques](#) Manual techniques refer to massage, passive range of motion, stretches, and joint mobilization. These are all important components of any rehabilitation program and can help alleviate pain, increase circulation, promote relaxation and improve tissue extensibility. [Cold Laser Therapy](#) Cold (low-level) laser is a drug-free, non-invasive therapy frequently used with rehab patients to increase the quality, speed, and tensile strength of tissue repair. It is also helpful for reducing pain and inflammation. This safe, effective and precise therapy is used to treat several conditions such as soft tissue injuries, post-operative conditions, arthritis, and wounds. [Therapeutic Ultrasound](#) Therapeutic ultrasound can improve your pet's mobility and promote soft tissue health. It reduces scar tissue and enhances repair to the bone structure by providing thermal and non-thermal mechanical stimulation. This promotes the healing of tissue (muscles, tendons, joint capsules, ligaments) and bones. During the ultrasound, a pulsed or continuous sound wave can be applied using varied heads to determine the depth of sound wave penetration. Depending on the tissue and condition, the intensity of the treatment may also be adjusted. Several conditions respond well to this treatment, including: - Muscle contracture - Muscle strains - Spasms - Tendonitis - Calcified tendons - Fracture healing - Ligament sprains - Chronic synovitis [Weight Loss Programs](#) In some situations, your pet's chronic ailments may be alleviated by losing weight. Among other things, excess weight can cause increased joint stress, heighten the risk of heart disease, and make your pet more susceptible to conditions such as diabetes. Our integrated medicine team can work with you to create a weight loss program for your pet to help bring them back to an optimal healthy weight. Our programs may include things such as exercise recommendations and diet changes to help get your pet back on track. [Acupuncture](#) Acupuncture is a 6,000-year-old therapy used to alleviate in conjunction with other treatments to alleviate pain throughout the body. Acupuncture is a technique that involves the insertion of fine needles into an animal's body at specific points called meridians, where the blood vessels and nerves converge. The needles assist in channeling vital energy along these meridians, thereby supporting the nervous system, promoting circulation, and enhancing the body's natural healing abilities. [Electrical Stimulation](#) Using a microcurrent electrical neuromuscular stimulator, we use a very specific, small wavelength of electricity to treat pain and slow macular degeneration. This type of therapy has a cumulative effect, and studies have shown that many patients feel that pain is alleviated long-term with regular treatments. Electrical stimulation can be used to treat pain disorders, neurological dysfunction, sprains, spasms and strains, and post-operative pain and scars. [Spinal Manipulative Therapy (Chiropractic)](#) Chiropractic care is most commonly administered as an additional treatment option for animals experiencing spinal problems or biomechanical-related musculoskeletal disorders. During a veterinary chiropractic treatment session, your pet will typically undergo spinal manipulation or manual therapy to shift misplaced vertebrae in the spine (also referred to as vertebral subluxations) back to their natural positions to release pressure on surrounding nerve tissue. In turn, this may help to relieve pain throughout the body and allow it to heal itself naturally.
