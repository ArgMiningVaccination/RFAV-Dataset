This takes his doctoral qualifications to three. He holds other doctorates in Naturopathy and Holistic Medicine and several other certifications to his credit. His Doctor of Theology thesis examined the impact of prayer as a complementary and alternative medicine, and found that prayer can be incorporated into healthcare as a complementary therapy to improve the quality of life of patients. Prof. Nyarkotey believes that there are instances where using prayer as a stand-alone in healing could be suicidal to patients. He notes that prayer works, and has witnessed an instance where medical sciences failed and prayer was the tool. He notes that his interest in prayer as a mind-body therapy stems from his church, Holy Ghost Temple, Adenta-Fafraha, where the sick people get their healing through the Prophet. He believes that there is a role in Christian prayer in healthcare and it could be incorporated. Some hospitals could have a unit for church services - such as a hospital chaplain to provide spiritual support to the sick. \"Health is holistic, and sometimes goes beyond the physical,\" he said. His thesis also reviews several aspects of Christian activities, such as fasting, worship, tithes and offerings, resurrections, and their impacts on the Christians. Prof. Nyarkotey Obu, who is currently admitted at the Gambia Law School, Banjul to pursue the Barrister-At-Law course, is also the President of the Nyarkotey College of Holistic Medicine, championing the practice of Naturopathy and Holistic Medicine.
