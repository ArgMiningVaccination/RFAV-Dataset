This manual will provide you with important informationabout your care as you andyour family prepare fordischarge from the hospital. This may have been a challenging time foryou and your family as you endured thesymptoms and complications of your liverdisease, waited for a suitable organ, andfinally received your transplant. As you arelearning by now, liver transplantation is farmore than the operation you recentlyexperienced. Now that you are recovering,it is important for you to learn about yourcare so that you will have the best possibleoutcome with your healthy liver. You arethe most important member of the transplantteam and active participation in your carewill lead to your successful recovery. Having a liver transplant has given you a second chance at a healthier, more activelife, but also brings new and importantresponsibilities for your care. Purpose This handbook is intended to provide informationabout life after liver transplantation. Itincludes information about common healthcareroutines, medications, clinic visits, monitoringguidelines, activities of daily living, signsand symptoms of possible complications,and how to contact your healthcare team. This handbook is designed as a general reference for care after liver transplantation.Transplant centers often have different care routines, monitoring guidelines, andimmunosuppressive routines following livertransplant, so it is always very important tocheck with your transplant coordinatorwhen you have questions or concerns aboutany aspect of your care. It is important toreview this handbook with your nurse,transplant coordinator, or clinical nursespecialist to understand your center's specificguidelines. Your center's specific guidelines should always be followed. Your Responsibilities As the most important caretaker of the transplanted liver, you will need to: Know all your medications: Why am I taking this medication? What is my dose? When should I take this medicine? What are the side effects of my medicines? Are there any special instructions for my medicines? Follow your medication schedule daily and make changes only as ordered by your physician. 3 Liver Handbook Maintain routine contact with your transplant team through your transplantcoordinator. My transplant coordinator is: Attend follow-up appointments and/or transplant clinic as instructed. My first clinic appointment is: ________________________________ Clinic is located at: ________________________________ My appointment time is: ________________________________ Have blood tests drawn as required. I need to have my blood tests drawn every: ________________________________ I will get my blood tests drawn at: ________________________________ Any special instructions: ________________________________________________________________________________________________ Monitor your weight, blood pressure, and temperature as required. My discharge weight is: ________________________________ My normal blood pressure is: ________________________________ I should call my coordinator if my temperature is > _________ or if my blood pressure is > ______________. Maintain a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, androutine check-ups.Your Transplant Team As you have progressed through the transplant process, you have becomeacquainted with many members of thetransplant team. After transplant, it isimportant that you maintain regular contactwith the team. They will continue to provideadvice and support for you and your family.Team members usually include: Transplant Surgeon Transplant surgeons are medical doctors who specialize in liver surgery andtransplantation. The surgeons perform theoperation and will be involved in your careand medical management as you recoverfrom surgery. My transplant surgeon(s): ________________________________ 4 Liver Handbook Hepatologist Ahepatologist is a medical doctor who specializes in medical problems of the liver.You may have seen a hepatologist before your transplant. My hepatologist: ________________________________ Management varies by transplant center, so you may have follow-up care with yourtransplant physician, transplant surgeon, orhepatologist. They will be responsible forthe management of anti-rejection medicationsand any medical issues directly related tothe transplant. For health problems notrelated to your liver transplant, you shouldcontinue to contact your local physician orgeneral practitioner. Your transplant coordinatorwill help you plan your follow-up care afteryou leave the transplant center. Transplant Coordinator (RN, CCTC) Transplant coordinators, usually licensed registered nurses (RN), have extensiveexperience in the care and management oftransplant recipients, both before and aftertransplant. Your coordinator will beinvolved in preparing you for discharge aswell as your long-term outpatient care.Your coordinator may refer you to other team members for services that you needand will be available to discuss anyquestions or concerns you may have as youbegin to adapt to life following yourtransplant. If you notice the initials CCTCafter your coordinator's name it means thathe or she is a Certified TransplantCoordinator. My coordinator: ________________________________ Phone: __________________________Social Worker (MSW) Atransplant social worker specializes in helping patients and families cope with thestresses and challenges of the transplantprocess. Your social worker may help youby identifying community supports, assistingyou with housing while staying in thehospital community, helping with financialdifficulties, providing emotional support,and providing information and referrals forsupport groups or counseling. My social worker: ________________________________ Phone: __________________________ Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) Aclinical nurse specialist is a registered nurse with an advanced practice degree in anursing specialty. The transplant clinicalnurse specialist is usually involved in thetransplant evaluation as well aspost-transplant care and will provideinformation on all facets of the transplantprocess, assess any potential problems,provide supportive care, and will helpprepare you for discharge. This nurse maybe involved with your care while you are inthe hospital and after discharge. My CNS: Transplant Team Liver a licensed medical professional who dispenses prescriptionmedications. As part of the transplant team,the transplant pharmacist may help monitoryour medications while you are in the hospitaland at clinic visits. The pharmacist may alsobe involved in your discharge teaching and willprovide information about your medicationsand instructions on how to take them. My pharmacy: ________________________________ Phone: ________________________________ Dietician Adietician specializes in aspects of diet and nutrition. As part of the transplant team, yourdietician will help manage your nutritionbefore and after transplant. The dieticianmay also work with you on any specialdietary instructions or diets for medicalcomplications such as diabetes, high bloodpressure, high potassium levels, or highcholesterol. My dietician: ________________________________ Phone: ________________________________Medications One of the most important responsibilities you will have after transplant is taking yourmedications as they are prescribed. Youwill learn about your medications beforeyou leave the hospital, but you shouldcontact your transplant coordinator if youhave any further questions or concerns. Asyou learn about your medications, be surethat you know and understand the followingfor each medication: The brand name and generic name Medications are known by two different names. The brand name is the name givento the medication by the pharmaceuticalcompany that produces it. The genericname is the common, non-branded name ofthat medication. There can be several brandnames for a generic medication. The purpose or reason for taking each medication Amedication often has more than one use and may be prescribed for different reasons.You should always know why you are taking each medication. What each medication looks like It is important that you are able to recognize each medication by color, shape, and size.Many medications have a similar appearancewith only slight differences and must belooked at closely to be sure the correctmedication is being taken. 6 Liver Handbook When to take each medication Some medications, such as the anti-rejection medications Prograf\u00ae(tacrolimus) or Neoral\u00ae (cyclosporine) must be taken on time dailyso that the level of medication in yourblood stays stable to help prevent rejection.It is important to know what time you takeeach medication. W ork with your coordinator or nurse to arrange amedication schedule that is easy to followwith your daily routine. How to take each medication You probably take most of your medications by swallowing a pill or capsule. Occasionally,particularly for children, a pill may bedivided or crushed and mixed with food orliquids. Discuss how to take each of yourmedications with your nurse or coordinator. How long each medication is prescribed Some medications may be prescribed only for 7-14 days, such as antibiotics. Others,like your anti-rejection medications, areusually prescribed for your lifetime. Some medications can be discontinued after a complication or side effect hasresolved. The most common side effects Every medication has side effects, but these are not experienced by everyone. Youshould know the most common side effectsthat each medication may cause and whatwill be done to relieve that side effect. Any special instructions Some medications must be taken with food or on an empty stomach, or separated fromcertain meds. Discuss any specialinstructions for your medications with yournurse, pharmacist, or coordinator. What to do if you are late, miss a dose, or forget to take a dose If you are very late taking a medication orhave skipped a dose, either because youforgot or you have been vomiting, call yourtransplant coordinator. After asking you afew questions and considering your currenthealth status, your coordinator will adviseyou on what to do. How to order your medications Your transplant coordinator, nurse, or social worker will help you find the mostconvenient way to order your medications.Be sure that you have all your prescriptionsbefore you leave the hospital. 7Medications Liver Handbook When to order your refills/repeat prescriptions The number of refills you have for eachmedication depends on how long you willbe taking the medication, as well as whatyour insurance coverage will allow. Oncethe prescription has been submitted to yourpharmacy, you may call for refills/repeatprescriptions. However, all new prescriptionsand any changes in the meds you arealready taking must be called in or sent toyour pharmacy by your physician. It isvery important to monitor the number ofpills you have so you can order your refillsin time or call your coordinator to do this sothat you avoid missing any doses. Youshould always have a 1-2 week supply. What is my cost for my medications? It is also important that you know your financial responsibility for your medicationsso you can plan ahead. In the US, somemedications may be completely covered byinsurance, while others have co-pays. Often,insurance companies have a deductible youmust meet until their coverage begins. Itmay be helpful for you or a family memberto call your case manager or approvedpharmacy provider before your medicationsare ordered. A toll-free number for\"prescriptive authorization\" is usually onthe back of insurance cards. This contactperson should be able to tell you what yourcost is for each prescribed medication. Internationally, medication costs vary from country to country. You should discuss thepossible cost of your prescriptions withyour transplant coordinator.Medication Guidelines Medications should be taken daily, always as prescribed. Taking your medications correctlyand following your medication scheduledaily will help you achieve a healthy, activelife as a transplant recipient. Liver rejectioncan occur at any time as a result of misseddoses of anti-rejection medications. Call your coordinator if you: are unable to take you medications because you are nauseated, feeling sick, or vomiting have diarrhea and are worried that you are not absorbing your medications have forgotten to take your medication or missed any doses due to illness think that the directions on the medication label from the pharmacy are different thanwhat you were told feel you are having an unusual reaction or side effects to a medication want to take Tylenol \u00ae(acetaminophen) or Advil\u00ae(ibuprofen) for fever (see Fever, page 24 ) want to take an over-the-counter cold remedy, cough suppressant, diet aid, herbalmedicine, or medication that you have notpreviously discussed with your doctor are ordered any new medications by your local physician or if any changes are madeto your current medications by another physician. 8MedicationsLiver Handbook Organize a medication schedule that fits well with your daily routine.Work with your transplant coordinator, nurse, or pharmacist to arrange a schedulethat fits into your daily routine so thattaking medications is most convenient for you. A comfortable schedule will improveyour success for taking all your meds at the right time every day. Some people find it helpful to follow a written schedule or a check-off list. Pill reminder containers and medication alarmsmay also be helpful. Pill containers can be stocked with a week's supply ofmedications. Medication alarms are also available and can be set to remind you to take your medications on time. Always keep a copy of your medication schedule with you. If you are seen in clinic, your doctor's office, or in anemergency room, it will help to have a current list of your medications available. It is difficult for some people to take medicines that are prescribed three or fourtimes a day. If this is a problem for you, talk to your doctor about the possibility ofchanging the dosage so that it may be taken less frequently. Unfortunately, dosages can not always be changed.Storing your medications Keep medications in the original containers with the caps closed. If you use a pill reminder container, keep the container sealed. It is important that you can recognize different medications when theyare together in a pill container in case a dose has changed. Store your meds in a cool, dry place away from sunlight. Do not store meds in the bathroom since moisture may interfere with the medication's effectiveness. Do not store meds in a refrigerator unless instructed to do so by your pharmacist. Keep all medications in a safe place, out of reach of children. It may be helpful to keep a few doses of your medications in another place, aside from your household. Sometimes transplantrecipients will store extra doses of anti-rejection medications at a family member's house or in their office in case of an emergency. It may be helpful to bring your medications, filled med container and/or medication list with you for clinic visits or if you are admitted to the hospital. Thiswill insure that you won't miss any doses. 9Medication Guidlines Liver Handbook Commonly Prescribed Medications Following Liver Transplantation Anti-Rejection Medications Tacrolimus (Prograf\u00ae) Purpose: Tacrolimus is used to prevent or treat rejection after liver transplant. Itprevents rejection by inhibiting certain cellsin the immune system. Tacrolimus may bethe only immunosuppressant medicationprescribed for you, but some transplantpatients take tacrolimus as well as one or twoother available in 0.5 mg (yellow), 1 mg (white), and 5 mg (pink)capsules. It is usually dosed twice dailyand doses should be taken 12 hours apart.Tacrolimus should be taken on time every day to insure a stable level of immunosuppression. Side effects: The side effects of tacrolimus vary and are usually related to the bloodlevel of the drug. The most common sideeffects are: Nervous system side effects (neurotoxicities): These side effects are more commonly seenwith a high tacrolimus level (>15 ng/ml)andusually resolve as the level is decreased. High tacrolimus levels may cause headache,insomnia (trouble sleeping), numbness andtingling of the hands and feet, hand tremors,or an increased sensitivity to bright orblinking lights. Aphasia (difficulty speaking)and seizures are very rare side effects, buthave occurred with very high levels. Kidney dysfunction (nephrotoxicities): Tacrolimus can affect the kidneys by causing tiny arteries, called arterioles, to get smalleror constrict. When this happens, high bloodpressure, high potassium levels, lowmagnesium levels, and/or abnormal kidneyfunction tests may occur. 10 The information about these medications is presented as an overview that includes thepurpose of each medication, the usual dosageand dosage forms, the most common side effects, and other significant information. This information is meant to be a generalguide for the liver transplant recipient andis not all-inclusive. Always contact yourtransplant coordinator or your transplant teamto be aware of your center's recommendationsand specific medication protocols.Some medications may be harmful if you are pregnant. If you are pregnant or planningto become pregnant, your transplant physicianand obstetrician/gynecologist should beconsulted to discuss your medication history,stop any meds that may be harmful, and/orto readjust your immunosuppression, ifnecessary. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding,contact your physician before any newmedications are started or to discuss yourcurrently prescribed medications.Liver Handbook Infection: Your immune system is suppressed so that your transplanted liver is not easilyrejected by your body. Because your body'snatural ability to fight infections hasdecreased, you may be more likely to getinfections. You are at greatest risk fordeveloping infections when your tacrolimuslevel is high, usually during the first threemonths after transplant or if you are beingtreated for rejection with higher doses oftacrolimus. Other side effects that may be experienced with tacrolimus are nausea, diarrhea, highblood sugar, and hair loss. Additional information: Do not change the dose of tacrolimus or take it more or less often than prescribed for you by your transplant physician. Tacrolimus levels are monitored through blood tests. Levels are monitored daily in the early postoperative period, then lessfrequently over time. Most patients have a tacrolimus level checked monthly by thetime they are several months post-transplant.Levels may range from 15 -18 ng/ml in the early post-operative period or during treatment for rejection, but may decrease to 5-10 ng/ml after 1-2 years. Your tacrolimus level should be drawn 1-2 hours before taking a dose, or about 10-12hours after the previous dose. This is called a trough (lowest point) level. When you have your blood work done, donot take your tacrolimus, but bring a dose with you to take after your labs have beendrawn. Your tacrolimus dose may be increased during an episode of rejection or to preventrejection. The dose may be decreased if you have an infection or if you have problems with side effects of the drug. Food can affect the tacrolimus level and may lower it by as much as 30%. Some transplant centers prefer that patients not eat for an hour before or after taking tacrolimus. Please check with you coordinator or transplant pharmacist for your center's guidelines. A light breakfastor meal appears to have no effect on tacrolimus absorption. It is important to be consistent in the way and time you take tacrolimus daily to maintain a stable level. You should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice when prescribed tacrolimus. An ingredient in grapefruit can decrease the metabolism (breakdown)of tacrolimus, causing a higher level. Do not take tacrolimus within 2 hours of taking any antacids such as Carafate \u00ae, Mylanta\u00ae, or Tums\u00ae. from sodium bicarbonate. Tacrolimus interacts with some other medications, causing higher or lower levels.Always check with your transplant coordinator before starting any new medication to be sure that it does not interfere with tacrolimus. If you miss a dose of tacrolimus, take it as soon as you remember. If it is near the time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your regular dosing schedule. Call your transplant coordinatorif you have missed a dose as your levels may need to be monitored more frequently. Store tacrolimus capsules at room temperature. If you are planning to become pregnant, discuss the use of tacrolimus with your transplant physician and obstetrician/gynecologist. 11Prescribed Medications Liver Handbook Cyclosporine (Sandimmune\u00ae, Neoral\u00ae) Purpose: Cyclosporine is used to prevent or treat rejection after transplant. It preventsrejection by inhibiting certain cells in theimmune system. Cyclosporine may be theonly immunosuppressant that is prescribedfor you, but it is often prescribed to be taken with steroids as Neoral (grey capsules) and Sandimmune(pink capsules) in 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100mg capsules. Neoral and Sandimmune aredifferent forms of cyclosporine and yourbody absorbs them differently. Be sure thatyour pharmacy always gives you the brand ofcyclosporine that has been prescribed for you. Cyclosporine is also available as a liquid (100 mg cyclosporine/ 1 ml). You may findthat the liquid form of cyclosporine tastes better if diluted with milk, chocolate milk, or orange juice. Mix cyclosporine and aroom-temperature liquid in a glass or cupand stir it with a metal spoon. Styrofoamcups and plastic are porous and should notbe used since some cyclosporine couldcling to the foam container or plastic. Cyclosporine is usually dosed once or twice daily and should be taken at the same timeeach day to insure a stable level ofimmunosuppression. Side effects: The side effects of cyclosporine vary and are usually related to the level ofthe drug. The most common side effects are: Nervous system side effects (neurotoxicities): These side effects are more commonly seenwith a high level and usually resolve as thelevel is lowered. High levels of cyclosporinemay cause headache, hand tremors, troublesleeping (insomnia), numbness and tinglingof the hands and feet, or an increasedsensitivity to bright or blinking lights. Kidney dysfunction (nephrotoxicities): Cyclosporine can affect the kidneys bycausing tiny arteries, called arterioles, to getsmaller or constrict. When this happens,patients sometimes have high blood pressure,high potassium levels, low magnesiumlevels, and/or abnormal kidney function tests. Infection: Your immune system is suppressed so that your transplanted liver isnot easily rejected by your body. Becauseyour body's natural ability to fight infectionshas decreased, you may be more likely toget infections. You are most at risk fordeveloping infections when yourcyclosporine level is high, during the firstthree months after transplant, and if you aretreated for rejection with higher doses. Other side effects of cyclosporine include: a high cholesterol level in the blood,excessive hair growth, and swelling orovergrowth of the gums. Additional information: Do not change the dose of cyclosporine or take it more or less often than prescribed for you by your transplant physician. 12Prescribed Medications Liver Handbook Cyclosporine levels are monitored with your routine labs. Levels are monitored daily early after transplant, then lessfrequently over time. Most patients have a cyclosporine level checked monthly or every other month by the time they are several months post-transplant. Levels are usually lowered slowly over time if liver function tests are normal. Your cyclosporine level should be drawn 1-2 hours before taking a dose, or about 10-12 hours after the previous dose. This is called a trough (lowest point) level. Whenyou have your blood work done, do not take your cyclosporine, but bring a dose with you to take after your labs have been drawn. Your cyclosporine dose may be increased during an episode of rejection or to preventrejection. The dose may be decreased if you have an infection or if you haveproblems with side effects of the drug. It is important to be consistent in the way and time you take your cyclosporine each day to maintain a stable level. Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice when taking cyclosporine. An ingredient in grapefruit can decrease the breakdown of cyclosporine, causinghigher levels. Cyclosporine interacts with some other medications, causing higher or lower levels.Always check with your transplant coordinatorbefore starting any new medication. If you miss a dose of cyclosporine, take it as soon as you remember. If it is near the time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your regular dosing schedule. Call your transplant coordinatorif you have missed a dose. Levels may need to be monitored more frequently until the cyclosporine level is stabilized.Cyclosporine capsules and liquid should be stored at room temperature away from direct sunlight. An opened bottle of cyclosporine may be used for up to 2 months. If you are planning to become pregnant, discuss the use of cyclosporine with your transplant physician and obstetrician/gynecologist. Prednisone/Prednisolone(Deltasone \u00ae) Purpose: Prednisone is a steroid used to help prevent or treat rejection in livertransplantation. It prevents rejection byinhibiting certain cells in the immunesystem and is often given with tacrolimus(Prograf \u00ae) or cyclosporine (Neoral\u00ae). Although some patients require prednisonefor life, many transplant recipients are beingweaned from steroids within weeks to a fewmonths after transplant. Dosage: Prednisone/Prednisolone is available in several strengths including2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg tablets. Itis also available in a liquid form. Prednisoneis usually prescribed once daily, but ifprescribed twice daily, doses should betaken about 10-12 hours apart. Side effects: Prednisone can have many side effects, but these vary depending onthe dose, frequency and duration of yourtreatment. The most common side effectsinclude: an increased appetite leading toweight gain, stomach irritation and/or 13Prescribed Medications Liver Handbook stomach ulcers, mood changes, irritability, anxiety, and acne. You may also retainfluids which may make your face, hands,and ankles \"puffy\". Side effects that canadditionally occur with higher dosages overa longer period of time include: bruising,high blood pressure, high cholesterol levelsin the blood, high blood sugar, muscleweakness, night sweats, osteoporosis (boneweakening), delayed wound healing, growthretardation (in children), vision problemsdue to cataracts, and glaucoma. Additional information: Do not change the dose of prednisone/ prednisolone or take it more or less often than prescribed. If prescribed once a day, prednisone/ prednisolone should be taken in the morning to avoid insomnia (trouble sleeping). If prednisone/prednisolone is to be stopped, the dose must be decreased slowly over several weeks. Stopping prednisone completely may cause serious complications. Since prednisone/prednisolone may cause stomach upset, it is best to take it with meals. If you miss a dose of prednisone/ prednisolone, take it as soon as you remember. If it is near the time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your regular dosing schedule. Call your transplant coordinator if you have missed a dose. Since your own body's production of a natural steroid (cortisol) is disturbed when you takeprednisone/prednisolone, missing doses ofprednisone could make you sick. If you are taking prednisone/prednisolone, examine your skin routinely for bruising. If you have any wounds that don't seem to be healing well, notify your transplant coordinator. Maintain good care of your skin. Your physician may advise you to avoid concentrated sweets, like candy bars and soda, while taking prednisone/prednisolone.High blood sugar can develop with higherdoses of steroids. Patients who already have diabetes may find it more difficult tocontrol their blood sugar. If you develop a stomach ulcer from prednisone/prednisolone, you may have an upset stomach or abdominal pain. Sometimes ulcers can cause bleeding which will make your stools look black and tarry. Call your transplant coordinatorwith any of these symptoms so medicationsand treatment can be prescribed promptly. Sirolimus (Rapamune\u00ae) Purpose: Sirolimus is used to prevent rejection in organ transplant recipients. Itprevents rejection by inhibiting certain cellsof the immune system. Sirolimus may bethe only immunosuppressant that isprescribed for you, but in many cases,sirolimus is prescribed to be taken with tacrolimus (Prograf \u00ae) or cyclosporine (Neoral\u00ae). Dosage: Sirolimus is available in 1 mg tablets and in a 1 mg/ml liquid. It is usuallytaken once or twice daily and should betaken on time to insure a stable level ofimmunosuppression. The liquid form ofsirolimus should be mixed with 1-2 oz. ofwater or orange juice in a glass or cup. Donot use a styrofoam container since it mayabsorb some of the medication. The tabletshould be swallowed whole and nevercrushed or broken.Prescribed Medications 14Liver Handbook Side effects: The side effects of sirolimus vary and are usually related to the level ofthe drug. The most common side effectsare: an increased risk of infection, nausea,diarrhea, anemia (low blood count), highcholesterol and/or triglyceride levels in theblood, a low white blood cell count,headache, acne, arthritis, and musclecramping. Side effects usually resolve asthe dose is reduced. Additional information: Do not change the dose of sirolimus or take it more or less often than prescribed for you by your transplant physician. Check with you transplant coordinator or pharmacist about the correct time to take your dose of sirolimus. Since sirolimus works with tacrolimus and cyclosporine, some centers prefer that sirolimus be taken about 4 hours from these medicationswhile others recommend taking themedications at the same time. Sirolimus is usually not started immediately after transplant like other anti-rejections medications. It may be prescribed for youat 6-8 weeks after transplant. Your dose of sirolimus may be increased during an episode of rejection. The dose may be decreased if you have an infectionor if you have problems with side effects of the drug. If you miss a dose of sirolimus, take it as soon as you remember. If it is near the time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your regular dosing schedule. Call your transplant coordinatorif you have missed a dose. S irolimus tablets should be swallowed whole without crushing or breaking. The medication is coated on the outside of the pill, so breaking or crushing can result in losing some of the drug.If you take the liquid form of sirolimus, mix your dose in 1-2 oz. of orange juice or water in a glass or cup, avoiding styrofoam. Rinse the container with another ounce of water or orange juice and swallow that amount as well. You may want to additionally rinse your mouth with more water or orange juice. Some patients have developed mouth ulcers from the liquid form. These ulcers have resolved over time with decreased dosing. Store sirolimus tablets at room temperature. The liquid must be refrigerated. If you are planning to become pregnant, please discuss the use of sirolimus with your transplant physician andobstetrician/gynecologist. Azathioprine (Imuran\u00ae) Purpose: Azathioprine is used to help prevent or treat rejection in organ transplantrecipients. Azathioprine is Dose: Azathioprine is available as a 50 mg tablet. It is usually prescribed once dailyand should be given at about the same timeeach day. Side effects: Azathioprine may lower the number of white blood cells in your body,the cells that fight infection. It may alsolower your platelets, which are cells thathelp your blood clot. Other side effectsmay include nausea, vomiting, and rash.Azathioprine may also cause an increase inthe liver functions tests (LFTs). Prescribed Medications 15Liver Handbook Additional information: Do not change the dose of azathioprine or give it more or less often than prescribed. Your dose of azathioprine may be increased during an episode of rejection. The dose may be decreased if you have aninfection or if you have problems with side effects of the drug. If you miss a dose of azathioprine, take it as soon as you remember. If it is near the time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your regular dosing schedule. Call your transplant coordinatorif you have missed a dose. Azathioprine may be discontinued after several months if you have not had any rejection and your liver is working well. You may only need one medication to control rejection by this time. Azathioprine interacts with a medication called Allopurinol, a drug used to treat gout. Call your transplant coordinator if you are diagnosed with gout or if aphysician, other than your transplant doctor, has prescribed this medication for you. If you are planning to become pregnant, discuss the use of azathioprine with your transplant physician and obstetrician-gynecologist. Mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept \u00ae) Purpose: Mycophenolate is used to help prevent or treat rejection in organ transplantrecipients. It is usually given withtacrolimus (Prograf \u00ae), cyclosporine (Neoral\u00ae), and/or prednisone.Dose: Mycophenolate is available in 250 mg and 500 mg capsules. It is usuallyprescribed once or twice daily (3-4 timesdaily in some centers) and should be givenat about the same time each day. Side effects: Mycophenolate may lower the number of white blood cells in yourbody, the cells that fight infection. It mayalso lower your platelets which help yourblood clot. Other side effects may includenausea, stomach irritation, vomiting, anddiarrhea. Side effects may decrease orresolve with a lower dose. Additional information: Do not change the dose of mycophenolate or take it more or less often than prescribed. Your dose of mycophenolate may be increased during an episode of rejection. The dose may be decreased if you have aninfection or if you have problems with side effects. Mycophenolate capsules should be swallowed whole and should not be opened. The powder inside the capsule may be harmful if inhaled. If you miss a dose of mycophenolate, take it as soon as you remember. If it is near the time for the next dose, skip the misseddose and resume your regular dosing schedule. Call your transplant coordinatorif you have missed a dose. If you are planning to become pregnant, discuss the use of mycophenolate with your transplant physician andobstetrician/gynecologist. Women of childbearing age should use contraceptionwhile on this medication and for 6 weeks after discontinuing sometransplant centers as \"pre-treatment\"(induction therapy) prior to transplantation.One dose of ATG is given about 4 hoursbefore transplant surgery to reduce yourbody's immune response and possiblyreduce the risk of rejection. Some transplantcenters also use ATG to treat rejection. Dose: ATG is available only as an intravenous (IV) solution and isadministered in the hospital. Side effects: Patients may have fever, chills, or difficulty breathing during theATG infusion. To minimize this \"infusion reaction,\" patients are usually treated withmethylprednisolone (a type of steroid),acetaminophen (Tylenol \u00ae)/paracetamol, and diphenhydramine (Benadryl\u00ae) before and during the infusion. The infusion may alsobe slowed down to decrease side effects.You will be closely monitored during the infusion to watch for any of these sideeffects. ATG can increase the risk of viral infections, so you may also receive preventative dosesof some antiviral medications. Other sideeffects include a low white count, lowplatelets, pain, headache, abdominal pain,diarrhea, high blood pressure, nausea,swelling of the hands and feet, an increasedheart rate, low blood pressure and anincreased level of potassium in the blood.OKT3 (Orthoclone \u00ae, muromonab-CD3) Purpose: OKT3 is an immunosuppressant used to treat moderate tosevere rejection Dose: OKT3 is given through an IV once a day for 5 to 14 days. Side effects: Some patients have a reaction to the first or second dose of OKT3.Methylprednisolone (an IV steroid) is givenbefore the first and second doses of OKT3to decrease these reactions. After the firstdose, patients may react with low bloodpressure, a high heart rate, fever, and flu-likesymptoms. Patients may also have areaction with wheezing, difficulty breathing,and fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). Patients are monitored closely during this period. In some transplant centers, patientsare monitored in the Intensive Care Unit(ICU) for 24 hours after the first dose. Other side effects may include high blood pressure, tremor, seizures, rash, itching,diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, joint pain,sensitivity to This medication is used in transplant patients to prevent or treat a typeof pneumonia called Pneumocystis cariniipneumonia (PCP). Dose: To prevent PCP, patients are prescribed Bactrim/Septra three times aweek, usually on Monday, Wednesday, andFriday. The adult dose is usually 80 mg, orone single-strength tablet. Bactrim/Septrais available as a tablet or liquid. Side effects: Patients who are allergic to sulfa drugs may have an allergic reaction toBactrim/Septra and may develop a rash,itching, and hives. If you are allergic, yourtransplant doctor will prescribe anothermedication to prevent PCP. Other side effects may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mouth ulcers, anemia, alow white blood cell count, or a low plateletcount. Bactrim may also cause an increasein the liver tests. Ganciclovir (Cytovene\u00ae) Valganciclovir (Valcyte\u00ae) Purpose: Ganciclovir (CMV) herpessimplex infections Barr Virus (EBV)infections. Dose: Ganciclovir is usually given twice daily for 14 days through an IV to treat anactive CMV infection. In some cases, itmay be given longer until the virus resolves.Some transplant centers give a preventativecourse of therapy for 14 days followingtransplantation, particularly if the patient isat risk for developing CMV . An oral tabletform (valganciclovir, Valcyte) is alsoavailable and may be prescribed daily for 3-6 months after transplant to prevent CMV in patients who are at risk for the virus.Valcyte is available as a 450 mg tablet. Side effects: Side effects may include: nausea, vomiting, headaches, pancreatitis,irritation from the IV infusion, confusion,and seizures. Ganciclovir can affect thewhite blood cell and platelet counts in theblood, but this usually resolves by decreasing the dose or by stopping the medication. Ganciclovir is eliminated by the kidneys, sopatients with kidney dysfunction receive alower dose. Animal studies have shownthat ganciclovir affects fertility and spermPrescribed Medications 18Liver Handbook production. It is recommended that male and female transplant patients receiving ganciclovir use contraceptive precautions during ganciclovir therapy and for at least 90 days after discontinuing the medication. Breastfeeding should be avoided during this period as well. Additional information: The first few doses of IV ganciclovir are usually given in the hospital, but most patients are able to finish treatment at home. Since ganciclovir is eliminated by the kidneys, drink plenty of fluids while you are receiving this medication. If you are taking valganciclovir (Valcyte \u00ae), swallow the tablet whole and take with food. It is recommended that patients take 2-3 liters of fluid daily (unless fluid restricted) while receiving valganciclovir. Avoid handling crushed or broken tablets. Wash the affected area thoroughly if there is contact with the powder. There is an increased risk of infection while on ganciclovir and valganciclovir therapy. Call your coordinator for any fever, chills, unhealed sores, or white plaques in your mouth. Acyclovir(Zovirax \u00ae) Purpose: Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used herpes simplexinfections (HSV-1, HSV-2) and varicella-zosterinfections (chickenpox, shingles).Acyclovir will help pain from theherpes lesions and also help them heal.Dose: The dose varies according to the type of infection and if used to prevent ortreat herpes simplex. The IV form may beused at first, and then changed to oral tablets (400 mg or 800 mg) or capsules (200 mg). Side effects: The most common side effects are headache, tiredness, dizziness, seizures,pain, insomnia, fever, rash, nausea, vomiting,diarrhea, elevated liver enzymes, muscleaches, and kidney dysfunction. Additional information: If you have herpes, acyclovir will not preventyou from spreading herpes to others.Condoms may help prevent the spread ofgenital herpes. Sex should be avoided when there are any herpes symptoms or active lesions. CytoGam\u00ae (Cytomegalovirus Immune Globulin,CMV-IGIV) Purpose: Cytogam is an immune globulin used to treat CMV and EBV disease inpatients CMV . Dose: Cytogam is given through an IV only. The dose and frequency varydepending on different transplant centerprotocols. It can be given to treat an activeinfection or to help prevent infection. Side effects: The most common side effects are flushing, sweating, muscle cramps, back pain, nausea, vomiting,wheezing, chills, and fever.Prescribed you are taking anti-rejection medications, particularlyprednisone, there is a greater risk for gettingan infection from fungus. This infectionusually develops in the mouth and throat,vaginal area, or on the skin. Dose: An antifungal is prescribed to treat fungus at the site of the infection. Nystatin,a liquid antifungal, is prescribed if a patienthas fungus or thrush in the mouth. Thedose is usually 5 cc swished and swallowed2 to 4 times a day. Sometimes a lozenge(Mycelex \u00ae) is prescribed to be dissolved in the mouth. Vaginal creams, suppositories,and ointments are also available for vaginalor skin infections. Side effects: Side effects are uncommon, but may include nausea, vomiting, anddiarrhea. Side effects of clotrimazole alsoinclude irritation, a stinging sensation, andincreased liver function tests. Additional information: The oral liquid should be swished and held in the mouth for as long as possible before swallowing. Patients should not eat or drink for about 15-20 minutes after taking the liquid or lozenge. The clotrimazole lozenge should be dissolved slowly in are at risk for developing stomachirritation and ulcers. This can be caused bysteroids and also stress (stress gastritis)which may increase the amount of acid inyour stomach. You may be prescribed 1 or2 of these antacids after transplant. Dose: The dose varies according to the medication prescribed. Some medicationscoat stomach ulcers while others inhibit theamount of acid that is being released in thestomach. Side effects: Most patients are able to take these medicines without any problems. The most common side effects of eachmedication include: famotidine: headache, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, dizziness, weakness, diarrhea cimetidine: headache, low blood pressure, low heart rate, dizziness, confusion ranitidine: headache, low or high heart rate, dizziness omeprozole: headache, diarrhea, nausea, Prescribed Medications 20Liver Handbook vomiting, abdominal pain lonesprazole: headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain sulcralfate: dizziness, sleepiness, vertigo, rash, itching, constipation antacids: side effects vary according to the minerals or electrolytes in the medication.antacids containing sodium \u2014 fluid retention antacids containing aluminum \u2014 confusion, constipation antacids containing magnesium \u2014 diarrhea Additional information: Antacids may increase or decrease the absorption of many medications. Antacids should be taken 1-2 hours away from (Prilosec \u00ae), lansoprazole (Prevacid\u00ae) and pantoprazole swallowed whole, not chewed. Sucralfate (Carafate\u00ae) should be taken before meals or on an empty stomach. It should be given 2 hours away from tacrolimus or cyclosporine. Medications for can cause imbalances in the body's electrolytes, the substances needed by yourbody to maintain fluid balance and many other functions. Sodium, potassium, chloride,magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus aresome of the electrolytes found in your body.When electrolytes are higher or lower thanthe normal range, medications such as theones listed above are used to correct thelevels. Magnesium Oxide (Mag-Ox 400) or Magnesium Gluconate (Magonate treat Side effectsof magnesium supplements include diarrhea,abdominal cramping, muscle weakness, a highmagnesium level, and low blood pressure. Fludrocortinsone (Florinef \u00ae): used to treat a high potassium level. Side effects includehigh blood pressure, swelling of the handsand feet, headache, rash, and low potassium. Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid (Bicitra \u00ae): used to treat low CO2levels, often resulting from diarrhea. Side effects include swellingof the hands and feet, increased gas,abdominal distention, and low levels of sodium, potassium and/or calcium. Neutra-Phos \u00ae: a phosphorus supplement. Side effects include low blood pressure, ahigh phosphorus level, nausea, vomiting,high potassium levels, and high blood pressure after liver transplantation as a sideeffect of medications, particularlyimmunosuppressants. High blood pressurecan also be a symptom of kidney dysfunction.Your transplant doctor will prescribe blood pressure medications to control high bloodpressure. Dose: Blood pressure medications may be prescribed 1 to 4 times daily, or when thepatient's blood pressure is above a certainrange. A variety of blood pressuremedications are available and your doctor willchoose the medication or the combinationof medications that are best for you. Over the Counter (OTC)Medications After liver transplant, patients may havecomplaints about common \"every day\"problems. There are some over-the-counter(OTC) medications that may be taken totreat these. However, these recommendationsvary by physician and transplant center. Pleasecheck with your transplant center for the OTCmedications that you are permitted to use.Diarrhea Diarrhea may occur after transplant as aside effect of some commonly prescribedmedications such as magnesium oxide(Mag-Ox) or magnesium gluconate(Magonate \u00ae). Although diarrhea may also result from certain foods that you do nottolerate very well, it may also be a symptomof a viral or bacterial infection. If you havediarrhea for more than 48 hours or if youdevelop fever with diarrhea, contact yourtransplant coordinator. Diarrhea may affectthe absorption of your medications andresult in lower than desired levels ofimmunosuppression. After evaluating yoursymptoms, your transplant team mayrecommend an OTC medication. Constipation If you are constipated, you may get somerelief by increasing your fluid intake as wellas the fiber content of your diet. Eat plentyof bran, whole grains, fresh fruits, andvegetables. Gradually increase your activitylevel. Medications and fiber supplementsthat Fiber-Con\u00ae, Senekot\u00ae, and Colace\u00ae. If constipation continues to be a problem, contact your transplant coordinator. Headache and Muscle Aches If you have a headache or muscle aches thatdo not occur with fever, acetaminophen(Tylenol \u00ae) may be taken. Check with your transplant coordinator for the recommendeddose of acetaminophen and the frequency ofdosing. Most centers advise 1-2 tabletsevery 4-6 hours, not to exceed 3 doses perday. If your headaches worsen and/orbecome more frequent, or if your headachePrescribed Medications 22Liver Handbook presents with fever or vomiting, contact your transplant coordinator. Most transplantcenters recommend that patients do not takeibuprofen products such as Motrin \u00ae, Advil\u00ae, Aleve\u00ae. Ibuprofen can cause kidney dysfunction and alsostomach irritation. Upper Respiratory Infections andSeasonal Allergies Although OTC medications may be taken forcold symptoms, these symptoms, particularlywhen occurring with fever, should be reportedto your coordinator. If it is determined thatyou have a community-acquired cold, askyour coordinator what cold remedy may betaken. Most OTC cold medications containan antihistamine, acetaminophen and/or acough suppressant. However, some coldremedies contain alcohol. Alcohol-containingcold remedies should be avoided. If you require an OTC antihistamine to relieve and treat the symptoms of a seasonalallergy, contact your coordinator for yourcenter's specific recommendations. Nutritional Supplements Patients are often advised to take a dailymultivitamin, vitamin supplements, and/ormineral supplements after transplantation,particularly if their nutritional status waspoor before transplant or if they have had adifficult recovery with complicationsfollowing surgery. Your dietician willadvise you about how to maximize yournutrition following transplant. Check withyour transplant coordinator before takingany nutritional supplement that has not beenprescribed for you.Herbal Products Most transplant centers stronglyrecommend that transplant recipients avoidtaking any type of herbal products/remediesor teas. In the United States, these productsare classified as dietary supplements by theFood and Drug Administration (FDA), so themanufacturers do not have to test them foreffectiveness, side effects, drug interactions,or safety, and doses are not regulated. St. John's Wort is a well-known herbal supplement that is used to treat depression.This herb increases the metabolism, orbreakdown, of medications which intransplant patients, can decrease cyclosporineand tacrolimus levels. Decreased levelsplace the patient at risk for rejection. Grapefruit juice is sold as an herbal supplement called paradisapfel, pomelo, andtoronja. A substance found in grapefruit andgrapefruit juice decreases the metabolism ofsome medications. Patients who are takingcyclosporine or tacrolimus may develop avery high level of their medication ifgrapefruit juice is taken anytime of day.Any form of grapefruit, including the herbalsupplement, should be avoided if you are prescribed tacrolimus or cyclosporine. Before taking any herbal supplement or remedy, you should check with yourtransplant team for the best advice. Do nottake any herbal supplements without tellingyour physician or transplant coordinator.These products can interact with yourmedications and lead to problems with yourliver transplant.Over the Counter Medications 23Liver Handbook Fever What is fever? Fever, or a high body temperature, is a symptom of the body's reaction to anorganism not considered as \"self\" by theimmune system. Fever can be caused byminor illnesses as well as serious infectionsand is usually defined as a body temperaturegreater than 101 degrees Fahrenheit (F) or38.4 degrees Celsius (C). Why would I get a fever? Healthy adults may have an occasionalfever throughout the year due to colds,influenzas, or other community-acquiredinfections. However, since your immunesystem is now suppressed so that thetransplanted liver will not be rejected,episodes of infection with fever may bemore common, particularly when you aremore highly immunosuppressed during thefirst 3-6 months after transplant or during periods of treatment for rejection. A hightemperature can also be a symptom of rejection. What should I do if I have a fever? It is very important to call your doctorand/or transplant coordinator if you have atemperature of 101\u00b0F (38.4\u00b0C) or greater.Since the temperature range may vary bycenter, check with your transplant coordinatorabout when to call for fever. Be sure thatyou have a thermometer when you leave thehospital and that you are able to read it.Digital thermometers are also available ifyou have trouble reading a glass thermometer. If you have a fever, call your transplant coordinator or physician as instructed atdischarge. Although acetaminophen(Tylenol \u00ae)/paracetamol may be used to treat fever after transplant, do not take any fevermedication until you have talked to yourcoordinator. If you are instructed to take acetaminophen (Tylenol \u00ae)/paracetamol, take the recommended dose at the time interval prescribed. Youmay also be instructed to have blood testsdrawn or to come to Transplant Clinic oryour physician's office for an examination. Ibuprofen (Motrin \u00ae, Advil\u00ae) is another medication used to treat fever, but shouldnot be taken by liver transplant recipientssince it can affect liver and kidney function. It can also cause stomach irritation and ulcers.Complications Following Liver Transplantation 24Liver Handbook My responsibilities for taking care of fever: I must have a working thermometer that my caregiver or I can read before I leave the hospital. I should have a supply of acetaminophen (Tylenol \u00ae)/paracetamol on hand to take for fever if I am instructed to do so. After I am discharged from the hospital, I should take my temperature every _________________________________. After _________weeks, I should take my temperature only if I feel ill or think I might have a fever. I should call my transplant coordinator or physician if my temperature is greater than ______ \u00b0F or ______ \u00b0C. The dose of acetaminophen/paracetamol that I should take if instructed to do so by my physician is:________mg or ____ tablets every _______ hours as needed for fever greater than ________. I should not take more than _____ doses in a 24 hour period. I should not take any ibuprofen products (Motrin \u00ae, Advil\u00ae) unless instructed to do so by my physician.Rejection What is rejection? Your body's immune system is designed to seek and destroy any foreign object that itfinds in your body, such as a cold virus, aflu virus, or a transplanted organ! Theprocess of destroying the foreign object \u2014the transplanted organ \u2014 is called rejection.It is very common for your body's immunesystem to try to reject the liver within thefirst month after transplant, usually at 7-10days. Most patients experience at least onemild to moderate rejection episode duringthis time. This is a normal reactionbetween your body's immune system andthe transplanted liver and shows that yourimmune system is working. However, inorder to protect the transplanted liver andmaintain good function of your liver, yourimmune system will need to be suppresseda little more so that the rejection resolves. Rejection may be called \"acute\", meaning that it develops quickly as your immunesystem attempts to destroy the liver cells. If the rejection process continues slowlyover time, it is called chronic rejection.Chronic rejection can be more difficult totreat than acute rejection because of themore permanent changes in the liver tissue. 25Liver Handbook How do I know I am rejecting my liver? Any injury to the liver can cause the releaseof normal liver proteins, or enzymes, intothe bloodstream. An injury could be causedby rejection, infection, or drug toxicities.Measuring these enzymes, called the liverfunction tests (LFTs), regularly and watchingthe pattern of the results can help your doctordecide what is happening to your liver. Liver rejection is usually diagnosed by looking at the liver function tests. Yourphysician may suspect that you have rejectionif any of these numbers are increased fromthe normal range. (Lab values are US measurements and may vary slightly by transplant center.) 26Rejection Test ALT duct obstruction bile duct obstruction malnutrition What are the symptoms of rejection? While you are in the hospital, the transplant team will be monitoring your liver functiontests (LFTs) daily to watch for rejection. Ifyou reject your liver during this time, youmay not have any noticeable symptomsbecause rejection was diagnosed earlythrough your blood test results. After you leave the hospital, your blood tests will be monitored less frequently. Ifrejection occurs, you may experience somemild symptoms, although some patientsmay continue to feel fine for a while. The most common early symptoms include:Fever/high temperature over 101\u00b0F or 38.4\u00b0C flu-like symptoms such as chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, body aches, tiredness abdominal pain or tenderness increased LFTs Later symptoms may be similar to problems you had before your transplant and mayinclude:yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) dark, tea-colored urineLiver Handbook light, clay-colored stools confusion increased fatigue abdominal swelling (ascites) How is rejection treated? Rejection does not mean that you will lose your liver, but it is very important to begintreatment as soon as possible to avoid furthercomplications. Rejection can usually betreated successfully if it is detected early. Rejection is usually treated by increasing the doses of your anti-rejection medicationsor by adding or combining differentanti-rejection medications. Your transplantteam may want to perform a liver biopsy toconfirm that your symptoms are caused byrejection before they make any changes toyour medications. You may be prescribedan increased dose of prednisone/prednisolonedaily or given solumedrol, the IV form ofprednisone. Sometimes another anti-rejectionmedicine, such as mycophenolate mofetil,sirolimus, or azathioprine may be added. When your liver recovers, your doses of these additional anti-rejection medicationsmay be decreased or discontinued. The levelof your primary anti-rejection medication,usually tacrolimus or cyclosporine, may bereduced. Your transplant team's goal is tohave you on the lowest amount ofimmunosuppression possible so that you donot reject your liver, have good liver function,and have minimal risk of infection andother side effects. What is a liver biopsy? Although liver function tests and yoursymptoms help diagnose rejection, a liverbiopsy confirms that the liver is beingrejected. A small piece of liver tissue is examined under a microscope for signs ofrejection Biopsies are usually done as short-stay procedures at the hospital. To prepare youfor the biopsy, an area on your right sidewill be cleaned with an antiseptic solution,such as betadine. You will be given aninjection of a local anesthetic, or numbingmedicine, into the area where the biopsywill be done. Sometimes an ultrasound isdone to determine the best place to insertthe biopsy needle. After the area is numb,the physician will advance a special coredneedle into the liver to take out a smallcylindrical piece of tissue. The actualbiopsy only takes a few seconds. The pieceof liver tissue may look like a small pieceof string. It is placed into a special solution,and then taken to the pathology lab to beprocessed and viewed under the microscope.Your biopsy results may be ready later that day, or you may be asked to return to clinicto discuss your biopsy results or anytreatment that may be necessary. Following a liver biopsy, you will need to lay on your right side for at least 1 hour,and you must rest in bed for 4-6 hours. Yournurse will take your vital signs every 15-30minutes during this time to watch for a highheart rate or respiratory rate and a lowblood pressure. You may also have a chestX-ray and some blood tests before youleave to be sure that there is no bleedinginternally from the biopsy site. Mostpatients feel fine after the biopsy.Sometimes the biopsy site may be a littletender, like a bruise, for a day or two. 27RejectionLiver Handbook 28Rejection Will I always have to be concerned about rejecting my liver? The risk of rejection decreases over time,but can occur at any time. Taking goodcare of yourself, taking your medications asprescribed, and having your blood testsdone as requested will help decrease yourrisk of rejection. Good communicationwith your transplant team and followingyour care routine are key factors for asuccessful outcome after transplant. Rejectioncan be successfully treated due to advancesin immunosuppression and combinations ofanti-rejection medications. My responsibilities for monitoring thesymptoms of rejection and decreasingmy risk for rejection: know and understand the signs and symptoms of liver rejection take all medications as prescribed make sure I always have a supply of my medications stay in regular contact with my transplant coordinator for any changes in my immunosuppression have my blood testing done as instructed follow-up on my blood test results with my transplant coordinator call my transplant coordinator or physician if I think I am experiencing anysymptoms of rejection avoid alcohol, illegal drugs, herbal supplements, and alternative medicines maintain good communication with my transplant teamPatients who have had liver transplants require anti-rejection medications, usuallyfor their lifetime, to suppress their immunesystem so that the liver is not rejected bythe body. Since your immune system isinhibited by these medications, transplantrecipients always have an increased risk ofgetting infections. This risk is highest inthe first 3-6 months after transplant or whenhigher levels of immunosuppression areprescribed to treat rejection. How Can I Decrease My Risk of Infection? If you are doing well, have good liver function, and have not had any episodes ofrejection, your transplant doctor willgradually lower your immunosuppressionlevel over time. This will help minimizeyour risk of infection. These guidelines may help decrease your risk of infection: Practice good handwashing techniques by using warm water, soap, and vigorous scrubbing for 1 minute. Be sure to scrub between your fingers as well. Wash your hands well before eating and preparing food, and after going to the bathroom. Avoid putting your fingers or hands in or near your mouth, particularly if you have not washed your hands recently. Encourage any family and friends who are in contact with you to practice goodhandwashing techniques. Wash your hands well before caring for any wounds or doing any dressing InfectionLiver Handbook 29Infection changes. Report any changes in the wound (increased redness, swelling, or drainage) to your transplant coordinator. Avoid close contact with people who have obvious illnesses such as colds and flu. Avoid any \"live\" vaccines including the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine, MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), and the oral polio vaccine. If for any reason you are told to get one of these immunizations, contact your transplant coordinator. Get a tetanus injection as needed if you have a skin wound from an object that could potentially cause an infection such as a piece of wood or a rusty nail. Consider getting the influenza vaccine every fall. Your close family contacts should also get this vaccine. Take the recommended antibiotics before dental work or any invasive procedures asinstructed by your transplant team. Do not share eating utensils, cups, and glasses with others since many viralillnesses are spread through saliva and mucous. Also, do not share razors or toothbrushes. Do not handle animal waste. Do not clean bird cages, fish or turtle tanks, or change cat litter. Practice safe sex. What infections are most common? There are 3 types of organisms that cause infections: bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Bacterial Infections Bacterial infections usually occur very early after transplant surgery and may be causedby central vein catheters, infections insidethe abdomen, or wounds. Patients maydevelop pneumonia, particularly if they hadcomplications during or early after surgeryand required a prolonged stay in theintensive care unit. Urinary tract infections may occur from having a urinary catheter todrain urine. Although rare, abscesses candevelop in the liver if the patient developsclots in the major liver arteries and veins.Another type of bacterial infection ischolangitis, or an infection in the bile ductsof the liver. If you develop a blood infection, blood specimens will be sent to the lab to find outwhat type of bacteria is causing the infection.Your doctor will prescribe a specific antibiotic to treat that bacterial infection. Fungal Infections Fungal, or yeast, infections are most common in the first 3 months aftertransplant. These infections usually do notget into the bloodstream. The most commonfungus, Candida, looks like a white plaqueor coating on the tongue and inside themouth. This infection is also called thrush.It may make your mouth tender and soreand you might have difficulty swallowing ifit is coating your throat as well. If thrush isnot treated, it can also infect the esophagus,stomach, and intestines. Women may get a vaginal infection with candida. The vaginal area may becomevery itchy and there may also be a thickyellow or white discharge from the vagina. These types of fungus infections are often seen when patients are taking high doses ofprednisone. They usually resolve whentreated with topical medications such or clotrimazole.Liver Viral Infections Cytomegalovirus a common community-acquired virus and is not aserious illness for most people who arehealthy. However, CMV may be of moreconcern to people who are takingimmunosuppressive medications. CMV is a common infection that usually occurs within 2-3 months after transplant.Some patients are more at risk for CMVthan others. The patients who are at highestrisk are those who: are CMV-negative and received a CMV-positive liver or CMV-positive blood products received high levels of immunosuppression received OKT3 to treat rejection Because CMV is such a common infection, transplant centers usually have treatments toprevent this infection, particularly inpatients who are considered to be at highrisk for getting the virus. Most treatmentplans to prevent CMV include ganciclovir.Some centers continue preventative treatmentfor up to 3 months after transplant. Usingthese treatments to prevent CMV hasdecreased the rate of this infection. Symptoms of CMV include fever, a low white blood cell count and a low plateletcount. A CMV infection in the lungs cancause fever, coughing, shortness of breath,or wheezing. If CMV develops in thegastrointestinal (GI) tract, it causesdiarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,and/or bloody stools. If CMV infects yourliver, your LFTs may increase and you maythink you have rejection. A liver biopsywill confirm if the diagnosis is rejection ora CMV infection. CMV is suspected if you have fever and any of these symptoms, butis confirmed through a special blood test. The medical management of CMV infection after liver transplant varies by transplantcenter; however, the treatment usuallyincludes a 14 day course of intravenousganciclovir followed by 6-10 weeks of oralvalganciclovir (Valcyte \u00ae). Additionally, immunosuppression may be lowered during the infection so that theimmune system helps fight the virus. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and Post-Transplant LymphoproliferativeDisorders (PTLD) EBV is a very common virus and most adults have been exposed to it at some pointin their lives. In patients who areimmunosuppressed, EBV can occur at anytime after transplant, but most commonlyoccurs within the first year. This virus rangesfrom \"mono\" (infectious mononucleosis) to a more serious disease, PTLD, which can cause tumors or a lymphoma. The viruscauses some cells to multiply or proliferateat a higher rate than usual. This can lead tothe development of a lymphoma. Some transplant centers monitor patients who are at high risk of developingEBV-related complications. Since beingimmunosuppressed has caused the virus todevelop, the best treatment is to lower orstop immunosuppression until the virusresolves. Patients are monitored veryclosely during this time so that if they beginto reject, immunosuppression can beresumed or increased. Intravenousmedications to treat the virus are also given.Taking Care of Yourself and Your LiverLiver Handbook Clinic After discharge from the hospital, you will be seen regularly as an outpatient at yourcenter's Transplant Clinic. Most patientsare seen 1-2 times every week for 2-4weeks, then less frequently as they improveand return home. Long-term patients whohave good liver function may be seen onlyonce a year. Most transplant centers willmanage the patient's immunosuppressionfor the rest of their lives, with the patient'slocal physician managing routine care. Clinic routines vary greatly by center. It may be helpful for you to discuss the followingquestions with your coordinator. When should I come to Clinic? My first clinic appointment is: ________________________________ Clinic is held every: ________________________________ Where is Clinic? Clinic is located: ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________What should I bring to Clinic? Medication list or record Vital signs record (if requested) Blood sugar records (if you are a diabetic) Your liver handbook Afamily member or caregiver Any medications that need to be taken during clinic times ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ What is the usual Clinic routine? Registration Blood tests Waiting room Examination by my transplant doctor with a review of my blood test results and medications Meet with my coordinator to: review care answer my questions or concerns be aware of and understand any changes in my care or medications get prescriptions or have any new meds or med changes ordered Schedule or report for any additional procedures (biopsy, X-ray, etc.) Meet with my Social Worker if needed Attend support group meetings if scheduled 31Liver Handbook Vital Signs When you leave the hospital, you may be asked to regularly check your temperature,pulse, and blood pressure \u2014 called your\"vital signs\". Understanding what eachvital sign means and what your normalrange is for each vital sign is important. If you experience difficulty breathing or any chest pain or pressure, call 911 (EmergencyServices) and ask to be taken to the nearestEmergency Room. Never try to driveyourself or have a caregiver take you to thehospital if you have these symptoms. Youmay require care as soon as possible andyour caregiver may not be able to help youwhile driving. You should always call 911. Blood Pressure Blood pressure is the measure of force in your arteries. It is a measure of two typesof pressure, the systolic and the diastolic.The blood pressure measurement writtenas 120/80. systolic blood pressure isthe \"top number\" of blood pressuremeasurement and measures the force of themuscle contraction of the heart as blood ispumped out of the chambers of the heart.The diastolic blood pressure is the \"bottomnumber\" and is when the heart muscle is atrest between beats, expanding and fillingwith blood. If you are asked to record your blood pressure, you and your caregiver will betaught how to take your blood pressurebefore you leave the hospital. Your centerwill provide you with a cuff or instruct youon where you may purchase one. Cuffsmay be manual (you pump them yourself)or digital (automatic). If you have a digitalcuff, be sure to measure how accurate it is with a cuff used by your nurse or in theclinic. Accuracy varies in some of thedigital pumps. High blood pressure (hypertension) may occur early on after liver transplant and isusually related to the side effects of somemedications or kidney dysfunction. It canusually be managed well with bloodpressure medications and/or someadjustments in your diet, such as lowsodium diets. A common symptom of highblood pressure is headache. My blood pressure may range from _______/_______to _______/_______. I should take my BP ________ times every day at _________________ and before I take any blood pressure medicine. I should call my coordinator if my BP is greater than _____/______. I should record my BP on the Vital Signs Form (see page 59). 32 Liver Handbook Temperature Normal body temperature is 98.6\u00b0 F or 37\u00b0 C. If your temperature is rising, youmay feel hot or cold, achy, and/or developchills or sweat. Fever is an importantsymptom and can occur with rejection orinfections (see Fever, page 24). I should take my temperature ______ times daily or whenever I feel ill. I should call my transplant coordinator or physician if my temperature is greaterthan ______ \u00b0 F or ______ \u00b0 C. The dose of acetaminophen/paracetamol that I should take if instructed to do so by my physician is:________mg or ____ tablets every _______ hours as needed for fever greater than ________. I should not take more than _____ doses in a 24 hour period. I should not take any ibuprofen products (Motrin \u00ae, Advil\u00ae) unless instructed to do so by my physician. Pulse Your pulse is created by your heart beat. When you take your pulse, you are feelingthe pressure of your blood in an artery fromthe beating of your heart. The pulse rate isthe number of times your heart beats in aminute, for example 72 beats per minute (bpm). Your pulse can be felt in your wrist or neck. You can also listen to your pulse with a stethoscope over your heart. You may beadvised to take your pulse when you take your blood pressure or if you feel like yourheart is beating too fast or \"racing\". Youmay also be asked to take your pulse if youare on certain heart medications that affectyour pulse rate. My normal pulse when resting is: _____________________. My normal pulse when active is: _____________________. I should call my coordinator if my pulse isgreater than ______ or less than______. Weight You may be asked to weigh yourself daily or 2-3 times a week to monitor for anylosses or gains. Your weight will also bemonitored at every clinic visit. You shouldcheck your weight as often as instructed ona bathroom scale at the same time eachmorning. After you go to the bathroom, butbefore you eat breakfast is a good time.Record your weight on the Vital Signs Form(page 59). Gaining or losing weight,particularly if this happens suddenly, can bea sign of problems in your recovery. Asudden weight gain could mean that you areretaining fluids. This could be a side effectof medications or a sign that your kidneysare not working well. A sudden loss couldmean you are dehydrated which can beharmful to your heart and kidneys. Callyour transplant coordinator with any suddenweight changes. 33Vital SignsLiver Handbook Blood Tests Monitoring blood tests is another way your transplant team follows your recovery andchecks how your transplanted liver andother important body systems arefunctioning. Your medications may beadjusted based on your test results. Blood tests are done frequently after transplant while you are in the hospital tomonitor your recovery and progress. Asyou improve, your blood tests will bechecked less often. Your blood tests maybe repeated more frequently if you haverejection, infections, or other complications.When you return home, you may be askedto have your blood tests done locally.Depending on your transplant center, it may be your responsibility to arrange this. Yourcoordinator will advise you on where to goand how to have your results sent to thetransplant center. You may also want tokeep a record of your results (page 37). My blood tests should be checked every: ________________________________ I will get this done at: ________________________________ Results faxed to: ________________________________ Any special instructions: ________________________________ ________________________________ 34Lab values of blood tests vary by center. Please adjust the normal ranges in the tables below to your center's guidelines. If your lab results are out of the normal range, your physician or transplant coordinator will discuss these with you. Some abnormal lab values may be acceptable as you recover from transplant or a related complication and should improve over time. (Lab values are US measurements.) Test Bili sign of rejection or infection Bile duct obstruction Malnutrition Liver injury, rejection Liver injury, rejection Liver injury, rejection, bile duct obstruction Malnutrition Malnutrition, chronic liver dysfunctionNormal Range (US Values) 0.1 - 1.2 mg/dl Function Your liver function tests (LFTs) will be monitored to check how well your new liver is working and to watch for any signs of rejection, infection, and/or blockage of the bile ducts.Liver Handbook Tests that Monitor Kidney Functionand Electrolytes These tests are important to follow to be sure your kidneys are functioning properlyand that the fluid balance in your body iscorrect. Anti-rejection medications can sometimes effect how well your kidneys work, so it is important that kidney functiontests are also checked regularly. If yourkidneys are not working well, you may alsohave abnormal levels of your electrolytes.Your physician will treat any problems with adjustments in your immunosuppressionand/or other medications to treat electrolyteimbalances. 35Test BUN Cr Na K+ Mg++ Glu Ca++Name Blood urea nitrogen Creatinine Sodium Potassium Magnesium Glucose Calcium (total)Result Kidney dysfunction, dehydration, high protein diet, side effect of some anti-rejection medications Liver disease; over-hydration Kidney dysfunction, side effect of some medications, dehydration Muscle wasting Side effect of diuretics; kidney dysfunction Side effect of medications; kidney dysfunction Side effect of diuretics; decreased intake, vomiting Kidney dysfunction Diarrhea; side effect of medications Diabetes, problems with the pancreas, side effect of some medications Occurs in liver disease or with thyroid problems High intake of calcium often caused by taking too many antacids; bone disorders, thyroid problems Kidney dysfunction, over-hydration, problems with the pancreas, severe malnutritionNormal Range (US Values) The Complete Blood Count (CBC) will bemonitored with your routine labs to checkfor infection, the effects of anti-rejectiondrugs, anemia, and to make sure you havethe normal range of each type of blood cell. 36Test WBC Hct Hgb PltName White blood cell count Hematocrit HemoglobinPlateletsResult Cells that fight infection and are also involved in the rejection process.

After livertransplant, patients need a diet high incalories and protein to rebuild muscle tissueand restore protein levels. Dietaryrequirements are different for everyone, soyour dietician will meet with you aftertransplant to discuss your specific nutritionaland caloric needs and any dietaryrestrictions you may have. Most patientswill need to increase calories as well ascalcium and protein intake. Some patientsmay have to limit intake of sugar, salt(sodium), or potassium-containing foods. Transplant recipients may also be at greater risk for bone fractures due to poor nutritionbefore transplant, chronic liver disease, orlong-term use of steroids (prednisone). Abone density test may be ordered to checkfor calcium loss and weakness in your bones. Your physician and dietician may recommend that you take calciumsupplements and increase your dietary intake of calcium. Good sources of calcium include: yogurt, low fat milk products(ricotta cheese, skim or low-fat milk, provolone cheese, mozzarella cheese), sardines, salmon, dark green leafy vegetables, and calcium-fortified orange juice. Regular exercise will also helpprevent bone weakness. During the first few weeks after transplant you may have some trouble eating due toloss of appetite, feeling full or nauseated, oryou may have changes in taste. This isquite common and will resolve over time as you recover and your activity increases.While your appetite is low, you might tryeating several small meals a day, snackbetween meals on high calorie and highprotein foods, and/or drink higher calorieliquids such as milk or juice rather thanwater. Your dietician can help you planyour meals and snacks. If you feel full orbloated, try to eat frequent small meals,avoid foods that may cause additional gas,eat foods that are high in carbohydrates andproteins rather than fats, or sip on fluidsbetween meals instead of during meals. Ifyou are nauseated during your recovery,foods high in carbohydrates such as pasta,cereal, bread, pretzels, and fruit may help.Nausea may also be decreased by drinkingginger ale and lemon-lime sodas. Spicy andfatty foods should be avoided if you arenauseated. If you continue to haveproblems with nausea, your physician mayorder a medication to help decrease thisfeeling. If you are experiencing changes intaste, try using seasonings and spices toenhance the flavors of your food.Marinating meat, poultry, or fish can also behelpful. If you continually have a bad taste 38 Liver Handbook in your mouth, drinking cold fluids or sucking on hard candies may also help. Patients often have high potassium levels in their blood following liver transplant. Anincreased potassium level (hyperkalemia)could be due to anti-rejection medicationsor kidney dysfunction. High levels ofpotassium may cause the heart to beatirregularly. If your potassium level is high,it will be controlled by a medication calledfludrocortisone (Florinef \u00ae) and/or dietary limits of high-potassium foods. bananas, spinach, squash, tomatoes,ketchup, cocoa, coffee, nuts, cereals withfruits and nuts, and salt substitute. Yourdietician will advise you on how manyservings of these foods you may have dailyif your potassium level is high. While it is important to regain lost weight and to rebuild your protein stores, youshould also be careful not to gain too muchweight once you have returned to yourrecommended weight. Being overweightmay contribute to other health complicationssuch as heart disease and diabetes. Regularlow-impact exercise such as walking orriding a bicycle can be very helpful. Youshould start all activities slowly thengradually increase your activity as yourendurance improves. The recommended weight range for my height is: _______lbs to _______ lbs(_____kgs to _____kgs). Safe Food Handling Safe food handling is important for everyone.However, you may be at an increased riskof getting a food-born illness since you aretaking anti-rejection medications. Thefollowing guidelines will help decreaseyour risk of getting an infection from food. Follow the safety instructions on food packaging. Avoid raw or undercooked meat, fish (sushi, oysters), poultry, or eggs. Foods should be cooked thoroughly and served hot. Always check labels on meats, fish, and dairy products for freshness and \"sell by\" dates. Buy pasteurized milk, cheese, and fruit juices. Store foods appropriately. Place foods in the refrigerator or freezer as soon as possible if they require cold storage. Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap before and after preparing food and particularly after you touch raw meat, fish, or poultry. Wash all surfaces that come in contact with raw meat, fish, or poultry. Scrub all raw fruits and vegetables before cooking or eating them. Some centers caution patients not to eat food from salad bars due to possible contamination by others or from buffets ifthe food temperature is not hot enough. 39NutritionLiver Handbook Activity Exercise It is common to feel tired or weak as yourecover from liver transplant. If you havebeen hospitalized for a long time before orafter your transplant, you may have lostsome muscle mass from prolonged bed rest.You may also find that your sleep pattern is disturbed. Regular exercise and goodnutrition will help get you back to a normal,active routine and an eventual return toyour home routine, work, or school. While you are in the hospital, you may receive physical therapy to help you regainstrength and increase your activity level.Your physical therapist can help you start a simple exercise routine. Walking for shortperiods several times a week can be thestart of a good exercise routine once youleave the hospital. Regular exercise isimportant for everyone to control weight,improve cardiovascular health, increaseendurance, and even to reduce stress. For the first 6 months after transplant, you may be advised to avoid any strenuousactivity, heavy lifting, or more intensiveexercise programs. Check with yourcoordinator and physician for your center'sguidelines. The best activity in the first fewweeks after transplant is walking. Mostcenters recommend that any activities orsports with a high risk of injury likefootball, wrestling, skiing, water skiing, ormotorcycling, should be avoided for at leastone year after transplant although somecenters restrict contact sports indefinitely. Liver transplant patients may swim in chlorinated pools after all drainage tubesare removed and their incision and woundsare healed. Patients should avoid small standing bodies of water such as ponds orsmall lakes that may contain infectiousorganisms. Patients may swim in oceans orlarge lakes if the water is tested to be safeby the local health department. Public hottubs should be avoided. Returning to Work or School Patients return to work or school at varioustimes depending on the extent of theirillness before transplant, recovery time,complications, and the type of work that isdone. Most patients are ready to return towork or school within 2-3 months aftertransplant. It is often helpful to return on apart-time basis and increase your hoursslowly as your energy and enduranceimproves. Discuss your return with yourtransplant doctor and coordinator to decidethe time that is best for you based on yourworkplace and responsibilities. 40 Liver Handbook Driving Most patients can resume driving within 4-6weeks after transplant, but this also dependson your recovery period and medications.Your reflexes and judgment may be affected from a prolonged hospitalization or fromcertain medications, so it is best to discussthis with your transplant doctor andcoordinator before getting behind the wheel.It may be helpful to have another licenseddriver in the car with you for the first fewtimes that you drive after transplant. Youmay also want to practice driving in anopen lot or away from other traffic for thefirst time as you get used to driving again.It is important that you always wear a seatbelt even if you still have an open wound.Padding your abdomen with a towel orsmall pillow will help cushion yourabdomen from the seat belt while providinga safe restraint in case of an accident.Sexual Activity Sexual activity is an important part ofnormal adult life. Your desire and sexualfunction may have been very limited beforeyour transplant due to your liver diseaseand illness. Both men and women may findas they recover from liver transplant thattheir desire for sexual activity has returned.Most centers advise that patients wait for6-8 weeks before resuming sexual activity because of the stress on the abdominal muscles, but how quickly patients feelready for sex after transplant is differentwith every person. Ask your transplantdoctor or coordinator when it is medicallysafe for you to have sex. Also discuss any concerns with your spouse/partner so that he/she understands your feelings aboutresuming sexual activity. Sexually Transmitted Diseases Since transplant recipients are immunosuppressed, they are at higher risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases(STD), particularly if they are not in amonogamous (one partner) relationship. Ifyou are not in a monogamous relationship,it is imperative that latex condoms are usedto decrease the transmission of STDs duringsexual activity. Practicing safe sex is the best way to prevent STDs and is important for everyone who issexually active. Safe sex practices include:Having sex with only one partner (a monogamous relationship) Washing your genitals before and after sex. Always using latex condoms with a spermicide Avoid having sex with anyone who has sores, a rash, or a foul discharge from their genitals Avoid anal sex. 41Activity Liver Handbook There are some additional considerations for patients who have received transplantsfor hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Sexualpartners of patients who have hepatitis Bmay wish to be tested for the virus andshould be vaccinated if they are not immune.Sexual transmission of hepatitis C is rarebut can occur. Sexual partners may also betested for this virus. However, if this is along-term sexual relationship and partnersdo not have the virus, the risk of contractingthe infection may be low. You may wish totalk to your transplant doctor or coordinatorif you and your partner are consideringwhether or not to use condoms. Birth Control and Pregnancy Female transplant patients who did notmenstruate before transplant because ofliver disease and illness, often begin toovulate or menstruate within a few weeks tomonths after liver transplant. Mosttransplant centers recommend that womenavoid getting pregnant for 1-2 yearsfollowing liver transplant . Birth control barrier methods using latex condoms with spermicidal jelly or creamwith nonoxynol-9, or the sponge ordiaphragm with spermicide are recommended.Patients with multiple partners shouldalways use a condom as well. Before usingbirth control pills, the Norplant, or gettingan injection of Depo-Provera, you shouldcontact your gynecologist and transplantcoordinator. These methods may be used insome cases, but recommendations vary bytransplant center. Most centers recommendthat barrier methods be used for severalmonths until the liver function is stable andthere are no further complications with infections. Oral contraceptives orimplantable devices may then be considered. For female transplant recipients who are considering becoming pregnant, prenatalplanning and consultation with yourobstetrician and transplant team isimperative to ensure a healthy pregnancyfor you and your baby. Some medicationsmay be harmful to the developing fetus andmust be stopped before you become pregnant.If you plan to become pregnant, discuss thisimportant issue with your transplant doctor,obstetrician, and coordinator before youstop using birth control. Generally, pregnancy after transplantation is successful. Many female transplantrecipients have become pregnant anddelivered healthy babies. There is however, an increased incidence of prematurity, lower birth weights, and Caesarian sections. The mother also has an increased risk of high blood pressure and preeclampsia.Breastfeeding is not recommended sincesome medications can be transmitted to theinfant through breast milk. Outcomes ofpregnancies of transplant recipients arebeing followed through the NationalTransplantation Pregnancy Registry (NTPR). Your physician can discuss the findings of this group in greater detail with you if youare considering becoming pregnant. 42ActivityLiver Handbook Other Concerns Drinking Water It is safe for you to drink treated municipaltap water after your liver transplant. If youlive in an area that has well water, it is bestto boil that water to a rolling boil for atleast 1 minute before using it for drinkingwater. Well water should be tested by yourlocal water authority every 6-12 months,even if you are not using it for drinkingwater. Contact your local water authority orthe EPA Safe Water Hotline (in the US) at800-426-4791. Travel As you recover and return to a more normalroutine, you may consider traveling orgoing on a vacation. Please check withyour transplant coordinator for your center'sguidelines on traveling early aftertransplant. Some centers recommendwaiting for 6-12 months before you take anextended vacation, particularly one that maybe remote. If you are planning a vacation, you may be advised to have your blood tests taken a fewweeks before to be sure there are noabnormal levels. You should call yourcoordinator if you need to review your meds, blood test results, or any specific care needs. If you are traveling to a differenttime zone, discuss how to adjust yourmedication times with your coordinator.Before you leave, be sure you know wherethe closest hospital and/or transplant centeris located in case of an emergency. Be sureto take enough medication to last yourentire trip and if flying, pack yourmedications in a carry-on bag. Taking extramedication and packing the extra medicationsin a different bag may also be helpful. Take all your important phone numbers with youin case you need to call your transplantcenter while you are away. You may wantto drink bottled water if you are traveling inareas where the sanitation is of concern. Most transplant centers discourage travel to third world countries for patients who areimmunosuppressed. The risk of acquiringinfections in these areas is high andappropriate healthcare may not be available.Additionally, some foreign travel mayrequire immunizations that are not safe forpatients who are immunosuppressed, suchas measles and smallpox. If you plan totravel in this type of area, please discussthis with your transplant doctor andcoordinator so that you are fully informedof the risk. Medic-Alert Identification Many centers recommend that patients weara Medic-Alert necklace or bracelet to beidentified as a transplant recipient in case ofan accident and/or if emergency care isrequired. Medic-Alert, located in Turlock,CA, is a nonprofit membership organizationthat is recognized internationally. The organization's goal is to protect and save lives by providing information duringemergencies. These tags are recognized byemergency operations teams as they care foraccident victims. Your coordinator can provideyou with information on this company oryou can contact them at 1-800-432-5378 orat http://www.Medicalert.org to become amember, order your tag, and to update themon any medical information that you wouldlike to have in your file. 43Liver Handbook Pets Pets can be an important part of family life.Research has shown that pets help relievestress and have positive physical andpsychosocial benefits, as well as possiblyimproving our quality of life. One study hasreported that older adults who had petswere better able to handle crisis situations. Although animals do carry a number of diseases that can be transmitted to humans,few are life-threatening. If you followsome common-sense guidelines, your riskof acquiring an infection is minimal. Wash your hands thoroughly after petting or playing with your pet, particularly before you eat, drink, or handle food. Be sure that your pet is healthy, has regular check-ups, and has received its required immunizations. Groom and/or bathe your pet regularly. Keep cat's claws trimmed. If possible, avoid your pet's bodily fluids (urine, feces, vomit). If your pet has an accident, have someone else clean it up if possible. If not, wear gloves and clean thearea with a disinfectant. Don't let your pet lick your face. Do not change your cat's litter box if possible. The litter and liner should be replaced frequently and the litter box cleaned at least monthly with a disinfectant or boiling water. Contact your physician immediately if you are bitten by any animal. Avoid stray or sick animals and exotic animals.Plants Some centers recommend that transplantpatients avoid exposure to live plants andsoil for 3-6 months after transplant. If youhave a cut on your skin, you are at greaterrisk of infection since many types oforganisms grow in the soil. If you are agardener, be sure to wear gloves wheneveryou are working in the soil. It is alsohelpful to wash your hands every so oftenwhile gardening as well as when you aredone working. Try to avoid compostpiles and rotting materials when possible. Check with your transplant coordinator foryour center's guidelines. Sunscreen Transplant recipients have a higher risk of developing certain types of skin cancers.Patients should use a sun screen with a sunprotection factor (SPF) of at least 15 whenout in the sun. Additionally, patients shouldwear a hat and limit their exposure to thesun, especially when the sun is highest inthe sky from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM. 44Other Concerns Liver Handbook Routine HealthcareFollow-up When you return home, you will resume routine care with your local physician andother health professionals. However, mosttransplant centers prefer to manageimmunosuppression and any transplant-related care such as episodes ofrejection, liver biopsies, and sometransplant-related infections. Check withyour coordinator so you know who to callwhen you have any signs or symptoms ofillness. In some cases, you may be told tosee your local doctor, and then return to thetransplant center for further evaluation.Your local doctor may be asked to perform certain blood tests and send the report to thetransplant center. Local Primary Care Physician (PCP) Your local physician is usually an internal medicine physician or a hepatologist whowill see you for routine medical follow-up.This physician usually manages preventativehealthcare, routine physical examinations,immunizations, and complications related tohigh blood pressure, diabetes, highcholesterol, or bone disease. You may beasked to see this physician within the first 2months of returning home. Your transplantcenter should have the contact informationfor your local physician before you leavethe transplant center. The coordinator willforward information to your local physicianabout your transplant surgery, post-opcourse, and your current care. Your coordinator will also discuss the transplantcenter's role in your care and how each physician can work cooperatively to be sure you do well. Your local physicianplays an important role in examining you for any possible complications. Be sure to see this doctor regularly and have reports ofthose visits forwarded to your transplantcoordinator. Dental Care Routine dental examinations every 6months are essential for good dental healthfor everyone. However, since you areimmunosuppressed, an abscessed tooth orgum infection could lead to more seriouscomplications. Additionally, gum overgrowth(gingival hyperplasia), a side effect ofcyclosporine, may lead to bleeding gumsand infection. Although changes inimmunosuppression may help, in somecases the overgrown gums will need to besurgically reduced. 45 Liver Handbook You should visit your local dentist within 3-6 months of returning home. Yourtransplant coordinator can forward anymedical information that the dentist needsfor your health history. Preventativeantibiotics are required for any invasivedental work, which may include cleaning,before the procedure. If there is anypossibility that the gums will be cut, there isan increased risk of infection. Your dentistwill know what to prescribe for this, buthe/she can also call your coordinator for your center's protocol. Amoxicillin is usually used prior to the procedure, but check withyour dentist or transplant coordinator beforeany invasive dental work. Vision Care Routine eye examinations are usuallyrecommended every other year. However,some patients may require exams every6-12 months if they have any risks forvision or eye problems. Prednisone, givenin high doses for prolonged periods, maylead to the development of cataracts and/orglaucoma in some patients. Visit yourvision care specialist within 2-3 months ofreturning home so he/she is updated onyour health status and can assess your riskfor any complications. Gynecological Care Women should have yearly check-ups as usual with their local gynecologist.Papanicolaou's smear (Pap smear) andmammograms should be completed asrecommended for your age and any riskfactors. After liver transplant, there may bean increased risk for cervical and breastcancers. If you are of child-bearing age, discuss appropriate birth control methods with yourgynecologist. Birth control should bestarted before you resume sexual activity.Barrier methods are recommended until thepatient is several months to a year aftertransplant. At this time, oral contraceptives or implanted devices may be considered. Your coordinator can also forward information about your liver transplant to this physician and provide the center's recommendations for birth control methods. If you are planning to become pregnant,discuss this with your gynecologist beforeyou stop using birth control. 46Routine Healthcare Liver Handbook Immunizations Immunizations are a part of routinehealthcare. You have probably received allyour required immunizations as a child andnow may only require boosters for specialreasons. Now that your immune system issuppressed, you must not receive any live vaccines. Receiving a live vaccine couldcause serious health complications becauseyou may develop the virus you are beingimmunized against. This is because theseimmunizations contain some of the actualvirus. You should never receive these live viruses: Oral polio (Salk vaccine): An inactivated form of this vaccine, theSabin injection, is now available instead ofthe oral vaccine. This injection does notpose a risk to someone who isimmunosuppressed. Some centersrecommend that transplant recipients avoidall contact with patients who have had theoral polio vaccine for up to 8 weeks since the virus might be shed in their stool andsaliva. If you have a young child, be surethat your child receives the inactivated formof the vaccine. MMR (measles, mumps, rubella): This is another live vaccine given to childrenat 12-15 months and again at 4-6 years. Asan adult, you should not need this vaccine.You do not need to avoid a child who has recently received the MMR.Varivax (chickenpox or varicella vaccine): This is a live vaccine given to children at 1year of age to immunize them againstchickenpox (varicella). People who areimmunosuppressed should not receive thisvaccine. Some centers believe you may beat risk if you are in close contact with achild who has received the vaccine. Checkwith your coordinator for your center'sguidelines. Influenza Vaccine The yearly \"flu shot\" (injection) is aninactivated vaccine to provide protectionfrom influenza. Most transplant centersstrongly encourage transplant recipients andtheir close family contacts to get thisvaccine every year. You can receive thisvaccine if it is at least 3 months since youhave had your liver transplant. Influenzamay be more serious in someone who isimmunosuppressed. This vaccine willprotect you from the 3 most commonstrains of influenza that are reported for thatyear. You should not receive the influenzavaccine if you are allergic to eggs or chicken. Tetanus Toxoid The general public is advised to get atetanus booster every 10 years. If you get adirty injury or cut, or are bitten or scratchedby an animal, you should get this vaccine. 47Routine HealthcareLiver Handbook Other Health Concerns Smoking Smoking is a risk to everyone's health.Smoking can cause cancer, heart disease,and lung disease. Additionally, smokersmay have prolonged respiratory infectionsbecause of the effect of smoke on the lungs.Transplant recipients who smoked before transplant are strongly encouraged to stopsmoking. Since nicotine is broken down ormetabolized by the liver, there is a possibilitythat some medications, particularlytacrolimus and cyclosporine, may not bemetabolized well and that levels of thesemedications may be lower in smokers. Youshould never risk losing your healthy liverfor cigarettes. Your transplant coordinator or social worker can help you find local support groups tohelp you stop smoking. If you wouldlike additional information and support,contact the following organizations: American Heart Association http://www.Americanheart.org American Lung Association http://www.2lungusa.org/ American Cancer Society http://www.cancer.org If you are interested in using any medications to help you stop smoking, suchas the NicoDerm \u00aepatch, discuss this first with your coordinator to check on yourcenter's recommendations.Alcohol Alcohol is metabolized, or broken down, inthe liver. Drinking any type of alcoholicbeverages can harm your liver. Many ofyour medications are metabolized by theliver and with the additional stress ofbreaking down alcohol as well, liver cellsmay be destroyed. If you have had a problem with alcohol in the past, this was probably discussed atyour transplant evaluation. You may havehad to attend counseling sessions or youmay have been enrolled in a rehabilitationprogram before you received a livertransplant. It is important that you continuecounseling as you recover from transplantto avoid any possible injury to your healthyliver through alcohol use. There are manyways your transplant center and localphysicians can help you recover andcontinue to do well after transplant. Illegal Drug Use Drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, LSD, andEcstasy are toxic chemicals that are harmfulto the liver as well as other organ systems.These toxic drugs will harm the sensitiveliver and interfere with the break down ormetabolism of your transplant medications.The illegal use of drugs is not tolerated byany transplant center. If you have hadproblems with illegal drugs in the past orare concerned you may want to use themagain, discuss this issue with yourtransplant coordinator, social worker, orcounselor. Help is available throughcounseling and support programs. 48Liver Handbook Glossary of Terms A ABO TESTING Blood tests that classify human blood intoone of four groups: O, A, B, or AB. ALBUMIN Albumin is a protein made by the liver thathelps maintain fluid balance in the body. ANEMIA Adecreased amount of circulating red blood cells in the body. Anemia may resultfrom blood loss, destruction of red bloodcells, or a decrease in the production of redblood cells. The hemoglobin level (hgb) isdecreased in patients with anemia. ANTIBODY An antibody is a protein produced by theimmune system in response to specificantigens. Antibodies help the body fightorganisms that cause infection as well asany foreign substances. ANTIGEN An antigen is a substance, usually found onthe surface of cells, that identifies the cellas \"self\" or \"non-self\". The antigen causesan immune response through antibodyproduction against the antigen. ARTERIOGRAM An arteriogram is a radiologic study (x-ray)or picture of the arteries in an organ systemthat is visualized through a special dye thatis infused in the blood stream.ASCITES An abnormal accumulation of fluid in theabdomen. B B CELLSB cells are a type of lymphocyte, or whiteblood cell, that develop in the spleen andare responsible for the body's immunity. B cells produce antibodies which help fightinfection and foreign substances. BILE Fluid made by hepatocytes, the liver cells,that is secreted into the bile ducts and theninto the small intestine to help absorb fats. BILE DUCT Avessel in the liver that carries bile from the liver cells to the common bile Asubstance made from the break down of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a substance inred blood cells that carries oxygen to bodytissues. Red blood cells are trapped anddestroyed in the spleen as they wear out.When these cells are destroyed, bilirubin isreleased into the blood (unconjugatedbilirubin). The liver then processes thistype of bilirubin, combines it the individual liver the bile ducts, and into the intestine 49Liver Handbook where it leaves the body in the feces. The characteristic brown color of feces is due tobile. Patients with liver disease often haveclay-colored or tan feces since the liver maynot be producing bile due to missing orblocked bile ducts. An elevated bilirubinlevel may also be a sign of liver rejection. BIOPSY Abiopsy is a procedure that provides a small amount of tissue from an organ,tumor, bone, or other body tissue to find outmore information about that organ or tissue.Acore needle biopsy is usually performed to examine liver tissue. A tiny cylinder oftissue, showing liver cells and how they arearranged, is removed through puncture withthis needle. This tissue is examined underthe microscope by a pathologist to determinethe cause of liver disease, or to look for anyevidence of rejection or infection. BLOOD UREA NITROGEN (BUN) Atest that indicates kidney function. The BUN is a product of protein breakdown, or waste product, normally excreted by thekidney. C CALCIUMAmineral measured in the blood that is required for bone growth and for bloodclotting. It is also needed for the heart andnerves to function. CATHETER Aflexible tube that enters or exits the body. Catheters may be used to drain body fluids(a Foley catheter drains urine) or toadminister fluids or medications through avein (a Broviac catheter).CHIMERISM The existence of more than one geneticbackground within one person. Transplantrecipients show chimerism through geneticmarkers since they have cells from thedonor organ in their bodies. CHOLANGITIS Abacterial infection in the bile ducts of the liver. Cholangitis can occur if bile flow isobstructed due to scarring of the duct or anobstruction in the duct. It can also occur inpatients who had bile duct reconstruction orthe Kasai procedure when bacteria from theintestine can invade the liver. Symptoms ofcholangitis may include fever, an elevatedbilirubin level, jaundice, and low bloodpressure. Antibiotics are used to treatcholangitis. Patients with recurrent cholangitismay be prescribed a preventative dose ofantibiotic daily. Treatment of the obstructionthrough surgery or transplantation willultimately resolve cholangitis. CHOLESTASIS An accumulation of bile in the liver. Thiscan be caused by medications, an injury tothe liver, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), orgallstones and may resolve over time orwhen the medications or TPN are discontinued.Cholestasis may also occur as a symptom ofmany liver diseases. CHOLANGIOGRAM Atest that examines the bile ducts in the liver for any leaks or blockages. A dye isinjected into the bile ducts and then theliver is examined through an x-ray. 50GlossaryLiver Handbook CHRONIC Having a disease for a long period of time.Chronic disease may worsen slowly overtime. It may be treatable but is usually notreversible. CIRRHOSIS Cirrhosis occurs when something destroysthe liver cells causing the cells to die.When many cells die, there is scarringthroughout the liver. A cirrhotic liverbecomes very firm, unlike its normalspongy texture, and can be shrunken in sizeor enlarged. COAGULATION The process of blood clotting. A variety offactors are necessary for the blood to have anormal clotting ability. Clotting ability isassessed by several blood tests includingthe prothrombin time (PT), partialthromboplastin time (PTT), and plateletcount. An abnormal clotting time is oftenseen in patients with liver disease. COAGULOPATHY Decreased ability of the blood to clot whichincreases the risk of bleeding, particularlywith surgery or any invasive procedures such as biopsies. COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT (CBC) or FULL BLOOD COUNT (FBC)Ablood test that measures many parts of your blood count including the hemoglobin (hgb), hematocrit (hct), platelets (plt), andmany SCAN Tomography scan; a noninvasiveradiologic study that a detailedcross-section of organ and tissue structure.CREATININE The creatinine level is an indication ofkidney function. It is a waste productproduced by the muscles and released intothe blood stream. Creatinine levels may beincreased with kidney disease. Abnormalcreatinine levels are also seen in patientswith kidney dysfunction caused by liverdisease or medications. CROSSMATCH This is a test that examines how well thetransplant recipient's blood matches withthat of the donor. A high positive cross-match may indicate the need for higherlevels of immunosuppression for the liverrecipient. A negative crossmatch meansthat there is no reaction between the donor'sand recipient's blood. CYTOMEGALOVIRUS CMV; a virus commonly seen followingtransplantation that can cause an infectionin the gastrointestinal tract, blood, liver,lungs, and/or eyes. CMV is a type ofherpes virus.

Sodium,potassium, chloride, magnesium, calcium,and phosphorus are some of the electrolytesfound in your body. ENCEPHALOPATHY Confusion or an altered mental status. Encephalopathy may be seen in patientswith end-stage liver disease. Due to liverdysfunction, ammonia can not bemetabolized by the liver. Ammonia buildsup in the brain and interferes with oxygengetting to the tissue, causing confusion andtiredness. Medications such as lactulose,and a low protein diet can help decrease theammonia level so that the patient does notdevelop encephalopathy.ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (EKG/ECG) Anoninvasive test that records the electrical activity of the heart. ENZYME Aprotein made in the body that is capable of changing a substance from one form toanother. The ALT and AST are enzymesfound in liver cells. ERCP Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram. A test thatexamines the drainage system ducts ofthe gallbladder, pancreas, and liver (thebiliary tree). FIBROSIS The presence of fibrous tissue in the liverthat causes scarring and liver dysfunction.Fibrosis develops into cirrhosis.

Glucose levels may varywith diet, medications, stress, and organdysfunction. GRAFT An organ or tissue that is taken from oneperson and placed into another (transplantation).Agraft between humans or the same species with different genetic material is called an allograft. A graft between dif ferent species, such as a baboon to human, is called a xenograft. H HEMATOCRIT (HCT) Ameasurement of the amount of red blood cells in the blood. HEMATOMA Abruise; swelling caused by the accumulation of blood in tissue.HEMOGLOBIN (HGB) Asubstance in red blood cells that gives blood its characteristic red color and containsiron and protein. Hemoglobin carriesoxygen from the lungs to the tissues andcarbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. HEPATIC Aterm that refers to the liver or having to do with the liver. HEPATIC ARTERY The blood vessel that carries oxygenatedblood to the liver from the heart. HEPATIC VEIN The blood vessel that carries deoxygenatedblood from the liver to the heart.

The histology ofa liver disease, for example, would bedetermined by examining a piece of livertissue from a biopsy under a microscope. HYPERLIPIDEMIA Ahigh level of fats (triglycerides or cholesterol) in the blood. This can be caused by diet,genetic disorders, or medications. HYPERTENSION High blood pressure. I IMMUNE SYSTEMAspecialized system of cells and proteins that protect the body from organisms thatmay cause infection or disease. IMMUNITY The ability of the body to resist a specificdisease. IMMUNIZATION Providing the body with protection fromcertain diseases through vaccinations. IMMUNOSUPPRESSED Describes the immune system of atransplant recipient which is weakened orinhibited by certain medications. Specificmedications (such as cyclosporine,tacrolimus, and prednisone) are used tolower the ability of the immune system toattack foreign cells (the transplanted tissue).Immunosuppression will help decrease thebody's ability to reject the transplanted organ.INFECTION Organisms such as bacteria, fungi, andviruses that invade the body and reproducecausing a variety of symptoms. INSULIN Ahormone secreted in the pancreas by the Islets of Langerhans that regulates sugarmetabolism. Insulin helps the body usesugar and other carbohydrates. As insulin isreleased in the body, the blood glucose leveldecreases. INTRA VENOUS within the blood stream. Fluids andmedications may be given intravenously aswell as by mouth (PO). J JAUNDICETerm used to describe a yellow appearance of the skin and eyes commonly seen inpatients with liver disease. Jaundice resultsfrom an increased amount of bilirubin in thebody. L LIVER FUNCTION TESTS (LFTs)Blood tests used to determine how well theliver is functioning. These include the ALT,AST, GGTP, bilirubin, and alkalinephosphatase. LYMPHOCYTES Cells produced by the lymph glands that areresponsible for immunity. They defend thebody against infection and foreign substancesby producing antibodies and other substances. 54GlossaryLiver Handbook M MAGNESIUM Amineral required for normal bodily function. Magnesium is involved in nerve,skeletal muscle, heart, and cell function. Itis also involved in blood clotting and thebreakdown of carbohydrates and proteins. N NEPHROTOXICITYKidney damage, usually as a result ofmedications or other substances. NEPHROLOGIST Amedical doctor who specializes in the diagnoses, treatment, and management ofkidney diseases. NONADHERENCE/NONCOMPLIANCE Failure to follow instructions for medicalcare after transplantation. This may includenot taking medications as prescribed, notobtaining labs as instructed, or missing clinicappointments and tests. Nonadherence is asignificant post-transplant issue that oftenresults in rejection, infection, an ultimately loss of the graft. P PNEUMOCYSTIS (PCP) Abacterial infection of the lungs that is more common in immunosuppressedpatients. Transplant recipients are usually prescribed an antibiotic (Bactrim \u00ae/Septra\u00ae) to prevent this type of pneumonia.PLATELET Atype of blood cell that is involved in the clotting process. Platelets help stop bleedingat the site of the injury by clumping andforming a clot. If the platelet count is low,there is an increased risk of bleeding. PORTAL HYPERTENSION This term describes increased pressure inthe veins that collect blood from thestomach, spleen, pancreas, and intestines(the portal system). The blood from all theveins of these organs is collected into theportal vein, which drains into the liver. In a diseased liver that has fibrosis or cirrhosis, the blood from the portal vein may not beable to flow easily through the liver.Increased pressure then develops in theportal vein and can cause an enlargedspleen, fluid in the abdomen (ascites),and/or enlarged veins in the stomach oresophagus (varices). PORTAL VEIN The vein that collects blood from the stomach,spleen, pancreas, and intestines and carriesthat blood to the liver. PTLD Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease; a wide spectrum of viral disorders associatedwith the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) that mayrange from a self-limiting mononucleosis(\"mono\", glandular fever) to a type oflymphoma, or cancer of the lymph nodes.PTLD is a complication of a suppressedimmune system and occurs in only a smallpercentage of patients. Treatment includeslowering immunosuppression andadministering antiviral medications. 55GlossaryLiver Handbook POTASSIUM Amineral required for normal body functioning. Potassium is important inhelping the heart, nerves, and musclesfunction properly. Potassium also helpschange carbohydrates into energy and informing proteins. The kidneys excrete anyextra potassium in the body. It is importantto follow potassium levels after transplantbecause some antirejection medications cancause an increase in the potassium level. PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS Medications that are prescribed to preventcertain infections in a specific group ofpatients who are at a higher risk for theseinfections. PRURITIS Itching. Patients with liver disease mayhave increased itching due to liverdysfunction since there is an accumulationof bile salts in their skin. R RENALAterm that refers to the kidney or having to do with the kidney. REJECTION Aprocess in which the body's immune system attacks the transplanted organ,usually resulting in damage to that organ.S SODIUMAtype of salt found in the blood and required by the body to maintain thebalance between electrolytes and water. SHINGLES Aviral infection caused by the herpes zoster virus that usually affects an area by anerve, resulting in fluid-filled blisters andpain. Shingles are most commonly seen onthe neck, abdomen, and legs. The virus canalso affect the nerves of the eye. SPLEEN An organ located under the rib cage on theleft side of the abdomen. The spleenremoves old or deformed red blood cells,white blood cells, and platelets. It alsomakes lymphocytes, a type of white bloodcell that help produce antibodies. Thespleen may enlarge (splenomegaly) inpatients with liver disease. SPLENOMEGALY Splenomegaly is a term used to describe anenlarged spleen. In patients with liverdisease, splenomegaly results from portalhypertension. Splenomegaly can cause alow platelet count that may increase the riskof bleeding. SYSTOLIC This is the \"top number\" of blood pressuremeasurement. The systolic pressure measuresthe pressure as the heart muscle contracts topump blood around the body. 56GlossaryLiver Handbook T TCELLS Tcells are a type of lymphocyte, or white blood cell, that develop in the thymus glandwhich is located in the upper chest in frontof the heart. T cells are associated withacquired immunity, or the ability of thebody to fight an infection or foreignsubstance that it was exposed to in the past.Tcells play a major role in the rejection process. TTUBE Aflexible tube may be placed inside the common bile duct to drain bile from theliver to the outside of the body into adrainage bag. Sometimes liver transplantrecipients have this drainage bag for a fewweeks after transplant to insure that bile isdraining well from the transplanted liver. THRUSH Afungal infection that looks like white plaques or spots in the mouth (oral mucosa),throat, and on the tongue. Patients who areimmunosuppressed are more at risk fordeveloping thrush. U ULTRASOUNDAtest that displays internal bodily organs, blood vessels, and ducts using sound waves.An ultrasound of the liver may be obtainedto examine the size of the liver and spleen,the size and blood flow in the hepatic arteryand portal vein, and the size and patency ofthe bile ducts.V VARICES Enlarged blood vessels, particularly in thestomach and esophagus VITAL SIGNS The measurement of temperature, bloodpressure, heart rate, and respiratory(breathing) rate W WEANTo slowly withdraw or reduce; Immunosuppression, particularly steroids,may be weaned slowly over time in patientswho do not reject the transplanted liver. WHITE BLOOD CELL This is a type of blood cell that fightsinfection. 57GlossaryLiver Handbook Transplant Educational Resources, SupportGroups, and Organizations American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases http://www.hepar-sfgh.ucsf.edu American Association of Kidney Patients (AAKP) http://www.aakp.org American Organ Transplant Association (AOTA) http://www.a-o-t-a.org/ American Liver Foundation http://www.liverfoundation.org/ Children's Liver Alliance http://www.liverkids.tk Children's Liver Association for Support Services http://www.classkids.org Children's Organ Transplant Association (COTA) http://www.cota.org Coalition on Donation http://www.shareyourlife.org Fujisawa Healthcare, Inc. http://www.fujisawausa.com International Transplant Nurses Society http://www.itns.org Minority Organ Tissue Transplant Education Program http://www.mottep.orgNational Council on Patient Information and Education http://www.talkaboutrx.org National Foundation for Transplant http://www.transplants.org National Transplant Assistance Fund http://www.transplantfund.org National Kidney Foundation, Inc. http://www.kidney.org Sangstat http://www.sangstat.com Transplant Health http://www.Transplanthealth.org Transplant Patient Partnering Program http://www.rocheusa.com Transplant Recipients' International Organization (TRIO) http://www.trioweb.org Transplant Speakers International http://www.transplant-speakers.org Transweb http://www.transweb.org United Network of Organ Sharing http://www.unos.org 58ITNS is not responsible or liable for any information located as a result of visiting these websites.
