Kennedy Jr. is the son of assassinated Senator Robert. F. Kennedy, and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He is famous - or rather infamous - for being outspoken in his opposition to vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine. Here is the relevant section from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.): During the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), Kennedy promoted multiple [conspiracy theories related to COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic#Origin_misinformation) including false claims both [Anthony Fauci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fauci) and the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation#Global_health_division) are trying to profit off a vaccine, and suggesting that [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates) would cut off access to money of people who do not get vaccinated, allowing them to starve. In August 2020, Kennedy appeared in an hour-long interview with [Alec Baldwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin) on [COVID-19 vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine), falsely suggesting that it contributed to the death of 86-year-old [Hank Aaron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Aaron) and others. In February 2021 his Instagram account was blocked for \"repeatedly sharing debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines.\" The [Center for Countering Digital Hate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Countering_Digital_Hate) identified Kennedy as one of the main propagators of conspiracy theories about Bill Gates and [5G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G) phone technology. His success as a conspiracy theorist increased his social media impact considerably; between the Spring and the Fall of 2020, his Instagram account grew from 121,000 followers to 454,000. In November 2021, Kennedy's book The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health was published wherein he alleges Fauci sabotaged treatments for AIDS, violated federal laws, and conspired with Bill Gates and social media companies such as Facebook to suppress any information about COVID-19 cures, to leave vaccines as the only options to fight the pandemic. [[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.#cite_note-217) [[218]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.#cite_note-218) In the book, Kennedy calls Fauci \"a powerful technocrat who orchestrated and executed the historic 2020 coup against Western democracy\". He claims Fauci and Bill Gates plan to prolong the pandemic and exaggerate its effects, promoting expensive vaccinations for the benefit of \"a powerful vaccination cartel\". [[219]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.#cite_note-NZZ-219) The [Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neue_Z%C3%BCrcher_Zeitung) has said of the book \"...polemics alternate with chapters that pedantically seek to substantiate Kennedy's accusations with numerous quotations and studies.\" [[219]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.#cite_note-NZZ-219) Kennedy wrote the foreword for [Plague of Corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Corruption) (2020), a book by former research scientist and anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist [Judy Mikovits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Mikovits). [[220]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.#cite_note-220) Kennedy appeared as a speaker at the partially violent demonstration in [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) on August 29, 2020, where [populist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populist) groups called for an end to restrictions caused by COVID-19.

Two-thirds of the posts were shared by what CCDH calls the \"Disinformation Dozen\": - Joseph Mercola, - Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., - Ty and Charlene Bollinger, - Sherri Tenpenny, - Rizza Islam, - Rashid Buttar, - Erin Elizabeth, - Sayer Ji, - Kelly Brogan, - Christiane Northrup, - Ben Tapper, - Kevin Jenkins. Last week, Kennedy Jr. has surpassed himself.
