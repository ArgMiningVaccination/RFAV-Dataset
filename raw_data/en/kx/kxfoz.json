Our Roots Go Deep From our roots as farmers and herbal soap makers, we began to create our own natural body care products because we could not find high quality and pure commercial products. Our products are made in small batches to ensure the highest quality. Foxhollow Herb Farm herbal products use only the highest quality vegetable oils: almond, grapeseed, pecan and extra virgin olive oil. Our essential oils are derived directly from the plant itself. We also steep our herbs and flowers in sun warmed oils for several weeks to extract their fragrance and active ingredients. Everything is tested on family and friends prior to selling to the public. Thank you for ordering our products and gifts. As you enjoy nature's benefits benefits through each product, you will feel good knowing that you are treating yourself to a natural experience! Warmest regards, Rey "}
