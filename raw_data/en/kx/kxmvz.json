I stayed in a comfortable cute house with a weet-roof. I was the only one in this ceremony and he accompanied me the hole time. It was a very intense experience for me. I drunk the tart medicine from the liane called ayahuasca. An half hour later I felt the intense effect. I don't have really words for this! Attention - everyone have a different experience. Mine was amazing! First all was in million colors. All breaking to this atoms. I saw the universe. After I throw up one time and then I had more than 8 hours hallucinations. It's very important to focus on your inner master and your breathing. A god step is when you already know meditation and follow the diet before. I felt a intense harmonious relationship to mother earth and all creatures on this planet. My spiritual Guide Joel guided me the complete ceremony with traditional music. After he advised me and in the evening I ate some tasty homemade soup. It was one of my best experiences in live I ever had! Muchas Gracias.

I came out of the jungle into Cusco and decided to pay 270\u20ac for an Ayahuasca ceremony outside the city, since I didn't have the time to go back to the jungle. They recommend a diet for at least 1 day, which sounds surprisingly short, I did 4. A driver picked us up downtown 4pm. We were joined by a woman from Argentina, a friend of Joel's, who had brought 2 bottles of ayahuasca from Pucallpa. She was joining the ceremony, so was the driver. We spoke spanish. We arrived in an isolated, quiet little town in a beautiful valley. After some preparations we entered the ceremony room, reading some practical meditation instructions developed by Joel. Joel is a spiritual guide, not a shaman, who's been arranging ceremonies for this company for a few years now. He learned methods from shamans around the Amazon area. He does not take ayahuasca during the ceremonies. We started the ceremony around 7pm with all due preparations, I felt comfortable and safe. After maybe 40min from the first dose of ayahuasca I couldn't feel any effects, so Joel gave me a second dose. While the other participants were already having a purge and a connection, I proceeded to take a 3rd dose, after which I vomited. It wasn't until late at night after the 4rd cup that I felt the effects. Joel kept chanting and playing instruments most of the time, taking short breaks with records playing on the background. The effects lasted maybe an hour, I think I fell asleep. I woke up and found that Joel and the driver were gone. Everyone came back, we closed the circle and went to sleep. Maybe I'm not susceptible, maybe the dose was not right. Joel tried to explain that I experienced a lot of purging, which is important to attain a connection. I understand that part of it is vomiting, for me it was most of it. Obviously I wouldn't get a refund, Joel suggested I join a San Pedro ceremony the next night for $100, but I couldn't afford it. I had two amazing ceremonies (San Pedro and Ayahuasca) with Joel in the community Paru Paru. The ceremonies were magical, intense, cleansing, healing, eyes and heart opening. I felt so connected to the nature and full with love. I got deep insights and visions. For me these medicines are life changing. Joel has a very positive energy and he is leading the ceremonies with passion and love. I liked the well guided journeys and his magical music a lot. The hospitality in the community was excellent and the people are so lovely. I'm so thankful for the wonderful experiences. It exceeded my expectations! After a somewhat hectic, lost, low past year in my home city Vancouver, Canada. Coming to Cusco, Peru has, to say the least, altered my life in an incredible way. And as amazing as Peru is in itself, Ayahuasca has showed me a new outlook on my life. And I wouldn't have had an awesome atmosphere and surroundings if it wasn't for Joel and his creation Portal Of Light. Honestly! Who's ever reading this and is looking for a safe, secure, warm loving enviournment, do not bother looking further. I did a one night Ayahuasca ceremony early November, then a few weeks later attended another ayahuasca and San Pedro ceremony with Joel and a bunch of amazing people. Who I now share an unreal connection with. It gave me insight on my own demons and issues, showed me things I didn't even know were an issue in my life and literally switched my life around. I feel less afraid of a lot of things, living more in the present moment and more a lighter happier kick in my step. Joel is one of the most beautiful, pure hearts I have met in a long time. He is passionate about his work, humble, caring and will do anything to help make the experience for you easier. I will be coming back to Cusco, Peru one day, and I sincerely hope to come back and experience another ceremony with Joel. I met amazing new friends, and a new insight on my life. A new chapter in my life. And I'd like to thank Joel and Mother Ayahuasca. This is something that I have researched for years and I discovered that I didn't have to go to the jungle to do it. I did ayahuasca one night and the following morning san pedro. I throughly enjoyed the 24 hours of internal bliss. If you're tired of the 9-5 or simply looking for a different perspective of yourself this is how you find the questions to your answers or just another truth. I was lucky to be a part of a group of complete strangers for san pedro whose hearts matched thier minds and hiking was just another pinnacle moment on this journey. If you're not afraid to face your inner demons or just looking for a way to be more open to the world this is for you! I still feel so connected. This is for those who are on a path of discovery of self. I have spent about six months in Cusco doing ceremonies with different companies/Shamans/spiritual guides. I have done six ceremonies with 4 different people, and am happy to recommend Joel's ceremonies, both Ayahuasca and San Pedro (Wachuma). I did a private Ayahuasca ceremony with Joel in a house next to a river, which was one of the most influential experiences of my life. And I did a San Pedro ceremony with a group of other people outdoors in the mountains, some of whom had just come out of an Ayahuasca ceremony with him a few hours prior. I enjoyed the San Pedro even more-- it was arguably the best day of my life so far. The rest of the group was buzzing about how transformational their Ayahuasca experience was and how much they recommended transitioning from Ayahuasca at night into San Pedro the next morning. If you're unsure, I recommend the San Pedro as it is more suave and easy for inexperienced people, but I would certainly recommend both. I have had a difficult past and cannot stress enough how life changing these medicines have been for me. I am happier, calmer, less anxious, my thoughts are clearer, I am more respectful to others, and most importantly the ceremonies gave me tools to carry with me into my everyday life-- even after the ceremony ended. For me, this is the difference between your typical drugs and these medicines. Whether illegal drugs or alcohol or pharmaceuticals, you might feel better while using them, but you can get addicted and often need more drugs to function in the way you might think you want to function. These medicines are taken respectfully in ceremony and have created new pathways in my thought process and new realizations to be able to live better for the rest of my life. I am endlessly grateful.
