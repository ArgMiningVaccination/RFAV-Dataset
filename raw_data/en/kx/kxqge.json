STATE OF ALASKA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MEDICAID COORDINATED CARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT 5 SECTION 2. BACK GROUND INFORMATION SEC. 2.01 BACKGROUND INFORMATION Introduction The mission of the State of Alaska Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) is to promote and protect the health and well-being of Alaskans. In pursuit of its mission, the department has three service priorities: 1. Health and wellness across the lifespan; 2. Health care access, delivery and value; and 3. Safe and responsible individuals , families and communities. DHSS is an umbrella agency that administers or provides most of the state's health and social services, includin g Me dicaid, publi c health, senior and disabili ty services, behavioral health services, publi c assistance, juvenile ju stice, and child protection services. DHSS also administers a number of residential facilities, includin g the Pioneer Homes (s tate-owned assisted living facilities), the state psychiatric institute, and secure juvenile detention and institutional treatment facilities. Medic aid Reform Senate Bill (SB) 74, passed by the Alaska legislat ure in April 2016 and signed into law by the Governor in June, direct s DHSS to undertake a series of Medicaid reforms intended to improve qual ity, increase value, and control spending . SB 74 includes initiatives related to frau d and abuse prevention and detecti on, primary care case manag ement, and reform of the behavioral health system. The law also directs DHSS to implement coordina ted care demonstration projects, participate in a hospital emergency department improvement initiative, and implement other payment reform measures. SB 74 includes authorization for the Department to apply to the federal government for Section 1115 Medicaid waivers, and to add new Medicaid state plan services s uch as Section 1915(i) and (k) home and community based services and Section 1945 health home services. Responders to this RFI are highly encouraged to review SB 74 closely to understand the scope of the reforms and consider how they might interrelate. A summary of each of the major delivery system reforms and a note about the status of impleme ntation of each follows. A link to SB 74 is included at the end of this Section. Coordinated Care Demonstration Project SB 74 adds AS 47.07.039, which directs DHSS to contract with one or more third parties to implement one or more coordina ted care demon stration projects for Medicaid beneficiaries identified by the Department. The purp ose of the demonstration(s) will be to assess the efficacy of various health care delivery models with respect to cost, access, and quali ty of care. SB 74 requires that proposals for demonstration projects include three or more of the following elements: STATE OF ALASKA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MEDICAID COORDINATED CARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT 6 1. Comprehensive primary-care-based manag ement for medical assistance services, includin g behavioral h ealth services and coordination of long-term services and support; 2. Care coordination, including the assignment of a primary care provider located in the local geographic ar ea of the recipient, to the extent practical; 3. Health promo tion; 4. Comprehensive transitional care and follow-up care after inpa tient treatment; 5. Referral to community and social support services, includin g career and education trainin g services available through the Department of Labor and Workforce Development under AS 23.15, the University of Alaska, or other sources ; 6. Sust ainability and the abilit y to achieve similar results in other regions of the state; 7. Integration and coordina tion of benefits, services, and utilization manag ement; 8. Local accountability for health and resource allocation; and/or 9. An innovative payment process, includin g bundl ed payments or global payments. Proposals for demonstration projects must also include information demonstrating how the project will im plement cost-saving measures, includin g innovations to reduce the cost of care for Medicaid beneficiaries through expand ed use of telehealth for primary care, urgent care, and behavioral health services. DHSS is permitted by SB 74 to contract with entities situated to improve care coordination for Medicaid recipients and meet the goals of this project, including provider -led entities, Accountable Care Organizations, managed care organiza tions, primary care case manag ers, and prepaid ambula tory health plan s, to implement a demonstration project. The demonstrations ' fee structures may include global payments, bundl ed payments, c apitated payments, shar ed savings and risk, or other payment structures. DHSS is required to request proposals for at least one coordina ted c are demonstration project by December 31, 2016, and is permitted to seek additional project proposals annually thereafter. The statute establishes a Proposal Review Committee (PRC) to review proposals for demonstration projects and defines the membership of the committee. It also requires the Department to work with the state Division of Insurance to streamline the applicatio n process for a company to obtain a certificate of authority required under AS 21.09.010 as necessary to participate in a demonstration project. There are no state funds available to support planning and development of proposed demonstration projects. T he contracts established between DHSS and successful demonstration project organizations will be agreements to make policy, programmatic and system changes , including reimbursement changes, required by both parties to implement the proposed model. SB 74 requires the Department to contract with a third-party actuary to review demonstration projects establis hed under the bill. The actuary is to review each demonstration project after two years of implementation and make recomm endations for the implementation of similar projects. In addition, DHSS is required to prepare a plan for the legisla ture regardin g regional or statewide implementation of a coordinated care project based on the results of the demon stration projects by November 15, 2019. STATE OF ALASKA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MEDICAID COORDINATED CARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT 7 Implementation Status: The State Health & Value Strategies initiative of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has contracted with the Pacific Health Policy Gr oup (PHPG) on behalf of the Department to provide consultation on the development of the solicitation for the Coordinated Care Demonstration Project s (CCDP) . The Department released an RFP on August 26 soliciting the services of a Medicaid payment reform and actuarial consultant to support, in part, evaluation of CCDP proposals . This consultant will also analyze potential costs and savings of other reform initiatives , identify and analyze potential innovative payment models, provide the cost analysis required for the 1115 waiver application for behavioral health reform, and evaluate the selected CCDP proje cts two years following implementation. The link to this RFP is provided at the end of this Section. The release of this Request for Information is an essential step in the Department's development of the CCDP request for proposals. Current CCDP Initiat ive Timeline (subject to revision) : o September 2016: Request for Information issued o October 2016: Establish contract with payment reform and actuarial consultant o December 2016: Request for CCDP proposals issued o February 2017: CCDP proposals due to the d epartment; Proposal Review Committee (PRC) convened o March - April 2017: Department and payment reform/actuarial consultant analysis of proposals for PRC o May 2017: PRC review of proposals o May - June 2017: Selected CCDP offeror negotiations with Department o Date (s) of CCDP agreement (s) implementation will be dependent on negotiations ; federal approvals; and statutory , regulatory and system changes required for implementation (if necessary) Other Medicaid Reform Initiatives Other reform initiatives established by SB 74 may relate to the development of Coordinated Care Demonstration Projects . A summary of each of these initiatives is provided below. 1115 Waiver: Behavioral Health Mana ged System of Care SB 74 adds AS 47.05.270(b) requirin g DHSS to develop and manag e a comprehensive and integrated behavioral health program that uses evidence-based, data-driven practices to achieve positive outcomes for people with mental health or substance abuse disorders and children with severe emotional disturban ces. The program must include a plan for providing a continuum of community- based services to addr ess housing, employment, criminal justice, and other relevant issues. It also must include services from a w ide array of providers and disciplines, and efforts to reduce operational barri ers that fragment services, minimize administrative burdens, and reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of the program. STATE OF ALASKA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MEDICAID COORDINATED CARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT 8 SB 74 also adds AS 47.07.036(f) requir ing the Department to appl y for a section 1115 waiver under 42 U.S.C. 1315(a) to establish one or more demonstration projects focused on improving the state's behavioral health system for Medicaid beneficiaries . The 1115 demon stration project must be consistent with the comprehensive and integra ted behavioral health program required under AS 47.05.270(b) and include continuin g cooperation with the gran t-fund ed community mental health clinics and drug and alcohol treatment centers that have historically provided care to recipients of behavioral health services. DHSS anticipates c ontracting with an Administrative Services Organiz ation (ASO) to implement the behavioral health managed system of care required under the legislation. The ASO would be a third- party organiza tion with special ex pertise in behavioral health systems manag eme nt. The department would contract with the ASO through a competitive biddin g process to provide certain specified administrative se rvices necessa ry to manage the behavioral health system of care on the state's behalf. Implementation Status : o The Department has convened six public -private workgroups to support the design and development of the 1115 waiver application for Behavioral Health Reform . Those teams are: Policy, Benefit Design, Quality, Cost, Data, and Writing. o Current DHSS 1115 Waiver for Behavioral Health Reform Timeline (subject to revision) : December 2016: Submission of 1115 Waiver Concept Paper to CMS January 2017: Release of RFLOI for ASO Services April - June 2017: 1115 Waiver application public revie w process June 2017: Submission of 1115 Waiver application to CMS January 2018: Award of ASO Contract Note that proposals for Coordinated Care Demonstration Project ( CCDP ) models that integrate behavioral health services at the community or regional level are welcome , and the Department will work to align the CCDPs with the behavioral health system reforms . However, due to the schedule of the required be havioral health sys tem reforms noted above, CCDP proposals that would propose a statewide behavioral health system model will not be considere d, as such a model would preempt the system reform work currently underway. Primary Care Case Mana gement SB 74 amends AS 47.07.030( d), requirin g the Department to establis h a primary care case manag ement syst em (PCCM) or a managed care organizat ion (MCO) contract to increase the use of appr opriate primary an d preventive care by Medicaid beneficiaries and decrease the unneces sary use of specialty care and hospital emergency department services. DHSS is directed to require Medicaid beneficiarie s with multiple h ospitalizat ions to enroll in the program, subject to some exceptions defined in the law. DHSS is required to integrate the PCCM system or MCO contract with the Coordinated Care Demonstration Projects establish ed under AS 47.07.039. Implementation Status: o Because SB 74 requires DHSS to integrate the PCCM system with the Coordinated Care Demonstration Projects established under AS 47.07.039, and because of the potential scope STATE OF ALASKA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MEDICAID COORDINATED CARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT 9 of the behavioral health system reforms, t he Department is implementing a temporary program to serve as a bridge to system -wide primary care case management. This approach will allow Coordinated Care Demonstration Projects and the behavioral health system reform initiative to develop and test new models of primary care case management and to be analyzed by the third -party actuary . o The temporary program involves expanding the current Alaska Medicaid Coordinated Care Initiative (AMCCI) contracts to include as many as 90,000 Medicaid recipients. The Department anticipates transitioning the AMCCI recipients to the new Coordinated Care Demonstration project(s) and behavioral health reform program when those are implemented. For more information on the AMCCI see the link at the end of this section. o Current DHSS Primary Care Case Management T imeline (subject to revision) : September - October 2016: Expand AMCCI contracts July 2017 - January 2018 : Transition affected Medicaid recipients from AMCCI to new demonstration projects. July 2018 - January 2019: Transition affected Medicaid recipients from AMCCI to Year 2 demonstration projects. Health Homes SB 74 adds AS 47.07.036(d), authorizing the Department to implement H ealth Home state Medicaid plan option services established under Section 1945 of the Social Security Act (SSA) (sometimes referred to as Section 2703 Health Homes for the section of the Affordable Care Act that added Section 1945 to the SSA) . Implementation Status: o The Department does not intend to begin planning for Health Home services until SFY 2018; howeve r, Coordinated Care Project Demonstration projects may propose to develop and pilot test a Health Home model, and other reform initiatives may choose to implement a Health Home model, earlier than that for specific populations. o Current DHSS Health Homes Timeline (s ubject to revision) : July 2017: Begin planning and development process for Health Homes. July 2019: Implement Health Homes state Medicaid plan amendment(s). Emergency Depa rtment (ED) Improvement Project SB 74 adds AS 47.07.038, which requires the Department to collaborate with the state hospital association to establis h a hospital-based project to reduce the use of emergency department services by Medicaid beneficiarie s. The statute stipulates tha t the hospital association will administer the project, and outlines a series of best practices for emergency departments that this project must address. DHSS is authorized by SB 74 to establis h a shar ed savings mechanis m with participating hospitals as part of t his project, subject to federal approval . Implementation Status: o The Department is currently participating in meetings organized by the Alaska State Hospital & Nursing Home Association and the state chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians. STATE OF ALASKA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MEDICAID COORDINATED CARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT 10 o Current DHSS ED Improvement Project Timeline (subject to revision) : August - December 2016: Collaborate with hospitals and ED physicians on development of required data systems. January - June 2017 : Collaborate with participating hospitals on the development of shared savings payment mo dels. Section 1915(i) and 1915(k) Home & Community Based Services SB 74 adds AS 47.07.036(d), authorizin g the Department to implement home and comm unity-based services authorized under sections 1915(i) and 1915(k) of the Social Security Act. These two service options may provide an opportunity for increasing federal reimbursement for services currently funded with state general fund dollars, and for filling gaps in services for certain populations. Implementation Status: o The Department contracted this past year with Health Management Associates (HMA) to analyze potential opportunities, costs, and savings associated with implementing these two service categories. The final report is scheduled to be released soon. o Current DHSS 1915(i) & 1915(k) Timeline (subject to revision) : October 2016: Release HMA 1915(i) & 1915(k) analysis and recommendations November - December 2016: Develop plan for implementing new home and community -based service options. Federal Policy on Tribal Medicaid Re imbursement SB 74 adds a new section to the uncodified law of the State of Alaska requiring the department to collaborate with Alaska tribal health organizations and the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services to fully implement changes in federal polic y that authorize 100 percent federal funding for services provided to American Indian and Alaska Native individuals eligible for Medicaid . The new federal policy allows the state to claim 100% federal reimbursement for Medicaid services provided to AI/AN Medicaid recipients in non -tribal facilities if the recipients' tribal health organization has a referral agreement established with the non -tribal facility. Implementation Status: o The Department is currently negotiating with CMS regarding the process r equirements for referral agreements between tribal and non -tribal providers and the associated systems for claiming 100% federal match for Medicaid services provided to tribal beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid. o Current DHSS Federal Policy on Tribal Reimb ursement Timeline (subject to revision) : July 2016 - June 2017: Implement tribal claiming systems for air and ground ambulance, transportation management, nursing facility, Residential Psychiatric Treatment Facility, and NICU/PICU services. July 2017 - June 2019: Implement tribal claiming systems for home and community based services; and for in -patient, specialty, and other medical services. Innovative Payment Models SB 74 adds AS 47.05.270(a), requirin g the Department to implement a program for reforming the state Me dicaid program and outlining a se ries of elements the program must include. One provision directs DHSS to redesign the payment process by implementing fee agreements that STATE OF ALASKA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MEDICAID COORDINATED CARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT 11 include: 1) premium payments for centers of excellence; 2) penalties for hospital-acquired infections, readmissions, and outcome failu res; 3) bundl ed payme nts for specific episodes of care; and/or 4) global payments for contracted payers, primary care managers, and case manag ers for a recipient or for care related to a specific diagnosis. Implementation Status: o The Department released an RFP on August 26 soliciting the services of a Medicaid payment reform and actuarial consultant to, in part, identify and analyze pote ntial innovative payment models . A link to this RF P is provided at the end of this Section. o Current DHSS Innovative Payment Model Timeline (subject to revision) : October 2016: Establish contract with payment reform and actuarial consultant October 2016 - June 2017: Identify and analyze potential innovative payment models, including those proposed through other reform initiatives. General 1115 Waiver Authority SB 74 adds AS 47.07.036(e), requir ing the Department to appl y for a section 1115 waiver under 42 U.S.C . 1315(a) to establish one or more demonstration projects focused on innovative payment models for one or more groups of Medicaid beneficiarie s in one or more specific geographi c areas. The demonstration projects may include manag ed care organizat ions, community care organizat ions, patient-centered medical homes, or other innovative payme nt models that ensure access to health care without reducing the quali ty of care. Implementation Status: o The Department may use this general waiver authority to implement a Coordinated Care Demonstration Project if necessary, but has no current plans to develop additional 1115 Waiver projects beyond the waiver planned for the behavioral health reform initiative . Stakeholde r Engagement in Medicaid Redesign Implementation The Department, with the support of the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority, currently has a contract with Agnew::Beck, LLC, to support a number of stakeholder engagement efforts, including: o Meetings with a Key Partners group, which includes representatives of major stakeholder groups and associations (will begin meeting in September); o Meetings of the six behavioral health 1115 waiver design teams (will begin meeting in September ); o Meetings of the Telehealth Workgroup (will begin meeting in October); o Meetings of the Quality & Cost -Effectiveness Targets Workgroup ( will begin meeting in October); and, o Public webinars to provide periodic updates on implementation (the first was held September 8 and is available on -line). The public may also submit comments and questions to Medicaid.Redesign@alaska.gov.
