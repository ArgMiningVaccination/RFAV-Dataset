They are designed to provide information and assist decision making. They are not intended to define a sta ndard of care and should not be construed as one. Neither should they be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. This Clinical Practice Guideline is based on a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological evidence. Develope d by a panel of multidisciplinary experts, it provides a clear explanation of the logical relationships between various care options and health outcomes while rating both the quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendation. Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when clinicians take into account the needs of individual patients, available resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Every healthcare professional making use of these guidelines is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in the setting of any particular clinical situation. These guidelines are not intended to represent Department of Veterans Affairs or TRICARE policy.

Introduction The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) Evidence -Based Practice Work Group (EBPWG) was established and first chartered in 2004, with a mission to advise the \"...Health Executive Council on the use of clinical and epidemiological evidence to improve the health of the population across the Veterans Health Administration and Military Health System,\" by facilitating the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the VA and DoD populations. [ ] This CPG is intended to p rovide healthcare providers with a framework by whic h to evaluate, treat, and manage the individual needs and preferences of pregnant women, thereby leading to improved clinical outcomes. 1 In 2009, the VA and DoD publis he d a CPG for the Management of Pregnancy (2009 Pregnancy CPG), which was based on evidence reviewed through December 2007. Since the release of that guideline, a growing body of research has expanded the general knowledge and understanding of pregnancy and its management. Consequently, a recommendation to update the 2009 Pregnancy CPG was initiated in 2016. The updated CPG includes objective, evidence -based information on the management of pregnancy. It is intended to assist healthcare providers in all aspects of care for a pregnant woman. The system -wide goal of developing evidence -based guidelines is to improve patients' health and well -being by guiding health care providers who are taking care of pregnant women along the management pathways that are supported by evidence. The expected outcome of successful implementation of this guideline is to: Assess the condition of the mother and baby and determine the best management method in collaboration with the mother and, when possible and desired, other family and caregivers Optimize the mother and baby's health outcomes and improve quality of life Minimize preventable complications and morbidity Emphasize the use of patient -centered care (PCC) II. Background A. Description of Pregnancy Pregnancy is the reproductive time during which a developing fetus grows inside of the uterus. It is a time of dramatic change for a developing fetus and a woman's body. Most pregnancies are uncomplicated and labor results in a normal vaginal birth with a healthy mother and baby. Rarely, complications arise, which have the potential to lead to lifelong implications. As the fetus continues to develop throughout the course of the pregnancy, the gestational age at birth can help predict outcomes ( ).[ ] Table 1 2-4 While pregnancy and birth are no rm al physiological events, pregnancy is a period of increased risk for a range of conditions. It is also a time of great interaction with the healthcare system, affording an opportunity to optimally manage chronic health conditions and provide preventative care. The healthcare team's goal is to maintain or improve the mother's health to foster normal and healthy development of the baby, culminating in a full -term birth . The physical, psychological, and social support that the mother receives during her pregnancy can help reduce health problems in her and the child's life. Evidence -based care during pregnancy can have a life -long impact on both mother and baby. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 7 of 147 Table 1. Gestational Age at Birth Predicts Offspring Outcomes [ ] 2-5 Term Gestational Age at Birth Outcomes Preterm <37 weeks Increased risk for adverse outcomes such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic Late preter m 34 0/7 - 36 6/7 weeks Decreased risk for adverse outcomes compared to other preterm infants, but increased risk for adverse outcomes compared to term infants Early -term 37 0/7 - 38 6/7 weeks Increased risk of adverse outcomes, particularly respiratory, compared to full-term infants Full-term 39 0/7 - 40 6/7 weeks Fully developed lungs, brains, and livers; have better health outcomes than infants born outside of this time period Late -term 41 0/7 -41 6/7 weeks Increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes compared to full -term infants Post -term >41 6/7 weeks Increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes compared to full -term infants B. Epidemiology and Impact in the General Population a. Rates of Reproduction In 2014, there were 3,978,497 registered births in the United States (U.S.). [ ] In general, between 1990 and 2 014, rates of reproduction in the U.S. have decreased. [ ] Women have also been giving birth at later age s. Mean age at first delivery inc reased from 24.9 years in 2000 to 26.3 years in 2014. Changes were most pronoun ced between 2009 and 2014. [ ] There are many possible drivers for the decrease in rates of re product ion in the past few decades and the increasing number of deliveries late r in women's lives, such as women's increasing prioritization on education and establishing careers prior to having children and improved access to contraception and reproductive health services. 6 7 8 b. Pregnancy Complications Although there have been advances in medicine and medical technologies over the past 25 years, maternal pregnancy -related mortality and morbidity have been increasing. Common complications that can occur during pregnancy include maternal obesity or excessive weight gain, mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), hyperemesis gravidarum, anemia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (e.g., gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia). [ ] 9 Pregnancy -relat e d deaths (approximately 600 each year) occur due to reasons such as heart conditions, infections, bleeding, blood clots, and high blood pressure triggered or exacerbated by pregnancy. Severe maternal morbidity affects approximately 65,000 women in the U.S. each year. The risk of morbidity doubled between 2000 and 2010 which is likely related to a number of factors, such as increased maternal age, pre -pregnancy obesity, preexisting chronic conditions, and an increasing number of cesarean deliveries. [ ] 10 Some complications that arise during pregnancy, such as ectopic pregnancy, may require immediate atte ntion while others are more chronic. Regardless of the type of complication, each requires the appropriate level of medical support, which may vary depending on the pregnant woman's current environment. Once a woman has delivered her baby, she may struggle with breastfeeding in the context of VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 8 of 147 unpredictable and demanding work schedules. Federal laws addressing breastfeeding in the workplace exist but are relatively new. [ ] 11 In contrast, the infant mortality rate has declined 15% between 2005 and 2015, from 6.86 infant deaths per 1,000 live births to 5.82. [ ] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated the follo wing were the five leading causes of infant death in 2014: [ ] 12 13 Birth defects Preterm birth or low birth weight Maternal complications of pregnancy Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) Unintentional injuries (e.g., accidental suffocation) Fro m 2005 to 2014, congenital malformations remained the leading cause of infant death, although congenital malformations declined by 11% during that pe riod. Preterm birth rates rose over 20% from 1990 (10.6%) through 2006 (12.8%). The preterm birth rate then declined from 2007 through 2014 from 10.4% to 9. 6%, but increased slightly to 9.6% in 2015. Increases in preterm births were seen among non- Hispanic black and Hispanic women. [] 14 Cesarean birth may be planned for breech presentation, prior uterine surgery, or as a response to unexpected maternal or fetal complications such as abnormal labor or a concerning fetal heart rate. [ ] Cesarean delivery is a m ajor surgery with associated risks (e.g., risk of infection, hemorrhage). Cesarean delivery requires a longer period for maternal recovery than vaginal birth and has also been a ssociated with neonatal complications, primarily respiratory. [ ] There has been a downward trend in cesarean bir ths between 2009 (32.9%) and 2015 (32.0%). The rate of low -risk cesarean births (defined as nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex cesarean deliveries to women having a first delivery ) also declined from 2009 (28.0%) to 2015 ( 25.8%). [ ] 15 15 16 C. Pregnancy in the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs Populations a. Location of Care This VA/DoD Pregnancy CPG is relevant to providers within the DoD and VA health care systems as well as in the broader community due to the way in which pregnancy care is provided through these systems. Pregnant Service Members and their dependent spouses can receive their pregnancy care through the DoD health care system or civilian providers within the community . As VA does not provide routine prenatal or pregnancy care on -site, pregnancy care is provided in the community via referral. Each VA medical center has a maternity care coordinator who fosters communication betw een the pregnant woman, non- VA providers, and the VA facility and who is responsible for monitoring care delivery, coordinating care, and tracking outcomes of VA -funded services. Due to the nature of the provision of pregnancy care, ongoing care coordination and communication between VA /DoD provide rs and any community obstetric providers is necessary to ensure that each Service Member and Veteran is receiving the care she needs and that all providers are fully aware of VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 9 of 147 information relevant to the pregnant woman's health and treatment plan. More information on this is available in the section on . Patient Focus Group Methods and Findings b. Rates of Reproduction Between 2003 and 2014, 174,921 infants were born to Active Duty Service Members. [ ] Recently, from 2012 -2016, annual prevalence of pregnancy -re lated events has decreased from 14.2% to 13.1%. The birth rate has also decreased from 69.8 live births per 1,000 person -years in 2012 to 59.7 live births per 1,000 person- years in 2016. [ ] Between 2003 and 2014, 1,043,812 infants were born to dependent spouses of A ctive Duty Service Members. [ ] 17 18 17 Between fiscal years 2000 and 2010, the VA covered an estimated total of 12,000 inpatient deliveries thro ugh community providers. Over this time period, the number of deliveries covered by the VA has increased from approximately 350 per year in 2000 to more than 2,000 per year in 2010. [ ] As the fe male, childbearing -age Veteran population increases, use of maternity and newborn care may also increase. 19 c. Complications Although women Service Members and Veterans experience some of the same challenges during pregnancy as women in the gene ral population, they also may have different challenges and pregnancy care needs than their civilian counterparts. Their service experience may have included involvement in combat or environmental/occupational exposures (e.g., fumes from burn pits, chemical toxicants). Service - related stressors such as tho se present in the lives of Service Members and Veterans may amplify the physical and psychological stresses of pregnancy. Although there is limited information regarding the impact of such exposures on reproductive health outcomes, the effort to assess the possible health impacts of military experience on women and their implications for obstetric healthcare is ongoing. [ ] 19 As in the general population, in some cases, births in Veterans and Service Members are affected by co mplications. The following data relates to complications experienced in pregnancies of Active Duty Service Members, which appear to be similar to those of the dependent spouses of Active Duty Service Members. [ , ] Between 2012 and 2016, pre -t erm labor, obesity related complications, 17.7%, 9.2%, 6.8%, and 6.3% of live births, respectively. Over the same time period, the percentage of live births affected by preeclampsia and GDM remained relatively stable, while the percentages of live births affected by preterm labor decreased and the percentage of live births affected by obesity -related complications increased. [ ] 1720 20 Pregnant Service Members and Veterans more commonly experience mental health issues than non - pr egnant Service Members and Veterans or pregnant women in the general population. In a study of mental health concerns among women Veterans between 2008 and 2012, anxiety, depression, and PTSD were twice as likely among those receiving pregnancy care as those without a pregnancy. [ ] Being re moved from their support network for military service during deployments and military assignments may also affect mental he alth outcomes of pregnant Service Members . Nearly one in eight women in the military (compared to approximately one in nine in the general population) develop postpartum depression, possibly reflecting disrupted social support. Postpartum depression can , in turn, be 21VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 10 of 147 complicated by other psychosocial factors, such as poor relationship satisfaction and low self- esteem. [ ] 22-24 Other VA/DoD CPGs provide guidance regarding care for the following conditions: Screening and Management of Obesity and Overweight (VA/DoD Obesity CPG)1 Management of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder (VA/DoD PTSD CPG)2 Management of Major Depressive Disorder (VA/DoD MDD CPG)3 III. About this Clinical Practice Guideline This guideline represents an important step toward improving the treatment and management of pregnant women in the VA and DoD. As with other CPGs, however, challenges remain, including evidence gaps, the need to develop effective strategies for guideline implementation, and the need to evaluate the effect of guideline adherence on clinical outcomes. This guideline is intended for VA and DoD healthcare practitioners including primary care providers, obstetricians, gynecologists, nurses, nurse practitioners, care coordinators , midwives, mental health practitioners, cardiologists, dietitians , breastfeeding/lactation specialists, physical therapists, and others involved in the care of pregnant Service Members or Veterans. As elaborated upon in the q ualifying statement on page one, this CPG is not intended to serve as a standard of care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and practice patterns evolve. This CPG is based on information available through May 2017 and is intended to provide a general guide to best practices. The guideline can assist care providers, but the use of a CPG must always be considered as a recommendation, within the context of a provider's clinical judgment and patient values and preferences, for the care of an individual patient. A. Methods The current document is an update to the 2009 Pregnancy CPG. The methodology used in developing the 2018 CPG follows the Guideline for Guidelines ,[ ] an internal document of the VA and DoD EBPWG . The Guideline for Guidelines ca n be downloaded from . This doc ument provides information regarding the process of developing guidelines, including the identification and as sembly of the Guideline Champions (Champions) and other subject matter experts from within the VA and DoD, known as the Work Group and, ul timately, the development and submission of a new or updated Pregnancy CPG. 1 http://www.healthquality.va.gov/policy/index.asp The Champions and Work Group for this CPG were charged with developing evidence -base d clinical practice recommendations and writing and publishing a guideline document to be used by providers 1 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of Obesity and Overweight. Available at: https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/CD/obesity/ 2 See the VA/D oD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder. Available at: https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/MH/ptsd/ 3 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Major Depressive Disorder. Available at: https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/MH/mdd/VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 11 of 147 within the VA/DoD healthcare system s as well as those within the community who treat individuals within the VA and DoD . Specifically, the Champions and Work Group members for this guideline were responsible for identifying the key questions (KQs) of the most clinical relevance, importance, and interest for the management of pregnant women . The Champions and the Work Group also provided direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria for the evidence review and assessed the level and quality of the evidence. The a mount of new scientific eviden ce that had accumulated since the previous version of the CPG was also taken into consideration in the identification of the KQs. In addition, the Champions assisted in: Identifying appropriate disciplines of individuals to be included as part of the Work Group Directing and coordinating the Work Group Participating throughout the guideline development and review processes T he VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, in collaboration with the Office of Evidence Based Practice, U.S. Army Medical Command, the proponent for CPGs for the DoD, identified four clinical leaders, Heather Able, MSN, RNC and Alicia Christy, MD, MHSCR, FACOG from the VA and COL Lisa Foglia, MD , FACOG and Lt Col Barton Staat, M D, FACOG from the DoD, as Champions for the 201 8 CPG. The Lewin Team, including The Lewin Group, Duty First Consulting, ECRI Institute, and Sigma Health Consulting, LLC, was contracted by the VA and DoD to support the development of this CPG and conduct the evidence review. The first conference call was held in October 2016, with participation from the contracting officer's representative (COR), leaders from the VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value and the DoD Office of Evidence Based Practice, and the C hampions. During this call, participants discussed the scope of the guideline initiative, the roles and responsibilities of the Champions, the project timeline, and the approach for developing and prioritizing specific research questions on which to base a systematic review (SR) about the management of pregnancy. The group also identified a list of clinical specialties and areas of expertise that are important and relevant to the management of pregnancy, from which Work Group members were recruited. The spe cialties and clinical areas of interest included: breastfeeding/lactation, care coordination, cardiology, clinical psychology, dietetics , family medicine, gynecology, internal medicine, mental health, midwifery, nursing, nutrition, obstetrics, psychiatry, women's health, and physical therapy. The guideline development process for the 201 8 CPG update consisted of the following steps: 1. Formulating and prioritizing KQs 2. Convening patient focus groups 3. Conducting the systematic evidence review 4. Convening a face -to-face meeting with the CPG Champions and Work Group members 5. Drafting and submitting a final CPG on the management of pregnancy to the VA/DoD EBPWG Appe ndix A provides a detailed description of each of these tasks. a. Grading Recommendations The Champions and Work Group used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a strength for each VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 12 of 147 recommendation. The GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each recommendation:[ ] 25 Balan ce of desirable and undesirable outcomes Confidence in the quality of the evidence Patient or provider values and preferences Other implications, as appropriate, e.g.,: Resource use Equity Acceptability Feasibility Subgroup considerations U sing these four domains, the Work Group determined the r elative strength of each recommendation (\"Strong\" or \"Weak\"). A \"Strong\" recommendation generally indicates a high confidence in the quality of the available scientific evidence, a clear difference in magnitude between the benefits and harms of an interven tion, similar patient or provider values and preferences, and understood influence of other implications (e.g., resource use, feasibility). If the Work Group has less confidence after the assessment across these domains and believes that additional evidence may change the recommendation, it generally assigns a \"Weak\" recommendation. It is important to note that the GRADE terminology used to indicate the assessment across the four domains (i.e., Strong vs. Weak) should not be confused with the clinical impor tance of the recommendation. A weak recommendation may still be important to the clinical care of a pregnant patient. Occasionally, instances may occur when the Work Group feels there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against a particular therapy or preventive measure. This can occur when there is an absence of studies on a particular topic that met evidence review inclusion criteria, studies included in the evidence review report conflicting results, or studies included in the evide nce review report inconclusive results regarding the desirable and undesirable outcomes. Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum: Strong for (or \"We recommend offering this option ...\") Weak for (or \"We sug gest offering this option ...\") No recommendation for or against (or \"There is insufficient evidence...\") Weak against (or \"We suggest not offering this option ...\") Strong against (or \"We recommend against offering this option ...\") T he grade of each recommendation made in the 201 8 CPG can be found in the section on . Addi tional information regarding the use of the GRADE system can be found in . Re commendations Appe ndix AVA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 13 of 147 b. Reconciling 2009 Clinical Practice Guideline Recommendations Evidence -based CPGs should be current, which typically requires revisions of previous guidelines based on new evidence, or as scheduled and subject to time -based expirations. [ ] For example, the U.S. Pr eventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has a process for refining or otherwise updating its recommendations perta ining to preventive services.[ ] Further, the inclusion criteria for the National Guideline Clearinghouse spec ify that a guideline must have been developed, reviewed, or revised within the past five years. 25 26 The Pregnancy Guide line Work Group focused largely on developing new and updated recommendations based on the evidence review conducted for the priority areas addressed by the KQs. In addition to those new and updated recommendations, the Work Group considered, without complete review of the relevan t evidence, the current applicability of other recommendations that we re included in the previous 2009 Pregnancy CPG, subject to evolving practice in today's environment. A set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). [ , ] These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to acco unt for the various ways in which older reco mmendations could have been updated. In br ief, the categories took into account whether or not the evidence that related to a recommendation was systematically reviewed, the degree to which the recommendation was modified, and the degree to which a recommendation is relevant in the current care en vironment and within the scope of the CPG. Additional information regarding these categories and their definitions can be found in . The categories for the reco mme nda tions included in the 201 8 version of the guideline can be found in the section on . The categories for t he reco mmendations carried forward from the 2009 Pregnancy CPG are noted in . . 2728 Recommendation Categorization Recommendations Appendix D The CPG Work Group recognized the need to accommodate the transition in evidence rat ing sy stems from the 2009 Pregnancy CPG to the current CPG. In order to report the strength of all recommendations using a consistent format (i.e., the GRADE s ystem) the CPG Work Group converted the USPSTF strengths of the recommendation accompanying the carryover recommendations from the 2009 guideline to the GRADE system. As such, the CPG Work Group considered the strength of the evidence cited for each recomm endation in the 2009 Pregnancy CPG as well as the intervention's harms and benefits, values and preferences, and other implications, where possible. The CPG Work Group referred to the available evidence as summarized in the body of the 2009 Pregnancy CPG a nd did not systematically re -assess the evidence. In some instances, relevant peer -reviewed literature published since the 2009 Pregnancy CPG was considered along with the original evidence base for the specific recommendation . Where such newer literature was considered when converting the strength of the recommendation from the USPSTF to the GRADE system, it is referenced in the discussion that follows the corresponding recommendation, as well as in Appendix C The CPG Work Group recognizes that, while there are sometimes prac tical reasons for incorporating findings from a previous SR, previous recommendations, [ ] or recent peer -re viewed publications into an updated CPG, doing so does not invo lve an original, comprehensive SR and, therefore, may introduce bias. 29VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 14 of 147 c. Peer Review Process The CPG was developed through an iterative process in which the Work Group produced multiple drafts of the CPG. The process for developing the initial draft is described in more detail in . Drafting and Submitting the Final Clinical Practice Guideline Once a near- final draft of the guideline was agreed upon by the Champions and Work Group members, the draft was sent out for peer review and comment. The draft was posted on a wiki website for a period of 14 business days. The peer reviewers comprised individuals working within the VA and DoD healthcare systems as well as experts from relevant outside organizations designated by the Work Group members. Organizations designated by the Work Group to participate in the peer review and who provided feedback include the following: Albany Medical Center American Co llege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Tufts Medical Center Th e VA and DoD Leadership reached out to both the internal and external peer reviewers to solicit their feedback on the CPG. Reviewers were provided a hyperlink to the wiki website where the draft CPG was posted. All feedback from the peer reviewers was discussed and considered by the Work Group. Modifications made throughout the CPG development process were made in accordance with the evidence. B. Summary of Patient Focus Group Methods and Findings When forming guideline recommendations, consideration should be given to the values of those most affected by the recommendations: patients. Patients bring perspectives, values, and preferences into their healthcare experience that can vary from those of clinicians. These differences can affect decision m aking in various situations, and should thus be highlighted and made explicit due to their potential to influence a recommendation's implementation. [ , ] Focus groups can be used as an efficient method to explore i deas and perspectives of a group of ind ividuals and collect qualitative data on a thoughtfully predetermined set of questions. 3031 Therefore, as part of the effort to update this CPG, VA and DoD Leadership, along with the Pregnancy CPG Wo rk Group, held two patient focus groups. The first was h eld on December 1, 2016 at the Washington DC VA Medical Center in Washington, DC. The second was held on February 2, 2017 at Malco lm Grow Medical Clinics and Surgery Center at Joint Base Andrews, MD. The aim of the focus groups was to further understand and incorporate the perspective of pregnant women covered and/or receiving their care through the VA and/or DoD healthcare systems during their pregnancy and perinatal period, as pregnant women are those most affected by the CPG. The focus groups delved into the patients' perspectives on a set of topics related to their pregnancy care, including their priorities, challenges they have ex perienced, and the information they received regarding their pregnancy care, as well as the impacts of their pregnancy and their pregnancy care on their lives. It is important to note the focus groups comprised a convenience sample and the Work Group reco gnizes the lack of generalizability and other limitations inherent in the small sample size. Less than 10 people in VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 15 of 147 total were included in two focus groups to be consistent with the requirements of the federal Paperwork Reduction Act, 1980. The Work Group acknowledges that the sample of pregnant women included in these focus groups is not representative of all pregnant women within the VA and DoD healthcare systems. Further, time limitations for the focus group s prevented exhaustive exploration of all topics related to pregnancy care in the VA and DoD and the women's broader experiences with their care. Thus, the Work Group made decisions regarding the priority of topics to discuss at the focus group s. These limitations, as well as others, were considered du ring guideline development as the information collected from the discussion was being used. Recruitment for participation in the focus groups was managed by the Champions and VA and DoD Leadership, with assistance from coordinators at the facilit ies at which the focus groups took place. The following concepts are ideas and suggestions about aspects of care that are important to pregnant women and emerged as recurring themes during the discussions ( ) . These concepts were important par ts of the participants' care and added to the Work Group's understanding of patient values and pers pectives. Additional details regarding the patient focus group methods and findings can be found in . Table 2 Appendix B Table 2. Preg nancy CPG Focus Group Concepts Pregnancy CPG Focus Group Concepts A. Recognize the importance of a support network throughout pregnancy, including as a trusted source of information specific to a patient's unique pregnancy experience (e.g., as a first -time parent or Active Duty Service Member) B. Provide information regarding general pregnancy care to the patient in a timely manner and in a way that is responsive to the patients' goals, values, and preferences C. Provide comprehensive, understandable information regarding covered services to the patient and help the patient navigate that information and answer questions as needed D. Recognize the importance of the relationship between the pa tient and her provider and care team and the necessity for the patient to have consistency in this relationship and her access to care E. Ensure that the family is involved in the pregnancy in accordance with patient preferences and recogniz e the differences among families in structure and composition F. Ensure that patients know the options for pediatric healthcare and day care early in their pregnancy and provide information so that they can feel secure in their planning G. Improve communication and information sharing between VA and community providers to ensure patients receive the individualized care they need without undue stress C. Conflicts of Interest At the start of this guideline development process and at other key points throughout, the project team was required to submit disclosure statements to reveal any areas of potential conflict of interest (COI) in the past 24 months. Verbal affirmations of no COI were used as necessary during meetings throughout the guideline development proces s. The project team was also subject to random web -based surveillance (e.g., Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services open payments or ProPublica). If a project team member reported a COI (actual or potential), then it was reported to the Office of Evidence Based Practice. It was also discussed with the Pregnancy CPG Champions in tandem with their review of the evidence and development of recommendations. The Office of Evidence Based Practice and the Pregnancy CPG Champions determined whether or not acti on, such as restricting participation and/or VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 16 of 147 voting on sections related to the conflict or removal from the Work Group, was necessary. If it was deemed necessary, action to mitigate the COI was taken by the Champions and Office of Evidence B ased Practice , based on the level and extent of involvement. No conflicts of interest were identified for the Pregnancy CPG Work Group members or Champions. Disclosure forms are on file with the Department of Veterans Affairs Evidence Based Practice Program office and available upon request. D. Scope of this Clinical Practice Guideline Regardless of setting, any patient in the healthcare system should ideally have access to the interventions that are recommended in this guideline after taking into consideration the patient's specific circumstances. Guideline recommendations are intended to be patient -centered. Thus, treatment and care should take into account a patient's needs and preferences. Good communication between healthcare professionals and the patient is essential and should be supported by evidence -based information tailored to the patient's needs. Use of an empathetic and non- judgmental approach facilitates discussions sensitive to gender, culture, ethnic, and other differences. The information that patients are given about treatment and care should be culturally appropriate and also available to people with limited literacy skills. It should also be accessible to people with additional needs such as physical, sensory, or learning disabilities. Family involvement should be considered, if appropriate. This CPG is designed to assist providers in managing or co -managing pregnant women as well as co- occurring conditions (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, diabetes mellitus [DM] ). Moreover, the patient populatio n of interest for this CPG is pregnant women who are eligible for care in the VA and DoD healthcare delivery systems. It includes Veterans as well as deployed and non -deployed Active Duty Service, Guard, and Reserve Members and their dependents. E. Highlighted Features of this Clinical Practice Guideline The 201 8 edition of the VA/DoD Pregnancy CPG is the second update to the original CPG. It provides practice recommendations for the care of women with uncomplicated pregnancies as well as guidance fo r specialty referral. A particular strength of this CPG is the multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement from its inception, ensuring representation from the broad spectrum of clinicians engaged in the treatment and management of pregnant women with and without co -occurring conditions. The framework for recommendations in this CPG considered factors beyond the strength of the evidence, including balancing desired outcomes with potential harms of the intervention, equity of resource availability, the potential for variation in patient values and preferences , and other considerations (e.g., resource use, subgroup considerations) as appropriate. Applicability of the evidence to VA/DoD populations was also taken into consideration. A n algorithm , in the fo rm of a table, accompanies the guideline to provide an overview of the recommendations in the context of the flow of patient care and to assist with training providers (see the section ). The algorithm may be used to help facilitate t ranslation of guideline recommendations into effective practice. A lgorithm F. Patient -centered Care VA/DoD CPGs encourage clinicians to u se a PCC approach that is individualized based on patient needs, characteristics , experience with previous preg nancies, and preferences. Regardless of setting, all patients VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 17 of 147 in the healthcare system should be able to access evidence -based care appropriate to that patient . When properly executed, PCC may decrease patient anxiety, increase trust in clinician s,[ ] and improve t reatment adherence. [ ] Improved patient -c linician communication and a PCC approach conv eys openness and sup po rts disclosure of current and future concerns. 32 33 As part of the PCC approach, clinicians should review the outcomes of previous healthcare ex periences with the pregnant woman. They should ask each pregnant woman about any concerns she has or barriers to high quality care she might experience . Lastly, they should educate the pregnant women on the actions that need to be taken and any decisions that need to be made and should involve the woman in decision making regarding management of pregnancy. Healthcare coverage may factor into a pregnant woman's d ecision making process regarding her care. However, healthcare coverage for each woman may vary. Therefore, it may be helpful for pregnant women to discuss their coverage with the appropria te VA or DoD representative. Pregnant women who obtain their healthcare coverage through the VA should talk to their Maternity Care Coordinator. Pregnant women who obtain their healthcare coverage through the DoD should talk to their TRICARE representative . G. Shared Decision Making Throughout this VA/DoD CPG, the authors encourage clinicians to focus on shared decision making (SDM). The SDM model was introduced in Crossing the Quality Chasm, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now called the Natio nal Academy of Medicine [NAM] ) report , in 2001. [ ] It is readily apparent that pregnant w omen , together with their clinicians, make decisions regarding the ir plan of care and management options . Pregnant women require sufficient information and time to be able to make informed decisions. Clinicians must be adept at presenting information to their patients regarding individual treatments, expected outcomes, and levels and/or locations of care . During pregnancy, this includes presenting the mother, and her support system as appropriate, information about maternal and fetal risks of untreated symptoms and maternal and fetal benefits and risks of proposed care . Clinicians are encouraged to use SDM to individualize treatment goals and plans based on patient capabilities, needs, goals, prior preg nancy experience, and preferences. 34 H. Co-occurring Conditions Co-occurring medical and mental health conditions are important to recognize because they can modify the management of pregnancy, patient or provider treatment priorities, clinical decisions, an d the provider with which pregnancy and ongoing healthcare will be provided. Providers should expect that many pregnant Veterans , Service Members , and their family will have one or more co -occurring health conditions . Because of the nature of pregnancy care, which sometimes takes place in parallel with ongoing care for co -occurring conditions, it is generally best to manage pregnancy in collaboration with the care for other health conditions that are being treated in primary or specialty care. Some co -occurring medical or mental health conditions may require early specialist consultation in order to discuss any necessary changes in treatment due to pregnancy or to establish a common understanding of how care will be coordinated and delivered.

Implemen tation This CPG and algorithm are designed to be adapted by individual healthcare providers with consideration of local needs and resources. The algorithm serve s as a tool to prompt providers to consider key decision points in the course of an episode of c are. Although this CPG represents the recommended practice on the date of its publication, medical practice is evolving and this evolution requires continuous updating based on published information. N ew technology and more research will improve patient c are in the future. The CPG can assist in identifying priority areas for research and inform ing optimal allocation of resources. Future studies examining the results of CPG implementation may lead to the development of new evidence particularly relevant to clinical practice .

Standard of Pregnancy Care Some aspects of pregnancy care, although clinically important and part of the generally accepted standard of pregnancy care , do not have sufficient high -quality evidence to support a stand- alone recommendation. In many cases, clinical studies assessing the efficacy of these standards of pregnancy care do not exist because they are determined to be routine actions and it would be unethical to withhold them from pregnancy women in order to conduct a clinical trial ( e.g., administration of rhesus [Rh] immune globulin) . This is true for actions that are to be completed at every visit ( ), certain screenings, and other time -se nsitive care. Ac tions at Every Visit a.Additional Information on Actions at Every Visit Vital Signs Vital signs, such as measuring blood pressure, calculating BMI, and weighing a pregnant woman at each prenatal visit, is the standard of care in VA, DoD, and in the community. High blood pressure in pregnancy may lead to life -threatening maternal and fetal outcomes. Routinely measuring blood pressure is useful in detecting and managing gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and pre -existin g hypertension in pregnant women. The USPSTF determined that the best strategy for preventing preeclampsia in pregnancy is early detection through routine blood pressure screening. [ ] A pregnant woman's blood pressure s hould be measured at every v isit. 35 Assessing weight and calculating BMI for p regnant women at every visit gives the provider an opportunity to offer interventions that can improve both obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. Women who are overweight or obese are at greater risk for adverse health conditions during the preconception, antepartum, and postpartum periods. Women with low BMI are also at risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Inadequate weight gain is a risk factor for spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, fetal growth r estriction, hypertensive disorders, and poor perinatal outcomes. Women with anorexia nervosa may be identified by a low initial BMI and/or inadequate antepartum weight gain. [ ] This screening is p articularly important in the military and Veteran population, as studies have suggested that this popul ation may be at greater risk for BMI -associated obstetrical complications. [ ] More information r egarding recommended weight gain can be found in and . 36 37 Table 3 Table 4 Table 3. Weight Gain Recommendations for Singletons [ ] 38 Pre-pregnancy Weight (BMI in kg/m2) Recommended Gain meter(s) VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 24 of 147 Table 4.

When multiple providers are co -managing a pregnant woman, as in the case of VA and some DoD pregnant women, it is important to identify, address , and document medications. The CDC has partnered with other federal agencies and non -federal partners to improve the health of women and babies by working to identify the safest treatment options for the management of common conditions before and during pregnancy. [ ] Pregnant women, in c ollaboration with their trusted providers and pharmacists, are highly motivated to protect developing babies from potential harms of med ication use during pregnancy while maintaining optimal health .[ ] 39 39 b.Screenings Dental Care Periodontal disease, although common during pregnancy, is both preventable and curable. While recommendations for treatment of periodontal disease cannot be endorsed specifically at this time for the purpose of decreasing adverse f etal and maternal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, low birth weight, pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, GDM), several studies have shown there may be an association between periodontal disease and increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. [ , ] Pregnancy is not a co ntraindication to most dental services, though some procedures requiring general anesthesia may be defe rred to the postpartum period. [ ] Oral health care is not only a component of a healthy pregnancy, but e vidence suggests that most infants and young children acquire caries -caus ing bacteria from their mothers. [ ] Routine dental care, including x -rays (with proper anatomic shielding) and periodontal therapy, along with good oral hygiene, should be encouraged throughout preg nancy .[ , ] 4041 42 43 4344 Immunizations It is important that all pregnant and breastfeeding women are immunized according to current CDC schedules for vaccination . Maternal immunizations decrease the risk of life - or fetus -threatening diseases during pregnancy. Pregnant women are relatively immunocompromised and can be severely affected by influenza and other infectious pathogens. Immunizations help protect the mother from infection. They also enhance passive immunity of infants to pathogens that cause life -threatening illnesses. Safe immunization options during pr egnancy are available, namely: p ertussis, influenza, varicella, and rubella. Some patients may have concerns about the safety of vaccination in pre gnancy; ther efore, providers should be well -versed in the safety and benefits of vaccine administration. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 25 of 147 Pertussis: Also known as whooping cough, pertussis is a highly contagious bacterial disease that can cause coughing and difficulty breathing. Pertussis poses a significant burden on infants and can be very serious or deadly, especially in those younger than one year. Pregnant women should receive the Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced tetanus, diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis) vaccine during each pregnancy to provide passive immunity to infants, who would not otherwise routinely receive it until two months of age. [ ] Although a pregnant woman can receive the Tdap vaccine at any time during pregnancy, the optimal time to receive the vaccine is from 27 -36 weeks gestation, maximizing maternal antibody response a nd passive antibody transfer to the newborn. Women who do not receive Tdap during pregnancy should receive the vaccine in the immediate postpartum period. Furthermore, all caregivers, family, or others who will have direct contact with the newborn should be immunized. [ ] 45 45 Influenza: Women who acquire influenza durin g pregnancy may experience increased morbidity and even death, with a possible increased spontaneous abortion rate. [ ] For this reason, all women who are pregnant during influenza season should receive the influenza vaccine (an inactivated virus). According to the CDC, influenza vaccination is safe for both the mo ther and the fetus, regardless of gestational age. The influenza immunization has also been proven to be protective to both the mother and her baby from influenza for several months after birth. [ ] 46 47 Varicella: Women with varicella infection during pregnancy h ave a 10 -20% risk of developing pneumonia, a significant risk factor for maternal mortality, which is estimated to be as high as 40%. [ ] In pregnancy, varicella may cross the placenta resulting in congenital or neonatal varicella infection. Maternal infection in the first half of pregnancy has been associated with congenital varicella syndrome. [ ] Neonatal varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection is associated with a high neonatal death rate. [ , ] 48 49 50 ] Routine screening for varicella should be conducted through obtaining the mother's history. If there is a negative/uncertain history of prior disease or vaccination status, a varicella titer should be obtained. If the mother is non -immune, a vaccination should be offered during the postpartum period. The vaccine is contraindicated during pregnancy. [ 5152 Rubella: Infection in the first 16 weeks of pregnancy can cause miscarriage or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). [ ] Due to concerns about possible teratogenicity, the measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccinati on is not recommended during pregnancy. [ , ] Women who are not immune to rubella should be vaccinated before leaving the hospital after delivery. 53 5455 Infectious Diseases Screening for infectious diseases during pregnancy per current guidance from the CDC is recommended. Appropriate follow -up treatment and/or prophylaxis treatment depending upon the history, known exposure, and symptoms of infectious disease is necessary. This includes: Gonorrhea Chlamydia Syphilis Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 26 of 147 Hepatitis B virus Rubella Human papillomavirus virus (HPV) (if there is a history of an abnormal cervical screen) Herpes simplex virus (HSV) Group B streptococcus (GBS) Infe ctious diseases during pregnancy can c ause significant mortality and morbidity in both the mother and the fetus. According to the CDC, screening for infectious diseases, counseling, and treatment can improve maternal and fetal outcomes. [] 56 GBS infections are the leading cause of serious neonatal infections (e.g., sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia) with in the first seven days of life (early -onset infection). Universal screening at 35 -37 weeks gestation with a single vaginal swab and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis continues to be the standard. Because new exposures and infectious agents can emerge (such as Zika virus), it is important to refer to the most recent CDC guidance. Screening can lead to diagnosis in asymptomatic women and allow pregnant women an opportunity to be treated. Vitamins We suggest daily multivitamins to be taken starting one month before conception and continued throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding. Women in the U.S. commonly supplement their diet with vitamins and minerals during pregnancy. Supplementation with multivitamins and minerals have also been associated with improved outcomes. See for additional information on folate suppl ementation. Supp lementation with multivitamins was found to lower the risk of preeclamp sia and three forms of childhood cancer (pediatric brain tumors, neuroblastomas, and leukemia). [ , ] The Oper ation Supplement Safet y webs ite ( ) provides additional information that may be useful for patients regarding use of supplements during pregnancy and lactation, as well as information for wome n who may not be pregnant but who are planning to become pregnant or are of childbearing age.[ , ] Rec ommendation 4 5758 www.opss.org 5960 Nutrition We suggest that pregnant women on restrictive diets (e.g., vegeta rians, bariatric surgery) consult with a dietitian. Though there is no consensus on the necessary requirements for patients both pre - and post - bariatric surgery, it is a generally accepted standard of practice for surgeons and dietitians to follow up with these patients to monitor for surgical complications as well as nutritional adequacy and any potential deficiencies associated with the procedure. In addition to post -bariatric pregnant women, others with higher risk of nutritional complications include th ose who: Are vegetarian or vegan Avoid certain foods (e.g., due to food allergies, cultural reasons, fad diets) Are breastfeeding while pregnant Are underweight with a BMI <18.5 kg/m2 VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 27 of 147 Are <17 years old Have a multiple gestation pregnancy Have a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, DM, or GDM Have an eating disorder Are identified as food insecure (food insecurity is defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a household -level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food [ ])61 T he Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) recommends screening for the aforementioned nutritional ri sks and subsequent a ssessment by a Registered Dietit ian Nutritionist (RDN) to evaluate the pregnant woman for nutritional adequacy during this phase of life. [ ] Appo intments with RDNs may not be feasible at all locations but tele -me dical nutrition therapy may be a cost -effective option in some instances. 62 Intimate Partner Violence Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a high -prevalence and high -risk problem that may be first identified during pregnancy, therefor e routine screening during pregnancy is indicated. Risks of IPV during pregnancy include preterm birth, low birth weight, and decreased gestational age. In addition, a history of IPV is associated with higher rates of chronic pain, neurologic disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and psychiatric disorders. [ ] Although there is strong evidence for the utility of screening, there is no e vidence regarding optimal screening times or intervals. 63 The 5 -item E xtended - Hurt, Insult, Threaten, Scream (E- HITS ) tool has been found to be an effective screening method, with high levels of sensitivity and specificity. [ , ] The items are included below. 6364 I n the past year, how often did a current or former intimate partner (e.g., boyfriend, girlfriend, wife, husba nd, sexual partner): 1. Physically hurt you 2. Insult or talk down to you 3. Threaten you with harm 4. Scream or curse at you 5. Force you to have sexual activities R esponses for each item are on a 5 -point scale: Never (1), Rarely (2), Sometimes (3), Often (4), Frequently (5). A score of 7 or higher is considered positive for IPV, with clinician judgment recommended for a score of 6. For women who screen positive, we recommend completing an assessment and providing information, intervention , and/or referrals as needed. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 28 of 147 c. Time Sensitive Care Fetal Anatomy Scan We suggest offering a complete fetal anatomy ultrasound to all pregnant women. Optimal timing of this complete fetal anatomy ultrasound is in the second trimester between 18 and 22 weeks of gestation. [65,66] Routine screening provides a more accurate gestational age assessment (with subsequent lower incidence of induction for post -term pregnancy), earlier detection of multiple gestations, and greater detection of unsuspected fetal abnormalities (with subsequent increased terminations).[ 67] A complete obstetric sonographic examination should be available to all women, including those considering an invasive test.[ 68,69] Fetal Presentation Fetal presentation should be assessed at 36 weeks gestation in order to determine the need for further treatment. [70] If non- cephalic presentation is suspected, it should be confirmed with ultrasound. [71 ] Once confirmed, a consultation with the appropriate obstetrical provider should be made immediately to discuss external cephalic version to correct malpresentation. [72,73] Potential benefits of appropriate management of pregna ncy would include improved vaginal delivery rates and decreased maternal harm from cesarean delivery. Postpartum Visit All women should have a postpartum visit, optimally within six weeks, and no later than eight weeks, after delivery. Postpartum follow -up is specifically encouraged for women who experienced complications during pregnancy, such as hypertensive diseases, gestational and non-gestational DM, and depression. Women with a history of GDM are at increased risk of developing type 2 DM . See the VA/ DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care (VA/DoD DM CPG) for more information on diagnostic techniques.4 Women with hypertensive and metabolic diseases of pregnancy may have increased risk of long -term health problems, particularly lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) . Thus, more accurate diagnosis of conditions such as impaired glucose tolerance has become even more crucial. The obstetric provider should begin the implementation of an individua l risk -based surveillance strategy at the postpartum visit, which can be transitioned to the woman's long- term primary care provider. Benefits to the mother may include early identification of health conditions and early initiation of appropriate managemen t methods. During this postpartum visit the provider may also assess contraception initiation, breastfeeding , and mental health disorders. d. Summary These assessments and care management methods, including actions completed at every visit, screenings , and time sensitive care , have become the standard of pregnancy care. When combined, all of these factors will help providers determine the appropriate management of pregnancy, potentially including a consult to an advanced prenatal care provider ( e.g., ob stetrician or maternal-fetal medicine ) or another referral as indicated. 4 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Gu ideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care.

Routine Pregnancy Care The CPG does not address every aspect of routine care. The below information can be used to help guide clinicians during the routine aspects of management of pregnancy.

Routine Care During Pregnancy Recommendation 1. We suggest offering a group model of prenatal care as an acceptable alternative to individual provider appointments. (We ak for | Not reviewed, Amended) Discussion The 2009 CPG recommended a group model of prenatal care as an acceptable alternative to individual provider appointments based on two studies. [74,75] One study, in a university -based setting, demonstrated that women assigned to group prenatal care were less likely to experience preterm delivery than those receiving standard prenatal care. [ 74] A recent meta -analysis of group prenatal care versus traditional prenatal care did not find significant benefits to group prenatal care over traditional prenatal care. [76] However, the study found a potential risk reduction of preterm delivery in African American women and did not find any evidence of harm through participation in group prenatal care. A limitation of this meta- analysis is that a variety of other important outcomes such as patient satisfaction, contraception initiation, and depression were not examined. A group model of prenatal care may fit better with the values and preferences of some pregnant women than the individual model. Patient preferences and values, as well as competing issues such as child care, may affect a woman's choice to pursue individualized care versus care in a group setting. The presence of medical or pregnancy complications may also influence a woman's decision to pursue group prenatal care. As this is a Not reviewed, Amended recommenda tion, the Work Group did not systematically review evidence related to this recommendation. Based on the assessment of the quality of the evidence put forth in the 2009 Pregnancy CPG, [74,75 ] the Work Group de termined the evidence to be moderate quality for offering a group model of prenatal care as an alternative to individual provider appointments. Other support for this recommendation stemmed from the benefits outweighing the harms of offering a group model of prenatal care as an alternative to an individual model. Recommendation 2. We recommend that all healthy, pregnant women without known contraindications participate in regular mild to moderate exercise sessions, three or more times per week. (S trong for | Reviewed, Amended) Discussion Moderate level evidence shows that healthy pregnant women benefit most from completing at least 150 minutes per week of mild to moderate intensity exercise, with limited risk to mother and baby. [77] Studies included in the evidence review overwhelmingly used three or more sessions per week. [77-82] In an SR by Harrison et al. (2016) outcomes overall seemed to improve with exercise of greater frequency and/or intensity with some form of supervision for the purposes of improving adherence. [80] In another SR, by Aune et al. (2016), the minimum exercise frequency studied was one time per week to provide sufficientVA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 37 of 147 stimulus or aerobic effect with no exercise as the control. [78] Therefore, for better outcomes, providers should encourage women to exercise three or more times per week at an intensity level of mild to moderate for at least 20 minutes per day, with a goal of 150 minutes per week. Less than 20 minutes per day has not been shown to benefit mother or baby. [ 78] Women with healthy pregnancies can continue their pre -pregnancy exercise routine throughout pregnancy. Previously sedentary women can slowly start a new exercise routine during pregnancy, consisting of aerobic exercise and strength training, without increase risk of preterm birth or shortening gestational age at birth .[77 ] Women should be educated on how to calculate or ident ify mild to moderate intensity to better recognize exercises that are right for them. Estimation can include percentage of heart rate, metabolic equivalent levels, and the Borg Rate of Perceived Exertion. [83] Further information on exercise intensity can be found in the VA/DoD Obesity CPG7 and through the CDC website8. The benefits of exercise during pregnancy outweigh harms for most women, as exercise can reduce excess maternal weight gain and the incidence of fetal macrosomia in newborns, as well as decrease the rate of neonatal respiratory distress, GDM, depression, and cesarean deliveries. [77-82,84,85 ] T here is no evidence to suggest that exercise causes preterm births, underweight newborns, stillbirths, or increased incidence of shoulder dystocia or induction of labor. [ 77-82,84,85] Pregnant women may note an increase in ut erine cramping with moderate exercise or activity; this is rarely problematic, as long as the cramping ceases with termination of activity. Many women are concerned about risks associated with exercise during pregnancy and are unclear about what types of exercise are safe for them and their babies. Therefore, women need to be educated that moderate intensity exercise can be safely continued du ring pregnancy as long as symptoms of preterm labor do not arise. Many types of exercise were included in the studies identified through the systematic review. Exercise included aerobic, strength training, or a combination of both. It was supervised, in groups, or in independently led programs. Pre -pregnancy fitness level s of participants ranged from sedentary to athletic. The type of exercise a woman chooses may vary but is best and most sustainable if worked into a woman's lifestyle. Obstetric contraindications to aerobic exercise include incompetent cervix or cerclage, multiple gestation, at risk of preterm labor, persistent second or third trimester bleeding, placenta previa after 26 weeks gestation, preterm labor during the current pregnancy, and ruptured membranes. [85 ] M aternal contraindications to aerobic exercise include hemodynamically significant heart disease and restrictive lung disease. Medical conditions that may warrant referral for a supervised exercise program include moderate or severe anemia, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, poorly controlled chronic hypertension, 7 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of Obesity and Overweight. Available at: https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/cd/obesity/ 8 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website on physica l activity is available at: https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/index.html .

[85] Some types of exercise have other benefits. For example, there is moderate quality evidence to support the use of yoga in reducing depression scores during pregnancy in women with or without a diagnosis of prenatal depression. Integrative yoga that may or may not incorporate physical exercise, includes some type of deep breathing or controlled breathing (i.e., pranayama), and includes meditation is more effective than exercise -based yoga alone. [84 ] There is moderate to low quality evidence that some activities and positions should be avoided, such as high- altitude activities (>10,000 feet), prolonged supine positions, Valsalva maneuver, scuba diving, contact sports, or activities that increase the risk for abdominal injuries such as soccer, baseball, basketball, and horseback riding. [85,86] As noted in the 2009 Pregnancy CPG, there is no evidence that s exual intercourse increases the probability of preterm labor in women with uncomplicated pregnancy. [87] Some women may see sexual intercourse as a strenuous aerobic activity. They may experience some uterine contractions following orgasm; however, this is a normal response and women only need to seek medical attention if uterine contractions persist at four or more per hour for at least three hours or if heavy vaginal bleeding is noted. Based on the assessment of the quality of the evidence identified in the 2017 systematic evidence review conducted for this CPG update [ 77-82,84,85 ] as well as the quality of the evidence cited in the 2009 Pregna ncy CPG,[ 87] the Work Group determined confidence in the quality of the evidence was high in support of participation of pregnant women in regular mild to moderate exercise sessions. Other support for this recommendation stemmed from the benefits of regular aerobic exercise outweighing the harms. Recommendation 3. We suggest that women with uncomplicated pregnancies continue a standard work schedule throughout their pregnancy. ( Weak for | Not reviewed, Amended) Discussion If a preg nant woman's work is strenuous or if she spends long periods of time on her feet, she should limit her work week to 40 hours and workday to eight hours during the last trimester (beginning at 28 weeks) or earlier, if she frequently experiences symptoms of preterm labor while at work. Strenuous work is defined as work involving industrial machines or conveyor belts, significant physical exertion or load carrying, or prolonged adverse conditions such as cold temperatures, wet atmosphere, or the manipulation o f chemical substances. [88 ] Physically demanding work and prolonged standing (more than three hours at a time with little movement) increases risk for preterm birth and hypertension or preeclampsia. [88-91] Pregnant women should attempt to limit time on their feet to three hours at a time. Active Duty Service Members should continue to follow their service -specific profiling regulations. Before a specific recommendation can be made regarding particular work limitatio ns, further high- quality studies VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 39 of 147 are needed to examine the association between strenuous or prolonged work activities and adverse pregnancy outcomes. No changes to the current service branch guidelines are suggested as an updated systematic review was not conducted and no new evidence was reviewed for this recommendation. As this is a Not reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review evidence related to this recommendation. Based on the assessment of the quality of the evidence put forth in the 2009 Pregnancy CPG, including peer -reviewed publications [88-91 ] and a publication from another organization, [92] the Work Group determined confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate for offering a group model of prenatal care as an alternative to individual provider appointments. One publicatio n from another organization that was included in the evidence base for the 2009 CPG [ 92] has been updated. [93] The Work Group determined that benefits of this recommendation slightly outweigh the harms for women with uncomplicated pregnancies. A weak recommendation was made due to the considerations that need to be made for women with occupations that require strenuous activity or prolonged periods of standing , for whom the balance of benefits and harms may be different. b. Nutrition Recommendation 4. We recommend folic acid (at least 400 micrograms daily) to be taken starting one month before conception and continued throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding. (St rong for | Not reviewed, Amended) Discussion The recommendation for a pregnant woman to supplement her diet with folic acid beginning one month before conception and continuing throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding is based on support cited in the 2009 Pregnancy CPG [ 94] as well as relevant USPSTF recommendations. [95,96] Neural tube defects (NTD s), one of the most common major congenital anomalies in the U.S., occur at a very early gestational age. Studies have found that preconception folic acid supplements , either alone or combined with other vitamins or minerals (e.g., in a multivitamin), reduces risk of NTDs and should be continued through the first trimester. [ 97-99] Folic acid supplementation has not been found to be associated with serious harms. [95,96] Women prescribed folate antagonists (e.g., antiepileptic, antimalarial, methotrexate) may require doses of folic acid higher than the CDC -reco mmended minimal daily dose of 400 micrograms. For women taking antiepileptic drugs, clinicians should defer to the manufacturer's recommended dosing for folic acid. Women who have had an NTD -affected pregnancy and who are planning on becoming pregnant should take higher levels of folate daily (i.e., 4 milligrams daily) . These women should also consume 0.4 mg (400 micrograms) of folic acid every day when not planning to become pregnant. [ 100] Folic acid supplements are widely available without prescription and generally over the counter. They are also safe and relatively inexpensive. Providers should educate their patients about their options regarding supplementation. In addition to folic acid supplements, women should also be educated on the benefits of eating a folate -rich diet. As this is a Not reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group did not review evidence related to this recommendation. Based on the assessment of the quality of the evidence put forth in the 2009 Pregnancy CPG, [57,58,94,97,98,101-103 ] the Work Group determined confidence in the quality of the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 40 of 147 evidence was high in support of supplementing the diet of a pregnant woman with folate. One systematic review that was included in the evidence base for the 2009 CPG [98] has been updated. [99] Other support for this recommendation stemmed from the benefits of supplementation outweighing the harms. The benefits of folic acid supplementation, including reducing risk of NTDs which carry significant harm, are well documented, whic h led to a \" Strong for\" recommendation. c. Screening Recommendation 5. We recommend screening for use of tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs, and unauthorized use of prescription medication because their use is common and can result in adverse outcomes. For women who screen positive, we recommend additional evaluation and treatment (see VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Substance Use Disorders 9 and the Management of Tobacco Use10). (Strong for | Reviewed, Amended) Discussion Background on Substance Use During Pregnancy Substance use during pregnancy can influence fetal and maternal outcomes. Tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and illicit drugs are the most commonly used substances during pregnancy .[104 ] The 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) found that among pregnant women aged 15 -44 in 2012- 2013, 9.4% reported current alcohol use, 2. 3% reported binge drinking, and 0.4% reported heavy drinking. More than 15% (15.4%) of pregnant women smoked cigarettes and 5.4% of pregnant women used illicit drugs. [105] A report developed based on combined data from a series of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) data sets stated that pregnant women (ages 15 -44) reported less frequent non- medical use of opioids in the previous month than non-pregnant women (0.9% versus 2.6%). [ 106] Substance use among Veterans may be higher than in the general population. Among women Veterans of child -bearing age, it was estimated that 27 -43% have had heavy episodic drinking (defined as four or more standard drinks on at least one occasion), 24 -26% have had daily cigarette use, 12 -29% have reported illicit drug use in the past year, and 6 -14% have reported misuse of prescription drugs. [ 107] Consequences of Prenatal Exposure to Substances Prenatal exposure to substances may increase the risk of congenital anomalies and long -term adverse effects. However, other risky behaviors (e.g., use of multiple substances, lack of prenatal care, and other stressors in the antepartum) confound attempts to assign causality. [108 ] Best available evidence indicates that prenatal smoking may impact pregnancy outcome s by limiting fetal growth as manifest by low birth weight, reduced birth length, or reduced head circumference. A modest increase in the rate of fetal anomalies has also been described. [1 08] Maternal smoking is associated with cardiovascular/heart defects, musculoskeletal defects, limb 9 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Substance Use Disorders.

[109] Alcohol is a known teratogen. The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure are wide -ranging and reflect extent of exposure and susceptibility. Prenatal alcohol exposure causes several abnormalities with the heart, kidney, liver, gastrointestinal tract, endocrine system, and the brain. [110 ] The term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder ( FASD ) describes the broad range of adverse sequellae of fetal alcohol exposure, with fetal alcohol syndrome ( FAS) and its characteristic triad of problems with facial features, growth, and central nervous system as its most severe expression. The risks of prenatal cannabis exposure are unknown. To date, cannabis has not been definitively associated with human teratogenicity nor specific enduring effects in childhoo d or adolescence. [108 ] Opioids in general have not been considered teratogenic, although a higher incidence of congenital anomalies in infants born to mothers exposed to codeine, methadone, or heroin has been reported. [108 ] In utero exposure to opioids is associated with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), defined as a constellation of symptoms in newborns including central nervous system irritability, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and temperature instability. [ 111] The incidence of NAS has increased almost 300% from 1999 to 2013, reflecting increases in use of opioid prescription medications and heroin among women of reproductive age. [ 112,113] Challenges in Identification The DoD screens Active Duty Service Member s for drug use. The VA conducts universal screening for alcohol and tobacco use but not for other substances. The standard threshold for the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption (AUDIT -C) screening tool is not adjusted for gender .[107 ] Moreover, there is no safe drinking limit during pregnancy. [114] The reference standard for the detection of prenatal alcohol exposure is maternal self- reporting. [115] Women may be less likely than men to disclose alcohol use to a primary care provider, resulting in women being less likely to receive effective intervention.[ 116] There is no reliable laboratory test to screen for alcohol use in pregnancy.[ 115, 117] Because there are potential legal and other consequences when positive biological tests are found, informed consent must be obtained prior to their utilization, except in the case of a medical emergency when the pregnant woman is unconscious and unable to consent. Summary Antepartum use of alcohol, cigarettes, illicit drugs, or unauthorized use of prescription medication in this period is not uncommon, and may be associated with adv erse effects. Hence, we recommend screening for tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs, and non -prescribed use of medication, followed by additional evaluation and treatment based on screening results. See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 42 of 147 of Substance Use Disorders (VA/DoD SUD CPG)11 and the Management of Tobacco Use (VA/DoD Tobacco Use CPG)12. As this is a Reviewed, Amended recommendation , the Work Group systematically reviewed the evidence identified in the evidence review conducted for this CPG update [118] and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2009 CPG .[119-128] The Work Group determined confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate in support of screening pregnant women for use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs or unauthorized use of prescription drugs. One systematic review that was included in the evidence base for the 2009 CPG [120] has been updated. [129] The Work Group determined that benefits of this recommendation outweigh the harms for pregnant women and their newborns. Recommendation 6. We recommend screening for depression using a standardized tool such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale or the 9 -item Patient Health Questionnaire periodically during pregnancy and postpartum. (S trong for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion Mod erate quality evidence suggests that screening pregnant and postpartum women for depression using a validated screening tool is more effective than usual clinical assessment in detecting depression and in reducing depressive symptoms, particularly when done with access to interventions such as treatment protocols, care management, and trained clinicians. [130 ] Providers should screen patients periodically, such as at first presentation, week 28, and at the postpartum visit. Potential harms of screening include time spent on screening and discomfort with screening questions. Benefits of screening for depression outweigh harms, given the high prevalence of perinatal depression, adverse maternal and offspring effects of untreated perinatal depressive symptoms, and low rates of detection and treatment entry in the absence of screening. VA/DoD patient focus group findings suggest that pregnant women want to discuss mental health concerns with their clinicians and do not object to depression screening (see Patient Focus Group Methods and Findings ). This is congruent with research findings that perinatal depression screening is acceptable to most women. [131] Screen ing tools and mental health treatment resources are available in the VA and DoD. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the 9 -item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9) are among the screening tools which have been validated for perinatal use. The PHQ -9 is readily available in all VA and DoD clinical settings; the EPDS is more commonly used in perinatal care settings. In a randomized controlled trial ( RCT) comparing these two screening tools, moderate quality evidence suggests 83% concordance be tween the two scales when scores are dichotomized between \"normal\" and \"increased risk of depression.\" [132] Concordance is greatest at the highest score levels, and concordance for suicidal thoughts is very high. More research is needed to determine the optimal screening tool. Evidence to date suggests that screening produces better outcomes than no screening, regardless of which screening tool is 11 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Substance Use Disorders.

Available at: https://www.healthquality.va.gov/CPGArchives.asp VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 43 of 147 used. If used alone, the PHQ -2 (first two items of the PHQ -9) has less specificity; following up with the full PHQ -9 improves specificity with no loss of sensitivity. Using depression screens may not detect other perinatal psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, or PTSD. It is important to have other methods in place to detect these disorders. Screening is not necessary for pre gnant women who have already been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder and are engaged in mental health treatment. More information can be found in the VA/DoD PTSD CPG 13 and the VA/DoD MDD CPG14. Additionally, Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project ( MCPAP) for Moms offers information and tools providers can use in the prevention, identification, and treatment of depression and other mental health conditions. 15 A s this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update. [132] The Work Group determined confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate in support of screening for depression. Other support for t his recommendation stemmed from the benefits of this recommendation outweighing the harms, as the perinatal period is a higher risk time for developing depression, and untreated perinatal depression poses risks to offspring as well as risks to the mother. d. Education Recommendation 7. We recommend breastfeeding education, assessment, and support to all pregnant women and their families at the first visit and throughout the pregnancy and postpartum period using open- ended questions such as \"What do you know about breastfeeding?\" (St rong for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour of life and exclusive breastfeeding for at least six months. [133 ] The health benefits of breastfeeding for both the mother and the newborn have been well -documented. Breastfeeding has been shown to lower the risk of type 2 DM , certain types of breast cancer, and ovarian cancer in mothers and asthma, childhood leukemia, and type 2 DM in children .[134, 135] However, the various ways in which clinicians instruct their patients about breastfeeding differs immensely across clinical settings. What seems to be clear is that the education should start prenatally (ideally at the first visit), be continued throug hout the pregnancy, and include the pregnant woman's family or chosen support people. Breastfeeding education can be provided in individual appointments or through a group model of prenatal care (see Recommendation 1). Breastfeeding education should be tailored to the needs and resources of the community. A provider should approach the topic with sensitivity and foster a supportive environment. A breastfeeding education program which used open- ended questions focusing on the woman's beliefs about breastfeeding was 13 See the VA/DoD Clinica l Practice Guideline for the Management of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder. Available at: https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/MH/ptsd/ 14 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Major Depressive Disorder. Available at: https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/MH/mdd/ 15 See the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Acces s Project (MCPAP) for Moms website. Available at: https://www.mcpapformoms.org/ VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 44 of 147 effective in increasing breastfeeding. [136] Breastfeeding assessment in the prenatal period should include breast examination to screen for potential breastfeeding challenges, such as those related to inverted or \"flat\" nipples, history of breast augmentation or reduction , suspected breast hypoplasia or insufficient glandular tissue, past breastfeeding experience/perc eptions , use of medications known to interfere with milk production, and basic education pertaining to the benefits of breastfeeding and local resources and support programs available. As indicated, pregnant women should be referred to a certified lactatio n consultant (as available) for additional lactation support and education. According to cohort studies by Fairlie et al. (2009) and Wouk et al. (2016), women who experience anxiety and depression during pregnancy are just as likely to initiate breastfeed ing as women who do not, while those who experience anxiety or depression in the postpartum period are far less likely to continue exclusive breastfeeding. [137, 138 ] By providing additional support, providers may be able to identify and address potential breastfeeding challenges for women over the course of their pregnancy and thus increase the number of women who are exclusively breastfeeding. As this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update.[ 137, 138 ] The Work Group determined confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate in support of breastfeeding education, assessment, and support. Other support for this recommendation stemmed from the benefits of breastfeeding support outweighing the harms. B. One -time Interventions a. Screening and Diagnostic Testing Recommendation 8. We suggest making prenatal diagnostic testing for aneuploidy available to all pregnant women. ( Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion There are no RCTs or SRs evaluating the overall benefits of offering prenatal diagnostic testing to all pregnant women. The Work Group 's confidence in the quality of the evidence is low, except regarding risk of pregnancy loss with procedures for which the confidence in the quality of the evidence is high. The Pregnancy CPG Work Group acknowledges that this recommendation is based, in part, on consensus and expert opinion from ACOG and the Society for Maternal- Fetal Medicine (SMFM); [139, 140] therefore it is the accepted standard of care, and the Work Group determined this recommendation was appropriate for inclusion in the CPG. The benefits of invasive prenatal diagnostic testing include improving the ability to plan and to make more informed pregnancy and birth management decisions. Some women may choose to electively terminate their pregnancies based on these results. For women who choose to continue their pregnancies, early diagnostic testing affords the opportunity to learn about the diagnosis and prepare for the birth and the neonatal period. It also facilitates earlier consultation with other pediatric subspecialists (e.g., developmental p ediatricians ). Offering prenatal diagnostic testing, regardless of maternal age or risk factors, respects the values and preferences of women who make this choice. The potential harms include the small, but known, ris k of pregnancy loss, which is about 1/455 (0.22%) for chorionic villus sampling VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 45 of 147 (CVS) and about 1/900 (0.1%) for amniocentesis. [141] Pregnant women considering invasive prenatal diagnostic testing should be counseled about the risks, benefits, limitations, and alternatives to invasive testing by a provider qualified to conduct this counseling. [142] There may be increased costs associated with prenatal diagnostic testing. Because some facilities do not offer CVS and/or amniocentesis, pregnant women may be referred to outside facilities to obtain testing. This will likely increase out -of-pocket and/or travel costs. Based on the a ssessment of the quality of the evidence identified in the 2017 evidence review as well as on the assessment of the quality of the evidence put forth in the 2009 Pregnancy CPG, which included peer -reviewed publications [143- 148] and a publication from another organization ,[139 ] the Work Group determined overall confidence in the quality of the evidence was low in support of making prenatal diagnostic testing available. ACO G and SMFM published an updated version [ 140] of the publication included as evidence in the 2009 CPG. [139] The recommendation is, in part, based on consensus and expert opinion from ACOG and SMFM, rather than prospective studies. The 2017 evidence review did not identify any new studies that showed a direct benefit of invasive testing; however, the availability of prenatal diagnos tic testing for all patients, regardless of age, supports patient autonomy and may be beneficial to patients in making pregnancy and birth management decisions. Future research should examine the characteristics of pregnant women most likely to choose inv asive diagnostic testing, especially those who do not have a known increased risk for fetal genetic disorders. The optimal method to educate pregnant women about the growing list of prenatal testing options should be continuously re -evaluated, as the information and testing options continue to increase in complexity. Finally, the optimal test (e.g., karyotype, targeted micro -array, genome -wide array) in the low -risk patient is not known. Recommendation 9. We recommend offering prenatal screening for aneuploidy and the most common clinically significant genetic disorders to all pregnant women. When aneuploidy screening is desired, cell - free fetal DNA screening should be considered; however, screening test selection should be individualized and take into account the patient's age, baseline aneuploidy risk, and test performance for a given condition. (S trong for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion Some women strongly desire prenatal screening for aneuploidy and other genetic disorders to guide management of their pregnancy. Others do not desire this screening. The benefits of testing are that, if the testing is positive, women have time to become ed ucated about having a child with a genetic disorder. They also have an opportunity to consult with providers who may be involved in the care of their child, such as de velopmental p ediatricians. Benefits may be greatest for women who are at high risk of aneuploidy (e.g., greater maternal age). Risks of aneuploidy screening include false positive and negative results, potential pregnancy loss if patients subsequently pursue invasive diagnostic testing, and maternal anxiety from testing. The benefits and harms of aneuploidy screening should be discussed with all patients with the ultimate decision taking into account patient's individual preferences and personal values. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 46 of 147 There are multiple aneuploidy screening tests available. Some screening tests assess analyte s in the maternal serum independently ( e.g., quad s creen , serum integrated in conjunction with assessment of nuchal translucency ( e.g., integrated screen, first trimester screen, sequential s creen). Some assess placental DNA in the maternal circulation ( e.g., cell -free fetal deoxyribonucleic acid [ cffDNA ] screen ). Each test's performance has different sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values, which are affected by the a priori risk of a given aneuploidy based on maternal age. Resource use also varies between tests. cffDNA screening has the highest sensitivity and specificity of the available screening t ests for Down syndrome in high- risk women.[ 149- 154] The test also screens for trisomy 18 and trisomy 13, but has lower detection rates for these conditions. Though cf fDNA has a lower false positive rate than traditional serum screening, the positive predictive value (chance that a positive test is a true positive) depends on the patient's a priori risk of having the condition. The positive predictive value should be calculated and provided as part of pre - and post -test counseling. Another potential risk of cffDNA is receiving a non - diagnostic test result. This may be due to low fetal fraction or the presence of other chromosomal conditions. Women with non- diagnostic test results will require further evaluation and counseling, which can potentially increase costs and use of services, and maternal anxiety. cffDNA screening carries a risk of identifying undiagnosed genetic disorders or carcinomas in the mother and identifying non- paternity or consanguinity in tests using single nucleotide polymorphism technology. This test can also identify fetal gender, which some pregnant women may not wish to know prior to birth. Women who have undergone in-vitro fertilization with donor eggs may be candidates for this test; providers should understand test recommendations and limitations prior to ordering. Adequate pre -test counseling is required for all aneuploidy screening tests. The ability to provide post - test counseling for pregnant women who screen negative, as well as the availability of timely post -test counseling and diagnostic prenatal testing for pregnant women who screen positive, is necessary. The field of prenatal screening is rapidly evolving, and gaps in both patient and provider understanding are anticipated. There will also be emerging technologies that outpace CPG updates. The Work Group acknowledges that serum screening has the ability to identify a broader scope of conditions than cffDNA screening, including for example Smith -Lemli -Opitz symdrome and unexplained elevated alpha - fetoprotein, for which younger women may be at greater risk than aneuploidy. This limitation should be addressed as part of pre -test counseling and included as part of a woman's decision on which s creening test they choose. Finally, the predictive value of cffDNA testing is dependent upon maternal age, with greater predictive values for aneuploidy as maternal age increases, due to the greater prevalence of aneuploidy with advancing age. Its utility in younger patients, who have a lower prevalence of aneuploidy, may not be cost -effective and patient's individual desires and values should be factored into the decision on which screening test to complete. The optimal provider type to counsel women about prenatal screening options is unknown; however, there are not enough genetic counselors available to conduct pre -test counseling for all pregnant women. Due to the rapid expansion and availability of genetic testing, there is a significant need for increased provider education to provide adequate patient counseling. The Work Group acknowledges that the field of prenatal genetic screening is rapidly evolving ; patient and provider understanding, test availability, and cost considerations may vary widely and are likely to change. The Work Group acknowledges that there VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 47 of 147 are additional recommendations from professional societies to offer carrier screening to all pregnant women for specific genetic conditions (e.g., cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, hemoglobinopathies). Such tests if performed, do not need to be repeated in each pregnancy. Counseling should include residual risk estimates of having an affected child. The rate of uptake of prenatal screening based on place of care and provider type (e.g., academic military treatment facilities versus community -based military treatment facilities versus purchased care) should be examined to improve understanding of current prenatal screening strategies. This may, in turn, help improve screening services. Limitations of non -invasive prenatal screening should also be examined. Evaluation of provider proficiency in counseling and understanding of rapidly evolving technologies as related to prenatal screening is critical. Determining the effectiveness of individual versus group- based counseling versus other modalities such as web- based counseling will also guide approaches to counseling moving forward. As this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to thi s recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update. [149-154 ] The Work Group determined confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate in support of using cffDNA screening if aneuploidy screening is desired. As women have varying preferences regarding aneuploidy screening, the Work Group recommends offering the screening and, if desired, selecting the test with the best performance based on maternal age, risk factors, and test perform ance for a specific condition. Recommendation 10. We suggest the two -step process (one -hour oral glucose challenge test followed by three -hour oral glucose tolerance test) to screen for gestational diabetes mellitus at 24 -28 weeks gestation for all pregnant w omen. (W eak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion Background GDM is defined as marked impairment of glucose metabolism initially identified during pregnancy. Pregnant women with GDM are at increased risk for developing fetal macrosomia and requiring ope rative delivery. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled GDM may also lead to neonatal morbidity, such as hypoglycemia, polycythemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Treatment aimed at normalizing glucose metabolism has been shown to reduce these risks. Therefore, any pregnant woman with GDM should have additional surveillance and management beyond the scope o f this guideline. Testing For most women, screening for GDM should be undertaken at 24 -28 weeks gestation. It is typically diagnosed using a two -step process.[ 155- 157] The first step is the administration of a one -hour 50 -gram non- fasting oral glucose challenge test (GCT) (which includes a blood draw). The typically accepted upper limit for this one -hour screen ranges between 130 and 140 mg/dL. Women who are outside this acceptable range will require the second step. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 48 of 147 The second step (for women who screen positive in the first step) is the diagnostic fasting three- hour 100-gram glucose tolerance test (GTT). There are two accep table sets of threshold values for this three - hour screen that can be used to diagnose GDM. The older criteria defined by the National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG) (1979) considers the test positive and the pregnant woman to have GDM if at least two of the f our values are equal to or exceed 105 mg/dL, 190 mg/dL, 165 mg/dL, and 145 mg/dL for the fasting, one -hour, two -hour, and three -hour specimens, respectively.[ 158 ] The Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus has proposed alternate values, which are believed to more closely approximate the original Carpenter and Coustan (1982) criteria of 95 mg/dL, 180 mg/dL, 155 mg/dL, and 140 mg/dL for the fasting, one -hour, two -hour, and three -hour specimens, respectively. [ 159,160] There is currently insufficient evidence -based comparison data to recommend one set of criteria over the other. There is a growing body of evidence, albeit insufficient at this time, to suggest a simplified testing schema in the future. Rationale Moderate quality evidence suggests that the benefits of screening slightly outweigh the harms/burden of screenin g, but universal consensus has not been reached on that point. Benefits of screening include early, appropriate diagnosis and treatment for those pregnant women requiring insulin and the resultant avoidance of DM- related complications. Specifically, early, appropriate treatment may lead to a reduction in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, a decrease in cesarean deliveries, and a decrease in macrosomia.[ 161 ] Harms associated with testing include treatment with insulin for those who would not necessarily develop these complications, as well as the time and expense of both counseling an d treatment. There is modest variation in patient preference regarding screening, as some patients may wish to avoid blood draws or may not want to wait for a three -hour GTT. However, the majority of patients value GDM screening and will return for testin g if educated by their providers about the benefits of testing. Those who are informed of an abnormal value and do not return for the three -hour test may lack the proper education about testing, may be unable to invest the time for a three -hour GTT, or may want to avoid multiple blood draws. In a pilot study by Scifres et al. (2015), which also examined patient and provider preferences on GDM, 94% of the providers surveyed believed screening women for GDM was important and 92% of those providers recommended the current two -step strategy. [162 ] In co ntrast, patients preferred the two -hour, 75 -gram oral GT T, in the absence of a provider recommendation to the contrary. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1 c) lacks both sensitivity and specificity to serve as an adequate screening tool. [163] The Work Group further acknowledges that the need for resources varies directly with the number of women tested. With an increase in diagnoses of GDM, referral to RDNs will be appropriate. Depending on the degree of blood sugar control in a particular woman, additional prenatal visits and maternal and fetal surveillance and other services may also be indicated. Women with Risk Factors for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Women with risk factors for GDM (e.g., history of GDM in prior pregnancy, previous delivery of a macrosomic infant [>4,000 g], pre -pregnancy BMI >30 kg/m2, first degree relative with DM , and certain high-risk ethnic groups [e.g., Native Americans, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders]) [ 164] may benefit from earlier VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 49 of 147 screening and treatment, but should be re -screened at 24 -28 weeks if initial testing is normal. Women with a one -hour GC T value > 200 mg/dL may be treated presumptively for GDM without a confirmatory test. Women with, or at high risk of, dumping syndrome following gastric bypass surgery may benefit from screening for GDM with a fasting and two -hour postprandial glucose values rather than an oral glucose load. Summary and Future Research As this is a Re viewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update.[ 161, 162] The Work Group determined confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate in support of the two -step process to screen pregnant women for GDM. Other support for this recommendation stemmed from benefits of screening slightly outweighing harms and patient values and preferences. Future research is needed to definitively demonstrate whether a single two -hour oral GTT would be sufficient to diagnose GDM and adequate to replace the two -step process. b. Imaging Recommendation 11. We recommend first- trimester ultrasound to establish or confirm the gestational age and estimated birth date, identify multiple pregnancies, and confirm the presence of cardiac activity. For pregnant women who present after the first trimester, we suggest performing a dating and anatomical ultrasound at the earliest opportunity, preferably prior to 22 weeks. (S trong for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion Reliable gestational age is crucial for assessment of fetal size and growth since this may influence management decisions that could, in turn, influence outcomes at peri -viable gestational ages. Self- report of last menstrual period (LMP) is often used to estimate gestational age but may be unreliable. [165] Ultrasonography before 20 weeks gestation is generally viewed as a more accurate method of estimating gestational age than menstrual dating. Ultrasound assessment is limited by the implicit assumption that below a certain gestational age all fetal size variability is due to gestational age, which can lead to systematic under -estimation of gestational age among pregnancies exhibiting early growth restriction measured in later scans. However, this is less of a concern for very early ultrasound scans given that variation in fetal size is minimal during the first trimester of pregnancy. A large prospective study by Hoffman et al. (2008) followed 1,867 participants who were required to report the month and day of LMP and undergo first -trimester transvaginal ultrasounds. [165] This study suggests that early reporting of LMP results in similar gestational age dating as that obtained from early ultrasound. However, when discrepant, the LMP estimate of gestational age tended to be greater tha n ultrasound -based gestational age and resulted in a higher proportion of births being classified as post - term. Inaccurate determination of gestational age may lead to suboptimal planning of care throughout the pregnancy. Another large prospective study ( 3,760 participants) by Verburg et al. (2008) compared gestational age at birth using estimates from LMP versus ultrasound imaging. [166] The study provided charts for ultrasound VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 50 of 147 dating of pregnancy based on crown- rump length and biparietal diameter and concluded that first trimester ultrasounds, preferably between 10 and 12 weeks, are better for the prediction of gestational age. As this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update.[ 165, 166] The Work Group determined confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate in support of first -trimester ultrasound to establish or confirm the gestational age and estimated birth date. Other support for this recommendation stemmed from benefits of this recommendation outweighing the harms. Benefits include improved timing of planned births and avoidance of post -term birth compl ications. There is some variation in patient and provider preferences regarding first -trimester ultrasound. Access issues may make it difficult for some patients to get an ultrasound, particularly in rural or resource -poor settings. Future research priorit ies include how the quality and accuracy of the dating ultrasound are affected by provider level or characteristics (e.g., practitioner and specialty type, training, qualifications). c. Preparing for Delivery Recommendation 12. We recommend offering scheduled delivery to women who reach 41 weeks and 0/7 days undelivered. Antepartum fetal testing should begin at 41 weeks and 0/7 days if not scheduled for delivery. ( Strong for | Reviewed, Amended) Discussion Gestational age beyond 40 weeks is associated with increasing risk of perinatal death and perinatal complication. A Cochrane review by Gulmezoglu et al. (2012) identified that a policy of labor induction at 42 weeks gestational age compared to expectant management is associated with fewer perinatal deaths and fewer cesarean births .[167 ] Perinatal complications after 41 weeks gestational age have also been documented to include asphyxia, fetal distress, sepsis, and meconium aspiration. [167, 168] In addition, the re has been a documented increased risk of intrauterine death after 37 and 0/7 weeks gestation in pregnancies complicated by high maternal age (35 years) and in women with high BMI. [169] Consistent with these findings, the Work Group recommends that women who reach 41 and 0/7 weeks be offered planned delivery. There is moderate confidence in the quality of the current evidence that women of all ages reduc e the negative neonatal outcomes by delivering before 41 and 0/7. [170 ] Studies have also shown an equal or lower rate of cesarean delivery in women for whom pregnancy is induced at 41 we eks compared to women for whom expectant management is used. [171, 172] Counseling women in order to make an informed decision about scheduled inductions or antepartum fetal monitoring without induction will help prioritize pregnant women's values . Some women may value immediate delivery, while others may prefer to wait. The costs associated with induction include increased length of hospital stay and increased nursing contact time versus costs incurred by outpatient monitoring followed by induction if spontaneous labor does not occur. However, medical costs and resource allocation associated with perinatal complications are also high, making this approach valuable in reducing negative outcomes and costs. Some patient variability in values will be n oted in this approach as some VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 51 of 147 women highly value deliveries without intervention and have limited time for antenatal monitoring. These women may find this approach less acceptable than those that highly value the reduction of risk. As noted above, women wi th complicated pregnancies comprise a higher risk subgroup that may have more negative outcomes at an earlier gestational age and should be treated separately. As this is a Reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the eviden ce identified in the evidence review conducted for this CPG update [170 ] and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2009 CPG .[171-174] The Work Group determined confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate in support of a strong recommendation to offer scheduled delivery for women who reach 41 weeks and 0/7 days undelivered. Other support for this recommendation stemmed from the benefits of this recommendation, which include improved delivery outcomes, outweighing the ha rms. d. Postpartum Care Recommendation 13. For pregnant women who have a past or current history of gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or preeclam psia, we recommend documenting the reproductive history and making women aware of the increased lifetime risks of cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes. (S trong for | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion Pregnancy is often referred to as a \"stress test\" as it relates to the cardiovascular and metabolic systems of the mother. There are dramatic shifts in blood volume, hemodynamics, and lipid/glucose metabolism to accommodate the growing needs of the fetus. However, these adaptive mechanisms may become dysregulated and lead to adverse clinical outcomes in both the mother and fetus. Over the past few decades, it has become increasingly apparent that these adverse conditions that occur during pregnancy can serve as a marker of future maternal cardiovascular, metabolic, and possible rheumatologic risk. Such adverse conditions include hypertensive conditions of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, as well as GDM. Evidence reviewed in development of this recommendation included analyses of three SRs [ 175- 177] and 12 individual cohort or case -control studies [ 178-189 ] that evaluated the potential association between pregnancy complications (preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and GDM) and adverse lifetime health outcomes (CVD, DM , and rheumatoid arthritis). The overall quality of evidence supporting an association between hypertensive conditions of pregnancy, preeclampsia and GDM was determined to be moderate. Although these conditions may become quiescent during the postpartum period, there is a breadth of epidemiologic evidence that long- term increase in cardiovascular and metabolic risk exists that clinically manifest many years later. Recognition of these adverse pregnancy risk factors as markers for future health risk is important, as women in their childbearing years are often otherwise healthy and it may not be obvious to most p roviders to consider screening for hypertension and DM in such women. There are no studies assessing the effect of specific interventions to modify this risk. There may be potential benefit to periodic screening (e.g., yearly screening for DM and hypertens ion) and lifestyle modifications; however, future research is needed. Studies have shown that many providers in primary care and obstetrics under - recognize these adverse pregnancy conditions. [190 ] Initiatives to increase awareness amongst those VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 52 of 147 working in various specialties as well as a broad range of providers including nursing, physicians, and women's health providers are in progress. Primary care providers should obtain a reproductive history yearly in women of childbearing age; a one - time assessment in women who are postm enopausal without prior history of CVD is sufficient. Specifically, inquiry should be focused on a history of gestational hypertension/preeclampsia (previously known as toxemia) and GDM. Benefits of awareness of lifetime risk and regular cardiovascular screening in these women outweigh harms. It is recommended that women with a history of acute pulmonary edema, often associated with other conditions such as preeclampsia or magnesium sulfate toxicity, be encouraged to have a follow -up visit in primary care. Documentation of an episode of acute pulmonary edema should be added to the patient's problem list and be readily accessible. The importance of follow -up and discussion of such acute pulmonary edema conditions with a general follow -up provider should be stressed, as most pregnant women would be receptive to prevention of CVD and DM . As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update. [ 175- 189] The Work Group determined confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate in support of documenting pregnancy history and making pregnant women aware about the lifetime risk of these conditions. Other support for this recommendation stemmed from the benefits of this recommendation, which include the potential to improve care, outweighing the harms. Several areas of future research would be helpful in this area in regards to timing of screening and specific interventions for these women. Additionally, there is increasing evidence for association between other adverse pregnancy conditions, such as premature birth s and recurrent miscarriage, and long -term cardiovascular risk. There is also some suggestion that adverse pregnancy conditions may also increase rheumatologic risk, specifically rheumatoid arthritis; however, definitive evidence to support this is lacking. This, along with specific use of intervention therapies such as anti- hypertensives, should be considered as a focus for future prevention trials. C. Referral Recommendation 14. We suggest that pregnant women with an unexplained elevation of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein be evaluated and counseled by a qualified obstetric provider due to increased risk for adverse perinatal outcomes. ( Weak for | Not reviewed, Amended) Discussion This recommendation was carried forward from the 2009 Pregnancy CPG and is based on publications that indicated an increased risk of adverse outcomes, such as preterm birth, preterm rupture of membranes, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and intrauterine fetal death with unexplained elevated alpha-fetoprotein.[ 139, 191,192 ] Counseling about these findings should be conducted by an obstetric provider VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 53 of 147 who is able to discuss the meaning of an unexplained elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) and arrange for appropriate follow -up. An SR and meta -analysis published s ince the completion of the evidence review conducted for the 2009 Pregnancy CPG concludes that elevated MSAFP is a risk factor for the pregnancy complications of preeclampsia and low birth weight. [193 ] This study did not examine other outcomes of importance to patients and providers, such as spontaneous preterm labor, stillbirth, or preterm premature rupture of the membranes. The benefits of this recommendation sligh tly outweigh the harms and burdens. The benefit is that pregnant women with elevated MSAFP would undergo heightened surveillance and possible earlier detection of preeclampsia or fetal growth restriction. This may also identify a specific subgroup of pregnant women who may receive better protection from the use of prophylactic aspirin for prevention of preeclampsia. One potential harm is that the subgroup of women who will experience complications cannot be predicted. Further, knowledge of the test results and increased surveillance may heighten anxiety, and place the pregnant woman at risk for increased, and potentially unnecessary, interventions. There are limitations to consider with this recommendation. The definition and diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia have changed over time, and the cited review is not based on the current diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia. [193 ] It would be clinically useful to examine the predictive value of analytes for fetal growth restriction, which may necessitate early birth . This study did not review other complications associated with elevated MSAFP, such as stillbirth or premature labor. [193] As this is a Not reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review evidence related to this recommendation. Based on the assessment of the quality of the evidence put forth in the 2009 Pregnancy CPG, including a peer -reviewed publication of a scientific study [ 191 ] and publications from other organizations, [139, 192] the Work Group determined the confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate in support of a qualified obstetric provider evaluating and counseling pregnant women with persistent unexplained elevations of MSAFP. The publications from other organizations that were included in the evidence base for the 2009 CPG [ 139,192] have been updated. [140, 194,195] Other support for this recommendation stemmed from the benefits slightly outweighing the harms. More research is needed to identify the role of serum analytes in a time when non -invasive prenatal screening is replacing serum analyte use for aneuploidy screening. Whether serum analytes have a role in risk prediction with respect to pregnancy complications, rather than being used for aneuploidy screening, needs to be determined. Finally, the specific combination and appropriate gestational age to examine serum analytes in not known. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 54 of 147 Recommendation s 15. We recommend against routine screening for preterm delivery using the fetal fibronectin test in asymptomatic women. ( Strong against | Not reviewed, Amended) 16. We recommend considering the use of fetal fibronectin testing as a part of the evaluation strategy in women between 24 and 34 6/7 weeks gestation with signs and symptoms of preterm labor, particularly in facilities where the result might affect management of delivery . (S trong for | Not reviewed, Amended) Discussion Fetal fibronectin testing has a narrowly defined role in obstetric evaluation, and therefore should only be used when it has the potential to alter care. Several prospective cohort studies have shown no improvement in outcomes for either mother or baby. [196, 197 ] The potential value of fetal fibronectin testing in the setting of evaluation or triage of preterm labor is to more precisely discriminate bet ween the subset of women who have true preterm labor versus false labor. [198] In a woman at low risk for preterm delivery presenting with preterm contractions, a negative test may inform the decision to use or avoid tocolytics and corticosteroids. [197] Alternatively, a positive test may allow providers at some facilities to arrange transfer of women identified as at higher risk of preterm delivery to facilities better suited to manage the complications of a preterm birth. In asymptomatic women, the low positive and negative predictive values limit the test's value in medical decision making. Other methods of screening for preterm delivery addressed in the 2009 VA/DoD Pregnancy CPG included cervical length. One large RCT examined the difference in rates of low birth weight , delivery at less than 37 weeks gestation, and premature rupture of membranes between women who received routine cervical examinations and women who did not. It found no statistically significant difference between groups. [199] Recent research, identified outside of the systematic evidence review, also found that routine cervical length screening for the general population was not effective in predicting preterm birth. [200] As these are Not reviewed, Amended recommendations, the Work Group did not systematically review evidence related to these recommendations. Based on the assessment of the quality of the evidence put forth in the 2009 Pregnancy CPG, including peer -reviewed publications [196-198,201-203] and one publication from another organization, [204] the Work Group determined confidence in the quality of the evidence for both recommendations was moderate . One publication from another organization that was included in the evidence base for the 2009 CPG [204] has been updated and is consistent with the current recommenda tions. [205]. Recent research, identified outside of the systematic evidence review, has found that fetal fibronectin testing in asymptomatic women provided no benefit .[200,206] While testing was not found to be clinically harmful, it was associated with increased resource use. [206] The Work Group developed the strong recommendation against testing in asymptomatic women due to the absence of benefit coupled with the non -negligible cost of widespread testing . In the symptomatic sub - population, acknowledging that there is very limited potential benefit for women treated in a large cross -section of treatment facilities, the Work Group valued the modest benefit in terms of treatment and transfer decision -making over the costs of the test for women treated at those select smaller facilities who might benefit. W hen testing is judiciously applied to those circumstances , the result may VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 55 of 147 likely alter management. The timeframe of 24 to 34 6/7 weeks gestation was chosen because it represents the period between viability and the point at which particular inventions (e.g., steroid treatment, tocolytics) would be considered. The lower limit of the ge stational age testing, which may prompt intervention, should be individualized at each treatment facility, based on the threshold of viability established jointly by the neonatal intensive care unit and obstetric service. D. Special Considerations a. High Risk for Preeclampsia Recommendation 17. For women at risk of preeclampsia, we recommend low dose (e.g., 100 -150 mg daily) aspirin therapy initiated at or before 16 weeks gestation. (S trong for | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion Roberge et al. (2016), through an SR and meta -analysis of RCTs, compared the effect of daily aspirin or placebo during pregnancy. [207] The study, which included 45 RCTs totalin g 20,909 pregnant women taking 6 0-150 mg of aspirin daily, found that low -dose aspirin therapy initiated at or before 16 weeks gestation resulted in a significant reduction in preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. A dose response effect was observed with higher dosages of aspirin being associated with greater risk reduction of the three outcomes. In a comparison between 60 mg and 100 mg aspirin daily, there was no significant impact of 60 mg/day of aspirin on the prevalence of preeclampsia, severe preeclam psia, or fetal growth restriction. Initiating 100 mg/day of aspirin before 16 weeks gestation proved to be the most beneficial. The Block -Abraham et al. (2014) prospective cohort study found that , for some of the women at an increased risk of developing p reeclampsia, the risk may not be significant after a stepwise logistic regression, partially due to confounding issues (e.g., DM , hypertension, prior preeclampsia and obesity). [208] Some populations respond better . According to Gan et al. (2016), taking low dose aspirin decreased risk of preeclampsia in both subgroups studied, East Asians and non -East Asians; however, this study did not provide clinically significant information regarding other subpopulations. [209] The Wo rk Group notes the USPSTF recommends low dose aspirin for prevention of preeclampsia in women with risk factors such as history of preeclampsia, multiple gestation, chronic hypertension, or DM .[ 210] As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update.[ 208, 209 ] The Work Group determined the confidence in the quality of the evidence was high in support of low dose aspirin therapy for prevention of preeclampsia in women at risk. Other support for this recommendation stemmed from the benefits of this recommendation outweighing the harms. The benefits of taking low dose aspirin outweigh the harms of pot ential placental abruption, postpartum hemorrhage, or fetal harms such as intracranial bleeding and congenital anomalies. Aspirin in 81 mg strength is widely available in the U.S. over- the-counter or on the VA and DoD formularies. While the dosage and timi ng of initiation of low -dose aspirin varied across studies, the benefits of taking low dose aspirin outweighed the harms consistently across dosages and timing of initiation . Further research is VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 56 of 147 indicated for populations with the highest risk of developing preeclampsia. Additional studies examining any long- term effects of fetal exposure to low dose aspirin therapy are needed . b. High Risk for Preterm Delivery Recommendation 18. We recommend antenatal progesterone therapy in consultation with an advanced prena tal care provider (e.g., obstetrician or maternal- fetal medicine) for women at high risk for recurrent preterm delivery and who meet the generally accepted inclusion criteria. (S trong for | Not reviewed, Amended) Discussion Studies show that the administration of progesterone intramuscularly or intravaginally beginning early in pregnancy in women at high risk for preterm birth significantly reduces the rate of preterm delivery. [211- 213] Specifically, wom en with a prior spontaneous birth at less than 37 weeks gestation benefit from the administration of progesterone. Progesterone therapy is typically started early in the second trimester and continued until approximately 36 weeks. Both intramuscular 17 alp ha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (250 mg, administered weekly) and vaginal progesterone suppositories (100 -200 mg, administered once daily) have been found to be effective. One RCT (Deeks et al., 2011) found that using a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved formulation of 17 alpha- hydroxyprogesterone caproate intramuscularly (the formulation used in the study was Makena) significantly reduced preterm delivery at 37, 35, and 32 weeks gestation in singleton pregnancies (not studied in women with m ultiple gestations). Preterm delivery rates were lower with treatment than with placebo. The benefit of the treatment in reducing the risk of preterm birth was observed in spontaneous deliveries regardless of maternal race. Furthermore, this study indicate d a significantly lower rate of adverse neonatal outcomes such as necrotizing enterocolitis, need for supplemental oxygen, birth weight of <2500g, and intraventricular hemorrhage among infants of women who received 17 alpha -hydroxyprogesterone caproate than among infants of placebo recipients. [214 ] 17 alpha -hydroxyprogesterone caproate -exposed neonates showed no evidence of detrimental effect in a two to five year follow -up. 17 alpha -hydroxyprogesterone caproate is, at the time of publication, available on VA and DoD formularies. Further research may concentrate on following 17 alpha- hydroxyprogesterone caproate -exposed neonates beyond five years for evidence of detrimental effects. As this is a Not reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review evidence related to this recommendation. Based on the assessment of the quality of the evidence put forth in the 2009 Pregnancy CPG, including peer -reviewed publications [211- 213] and a publication from another organization, [204] the Work Group determined confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate in support of antenatal progesterone therapy for women with a history of preterm delivery who are at risk for subsequent preterm delivery. One publication from another organization that was included in the evidence base for the 2009 CPG [ 204] has been updated. [205] The support for the strength of this recommendation is based on the significant benefits related to reducing morbidity and mortality that this treatment has for the developing fetus which clearly outweigh any potential harm. No evidence of detrimental effects between birth and five years of age has been found when the fetus was exposed to prenatal progesterone. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 57 of 147 c. Over 44 Years of Age Recommendation 19. We suggest offering w omen greater than 44 years of age planned delivery at 38 weeks gestational age to reduce the risk of stillbirth . (We ak for | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion The number of women over the age of 35 having children has increased significantly in the past few decades. [215] Advanced maternal age has been associated with higher rates of late -term stillbirths.[ 216] Compared with women under 35 years of age, women of advanced maternal age appear to reach late -term stillbirth rates at an earlier gestational age. [217] In addition to the adverse psychological consequences associated with stillbirth, women of advanced maternal age are also less likely to become pregnant again. Alternative methods of management of pregnancy in women ages >35 has often been suggested. [ 218] Chaudhary and Contag (2017) found that only mothers over the age of 44 had reduced prenatal mortality risk with immediate delivery at 38 weeks gestation. [219] This moderate quality evidence formed the basis for this recommendation. This retrospective cohort study of over 16 million pregnancies found that the relative risk of stillbirth was decreased in women over the age of 44 (relative risk: 0.35, 95% confidence interval: 0.14 -0.90) with planned delivery at 38 weeks compared to expectant management. Authors note that there was a low relative risk of death or complication from immediate delivery at 38 for all mothers. However, the reduction in stillbirth rates only occur in mothers over 44 years . Given the great benefit of avoiding stillbirth, the W ork Group decided that a recommendation for immediate delivery at 38 weeks was warranted for women over 44 years . A second study only examined women between 35 and 44 years of age. Walker et al. (2016) completed an RCT of primigravid mothers 35 to 44 years of age. [220 ] The primary aim of the study was to determine if planned birth or induction of labor at 39 weeks reduced the risk of neonatal death. This study provided high quality evidence that induction at 39 weeks did not reduce cesarean deliveries rates in primigravid women ages 35 -44, and moderate quality evidence that it did not reduce maternal complications or neonatal outcomes. [220] Given that outcomes are similar in this group, patient preference and values should be considered when developing delivery plans for primigravid women aged 35 -44 with uncomplicated pregnancies. Patient involvement in decisions about the method of delivery is considered best practice for all pregnancies and was a theme that emerged during the patient focus group (see Patient Focus Group Methods and Findings ). Increased financial costs for monitoring and medical interventions associated with planned induction are outweighed by reducing the highly negative impact of stillbirth. There may be an increase in late -term respiratory complications, although this was not demonstrated in an identified study. [220 ] Induction needs to be weighed against patient preferences, healthcare costs, and maternal outcomes. Counseling women of advanced maternal age on their risk of stillbirth is important as the trend of advancing age for first and subsequent pregnancies continues. [ 221] VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 58 of 147 As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendati on, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update.[ 219, 220] The Work Group determined the confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate in support of planned delivery in women over the age of 44. There is moderate evidence available to support delivering women greater than 44 years of age at 38 weeks. One retrospective study of moderate qual ity (Chaudhary and Contag, 2017) found a clear benefit for women over 44 to be delivered at 38 weeks. [ 219] Our selection criteria also identified one RCT , rated as \"Good\" per USPSTF criteria, that evaluated women between ages 35-44 planned induction. [220] Findings did not support early induction between the ages of 35 -44. The Work Group acknowledges that additional evidence that both supports and contradicts planned induction at advanced maternal ages exists, but was not included in this evidence review . These mixed results did not meet the inclusion criteria for the systematic review conducted for this CPG update. Thus , the Work Group decided upon a \" Weak for\" recommendation for planned deliveries for women greater than 44 years at 38 weeks. Further research is recommended to understand the mechanism behind unexplained fetal death in women of advanced maternal age, and to determine the maternal age cut -off that optimizes neonatal outcomes while minimizing maternal risk. d. History of Bariatric Surgery Recommendation s 20. We suggest that women who have undergone bariatric surgery should be evaluated for nutritional deficiencies and need for nutritional supplementation where indicated (e.g., vitamin B12, folate, iron, calcium ). ( Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) 21. For pregnant women who have undergone bariatric surgery, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine supplementation of vitamins A, D, E, or K . ( N/A | Reviewed, New- replaced) Discussion The prevalence of obesit y has doubled from 1980 to 2008 and some women are becoming pregnant after bariatric surgery. [222] As noted in the VA/DoD Obesity CPG,16 many non- surgical treatments for obesity are available ; however , obese patients are often unable to achieve substantial weight loss. Bariatric surgery has been proven to be an effective treatment for obesity . However, the impact of bariatric surgery on pregnancy has not been well studied. Pregnancies in women after bariatric surgery may need additional care other than routine prenatal care, as unique risks may be present. Bariatric surgeries may create a risk for nutritional deficiencies during pregnancy. Thus, patients may be advised to defer pregnancy for at least 18 months after surgery. Although obesity is common and utilization of bariatric surgery has been increasing , there is very little high quality evidence to support best practices during pregnanc y. In the systematic evidence review conducted for this guideline update, interventions considered for women who have undergone bariatric surgery 16 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of Obesity and Overweight. Available at: https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/CD/obesity/ VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 59 of 147 included nutritional screening, nutritional medicine referrals, nutritional management , and additional micronu trient supplementation. We suggest that women who have undergone bariatric surgery should be evaluated for nutritional deficiencies, most commonly vitamin B12, folate, iron, and calcium, and need for nutritional supplementation where indicated. The evidence supporting this recommendation was determined to be of low quality due to small sample sizes. [223, 224 ] In addition to size limitations, there was also significant non- compliance with prescribed supplement regimens and heterogeneous bariatric surgery types with some having restrictive versus malabsorptive procedures. [223] There are minimal risks and potential benefits to evaluation and supplementation for vitamin B12, folate, iron, and calcium. Additional limitations to the studies reviewed include vague description of supplementation regimens used. [223] According to the VA/DoD Obesity CPG, t he risk for nutritional deficiencies may vary depending on type of surgery performed. 17 The VA/DoD Obesity CPG states, \"Specifically after Roux- en-Y gastric bypass, several nutritional deficiencies are common and supplementation at higher than the usual recommended daily dose may be required. Typical doses of elemental calcium are 1200- 1200 mg daily, preferably as calcium citrate which is better absorbed in the absence of gastric acid. The optimal dose of vitamin B12 is not known. While all forms of delivery have been shown to be effective, poor absorption is common and sublingual or intramuscul ar injection may be required. Iron deficiency is common and typically all patients receive prophylactic therapy in conjunction with vitamin C to enhance absorption.\" In studies reviewed , there were no serious adverse events related to evaluation and supplementation. There may be potential benefits that are greater for neonatal outcomes , but study sample sizes did not provide power to demonstrate. As these are Reviewed, New -replaced recom mendations, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to these recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update.[ 223, 224] The Work Group determined confidence in the quality of the evidence was low (due to small sample sizes and vague reporting regarding supplementation regimens used ) in support of evaluatio n for nutritional deficiencies and nutritional supplementation where indicated for women who have had bariatric surgery (Recommendation 2 0). The potential for improvement in neonatal outcomes with evaluation outweig hed the potential harm of evaluation, as no serious adverse events were shown in the studies . For pregnant women who have had prior bariatric surgery, the Work Group determined that there was insufficient evidence identified in the systematic review conducted for this CPG update to recommend for or against the routine supplementation of vitamins A, D, E, or K (Recommendation 2 1). The quality of evidence was very low.[ 223, 224] When considering whether to monitor or supplement with vitamins A, D, E, or K, there is no evidence to support the ideal amount or route of supplementation or frequency. According to the National Institutes of Health, w omen who might be pregnant should not take high doses of vitamin A supplements due to risks of potential birth defects. [225] 17 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of Obesity and Overweight. Available at: https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/CD/obesity/ VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 60 of 147 Recommendations 22. We suggest that pregnant women with a history of gastric bypass surgery be evaluated by a surgeon with bariatric expertise . (Wea k for | R eviewed, Amended) Discussion There is limited research related to the nutritional management of the post -operative bariatric patient and of the patient with nutritional risk factors who is pregnant. The systematic evidence review conducted for the update of this CPG identified no evidence -based standardized practices. The VA/DoD Obesity CPG18 suggests that an \"... integrated lifestyle program for the patient should be in place, both prior to and after the surgical procedure, to provide ongoing guidance and support.\" Additionally , the VA/DoD Obesity C PG goes on to state that lifelong medical surveillance should be established for these patients to evaluate behavioral and nutritional status changes. One prospective study found that laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding prior to pregnancy was safe for both mother and newborn.[ 226] Another prospective study compared the pregnancy outcomes of women who underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding prior to pregnancy to the pregnancy outcomes of women in the general community and obese women. The outcomes of pregnant women who underweight laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding were similar to women in the general community, rather than to obese women .[ 227] Pregnant women who have undergone bariatric surgery should be evaluated by a surgeon with bariatric expertise as early as possible during the pregnancy period. Pregnant women may require evaluation for needed adjustment of the gastric band if appropriate weight gain is not developing or if there is potential band slippage . Pregnancies after laparoscopic gastric banding can result in appropriate maternal and fetal weight gain.[ 226] Pregnant women may require assessment for weight management complications, such as inadequate weight gain or excessive weight loss, behavioral evaluation, and/or nutritional deficiencies. Appointments with general/bariatric surgeons may not be feasible at all locations and, even when available, limitations include that pregnant women may have to travel for multiple appointments, or see a different provider than the surgeon who performed the surgery. In these cases , the risk must be assessed against the benefit of this consultation. Pregnant women who have undergone bariatric surgery should est ablish (or re -establish) care with an RDN to evaluate for adequate nutritional intake and potential nutritional deficiencies. Post -bariatric surgery nutritional deficiencies can be avoided with adequate dietary intake but can be readily addressed and treat ed when appropriately identified .[228] It is important to note that the VA/DoD Obesity CPG18 states: \"While evidence to support absolute contraindications for bariatric surgery is lacking, expert consensus states that women who are pregnant or who are considering pregnancy in the next 18 -24 months should not be considered candidates for bariatric surgery.\" [ 229] As this is a Reviewed, Amended recommendation , the Work Group systematically reviewed the evidence identified in the evidence review conducted for this CPG update and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2009 CPG , which included one publication from another organization .[230] They determined the evidence was of very low quality due to limited evidence and small sample size . However, 18 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of Obesity and Overweight. Available at: https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/CD/obesity/ VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 61 of 147 the potential benefits of avoiding complications outweigh the little potential harm and burden to the patient and provider of being screened. Thus, the strength of this recommendation was dete rmined to be \"Weak for .\" VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 62 of 147 Appendix A: Evidence Review Methodology A. Developing the Scope and Key Questions The CPG Champions , along with the Work Group, were tasked with identifying KQs to guide the SR of the literature on pregnancy . These questions, which were developed in consultation with the Lewin team, addressed clinical topics of the highest priority for the VA and DoD populations. The KQs follow the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework for evidence ques tions, as established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Table A -1 provides a brief overview of the PICOTS typology. Table A -1. PICOTS [231 ] P Patients, Population , or Problem A description of the patients of interest. It includes the condition(s), populations or sub- populati ons, disease severity or stage, co-occurring conditions , and other patient characteristics or demographics. I Intervention or Exposure Refers to the specific treatments or approaches used with the patient or population. It includes doses, frequency, methods of administering treatments, etc. C Comparison Describes the interventions or care that is being compared with the intervention(s) of interest described above. It includes alternatives such as placebo, drugs, surgery, lifestyle changes, standard of care, etc. O Outcome Describes the specific results of interest. Outcomes can include short, intermediate, and long - term outcomes, or specific results such as quality of life, complications, mortality, morbidity, etc. (T) Timing, if applicable Describes the duration of time that is of interest for the particular patient intervention and outcome, benefit, or harm to occur (or not occur). (S) Setting, if applicable Describes the setting or context of interest. Setting can be a location (such as primary, specialty, or inpatient care). The Champions , Work Group, and evidence review team carried out several iterations of this process, each time narrowing the scope of the CPG and the literature review by prioritizing the topics of interest. Due to resource constraints, all developed KQs were not able to be included in the systematic evidence review. Thus, the Champions and Work Group determined which questions were of highest priority, and those were included in the review. Table A-2 contains the final set of KQs used to guide the SR for this CPG. a. Population(s) Pregnant women 18 years or older treated in any VA/DoD primary care setting b.

Conducting the Systematic Review Based on the decisions made by the Champions and Work Group members regarding the scope, the KQs, and the PICOTS statements, the Lewin Team produced a systematic review protocol prior to conducting the review. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Champions and Work Group members. It described in detail the final set of KQs, the methodology to be used during the systematic review process, and the inclusion/exclusion criteria to be applied to each potential study, including, but not limited to, study type, sample size, and PICOTS criteria. Extensive literature searches identified 6,863 citations potentially addressing the KQ s of interest to this evidence review. Of those, 3,276 were excluded upon title review for clearly not meeting inclusion criteria (e.g., not pertinent to the topic, not published in English, published prior to study inclusion publication date, or not a full- length article). Overall, 3,554 abstracts were review ed with 2,677 of those being excluded f or the following reasons: not an SR or an accepted study design (see the General Criteria for Inclusion in Systematic Review and Key Question Specific Criteria ), did not address a KQ of interest to this review, did not report on an outcome of interest , or published outside cut -off publication dates. A total of 910 full-length articles were reviewed. Of those, 601 were excluded at a first pass review for the following: not addressing a KQ of interest, not enrolling the population of interest, not meeting inclusion criteria for study design, not meeting inclusion criteria for any KQ, or being a duplicate. A total of 309 full-length artic les were thought to address one or more KQs and were further reviewed . Of these, 239 were ultimately excluded. Reasons for their exclusion are presented in Figure A -1 below . Overall, 70 studies addressed one or more of the KQs and were considered as evidence in this review.

The ideal diagnosti c study compares cl inical outcomes after diagnostic technology evaluation versus clinical eval uation, or compares clinical outcomes linked to different diagnostic technologies. However, non-co mparative di agnostic studies that reported a change in management strategy or patient outcomes (e.g., evidence of organic based disease patterns) were included. Study must have enrolled at least 20 patients (10 per study group) unless otherwise noted (see Key Question Specific Criteria below). Study must have reported on an outcome of interest. Studies must h ave enrolled a patient population in which at l east 80 % of patients were pregnant at the time of enrollment. If the percentage was less than 80%, then data must have been reported separately for the patient subgroup. b.Key Question Specific Criteria For KQs 1, 4, and 6, acceptable study designs included SRs of acceptable study designs, RCTs , and diagnostic cohort studies. For KQ 4, studies examining cost effectiveness must have been prospective comparison s or cohort studies looking at diagnostic performance of one or more tests and a cost effectiveness analysis. Modeling studies using previously published or retros pectively analyzed data (e.g., from patient registries and/or Medicare payer reports) or studies using published diagnostic performance data to simulate the cost effectiveness of testing in a hypothetical cohort (i.e., no actual patient data incorporated into the model) were excluded. For KQs 2, 7, and 9, acceptable study designs included SRs of acceptable study designs, RCTs (if available), large prospective (100 patients per arm) and retrospective (200 patients per arm)cohort studies. Cohort studies must have performed multivariate analyses of the prognostic factors of interest on patient outcomes. For KQ2, studies looking at incidental use of aspirin were not included. For KQs 3, 8, and 10 acceptable study designs included SRs of RCTs and/or individual R CTs. For KQ 5, SRs of acceptable study designs and RCTs were prioritized. If insufficient evidence wasavailable to address the KQ, then large prospective (100 patients per arm) and retrospective(200 patients per arm) cohort studies were considered. Coho rt studies must have performed multivariate analyses of the prognostic factors of interest on patient outcomes.VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 71 of 147 If insufficient evidence was available to address a KQ, then large prospective (100 patients per arm) non-RCTs were considered.

C. Convening the Face -to-face Meeting In consultation with the COR , the Champions, and the Work Group, the Lewin Team convened a three and one half day face -to-face meeting of the CPG Champions and Work Group members on May 16 - 19, 2017. These experts were gathered to develop and draft the clinical recommendations for an update to the 2009 Pregnancy CPG. Lewin presented findings from the evidence review in order to fac ilitate and inform the process. Under the direction of the Champions, the Work Group members were charged with interpreting the results of the evidence review and were asked to categorize and carry forward recommendations from the 2009 Pregnancy CPG, modifying the recommendations as necessary . The members also developed new clinical practice recommendations not presented in the 2009 Pregnancy CPG based on the 2017 evidence review. The subject matter experts were divided into two smaller subgroups at this meeting. As the Work Group members drafted clinical practice recommendations, they also assigned a grade for each recommendation based on a modified GRADE and USPSTF methodology. Each recommendation was graded by assessing the quality of the overall evidence base, the associated benefits and harms, the variation in values and preferences, and other implications of the recommendation . In addition to developing recommendations during the face -to-face meeting, the Work Group members also revised the 2009 Pregnancy CPG algorithms to reflect the new and amended recommendations. They discussed the available evidence as well as changes in clinical practice since 2009, as necessary, to update the algorithms. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 72 of 147 D. Grading Recommendations This CPG uses the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a strength for each recommendation. The GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each recommendation: [232] Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes Confidence in the quality of the evidence Values and preferences Other implications, as appropriate, e.g.,: Resource u se Equity Acceptability Feasibility Subgroup considerations Th e following sections further describe each domain. Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes refers to the size of anticipated benefits (e.g., increased longevity, reduction in morbid event, resolution of symptoms, improved quality of life , decreased resource use) and harms (e.g., decreased longevity, immediate serious complications, adverse event, impaired quality of life, increased resource use, inconvenience/hassle) relative to each other. This domain is based on the understanding that the majority of clinicians will offer patients therapeutic or preventive measures as long as the advantages of the intervention exceed the risks and adverse effects. The certainty or uncertainty of the clinician about the risk -benefit balance will greatly influence the strength of the recommendation. Some of the discussion questions that fall under this domain include: Given the best estimate of typical values and preferences, are you confident that the benefits outweigh the harms and burden or vice versa? Are the desirable anticipated effects large? Are the undesirable anticipated effects small? Are the desirable effects large relative to undesirable effects? C onfidence in the quality of the evidence reflects the quality of the evidence base and the certainty in that evidence. This second domain reflects the methodological quality of the studies for each outcome variable. In general, the strength of recommendation follows the level of evidence, but not always, as other domains may increase or decrease the strength. The evidence review used for the development of recommendations , conducted by ECRI, assessed the confidence in the quality of the evidence base using GRADE methodology and assigned a rat ing of \"High,\" \"Moderate ,\" \"Low ,\" or \"Very Low .\" VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 73 of 147 The elements that go into the confidence in the quality of the evidence include: Is there high or moderate quality evidence that answers this question? What is the overall certainty of this evidence? Val ues and preferences is an overarching term that includes patients' perspectives, beliefs, expectations, and goals for health and life. More precisely, it refers to the processes that individuals use in considering the potential benefits, harms, costs, limitations, and inconvenience of the therapeutic or preventive measures in relation to one another. For some, the term \"values\" has the closest connotation to these processes. For others, the connot ation of \"preferences\" best captures the notion of choice. In general, values and preferences increase the strength of the recommendation when there is high concordance and decrease it when there is great variability. In a situation in which the balance of benefits and risks are uncertain, eliciting the values and preferences of patients and empowering them and their surrogates to make decisions consistent with their goals of care becomes even more important. A recommendation can be described as having \"sim ilar values ,\" \"some variation, \" or \"large variation\" in typical values and preferences between patients and the larger populations of interest. Some of the discussion questions that fall under the purview of values and preferences include: Are you confiden t about the typical values and preferences and are they similar across the target population? What are the patient's values and preferences? Are the assumed or identified relative values similar across the target population? Ot her implications consider the practicality of the recommendation, including resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility and subgroup considerations. Resource use is related to the uncertainty around the cost -effectiveness of a therapeutic or preventive measure. For example statin use in the frail elderly and others with multiple co -occurring conditions may not be effective and , depending on the societal benchmark for willingness to pay, may not be a good use of resources. Equity, acceptability, feasibility , and subgroup considera tions require similar judgments around the practically of the recommendation. The framework below ( Table A -4) was used by the Work Group to guide discussions on each domain. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 74 of 147 Table A -4. GRADE Evidence to Recommendation Framework Decision Domain Questions to Consider Judgment Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes Given the best estimate of typical values and preferences, are you confident that the benefits outweigh the harms and burden or vice versa? Are the desirable anticipated effects large? Are the undesirable anticipated effects small? Are the desirable effects large relative to undesirable effects? Benefits outweigh harms/burden Benefits slightly outweigh harms/ burden Benefits and harms/burden are balanced Harms/ burden slightly outweigh benefits Harms/burden outweigh benefits Confidence in the quality of the evidence Is there high or moderate quality evidence that answers this question? What is the overall certainty of this evidence? High Moderate Low Very low Values and preferences Are you confident about the typical values and preferences and are they similar across the target population? What are the patient's values and preferences? Are the assumed or identified relative values similar across the target population? Similar values Some variation Large variation Other implications (e.g., resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations) Are the resources worth the expected net benefit from the recommendation? What are the costs per resource unit? Is this intervention generally available? Is this intervention and its effects worth withdrawing or not allocating resources from other interventions? Is there lots of variability in resource requirements across settings? Various considerations The strength of a recommendation is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects and is based on the framework above, which combines the four domains. [233] GRADE methodology does not allow for recommendations to be made based on expert opinion alone. While strong recommendations are usually based on high or moderate confidence in the estimates of effect (quality of the evidence) there may be instances where strong recommendations are warranted even when the quality of evidence is low. [ 232] In these types of instances where the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes and values and preferences played large roles in determining the strength of a recommendation, this is explained in the discussion section for the recommendation. The GRADE of a recommendation is based on the following elements: Four decision domains used to determine the strength and direct ion (described above) Relative strength (Strong or Weak) Direction (For or Against) VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 75 of 147 The relative strength of the recommendation is based on a binary scale, \"Strong\" or \"Weak.\" A strong recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a weak recommendation. Similarly, a recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendation against a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences. Occasionally, instances may occur when the Work Group feels there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against a particular therapy or preventive measure. This can occur when there is an absence of studies on a particular topic that met evidence review inclusion criteria, studies inc luded in the evidence review report conflicting results, or studies included in the evidence review report inconclusive results regarding the desirable and undesirable outcomes. Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum: Strong For (or \"We recommend offering this option ...\") Weak For (or \"We suggest offering this option ...\") No recommendation for or against (or \"There is insufficient evidence...\") Weak Against (or \"We suggest not offering this option ...\") Strong Against (or \"We recommend against offering this option ...\") N ote that weak (For or Against) recommendations may also be termed \"Conditional,\" \"Discretionary,\" or \"Qualified.\" Recommendations may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented. Recommendations may be at the discretion of the patient and clinician or they may be qualified with an explanation about the issues that would lead decisions to vary. E. Recommendation Categorization a. Recommendation Categories and Definitions A set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by NICE .[27,28] These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which recommendations could have been updated from the 2009 Pregnancy CPG. The categories and definitions can be found in Table A-5 . VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 76 of 147 Table A-5. Recommendation Categories and Definitions Evidence Reviewed* Recommendation Category* Definition* Reviewed New -added New recommendation following review of the evidence New -replaced Recommendation from previous CPG that has been carried over to the updated CPG that has been changed following review of the evidence Not changed Recommendation from previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG where the evidence has been reviewed but the recommendation is not changed Amended Recommendation from the previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG where the evidence has been reviewed and a minor amendment has been made Deleted Recommendation from the previous CPG that has been removed based on review of the evidence Not reviewed Not changed Recommendation from previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG, but for which the evidence has not been reviewed Amended Reco mmendation from the previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG where the evidence has not been reviewed and a minor amen dment has been made Deleted Recommendation from the previous CPG that has been removed because it was deemed out of scope for the updated CPG *Adapted from the NICE guideline manual (2012) [ 27] and Garcia et al. (2014) [28] Abbreviation: CPG: clinical practice guideline b. Categorizing Recommendations with an Updated Review of the Evidence Recommendations were first categorized by whether or not they were based on a n updated review of the evidence. If evidence had been reviewed, recommendations were categorized as \"New -added\" recommendations were original, new recommendations that were not in the 2009 Pregnancy CPG. \"Reviewed, New- replaced\" recommendations were in the previous version of the guideline, but were modified to align with the updated review of the evidence. These recommendations could have also included clinically significant changes to the previous version. Recommendations categorized as \"Reviewed, Not changed\" were carried forward from the previous version of the CPG unchanged. To maintain consistency between 2009 recommendations, which were developed using the U SPSTF methodology, and 201 8 recommendations, which were developed using the GRADE methodology, it was necessary to modify the 2009 recommendations to include verbiage to signify the strength of the recommendation (e.g., \"We recommend,\" \"We suggest\"). Because the 2009 recommendations inherently needed to be modified at least slightly to include this language, the \"Not changed\" category was not used. For recommendations carried forward to the updated CPG with review of the evidence and slightly modified wording, the \"Reviewed, Amended\" recommendation category was used. This allowed for the wording of the recommendation to reflect GRADE methodology as well as for any other non -substantive (i.e., not clinically meaningful) lan guage changes deemed necessary. The evidence used to support these VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 77 of 147 recommendations was carried forward from the previous version of the CPG and/or was identified in the evidence review for the update. Recommendations could have also been designated \"Reviewed, Deleted.\" These were recommendations from the previous version of the CPG that were not brought forward to the updated guideline after review of the evidence. This occurred if the evidence supporting the recommendations was out of date, to the extent that there was no longer a ny basis to recommend a particular course of care and/or new evidence suggests a shift in care, rendering recommendations in the previous version of the guideline obsolete. c. Categorizing Recommendations without an Updated Review of the Evidence There wer e also cases in which it was necessary to carry forward recommendations from the previous version of the CPG without an updated SR of the evidence. Due to time and budget constraints, the update of the Pregnancy CPG could not review all available evidence on management of pregnancy , but instead focused its KQs on areas of new or updated scientific research or areas that were not previously covered in the CPG. For areas of research that have not changed, and for which recommendations made in the previous version of the guideline were still relevant, recommendations could have been carried forward to the updated guideline without an updated SR of the evidence. The support for these recommendations in the updated CPG was thus also carried forward from the prev ious version of the CPG. These recommendations were categorized as \"Not reviewed.\" If evidence had not been reviewed, recommendations could have been categorized as \"Not changed,\" \" Amended,\" or \"Deleted.\" \"Not reviewed, Not changed\" recommendations refer to recommendations from the previous version of the Pregnancy CPG that were carried forward unchanged to the updated version. The category of \"Not reviewed, Amended\" was used to designate recommendations which were modified from the 2009 Pregnancy with the updated GRADE language, as explained above. Recommendations could also have been categorized as \"Not reviewed, Deleted\" if they were determined to be out of scope. A recommendation was out of scope if it pertained to a topic ( e.g., population, c are setting, treatment, and condition) outside of the scope for the updated CPG as defined by the Work Group. The categories for the recommendations included in the 2018 version of the guideline are noted in the Recom mendations . The categories for the recommendations from the 2009 Pregnancy CPG are noted in Appendix D. F. Drafting and Submitting the Final Clinical Practice Guideline Following the face -to-face meeting, the Champions and Work Group members were given writing assignments to craft discussion sections to support each of the new recommendations and/or to update discussion sections from the 2009 Pregnancy CPG to support the amended \"carried forward\" recommendations. The Work Group also considered tables, appendices, and other sections from the 2009 Pregnancy CPG for inclusion in the update. During this time, the Champions and Work Group also made additional revisions to the algorithms, as necessary. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 78 of 147 After developing the initial draft of the updated CPG, an iterative review process was used to solicit feedback on and make revisions to the CPG. Once they were developed, the first two drafts of the CPG were posted on a wiki website for a period of 14 -20 business days for internal review and comment by the Work Group. All feedback submitted during each review period was reviewed and discussed by the Work Group and appropriate revisions were made to the CPG. Draft 3 of the CPG was made available for peer review and comment. This process is described in the section titled Peer Review Process . After revisions were made based on the feedback received during the peer review and comment period, the Champions presented the CPG to the EBPWG f or their approval. Changes were made based on feedback from the EBPWG and the guideline was finalized. The Work Group also produced a set of guideline toolkit materials which included a provider summary, pocket card, and patient summary. The final 201 8 Pregnancy CPG was submitted to the EBPWG in March 2018. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 79 of 147 Appendix B: Patient Focus Group Methods and Findings A. Methods As part of the effort to update this CPG, the VA and DoD Leadership held two patient focus groups. The first was held on December 1, 2016 at the Washington DC VA Medical Center in Washington, DC. The second was held on February 2, 2017 at Malco lm Grow Medical Clinics and Surgery Center at Joint Base Andrews, MD. The aim of the focus groups was to further understand and incorporate the perspe ctive of patients covered and/or receiving their care through the VA and/or DoD healthcare systems during their pregnancy and perinatal period, as patients are most affected by the recommendations put forth in the CPG. The focus groups delved into the pati ents' perspectives on a set of topics related to their pregnancy care, including their priorities, challenges they have experienced, and the information they received regarding their pregnancy care, as well as the impacts of their pregnancy and their pregn ancy care on their lives. Participants for the focus group were recruited by VA and DoD Leadership as well as by the Pregnancy CPG Champions. Patient focus group participants were not designed to be a representative sample of VA and DoD pregnant patients . However, recruitment focused on eliciting a range of perspectives likely to be relevant and informative in the guideline development process. Patients were not incentivized for their participation or reimbursed for travel expenses. The Pregnancy CPG Champ ions and Work Group, with support from Lewin, developed a set of questions to help guide the focus group. The focus group facilitator led the discussion using the previously prepared questions as a general guide to elicit the most important information from the patients regarding their experiences and views about their treatment and overall care. Given the limited time and the range of interests of the focus group participants, not all of the listed questions were addressed. Four patients participated in the focus groups with two patients participat ing in each session. Two participants had received care through the DoD healthcare system and two received care from community providers through the VA. B. Patient Focus Group Findings a. Recognize the importance of a support network throughout pregnancy, including as a trusted source of information specific to a patient's unique pregnancy experience (e.g., as a first -time parent or Active Duty Service Member) Patients, particularly those receiving care through t he DoD, seemed to lack a network that they could trust and rely upon for support, leaving them with a sense of isolation. They indicated that support groups organized through the VA and DoD could be helpful in providing this network. Patients desired more information about their unique experience of being pregnant, e.g., as a first-time parent or an Active Duty Service Member of the military, that could help them feel prepared throughout their pregnancy and when their baby arrived. Patients valued the support they received from their families, friends, and colleagues during their pregnancy, and advised offering more formal support groups to enhance the patients' networks and share information. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 80 of 147 b. Provide information regarding general pregnancy care to the patient in a timely manner and in a way that is responsive to the patients' goals, values, and preferences Patients desired reliable sources of information related to pregnancy, including information regarding their health and the healt h of their babies during pregnancy . Patients appreciated variation in the comprehensiveness, portability, and connectivity of multiple sources of information that could be useful in different circumstances (e.g., handbook, mobile application, and pamphlet ). Patients appreciated the information they received regarding general pregnancy care, but noted that more information was needed regarding their specific situations (e.g., as a Veteran, Active Duty Service Member, or beneficiary of a Service Member). c. Provide comprehensive, understandable information regarding covered services to the patient and help the patient navigate that information and answer questions as needed Patients desired formal, reliable and easy to navigate sources of information relate d to pregnancy, including comprehensive information regarding their covered services . Patients noted limitations and inconsistency in VA/DoD coverage of pregnancy -related services and supplies based on the information available to them and encouraged cons idering expansions in this coverage. d. Recognize the importance of the relationship between the patient and her provider and care team and the necessity for the patient to have consistency in this relationship and her access to care Patients valued open a nd trusting relationships with familiar pregnancy healthcare providers and care teams. Patients valued the consistency in their relationships with their providers throughout their pregnancies and deliveries. Patients recognized the importance of a discussion regarding contingency plans in the event of a sudden or precipitous delivery necessitating an unfamiliar provider and wanted reassurance that their care would still be carried out smoothly. e. Ensure that the family is involved in the pregnancy in accordance with pat ient preferences and recognize the differences among families in structure and composition Patients expressed the desire for their family to be involved in their pregnancy and for their providers and care teams to support their preferenc es regarding involving family members in their care. Patients noted differences in structure and composition across families and the need for VA and DoD healthcare services to recognize and appreciate these differences as they deliver care for pregnant wo men and their families. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy March 2018 Page 81 of 147 f. Ensure that patients know the options for pediatric healthcare and day care early in their pregnancy and provide information so that they can feel secure in their planning Patients did not receive adequate formal information regarding pediatric care for their newborns or how to identify healthcare providers for their children. Patients were not aware of the day care options available and advised that this topic be broached early in a patient's pregnancy to allow adequate time to plan. g. Improve communication and information sharing between VA and community providers to ensure patients receive the individualized care they need without undue stress Patients stressed the need for improved communication and information sharing (e.g. , billing information, medical records) between the VA and the community providers under the Choice Program. Patients valued their care from the community providers, but indicated that community providers need to be better educated regarding military culture and potential exposures that could impact the health of Veterans and military personnel. Patients recognized the importance of their geographic location in receiving their care as planned during their delivery and valued the planning and communication needed to adjust the birth plan as needed during their deliveries.

Inclusion of more than one 2009 Grade indicates that more than one 2009 CPG recommendation is covered under the 2018 recommendation. The strength of recommendations were rated as follows: A - a strong recommendation that the clinicians provide the intervention to eligible patients; B - a recommendation that clinicians provide (the service) to eligible patients; C - no recommendation for or against the routine provision of the intervention is made; D - recommendation is mad e against routinely providing the intervention; I - the conclusion is that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routinely providing the intervention. \"Not applicable\" indicates that the 2018 Pregnancy CPG recommendation was a new recommendation, and therefore does not have an associated 2009 Grade. 2 The first set of references listed in each row in the evidence column constitutes the evidence base for the recommendation. To be included in the evidence base for a recommendation, a reference needed to be identified through the 2017 evidence review or included in the evidence base for the 2009 VA/DoD Pregnancy CP G. The second set of references in the evidence column (called \"Additional References\") includes references that provide additional information related to the recommendation, but which were not systematically identified through a literature review . These references were not included in the evidence base for the recommendation and therefore did not influence the strength and direction of the recommendation. 3 Refer to the Grading Recommendations section for more information on how the strength of the recommendation was determined using GRADE methodology . 4 Refer to the Recommendation Categorization section for more information on the description of the categorization process and the definition of each category.
