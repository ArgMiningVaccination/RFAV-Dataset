A daily dose of Love is one of the most important nutrients for optimum health. This vital human emotion and experience are necessary for the optimal functioning of people and all of their cells, tissues, and organs. Vitamin L can be found anywhere \u2014 in grandma's kitchen, your pet, friends, or family. And it can be used to heal a wide variety of illness. There are no toxic effects, but deficiency can cause a wide range of ailments. Where is it found? As stated, vitamin L is found in a great variety of sources but must be developed and nurtured to be available. Fear, anger, worry, self-concern, and many other human emotions can destroy vitamin L. It is found readily in most moms and dads and is very highly concentrated in grandmas and grandpas. Sisters and brothers can be a good source of vitamin L, although often this is covered up in early years, developed in the teens, and more readily available in adulthood. Vitamin L is also found in cats, dogs, and horses, in flowers and birds, and in trees and plants. In food, it is especially found in home-cooked meals where vitamin L is used consciously as an ingredient. [Massage therapy](/massage) is particularly good source of Vitamin L. Why is Vitamin L good for me? Vitamin L acts as the \"universal\" vitalizing energy for optimal wellness. It helps to catalyze all human functions and is particularly important to heart function and the circulation of warmth and joy. Digestion is very dependent on appropriate doses of vitamin L, as is the function of the nervous system. That floating on air sensation you feel after a massage? You can thank Vitamin L because it elevates levels of serotonin and dopamine. Serotonin can help you maintain a balanced mood, and the increase in dopamine can help you be productive and focused. Not to mention the \"love\" hormone itself: [oxytocin](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/oxytocin-the-love-hormone). Levels of oxytocin and your body's natural endorphins increase after a massage and can cause feelings of centeredness and bliss leading to a deep sense of safety and resilience. How is Vitamin L used? Vitamin L is an important nutrient in all human relationships. If we could, we should put it in the drinking supply. It is a vital ingredient that all health practitioners \u2014 doctors, clinics, hospitals, etc. \u2014 should have readily available. It can pass through the healer's energy vibrations to the recipient. It can be used in all heart problems and a wide variety of medical conditions. Vitamin L therapy is also particularly helpful in all kinds of psychological problems: depression, sadness, anger, fear, worry, pain, concern over world affairs, and many stresses of life. Fear, one of the more difficult problems to treat, usually requires megadoses of vitamin L, as does greed.
