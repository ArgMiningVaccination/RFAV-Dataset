The headache, fatigue, aches and chills are a result of an inflammatory response that happens \"as the immune system sends the soldiers in to encounter the vaccine and begin to respond to it,\" Schaffner explains. So the systemic reactions \"are already your immune system starting to rev up,\" he adds. Over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin or antihistamines can help with any post-vaccine pain or discomfort. The CDC says individuals [can take these medications](/health/conditions-treatments/info-2021/covid-vaccine-medication-interaction.html) as long as there's no other medical reason that would prevent them from taking them normally, although it's always a good idea to check with your doctor.

Schaffner says there's some data that suggest taking a pain-relieving medication before your shot can weaken your immune response, so \"out of an excess of caution\" it's best to wait. And any irritation or discomfort in the arm where you got the shot can be eased with a clean, cool, wet washcloth, the CDC says. Preparing for possible side effects If you are prone to dizzy spells or have trouble with balance, go to your appointment with \"someone who can hold your arm,\" Schaffner says, referring to the CDC report that listed dizziness as a common side effect from the shots. Making sure you're well hydrated before your vaccine can also help offset any lightheadedness. \"And remember, one of the good things is you will be observed for at least 15 minutes afterward. So you'll be sitting down in an area just beyond where you were vaccinated, and you can compose yourself and relax,\" he adds. In most cases, vaccine-related side effects fade after a few days \u2014 typically one to three days after onset. However, if they linger or worry you, contact your doctor. The same goes if the redness or tenderness where you got the shot gets worse after 24 hours, the CDC advises. An important thing to keep in mind: In comparison to COVID, any side effects from the vaccines \"are really very trivial,\" Schaffner says. \"It is a very modest price to pay if you do have some transient side effects, in order to protect ourselves against a virus that really could put any of us into the intensive care unit within 48 hours.\" Rachel Nania writes about health care and health policy for AARP.
