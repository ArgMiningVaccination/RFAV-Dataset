SPIRITUAL NUTRITION COUNSELING I'm committed to freeing you from unwholesome cycles. I'm here for you and I know your pain. I've seen and experienced what can happen when you live, eat, and love without proper guidance and knowledge. WHAT IS SPIRITUAL NUTRITION COUNSELING? With Spiritual Nutrition everything is connected: your mind, body, and spirit. Healing is your birth-right and learning how to heal yourself is part of life. Together, we will bring your whole-self back into balance by allowing it to do what it does best: heal itself. I counsel people who are dealing with blood sugar, digestion, drug addiction, depression, hormonal imbalances, diabetes and chronic sickness. If you're already working with a medical doctor, partnering with a Spiritual Nutrition Counselor can help accelerate the healing process. While our immediate focus is on your individual health goals, our ultimate goal is a more conscious world. HOW DOES SPIRITUAL COUNSELING WORK? Over the course of our journey together, we will create a customized plan for your rapid healing, deep re-nourishment, and vibrant wellness. Together we will: Find, understand and cleanse the underlying patterns that keep you feeling heavy, stressed and sick. Identify and release these patterns on all levels to free you and bring you back to radiant wholeness. Create a step-by-step plan where you will gain confidence and celebrate your ability to trust, nourish and care for yourself. Enter deeply into your mind structure, flow, and routines of your life to recreate them in a way that truly helps you thrive. Sometimes we will laugh, sometimes we will cry, but I won't let you fall, and I am committed to helping you fulfill your purpose. We can work on just about anything you want \u2014 as long as you're willing to do the work and take personal responsibility for your health. From you, I also learned how to release the past so that I can move forward. You helped me to shed the skin that was no longer serving me.\" - SAMANTHA BONANO Culinary Nutritionist/Holistic Chef WHO SHOULD RECEIVE SPIRITUAL NUTRITION COUNSELING?

SPIRITUAL NUTRITION COUNSELING FAQ Not at all! I advocate for a fresh, organic, raw, and vegan food lifestyle. However, I'm never going to \"force\" you to eat something you don't desire. I'll teach you what I've learned over many years, empower you to make the changes you're looking for and respect your choices. There are over 20,000 species of edible plants in the world, so I can assure you'll never be hungry or bored! I work with my students face-to-face and online in Spanish and English. Both ways work beautifully, it just depends on what you want, need and where you are. Some of my clients meet with me virtually, two to four times a month. Others fly me to their homes for week-long, lifestyle-transforming intensives. A few of my clients have booked me to train their private chefs, onsite. Others prefer to meet me at my studio in Miami Beach, Florida where we can play in my kitchen and state-of-the-art fitness room. (I can bring a private Pilates instructor into the studio, to guide you through a phenomenal workout after our counseling session!). We'll work out the logistics during our first consultation. Cookbooks & guidebooks are fantastic. My kitchen is full of them! But a cookbook isn't going to text you on the morning of your huge presentation to remind you to take your supplements. A cookbook isn't going to drive to your home to supervise you while you clear out your fridge, and then take you shopping for fresh, healthy treats. A cookbook isn't going to individualize your meal plan, based on your exact body constitution & metabolic profile. But I will. So, if you want the kind of support that goes above & beyond a cookbook, then you need me. A non-toxic, whole foods diet has been proven to reduce chronic stress & inflammation, two of the root causes of most diseases. I do this through the Nurturing Non-Toxic Nest method. I believe your home can be a sanctuary of healing. Comprehensive guidance can help you create a toxin-free home that nourishes your body and soul. I'll show you how to remove hidden environmental stressors so you can stop fighting an invisible battle and finally rest into your wellness and wholeness. Your kitchen is a sanctuary to me. There is a special essence in your kitchen, that makes me want to learn and be healthier. I feel privileged to participate and I have learned so much through the years. Your recipes are superb!! \" - DR. ETTI.COM Juicing Goddess, Partner in Dr Smood and Ph.D in Holistic Nutrition. I'm committed to help you achieve holistic health and make it accessible to you.
