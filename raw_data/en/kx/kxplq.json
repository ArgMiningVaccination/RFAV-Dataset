For Mesoamerican cultures, the use of temazcal \u2014dating back 1,200 years\u2014 represented more than a cleansing ritual; it was intimately linked to their cosmogony and their relationship with the divine. Historians debate about the Nahuatl origin of this word, but two theories stand out: First: \"Tema\" \u2014 steam, and \"calli\" \u2014 house. Second: \"Tetl\" \u2014 stone, \"mazitli\" \u2014 hot, and \"calli\" \u2014 house. From either point of view, the accurate definition for temazcales is Steam bath houses. SYMBOLOGY IN A TEMAZCAL According to Ana Quintana, Spa Specialist at Solmar's Spas, there is a symbolism behind the architectural structure of these sweat lodges, with the entrance oriented to the east, in order to receive the first rays of the sun. \"The building, with its vaulted ceiling and dirt floor, represents the Mother Earth's womb. The steam that emerges from the center when spraying water over the hot stones, embodies the purification process\". At Solmar's Temazcal, the Aztec tradition is followed together with the meaningful symbology used by this culture: \"The relentless Life-Death-Life cycle takes shape in this ceremony in which the four elements are combined to result in a process of transformation, health and well-being\", adds Ana. ANCIENT RITUAL FOR MIND-BODY-SOUL BALANCE An altar dedicated to deities of Nature, so present in ancient indigenous cosmogony, receives you to give start with the ceremony at the sound of seashell horn whistling. Copal is used to cleanse mind, body and spirit before entering the lodge, where a guided transformation process takes place.
