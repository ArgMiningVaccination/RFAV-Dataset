In that time, the world has seen unprecedented advances: humanity has been connected digitally, financially and through trade and integrated value chains. Yet progress is threatened by critical global risks, deep fissures have split global society and a tidal wave of technologically-driven change - the Fourth Industrial Revolution - is breaking over history. The need for global cooperation has never been greater, yet frameworks of governance and the rules-based order are under threat. Since the founding of the Forum, our objective has been consistent: to be the world's foremost platform to shape global, regional and industry agendas through multistakeholder engagement. First, through the course of the 1970s, the Forum established its convening power; in the next phase, we focused our efforts on building communities of leaders in business, government and civil society; later, we developed a strong internal knowledge base resulting in numerous reports; and, most recently, we have built sustained impact through a thriving portfolio of multistakeholder projects. When combined together, these capabilities have established our unique global position and strengthened the trust of our stakeholders in our capability to act as a platform for interaction and evidence-based impact. All this time, the Forum has been striving for a position of excellence committed to improving the state of the world . Today, the Forum is making its most significant transition to reflect our new status as the International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation . As such, it will provide what could be termed the \"operating system for global cooperation\". The ambition for the coming years is to integrate all our communities and capabilities into a focused effort to establish new systems of national, regional and global cooperation that preserve the successes the world has achieved and address the challenges it faces. This new forward-looking framework must not only reflect the fact that the world has moved from a unipolar to a multipolar system, it must also be capable of integrating different political, economic and social systems while recognizing basic values that are essential to harmonious global coexistence. In addition, this framework must also integrate the concerns of all the segments of the global population that feel left out. This can only be achieved by creating platforms that integrate all parts of society into our collaborative efforts. To achieve this ambitious objective, this year the Forum underwent a major strategic transformation to make it fit for purpose as an international organization designed for the 21st century: agile, multistakeholder, forward-looking and solutions- oriented. We are critically aware that, in today's complex world, challenges can be addressed only if placed within the larger context of political, economic, technological, governance and social interrelationships. I am grateful to my 800 colleagues at the Forum, and particularly to all the stakeholders in government, international organizations, business, civil society and academia who support us and engage directly in our activities to achieve our ambitious mission.Klaus Schwab Founder and Executive Chairman Annual Report 2017-2018 45 Annual Report 2017-2018 -Centre for Global Public Goods : to accelerate and amplify the global business community's engagement to formulate solutions to systemic issues, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change. The World Economic Forum Sustainable Development Impact Summit, launched this past fiscal year, has proved to be a major action- oriented contribution to making the world safer, cleaner and more inclusive. - Centre for the New Economy and Society : to create concepts for economic and social policy- making that reflect and adapt to the fast-moving transformation of the global economic and social systems, based on the Forum's recognized work in competitiveness, gender parity, the future of work and skills development. The Forum also introduced two major new endeavours this year: - Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network : to co- design and pilot the principles and protocols that govern emerging technologies. Following the establishment of the Centre in San Francisco, work began on rolling out a global network that includes Centres in Japan (Tokyo), operational in July 2018, and in The year was marked by strong achievement, even by the standards of an organization in which exceptional performance is the rule. Working to deliver against ambitious targets, the World Economic Forum's team of over 700 collaborators around the world remained conscious of the long-term mission: to build a new kind of international organization, one that is multistakeholder-based, multidisciplinary, agile, top-level and enduring. It is a pioneering mission that endeavours to create lasting yet agile structures that can respond to the ever-changing and challenging environment that affects all stakeholders in the quest for a positive future. Efforts this year were focused on strategic priorities, including restructuring the Forum's core activities into four interdependent Centres: - Centre for Global Industries : to continue to shape industry agendas for public-private cooperation in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by new competitive forces and a rapidly evolving business environment. - Centre for Regional and Geopolitical Affairs : to intensify Forum efforts to be a major partner in building strong and prosperous regions by strengthening the focus on peace-building, reconciliation and humanitarian efforts. A Year of Transformation: Building Our Platform for the Future By B\u00f8rge Brende , President, and the Managing Board , W. Lee Howell, Jeremy Jurgens, Cheryl Martin, Adrian Monck, Murat S\u00f6nmez and Alois Zwinggi India (Mumbai) and China (Beijing), planned for the second half of 2018. - Centre for Cybersecurity : to provide an independent and impartial platform to build and maintain global trust between the public and private sectors in addressing cyberthreats, and to reduce the overall cyberattack surface, contain attacks and deter malicious actors. Key governments, such as China, Russia and the United States, as well as key businesses are already engaged. Focus was placed on expanding the Forum's platform structures to enable its stakeholders to integrate their own initiatives or engage in collaborative projects based on their priorities. This design principle is key to empowering Forum Members to integrate their own initiatives, leveraging the depth and breadth of the Forum's network, convening power, and intellectual and digital strength, thus ensuring that the commitment to improving the state of the world is not limited only to Forum- led initiatives. The goal by 2020 is for 80% of the initiatives on the Forum platform to be externally led, from 39% today. The business community's continuous and deep engagement is critical to achieving the Forum's mission. Over the past year, the number of Partners increased by 6%, and 93% of Annual Report 2017-20186 To support the World Economic Forum's positioning as a distinctive partner of business, government and civil society, public engagement activities were further developed over the past year. The Forum is the most often mentioned international organization in print media, and the most active on social media. The Forum's strategic insight capabilities were enhanced, as evidenced by the publication of more than 80 reports. It also established a Global Leadership Institute to help strengthen and stimulate the mindset, skill set and toolkits needed to lead in the age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and beyond. To be a leader in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the Forum continues its pioneering work in curating platforms and exercising systems leadership by developing proprietary knowledge and interaction tools such as TopLink and Transformation Maps.Partners renewed their engagement, reflecting the international business community's commitment to and expectations from the Forum as a global platform of interaction, insight and impact. Deep, broad and continuous engagement with the top government leaders has become ever more critical and imperative in times of accelerating dislocation and fragmentation, as geopolitical affairs intensify unpredictably in the context of profound and rapid change. This year, the Forum took important additional steps to establish itself as a platform for peace and reconciliation, building an intensive set of informal diplomatic dialogues by placing the Forum at the service of the international community. The effectiveness of this approach was reflected in the record participation of over 80 heads of state in the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2018 in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland. Achieving the Forum's mission relies on the people and culture of the organization. One of the most critical priorities of the Managing Board was to further strengthen the Forum's operational and cultural foundations to act as the global trailblazer in systems leadership through public-private cooperation. This report outlines achievements that resulted from efforts over the past 12 months. It highlights some of the outcomes that marked this year as one of the most successful in the Forum's 49-year history, as much an indication of the Forum's diversity of activities as the significance of its impact. 7 Annual Report 2017-2018A New Kind of International Organization As the International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation, the World Economic Forum serves the international community by providing a platform for advancing systemic improvements in cooperation and governance through the engagement of multiple stakeholders, industries, technologies, regions and intellectual disciplines. By Richard Samans Managing Director, Head of Policy and Institutional Impact Annual Report 2017-20188 The Forum is working to expand the geometry of international cooperation at a time when a more interdependent and multipolar world is facing important challenges that no single set of actors can resolve alone, and for which the business community has critical capabilities that need to be brought to the table. The Forum engages its numerous communities in different modes of public-private cooperation corresponding to its Centres, aiming to inspire and enable them to collaborate in ways that shape global, regional and industry agendas in a positive direction. The Centres seek to maximize their impact by exercising system leadership - improving cooperation at an ecosystem-wide rather than solely project-specific level - by: - Curating communities of interest and purpose across industries, technologies, stakeholders, regions and intellectual disciplines (system integration) - Enabling these communities with the support of our knowledge, convening and project facilitation capabilities to identify systemic gaps in cooperation and innovate multistakeholder collaborations to address them (system activation and optimization) - Providing a platform that makes it easier for community members to create their own multistakeholder projects on a self-organized, distributed basis by providing them greater access to Forum networks, digital tools, events and communications (system scaling) Multilateral and other intergovernmental institutions and arrangements remain the cornerstone of global governance. But their effectiveness can often be enhanced by embedding them in broader networks that harness multistakeholder and multidisciplinary expertise and resources in self- associating coalitions of actors working to accelerate progress where they believe it is most needed and attainable. Through their ecosystem and platform approach, the Forum's Centres and 14 System Initiatives are designed to add a more networked and multidimensional dimension to existing efforts in their respective fields. This includes helping to expand the capacity of formal intergovernmental institutions and arrangements to integrate the capabilities of business, civil society and academia, along the way improving the scale, innovation and efficiency of global governance and cooperation. The growing contribution of public- private cooperation to international governance poses no inherent threat to the role of states and intergovernmental institutions. To the contrary, in many cases it holds the key to accelerating the implementation of the norms, goals and principles states have established. For this reason, the Forum's strategy is to place each of these thematic public-private ecosystems (each Centre and Initiative) more readily at the service of the international community by creating strong links between them and the relevant intergovernmental organization(s). Going forward, the objective is to make a further contribution by helping to connect the dots across these specialized communities and institutions in ways that strengthen the performance and coherence of the international system as a whole. The inaugural Sustainable Development Impact Summit process represents an important first step in this direction. The Summit is a gathering of the World Economic Forum during the United Nations General Assembly in New York to spotlight and expand promising multistakeholder initiatives worldwide System Initiatives are designed to add a more networked and multidimensional aspect to existing efforts in their respective fields Centre for Global Industries - Shaping the Future of Consumption - Shaping the Future of Digital Economy and Society - Shaping the Future of Energy - Shaping the Future of Financial and Monetary Systems - Shaping the Future of Health and Healthcare - Shaping the Future of Information and Entertainment - Shaping the Future of Long-Term Investing, Infrastructure and Development - Shaping the Future of Mobility - Shaping the Future of Production Centre for Global Public Goods - Shaping the Future of the Environment and Natural Resource Security - Shaping the Future of Food Centre for the New Economy and Society - Shaping the Future of Economic Progress - Shaping the Future of Education, Gender and Work Policy and Institutional Impact Group - Shaping the Future of International Trade and Investment149 Annual Report 2017-2018that advance the implementation of the multidisciplinary 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement on climate change. This Summit and its preparatory process aim to provide the international community with an ongoing, cross-cutting approach to expand countries' application of public-private partnerships and advanced technologies to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) and climate change plans. Technology cooperation is a second area in which the Forum is working to make a cross-cutting contribution to the effectiveness and coherence of global governance. The Forum's three technology- related Centres on Cybersecurity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network endeavour to maximize the opportunities and mitigate the risks for societies posed by technological progress. In particular, the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network is helping to fill a long- standing gap in the international institutional architecture in the area of technology governance and cooperation by creating a new international mechanism for policy development, dialogue and coordination through the following set of activities: - Policy development . Multistakeholder development of a growing suite of policies/protocols that address critical governance gaps (major social risks and opportunities) related to each major advanced technology - Piloting and implementation . Support for governments interested in piloting such policies/protocols at the national, subnational or regional levels- International experience exchange and policy dialogue . Cross-fertilization of national, subnational and self-regulatory policy experience through Global Fourth Industrial Revolution Councils aimed at sharing learnings from pilots, identifying best policy practices and framing opportunities to advance international policy consistency or interoperability - Thought leadership and knowledge diffusion . Dissemination of information and analysis on the latest Fourth Industrial Revolution policies and pilots around the world, the foremost thinking on key cross-cutting and future-oriented aspects of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (e.g. human-centred and agile governance), and the framing of Fourth Industrial Revolution implications/opportunities for other international governance domains (humanitarian, development, human rights, etc.) - Network development and support (national Fourth Industrial Revolution capacity building) . Encouragement of local ownership and translation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution concept to national circumstances through the creation of a semi-distributed network of affiliated institutions To provide a roadmap for this work, earlier this year the book Shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution was published as a practical companion and guide to Klaus Schwab's 2016 volume, The Fourth Industrial Revolution . Drawing on contributions from 200 of the world's leading experts, the book explores 12 key emerging fields - from machine learning to geoengineering to nanotechnology to data ethics - and offers a practical framework for leveraging these advances to leave the world better, safer and more resilient than we found it. A third area, the Forum's informal dialogue process among heads of international organizations, the Global Issues Group, is a forum for system-wide discussion about the priorities of these leaders for increasing the synergy and collective impact of global cooperation. A special effort is being planned to deepen this process by consulting more closely with individual international organizations to help them identify practical opportunities to leverage the Forum's platform - its multistakeholder networks and knowledge, convening and communications capacities - to advance their individual objectives; and by discussing among the group how initiatives and resources in one thematic domain of international cooperation could be better connected to and leveraged by those of others. There are precious few opportunities, let alone structured processes, to support such truly horizontal, long-term thinking. Thus, the Forum is a new kind of international organization: multistakeholder, multidisciplinary and leader-level. It works at the intersection of stakeholders, industries and regions to strengthen the strategic focus, systemic coherence and delivery capacity of international cooperation. It helps to strengthen the performance of the international system by systematically connecting the capabilities of business, civil society and academia, as well as governments at both the national and subnational levels in concrete ways that improve the state of the world. 10 Annual Report 2017-2018Shaping Future Agendas11 Annual Report 2017-201812 Annual Report 2017-2018The Forum as Convenor By W. Lee Howell Managing Director, Head of Global Programming13 Annual Report 2017-2018Convening diverse communities in a trusted, collaborative environment is essential for building platforms that integrate relevant decision-makers in systems leadership. The World Economic Forum's unique capability in multistakeholder engagement was evidenced by over 300 working group and task force meetings that took place at its offices in Geneva, New York, San Francisco, Beijing and Tokyo last year. Such working events are instrumental to achieving the objectives of the Forum's Centres and to developing the agendas for the major events highlighted in this report. The Forum's core events act as curated platforms that shape global, industry and regional agendas by convening the most relevant stakeholders. Each agenda is developed by integrating insights and initiatives from the appropriate Forum communities, System Initiatives and Centres. The strategic objective is to develop an integrated programme flow (by linking issues, insights and innovations) in a systematic, structured and stimulating manner across key Forum events, such as the Annual Meeting, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, the Annual Meeting of the Global Future Councils, the Sustainable Development Impact Summit, the Industry Strategy Meeting, as well as regional meetings. To cite one example, the inaugural Sustainable Development Impact Summit was launched in September during the United Nations General Assembly in New York with 700 leaders from over 70 countries, including nine heads of state and government. The Summit focused on accelerating progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement on climate change commitments through deeper public-private cooperation and wider application of the transformative technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Further efforts to catalyse coalitions, partnerships and alliances and to harness advanced technologies to address development, environmental and other societal challenges were undertaken two months later in Dubai on the occasion of the Annual Meeting of the Global Future Councils. Thirty-five Global Future Councils comprising 700 experts from academia, government, business and civil society convened to advance systemic change in such critical areas such as health, energy and infrastructure using innovative digital tools, including the World Economic Forum's Transformation Maps. These Transformation Maps were made available to the public and currently more than 60,000 people around the world access them online. The two events in the last quarter of 2017 were instrumental in the design and development of the overall agenda and specific sessions of the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2018 in January in Davos-Klosters. Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World was the overarching theme of the 48th Annual Meeting at which 3,000 leaders engaged in over 400 sessions focusing on four main topics: Driving sustained economic progress, Navigating a multipolar and multiconceptual world, Overcoming divisions in society, and Shaping the agile governance of technology. Six months after the Annual Meeting, the Industry Strategy Meeting was held in San Francisco at the World Economic Forum Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.The gathering brought together 350 Industry Strategy Officers to reflect further on key priorities shaping the global, regional and industry agendas, to advance the work of relevant System Initiatives and to learn about the new Centre for Cybersecurity and Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. The Forum's role as convenor takes into account the fact that the world has become much more complex, multipolar and multiconceptual. To overcome the growing uncertainty in the world, and to refrain from merely reacting to developments as they unfold, various Forum events enable leaders from all walks of life to be much more thoughtfully and actively engaged in shaping the future. Annual Report 2017-2018 14Centre for Global Industries By Jeremy Jurgens Managing Director, Head of Industry Agendas and Knowledge Engagement The Centre for Global Industries is a unique platform for industries to shape their agenda and advance sector-related public-private cooperation. The Centre, with teams mainly based in Geneva, New York and Beijing, comprises all industry- related activities, including industry- focused System Initiatives and community curation (i.e. Steward and Governor communities). During this past year, excellent progress was made on strengthening communities, which cover over 20 industries and impact industry-related issues through various initiatives and collaborative projects.15 Annual Report 2017-2018the essential characteristics digital- era enterprises must embrace to ensure they thrive. It illuminated how creating agile operating models - people, processes, technology and governance - is critical to support new patterns of consumption on the demand side, while also enabling automation and efficiencies on the supply side. In this context, as technology- led innovation rages ahead, significant workforce disruption is an inevitable outcome that was brought to the forefront. To mitigate economic inequality, representatives of the consumer industries, which employ 19% of the workforce across OECD countries, will form a task force and explore labour-force transformation solutions required to enable the reskilling and upskilling of employees. - The Future of Consumption in Fast-Growth Consumer Markets, a multi-year initiative, sought to illuminate scenarios on the future of consumption in such emerging markets as China, India and ASEAN, which comprise over 40% of the world population. In its first year (2017), this study portrayed a compelling vision of the evolution of consumption in the world's second largest consumer market - China. According to extensive proprietary research conducted across 20 cities with leading experts across the private and Consumer spending supports approximately 60% of global GDP; hence, emerging business models of the consumption landscape, enabled by disruptive technologies, are a source of new global economic growth. These models, however, can also contribute to societal challenges, including trust and transparency concerns related to consumer data, environmental degradation, digital divides and workforce volatility. In this context of seismic change, the System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Consumption aims to shape the impact of technological disruption to drive enhanced and inclusive models of consumption with sustainable benefits for business and society. It envisions a future where technology is firmly embedded in people's lives, making consumption simpler, more accessible, highly personal and more enjoyable, while also imbued with trust and in harmony with nature. Major achievements this year include the completion of two flagship projects, which fostered awareness and deep understanding of the key issues and opportunities facing the consumption landscape. They also created the necessary momentum to establish a community of purpose to address the societal implications of technological disruption. - Operating Models for the Future of Consumption provided insight into The Fourth Industrial Revolution is transforming entire systems of production, distribution and consumption, providing opportunities for new value creation through game-changing technologies.Shaping the Future of Consumption public sectors, China is predicted to transition to a consumption- driven growth model, with the purchase of goods and services by the public expected to grow 6% annually over the next decade, fuelled by income growth. This body of work also triggered an exploration into how the Forum can leverage its multistakeholder engagement to advance the consumption landscape via the evolution of data policy principles. In parallel, research began in another of the world's fastest growing markets - India. The body of work will include collaboration with NITI Aayog (the National Institution for Transforming India), the Government of India's policy think tank, as well as the Confederation of Indian Industry, the leading business association in the country.Annual Report 2017-201816 - Drove uptake of the cyber- resilience Principles and Tools for Boards through the Forum Member community and beyond. Focused on tackling cybercrime, the tools were endorsed at the International Business Council and the Community of Chairmen and have become a foundational tool (along with the Playbook for Public-Private Collaboration ) for the Forum's Centre for Cybersecurity. - C onducted original research to develop innovative ways to measure value in the digital economy. At the macro level, the Value-at-Stake framework was launched, aiming to capture the economic and societal value of digital transformation. At the micro level, pioneering research on maximizing the return on digital investments - published in a white paper by the same name - analysed investments by 16,000 companies in 14 industries to provide a data-driven perspective on where technologies are adding value. - Raised awareness of the importance and challenges of digital identity. At the Annual Meeting 2018 in Davos-Klosters, 17 organizations publicly committed to working together to ensure the empowerment of individuals and access to critical services through digital Significant progress was made this year through Forum-led, joint venture and community-led platform projects. Under the guidance of its Stewardship Board and Global Future Council, a shared narrative and an initial set of six Shared Digital Outcomes were defined - considered as the SDGs for digital - to align activity and enhance collaboration among existing initiatives. Notable progress included: - Delivered public-private platforms with a common methodology to drive internet accessibility, in partnership with five governments in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. These platforms have catalysed a range of projects, such as the Digital Ambassadors initiative in Rwanda - to train 5 million youth in digital skills - or the Girls Power Tech in Jordan, linking Jordanian girls to successful female mentors. This led to a joint partnership with Smart Africa to constitute the operational entity to implement the approach in all its member states. - Launched a cyber-resilience Playbook for Public-Private Collaboration . This publication includes practical steps on how business and governments can collaboratively tackle 14 difficult cyber-policy questions, such as how to deal with encryption. Shaping the Future of Digital Economy and Society technologies while protecting their human rights: UNHCR, the World Bank, the World Food Programme, Consumers International, Omidyar Network, the Linux Foundation, the FIDO Alliance, the GSMA, Hyperledger, ID2020, the Open Identity Exchange, the Sovrin Foundation, the World Identity Network, Accenture, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Mastercard, Microsoft, Sedicii and Visa. - Scaled research, methods and tools developed within this System Initiative by partnering on digital initiatives across the broader Forum network. Examples include Digital ASEAN, a regional platform for public-private collaboration on the digital agenda; a CEO-led Electricity industry initiative to leverage and iterate the Principles and Tools for Boards to enhance cyber-resilience; support for a network of young European entrepreneurs to connect with corporates and government to develop a guide on start-up and enterprise collaboration; and support for the humanitarian community launch of a major digital transformation initiative leveraging insights from 14 industry in-depth examinations. In addition, and as a critical enabler of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) industries are Shaping the Future of Digital Economy and Society is a multistakeholder platform to ensure an inclusive, trustworthy and sustainable digital future.17 Annual Report 2017-2018 The first phase of this initiative is focused on creating an enabling policy landscape for the greater recyclability and reuse of electronics in China. - The IoT Guidelines for Sustainability, based on the analysis of over 640 IoT deployments worldwide, provide recommendations related to cooperation, investment, business models and impact measurement to encourage the prioritization of sustainability goals within IoT commercial strategies.at the heart of the ongoing global transformations. Rapid advances in computing and connectivity technologies are creating both immense opportunities for human development and extraordinary challenges for both the private and public sectors. The work of the Forum's ICT communities ensures that governments and businesses collaborate and form partnerships to help realize the potential of technologies for society. The international community of ICT leaders focused on the human and environmental impacts of existing and emerging technologies. Together they spearheaded multiple initiatives to drive positive impact, including: - TheSkillSET.org, an initiative designed to help individuals understand and prepare for the changing employment landscape in the increasingly digital economy. The online skills portal was launched at the Annual Meeting 2018, making corporate learning modules available to anyone online for free. The initiative aims to reach 1 million people with resources and training opportunities by 2021. - Circular Electronics in China, a multistakeholder initiative to rethink the electronics supply chain to proactively mitigate the rise of e-waste, the world's fastest growing waste stream. Annual Report 2017-201818 Highlights include: - The Energy Transition Index provides data on today's performance and transition readiness of more than 100 countries, and a holistic framework to support effective energy transition. - Concerning the future of electricity, the Forum enabled the acceleration of grid edge technology and policy deployment as witnessed by the work conducted in Colombia, led by the Minister of Energy and Mines, which has leveraged the framework developed by the Forum and its partners. A new agenda to maximize opportunities from electric mobility and advanced electricity solutions in cities in an integrated way was developed and will be deployed in partnership with interested cities. - The collaboration with Mission Innovation, an alliance of leading governments committed to accelerating clean energy R&D and innovation, has created significant opportunities for public- private partnerships to increase investments in energy innovation and bring new solutions to markets. - The Global Battery Alliance is supported by a significant number The global energy system is in a state of flux. Rapid developments in areas such as the digitalization of energy, energy efficiency, renewables, energy storage and electric mobility are transforming the energy landscape and corporate strategies while helping to reduce the environmental footprint of energy. Still, greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption and production represent two-thirds of the global total and are growing alongside global energy demand. While awareness has increased and new market opportunities have been created, the energy transition is happening at a pace that is too slow to deliver on the Paris COP21 targets for secure energy. For the transition to progress, the world requires a collaborative, systematic approach that involves policy-makers and multiple industry sectors committed to solving problems and capitalizing on new opportunities. The System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Energy aims to accelerate the development of effective policies, private-sector actions and public- private collaboration to enable an effective energy transition. It serves as a platform to move to action. Over the course of the last 12 months, the Forum brought new data and frameworks to the table and formed action-oriented partnerships.Energy is at the heart of modern economic prosperity. Without it, daily activities and dreams of a cleaner, greener, more efficient world - which includes self- driving cars, the IoT, the data centres and AI needed to run them - would grind to a halt .Shaping the Future of Energy of companies and institutions and has become a truly global public- private partnership for an inclusive, sustainable and innovative battery value chain. - The Forum platform has also supported other alliances in areas such as developing blockchain solutions for energy, expanding energy access and advancing developments in hydrogen for this fuel to become part of the global mix of energy solutions. 19 Annual Report 2017-2018- Identifying and acting upon opportunities to increase the availability of quality, affordable financial services for all around the world To date, these efforts have resulted in: - Catalysing public-private partnerships via memoranda of understanding with governments on digitizing payments across value chains, including government-to-person transfers, business-to-business payments, and consumer electronic payment adoption - Changing mindsets through thought leadership; knowledge products (e.g. white papers, reports and policy recommendations) have generated more than 100,000 unique downloads on a diverse set of topics, including disruptive innovation in financial services, improved financial inclusion metrics and innovation-driven cyber-risk in financial services, and the insights have been used to inform senior policy-makers and business leaders around the globe - Driving robust engagement across traditional financial service providers, fintechs, civil society (e.g. the Vatican, labour unions), international organizations (the Today's financial and monetary systems are contending with a wave of tech-enabled innovation. These advances mean firms are increasingly competing or partnering at different points along the financial services value chain, driving costs down overall while increasing efficiencies and access. Concurrently, the public sector seeks to balance the benefits of technological innovation with the emerging risks to consumer protection and system stability. The System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Financial and Monetary Systems seeks to understand, influence and catalyse positive transformation by generating domain knowledge and strategic insights, proposing leading practices and policy recommendations, and working with governments to increase the access and use of quality, affordable financial services for unserved and underserved populations. Key areas of focus include: - Exploring why and how innovations are changing business models and restructuring ecosystems across specific aspects of the financial and monetary architecture - Analysing and assessing the implications of these changes on the efficient allocation of capital and financial stability Shaping the Future of Financial and Monetary Systems United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank), telecommunications and technology companies, and professional services institutions - Creating public-private consortia to reduce cyber-risk in the financial services system and promote the fight against financial crime - Defining high-level, global principles on the appropriate use of customer data for providers of financial services These areas of focus stem from engagement with the leadership of the System Initiative, with input from the Financial Institutions industry, and the World Economic Forum Global Future Council on Financial and Monetary Systems. A well-functioning global financial system serves as the cornerstone of economic activity, long-term growth and development.Annual Report 2017-201820 - Changing leadership mindsets by working with key industry Partners, the World Bank and the World Travel and Tourism Council. The work involved creating a network of health, travel, tourism and hospitality operators that committed to improving communications and minimizing risks, promoting travel advisories and managing border measures related to infectious disease outbreaks. - Developing the roadmap for advancing the precision medicine agenda. This effort included fostering stakeholder cooperation in four countries to build technology for accessing genomic data across country borders, developing a policy playbook for cross-border data access, and formulating ethical principles for the access and use of genomic data. Examples of success in 2017-2018 include: - Catalysing action by setting up a coalition with 70 healthcare stakeholders, including the Government of Canada, in a value- based healthcare transformation project to reduce the negative impact for patients of type 2 diabetes in Ontario, Canada.

In May in Sofia, the Forum convened public figures and business leaders from the Balkans and the European Union for a strategic discussion on helping advance welfare and economic development in the Balkan region through public- private cooperation. Similarly, work continues with global humanitarian actors to support the transformation of the international humanitarian system. In a similar way that global political superpowers have shaped global affairs, the world will witness over the coming decade the emergence of technology superpowers, which will shape the future of business, society and possibly even human nature. In anticipation of this trend, the Forum works closely with governments to harness the transformative power of the Fourth Industrial Revolution for the benefit of society. For this purpose, in early 2017 the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco was created, now being supplemented by a global network of Centres that have increased the number of government and international organization partnerships five-fold over the past year. Among others, Centres are being launched in China, India and Japan. One of the notable focuses of the government- facing work on the Fourth Industrial Revolution has been in the area of agile governance, where the Forum is working with representatives of the public and private sectors to reimagine how policy-making can be effective against a backdrop of far-reaching and rapidly evolving technological change. In March 2018, the World Economic Forum strengthened its efforts to provide insights related to geopolitics The Centre for Regional and Geopolitical Affairs maintains the World Economic Forum's long- standing commitment to delivering regional and country-level impact, and helps stakeholders decipher and navigate the transformations in the international system. We have moved into a global era that is radically plural. The world is not just multipolar but multiconceptual. Important global institutions are under growing strain, and the world's fissures and fractures increasingly affect norms and values as much as the distribution of conventional geopolitical power. But this is also a period of vibrant experimentation, with leaders around the globe exploring diverse political and economic reform agendas. More than ever, therefore, platforms allowing dialogue and collaboration among stakeholders within and between countries are needed. Facilitating this kind of engagement remains at the core of the World Economic Forum's mission, with regional meetings and initiatives an indispensable locus for insight and action. As national and global institutions come under mounting pressure, regions have become an increasingly important tier of international collaboration. This was reflected in the rich regional agendas that the Forum steered over the past year. The Forum also continued to make its platform available for dialogue to bolster peace, reconciliation and reconstruction. For example, at the Annual Meeting 2018, a new series of diplomacy dialogues around the world's key fault lines was inaugurated, such as on the Korean Peninsula, Venezuela and the Sahel, as well as exchanges within the and geo-economics. This focus is anchored in the long-standing work of The Global Risks Report , which will include new insights on the intersection of geopolitics on one side, and the environment, the Fourth Industrial Revolution and trade on the other. This track constitutes a key element in the efforts to help stakeholders decipher and navigate tumultuous changes in the international system.Annual Report 2017-201828 change, India's cultural renaissance, infrastructure, gender parity, tourism, education, skills and economic reforms.

Indian Prime Minister Modi set out his vision for a new \"Indo-Pacific\" as his country strengthens its role on the subcontinent. Despite this positive story from an economic standpoint, South Asia remains the least integrated and one of the poorest regions in the world. It is home to over 300 million poor, which is one-third of the global poverty headcount. India, the world's largest democracy, continues to be the fastest-growing major economy globally and is expanding its leadership in a wide range of global initiatives. The Forum's India and South Asia community comprises over 80 companies, 91 Young Global Leaders, 443 Global Shapers spread across 34 Hubs, and 49 entrepreneurs from the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship.

The changing geo- economic dynamics of the Korean Peninsula are of particular importance, but so, too, is the unfolding impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In this regard, the Forum announced plans to establish an Affiliate Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in collaboration with the Government of Korea, to take shape in the year ahead. In ASEAN, two communities of interest and action - the ASEAN Regional Strategy Group and the ASEAN Regional Business Council - are driving a powerful set of projects focused on key regional priorities. Among them are work on assessing how the Fourth Industrial Revolution creates opportunities for new forms of regional integration, what the future of production looks like, and how governments can respond to the future of jobs. The most recent initiative launched was Digital ASEAN, a set of projects directed at building a regional digital economy and single digital market.The Asia-Pacific region is one of the fastest growing areas, driven by a broad-based global economic recovery and strong domestic dynamics. Against this backdrop, the Forum continued to deepen its relationships with governments and strengthen its portfolio of regional projects and initiatives. This work was characterized by several high-level goals, including collaborating with many partner governments to reinforce the underlying drivers of the growth story. Just as importantly, the Forum is working to improve the quality of growth to match the impressive quantity of growth. It is helping to shape policies to drive economic inclusion, to improve environmental performance and to position countries to stay competitive in an era of rapid, non-linear change. Navigating the disruptions of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is a critical part of the initiatives. So, too, is building an understanding of how the region's rising economic weight will reshape geopolitical relationships, economic interactions, and global institutions and governance. In Australasia, the Forum invested in expanding its team with promising results. In Australia, for example, a strong multistakeholder community is taking shape, with a particular focus on shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution in a positive, human- centred direction.Asia-Pacific The Forum is collaborating with partners in the Asia-Pacific region to shape the Fourth Industrial Revolution in a way that creates opportunities for regional integration, inclusion and sustainability.Annual Report 2017-201830 economies, which led to partnerships on the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network and thematic task forces, as well as commitments to strengthen public-private cooperation even further.

Recognizing the urgent need for fresh thinking and strong leadership, the Forum consolidated The World Economic Forum engaged over 150 political, civil society and business leaders and youth from the region to provide a much-needed platform for dialogue and public- private cooperation. With the aim of developing a new narrative for a modern Europe, which also reflects the voice of those who feel disengaged from the discourse on the region's future, the group developed practical recommendations for five focus areas (including a common defence strategy, migration strategy and inclusive growth models). These were published in the Renew Europe report in January 2018. The Forum worked on implementing select objectives, such as the Universal Right to Learn - an innovative approach to lifelong learning and the acquisition of digital skills. Another goal was to partner with the European Union to benefit from the Fourth Industrial Revolution with the Digital Europe project, which seeks to create a pan- European ecosystem for innovation and entrepreneurship in which entrepreneurs thrive and easily scale their operations across borders. A group of European ecosystem builders addressed the nine opportunity areas in the \"Declaration on a Pan- European Ecosystem for Innovation and Entrepreneurship\" that was pre- launched at the Annual Meeting 2018, together with Collaboration between Start-ups and Corporates: A Practical Guide for Mutual Understanding .

The Forum expanded its collaboration with other ministries and institutes, such as the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (for the engagement of state-owned enterprises) and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (to explore areas of joint research), and deepened its association with the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development (on sustainability issues). In November 2017, the Forum hosted its annual China Business Roundtable under the theme of Accelerating Innovation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution . Hosted in Shenzhen - the fusion hub of China At the same time, the country is looking to new economy industries as the major drivers of growth. The Forum is thus establishing the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution China to leverage its experience and capabilities in international public- private cooperation to engage China further.As China consolidates its position as an economic and technological leader, the Forum is deepening its role as a platform for global dialogue. Annual Report 2017-201836 including Governor Brown of California, who took part in the Sustainable Development Impact Summit in September 2017 and Governor Inslee of Washington, who participated in the Annual Meeting 2018. A working relationship with the National Governors Association is also yielding positive results though closer cooperation and planning. Engagement with the US House of Representatives deepened: Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy led a bipartisan delegation to the Annual Meeting and another delegation visited World Economic Forum headquarters in October to learn about the Forum's expertise in the field of skills and workforce development. Collaborative work with various Forum industry teams continued to pay off, with special efforts in the health and mobility sectors worthy of note, including the US Transportation Secretary and USAID Administrator becoming Stewards of Forum initiatives. Canada Prime Minister Trudeau returned to the Annual Meeting in January 2018 and spoke of the importance of gender as a key tenet for successful economic and societal development. As Chair of the G7, his presence served to highlight a number of Canadian priorities related to the G7 agenda, with special emphasis on the importance of New milestones were reached last year in the Forum's relationship with the public sector in the United States and Canada. This engagement was reflected in its events and in the thought leadership contributed to various industry and thematic issues. Institutionally, considerable effort was put into developing the work of the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco, by hosting a steady stream of senior political leaders during visits to learn about practical policy innovations and protocols that help shape the development and application of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies. This included cabinet members, members of the House of Representatives, governors, mayors and ambassadors, and other senior officials. As a result, several formal partnerships were signed or are in advanced stages of discussion. United States President Donald Trump participated in the Annual Meeting 2018, delivering a message stating that \"America first does not mean America alone\". His presence was complemented by the participation of eight cabinet members and five senior officials, who had extensive contacts with various constituents over the course of their five-day stay. Also during the year, contact was deepened with several governors, New milestones were reached in North America, including great progress in developing the work of the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco.North America gaining traction for Canada's Oceans Protection Plan and coordinating global action to safeguard the ocean ecosystem. Ties with the federal government expanded, with nine ministers serving as Stewards across a range of topical issues, allowing for deep engagement between the government and various Forum work streams. Mobility, blended finance and health were just a few of the areas where this collaboration generated valuable outcomes. Canada showed great interest in the Forum's work related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution, with the government as well as leading cities and provinces seeking to benefit from a closer association with the Forum on this topic. The stage is set for this groundwork to be rewarding for a diverse set of Forum constituents, given how closely the Fourth Industrial Revolution agenda and the innovation agenda of Canada are linked. 37 Annual Report 2017-2018it garnered support to transform the humanitarian sector, exploring new models to deploy capital in protracted crises, and to better understand the potential of digital technologies for humanitarian action. A working group was established in June 2018 to define shared outcomes for the humanitarian system to responsibly leverage digital solutions in humanitarian efforts. Finally, as a new track, the Forum significantly expanded its engagement with IOs on the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In particular, it focused on enhancing the understanding of the Fourth Industrial Revolution within the multilateral system, highlighting the transformative impact that technology has on IO operating environments. In addition to exploring joint projects through the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco, the Forum co-hosted a UN Leaders Programme module on \"The Fourth Industrial Revolution and Systems Leadership\". Building on its long-standing relationship with the United Nations system and with peer international organizations (IOs), the Forum intensified its engagement with the international community, particularly on mobilizing partnerships and platforms to help deliver the SDGs. This was reflected in the success of the first Sustainable Development Impact Summit organized by the Forum in New York in September 2017. Additionally, a record number of heads of IOs were welcomed to the Annual Meeting, where they made important contributions to discussions related to sustainable development, climate change, migration, ocean health and refugees, among other critical subjects. Given the depth and breadth of these interactions, the Forum organized a series of consultation meetings for the IO community to integrate its feedback in key Forum activities. It plans to continue structured collaboration with a core group of multilateral institutions throughout the year. On humanitarian issues, the Forum catalysed deeper public-private collaboration in two focus areas: the Humanitarian Investing project and the Digital Transformation of the Humanitarian System. Through a number of key events and activities, International organizations As the International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation, the Forum continues to strengthen its role as the world's foremost platform for multistakeholder engagement.38 Annual Report 2017-2018By Dominic Waughray Head of the Centre for Global Public Goods Centre for Global Public Goods 39 Annual Report 2017-2018A new cooperative architecture is required, calling for compelling, practical examples and proofs of concept of what such a future could look like and how it could urgently be developed. For these reasons, the World Economic Forum established the Centre for Global Public Goods, incorporating the Forum's System Initiatives on Shaping the Future of Environment and Natural Resource Security and on Shaping the Future of Food, as well as the Forum's work on SDG partnerships and innovative and blended development finance. The Centre draws on over 180 Forum industry Partners engaged in various dimensions of this work in addition to leading international institutions, civil society groups, academic and research institutions. The Centre is also responsible for the Forum's Sustainable Development Impact Summit, working in close cooperation with the Forum's Global Programming group. Creating a compelling, practical portfolio of solutions and suggestions for how our global public goods could be managed, the Centre focuses on three major areas: - Developing new platforms to show proof of concept for scaled public- private cooperation - Helping international organizations adopt and scale some of these new kinds of cooperative solutions - Curating strategic dialogues to help shape aspects of the wider global public goods agendaThe World Economic Forum Centre for Global Public Goods brings innovation and frontier approaches to the agenda of international institutions, in particular their processes and agreements related to implementing the 2015 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on climate change. The Centre aims to improve management of the global commons and build sustainable markets to meet the 2030 SDGs. Global public goods refer to those things that all humans need and cannot be excluded from, such as a functioning global environmental system, access to safe, nutritious food, affordable energy, public health and universal education, among others. This requires developing our global commons and markets - including sustainable production and consumption systems - to deliver accessible and long-term value for all, as enshrined by the nations of the world in the SDGs. To help achieve this aim, the 17th SDG calls for a new global partnership agenda between the public, private and civil society sectors. Our unprecedented era of higher, increasingly unequal, human consumption is putting pressure not only on industry and regional agendas, but also on the international institutions mandated to manage and deliver our global public goods. As technological capacity grows, the realization of how much better humanity could organize itself to deliver inclusive, sustainable growth becomes more evident. At this remarkable juncture in human history, it is increasingly clear that a raft of pressing - and interconnected - global public good challenges must be resolved. At the same time, we have unprecedented means with which to collaborate across public, private and civil society sectors on global solutions. Achievements from the past 12 months include: Developing new platforms for public- private cooperation - The Global Battery Alliance aims to ensure that the exponential demand for batteries grows via a socially responsible, environmentally friendly and innovative value chain. Partners and initiatives representing over 30 leading organizations including businesses along the entire value chain connect on the Alliance's global platform and drive efforts on actions and initiatives relevant to the supply of raw materials for batteries, a circular economy for batteries, and innovation along the value chain to achieve results. - The Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP) is a growing platform of over 40 organizations that is changing the nature of development finance by applying blended finance approaches to manage, transfer or mitigate risk inherent or perceived in emerging and developing economies. The Partnership is a key pillar in the over $50 billion blended finance industry, exponentially increasing the pool of development finance by catalysing private investment. In 2017, SDIP built regional hubs in Africa and ASEAN through local institutions and enabled a project to reach financial closure. - The Friends of Ocean Action (FOA) initiative was launched at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2018 to help deliver practical action on SDG 14 on the world's oceans. Co-chaired by the UN Secretary-general's Special Envoy for the Ocean and the Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, supported by the Benioff Annual Report 2017-201840 Ocean Initiative and delivered in collaboration with the World Resources Institute, this initiative assembled a multistakeholder group of 46 senior leaders and influencers engaged in the Ocean agenda. In its first six months, it mobilized a broad network of action on ocean issues, identified seven key areas of global impact requiring additional public- private cooperatio and business innovation, triggered a major global plastic action partnership, catalysed a broad public-private effort to create an open access \"digital ocean\" platform by bringing together cutting-edge technology companies with UN agencies responsible for ocean data, and accelerated the delivery of new global value-chain partnerships to help ocean countries and companies address illegal fishing worldwide. - The Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE) Co-chaired by the Chief Executive Officer of the Global Environment Facility, the Executive Director of UN Environment and the Chief Executive Officer of Royal Philips, PACE is designed to support and complement SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production. As a global convening mechanism and impact project accelerator, the PACE platform now enables over 40 global leaders from business, government and the international community to co-design and advance their projects. In 2017- 2018, PACE launched a major Secondary Materials Market initiative with the support of the Government of China and major electronics companies, supported a network of African ministers to launch the Africa Circular Economy Alliance focused on eliminating electronics waste and enabled a group of leading global companies to commit to new measures on reusing their capital equipment, advancing into additional materials areas such as textiles, bio- materials and construction. The Government of the Netherlands, together with several leading Dutch circular economy innovators, UN Environment and the Global Environment Facility is currently exploring collaboration with PACE to help secure its position with the international system. - The Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 (TFA) is a public-private platform to help consumer goods companies advance their commitments on deforestation in key soft commodity supply chains by enabling deeper collaboration with forested nations, donor governments, and civil society and expert groups. As of June 2018, the TFA platform brings together 145 organizations, a growth of 45% on the previous year. In June 2018, the TFA platform renewed its mandate for 2018-2021 with funding from the Governments of the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom. Moving into the next phase of implementation, the Tropical Forest Alliance helped its partners launch a Forest and Commodities Agenda - setting out 10 clear strategic priorities for action by the end of 2020 - and develop an increasingly decentralized network, with devolved responsibility for regional implementation through public- private action across numerous jurisdictional programmes. The TFA also launched a national platform and national zero deforestation sectoral agreement in palm oil in Colombia. Helping international organizations adopt and scale new kinds of cooperative solutions - The New Vision for Agriculture (NVA) established an important network of public-private value- chain action platforms that are being gradually incorporated into the international architecture. Achievements this year include: -The successful transition of Grow Africa from a World Economic Forum-led project to a platform hosted and funded by the African Union's NEPAD Agency -The progression of Grow Asia towards being a hosted platform that works across five ASEAN countries, with coordination linkages managed through the ASEAN secretariat -Commitment by the Government of India to launch and build a new national platform for agricultural innovation, involving an agricultural drones initiative, through initial collaboration with the Government of Maharashtra and the Forum's Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network -A New Vision for Agriculture secretariat to be launched in Colombia - a first example of a nationally owned and driven NVA platform - The 2030 Water Resources Group (WRG) Governing Council held its first meeting under the new hosting arrangement within the World Bank Water Global Practice. This cements 2030 WRG 41 Annual Report 2017-2018- originally incubated within the World Economic Forum as the unique multi-donor partnership vehicle through which the Water Global Practice will engage strategically with the private sector on water resource issues. This advancement offers a good example of how major players in international developments are beginning to incorporate multistakeholder partnerships and platforms of action into their strategic operations. Curating strategic dialogues to help shape the wider global public goods agenda - With the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and EAT Foundation, the System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Food launched multistakeholder dialogues to help the international community pursue a new collaborative approach to food- system transformation. It seeks to define a shared agenda, identify science-based targets and share ideas on the policies and incentives that can promote innovation and inclusivity. Such a public-private, global initiative is particularly pertinent to the future of food, as this is a global public goods agenda that has no equivalent to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to generate scientific consensus, and no equivalent to the UN Climate \"COP\" (Conference of the Parties) process to generate political consensus and momentum for change. - The Building on the Innovation with a Purpose report launched at the Annual Meeting 2018 looked at the potential for harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution within and across global food systems. Three new work streams were initiated: a digital scaling agenda for East Africa, improving traceability and transparency in food value chains and exploring systems that can deliver sustainable feedstock production. They seek to unlock the transformative potential of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies to address food system challenges by connecting innovators with food system leaders, catalysing opportunities for scaling technological innovations for food systems transformation and developing strategies for inclusive innovation. - Further global dialogue took place on the future of protein, given the need to deliver safe, sustainable and affordable meat and protein to a world of close to 9 billion people, over 55% urbanized. Launched at the Annual Meeting 2018, leading research organizations, companies, technology innovators and international organizations are involved in this dialogue. Ideas are emerging for new public-private arrangements to accelerate the future systems for protein delivery that the world will need. - In climate change, the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders grew to 83 global companies. The alliance released a report on Two Degrees of Transformation , highlighting the CEOs' transformational actions to tackle climate change. The Friends of Climate Action, a key informal, multistakeholder platform for coordinating the public-private climate action agenda, helped to curate over 100 organizations to shape the Global Climate Action Agenda, including the \"Stepping Up Climate Action\" campaign launched at the Annual Meeting 2018.Shaping the Future of International Trade and Investment * Turbulence in international trade and investment during the year highlighted the importance of the World Economic Forum as a platform to convene leaders and address trade risks and shocks. The Forum's trade community emphasized the need to protect yet reform an open, rules-based system to empower markets and development. The community drove dialogue, insight and outreach on the systemic factors underlying current trade tensions, including the race for technological leadership, trade balances and the interaction between trade, inequality and environmental sustainability. High- level interactions included partnering with Argentina for the first-ever business forum at a WTO Ministerial Conference. Actionable policy protocols were developed to respond to trade and investment priorities. These included a suite of digital trade options produced with the WTO as part of the Enabling E-commerce initiative. Further policy responses were outlined to incentivize inclusive global value chains through reforms to taxation, competition, services and investment facilitation, and other government and industry priorities. Opportunities for technology- enabled trade disruption were explored. The Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, a multi-organization collaboration, launched a border risk- management system in Colombia, is building a trade bond mechanism in Viet Nam and is implementing growth- oriented projects in six other emerging economies. * This System Initiative sits within the Policy and Institutional Impact group.42 Annual Report 2017-2018By Saadia Zahidi Head of the Centre for the New Economy and Society Centre for the New Economy and Society43 Annual Report 2017-2018the future of work across sectors and society. Operationalizing the Forum's platform concept, the Centre also promotes greater synergies between the most impactful initiatives of its worldwide multistakeholder community, highlighting and supporting those with the greatest potential for generating systems change through an accelerator approach. To support its work, the Centre for the New Economy and Society also seeks to gather consensus on the most relevant and impactful analytics and metrics to empower stakeholders to understand and shape the new economic and social context. It considers both innovative and traditional methods of gaining insight into the global economy and society - covering the domain of \"big data\" as well as opportunities to reinforce existing and established sources of statistics and research. At the core of the Centre's activities are the System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Education, Gender and Work and the System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Economic Progress. The System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Education, Gender and Work aims to enable people, regardless of gender, age and origin, to fulfil their potential by developing and deploying their talent, thereby contributing to more prosperous economies and societies. It does this by providing the latest insights to inform and influence the global agenda on social progress and by serving as a platform for sharing best practice, building consensus and action. In 2017-2018, the System Initiative: - Remained at the forefront of the global debates on the future of work, reskilling and gender parity, How can humanity promote inclusive economic growth and universal social progress in an age in which technological disruption is rapidly changing labour markets and the very nature of economic value creation? What is needed to ensure people are equipped to fulfil their full potential in this changing global economy? How can global leaders develop a renewed vision for shared prosperity and human progress in the new economic and social context? Creating human-centric economic growth in the Fourth Industrial Revolution requires shaping a new social contract between all stakeholders of society to deliver education that matches the needs of the future, a workforce that is better prepared for shifts in labour markets, and socio-economic structures that allow for gains, risks and opportunities to be shared equitably. The World Economic Forum Centre for the New Economy and Society aims to provide leaders with a platform to build catalytic public-private partnerships and proactively shape a future in which people are at the heart of economic growth and social progress. To do this, the Centre brings together a forward-thinking community of committed leaders, equipping them with frameworks, insights and tools to promote productivity and innovation, foster social mobility and inclusion, adapt policies to the new economic context, understand and shape markets for data, and redefine the nature of competitiveness in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It also furnishes leaders with the latest frameworks, insights and tools to understand today's and tomorrow's labour markets, close skills gaps through education, reskilling and upskilling, close gender gaps through workforce integration and future-ready practices, and prepare for contributing globally recognized insights and thought leadership in the service of changing policy and mindsets. This included consistently benchmarking national gender parity through The Global Gender Gap Report 2017 ; supporting the global community, national governments and companies in strategic workforce planning through the development of the next edition of The Future of Jobs report; and highlighting new tools and ways of thinking about reskilling and job transition opportunities in disrupted industries through a complementary set of innovative knowledge products: Towards a Reskilling Revolution , proposing a methodology for identifying viable reskilling pathways, and E ight Futures of Work: Scenarios and Their Implications, providing a guide for thinking through what various possible visions of the future of work might look like and taking anticipatory action. - Launched a major new effort to address workforce disruptions and talent gaps in the Fourth Industrial Revolution through the development of Future of Work Industry Roadmaps , building on the System Initiative's latest thought leadership to develop industry communities and outline recommendations and emerging best practice for intra- and inter-industry-level action to prepare for the future of work. - Scaled its country-level work significantly. It expanded its Gender Parity Task Force model from Chile and Argentina to Peru, Panama and France to close national gender gaps in employment, wages and leadership roles and its Closing the Skills Gap Task Force model for addressing current skills gaps and reshaping education and training Annual Report 2017-201844 and track their performance on the fundamental factors driving economic progress; the Inclusive Development Index 2018 which tracks countries' progress on growth and development, inclusion and intergenerational equity. - Launched major new initiatives to support businesses in contributing towards inclusive growth, such as the Global Battery Alliance, as well as innovative tools for measuring and benchmarking environmental, social and governance performance through the System Initiative's new GrowInclusive platform, guiding companies and public- sector leaders in shifting the global economic paradigm. - Catalysed multistakeholder action to improve economic policy- making in emerging economies by hosting inclusive growth and competitiveness workshops in Brazil, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa, Thailand and Viet Nam, engaging major national and regional stakeholders in developing action plans and policy prioritization tools for their countries and regions. - Initiated an ambitious Global Dialogue on the Future of Economic Progress that seeks to consolidate the latest cutting-edge thinking on economic frontier issues such as pricing data and intangibles in the digital economy, exploring the economic implications of platform and blockchain business models, economic leapfrogging and new forms of fiscal interventions and social protection in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Moving ahead, the Dialogue Series will span a range of frontier issues for both the new economy and society, with a view to building consensus, moving for the future from South Africa to three additional G20 economies: Argentina, Australia and India. Both models are now also supported by comprehensive implementation guides (\"playbooks\") to inform stakeholders of key priorities, tools, resources and processes for action with regard to skills and gender parity, in order to scale rapidly to additional geographies through the Forum platform. - Catalysed multistakeholder action through Closing the Skills Gap Business Commitments, mobilizing businesses to equip 8 million individuals for future jobs through skilling, reskilling and upskilling efforts (with an aim of reaching 10 million beneficiaries by 2020). Building on the lessons from this successful coalition, the System Initiative will provide a platform for further business-led efforts on gender parity in the future of work as well as LGBTI inclusion. The System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Economic Progress aims to reshape the global economic agenda to drive productivity, innovation and growth while benefitting all of society. It does this by identifying the latest insights on new solutions, promoting economic growth models that deliver inclusive and sustained economic progress, and serving as a platform for sharing best practice, building consensus and action. In 2017-2018, the System Initiative: - Contributed to shaping the global debate on the future of economic progress by providing world-leading insights through The Global Competitiveness Report 2017 , helping decision- makers to understand, monitor the debate forward and sharing knowledge widely through executive briefings, white papers and social media. 45 Annual Report 2017-201846 Annual Report 2017-2018 Strengthening Public-Private Cooperation47 Annual Report 2017-2018Annual Report 2017-201848 demonstrates how such technologies can be governed in an agile, human- centred manner. By Murat S\u00f6nmez Managing Director, Head of the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution NetworkCentre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and Its Global Network Preparations continued to create a global World Economic Forum Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network, with San Francisco operating as the core and with additional Centres in Japan, operational in July 2018, and in India and China, planned for the second half of 2018. The work progressed in close collaboration with national governments and leading companies. These new Centres will provide a powerful global network effect by channelling lessons learned from rapidly developing, ageing and emerging economies, further accelerating the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network's positive impact to citizens and society. Due to strong demand from additional governments, the Network seeks to rapidly achieve global scope and scale by establishing Affiliate Centres around the globe, allowing an existing public institution to host a local Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in strong partnership with government, business, academia and civil society. The launch of eight Affiliate Centres is envisioned. In effect, the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network will establish a new operating system for international technology governance and cooperation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution by creating an ongoing dialogue and working dynamic among government, corporate, scientific/ academic and civil society stakeholders worldwide, as well as a growing body of practical experience that The World Economic Forum Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco completed its first full year of operation, focusing on shaping the governance protocols for Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies through an agile and global co-design and piloting effort involving leading businesses, governments, international organizations, academia and civil society. At the end of June 2018, over 40 full-time experts consisting of Forum employees and Fellows from partnering governments, businesses and academic institutions in eight project areas collaborated with more than 60 global companies and start-ups and 10 governments to ensure that the benefits of emerging technologies to the citizens and society are accelerated and the negative impacts are minimized. The Government of Rwanda became the first country to adopt performance-based national drone regulation as a result of the Forum's collaborative efforts, paving the way for a wide range of socially beneficial use cases, including the secure and safe delivery of medical supplies to remote clinics. Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution thought leadership pieces were well received, including Blockchain Beyond the Hype: A Practical Framework for Business Leaders , Agile Governance: Reimagining Policy-Making in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and Artificial Intelligence Collides with Patent Law .49 Annual Report 2017-20181. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning The influence of artificial intelligence can already be seen in homes and across businesses, and is already affecting political processes. In its embodied form of robots, it will soon be driving cars, stocking warehouses and caring for the young and elderly. Rapid advances in machine learning hold the promise of solving some of the most pressing issues facing society, but they also present challenges such as inscrutable \"black box\" algorithms, unethical use of data and potential job displacement. As advances in machine learning increase the scope and scale of AI's deployment, multistakeholder collaboration is required to optimize accountability, transparency, privacy and impartiality to create trust. Project areas include decision-making tools for corporate boards, protocols for government use of AI and standards for AI targeted at children. 2. Internet of Things and Connected Devices There are more connected devices in the world today than humans. By 2020, the number of these devices is projected to exceed 20 billion, fuelled by continued technological advances and the plummeting costs of computing, storage and connectivity. As the internet of things continues to spread across all aspects of day-to-day life and even become embedded in the human body, new policy frameworks and governance protocols are needed to address questions of security, data ownership, accuracy and privacy. Project areas include prioritizing security during the IoT design process, bolstering public privacy protections, advancing transparency and openness, and mobilizing market forces for equality. 3. Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Blockchain, a relatively nascent technology that enables the decentralized and secure storage and transfer of information, has already proven itself to be a powerful tracking and transaction tool. It can minimize friction, reduce corruption, increase trust and empower users. Revolutionary use cases are being explored in almost every sector, ranging from finance to energy to shipping and media. The challenge is to unlock this potential in a way that ensures inclusion, safety, interoperability and scale. This project will work to advance the principles of good governance to support the infrastructure underlying, and the applications built on, distributed ledger technology. Project areas include digital identify and certification, supply chain integration, smart contracts, and currency and monetary systems.4. Autonomous and Urban Mobility As global urbanization grows, public- and private-sector leaders must launch new mobility solutions to address people's needs, while minimizing increasingly complex social, economic and environmental challenges. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to improve road safety, decrease pollution levels, reduce congestion and increase traffic efficiency. However, this transition involves a disruptive industry shift bound to reshape public and private transportation. Collaboration across industries and sectors is needed to jointly identify the best strategies for accelerating the adoption of autonomous mobility in a safe, clean and inclusive manner. This project provides a platform for city and business leaders to work together to understand and pilot autonomous and shared vehicle fleets - generating key insights, policy frameworks and governance protocols that can be scaled globally to transform urban mobility. Project areas include scaling insights from the City of Boston pilot project, developing citywide mobility and data management platforms, launching the New Mobility Coalition and building CityWeb, a knowledge platform for city transportation officials and leading executives.In the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network, projects cover the following areas of technological innovation:Projects Annual Report 2017-201850 medicine approach into clinical practice, exploring new approaches to regulation, pricing and reimbursement for diagnostics and treatment, and expanding patient and public engagement. 7. Digital Trade and Cross-Border Data Flows Global e-commerce generated trillions of dollars in economic activity in 2017 and is growing exponentially. The free flow of data is essential to this growth and to scaling the societal benefits of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. These benefits range from providing small businesses everywhere with access to the global marketplace to making possible remote medical diagnosis and treatment in underserved communities. However, trade policy must evolve to empower new forms of digital commerce and cross- border data flows, addressing such challenges as outdated regulations, fragmented governance and strict data localization policies. Projects areas include developing a regulatory toolkit for e-payments, new policies for enabling e-commerce and a risk- based approach to data transfers, leveraging new technology to enhance data protection, future-proofing data policies and accelerating innovation in trade technology. 5. Drones and Tomorrow's Airspace Unmanned aircraft systems, commonly known as drones, are democratizing the sky. Each day, participants in the drone ecosystem are discovering new uses for this transformative technology - from delivering packages and lifesaving medicines to photographing the world. Scaling up the use of airspace to enable millions of craft to fly safely will require smart government regulation and industry-driven standards for airspace management, physical infrastructure and privacy and data ownership policies. Project areas include new paradigms for drone regulation, drone delivery for remote populations, policies for drone-derived data, revised aircraft certification and protocols for medical delivery. 6. Precision Medicine Precision medicine offers the opportunity to harness emerging technologies to tailor disease diagnosis and treatment to a specific person or population, improving outcomes and potentially lowering costs. This project aims to support the building and testing of policy frameworks to realize the benefits of precision medicine for society, while reducing risks. Project areas include generating evidence of precision medicine's effectiveness, promoting data-sharing and related infrastructure, integrating a precision 8. Fourth Industrial Revolution for the Earth The well-being of human societies is intertwined with the environment. Natural resources fuel the growth of industries and economies, and the environment influences issues as diverse as health, natural disaster response and recovery, and food and energy security. Increasingly urgent global environmental challenges - such as climate change, the loss of biodiversity and ocean health - also need fresh solutions. This project aims to build and test governance frameworks to realize the benefits of technology for the environment and society, including understanding the environmental impact of new technologies while mitigating harm arising from their deployment. Project areas include employing blockchain technology for scaling renewable energy, exploiting environmental data for resilient communities and meeting the global demand for protein. 51 Annual Report 2017-2018Other activities of the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network Fourth Industrial Revolution policies and protocols Portfolio of Global Fourth Industrial Revolution Councils: - Global Artificial Intelligence Council - Global Autonomous Vehicle Council - Global Blockchain Council - Global Drone Council - Global Internet of Things Council - Global Precision Medicine Council These Global Councils will be formed in the second half of 2018 and will initiate their activities at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019.

While digital connectivity plays a pivotal role in enabling innovation and prosperity across the world, 53 Annual Report 2017-2018build the future cybersecurity workforce to meet human capital needs The Centre is governed by the foremost cybersecurity experts. They provide advice, guidance and validation throughout the Centre's work to shape the future of cybersecurity: - Global Cybersecurity Board: comprised of the foremost leaders of companies and government bodies, this group helps shape the agenda of the Centre itself. - Global Cybersecurity Expert Committee: comprised of top experts in cybersecurity and emerging technologies, this group oversees work towards the Centre's three goals and validates its efforts. - Global Cyber Security Rapid Reaction Task Force: comprised of a worldwide network of specialists crossing technologies and geographies, this group leads a global response to systemically important cyber incidents. The Forum will gather the foremost cybersecurity experts from the private and public sectors and civil society every year at the Annual Meeting of the Centre for Cybersecurity. increasing cyberthreats present a major roadblock in the path to progress. Cybercriminals take advantage of this borderless playing field and the lack of trust among nation states, corporations and global law enforcement to build their criminal enterprises and launch attacks against their targets with limited risk and retribution. Current efforts to contain cybercrime, while essential, remain insufficient, and the global impact of cyberthreats continues to grow. Without efficient and standardized cybersecurity designs for safer products and services, consumers and corporations depend on solutions that do not ensure the safety of our shared digital networks. Additionally, the dependence on cyberspace requires developing strong and systemic cyber hygiene, practices and culture, as well as policies and norms that support security and resilience. The global threat of cyberattacks requires a powerful global response. This response is aimed at three overarching goals: 1. Reduce the global attack surface by creating global security standards, policies and practices, and promoting and implementing security by design 2. Contain current and future cyberattacks globally by boosting cooperation and information sharing 3. Deter cybercrime by increasing the risk of participating in illegal activities through greater collaboration between public and private partners Since these goals require skilled expertise, building human capital and knowledge both in business and in government institutions is a key dimension underpinning the Centre's work. To achieve these goals and foster trust and cooperation globally, the Centre builds partnerships with public and private actors to act as a force- multiplier to develop cutting-edge knowledge and tools and implement training and education globally. To facilitate this work, the Centre has developed the following work streams to generate projects, partnerships, information sharing and tools to support action on cybersecurity and resilience: - Foster global governance: support governance at the enterprise, regional and international levels, including developing effective risk management practices, and working with partners and governments to shape effective cyber-regulations and policy - Stimulate efforts to reduce cybercrime: organize and convene efforts to restrain cybercrime organizations through enforcement and restricting access to \"easy money\" - Facilitate global cyber crisis management: increase our partners' internal readiness and build up global capacities to handle global cyber crises - Anticipate future threats and risks: project future cyber-risks and work with partners to address and respond to these risks at the global, industry and organizational levels - Develop a global cybersecurity workforce: connect partners and relevant stakeholders to actively Annual Report 2017-2018 54Our Core Functions55 Annual Report 2017-201856 Annual Report 2017-2018Our Multistakeholder Communities The World Economic Forum community of communities provides a powerful foundation for building multistakeholder engagement around complex issues.57 Annual Report 2017-2018content on the well-being of native businesses, government and citizens. Civil society has historically been a dedicated and committed problem- solver, but it, too, needs to adapt to the reality of rapidly changing and interconnected challenges posed by digital and emerging technologies. The sector must also participate in the governance of these technologies as it continues its work. The Forum thus facilitated a gathering of NGOs, trade unions, religious leaders and private-sector executives on advancing non-profit impact, practice and responsibility in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Community of Chairmen This year, the Community of Chairmen focused on the dynamic geopolitical environment that is driving boards and chairs to transform their businesses more radically and rapidly than ever before. At the same time, balancing the short- and long-term interests of the company, its stakeholders and society at large is the modern dilemma of boards and an area they continued to explore. At the Community of Chairmen Annual Retreat on 20-22 April 2018, the Community's flagship event, and at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2018, discussions on the implications of the technological revolution on business and society took place with experts from the field. They explored the technologies that will revolutionize business and society in the future - blockchain and AI, among others. With the increased risk of cyberattacks, cybersecurity is also a critical subject for boards and chairs. During their discussions over the year, the Community of Chairmen brought this important topic to the next level, and took into account the Civil Society Civil society is critical in framing and advancing public good. Its involvement in multistakeholder efforts is crucial to ensuring accountability, garnering public trust and promoting inclusive processes. The World Economic Forum's integration of civil society communities in all its activities reflects its commitment to human- centred, positive social change to strengthen the effectiveness and coherence of global governance. Non-governmental organizations, faith-based institutions, labour unions and new kinds of mission- driven organizations are valuable facilitators, advocates and innovators. Often serving vulnerable populations, they help assess the impact of accelerating technological development on accountability, fairness and other societal values. The Forum initiative, Preparing Civil Society for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, acts as a mechanism to accelerate impact, practice and responsibility among civil society and social good organizations responding to digital and emerging technologies. Throughout 2017-2018, civil society leaders continued to articulate the perspectives of citizens and communities during Forum activities. Their deep engagement and support remained essential to ensuring that the Forum's multistakeholder activities and initiatives achieve tangible and positive outcomes. In particular, civil society organizations spearheaded new initiatives, including the United for News coalition. It aims to support existing and new local independent news and information organizations, foster the economically viable creation and distribution of quality content, and increase the positive impact of this set of best practices developed by the Forum for chairs and boards to ensure cyber-resilience, as well as the outcomes of a real-time cyberattack simulation that was designed especially for them. This helped to put the theory into practice. Community of Philanthropic Organizations Launched in 2013 to recognize the influence and expertise of foundations, the Community of Philanthropic Organizations comprises prominent actors in the philanthropic arena. Community members and partner foundations bring their expertise to Forum System Initiatives, projects and strategic dialogues, interfacing with business, government, multilateral institutions, academia, youth and civil society to enhance their philanthropic impact and influence global conversations. In 2017-2018, Community members and partners affirmed their intention to convene on a regular basis for closer collaboration, in particular to accelerate progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Cultural Leaders Cultural Leaders leverage the Forum's platform to help create cultural change around the big issues of our time. Artists in all disciplines, historians, educators, indigenous leaders, sports leaders and cultural institutions collaborate with the Forum to forge new alliances across sectors, speak truth to power and create inclusive narratives that change hearts and minds. With the Forum, they co-develop debates on key cultural issues, ranging from identity politics to values in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, to breaking taboos and bias on gender, race Annual Report 2017-201858This year the Community focused on challenges linked to agility, responsibility and family at its Annual Retreat, at the San Francisco Next Generation Meeting, at the Family Business Community London Meeting, at a Harvard Kennedy School programme on Impact Investing for the Next Generation with Social Entrepreneurs from the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship and at Community events. International Business Council The Fourth Industrial Revolution was the key focus of the International Business Council over the past year, whose objective was to effect systemic change to proactively manage the transformation of business around the globe. This holistic approach required thought leadership from a range of actors, as well as resources, multistakeholder collaboration and interactions, facilitated by the exchange of best practices. As organizations' obligation to build cyber-resilience increases, Council members discussed opportunities to collaborate with key policy agencies to promote public-private cooperation, share information and exchange best practices, as well as manage crises. The members welcomed the Forum's leadership and the Centre for Cybersecurity's efforts to address cyber knowledge, create new cyber-risk governance tools for executives, and expand information sharing between the public and private sectors on cybersecurity policy issues. Balancing short- and long-term pressures remains an important dilemma facing CEOs. The Council and disability; they co-create and present world-class performances that foster community-building, as well as topical installations and exhibitions that spark awe and new ideas; and they co-produce socially-engaged projects that have a direct influence on people's lives, such as the extremely successful first international tour of the Afghan Women's Orchestra in 2016, whose impact endures. In 2017-2018, the Cultural Leaders continued their integration into the Forum's governance structures, adding their specific ways of perceiving the world and challenging conventional wisdom to governing boards across the organization. Notably this year, the American rapper will.i.am joined the Advisory Board of the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco. Family Business Community The World Economic Forum Family Business Community is a select group of leading family business owners, united in their commitment to create long-term economic and social value. It offers members a trusted space for dialogue and cooperation, helping them to understand the global forces that are driving change as they strive to enhance the competitiveness of their family company in times of internal and external disruption, and to prepare the next generation to lead in a constantly evolving global context. The Family Business Community also involves a group of particularly dynamic next generation game- changers who are committed to leading innovative activities that add value to their family businesses and to society.engaged with leaders of the investment industry and reviewed a framework and methodology to sustain long-term thinking and measure success, elaborated by a working group of International Business Council members seeking to reduce the frequency of reporting but increase transparency. For the first time, members of the International Business Council, the Community of Chairmen and the Family Business Community met for a Chairperson, CEO and Owner(s) Conversation. There is no correct way to divide responsibility between the three (the chairperson, chief executive officer and business owner), but the long-term success of a company and its benefit to society depend on the confidence these leaders have in one another, their strategic alignment and common understanding of a company's culture, marketplace and development in the broader landscape. Society and Innovation Over the past year, reflecting on the effects of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the Forum continued to help stakeholders navigate between new technologies, economic progress and social impact at the national and global levels. The Forum's ongoing intellectual leadership in this area - launched by Klaus Schwab's 2016 book, The Fourth Industrial Revolution , and extended with the 2018 publication of Shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution - is catalysing a wealth of collaboration among social, government and industry leaders on disruptive business models, novel research and new forms of technological governance. 59 Annual Report 2017-2018Technology Pioneers come from all over the world, including Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Kenya and Morocco, as well as Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the USA. Their diversity is apparent in the following additional examples: Bangladesh-based ME SOLshare, which democratizes energy by developing peer-to-peer microgrids; Kenyan-based CarePay, which is developing an inclusive platform for health financing and delivery in Africa; Brazilian-based Agrosmart, which makes agronomic models based on genetics, soil type and microclimate data; Precognize (Israel), which is developing predictive maintenance software for the process industry; and BenevolentAI (United Kingdom), which is developing and applying AI for scientific innovation. The leadership of the 2018 Technology Pioneers is gender diverse, with 25% of companies co-founded by women. Examples include Viola Llewellyn, Co-Founder and President of Ovamba Solutions, who built a $500 million life insurance investment fund before co-founding Ovamba; Diana Paredes, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Suade Labs, who had a successful career in investment banking before applying her expertise to financial regulation as a service; and Elizabeth Rossiello, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of BitPesa, who is an advocate of blockchain technology in emerging markets and financial innovation across frontier markets. At the Forum Members and Technology Pioneers CEO Workshop on 20-22 March in San Francisco, the communities and experts debated the recent dramatic changes in the global context, the management In support of these efforts, the Forum's Society and Innovation team, working with the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network, developed a range of analytical frameworks and practical approaches for leaders interested in designing, deploying or governing truly human-centred emerging technologies. In 2017, the Forum launched a series of cross-cutting, strategic dialogues and research efforts on four key topics: civil society preparedness, agile governance, technology and development, and values and ethics. By treating technology as an integral component of our social framework and as representative of a diverse set of human values, the Forum is committing to helping leaders take a systemic, nuanced and agile approach to grasping the benefits and averting the risks associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Technology Pioneers The Technology Pioneers are a global community of trailblazing companies developing new technologies and innovations. They inform and influence decision-making through the contribution of new ideas and perspectives that address long-term global concerns. They come from a wide range of sectors, including cybersecurity, entertainment, energy and environment, health, mobility and production. In June 2018, 61 new Technology Pioneers were selected to join the community. A few examples include Apeel Sciences (USA), which develops plant-derived technologies to reduce food waste; Pymetrics (USA), which matches talent to opportunity using neuroscience games and AI; and Horizon State (Australia), which enables efficient and secure vote casting.of complexities while responsibly embracing the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the application of systems leadership to ensure long- term success. Young Scientists The Young Scientists community brings together 50 of the world's rising stars in science and engineering. They are selected from all regions of the world and a wide range of disciplines, and have a track record of advancing the frontiers of knowledge in areas of high societal impact. In their work, they exhibit exceptional creativity, thought leadership and high potential. Aged under 40, these individuals demonstrate their commitment to improving the state of the world by promoting evidence-based decision- making and scientific literacy among leaders from government, business and civil society at their yearly gathering at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions. The community represents more than 19 nationalities drawn from all continents, with full gender parity. In 2018, following extensive consultations with researchers and ethicists, the Young Scientists launched a universal Code of Ethics for researchers. It serves as a tool to nurture a positive change of culture in the research world by not only guiding and shaping the behaviour of individuals but also the processes of the scientific institutions that are to facilitate this cultural shift. Supported by Nature journal and many researchers around the world, this project will continue to adapt to a constantly evolving research reality. 60 Annual Report 2017-2018By Olivier Schwab Managing Director, Head of Business Engagement Business Engagement61 Annual Report 2017-2018to develop governance principles and protocols for Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies. The Forum continues to actively attract Partners to the Centre and its global Network, which functions as a pillar for Forum engagement beyond the Annual Meeting in Davos-Klosters and other major events. With this additional pillar, the Forum is now able to offer Partners more flexible and customized engagement opportunities, tailored to their needs. In parallel, the Forum continued to develop a programme for medium-sized, high-growth companies and regional leaders: Forum Members. They convened primarily at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions in China and at regional gatherings. At these meetings and throughout the year, dedicated workshops on technology and innovation were developed to understand how these emerging leaders transform industries and the business ecosystem in their country or region. In addition, Business Engagement comprises two unique business- led communities that particularly represent the spirit of the Forum. The first is the Family Business Community, which consists of the owners and operators of some of the world's leading family-run businesses. In its fifth year of existence, the community focused on how family companies respond to the world's challenges, with particular emphasis on integrating the next generation of business owners and preparing them for leadership in a fractured world. The second is the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI). Over the past 14 years, PACI has The World Economic Forum builds deep, involved relationships with the world's most important companies and strives to maximize their engagement through the Forum's diverse communities and initiatives. Over the past year, the Forum's Partners community grew by 6%, bringing the total of highly engaged, leading companies to over 670. Regional diversity continued to be a priority, with approximately one-third of Partners headquartered in Europe, one-third in North America and one- third in other parts of the world. The Asian and particularly the Chinese Partner segment grew rapidly due to sustained engagement with the leading emerging champions. Forum Partners continued to engage through the 14 System Initiatives, the industry communities, particularly through the governors peer groups, as well as through the regional work. As part of the Vision 2020 strategy to more effectively involve the most relevant business community, the engagement model was revised, and the System Initiatives and industries were brought under the umbrella of the Forum's relevant Centre, opening up the opportunity for potential Partners to engage in a more focused manner. Henceforth, companies will be able to engage in project-specific work related to their area of interest, for example on the circular economy in the Centre for Global Public Goods. At the forefront of new partner development is the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network, launched in the Spring of 2017 in San Francisco, USA. In the year since its creation, it has attracted over 60 Centre Partners and Centre Members. Together with government partners, Centre Partners work become the leading business voice on anti-corruption. Over 90 of the world's most influential CEOs signed the PACI principles, which include championing zero tolerance of corruption across their organizations and supply chains, and which act as a stimulus to join collective action initiatives that increase public trust in business, deliver fair markets and level the playing field. 62 Annual Report 2017-2018Public Engagement By Adrian Monck Managing Director, Head of Public and Social Engagement that reach a mass audience through intelligent, volume publishing and social media operations. The Forum's digital publishing activities on the web and social media are designed to attract a global audience by providing an in-depth yet accessible flow of content offering insight into topics and challenges that occupy leaders' attention. These ideas and insights provide a rich source of stories and content for the global media, and our Members and constituents benefit from a world- class team of digital communications and public relations professionals working to amplify their messages. The results of this strategy are clear: the World Economic Forum is The World Economic Forum's public engagement ensures that the organization's activities are transparent and strengthen its legitimacy by involving the public at large in its discussions. Our digital media channels and the power of our broadcast and print media relations provide our community and the global public with an unrivalled platform for the amplification and debate of serious global issues. The public engagement strategy has two interdependent pillars: to build world-class relationships and maintain continuous contact with the most relevant broadcast and print journalists worldwide, and to build globally competitive content channels mentioned more often in broadcast and print media, and has a larger digital and social media footprint than any other international organization. This year saw numerous achievements across our public engagement operations. Within a year of its opening, the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco was established as a go-to place of expertise and media commentary on issues ranging from drones to AI to blockchain. An early focus on media outreach secured its status as a recognized platform for regulatory, ethical and economic questions on the tidal wave of change being ushered in by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 63 Annual Report 2017-2018impressive growth across both social media and website audiences, with particular success in reaching younger people in emerging economies. The Forum accrued more than 1 billion views of its Facebook videos in the year to 30 June. Video content is now being created for the LinkedIn network, where the Forum's presence is growing rapidly (topping 500,000 at the end of the financial year) as it is on Twitter and Instagram. The Forum introduced live captioning on session video streams at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2018, and the #sharedfutures campaign broke new ground in connecting global citizens to Annual Meeting participants via Instagram video question-and- answer exchanges. Over 5% of participants directly answered a question from a member of the global public. As one of the largest non- sporting media events in the world, this year's Annual Meeting was a record-breaking gathering for media coverage, with more than 217,000 media mentions globally. Webcast views of the Annual Meeting session coverage totalled over 21 million on the website alone. A concerted focus to adapt and create content specifically for local consumption resulted in growth in coverage of our regional meetings. French- and Japanese-language sites were added to the Forum's portfolio of websites and a new section - Our Impact - was introduced to highlight Forum activities. These measures combined resulted in 26% growth in traffic to the Forum's website, with 4.9 million unique users visiting the site each month. The Centre for Cybersecurity also began its work with a strong footprint in trade and business media to support reaching out to new partners in the private and public sectors. New, publicized collaborations with leading academic institutions and law enforcement agencies further strengthened the profile of the new Centre. The build-up of strong relations with cyber- and infosec- media will help to firmly place the Forum in the cybersecurity space. A media campaign to support the reorientation of the Forum presence in Japan, followed closely by the launch of the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Japan, helped the Forum to enhance its coverage in the world's third largest economy. Institutionally, the Forum's Public Engagement team nudged the international media to promote diversity by proactively supporting and requesting female voices for panels, moderation and roles at Forum events. The team also worked actively to balance gender contributions on the Forum's media channels by actively commissioning female economists, scientists and social activists as authors. The Forum advanced its role as an essential public engagement platform for its Strategic Partners community by successfully shifting from an events-driven approach to year-round engagement. With unprecedented media and social media activities around the Industry Strategy Meeting, shaping the industry agenda was extended beyond the Forum's constituents to a larger audience of business and industry leaders. This year, the Forum's digital publishing platform experienced In 2017-2018, the World Economic Forum publicly published 28 reports and 53 white papers on topics relevant to our 14 System Initiatives, 21 industry communities, and the regional transformations the Forum is working to shape. In addition, Forum communities generated hundreds of privately published papers and reports designed to shape interactions and accelerate outcomes. Through its Agenda blog platform, the Forum published nearly 4,500 articles last year, contributed by Forum constituents as well as reposted from a network of around 170 third-party content partners. In addition, the Forum's globally acknowledged indexing reports generated high public recognition. The Global Gender Gap Report 2017 was downloaded 115,000 times from the Forum's website and was mentioned some 12,000 times in the global press, bringing the Forum over $63.1 million in publicity value of the publication. The Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018 was downloaded 93,000 times and received over 16,000 mentions, earning approximately $47.6 million in publicity value. The 2017-2018 year put the Forum's public engagement activities on an unprecedented firm footing, reinforcing the Forum as the top platform to engage the public on the most significant global challenges. 64 Annual Report 2017-2018Strategic Intelligence By Jeremy Jurgens Managing Director, Head of Industry Agendas and Knowledge Engagement65 Annual Report 2017-2018of a digital knowledge engagement programme. In line with the Forum's mission to promote a global and informed discussion on global issues, a public version of the Transformation Maps was launched at the Annual Meeting of the Global Future Councils 2017 in Dubai. Interest in the public maps was significant, and over 60,000 public users signed up in the first six months. The Forum also continued to refine and equip its expert communities to ensure engagement of the highest quality with them, in the service of the Forum's overall strategic goals. Since their creation in 2008, the World Economic Forum Global Future Councils have contributed significantly to our forward-looking agenda, providing more than 370 Agenda articles and 35 podcasts exploring the intersection of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and global systems. The Forum's Expert Network, a 5,000-strong community of leading thinkers and practitioners across all the issues covered by the Transformation Maps, is increasingly using the digital platform to share research, comment on developments and engage with one another to explore issues in greater depth. In addition, the Forum's academic engagement through the Global University Leaders Forum (GULF) and other university collaborations continued to strengthen, with an engagement framework centred around these new strategic intelligence capacities.The Forum's strategic intelligence capacity expanded in scope and sophistication in 2017-2018. It has become a core pillar of the overall institutional positioning as the global platform for public-private cooperation, and it complements the Forum's events and public engagement. Transformation Maps, covering 126 topic areas and synthesizing the collective intelligence of the Forum's network, are at the heart of this capacity. They are co-curated with leading universities, think tanks and international organizations, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Oxford, Yale University, the Inter- American Development Bank and the International Organization for Migration. They also incorporate research and analysis from leading research institutions around the world, which is automatically scanned, summarized and classified based on a proprietary machine learning capacity. Currently, the system analyses more than 1,000 reports and articles a day in five languages from over 200 sources, including the Brookings Institution, Bruegel, Carnegie India, Chatham House, Harvard Business School and others. New Transformation Map features were introduced during the year, such as short explainer podcasts featuring the co-curators of the maps, and the enhanced ability to customize maps for individual organizations or projects. In addition, trends and signals derived from the large body of knowledge accumulated through the machine- curated knowledge feed can be displayed - one of the advanced features offered to Partners as part 66 Annual Report 2017-2018People and Culture By Emma Benameur Head of People and Culture At the World Economic Forum, we want to hire and engage the world's most passionate and purpose- driven individuals. Key achievements and initiatives from the past year to achieve that objective included focusing on acquiring talent for the new Centres. The Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco had 39 highly talented individuals, 25 women and 14 men, a little over a year after its launch. It grew fast with 62% of the team hired in the course of the year and 18% through internal mobility. 15% of the talent are secondees, bringing profound expertise in AI, machine learning, blockchain and digital policy from public- and private-sector partners. The Forum's Japan office comprised five employees at the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, in partnership with the Asia Pacific Initiative and Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Forum opened the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Japan in Tokyo. Centres in India and China are being established, adding further talent to the global team of staff and secondees. The Forum engaged 39 secondees from 25 organizations, of whom 15% are working with the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network, representing diverse profiles of organizations from government, consulting, industry, technology and financial services. The Forum also created a Global Leadership Institute to shape the future of learning and leadership in this era of fast-paced technological change. The Institute aims to help develop the mindset, skills and tools needed to be a leader in times of disruption and to drive systems- level change through public-private cooperation. A core pillar of the Global Leadership Institute is the Global Leadership Fellows programme. It prepares future leaders through on-the-job learning, academic training, and individual development and coaching. In 2017, 19 Fellows from 15 nationalities were admitted from among more than 2,500 candidates.67 Annual Report 2017-201857% of employees are female, with 40% of leadership positions held by women. The Forum proactively strives to improve gender representation at the leadership levels. Gender diversity is embedded in the culture of the organization. 726 staff are employed globally. Secondees are also engaged from more than 25 partner organizations to collaborate on specific projects. The Forum employs exceptional people, including secondees from partner companies and organizations. 224 new employees joined last year from the private and public sectors, as well as from NGOs, academia and the media. The Forum recruits individuals from all walks of life, who want to make a difference for our communities. 21% of employees take on greater responsibilities or new roles within the organization every year.38,000 candidates applied for positions last year. For each open position, on average 170 applications are received. People join the Forum because they want to improve the state of the world.83 nationalities from all continents are represented at the Forum, across five office locations (Geneva, New York, San Francisco, Beijing, Tokyo). Diversity is integral to the success of the Forum. 123 Global Leadership Fellows (GLF) work at the Forum, with nearly 30% of leadership positions held by fellows who graduated from the programme. Our Global Leadership Institute prepares future leaders for a complex and ambiguous world. The Forum also invests in the development of all staff through continuous learning opportunities. 9% of employees left last fiscal year. The Forum supports internal and external career development. On average, employees stay with the Forum 4.6 years.The World Economic Forum comprises diverse and exceptional individuals from all walks of life. The numbers displayed on the right highlight some key people measures at the Forum. Our employees are at the heart of the Forum's ability to serve its communities and fulfil its mission. To stay at the frontier of today's rapidly changing global environment, the Forum continues to shift towards a more adaptive and dynamic ecosystem of talent.

In the Technology arena we have continued to evolve TopLink (www.toplink.org) to become the virtual platform for the engagement of our constituents. We launched the Transformation Maps to the public, attracting some 60,000 subscribers in the first few months. Our new Engagement Viewer allows Partners to visualize all their points of engagement with the Forum. We enhanced the event registration experience, allowing for one-click registration and instant confirmation. In the mobile space, we combined the previous Knowledge App with the Events App to become the single TopLink App, providing a single point of entry for our digital services around communities, events and knowledge. Internally, we have revamped our system to provide colleagues with a state-of-the-art user interface and introduced new ways of sharing documents. We supported the creation of the new Centres on the technology side, adapted to the new regulations regarding data privacy (GDPR) and finally, are investing in and monitoring all aspects of cybersecurity in the best security interests of the Forum. The Forum's Finance, Technology and Operations team supports the Forum with responsibility for finance, controlling, procurement, general services, hospitality and technology. We deliver a cost-effective, client- focused infrastructure for all Forum locations. The Forum is conscious that our financial resources are provided in trust by our Members and Partners. We ensure financial management best practice and discipline. We develop and maintain an integrated institution-wide financial accounting system, with appropriate financial reporting and internal control. We provide leadership for the strategic planning, performance reporting, budget analysis, justification, control and reporting of all functions. This year we built on the consolidation of Forum operations into OneForum that took place in 2016-2017, focusing on providing flexible and agile systems that could support the fast growth in particular of the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network, as well as the re-establishment of our Japan office and its integration with Forum governance and operations. We continued to improve the \"quote-to-cash\" systems that automate our contract management processes and reinforced our data analytics capacities to enable more effective data-driven decision- making. Increases in direct funding contributions encouraged the development of a robust grant management process.72 Annual Report 2017-2018Social Engagement through Our Foundations By Adrian Monck Managing Director, Head of Public and Social Engagement 73 Annual Report 2017-2018inclusive communities. Shapers are diverse in expertise, education, income and race, but are united by their desire to bring about change. Shapers look for opportunities to have impact on a global scale by joining forces with other Hubs. They represent a network of peers connected through TopLink, the Forum's digital platform, and through events and joint projects. In September 2017, Klaus Schwab challenged Shapers around the world to evaluate their city's preparedness for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and to make recommendations that could improve their city's readiness for change. They consulted with local governments, institutions and representatives of civil society before submitting over 100 Hub proposals. Shapers representing the top proposals were invited to Geneva to present their ideas to Schwab and Forum experts, exhibiting the important role young people can play in shaping their city's future. At the Annual Meeting 2018, Shapers kicked-off a year-long partnership with Procter & Gamble after meeting with Carolyn Tastad, Group President for North America. Together they launched a call to action for solutions to gender inequality. Over 100 Hubs submitted their solutions with five winning Hubs sharing a $100,000 grant to bring their ideas to life. As part of the campaign, Shapers sparked a social media conversation on the need to challenge the status quo. #WeSeeEqual has reached over 1.5 million people to date.

Today, this peer network of 1,200 members and alumni organizes executive education, global meetings, group expeditions and opportunities to collaborate and test ideas. More than ever, the world needs public officials capable of restoring people's faith in a better future. Among its main priorities, the Forum of Young Global Leaders is committed to supporting its members in pursuit of public service through a series of programmes and boot camps. Over the last year, YGLs convened for a Public Leadership Masterclass in Canada joined by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, participating in an intimate discussion around public- sector leadership. YGLs travelled to Brussels to discuss policies and regulations with members of the European Commission and European Parliament. In October 2017 , the community celebrated the election of YGL Jacinda Ardern as Prime Minister of New Zealand, the youngest female head of government.75 Annual Report 2017-2018The programme offers tuition-free executive education to strengthen the leadership skills and broaden the world view of YGLs. This year, over 250 members participated in programmes at such leading institutions as Harvard, Oxford and Princeton universities and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. The YGL Foundation challenges its members to learn from each other, work with experts in the field and take individual and collective action around key issues. Last year saw a strong focus on the environment and sustainable development. From Jaime Nack's leadership on green events and workplace education to Sonia Medina's efforts to secure a low-carbon world for children, YGLs are already at the forefront of fighting for the future of the planet. YGLs travelled to Greenland to gain insight into current climate science research and made commitments to follow up on their visit. In keeping with this focus, a new education programme was launched with the Princeton University Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment to increase YGLs' resilience to environmental challenges. Finally, 100 purpose-driven leaders were selected to join the Class of 2018. From solving challenges around antibiotic resistance to building spacecraft, the class is a global powerhouse of artists, business leaders, public servants and social entrepreneurs. Over half are women and the majority of the cohort is from emerging economies. Taken together, they represent the very best of their generation and are advancing new models of sustainable social innovation.

In January, the Annual Meeting 2018 in Davos-Klosters was certified to this international standard, following audits by an external auditing company. With ISO 20121, the Forum follows a strict methodology to embed sustainability in its internal day-to-day management. As part of this sustainability programme, the Forum is taking responsibility for its direct environmental impacts. Based on a carbon footprint assessment of Annual Meeting activities, environmental measures were implemented in Davos- Klosters and are being rolled out to other Forum events and offices. This specifically includes efforts in the field of energy management, resource optimization and environmental impact reduction pertaining to transportation and catering services. In addition, through its Sustainable Procurement Policy published in 2017, the Forum aims to ensure that sustainability practices are also implemented throughout its value chain. This includes making sure goods and services are procured with an emphasis on fair employment and environmental attributes, as well as other social and ethical criteria. A Code of Conduct for Suppliers, elaborated the same year, requires suppliers to take appropriate steps to ensure that sustainability principles are respected in all locations where products and services are produced or sourced.Institutional integrity and compliance Institutional integrity underpinned by compliance with applicable laws and ethical standards is at the heart of World Economic Forum operations. The Forum is committed to upholding the highest standards of professional integrity to be able to serve as a valued, independent and impartial partner to its international stakeholder base. The Forum's Compliance and Institutional Affairs department hence offers guidance, training and support to all Forum employees in order to foster a sustainable culture of moral and intellectual integrity. Importantly, the department is integrated into the highest management level of the organization. It is chaired by a member of the Managing Board supported by the Head of Legal and Compliance, who jointly set the integrity standards for all Forum offices around the world. Among other duties, the department is responsible for enforcing the Forum's Code of Conduct, designing and implementing associated policies, and advising the organization on emerging compliance issues.

The Forum collaborates with many Swiss suppliers to deliver the Annual Meeting in Davos-Klosters and values local expertise for its operations. It also actively engages with local stakeholders and authorities to ensure mutual benefits, and supports the development of local sustainability programmes. The Open Forum event format has increased the engagement of the local community, civil society and general public on topical debates, allowing a broader audience to participate in the activities of the World Economic Forum.85 Annual Report 2017-201886 Annual Report 2017-2018Financial Statements87 Annual Report 2017-2018Annual Report 2017-201888 Basis for the establishment of the consolidated accounts The consolidated financial statements (hereafter also \"the accounts\" or \"financial statements\" or \"annual\" consolidated accounts\") of the World Economic Forum are prepared in accordance with the provisions of Swiss GAAP FER.

Risk management policy Risk assessment To satisfy internal control system requirements, the World Economic Forum operates continuous risk and control reviews through various independent institutional review and governance organs, such as the Foundation Board, Audit Committee and Statutory Audit under Swiss Law. Internally, the World Economic Forum is governed by the Managing Board under the chairmanship of Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab. Internal organs, such as the Engagement Leadership Team and the Project Review Board, assess the suitability and eligibility of Partners and Members and review project activities. Management of exchange risk exposure The Swiss franc is the functional currency of the Foundation. The World Economic Forum receives its revenue in Swiss francs and US dollars. Most expenses are in Swiss francs and a minority are in euros and US dollars. The exchange rate risk exposure is very low and generated gains and losses are posted in the profit and loss statement. Management of liquidity risk The Foundation is exposed to this risk in the event certain counterparts default or have refinancing problems. The liquidity position is proactively supervised to ensure the Foundation can cover its obligations at all times. Market risks The Foundation has low exposure to market risks thanks to the diversity of its revenues. This low risk is mainly linked to the dependence on the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos-Klosters. Annual Meeting revenues represented 14% of total revenues in 2018. The cancellation of the Annual Meeting could have negative consequences on the Foundation's revenues.Annual Report 2017-201892 58 T\u00e9l\u00e9fax: +41 58 792 91 10, www.pwc.ch PricewaterhouseCoopers SA is a member of the global PricewaterhouseCoopers network of firms, each of which is a separate and independent legal entity.

In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity's preparation of the consolidated financial state ments in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of acc ounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
