And, quite frankly, it can be uncomfortable to get started, as all new things typically are. But, what if we told you that there are many ways that you can be ushered into a mindful state that many associate with meditation? And one of the ways you can relax, turn off the noise of the outside world, and be mindful is through acupuncture. Utilizing acupuncture as a meditative tool is a holistic way to focus your mind, care for your mind and soul, and relieve life's stressors. Let's take a look at 8 ways that Acupuncture can be utilized as a form of meditation: 1. They Help Reduce Stress: Stress seems to be omnipresent in the lives of many these days. These last few years have brought about almost a universal stress level. Acupuncture and meditation can both help relax your body, reduce anxiety, and leave you feeling more in control of your life. 2. They Can Aid in Reducing Blood Pressure: Excess stress and anxiety can both put undue strain on a person's heart. By utilizing acupuncture and meditation to reduce your stress levels, you can help to reduce your blood pressure - which, in turn can help decrease your chances of suffering from a heart attack or stroke. 3. They Assist in Providing Mental Clarity: Meditation is often used to help to clear the mind from the outside noise and provide the participant with greater mental clarity. Did you know that acupuncture can help as an aid in improving your meditation practice? By calming and relaxing your body through acupuncture, this allows you to achieve a deeper state of meditation. 4. They Help Reduce Pain: According to David Linden, a professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University and author of Touch: The Science of Hand, Heart, and Mind: \"The brain can say, 'Hey that's interesting. Turn up the volume on this pain information that's coming in, or it can say, 'Oh no \u2014 let's turn down the volume on that and pay less attention to it.'\" Because your state of mind plays a role in perceiving pain, meditation can also be an effective tool to help cope with or even reduce these sensations. Pair this with the relief you can feel through acupuncture, these become successful drug-free methods to help manage pain. 5. They Aid in Preventative Care: Acupuncture releases hormones that boost your body's immune system, helping you fight off illnesses before they take effect. Additionally, meditation can help keep your mind sharp, staving off memory loss and dementia as you age. 6. They Can Help You Sleep Better: Because acupuncture and meditation produce feelings of relaxation, they can help people who have trouble sleeping at night get the rest their body needs to remain healthy and alert during the day. 7. They Can Aid With Digestive Health. Acupuncture can help regulate your digestive system, relieving cramps and gastrointestinal distress. Because it aids digestion, acupuncture may also aid in weight loss. 8. They Help Detox Efforts: Smokers looking to quit cigarettes have found meditation to be effective at reducing cravings and managing irritability. Acupuncture also promotes tissue repair, helping your body recover from the negative effects of smoking once you've quit.
