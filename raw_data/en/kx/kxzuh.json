Post -Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)++ for individuals with certain risk factors who are more likely to have been recently exposed to monkeypox even if they have not had documented exposure to someone with confirmed monkeypox. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis ( PrEP ) for individuals at occupational risk ofmonkeypox according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidance , including laboratory workers who perform monkeypox testing, and clinical and public health workers who collect monkeypox specimens. Also, consideration of PrEP for high -risk populations. 29 CDC Vaccination StrategiesJYNNEOS EUA: Intradermal Administration for >18 8/9/22 ,FDA issued authorization (EUA) allowing an alternative regimen: One-fifth (0.1mL) dose given weeks , 28days ,apart . For individuals >18 years old at high risk of MPX infection . Data reviewed included clinical study comparing subcutaneous andintradermal (one -fifth dose )administration Similar immune response in both groups. Intradermal administration resulted in 100% of recipients with redness, firmness, itchiness or swelling at the injection site, but these side effects were manageable. 30 Monkeypox Update: FDA Authorizes Emergency Use of JYNNEOS for <18 years old 8/9/22, FDA EUA also allows for use of the vaccine in individuals younger than 18 years of age determined to be at high risk of MPX infection For <18 years old, JYNNEOS is administered bysubcutaneous injection. If a pediatric high -risk contact case is identified for whom PEP JYNNEOS is being considered , please contact local health department. 31 Monkeypox Update: FDA Authorizes Emergency Use of JYNNEOS VaccineAlternative and Standard Vaccine Regimens 32 Interim Clinical Considerations for use of JYNNEOS and ACAM2000Alternative and Standard Vaccine Regimens 33 Interim Clinical Considerations for use of JYNNEOS and ACAM2000Alternative and Standard Vaccine Regimens 34 Interim Clinical Considerations for use of JYNNEOS and ACAM2000Intradermal Administration 35 Interim Clinical Considerations for use of JYNNEOS and ACAM2000 Intradermal Administration 36 Interim Clinical Considerations for use of JYNNEOS and ACAM2000Intradermal Administration 37 Interim Clinical Considerations for use of JYNNEOS and ACAM2000Intradermal Administration 38 Interim Clinical Considerations for use of JYNNEOS and ACAM2000Storage & Handling Kate McHugh, CDPH 39Bivalent Booster Storage and Handling CDPH does not have any specifics yet Bivalent Boosters should Have a new National Drug Code (NDC) Have the same storage and handling requirements as the products currently authorized With more types of vaccines in inventory, it is important to ensure you are clearly organizing and labeling items in your refrigerator Always triple -check that you are administering the correct vaccine before you administer it! 40 Vaccine Administration ChecklistNovavax Expiry CDPH heard from a few providers that their Novavax expiration dates changed after receipt. Double check and make sure you have the most up -to-date expiration dates for your Novavax using the link found here: https://us.novavaxcovidvaccine.com/hcp 41COVID -19 Provider Operations Manual (POM) 42 Receiving Novavax Shipments Product is authorized under EUA as a two -dose primary series for individuals 18 years and older. DO NOT DILUTE. Vaccine ships like other routine refrigerated vaccines at temperatures between 2 \u00b0to 8\u00b0C. Vaccine ships in a small, single -use shipper; dispose of shipper. Store unpunctured multi -dose vials in a refrigerator between 2 \u00b0to 8\u00b0C (36 \u00b0to 46 \u00b0F) until expiration. DO NOT FREEZE. Apply storage and handling labels to cartons or plastic bag holding vials to prevent administration errors. Novavax Vaccine Fact Sheet & Receiving Guidance COVID -19 Provider Operations Manual (POM) 43 Managing Expiration & Beyond -Use Dates Expiration dates may not be printed on the vial and may change as more stability data become available. All manufacturers provide online expiry checkers to assist! Manufacturer -shortened expiration dates may apply if storing unpunctured vials under conditions other than coldest recommended temperatures. Apply CDC's vaccine -specific BUD tracking labels so vaccines aren't used past these reduced limits. After Puncture: Label vial with puncture date/time so vaccine is not used after this time limit. Always discard vaccine after the earlier of the expiration or beyond -usedate.
