To understand the research trends and prospects of foot reflexology in the past 31 years, this study used the Web of Science core collection as the data source and two visualization tools, COOC and VOSviewer, to analyze the literature related to the field of foot reflexology from 1991 to 2021. This study found that the number of articles published in the field of foot reflexology has been increasing year by year, and the top three journals with the most articles are Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice, Therapies in Medicine, and the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine. The top three most prolific authors are Wyatt, Sikorskii, and Victorson, and the core institutions in the field of foot reflexology are Michigan State University, Northwestern University, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, and the University of Exeter. Foot reflexology has been shown to have a moderating effect on anxiety, fatigue, and cancer, and is a topic of ongoing and future research. This study uses this bibliometric analysis of foot reflexology literature to provide an overview of prior knowledge and a reference direction for modern preventive medicine.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-12-20", "cleaned_text": "Foot Reflexology: Recent Research Trends and Prospects [https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11010009](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11010009) [Preventive /journal/healthcare/special_issues/9V5YUVZ9X8 )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-healthcare-11-00009)]. Reflexology is also known as regional therapy and reflex massage therapy. Its principle is that each area of the hands and feet represents each part of the body, such as the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, and other internal organs, and when various areas of the hands and feet are massaged, it can stimulate energy, blood, nutrition, or nerves, resulting in therapeutic effects, including relieving mental stress, detoxifying the body, promoting blood circulation, losing weight, delaying aging, and improving internal health [ [2](#B2-healthcare-11-00009)], as shown in [Figure 1](#healthcare-11-00009-f001). - It does not use any drugs or chemicals and is the best choice for many health problems; - It can reduce pain; - It helps maintain physical flexibility and athleticism; - It relaxes the limbs, especially the hands and feet, and the whole body; - It stimulates the body to release pain-relieving chemicals; - It can be used as a means of preventing disease; - It triggers the release of endorphins and enkephalins, which help relieve pain and improve mental energy and well-being [ [5](#B5-healthcare-11-00009)]. [6](#B6-healthcare-11-00009), [7](#B7-healthcare-11-00009)]. Reflexology is one of the most commonly used modalities of CAM in Europe [ [8](#B8-healthcare-11-00009)]. The most common reason for using CAM is dissatisfaction with the outcome of traditional medical care (CAM is most commonly used for musculoskeletal problems). A survey of reflexology use in the United Kingdom found an average one-year prevalence of 41.1% and an average lifetime use of 51.8% [ [9](#B9-healthcare-11-00009)]. Usage rates for older adults in the United States range from 23% to 62.9% [ [10](#B10-healthcare-11-00009)]. In Taiwan, the one-year usage rate is 85.65% [ [11](#B11-healthcare-11-00009)]. In many countries, CAM is associated with the cosmetic industry and unorthodox medicine, and CAM is actively used in hospices, nursing homes, and obstetrics in healthcare settings. A study of clinicians showed that, on average, physicians consider CAM to be moderately effective, and 23.3% of them consider it to be an effective method of treatment [ [12](#B12-healthcare-11-00009)] and would recommend it to their patients. The most common reasons for recommendation are to relax musculoskeletal pain, chronic disease, and nerve pain [ [13](#B13-healthcare-11-00009), [14](#B14-healthcare-11-00009), [15](#B15-healthcare-11-00009)]. There is a worldwide shift in the attitude towards CAM due to its use as secondary care and integration into mainstream medical care [ [16](#B16-healthcare-11-00009)]. In general, complementary and alternative medicine is increasingly recognized as a safe and effective way to reduce pain and illness [ [16](#B16-healthcare-11-00009)]. It is also a non-invasive and inexpensive form of health care that can be used by most people (including children, the elderly, cancer patients, and pregnant women) [ [17](#B17-healthcare-11-00009)]. Foot reflexology is one of the methods used by complementary and alternative medicine in medical treatment [ [1](#B1-healthcare-11-00009), [18](#B18-healthcare-11-00009)], and it differs from general foot massage as it targets the reflex zones of the feet corresponding to the body part in a deeper manner. Foot reflexology has been trained and certified by professional foot reflexologists as researchers [ [19](#B19-healthcare-11-00009), [20](#B20-healthcare-11-00009)], and it is commonly used in medical institutions as adjunctive therapy in an attempt to relieve pain or improve sleep when nurses are caring for patients. [4](#B4-healthcare-11-00009)]. It is considered to be the most commonly used CAM for older people [ [21](#B21-healthcare-11-00009)]. However, studies have also shown that younger people are more likely to use CAM than older people [ [22](#B22-healthcare-11-00009)]. The founder of the Rwo Shur method (also known as Father Josef's method), Father Josef Eugster Johann, suffered from osteoarthritis. After reading Gesund in die Zukunft (The Future of Health) by Schwester Hedi Masafret, he invented a new therapeutic method of foot reflexology to treat his osteoarthritis and suggested that \"this home remedy could save medical expenses.\" He founded the Fr. Josef Eugster Holistic Human Development (H.D.) Association and trained many foot reflexologists who have since helped scores of patients with stroke, insomnia, stomach pain, and neurological and skeletal disorders. Furthermore, the H.D. Association continues to explore reflexology clues in various parts of the body and develop new techniques that are useful in restoring health [ [23](#B23-healthcare-11-00009)]. The World Health Organization (WHO) stated in 1990 that the combination of traditional drug-free podiatric medicine with modern surgical medicine can improve individuals' understanding of their health while increasing medical coverage [ [24](#B24-healthcare-11-00009)]. Thus, it is clear that foot reflexology is gradually being used as a non-invasive complementary therapy in medicine, nursing, and CAM practitioners to promote health restoration and the revitalization of various body parts at all ages as it has been proposed to enhance blood flow, relax the body, and improve injury healing [ [25](#B25-healthcare-11-00009)]. [26](#B26-healthcare-11-00009)], cesarean pain [ [27](#B27-healthcare-11-00009)], acute pain in infants [ [28](#B28-healthcare-11-00009), [29](#B29-healthcare-11-00009)], pregnancy pain postpartum women's fatigue [ [38](#B38-healthcare-11-00009)], pain from surgical medical examinations [ [39](#B39-healthcare-11-00009), [40](#B40-healthcare-11-00009)], organ removal or transplant pain [ [41](#B41-healthcare-11-00009), [42](#B42-healthcare-11-00009), [47](#B47-healthcare-11-00009), [48](#B48-healthcare-11-00009), [49](#B49-healthcare-11-00009)]. It can also be used as a treatment for individual musculoskeletal cases [ [50](#B50-healthcare-11-00009)]. In addition, foot reflexology is also an effective treatment for strokes, insomnia, asthma, diabetes, premenstrual syndrome, dementia, cancers, multiple sclerosis, and idiopathic detrusor overactivity [ [51](#B51-healthcare-11-00009), [52](#B52-healthcare-11-00009), [53](#B53-healthcare-11-00009)]. It has also been studied for use in hospice units to alleviate discomfort and pain in patients at the end of life [ [54](#B54-healthcare-11-00009)]. In fact, there are many studies exploring reflexology on the quality of life with cancer. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Sources [55](#B55-healthcare-11-00009)]. 2.2. Analytical Methods [50](#B50-healthcare-11-00009)]. The data were analyzed from the perspectives of the annual number of publications, journals, prolific authors, research institutions, authors and collaboration networks of research institutions, keywords, highly cited papers, and research fields, in order to provide an important reference for subsequent research and practitioners of foot reflexology [ [56](#B56-healthcare-11-00009)]. 3. Results [55](#B55-healthcare-11-00009)]. There were 414 publications in the field of foot reflexology, of which 94% were in English and 6% were in another language, including 1063 institutions in 62 countries, covering 75 research directions and 102 research areas [ [57](#B57-healthcare-11-00009)]. 3.1. Annual Number of Publications [Figure 2](#healthcare-11-00009-f002)) as well as journals accepting CAM reflexology articles for publication and an increasing number of researchers interested in CAM and reflexology. 3.2. Journals [Table 1](#healthcare-11-00009-t001). [Figure 3](#healthcare-11-00009-f003)shows the geographical distribution of the main countries worldwide and the knowledge domains of the co-authorization. This research found 62 countries around the world participating in the study of reflexology. The nodes represent different countries, while the sizes of the nodes represent the domain activity and scientific output of the country. The various colors represent different clusters of the co-location matrix based on the corresponding countries. The connection between the two nodes indicates their knowledge collaboration. The thickness of the lines indicates the degree of collaboration. Obviously, the stronger the connection between two nodes, the deeper the contact and cooperation between the two countries. From the figure, 12 clusters could be seen. [Figure 4](#healthcare-11-00009-f004)shows the top 15 countries with the most published papers, among which the top three countries were the United States, Iran, and Turkey, and [Table 2](#healthcare-11-00009-t002)presents the related research in each country, which mostly focuses on the application analysis of foot reflexology. As can be seen from the following graphs, a great deal of effort and cooperation in the progress of foot reflexology research has been conducted in every country in the world. This indicates that the future trend in this field is for many countries and regions to value and expect more diversified cooperation and development. 3.3. Prolific Authors [Figure 5](#healthcare-11-00009-f005), with the top three authors being Wyatt, Sikorskii, and Victorson. Wyatt, Sikorskii, and Victorson have published 13 papers together, and Wyatt and Sikorskii have published 26 papers together. Wyatt began his research on reflexology for cancer and family caregivers in 2006 [ [46](#B46-healthcare-11-00009), [49](#B49-healthcare-11-00009)]. He collaborated with Sikorskii and Victorson on reflexology for cancer symptom management in 2007 and explored methodologies in CAM intervention trials in 2009-2010. He began his research on reflexology for advanced breast cancer in 2012-2013, studied clinical trials on caregiver-provided reflexology in 2015-2017, and began a number of ongoing randomized controlled trials for symptom management through family caregiver-provided reflexology for patients with advanced breast cancer in 2018-2021. Today, Wyatt is committed to researching the pain and psychological impact of reflexology on women with advanced breast cancer. As such, foot reflexology has progressed to the level of research that enhances patients' psychological comfort to reduce pain. 3.4. Research Institutions [Table 3](#healthcare-11-00009-t003). In this study, the institutional attributes of the top 15 research institutions were obtained by a Google query. From 1991 to 2021, Michigan State University (the United States) appeared the most frequently (32 times), which was twice as often as Northwestern University (USA) in second place (15 times). The top 15 institutions were mostly medical universities (53%), research universities (40%), and government units (7%). The top three institutions in terms of independent journal publication capacity were Michigan State University (11 articles), which focused on breast cancer patients and reflexology, followed by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (8 articles), which focused on epilepsy patients. The third place was taken by Iran's Tabriz University of Medical Science (6 articles), which studied multiple applications of reflexology (including elderly sleep, women in labor, and adult coronary artery surgery). This study found that inter-institutional collaborations and co-publications were common, with a maximum of 16 institutions and a minimum of 2. The mode of collaboration was mostly a consortium of national university research institutions, but multinational research institutions and banks were also involved. 3.5. Collaborative Network of Prolific Authors and Research Institutions [Figure 6](#healthcare-11-00009-f006)represents the frequency of collaboration. The same color of a line means the same research topic, and the color change of a line between two points means that after collaborating for a period of time, the research direction changed. If the colors are similar at first, it means the research topic is highly similar. The red dots represent the three authors, Victorson, Wyatt, and Rahbar, who collaborated most closely with Northwestern University and the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston on the topic. The blue dots represent collaborations between Sikorskii, Frames, and Michigan State University. The green dots represent Badger, Lehto, and Tesnjak's collaborations with Michigan State University and the University of Arizona. The yellow dots represent Sikorskii and Tamkus' affiliation with Northwestern University. The purple dots represent Wyatt's cross-collaboration with Michigan State University across different research themes. The same authors worked on different areas of foot reflexology [ [57](#B57-healthcare-11-00009)]. The collaborative network of highly productive authors and research institutions is shown in [Figure 4](#healthcare-11-00009-f004). 3.6. Popular Keywords [59](#B59-healthcare-11-00009)], as shown in [Figure 7](#healthcare-11-00009-f007). 3.6.1. Evolution of Keywords over the Years [60](#B60-healthcare-11-00009)]; \"massage\" appeared for the first time in 1996; \"foot reflexology\" appeared for the first time in 1997; and \"complementary medicine\" appeared for the first time in 1998. Next, the most common keyword-related topics were anxiety, with 45 papers mentioning this keyword for 11 consecutive years out of the 31; quality of life, with 23 papers listing it for 8 out of 31 years; fatigue, with 19 papers listing it for 11 out of 31 years, with 19 papers; and sleep, with 14 papers listing it for 7 out of 31 years. Among the disease categories, reflexology was mainly investigated in relation to cancer, chemotherapy, lower back pain, hemodialysis, constipation, coronary angiography, and other topics. In the discussion related to women, foot reflexology for pregnancy was used as a keyword continuously for 9 out of 31 years, with 12 papers, while foot reflexology for breast cancer was used as a keyword continuously for 7 years out of 31 years, with 8 papers total. The development of foot reflexology is described below. In the initial nascent stage (1991-2006), alternative therapies, massage, and foot reflexology generated the first concepts and theoretical discussions. It was not until the primary growth phase (2007-2015) that quality of life, anxiety, fatigue, sleep, pregnancy, and breast cancer began to be studied as topics. In recent years, during the rapid growth phase (after 2016), research related to foot reflexology has expanded to explore its role in CAM and related applications, including hemodialysis, prosopagnosia, constipation, chest pain, intensive care unit case symptom management, and comparison of pre- and post-surgical intervention trials. In addition, this study found annual publications in the field of foot reflexology containing topics such as massage, anxiety, fatigue, and cancer over a five-year period from 2017-2021. 3.6.2. Keyword Co-Occurrence clusters in different colors: (1) orange, representing foot reflexology and female status; (2) red, representing foot reflexology and quality of life; (3) light blue, representing foot reflexology as CAM; (4) dark blue, representing foot reflexology and cancer research; and (5) light yellow, representing foot reflexology and CAM system evaluation. 3.7. Highly Cited Papers [61](#B61-healthcare-11-00009)]. This study found 15 highly cited papers in foot reflexology research (with 100 citations), as shown in [Table 4](#healthcare-11-00009-t004). Most of the highly cited papers with more than 100 citations were published during the initial nascent stage (1999-2005, eight papers) and the primary growth stage (2006-2015, seven papers), which laid the cornerstone for the later rapid development of foot reflexology. 3.8. Future Research Directions [Figure 9](#healthcare-11-00009-f009). In terms of the number of publications, these ten major categories are the main directions of future foot reflexology research. The ten research directions account for 61% of the publications related to foot reflexology, indicating that the applications of foot reflexology are no longer a single direction of research but focus more on the breadth and depth of research in medical, nursing, and psychological applications. At the same time, these directions are also the future research trends of preventive medicine [ [7](#B7-healthcare-11-00009), [62](#B62-healthcare-11-00009)]. 4. Discussion [57](#B57-healthcare-11-00009), [63](#B63-healthcare-11-00009)]. This study was based on a literature review and comparison with research results that could be used as a basis for the future development of the field of foot reflexology [ [56](#B56-healthcare-11-00009)]. The results of the analysis are summarized below. - The research publications on foot reflexology from 1991 to 2021 could be divided into three stages: (1) the initial nascent stage; (2) the primary growth stage; and (3) the rapid development stage. As for the current phase of rapid development, the number of publications has increased year by year, from 1 paper in 1991 to 102 papers in 2021, an increase of 102 times, indicating that academics have begun paying more attention to foot reflexology. - Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice is the most published journal, and although its influence factor was not the first among the top 10 journals, it has been gradually gaining attention and influence over the past 31 years. The influence factor of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was 9.289, indicating the high quality of its included papers and its strong influence in the field of foot reflexology, as well as its importance as a source of information for research on foot reflexology. Another factor to consider is that researchers are now wanting to research reflexology and journals are more willing to publish CAM research. - Wyatt, Victorson, and Sikorskii are among the more active scholars in the field of foot reflexology research publications and they have established numerous extensive collaborations. - Michigan State University, Northwestern University, the University of Exeter, and the University of Tehran were found to be the core institutions for foot reflexology research. - Regarding the prolific authors and collaboration networks of research institutions, this study found that Victorson, Wyatt, and Rahbar have worked closely with Northwestern University and the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston; Sikorskii and Frames have worked closely with Michigan State University; and Badger, Lehto, and Tesnjak have worked closely with Michigan State University, which is the largest institution in terms of cross-collaboration across different research themes. Michigan State University is the largest institution in terms of cross-collaboration across different research themes, with strong cross-collaboration often occurring between different authors and institutions. - According to the statistics of the authors' keyword usage, the top 15 keywords were reflexology, CAM, massage, pain, anxiety, nursing, quality of life, cancer, fatigue, breast cancer, complementary medicine, pregnancy, multiple sclerosis, constipation, and chemotherapy. - The number-one cited paper was published in 2001 by Thomas, Nicholl, and Coleman and titled \"Use and Expenditure on Complementary Medicine in England: A Population Based Survey\", which has been cited 451 times. - Research on foot reflexology involves research in integrative complementary medicine, nursing, oncology, medicine, neuroscience and pathology, psychology, health care science and services, rehabilitation, sociobiological sciences, and obstetrics and gynecology from a whole-person care perspective. Limitations and Recommendations - The search was mainly focused on the Web of Science; Web of Science was used because it is a popular scholarly search system for experts and researchers, and it has numerous high-quality publishing houses and academic papers. - Web of Science did not find any of the studies on labor duration and pain which is a limitation. - In this study, only the annual number of publications, journals, prolific authors, research institutions, authors and collaboration networks of research institutions, keywords, highly cited papers, and research fields were considered. Future studies should develop more diversified directions or do a cross-analysis of empirical research cases. At the same time, interviews with experts, technicians, and people who have received foot reflexology should be conducted to compare the differences between foot reflexology and traditional foot massage, as the design and development of foot reflexology hand tools could be promoted by understanding the feelings of the recipients. All of the above will lead to more breakthroughs and discoveries in foot reflexology, which is expected to bring more multidimensional thoughts and provide cross-disciplinary support to human beings. 5.
