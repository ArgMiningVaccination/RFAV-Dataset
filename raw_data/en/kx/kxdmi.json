But some [lifestyle changes and home remedies](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/living-an-active-life-with-rheumatoid-arthritis/) may help your recovery while undergoing conventional treatment. Alternative and complementary therapies that fall outside of conventional Western medicine may provide additional relief. Lifestyle Changes, Exercises, and Home Remedies for Easing RA Symptoms Lifestyle changes and home treatments help decrease RA symptoms and improve functioning. If you have RA, it's important to remain active; if you don't, you may experience increased joint instability as your muscles around your joints become weak and your tendons and other soft tissues become inflamed. In fact, exercise is considered an essential aspect of RA treatment, and typically consists of stretching, range-of-motion exercises, and aerobic [strength training](https://www.everydayhealth.com/fitness/add-strength-training-to-your-workout.aspx). ( [1](https://nyulangone.org/conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults/treatments/lifestyle-changes-for-rheumatoid-arthritis)) A [physical therapist](https://www.everydayhealth.com/pain-management/physical-activity-and-therapy.aspx) can design an exercise program for you to maintain at home, with [exercises](https://www.everydayhealth.com/fitness/guide/) that will help keep your joints as flexible as possible, and also keep your muscles strong \u2014 further relieving pressure on your joints. Physical activity should be balanced with [rest](//www.everydayhealth.com/sleep-disorders/sleep/sleep-101-ultimate-guide-on-how-get-better-nights-sleep/), which can help reduce [joint inflammation and the associated symptoms of pain, stiffness, and swelling](//www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/living-with/10-essential-facts-about-inflammation-rheumatoid-arthritis/). Dealing With Rheumatoid Arthritis Flare-Ups First, call your doctor if you experience a [flare-up](https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-management/ra-flare-prevention/) of pain and [inflammation](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/living-with/10-essential-facts-about-inflammation-rheumatoid-arthritis/). If they are in agreement, you can try: [Heat treatments](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/treatment/hot-and-cold-therapy/), such as packs or warm baths, to soothe stiff joints and tired muscles; or cold treatments for acute pain ( [2](https://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/treatments/natural/other-therapies/heat-cold-pain-relief.php)) - Over-the-counter topical ointments, such as [Voltaren](/drugs/diclofenac)gel or Tiger Balm arthritis rub - Specialized braces or [splints](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/treatment/ra-resting-joints-braces-splints/)that support the joints and allow them to rest [Self-help devices](https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-management/assistive-devices/), such as zipper pullers and long-handled shoehorns, to ease stress on your joints during daily activities ( [3](https://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/pain-management/joint-protection/arthritis-devices.php)) It's also important to maintain a healthy emotional state. Though there's no evidence that stress itself can cause rheumatoid arthritis, it may affect the severity of your RA symptoms and [pain](https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/emotional-well-being/stress-management/how-stress-affects-arthritis). [Relaxation techniques](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/living-with/rheumatoid-arthritis-stress/), visualization exercises, group counseling, and therapy (such as cognitive behavioral therapy) can help you deal with the [inevitable stresses](//www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/living-with/rheumatoid-arthritis-stress/) of living with RA. ( [4](https://pennstatehershey.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=10&pid=10&gid=000048)) Complementary or Alternative Therapies for Easing Rheumatoid Arthritis Symptoms Some [complementary or alternative therapies](/hs/rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-management/complementary-therapies/) may play a role in RA treatment. These therapies include the following: - Homeopathy: treatment built upon the belief that \"like cures like,\" so treating symptoms with small amounts of natural substances that produce similar symptoms in healthy people. [Turmeric](/drugs/turmeric), arnica, and [poison ivy](/poison-ivy/)are often used to treat RA. - Magnet therapy: exposing painful joints to magnets, which purportedly correct disruptions in the body's energy field - Hydrotherapy: exercise performed in water, including water [aerobics](/fitness/workouts/why-you-need-aerobic-exercise.aspx)and swimming - Balneotherapy: immersing yourself in mineral-rich waters, such as hot or cold springs [Cryotherapy](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/living-with/does-cryotherapy-help-treat-rheumatoid-arthritis-pain/): exposing your body or achy joints to extreme cold for a short time - Sauna therapy: exposing your body to heat to warm your core temperature ( [5](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2018/1857413/)) But studies looking into these therapies for RA have found no benefits or are inconclusive, sometimes due to small numbers of participants or poor study designs. ( [6](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/RA/getthefacts.htm#hed1), [7](https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/patient-corner/disease-management/ra-complementary-alternative-medicine/), [8](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis-beyond-the-basics)) You should always check with your medical provider before trying any complementary or alternative therapies. Other such therapies include [acupuncture](https://www.everydayhealth.com/chronic-pain/what-is-acupuncture-can-it-help-chronic-pain/), tai chi, and [yoga](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/treatment/best-worst-types-yoga-rheumatoid-arthritis/), which research suggests may be more promising. Acupuncture for Rheumatoid Arthritis Symptom Relief [Acupuncture](https://www.everydayhealth.com/alternative-health/what-is-acupuncture-a-beginners-guide-to-how-it-works-and-how-it-may-improve-your-health/) has long been used to treat pain. And while numerous studies have investigated the needle-based technique for pain treatment, few have focused specifically on rheumatoid arthritis \u2014 and those that have were small and poorly designed, according to UpToDate [, a physician-authored website. (8)](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics) Overall, studies examining the effectiveness of [acupuncture](/alternative-health/what-is-acupuncture-a-beginners-guide-to-how-it-works-and-how-it-may-improve-your-health/) for management of RA-related pain are inconclusive. While some studies have shown potential benefits, the conclusions are inconsistent and more studies are needed. ( [9](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003788.pub2/full)) Additionally, a review of complementary and alternative therapies for RA found no benefit of acupuncture over \"sham acupuncture\" for pain relief. ( [11](https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/51/12/2224/1802433)) But one study in that review found that [people with RA](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/) who received acupuncture felt better about the state of the disease. A Taiwanese review published in April 2018 in the journal Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine concluded that acupuncture is \"worth trying\" and can improve function and quality of life for patients with RA. However, the authors, whose work focuses on Chinese medicine, noted that there's a lack of well-designed studies and clinical efficacy regarding acupuncture for RA. ( [12](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2018/8596918/)) Tai Chi and Yoga for Lessening RA Symptoms [Tai chi](https://www.everydayhealth.com/chronic-pain/qigong-and-tai-chi-how-can-they-help-chronic-pain/) hasn't yet been thoroughly investigated for RA \u2014 and many studies that do exist were conducted before the current drugs for RA were available \u2014 so it's unclear if tai chi is effective for RA, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). (6) With that said, tai chi, which is a form of low-impact exercise, appears to be safe to try for RA and doesn't exacerbate RA symptoms. Though tai chi may not reduce the inflammation-related [symptoms of RA](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/symptoms/), a review published in November 2016 in the journal Canadian Family Physician found that the practice may confer some benefits for [depression and anxiety](https://www.everydayhealth.com/anxiety/anxiety-and-depression.aspx), lung disease, [fibromyalgia](https://www.everydayhealth.com/fibromyalgia/guide/), and lower [back pain](https://www.everydayhealth.com/pain-management/back-pain/quick-tips-to-help-prevent-back-pain.aspx) \u2014 all issues that people with RA may also experience. ( [13](https://www.cfp.ca/content/62/11/881.long)) Some individual studies have found that [yoga](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/treatment/best-worst-types-yoga-rheumatoid-arthritis/) may help people [living with rheumatoid arthritis](/rheumatoid-arthritis/everyday-guide-to-living-well/) by improving physical function, increasing grip strength, and reducing inflammation \u2014 specifically decreasing the number of tender and swollen joints. These studies have also shown that some forms of [yoga](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/treatment/best-worst-types-yoga-rheumatoid-arthritis/) can reduce pain, disability, and fatigue, and improve health, mood, and quality of life. ( [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3644391/), [15](https://www.jrheum.org/content/42/7/1194)) And in an Indian study published in February 2019 in the journal Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience, researchers found that [practicing yoga](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/treatment/best-worst-types-yoga-rheumatoid-arthritis/) five days a week for two months can significantly decrease the severity of physical and psychological [symptoms of RA](/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/symptoms/). ( [16](https://content.iospress.com/articles/restorative-neurology-and-neuroscience/rnn180875)) But systematic reviews have found mixed evidence for yoga for people with RA. (6) If you do decide to try yoga for RA, avoid Bikram yoga and other high-intensity forms of yoga. (1) Can Supplements Help Improve Rheumatoid Arthritis Symptoms? It's important to discuss supplements with your doctor before starting them, because many herbal supplements are not rigorously studied by the FDA and may potentially interfere with other prescription medications. That said, numerous dietary supplements have been proposed for RA treatment, and research suggests that some of them appear promising. [Fish oil](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/diet/), for instance, contains high levels of [omega-3 fatty acids](//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/omega-3s/), and studies have suggested that this substance may help relieve tender joints and morning stiffness, reducing the need for anti-inflammatory drugs. But [fish oil](/drugs/fish-oil) should be used with caution because it can interact with [blood pressure medication](//www.everydayhealth.com/high-blood-pressure/guide/treatment/). A review published January 2017 in the journal Nutrients found that marine oil supplements (all oils of marine origin, including from whole fish, seals, and mussels) can help reduce pain in patients with RA. ( [17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5295086/)) Plant Oils and Essential Oils That May Help Ease Symptoms Plant oils, such as black currant seed, [evening primrose](/drugs/evening-primrose), and borage seed, may also be beneficial as they contain omega-6 fatty acids \u2014 specifically gamma-linolenic acid, or GLA. A Cochran review of herbal therapies in RA found that these oils, in addition to omega-3 fatty acids, probably improve pain, may improve function, and likely don't increase unwanted side effects in people with RA. ( [18](https://www.cochrane.org/CD002948/MUSKEL_herbal-therapy-for-rheumatoid-arthritis)) In a report published in June 2015 in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, researchers found that combining the herbal remedy Triperygium wilfordii Hook F (thunder god vine) with [methotrexate](//www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/trexall) \u2014 a common [RA medication](/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/medications/) \u2014 works better than the methotrexate ( [Trexall](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/trexall)) alone. ( [19](https://ard.bmj.com/content/74/6/1078)) But this herbal remedy can cause severe side effects that may not be worth the intended benefits, according to the NCCIH. (6) What About Turmeric and Other Medicinal Foods for Pain Relief? Research has shown that curcumin \u2014 a major active component of [turmeric](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/turmeric-curcumin-benefits-side-effects-types-more/) \u2014 also has anti-inflammatory properties that may make it helpful for RA and numerous other conditions. A review published in August 2016 in the Journal of Medicinal Food found that there's scientific evidence that curcumin could help with RA, but it's difficult to draw definitive conclusions due to the quality and size of the studies reviewed. ( [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003001/)) Because curcumin is rapidly removed from the body, several formulations exist on the market to increase its bioavailability \u2014 how much of the substance circulates in the body. Curcumin is generally safe, but as always, talk to your doctor before taking it.
