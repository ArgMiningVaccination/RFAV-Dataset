COBHA is proud toannouncethenew book by COBHA director and instructor Elizabeth Jones: Written for both lay readers and practitioners, Awakento Healing Fragrance is divided into three parts structured around the past, present, and future of aromatherapy. The book begins with profiles of prominent female historical figures \u2014 from Cleopatra to Elizabeth I \u2014 known to have used essential oils for mind, body, and spiritual health. Part two explains the value of aromatherapy today: modern methods for using essential oils\u2014from relaxation practices like massage and facials to treating common conditions like PMS, stress, and a sore throat \u2014 and describes how and why they work. Also featured are case studies, research on anti-infectious qualities of the oils, the chemistry of essential oils and a section on psychoneuroimmunology that shows how essential oils can help restore the mind-body-spirit connection and create balance. Awaken to Healing Fragrance concludes by exploring the future of essential oil therapy and how it can be integrated into traditional medical systems. Jones discusses energetic medicine, creating aromatic gardens, and establishing integrative medicine clinics where doctors trained in Western medicine would collaborate with alternative therapists such as acupuncturists, nutritionists, and aromatherapists to bring a new consciousness and sense of well-being to healthcare.
