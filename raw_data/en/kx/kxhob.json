If you haven't done so already, we encourage you to sign up for a MyScripps proxy account if you are the parent or guardian of a minor. This will allow you to schedule a vaccine appointment for your child. Log in to your MyScripps account, go to [request access to a minor](https://myscripps.org/MyChart/inside.asp?mode=showform&formName=CustSvcRequestMinorAccess) and submit a form for each child you'd like access to.

Your digital COVID-19 vaccine record is an electronic vaccination record available in your [MyScripps patient portal](https://myscripps.org/MyChart/default.asp). If you did not receive your vaccine at a Scripps location and don't see it in MyScripps, you can generate a QR code through the [State of California](https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/). How can I update my medical record? If you received one or both of your COVID-19 vaccine doses outside of a Scripps Health facility, we may have already received vaccine records from other vaccination locations in California and automatically updated your medical records. If not, you can update your COVID vaccine history through your MyScripps account once you have received both doses. Log into [MyScripps](https://myscripps.org/MyChart/default.asp) and go to My Record > COVID-19. From there you can click to pull in your vaccine history from outside of Scripps, or upload an image of your vaccine card. Vaccine FAQs How much does the COVID-19 vaccine cost? The federal government will cover the cost of the vaccine itself. Your insurance may be billed for the cost to administer the vaccine to you. However, there is no out-of-pocket cost to you.
