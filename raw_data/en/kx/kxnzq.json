Have you ever run into a situation where your little one has a cough, fever, or earache late at night after the stores are closed, and you just wished you had the right remedies in your medicine cabinet or pantry? This natural home medicine checklist, with this accompanying [FREE downloadable PDF](https://avivaromm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Herbal-Natural-Medicine-Chest-1.pdf) from my course [Healthy All Year](http://healthiestkids.com/healthy-all-year/), contains the remedies that you are likely to find in other articles on my website, that help you troubleshoot common kids' conditions like colds, ear infections, coughs, fever, and more. I also include the basic kitchen supplies you'll want to have on-hand if you plan to make your own remedies from the course or my [Herbal Medicines for Kids] Ebook, which is also free. I recommend keeping 2 ounces of the bulk herbs in stock at home, and 1-2 oz. of the liquid extracts/tinctures. A half oz. of the essential oils is plenty. Stored out of direct sunlight and away from heat, the dried herbs last for a couple of years, the tinctures 3-5 years, and the oils 1-2 years.
