Stay up-to-date with vaccines - The primary series (monovalent) Pfizer and Moderna vaccines used from 2020 through March 2023 are no longer available. Instead, all Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are bivalent (contain 2 virus strains) and offer protection against the strains of COVID-19 virus that have been active more recently. - Everyone age 6 years and up should get a dose of the bivalent vaccine, if they have not yet. - People 65 years and older who have received one dose of the bivalent vaccine may receive one additional dose, at least 4 months after their initial dose. - People with [weak immune systems](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html)who have already received the bivalent vaccine may choose to receive one additional dose, at least 2 months after their initial dose. For people with weak immune systems who are between 6 months and 5 years of age, their eligibility for additional doses will depend on the vaccine they previously received. - Children 6 months through 5 years of age who have already received one, two, or three doses of the monovalent vaccine should receive one to two doses of the bivalent vaccine. The number of doses recommended will depend on which vaccine they have already received and the number of doses received. If you are unvaccinated - Everyone age 6 years and up who is unvaccinated should get one dose of the bivalent vaccine. Multiple doses are not required, except that people with [weak immune systems](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html)are recommended to get an additional bivalent vaccine dose at least 2 months after the first, and people age 65 years and older may choose to get an additional bivalent dose at least 4 months after the first. - Children aged 6 months through 4 years who are currently unvaccinated may receive either: - A two-dose series of the Moderna bivalent vaccine - A three-dose series of the Pfizer bivalent vaccine - Children who are 5 years of age and currently unvaccinated may receive two doses of the Moderna bivalent vaccine or one dose of the Pfizer bivalent vaccine.
