People from many years ago did not have specialized doctors and medicine to cure their diseases that we easily have access to today. (Ramsey) Many civilizations used what they thought to be alleviating processes, but medical experts today know now were pointless and dangerous. Among these people were the Elizabethans. (Chamberline) The Elizabethan Era was a time of accusations. People believed certain procedures were curing people when in fact they were killing them. (Ramsey) They also blamed mysterious acts they could not explain on innocent people, creating a handful of superstitions we know and use today. Unexplainable events and hazardous medical customs sparked the era of the Elizabethan Age. (Elizabethan Superstitions) civilization raised or how the people lived? How they regulated their lands? Or what they used to eat? Etc. One of the aspects that many people are curious about is the old-world medicine, how ancient people dealt with illnesses and how they treated their patients? As for the American civilization, the most recorded advanced medicine was in the Aztec's empire. The Aztec's Empire was the most powerful Mesoamerican kingdom of old ages. In fact, their culture was full of creativity with a combination of methodology and religious tradition. They arrived in the Valley of Mexico in 1325C.E, and their name means Aztlan people, where they were originally from. In fact, The Elizabethan time period was from 1558 through 1603 known as the Renaissance. During the Renaissance there was not any running water, so people would have to throw their waste in the streets. With people's waste in the street came many illnesses including The Plague. Even a minor scrap could kill you in the next minute. When people got sick they needed medicine, physicians, and health care. In the late 1500 there was not a great deal medican, there was mostly just spiritual analysis. Medicine during the Elizabethan Era was extremely basic. The knowledge most people had about medicine came from their ancestors through many generations. The Elizabethan Era was a time when terrible illnesses such as the Black Plague were killing nearly one-third of the population. The cause of many illnesses during this time was lack of sanitation. Back then, women played a major role in medicine. They often nursed the sick using home remedies that were passed down from generation to generation. The start of the period known as \"Classical Greece\" starts at around 800 B.C.E. and ends around 400 B.C.E. Classical Greece tells tales of Athens against Sparta, the Peloponnesian War. But that is only some of the events, as the achievements are a feat to behold. New branches of mathematics, such as geometry established new theorems, columns were prominently used in buildings of importance, and the first Olympics were first held to honor the gods and celebrate human achievement. The contributions of classical Greece are seen in Western civilization in the continuation of the Olympics, in the realistic depiction of subjects in various forms of art, in the development of medical ethics, in the architectural use of columns in the Western building The earliest medical ideas developed by Greeks and Romans have affected modern day medical principles. Although modernized and based upon to suit our continually evolving society, numerous occasions, practices and conventions that were started years, decades and hundreds of years ago; the medical principles that were developed by the Greeks and Romans are still continued today. The ancient Greek and Roman medical practices have laid the foundations of medicine and medical practices that we utilize today. After people such as Hippocrates and Claudius Galen, who created new developments in the field of medicine, professionals could utilize the prior revelations to get a more detailed knowledge of surgical procedures and diagnosis of diseases. Muslims the people of Islam, have inherited of their culture from Greece, Rome, and India, as well as from those that they have conquered. The Muslims have great tolerance for those that they conquered and because of this they were able to advance scholarship to its highest level, in several areas. As a result of this, the achievements that the Muslims have achieved stand out, and have a long lasting impact on the cultures of our world today. The Black Death plagued through Europe for several centuries without the people having a means of fighting the disease off. The Black Death was also known as the bubonic plague. This plague wreaked havoc through the Western world in 1347 (Backman 348). The plague was thought to have been carried into Western Europe by rats brought in on ships from eastern Asia. It is thought that the progression of the disease was due to the violent advance of the Mongol army into Europe (Backman 348). The plague killed over fifty million in an insignificant amount of time. The deaths were due to the people of the Western world having no built up immunity to The more traditional framework that would have been used would have been the scientific biomedical framework. This framework is a model that does not take into consideration the psychological and social factors which may be contributing to a person's illness; the illness is simply seen in biological terms. This ideology is far outdated, and one can see this simply by reading the WHO's most recent definition of health, mentioned in the opening of this paper. This model views medications as the resolution to all illnesses, however we know that in today's society, medications can often cause further problems- for example the creation of superbugs such as MRSA in the hospital system, bugs that as a result of overexposure to antibiotics have now become immune to the medication's effects, and can therefore be detrimental to a patient's health. By choosing to concentrate merely on biological impacts on health, a vast array of other factors, such as the environment, the money invested in public health care systems and many more, are ignored. However, in today's contemporary society there are new frameworks to consider that challenge the traditional framework in many ways, but also contribute to the complexity of defining health. One such framework is the socio-medical model of health. This model takes many factors in account when discussing ones health, and accepts that disease can be multi-causal. I mentioned earlier that people are taking responsibility for their own health, and although this remains true, some factors which may contribute to disease are out of our control- for example certain toxins that we may be exposed to in our environment, Chernobyl being an example of a catastrophic nuclear disaster impacting on the health of people in the surrounding area for generations. Socio-economic factors also have an enormous effect on a person's The history of the science that precedes medicine is always centuries behind where it ought to be, because it takes centuries for new information to be accepted by the established orthodoxy, and, right now, we're in the midst of an emerging new paradigm and the passing of an old one, which makes it hard to know who and what to trust. Medical advancements and knowledge played a major role in the prosperity of Islam. In paragraph one, line one, it states that Muslim doctors studied the works and achievements from many other cultures. Studying other culture's advancements in the medical field helped propel Islamic medical knowledge forward by combining ideas from multiple cultures. Using this combined knowledge, in paragraph two, line one, Muslim doctors discover that bacteria is the source of infection. Doctors were able to use this knowledge to better understand diseases, and to treat and cure infected people. These advancements lead to a healthier society, and meant Hippocrates is very significant to the history of medicine because he changed medicine, influenced physicians for centuries, and developed a system useful for curing illness. His works and ideas changed medicine from relying on religion and home remedies to reasoning and observation. He is known as the father of medicine and is recognized today as an important figure in medicine. With the rise of empires, raises the cultural experiences and the creation of their own deities. From Egyptian nights to Greek sky, to which that means having share the same similarities, but an equal discrepancy in for the formation of beliefs, Greeks and Egyptians alike. Through the profoundly mundane characteristic Islam is a complete code of life and the life of every single aspect of the game is highlighted. Physical and spiritual teachings of Allah and complete cure for internal and external diseases. Prophet Muhammad numerous lawful, good things are clear advantages and told how to use. Modern science, Syed blessings Allah has full compatibility with words. '' Prophet Muhammad medicine ', have profited from the Muslims. Mental disorders have been treated over time starting as early as 5,000BC. Three of the most pivotal times in history began with the Neolithic Era commonly known as the New Stone Age. Following that is the Middle Ages which then lead us to present day. The ways of treatment have gradually changed with the development of new science and medicine. The knowledge needed to advance medical treatments have come from thousands of years of trial and error. Medicine is still improving each day leading doctors to find new ways to better treat mental disorders. "}
