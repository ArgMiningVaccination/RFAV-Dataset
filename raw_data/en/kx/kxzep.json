I don't know exactly how it began, but I became obsessed with science. Science combined with spirit. I was constantly thinking about hope and possibility in the new world. I dug deeply into quantum physics, biology, epigenetics, fractals, string theory, feedback loops, entanglement theory, ancient civilizations, critical mass, and most important of all, the power of the mind. During this time I had three young adults living with me on a gap year from college. My daughter Emma, her partner Hank, and my godson Terry. My son Spencer was 2,000 miles away in Arizona, taking his gap year. I felt extremely responsible for these beings who were looking up to me for answers and comfort. I refused to sink into negativity or fear. I found amazing teachers and healers: Dr. Joe Dispenza, Dr. Kim D'Eramo, Wim Hof, Elizabeth April, Nassim Haramien, Bruce Lipton, Meg Benedict, and Gregg Bradon to name a few. While in quarantine I encouraged the family to gather nightly. Together we ate gourmet meals, wrote poetry, painted, did live stream music concerts, and had many, many deep discussions about how to help the planet and humanity. We talked about expansion, paradigm shifts, unity, love, and how to raise our vibrational frequency. Along with studying and discussions we dove into Joe Dispenza's guided meditations. It was during one of these mediations that I had a clear vision of a new musical ensemble. As the months went on I kept having little snippet visions about the new ensemble. I saw a cello, I heard the music, I began to compose (which was strange because I was not yet a composer, just an arranger of music), I saw a bio video, and even heard the word 'blue.' The ensemble and music kept forming bit by bit. Now we have a six piece-band with a song writer (my daughter Emma), a poet/spoken-word/rap artist (my godson, Terry) and a video component. We just released our first track on March 17, \"Liminal\" and are releasing another one, \"Magic Wand\" on April 7. In addition we are releasing an EP \"Heart Space Suite\" in May and a full album, \"Liminal Spaces\" in June. Blue is described as a \"mystical, neo-classic, jam\" with shades of classical, jazz, pop, gospel, and meditation music. I am staying very quiet about \"Blue,\" replacing my usual energy of try, push, strive, work, etcetera, with the energy of ease, fluidity, flow, balance, and patience. We will see where Blue is meant to go. I have no expectations, just enjoying the ride and having a desire to share this music.

Born in Lansing, she moved to Ann Arbor when she was 14 years old and has stayed here ever since. She refers to herself as a Modality Museum, and rightly so. Over the course of her life, she has practiced and become immersed in yoga, aromatherapy, essential oils, homeopathy, craniosacral therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, energy medicine using Donna Eden's method, and more. For over 20 years, she's been an Energy Medicine practitioner. She studied with Donna Eden herself back in the late 90s and early 2000s, before a certification program existed. (Energy Medicine is a modality of healing developed by Donna Eden that incorporates techniques from yoga, acupuncture, kinesiology, qi gong, and those developed by Donna herself.) Scholz says, \"It's kind of like acupuncture, but you use your hands instead of needles to work with the energy.\" As one of the first teachers of the Eden Energy Method (EEM) program, Scholz has acted as student, teacher, and practitioner. Since the initiation of the EEM program, she has been involved in its evolution into a rigorous and instructive four-year course in which students learn fundamental skills about working with energy and can eventually become certified, skilled practitioners themselves. Scholz has served as a guide to help others heal, and her practice is full and thriving. She serves as a practitioner at her cozy home near Argo Canoe Livery and the Huron River. She spends much of her free time tending to her biodynamic garden which she has cultivated for over 45 years.Grace Pernecky: Let's start at the beginning. Where were you born and raised? What sorts of occupations did your parents have? Where do you live now? Barb Scholz: I was born in Lansing, Michigan. I lived there for the first 14 years of my life, and at age 14, we moved to Ann Arbor. It's been my home ever since. I went to Slauson, Pioneer, and then to the University of Michigan. My dad is a mechanical engineer and self-taught electrical engineer. He still plays with his computers at age 99! When I was growing up my mom didn't work, but she did bookkeeping before she had kids. Then, she did the bookkeeping for my dad's business when my siblings and I had grown up. I've lived in this house for 46 years. I love this place. My sister owned it before I did and sold it to me when she went away to college. Grace Pernecky: What is your earliest memory of having thoughts of pursuing a career in healing? Barb Scholz: It was kind of an odd journey. I was really interested in going into science and math. So, I got my degree in mathematics from U of M. But in high school, I began reading about alternative healing. In my early 20s, I started taking every workshop I could on various forms of bodywork. During my 20s and 30s, I was always studying something or taking workshops: yoga, homeopathy, Chinese medicine, herbal medicine, ayurvedic medicine, craniosacral therapy, massage therapy, polarity therapy, aromatherapy and more. When I was 47, in 1997, I was diagnosed with optic neuritis, which involved inexplicably losing sight in both The Crazy Wisdom Biweekly, March 31, 202311 The Crazy Wisdom Biweekly, March 31, 202312of my eyes for six weeks. The doctors told me within two years, 50% of people with this condition get MS, which shocked the heck out of me. That started me on a journey of searching far and wide for alternative health treatments because I already knew what standard medical care was going to advise. Through a series of serendipitous events, and after months of searching for alternative treatments, I found out about Donna Eden and Energy Medicine and immediately felt drawn to it. GP: Why did you feel drawn to this particular modality? And how did you go from student to practitioner? BS: Donna's story is that she had MS and cured herself. When I learned this, I knew that she would be my teacher. I signed up for every workshop she taught. Her methodology and her techniques are so focused on self-care, which was very different from the model I'd been working within where people would work on me, and I would have to wait till the next session. During that wait period, I would start to fall apart. To have someone teach me things that I could do for myself was a game changer. I became a very devoted practitioner of self-care, and I started to improve. It was this slow rebuilding of my immune system's response by way of correcting imbalances in my energy field that brought me back to wellness. It was transformational. Over the course of CONTINUED ONLINE AT CRAZY WISDOM JOURNAL \"These things aren't explained in the scientific model. But if you're a good empirical scientist, you don't throw away data. Y ou go, \"Even though I can't explain it that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Even though I don't understand it, that doesn't mean that it isn't worth exploring, to see if I can begin to understand it differently.\" \u2014 Barb Scholz a few years, entirely by word-of-mouth, I started teaching and then working on people myself. I loved to teach and share, but I was not really going to \"work\" on people. I was quite resistant to the idea of becoming a practitioner and having a business. I already had a full-time job as a medical software developer and project manager. Starting a practice of seeing people did not seem realistic. Barb Scholz can be reached at: bscholz@comcast.net.

Click to sign up for our newsletterThe Crazy Wisdom Biweekly, March 31, 202316Selenite is a calcium sulfate, or salt (meaning it will dissolve in water), and is the transparent variety of gypsum, as opposed to the more fibrous satin spar or massive alabaster. It has a hardness of two. Selenite is one of our most beloved stones; the name comes from a Greek origin, meaning \"moon, in allusion to the moon-like white reflections of the mineral or to the quality of the light transmitted\" through it. Its element is wind and its most often used for clearing energy\u2014in the auric field, the physical body or the subtle bodies. It will dissolve blockages in the subtle body, allowing for a better flow of energy. Selenite can open and stimulate the third eye and crown chakras and aid with communion with the higher self. It also amplifies the energy of other stones around it, as in a grid. It's a wonderful addition to an altar or to hold during meditation. The selenite specimen shown above has fishtail twinned crystals and is from Laguna del Rey, Ocampo, Coahuila, Mexico (from my personal collection). I have other selenite specimens available on my Facebook page, Bright Earth Crystals and Minerals. Contact me at ulrichfineminerals@gmail.com if interested.

Searching for Self with Venerable Thubten Chodron Wednesdays, April 5, 12, 19, and 26 7 to 8:30 p.m. In this series of talks, Venerable Chodron will explore emptiness, one of the most central teachings in Buddhism, drawing from the seventh and newest volume of her Library of Wisdom and Compassion series with the Dalai Lama. \"Searching for the Self\" leads us to delve deeply into the topic of the ultimate nature of reality, presenting it from a variety of approaches while focusing on identifying our erroneous views and directing us to the actual mode of existence of all persons and phenomena. Engaging in this investigation will challenge our deepest-held beliefs and uproot false ways of viewing ourselves and the world that are so habitual we don't even notice them.

Camp JUMP-IN 2023 Intensive Therapy Camp July 17 9 a.m. Camp JUMP-IN 2023 Intensive Therapy Camp. First, therapy camp benefits children with sensory processing difficulties, learning problems, apraxia*, in-coordination, low muscle tone, auditory processing dysfunction, and other neurological delays or disorders. We use the \"Frequency, Intensity, Duration Model\" which has been proven highly effective at making large gains in a small amount of time. We have observed our campers make phenomenal gains in motor skills, language, social skills, and sensory processing. Second, we require the presence of at least one parent or caregiver for each camper, because the camp becomes a parent training, networking, and support system. Parents are trained in effective therapy techniques that can be utilized at home to facilitate the continued advancement of their child's development; also, parents have the opportunity to speak with other parents facing similar issues. Third, but not least, we have student volunteers who assist and gain practical experience in their chosen field of study. This benefits both the child and the student volunteer. Camp ratio is typically 2 to 3 professionals to 1 camper. We can accommodate eight campers. Our program stands above programs, as we have an intense focus on improving foundation skills as opposed to a more cognitive or play model. We utilize a three-hour concentrated activity block of therapy to gain improvements in the neurological system. All camp activities are held out of the doors if the weather allows. All the attributes of the JUMP-IN summer camp make it a unique program. Camp runs from July 17th - July 28th 2023 Sessions are held Monday through Friday mornings from 9:00am to 12:00 noon, Campers activities involve the use of suspended equipment, gross motor activities, fine motor activities , social interaction , brain gym, language, body work, and pool time. A parent/caregiver is expected to stay at camp with the child and participate in activities as needed. Parents tasks include monitoring their child's arousal level and alerting staff to impending melt-downs. Campers new to Jump-In need a evaluation at Jump-In prior to camp. Schedule your evaluation early to begin your home program in boosting nervous system function which will allow your child to receive maximum benefits at camp . Due to the intensity level, campers must be at least 4 years old. There is no upper age limit as all activities are programmed at the individuals level. Please call our office to schedule your spot!
