Questions?Disclosures Dr. Robert Gish is a Medical Consultant for Eiger PharmaceuticalsEpidemiology of Hepatitis Delta Key messages An estimated 15-20 Million individuals are infected with HDV worldwide! Hepatitis Delta is the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis No testing -no identification of HDV infection! The clinical manifestations of hepatitis delta differs between regions and has changed during the last 3 decades Hepatitis Delta is a dynamic disease : -Both HBV and HDV contribute to disease progression Migrant populations and special risks groups show particular high HDV prevalence The HDV genotype matters After: H WedemeyerHDV Significance HDV infection is associated with -Increased liver disease severity in setting of both superinfection and coinfection with HBV -More rapid rates of disease progression and early cirrhosis.

Sherman, MD, PhD Division of Digestive Diseases, University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine -Cincinnati, Ohio. Goals/Hypothesis Determine frequency of testing for HDV among those with HBV infection. Whether HIV -infected persons will have higher rates of testing than those without HIV. Whether Gastroenterologists/ Hepatologists will order HDV tests more frequently than other physician groups. Determine prevalence of HDV among tested HBsAg positive persons. Methods Extracted de -identified data of all subjects with a positive HBsAg in our electronic medical record system (EPIC). Examined characteristics of individuals with and without testing for multiple parameters, including: which the HDV antibody testing was ordered Statistics Parametric and non -parametric comparisons were performed as appropriate to the data using Statistix 10.0. A p-value of 0.05 was considered significant.

Patients with HIV are less likely to have been tested than those without HIV. Gastroenterologist/ Hepatologists are more likely to order HDV testing than other health care providers. The rate of HDV positivity in a mid western city was 3.3% (95% C.I. range 0.9% -8.2%). Conclusions HDV antibody test performance is inadequate in all groups. -Among tested persons, rates of HDV Ab among HBsAg + persons are higher than would be expected. Limitations of the study: -We do not know if the tested group was selected because of higher putative prevalence of HDV. -HDV RNA testing is not available routinely at many institutions, including our own, and should be considered. Targeted reminders may play a role in improving testing performance.Efficacy of prolonged tenofovir therapy on hepatitis delta in HIV -infected patients After tenofovir -RNA less than 10copies/ml .In the last group, the median time to reach undetectable HDV -RNA During tenofovir HDV -RNA .Conclusion: term exposure to tenofovir significantly reduced serum HDV - RNA apart from completely suppressing HBV -DNA in HIV -infected patients with hepatitis delta. This virological benefit is accompanied by significant improvements in liver fibrosis.Functional control and clinical benefit 1 year following completion of REP 2139 / peg -IFN therapy in patients with chronic HBV / HDV co - infection M.

HDV infection can persist in the absence of active cccDNA probably using integrated HBV DNA and mRNA transcripts to make HBsAg Bulk of HBsAg in chronic co -infected patients is derived from integrated HBsAg. REP 2139 simultaneously reduces HBsAg and HDV RNA. HBsAg clearance threshold for activation of immunotherapy appears to be < 1 IU / ml. Functional control of HBV infection in 5/12 patients and control of HDV infection in 7/12 patients is stable 1 year off -treatment. Functional control rate expected to be higher with longer concomitant therapy with REP 2139 and peg -IFN and including TDF.

Volume 15, No. 10 , p1167 -1174, October 2015Conclusions 1 HDV -infection plays an important role in the etiology of liver diseases in various parts of the world All at risk HBsAg -positive patients should be tested for anti -HDV using serology and confirmation with HDV RNA by quant PCR, cirrhosis, geography, risk behavior, abnl ALT on nucsuppressed HBV patients Clinical outcomes of HDV -infection depend on time interval of HBV -and HDV - infections (co -or superinfection), viral and host factors Outcome of CHD superinfection is characterized by rapid progression to cirrhosis, end stage liver disease and HCC Peg-IFN is the only antiviral for the \"treatment\" of CHD, and its efficacy (cure rate) is less than 15 -25% with one year of treatment - Although emerging data in Turkey may show up to a 35 -40% MVR rate with treatment up to 5 years - New reset: HDV RNA suppression by 1 -2 logs off treatment with normal or improved ALT and improved histologyConclusions 2 Prevention HDV = vaccination against HBV and harm reduction HDV LT with CHD is characterized by better outcomes compare to other HBV monoinfection HDV SVR after 48-week dominates over HBV, but in HBV DNA -positive cases providers can use HBV -polymerase inhibitors Combination of PEG IFNa and NAs does not improve treatment results Late HDV RNA relapses may occur after PEG -IFNa therapy of hepatitis delta and thus the term sustained virological response (new term MVR Maintained Virologic Response) should be avoided in HDV infection Treatment up to 5 years would be consider optimal with on treatment monitoring of HDV RNA q until we have new oral/injectable therapies that can clear HBsAg or HDV RNA cureHDV Testing Dr. David HillyardLaboratory Tools for HDV Diagnosis and Monitoring Screen with sensitive antibody assay -IgGand IgM Confirm with sensitive RNA assay -pan-genotypic -calibrated to WHO standard Reflex Antibody to RNA assay streamlines testing Monitor therapeutic response with quantitative RNA assayVirologic and Serologic Markers of HDV Infection Coinfection Immunoassays Siu-Kei et al August 2016 Volume 23 Number 8 Clinical and Vaccine ImmunologyDiasorin research assay is standard of performance (not available for clinical testing) ARUP assay (International Immuno -Diagnostics) And Focus LDT test both performed well, with different cutoffs HDV RNA Testing Confirm serology Provide baseline for monitoring course of treatment Result expressed in international units (I.U.)
