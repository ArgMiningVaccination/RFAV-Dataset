The COVID-19 vaccine medical updates and site training webinars aimto educate providers and immunization staff on the proper use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccines.Dailytraining (Monday through Friday) will begin Monday, June 20, 2022, and continue through July 8, 2022 (with notraining on July 4th).For details, seedates andlinks for upcoming training sessions. COVID-19 eability and V accine Adminis trationVaccine InterchangeabilityCOVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable. The same mRNA vaccine product should be used for all doses of theprimary series. Children ages 6 months-4 years who receive different mRNA products for the first 2 doses of an mRNA COVID-19vaccine series should follow a 3-dose schedule. A third dose of either mRNA vaccine should be administered atleast 8 weeks after the second dose to complete the 3-dose primary series. 10 COVID-19 Vaccine Information BriefJune 20, 2022 Vaccine AdministrationCOVID-19 vaccines may be administered without regard to timing of other vaccines. Extensive experience withnon-COVID 19 vaccines has demonstrated that immunogenicity and adverse event profiles are generally similarwhen vaccines are administered simultaneously as when they are administered alone. In accordance withgeneral best practices, routine administration ofall age appropriate doses of vaccines simultaneously isrecommended for children for whom no specific contraindications exist at the time of the healthcare visit. When deciding whether to coadminister another vaccine(s) with COVID-19 vaccine, providers andparents/guardians may consider: Whether a child is behind or at risk of becoming behind Likelihood of the child returning for another vaccination Their risk of vaccine-preventable diseases The reactogenicity profile of the vaccines Patient and P arent/Guar dian Counseling: Side E ffectsChildren may experience fewer side effects than adolescents or young adults. Local side effects may include: Pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site, Axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy Systemic side effects may include: Fever, fatigue, headache, chills, myalgia, arthralgia Irritability, crying, sleepiness, loss of appetite in infants and younger children Febrile SeizuresFebrile seizures were rare in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials for young children. The impact of coadministrationwith COVID-19 vaccines on risk of febrile seizures has not been specifically studied. Febrile seizures are notuncommon generally and can occur in infants and young children with any condition that causes a fever,including COVID-19. Nearly all children who have a febrile seizure recover quickly and do not have anypermanent neurological damage. CDC will closely monitor for febrile seizures following COVID-19 vaccination inyoung children. 11COVID-19 Vaccine Information BriefJune 20, 2022 COVID-19 Vaccine Administration Errors V-Safe After Vaccination Health CheckerV-safe is a smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to provide personalized healthcheck-ins after an individual receives a COVID-19 vaccination.
