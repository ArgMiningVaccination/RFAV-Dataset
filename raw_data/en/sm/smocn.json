Staff information is needed for daily administrative purposes, for making long -term program an d policy decisions, and for monitoring efforts to improve the education system. Therefore, it is essential that staff information is collected according to established definitions, and updated on a regular basis. This handbook focuses on the importance of consistency in defining and maintaining data at every level of the education system so that such data can be accurately aggregated and analyzed for schools, school districts, and states. In addition to providing data terms and their \"best practice\" definitions, the Handbook offers suggestions about organizing data in a staff accounting system to promote timely and effective use of staff information. This handbook is intended to serve as a reference document for public and private education agencies, schools, early childhood centers, and other education organizations. It may also be useful to researchers; elected officials; and members of the public, including parents and taxpayers interested in information about individuals serving in the United States education system. Use of this handbook will vary from site to site. For example, it could be used to develop or standardize a local school district 's staff accounting system. On the other hand, state education agencies designing and coordinating data collection activities among several state-level agencies might want to select standardized data elements to ensure comparability among agencies. Researchers might refer to the Handbook to identify terminology for designing data collection instruments or studies, and in otherwise working with the education system. Parents and the public may refer to the Handbook to improve their understanding of how staff information may be used. The selection of data terms included in the Handbook reflects the combined best judgment of many individuals as to which staff data are useful in making appropriate, cost -effective, and timely decisions about providing quality educational services in schools and other education agencies. The terms included exemplify the types of information that could be collected about individual staff members and maintained in permanent or temporary personnel records. The Handbook is notmeant to prescribe what data any particular school or agency should collect. No governmental agency requires the use of all of the terms, definitions, and procedures included here; however, care has been taken to make sure that the definitions are consistent with many governmental reporting requirements existing at the time of publication. The reader is invited to view the U.S. Department of Education's web site at http://www.ed.gov for the most current laws and regulations regarding data collections for federal education programs. Uses of Staff Data School or education agency officials often require information about an individual staff member or groups of staff members. For instance, an administrator may need to know about the availability of human resources to initiate a new program. Information about the background, education, and professional qualifications of current staff members could also be used to identify possible candidates to work on the program. Schools, school districts, and state education agencies sometimes are more interested in how groups of teachers are doing than in the performance of individual teachers. For example, a school district might wish to study the relationship between staff development and teacher turnover rate. This type of analysis could be accomplished by using staff records that have had all personally identifiable information removed. Staff information made available to school or agency officials in a standardized format can: Facilitate rational decision making about program development and change Enhance program evaluation by easy cross-tabulation of staff data Facilitate the estimation of future recruitment needs for individual schools and entire school systems Assist in developing sound education policies at all levelsChapter 1 - Introduction 2 Aid in the comparison of information among communities and among states Improve the accuracy and timeliness of nationwide summaries of school staff information Improve the quality and potential impact of data available for education research and evaluation\u2014locally, statewide , and nationwide Enhance reporting to the public about the condition and progress of education Maintaining staff data in a computerized database can facilitate all of the uses described above. Automated data are more easily shared among levels of the education system as needed. Aggregations and analyses can be done with confidence that the data are meaningful if the data elements are consistently defined and maintained within the system. This handbook does not specify which data should be maintained, or who should have access to any collected data. However, it provides guidance on how to maintain data in a computerized database to provide maximum utility and flexibility when making decisions about education staff. Automation of Staff Information With the development of automated, secure management information systems, the ability of education decision makers to use meaningful information has significantly increased. These systems provide for day-to-day administrative needs such as payroll, staffing assignments, and maintenance of licensure records. In addition, automated data systems provide the flexibility to access and analyze data on issues such as supply and demand. Data stored and maintained according to standard formats and definitions can be exchanged with authorized personnel through direct computer- to-computer exchanges via an Intranet or the Internet . However, if the data are to be useful, staff information must be consistently entered into the system and updated continuously. This handbook addresses the issue of consistency in defining and maintaining education staff information. An important concept underlying the use of this book is that data should be collected only once for each staff member rather than collecting the same data multiple times by different offices. Automated information systems allow relevant data elements to be shared among authorized individuals who need the data, even if these individuals work in a different partof the education system. New data need only be entered when there are changes or additions to a staff member's file. To ensure that appropriate and necessary data are maintained in the information system, it is important to consider what questions one might want to address about staffing. Furthermore, data managers may identify opportunities to do analyses by combining staff data with other types of data from within the information system. Carefully designed automated information systems can help increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the education system by allowing access to data by important decision makers. Chapter 3 contains more information about designing such a system. Common Terminology Although the education system in the United States is primarily a local responsibility , with funding, administration, and control coming mostly from the local and state levels, education as a whole is a national issue. The U. S. Department of Education has been involved in activities focused on improving the coordination of its data collection activities. Under its aegis, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES ) has taken the lead in promoting the standardization of data elements and definitions used in education data collection activities, including those relevant to staffing issues. NCES has a mandate to collect \"uniform and comparable data\" in order to report on the condition of education in the United States. To assist in this mandate, NCES has been working with federal, state, and local education agency representatives to develop guidelines for the collection of comparable and complete data, such as those contained in this handbook. Working with the National Forum on Education Statistics (NFES), NCES has produced a number of important documents that are useful for effective decision making about education programs and individual students. These documents are described in the next chapter. By adopting the practices, terminology, definitions, and formats set forth in NCES documents as \"best practice\" for education data collection, local, regional, and national data collectors and users would help ensure the data they use are comparable to those used by others involved in the education system. School leaders could share information more easily because data would be understandable and meaningful to everyone. Superintendent s and principals would communicate better with each other. Chief state school officers would communicate more effectively with their colleagues in other states. AsChapter 1 - Introduction 3the need arises, this common language would also facilitate information exchange between public and private educational systems. Finally, local, regional, and national decision makers in the United States education system would benefit from the flow of more uniform data. As information is aggregated from the lowest level of data maintenance (i.e., a school) to the local education agency, to the state education agency, and, finally, to the national level, program designers andpolicymakers would be able to make decisions based on a more accurate picture of current and projected needs. Conversely, information could then flow back down the education pipeline to lower levels of data maintenance, in a format that is more meaningful and useful in local decision making. In short, the reader is encouraged to use this handbook (and the other related NCES documents) as a tool for making appropriate decisions about the maintenance and use of data about education staff.45Chapter 2 THE HANDBOOK The goal of this handbook is to promote standardized maintenance of accurate and complete data about individual school staff members and others involved in the provision of educational services to children. This handbook identifies terms that can be used to describe the background, qualifications , responsibilities, and performance of different types of educators and support staff, including teachers, administrators, support service staff, contractors, and volunteers. The Handbook contains a set of terms and definitions that can be used at all levels of the education system, including early childhood education centers and elementary and secondary schools and districts; in all types of education organizations, including public schools, private schools, and schools run by private management companies; and by district, diocesan, regional, state, and federal education agencies. If staff data are collected and maintained according to standard definitions at the lowest level (the school or school district ), data can be aggregated more easily to higher levels with the assurance that the data are comparable from individual to individual, from site to site, and from year to year. This will aid in looking at patterns of staffing over time and predicting staffing needs in the future. Background information is usually collected when an individual is hired for the first time by a school, a school district , or other education organization. Much of this information (such as date and place of birth) will not change over the course of the staff member's career. This type of information should only be collected once, and it should become a part of the individual's permanent record. Additional paperwork should be necessary only if a change occurs (for example, a home address may change). Other types of information accumulate and change over the course of a staff member's career and need to be added to the record as appropriate. This type of information might include assignments, career development, and salary increases. For the purpose of this handbook, a \"staff member\" is defined as an individual who performs specified activities for any public or private education institution or agency that provides instructional or support services to students or staff, at the early childhood through high school completion levels. A staff member may be: An \"employee\" who performs services under the direction of the employing institution or agency, is compensated for such services by the employer, and is eligible for employee benefits and wage or salary tax withholdings A \"contractor \" or \"consultant \" who performs services for an agreed -upon fee, or an employee of a management service contracted to work on site A \"volunteer\" who performs services on a voluntary and unpaid basis An in-kind service provider whose salary and/or expenses are paid by someone else, such as services provided by a partner or organization. An independent businessperson or contractor working at a school site Purposes and Scope of the Handbook The purposes of this handbook are to: 1. Provide a common language that can be used to collect accurate, consistent, comparable, and complete data on staff. 2. Promote the development of policies to safeguard the confidentiality of the data and ensure appropriate use of staff data. 3. Describe how all relevant parties can maintain data in a way that promotes flexible and efficient use. This handbook includes terms, and their definitions that can be used to collect and maintain information about individuals serving in the following types of organizations: Public and private education institutions and programs, including early childhood or pre-kindergarten programs; elementary, middle or junior high, and high schools; vocational -technical programs; special education programs; and adult high schools All types of education organizations, including schools, school districts/local education agencies, intermediate education units, education service districts, and state and federal education agenciesChapter 2 - The Handbook 6 This handbook does not describe a mandated data collection system or instrument; rather, it encourages the standardization of terminology use across all levels. Although the Handbook covers information related to individuals serving through the secondary education level only, many of the terms may be applied and used interchangeably with postsecondary education. For example, terms describing personal identification, educational background, or certain employment conditions could be used to maintain information about individuals (both staff and students) at various education levels. The data elements and definitions contained in the Handbook are relevant to any staff record whether or not it is a part of a computerized database. The data elements can be used to standardize how information is collected on paper documents, as well. This handbook, however, has been organized to facilitate the design and development of an automated staff accounting system because of the maintenance and communication advantages associated with such a system. Common Terms and Definitions Many different types of decisions are made by, and about staff members; consequently, many different types of data are needed. For example, education organizations must be able to prove that employees meet the requirements for the positions they hold. Certain types of standard employment information must be maintained to meet reporting requirements of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Social Security Administration (SSA), and other governmental agencies. Education organizations must have information for payroll and other necessary administrative functions; they also maintain information about staff assignments and performance. This handbook identifies types of data that are needed by education organizations both for general recordkeeping and for making decisions about effective staffing arrangements. The selection of specific data elements to be maintained is often facilitated by the choice of an automated staff information system. Most staffing software packages are designed to maintain the data elements required for federal reporting, payroll, salary, and benefits. These are needed by all businesses, not just education. The maintenance of data about educational background, assignment, evaluation, and professional development may not, however, be consistent among software packages; in addition, they may not be particularly attuned to the needs of education organizations. This handbook contains a comprehensive listing of data elementsimportant to the education system, reflecting the needs of all types of education organizations. Within software systems, or on paper data collection forms, the potential exists for data to be maintained in a variety of formats. As people fill out forms, they may interpret questions in different ways than originally intended. For each of the data elements in this handbook, therefore, a standard definition is included, and for many data elements there are lists of unique options. The value of clearly defining how data are collected and maintained cannot be overstated. When staff data are collected and maintained consistently and accurately, the data aggregated from schools and districts will be comparable. This will make the resulting information more useful for evaluation and decision making purposes. Safeguarding Confidentiality and Ensuring Appropriate Use of Staff Data Education organizations must develop policies and procedures for collecting, maintaining, using, and disposing of staff data that are appropriate for local and state needs, and conform with applicable laws and regulations . Many parts of staff records are considered \"public records,\" subject to federal and state open records laws or the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA ). As a result, education organizations must establish policies and procedures for making data available to the public upon request. At the same time, each education agency should be sensitive to the privacy rights of their staff, and have policies and procedures that protect against improper use of information about individual staff members. The National Forum on Education Statistics and NCES have released a document called Privacy Issues in Education Staff Records (NCES 2000-363) to help education organizations with the appropriate use and confidential maintenance of staff data. In addition, NCES has produced a document on the security of technology systems as it relates to the maintenance of administrative records systems, called Safeguarding Your Technology (NCES 98- 297). Both documents are described later in this chapter. Development of Automated Staff Data Systems Increasing numbers of education organizations are computerizing their staff records because of the many advantages of automation. Typical software packages handle payroll data, scheduling, and other necessary administrative tasks. In addition, mostChapter 2 - The Handbook 7automated staff information systems offer flexibility in how data can be used within the educationorganization. For instance, by using informationfrom an automated staff data system that is integratedwith other data systems (e.g., finance, students, facilities), administrators can analyze and evaluate a number of factors that can affect the quality ofeducational services provided. Administrators couldlook at the educational background of the teachingstaff, check on the availability of appropriatelytrained staff, identify teachers who are doing anoutstanding job of instructing students, and predictwhere staffing shortages will occur. Such analysescan promote more efficient and effective decisionmaking by administrators. This handbook is not meant to provide a design for an automated staff accounting system. Indeed, the data elements included can be used in paper as wellas computer records. This handbook does, however,provide a design for coding data so that they can bestored and flexibly used in a managementinformation system. In addition, when staffinformation needs to be shared within the educationorganization, or with other agencies andorganizations, it can be done more efficiently and, insome cases, more accurately if the data aremaintained in an automated system. Automated systems also offer the capacity to protect the confidentiality of individual records by making dataavailable only to those with a clear need to haveaccess. Background of the Handbook This handbook is one of a series of handbooks thatprovide guidance to education organizations onvarious different types of education data. Thisedition was developed with the assistance of many representatives of federal, state and local education agencies over the course of a year . The terms, definitions, and procedures recommended representthe combined best judgment of many expertsparticipating in the cooperative development of thehandbook series. They are presented as soundpractices or principles to be interpreted and appliedaccording to the identified needs and requirements ofany education organization. NCES Handbooks and Other Guides NCES has sponsored the revision of several handbooks that were a part of a series of terminologymanuals called the State Educational Records and Reports Series , originally published between 1953 and 1974. These handbooks provide essentialguidance about the importance of comparable andcomplete data collected by school districts and stateeducation agencies including data reported to thefederal government each year . The handbooks reflect the growing importance of consolidated educationdata systems that allow different types of information to be brought together to improve education decision making. Last published in 1995, the Staff Data Handbook: Elementary, Secondary and Early Childhood Education is a revision of the document Staff Accounting : Classifications and Standard Terminology for Local and StateSchool Systems (Handbook IV), originally published in 1965. Much of the earlierinformation has been included here; howevermany new data elements have been added, reflecting increased accountability requirements, new types of professional development, andpayroll information. A new version of the Student Data Handbook: Elementary, Secondary and Early ChildhoodEducation (NCES 2000-343) 1 was published in 2000. Previously called Handbook V , Standard Terminology and Guide for Managing StudentData in Elementary and Secondary Schools,Community /Junior Colleges , and Adult Education , this handbook was originally published in 1974 and revised in 1994, when itstitle was changed. This handbook provides acomprehensive listing of data elements thatcould be collected about students in schools, districts, or state education agencies. Many of the data elements are identical to the ones in theStaff Data Handbook . Appendix C lists the numbers of the identical data elements. Another handbook in the series is Financial Accounting for Local and State School Systems (Handbook II) (NCES 97-096R) 2, last revised in 1990. Another revision is under way. Thishandbook covers basic concepts for financialmanagement, which is relevant to staff databecause, among other reasons, effective use offinancial and human resources is essential torunning education organizations. Since 1995, NCES has published several other documents that support the automation andstandardization of data collection. Based on discussions related to the Student Data Handbook and the SPEEDE/ExPRESS student transcript format (described in more detail later 1http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2000/studenthb 2http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=97096RChapter 2 - The Handbook 8in this chapter), a need for a standard course classification system was identified. To meet thisneed, in 1995 NCES published A Pilot Standard National Course Classification System for Secondary Education (NCES 95-480) 3. Plans are under discussion to revise this document oncethe new student and staff data handbooks arecomplete. This handbook provides codes to linkstudent and staff data, which can help educationorganizations answer questions about theprovision of comparable courses across andwithin states. These codes can also be used toanalyze teacher qualifications for particular courses. In June 1997, the National Forum on EducationStatistics published Basic Data Elements for Elementary and Secondary EducationInformation Systems (NCES 97-531) 4. This document describes the data element building blocks for an education information system.Based on the contents of the Student Data Handbook and the Staff Data Handbook, thisdocument provides guidance to education staffresponsible for developing a flexible and usefuldata system. Protecting the Privacy of Student Records: Guidelines for Education Agencies (NCES 97- 527) 5, written for the National Forum on Education Statistics and NCES , provides guidance regarding the safety and security of student records. This document focuses onpractical procedures and policies to support strictcontrol and appropriate release of studentrecords, an issue that raised concerns during thedevelopment of the Student Data Handbook . Technology @ Your Fingertips (NCES 98-293) 6 was developed by NCES to provide guidance on the selection and implementation ofadministrative and instructional technology.This document contains guidelines, checklists,and case studies to help schools, districts, stateeducation agencies, and postsecondary educationinstitutions make effective technology decisions. Another document, Safeguarding Your Technology (NCES 98-297) 7, focuses on technology equipment security, which is essential when maintaining automated records. Like Technology @ Your Fingertips , this 3http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=95480 4http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=97531 5 http://nces.ed.gov/pubs97/P97527 6 http://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/tech 7 http://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/safetechdocument includes guidelines, checklists, and case studies to assist staff from schools, districts,and state education agencies; and othersresponsible for planning, designing, andmaintaining technology. Privacy Issues in Education Staff Records(NCES 2000-324) 8 discusses key concepts in protecting and managing staff records. It doesnot provide legal guidelines, but does addressrequirements of the federal Freedom ofInformation and Privacy Acts; and it offersprinciples of best practice. Building an Automated Student Record System(NCES 2000-324) 9 is a guide for local and state education agencies designing or upgrading anautomated student information system.Guidelines, checklists, and real-life examples areincluded. NCES also has participated in the development of formats for electronic record exchange of student andstaff records through the American NationalStandards Institute's Electronic Data Interchange(EDI) subcommittee. The student record format is called SPEEDE/ExPRESS . SPEEDE stands for Standardization of Postsecondary Education Electronic Data Exchange, and ExPRESS stands for Exchange of Permanent Records Electronically forStudents and Schools. (A personnel record format iscurrently under development.) Information on theeducation EDI standards can be obtained at http://www.standardscouncil.org . Handbook Revision Process Beginning in 1998, the Administrative RecordsDevelopment Project of the Council of Chief StateSchool Officers (CCSSO), under contract to NCES and with the assistance of Evaluation Software Publishing, Inc. as subcontractors, began anew theprocess of revising and updating the student and staffdata handbooks. As before, recommendations weresought from local, state, and federal education agencystaff concerning needed changes and proposed newdata elements. A working group was convened inMarch 2000 to review potential revisions and make additional suggestions. In addition, a federal working group consisting of individuals from the U.S.Department of Education was convened in May 2000to provide input on changes in federal reportingrequirements. Potential revisions were shared withmany groups of education representatives, as well aswith individuals who volunteered to review the new 8http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2000363 9http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2000324Chapter 2 - The Handbook 9edition. Those who participated in the revision of this handbook are named in appendix A. Final revisions were submitted to NCES in Fall 2000, for publication in early 2001. A new process for continually revising the Handbook is described in detail later in this chapter. Annual changes will be finalized in January of each year and published on the NCES Web page. In addition, revised pages will be printed to accompany the printed document. Electronic Handbook A Web-based version of this handbook is available at http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2001/staffhb . The online version of the Staff Data Handbook was created to allow a more \"interactive\" way to use the contents . A \"List of Staff Data Elements\" and an \"Alphabetical Subject Area Index\" allow the reader to move around to the data elements of interest. The online version also includes some direct links to references, which allows for updated information. The data element content is the same as in the currently available printed version. The chapters of the printed version are also included, and the on-screen \"Table of Contents\" can be used to review them. The electronic Handbook can be viewed through most browsers, and can be easily downloaded to the reader's printer or desktop. Criteria for Including Items in the Handbook Three basic criteria\u2014data usefulness, effort to collect, and reporting requirements\u2014were used in selecting data elements. Each data element included was judged according to the following criteria: 1. The data element is important and needed by many schools, school districts, or state education agencies to maintain vital information about staff background, qualifications , assignments, and evaluations. 2. The effort involved in accurately collecting and maintaining the data element is justifiable in terms of the value of the information. 3. The data element is needed for reporting information about staff to school districts or other administrative units, to state education agencies, to the federal government, and/or to parents or other constituencies in the community. These or similar criteria may be helpful to state and local agencies and other education organizations, both public and private, in selecting items from this handbook.One type of information that was considered but not included is a listing of references to federal surveys. Most federal education surveys ask that schools, school districts, or state education agencies report aggregate information about staff. However, a few federal sample surveys collect information about individual staff members. A listing of which individual staff-level data elements are collected in these federal surveys was omitted for two reasons. One is that the levels (staff, school, school district , and state) at which the information is collected varies from survey to survey, and it would be difficult to ensure a clear distinction of the appropriate level for each data element . A second reason is that this handbook is meant to represent \"best practice\" that is not expected to change for many years, while federal surveys can change from year to year or even between cycles. Data collectors, data users, and the public may, nevertheless, need to know which data specific surveys collect. Plans are underway to develop lists of these data elements in an electronic format through the United States Department of Education's electronic network. Sources of Definitions The definitions included for categories, data elements, options, and entities were taken primarily from existing sources; others were written with the assistance of participants in the development process. In some instances, laws or federal regulations specified what data elements should be used and how they should be defined. Some of the definitions were included in the previous Handbook and are still in common usage. Other definitions came from a variety of published sources, such as textbooks, federal publications, or other documents. For certain elements, comparisons were made among various local, state and federal sources, and a compromise definition was developed. Most of the options lists were drawn from existing sources. Some were obtained through the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), others were included in the Student Data Handbook. Basic Definitions Several terms are used throughout this handbook. These terms are defined here to ensure clarity when reviewing the rest of the document. A staff member is defined here as an individual who performs specified activities for any public or private education institution or agency that provides instructional or support services to students or staff in an early childhood, elementary, or secondary educational program. Included are individuals suchChapter 2 - The Handbook 10as teachers; school and district administrators; special service providers; and other types of support staff, such as school bus drivers, cafeteria workers, security guards, and custodians. The term school system is used to represent the education system as a whole, including schools, school districts and other local administrative units (such as dioceses) intermediate agencies (such as regional service centers), state education agencies, and the U.S. Department of Education. Both public and private schools are included, as are administrative agencies. The term's local education agency, local administrative unit , and school district refer to education institutions, agencies, and administrative units that exist primarily to operate schools or to contract for educational services. These units need not be coextensive with county, city, or town boundaries. They oversee the functioning of schools within specific boundaries or jurisdictions, and have instructional, administrative, and recordkeeping responsibility for students. The term education organization is used to describe any or all types of public or private education agencies, institutions, or other entities that maintain data about individuals employed in education (e.g., retirement systems, licensure commissions). The term school is used to refer to any institution that provides preschool, elementary, and/or secondary instruction. This would include an early childhood center or preschool, a public or private school serving children in kindergarten through grade 12 (and even grade 13), a vocational or adult high school, and a school that is classified as ungraded. These schools have one or more teachers to give instruction or care, are located in one or more buildings, and have an assigned administrator. The term researchers is used to describe those responsible for evaluating education programs, individuals conducting research activities about the status of schools and students, and others with analytical responsibilities\u2014regardless of who is sponsoring the activities. The term's data and information are used extensively through this handbook. Data are the raw facts about a person or other entity, such as the birthdate, a mark of \"A\" in a history course, or a residence address of \"1234 Main Street.\" Information is compiled, combined, summarized, or reported data that, in context, has a significant meaning. For example, a teacher's education background and previous experience can be used as information to determine what teaching assignment they should have or the total number of teachers with licensure for thecourses they teach can be derived from an individual staff accounting system. Chapter 4 contains terms and definitions for two levels of data maintenance: entities and data elements. In this handbook, an entity is a person, place, event, object, or concept about which data can be collected. A data element is a specific bit of data that can be defined and measured. When entities and data elements are combined, new unique data elements are created. For instance, the data element \"Name of Institution \" is defined each time it appears, but the corresponding entity is different for each appearance (e.g., Education Institution , Credentialing Organization , or Employer ). Data elements have been arranged into categories or groups of related data elements. For example, the category \"Background Information \" includes personal information about an individual, including data elements such as \"Social Security Number ,\" \"Race,\" \"Ethnicity,\" \"Sex ,\" \"Birthdate \"Language.\" For many data elements, a free-form (open-ended) description is the appropriate response when designing a data collection instrument or system. For example, the possible responses for the data element \"Name of Institution \" are too numerous to list and must be keyed in by the user. However, many data elements in this handbook contain options. Options are possible alternatives or coded responses for data elements. Whenever possible, this handbook attempts to include an exhaustive and mutually exclusive list of options. For example, the data element \"Sex\" lists two options: \"Male \" and \"Female .\" In this revised version, however, new code lists have been added that may not be comprehensive. The revision process described earlier in this chapter will allow additional options to be added as necessary or appropriate. The options presented for each data element are generally illustrative, not mandatory. Education organizations may adjust, adapt, or replace them as needed to meet their requirements. In addition, schools and school districts may wish to create an options list for data elements if no list is included in this handbook. A subset of options might, in some instances, be sufficient when designing a data system or data collection instrument. Ideally, any modification should be done in such a way that it does not conflict with the basic handbook structure. In some instances, code lists are available from other sources and are referenced for a data element . For some data elements, a more extensive list of options might be needed and obtained from another source.Chapter 2 - The Handbook 11There are some instances where laws or regulations specify the options listed for some data elements. For example, some options are required for federal reporting to the Office of Special Education Programs of the U.S. Department of Education. Schools or school districts may also need to adjust their option lists to reflect the current reporting requirements as specified by revised law and regulations. Care should be taken in combining categories and data elements in individual records to ensure that data can be compared or aggregated with data or information from other sources. In some cases, examples of options are listed within a data element definition, but a comprehensive list is not included because major variations are possible due to local options or expectations. When a comprehensive list could not be developed, examples were included with the definition. At the time of this handbook's revision, changes were being made to the way information about how the \"Racial/Ethnic Group\" elements will be reported to the federal government. This will obviously affect how information must be maintained by schools, districts, and states. Previously, there were five options for \"Racial/Ethnic Group\" used in education organizations: \"American Indian Hispanic),\" \"Hispanic,\" and \"White (not Hispanic).\" Each staff member was identified by one of these five options. Recent work completed by the federal Office of Management and Budget requires that information about five categories of race, in addition to Hispanic ethnicity, must be recorded for all persons. Specifically, staff members should be allowed to indicate if they consider themselves to be any one or more of the following: \"American Indian or Alaska Native,\" \"Asian ,\" \"Black or African American ,\" \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander ,\" or \"White.\" As a result, there will be major changes in how race and ethnicity information may be reported and maintained. The U.S. Department of Education has not made its final recommendations on how aggregated data should be reported. For example, tabulation guidelines may allow some of the 63 possible combinations of race and ethnicity to be collapsed into broader categories. The Department of Education intends to allow education organizations three years to implement the guidelines for aggregating and reporting data, once these are established. Data for individuals, however, will be reported by the Department following the schedule set by OMB (January 2003). Maintenance at the school district level of complete information will beneeded, therefore, to meet whatever requirements are eventually identified. While schools or school districts may wish to allow other more specific options than those included in the Handbook, new options should be designed in such a way that they can later be re-grouped or collapsed into the options included here, or as required by current law. (See appendix D for further explanation of Directive 15 and OMB 's work.) In chapter 5, entities and data elements are combined to describe how this handbook may be used to set up a staff accounting system. This chapter also provides suggested data element types and field lengths for readers creating an automated staff accounting system. In some cases, an assumption was made that coded options would be used instead of an open- ended response. However, the reader may choose not to use the suggested options. Contents of the Handbook This handbook contains both general information about data collection activities and individual staff accounting systems, and specific information about what might be included in a staff record . Chapter 1, \"Introduction,\" provides an introduction to the Handbook and discusses the need for a common language and the potential technology offers in maximizing the usefulness of information obtained by education data collection efforts. Chapter 2, \"The Handbook,\" describes the purposes and the role of the Handbook, its contents and potential uses, and recognized limitations. Listings of other related documents that could be useful are also included. In anticipation of future updates, a description of the process for implementing suggested changes has been included. Chapter 3, \"Building an Automated Staff Accounting System,\" describes a process for developing a staff accounting system, and the principles related to the development of such a system. Included are suggestions for policy development regarding the design of a staff accounting system, the kinds of data that should be collected, the updating of these data, the uses of the data, and the need to control access to individual staff records. Chapter 4, \"Definition of Terms,\" contains a comprehensive listing of data terms considered important to the management of schools, the appropriate assignment of personnel, and the provision of services and benefits to staff. Each entity listed refers to something, or someone, about which data should be maintained. Each data element refers to a particular aspect of staff data for which some need was perceived within the school system .Chapter 2 - The Handbook 12A \"best practice\" definition is included for each entity and data element . A data element 's definition may include options or classifications that describe the term, and which can be used as codes within a staff accounting system. In addition, potential entity uses are listed for each data element . Chapter 5, \"Applications of the Handbook,\" is, for the most part, dedicated to the design of a potential staff accounting system that joins entities with data elements to describe how data could be maintained. A table is also provided with information about data element type and field length , attributes that could be useful to readers designing a data collection system, a survey, or a reporting format. The glossary defines selected staff-related terms that are used in the text, but not defined in earlier chapters, as well as other important terms in staff data management. A detailed Index is also includedfor easy reference. Following the Glossary and Index are 13 appendices with important supplemental information. The appendices include comprehensive lists of coding options for some of the data elements in chapter 4. Included are code designations for states and outlying areas , countries, languages, occupational groupings, medical conditions and treatments, and listings of federal education programs and the names of those who contributed to the development of this revision. Users of the 1995 version of the Staff Data Handbook should note that Section B, Educational Background, and Section C, Professional Development, have been combined. Updates to the Handbook Beginning with the revised version of this handbook, NCES has instituted a process for revising the Handbook on an as-needed basis. The expectation is that major revisions suggested in the four to five years following publication will be minimal, and a complete revision will not be needed for five or more years. To handle minor revisions or additions as they arise, the following procedures have been developed. In order to identify needed changes or additions, NCES will compile suggestions and questions sent by letter or e- mail over the course of a year. In addition, the U.S. Department of Education staff will be contacted to determine if there are changes in reporting requirements that affect the handbook data elements. Suggestions and questions will be posted on the National Forum on Education Statistics listserv around December 1, at least two months before the Forum's Winter meeting. At the Winter meeting, a group of Forum members will consider the proposed changes and decide which to include in the new revision. Once the changes have been determined, the Government Printing Office will be provided substitute pages for inclusion with the printed version. Changes and revised pages will also be made available electronically on the Handbook Homepage. Visitors to the site should be able to print the revised pages as they look in the printed document. In this and subsequent versions of the Handbook, readers will be encouraged to visit the NCES web site at http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2001/staffhb to obtain any recent revisions. Suggestions for revisions can be submitted to NCES in the following ways: 1. Go to the Handbook web site ( http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2001/staffhb ) and follow the e-mail link for submitting changes. 2.

For example, a file is created as soon as a teacher applies for certification or licensure from a state licensing agency. Such a file generally lists completed coursework, including apprenticeships or student teaching, and recommendations for certification/licensure. As a part of the hiring process, the local administrative unit may request information about the applicant's background, such as home address, social security number, license, content areas of certification, experience, and other basic information. When the individual is assigned to a school, other information about that assignment, such as grade levels, courses taught, and school location is added to the record. In addition, the payroll office keeps information about the staff member's insurance plan(s), beneficiary, withholding requirements, and other data that are needed to ensure the staff member is paid and taxes and insurance are covered. Other information about the staff member might be kept at the assignment site, including an Emergency Contact name, extracurricular sponsorships, attendance, and appraisal ratings. Retirement systems for the state or school district also maintain files that might include the staff member's expected date of retirement, years of experience, and other related information. Although the exact content may differ, the types of data files mentioned above are generally kept for both teaching and non -teaching staff, including both licensed and unlicensed personnel. Efficiency suggests that relevant information should be collected once and subsequently made available to all authorized users through an automated, distributed database arrangement or a consolidated computer database. For example, a staff member's address should be entered once into the system, and then accessed by anyone within the organization with a need to mail something to the staff member. Using standard terminology when developing a database can ensure that information will be correctly interpreted and useful. Staff records serve many purposes; but whatever their content, use, or storage medium, a staff record is basically a collection of information about a staff member.A well-designed, automated staff accounting system yields many benefits, including the ability to extract information about individual staff members, schools, programs, and school systems for use in decision making. A second benefit may occur when staff records are added to an overall management information system that includes data about students, facilities, resources, curriculum materials, and budgeting for the school or school district . Ease of use means that authorized personnel can accomplish management activities more efficiently, especially if the data are comparable. In such an arrangement, staff accounting systems can play a key role in the overall functioning of the school system . In addition, such a system allows for more sophisticated analyses to be conducted, promoting improvement in the way instructional and other types of services are provided to students. With the growing number of schools and local education agencies, including those administered by private management companies, it is increasingly important to develop well -designed mechanisms for collecting accurate and timely information that can be used for policymaking. Many state education agencies are beginning to collect more information about educators currently employed in school districts across the state. In conjunction with student and finance data provided by schools and districts, this staffing information can be used to evaluate the quality of the provided instruction, and to hold schools and districts accountable for student learning. As a result, a more efficient way is needed to move data from schools and districts to state education agencies, so as to make the data readily available for state-level policymaking. If the data are to be useful, standard definitions for data elements are essential. Description of a Staff Record A staff record is, by definition, any recorded information about a staff member. Staff records can be described in terms of content (e.g., assignment information), use (e.g., ensuring that staff hold any required credentials ), or by how they are stored (e.g., a computer disk). Staff records may be used for many purposes, including monitoring compliance with state laws and regulations ; identifying staffing needs; scheduling teachers into classes; producingChapter 3- Building A Staff Accounting System 14paychecks; and completing reports for local, state, and federal authorities. A staff record may be kept on file in a state education agency, a school district office, a school office, or another approved location. The record contains information collected from the staff member; from supervisor s; and from other sources outside the school, such as Postsecondary institutions the staff member attended. A complete staff record may be a single file, or it may be made up of several separate records, each with specific contents or use, and each stored in a different way. It may be stored in a central location (such as a school district computer) for the convenience of authorized individuals requiring access to information contained in the record, or it can be stored as separate information by each office that uses the record. No matter where the record is stored, however, procedures must be in place to ensure that access is only granted to authorized individuals, and that it is updated as needed in a timely fashion. Description of a Staff Accounting System Separate staff records become a staff accounting system when they are linked together or made accessible for one of several critical functions, such as generating reports, adding/deleting/modifying records, and conducting analyses. Staff accounting systems, like records, may be maintained as paper files, on microfilm, in computer files, or in some combination. To improve efficiency and data usefulness, many school districts and state education agencies have entered their staff records into computerized databases. As mentioned above, computer systems offer tremendous advantages over the traditional paper systems; however, most computerized systems still require paper records at various stages of implementation. Numerous companies have developed software products designed to store and process staff records. Some school districts use personnel system software developed to be applicable for all types of businesses.Others use software products developed specifically for education organizations, which provide applications for course scheduling and other education-specific activities, as well as linkages with other software such as student information products. Still other districts have software developed internally by staff or consultants. Using generic and education-specific products together (for example, specialized student records systems and a generic business accounting package) can sometimes be difficult, but it is possible. There are ways to ensure that essential information can be extracted and combined with other data for analytical purposes. Each education organization seeking to automate its staffing records, or to update an existing system, must determine the best system design and software solution for its unique needs. An important consideration will be maintaining the system as changes or improvements are needed, as well as the resources needed to keep the system working on a daily basis. The following information will help readers identify and implement the most appropriate automated system for their organizations. Benefits of a Well -Designed Staff Accounting System A well-designed, comprehensive, and com puterized staff accounting system offers many benefits. Some of the most important advantages are discussed below. Ease in getting the required information Similar to an office's filing system, the adequacy of a staff accounting system is often judged by how much time and effort are required to find and retrieve information. An effective staff accounting system is thus designed to provide the required information upon request, easily and without burdensome trial- and-error searching. Therefore, a key part of the system's design should be the processes for access, retrieval, and reporting. Ideally, the queries that will be needed are anticipated and accommodated when the system is designed. For example, standard reports may be produced automatically and consistently on a predetermined schedule. The Schools Interoperability Framework (SIF) is a computer industry initiative to develop specifications to ensure that K-12 instructional and administrative software applications work together more effectively. These specifications deal with the way information is stored, accessed, updated, and transferred. Among the types of software included are student information services, food services, grade book, human resources, financial management, instructional management, library automation, and transportation. SIF will enable diverse applications to interact and share data efficiently, reliably and securely, regardless of the host platform. For additional information, visit http://www.sifinfo.org .Chapter 3- Building A Staff Accounting System 15 Accuracy Data quality and accuracy are basic to a well- designed staff accounting system. However, a record system can be no more accurate than the data in it. Traditionally, paper records are not easily kept complete and up-to-date, nor are they readily accessible. While the use of a computer system in maintaining staff records helps to maximize accuracyby providing formatting parameters, database structures, and codes, technology is by no means a guarantee of quality. However, once data are collected according to appropriate collection standards (see information on SEDCAR later in this chapter) and standard data definitions (such as appear in this handbook), computers can facilitate efforts to maintain data quality during information sharing, analyzing, and reporting. Data accuracy should be ensured from original collection, to data entry, to maintenance. Such accuracy provides users the confidence necessary to rely on their system. Quicker response When information from a staff record is needed, it is often needed promptly. For example, when a staff member moves from one assignment to another, the staff record needs to reflect this change in a timely fashion. A well -designed staff record system makes access to, and modification of, records easy and timely. In addition, analyses of data in the system can be completed more efficiently to meet the needs of decision makers. Cost savings A well-conceived and implemented staff accounting system can reduce the costs of handling the paperwork associated with recordkeeping and report production. While automation of staff records seems to provide the most efficiency, a common mistake made when automating a paper system is a failure to completely redesign the system to take advantage of the computer's capabilities. While initial costs may be high for developing a computerized data system, they can often be justified through future savings, increased access, and greater efficiency. Moving data to different education agencies A well-designed automated staff accounting system allows for the easy and efficient movement of staff records among different levels of the education system. For instance, information on teacher licensure can be transmitted electronically to school districts seeking to hire an educator. Similarly, when a school employee retires, data can be efficiently transferred to the retirement system. Effective Uses of Staffing Data Identifying data elements for inclusion in a staff accounting system is a very important step in designing a system; this will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter. It is important to identifythe data elements essential to the functioning of the education system, and to make plans to collect and maintain those data. An important role of a staff accounting system is to provide administrators with the information they need to ensure that appropriate staff members have been assigned, and that the staff is functioning at the highest level possible. Data elements should be selected for any of the following reasons: 1. The data are needed for administrative purposes to ensure an efficient education system. 2. The data are needed for reporting to school boards, state boards of education, and state and federal education agencies. 3. The data are needed to evaluate the quality of the instruction and services being provided. Many state education agencies collect individual staff records and handle some of these needs at the state level. This reduces the burden on the districts, and also provides a database more useful for state-level analyses. Readers selecting the content of a staff accounting system must remember that data should not be collected if they are not needed or if their accuracy is suspect. In particular, sensitive data should not be maintained unless an important purpose is being served, particularly if the information can be requested through the state's Open Records Act or Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Many ethical issues should be considered in conjunction with the collection and use of staffing data. Therefore, when selecting data elements for inclusion in a staff accounting system, it is vital to first consider how the data are supposed to be used as well as how they could be used. Best Practice\u2014 SEDCAR Guidelines are available that describe \"best practice\" in collecting and reporting education data, including staff information. Called the Standards for Education Data Collection and Reporting (SEDCAR ), these guidelines were developedChapter 3- Building A Staff Accounting System 16pursuant to the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments of 1988, which authorized an effort to improve the comparability, quality, and usefulness of education data. SEDCAR is a helpful guide to basic principles for ensuring good quality in the key phases of data collection, storage, and reporting. Anyone developing, redesigning, or taking charge of a staff accounting system can benefit from the collective experience of the large team of professionals brought together to develop SEDCAR . Design of a Staff Accounting System A process for designing or redesigning a staff accounting system is described in the following ten steps. As with most systems, these steps and their associated issues are never finally resolved; rather, the design is ongoing and builds upon itself. However, the standards and principles on which the system is designed need to be continually monitored, and revised as needed. Step 1 - Identify the possible uses of the system. The first step is to identify, describe, and agree upon the potential uses for an automated staff accounting system. These identified uses will determine the response to each of the next nine steps. The information in a staff record may have multiple uses. For example, within a state education agency, the certification/licensing office maintains files on each person licensed or certified as an educator in the state. These files contain transcripts, references, health information , criminal checks, and other evaluation materials. In some state education agencies, there may also be information on a staff member's current and past assignments and other relevant information, such as professional development activities. Often, a state education agency or other state department maintains staff records containing information for the retirement system. Within a school district , the personnel office uses staff records to store information about applicants, and to ensure that all requirements are met for employment. This information becomes a part of the permanent record when the person is hired. District accounting offices use staff records to ensure that paychecks are appropriately distributed and to record information about fringe benefits received by staff members. Schools maintain information about staff members' schedules, attendance, and evaluation, but they may also need certification or licensure information. Finally, schools, districts, and state education agencies use these files to report certain types of aggregate data to school boards, state education agencies and the public.The deliberative process should include representatives from the offices of personnel, payroll, research/evaluation, and other areas with a need for staff information. Step 2 - Establish written policies and guidelines to ensure laws and regulations are enforced. The system must be designed to comply with any regulations governing any of the identified uses. Such regulations may mandate the response to any or all of the following eight steps. To ensure that legal requirements are met and ethical responsibilities carried out appropriately and effectively, education organizations are advised to establish their own written policies and guidelines for maintaining privacy and confidentiality of staff records. Before doing so, it will be necessary to compile and review local, state, and federal laws, existing administrative policies, union agreements, professional standards, and other relevant considerations particular to an agency or institution. Policies and guidelines should state principles and procedures regarding: Selecting appropriate data elements for staff records Collecting data elements accurately, consistently, and carefully Maintaining relevant, accurate, and confidential records Determining which organizations and individuals should be authorized to collect, maintain, and gain access to the system Carefully screening anyone who will handle confidential information Restricting access to records by unauthorized school personnel Safeguarding data (or restricting access) in the possession of a contracting organization Safeguarding individual staff records being transferred to other schools or school systems, state education agencies, and elsewhere Concealing the identity of individuals or institutions entitled to confidentiality, using appropriate procedures for aggregating, encoding, and releasing sensitive data Destroying records or data no longer needed Education organizations may want to establish and maintain a committee to review policies, procedures, and activities involving staff records. The membership of this review committee might include representatives of various groups such as teachers, principals, non -certificated staff, personnel directors, accounting managers, and union representatives.Chapter 3- Building A Staff Accounting System 17This committee should be responsible for ensuring that staff data are collected, stored, accessed, used, and discarded in such a way that the rights and welfare of staff members are protected. Every education organization should periodically reassure itself, through appropriate administrative review, that its policies and procedures for protecting staff rights and welfare are being applied effectively. Organizations should also accept or delegate responsibility for continually monitoring local, state, and federal legislatures and other agencies authorized to enact new or modify regulations relevant to implementing a staff accounting system. Step 3 - Determine the system contents . Both the identified uses and regulations determine the contents of a staff accounting system. Contents are the information areas or categories to be kept or excluded. Typical contents include: Personal information (address, background, military status, health information , etc.) Educational background and professional development (Postsecondary degrees and other types of training) Qualification information (areas of certification and experience) Current employment (job title, salary, insurance, etc.) Assignments (assignment type, program type, location, time period, etc.) Evaluation and career development (performance assessment, etc.) Separation from employment The desired contents should be clearly defined before beginning Step 4 to ensure that all areas of the proposed staff record system are covered, and to eliminate unnecessary duplication. A key to an effective and efficient staff accounting system is for data to be entered only once, and updated in a single place, although different offices may have responsibility for updating certain data elements. This will ensure that data elements needed for more than one purpose are not maintained differently in different files. Step 4 - Select data elements. In this step, each content area is further disaggregated into individual data elements\u2014the lowest level of information contained in a record. For example, in the area of \"staff background,\" information about race, ethnicity, sex, birthdate, language proficiency , etc., would each appear as a separate data element .A critical data element for a staff accounting system is a unique identifier that can be used to ensure that all relevant information about a staff member can be merged. In most staff accounting systems, the Social Security Number (SSN) serves as the unique identifier. However, education organizations may want to consider assigning a different number (such as a random, computer-generated number) for the purposes of analysis and recordkeeping. In many integrated management information systems, teachers' identifiers are a key link to information about their students. Therefore, the use of a different identifier may help guard against the misuse of student or staff data. Within this format, a critical aspect is the definition and coding of data elements. This handbook can be used to provide educators with some standards for definitions and, if deemed appropriate and useful, the data elements defined in chapter 4 may be included in a staff record system. When developing or redesigning a staff accounting system, adopting standards set at a state or national level, or those of a specific software package will facilitate the exchange of data across systems. As more national standards develop, ensuring that local records and those standards match will allow schools and districts to take advantage of automated exchange and analysis methods. The Schools Interoperability Framework (SIF) activity, described earlier, is one effort underway to ensure that all education software packages work together seamlessly. Adoption of national standards does not mean that no local flexibility is possible in the selection or structuring of data. It simply means that for data elements that will be shared, consistent definitions are best, preferably definitions in common use. This will help users accurately interpret information when it is shared or analyzed. Step 5 - Choose the storage media . Data are stored in many ways, ranging from handwritten paper documents; to microfilm or microfiche; to electronic data files on computer tape, disk, hard drive, DVD, zip disk, or CD -ROM. A staff accounting system may use any or all available media if linking or accessing each type of medium is feasible. Maintaining staff information in separate linkable databases, even on separate computers, may best serve security and confidentiality needs while ensuring that data can be merged for analytical purposes. Several considerations are important in the selection of a storage medium, including the number and size of records, storage space available, the permanencyChapter 3- Building A Staff Accounting System 18of the records, and the cost. Cost has at least two components: the cost of entering the data, or exchanging them between media; and the cost of purchasing components, such as filing cabinets, computer disks, microfilming equipment , etc. However, technical advances in computer data entry, storage, and retrieval are quickly making these aspects of staff records management less expensive, more efficient, less demanding of physical space, and more accessible to multiple users. Step 6 - Select a format for the records. The format of a staff record will be directly related to the characteristics of the selected storage medium. Paper records, for example, are often formatted to hold complete, standard English words or numbers. Abbreviations may be used to save space, but generally the format is designed to be easily read. As mentioned above, this handbook can be used in the development of such paper surveys or questionnaires to ensure that the information obtained is consistent with other data collections. Computerized records, on the other hand, tend to use codes rather than words, and may even skip characters such as commas and decimal points to conserve space. In fact, a computerized record may look nonsensical to a reader without a code table and format description. To capitalize on computerized records, this handbook provides examples of how staff record information could be coded to save system space. A computerized data system format is typically organized around the following components: 1. Files: Groups of records of similar format (e.g., a collection of records for multiple staff members). 2. Records : The information maintained about individual staff members. 3. Fields: The exact positions of a data element in a record. For example, in a data record that can hold 80 characters (from position #1 to position #80), the data element \"birthdate\" might be coded as 10141969 (October 14, 1969) and entered into the fields (or positions) 6-13. Other recorded data elements could occupy the remaining positions in the record. 4. Data elements : Single pieces of information (such as a birthdate). 5. Options/codes : Symbols or abbreviations that can be translated into a meaningful value for the data element (for example, the code for a female is 01 in data element 0200, Sex ).Step 7 - Enter or import the data. Data must be brought into the system. Paper systems accept data that are handwritten, typed, or printed out from computers. In a computerized system, on the other hand, data can be entered directly through keying or optical scanning, or imported from another source. SEDCAR is an excellent resource for best practice standards for data collection and entry. Again, data will be entered only once in the most efficient staff accounting system. Instead of asking a staff member to complete a form, from which a clerk copies information onto a roster which is then keyed into a computer file, it is more efficient to have the staff member enter the data directly into a computer, or use an optical scan form that can be later imported directly into the file. Automated edit procedures can ensure that legal characters (i.e., characters accepted by the computer program) are entered, and can even allow for a clerk to edit the information as necessary before a permanent entry appears in the official file. As with other phases of data collection, entry, and use, data confidentiality must be ensured. Therefore, those responsible for entering staff data into the system must be selected carefully, and they must be trained to maintain the data's confidentiality. The previously mentioned document, Privacy Issues in Education Staff Records , contains useful recommendations in this area. Step 8 - Develop procedures for accessing and processing data. Providing a way of getting to the data in order to use the information is probably the most important aspect of designing a data system. Earlier decisions about storage media and format are relevant to this step. In addition, the procedure by which different types of users will gain access to, and manipulate, the records should be described in detail at this stage. For example, if the storage medium is a file in a mainframe computer's memory, then access would be through a terminal, and users might need an identification (ID) code to access the file. On the other hand, data maintained in separate files or separate computers might need to be downloaded into a single computer so that analyses could be done. That computer would therefore need any software programs necessary to create reports or run such analyses. And, of course, individuals who need access to the staff records must have the equipment necessary to do their work, along with the security measures needed to restrict access. Step 9 - Implement security policies and procedures .Chapter 3- Building A Staff Accounting System 19Whether in a paper or an automated system, data must be accessible only to authorized users. Thus, policies must be developed to safeguard the records from improper use. In Step 9, the regulations , policies, and procedures detailed in Step 2 are implemented. State education agencies, school districts, and schools must have policies detailing who has a legitimate right to information about individual staff members, and must provide procedures for providing this access. In addition, additional data security policies must address access to any sensitive data that may be in the staff member's record. As mentioned in Step 5, staff data are commonly maintained in separate databases to limit access to certain parts of the file. Security policies should also ensure that records are not lost, stolen, vandalized, or otherwise rendered useless. Again, SEDCAR provides useful guidelines for ensuring the safety of records. In addition, because physical security cannot be completely guaranteed, all data must be \"backed up.\" This could be as simple as storing a separate paper copy off site, in a location not likely to face the same disaster as the primary location. Computerized files can be simply backed up periodically, but the resulting back-ups should be stored off site. Extensive information about computer security can be found in Safeguarding Your Technology, an NCES document available from the Government Printing Office or online at http://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/safetech .Step 10 - Maintain data integrity and system functioning. In this step, the most important thing is ensuring data quality. Anyone who comes in contact with a staff accounting system shares this responsibility . However, those with the largest stake in data quality are most likely to make the effort necessary to maintain the data's integrity and accuracy . In planning a staff accounting system, therefore, communicating the importance of high quality data to the staff is vitally important. Clear criteria for maintaining high quality data should be provided, and each organization with a staff accounting system should develop a routine or schedule for updating or adding data. Such a schedule is essential for timely and accurate calculation of official statistics. Summary An efficient staff accounting system is as necessary in education as in any other business. Whether new or upgraded, such a system can become a valuable resource. Indeed, a well-designed staff accounting system can provide valuable information about staff members quickly and accurately. As with any major task, however, careful planning and implementation are required to ensure that the designers' goals are achieved and the system functions as desired.2021Chapter 4 DATA ELEMENTS AND DEFINITIONS This chapter contains data elements and definitions to describe staff members, assignments, educational background, relevant activities, and other information that could be maintained about an individual staff member. An attempt has been made to identify all types of information that might be useful for recordkeeping or reporting at the classroom, school, school district , state, and federal levels. The data elements in this chapter do not, however, constitute a required staff accounting system or data collection instrument. There is no federal mandate to collect all of the included information. Rather, this \"dictionary\" is meant to be used to help standardize information collection and reporting in order to facilitate and improve communication within the education community. School administrators or staff members of a local or state education agency could use the data elements in this chapter to design a system for recording staff information or an information system with more than just staff records. Selecting which data elements to collect is the responsibility of the school, local education agency, or state education agency that directs the maintenance of these staff records. Researchers could use the data elements and definitions in other ways. The data elements and their definitions could be used to design a survey to collect information about a sample of staff members, such as a randomly selected group of secondary mathematics teachers or even all staff members within a particular population, such as all elementary school principals within a school district . The data elements and their definitions could also be incorporated into survey instructions to ensure that comparable data are collected. Another use might be to identify data elements that could be used to evaluate a program or analyze student performance for a particular set of teachers. For example, teachers who completed a particular professional development program might be evaluated to determine the program's effectiveness. While the majority of the data elements and other terms in this chapter relate directly to individual staff members, in some instances they might more logically belong in a school record. For the most part, the included data elements are meant to provide important information about staff so that effective decisions can be made about the deployment of human resources. Others have nevertheless beenincluded because they help evaluate school quality and effectiveness. This handbook makes no assumption about how staff-level information is collected or maintained; each data element is included only for the user's consideration. Because of the sensitive nature of some of the data elements, however, only those data elements that are clearly needed should be collected and maintained in the staff accounting system, and plans should be made to remove some information that is no longer needed. How to Read This Chapter This chapter contains the data elements and their definitions listed in seven sections that represent logical groups of data elements. Each data element is accompanied by a definition, any appropriate options, and suggested entity uses. As explained above, options and entity uses are components necessary to place data elements in their proper context. No attempt is made to dictate a structure for the maintenance of staff data. The structure presented here is simply one way that the information could be logically grouped. A SECTION TITLE , typed in bold, upper case letters, describes what type of information is contained in this part of the chapter. Within each section, elements are then divided into Categories . Typed in bold with upper and lower case letters, each underlined category describes a group of related data elements. For example, the category \" Background Information \" includes the data elements \" Country of Birth ,\" \"Marital Status ,\" and \" Address .\" Categories have no assigned numbers, as they merely organize groups of data elements and provide clarification. A Data Element is a bit of data that can be defined and measured. In this chapter, data elements are typed in bold using upper and lower case letters. Examples of data elements are \" Name of Individual ,\" \"Race,\" and \" Birthdate .\" For identification purposes, each data element has been assigned a unique four-digit sequential \"data element number.\" It is important to note that when a data element appears in chapter 4 more than once, it retains the original number it was assigned at its first appearance. For example, although \" Name of Individual \" appears more than once, it is alwaysChapter 4 - Data Elements and Definitions 22identified as number \"0110.\" Where applicable, Options are indented beneath the data elements and typed in bold, italicized lower-case letters with the first letter capitalized. Options give recommended alternatives or responses for a data element ; these options facilitate automated data processing. Options are listed either alphabetically or in a logical sequence, and each has an assigned code number. For example, \" 01 Female \" and \"02 Male \" are options under the data element \"Sex.\" For some data elements, an exhaustive list could not be created even though such a list would have been useful. These cases were handled in two ways: either examples were included, or a partial list was created to meet a perceived user need. For some data elements, available options lists from other sources were referenced. Throughout, the options presentedare meant to be illustrative, not mandatory. In addition, a subset of options might be sufficient for certain applications. It is important to note that some options lists are different in this version of the Handbook, such as those corresponding to data element \"0350 Language Code .\" Some data elements have additional options, either at the end of the list or inserted into the middle of the list (with revised numbering). Still others have options lists where none previously existed. Users of the earlier version should therefore compare the two lists before using their existing systems, and be aware that more changes will likely be made in the future. Entities are persons, places, events, objects, or concepts about which data can be collected. For example, the data element \"Name of Individual \" could be collected to describe a staff member's Emergency Contact , an evaluator, or a health care provider; the entity thus places the data element into a context. A list of entities, definitions, and assigned code numbers precedes the listing of data elements and definitions. Entity Uses are listed for each data element . A number of data elements in the Data Element Outline are marked with a dagger symbol (). A panel of state and local education information system experts identified these data elements as essential for staff accounting systems. These should be given special consideration as they can provide valuable information for managing and evaluating education organizations, or for reporting data to the state or federal government. SENSITIVITY OF DATA ELEMENTS Some data elements in the Handbook are considered sensitive. Their inclusion was decided very carefully, recognizing the complexities of the school environment and the need for essential information when making decisions about educators and other types of staff. In addition, some data elements reflect federal, state, and local data collection requirements. Each agency or unit planning to collect and maintain information about individual staff members must determine which of these should be collected; how the data are maintained; and who will have access to the data, taking into consideration federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Suggestions regarding what data to include, and how to decide who has access to certain types of data, are included in chapters 2 and 3.Revised Numbering System A revised numbering system has been used in this version of the Handbook because many new data elements were added. This should make it easier to insert new data elements in the future. Like the previous version, ten digits separate data element numbers, so that new data elements can be inserted when necessary. However, each new section begins with a thousands-level digit. For example, SECTION C begins with data element number 2010, \" Credential Type, \" and SECTION D begins with data element number 3010, \" Means of Introduction for Employment .\"Chapter 4 - Data Elements and Definitions 23The following example provides a visual overview of how these elements and definitions are arranged. Section Title B. EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES Category Other Non-course Educational Program/Staff Development Activity \u2014The identification of the school, educational institution, agency, or organization that is providing or has provided an educational experience to an individual.

Entity Uses: Staff Member133CHAPTER 5 APPLICATIONS OF THE HANDBOOK One use of this handbook can be the development of more standardized methods of maintaining administrative data about educators and other staff with education-related responsibilities. More and more schools, school districts, and state education agencies are working together to identify essential pieces of information that should be collected about these individuals. These data are used for simple record keeping and reporting as well as for performing analytical studies for informed decision making. Software developers may use this handbook to assist in the development of products that will meet the needs of the schools for a variety of purposes. The selection of data elements for inclusion in a data collection activity must be done with care and sensitivity to the confidentiality of information. Data elements should be selected if they meet identified needs for administrative or analytical purposes. Because so many local, state, and federal education agencies, both public and private, see the utility of computerizing the collection of data on personnel, there is much interest in developing standard formats to promote comparability. This chapter provides one possible design of a staff record system using the data terms and entities from Chapter 4. Another possible application of this handbook and the information in this chapter is in the design of a data collection instrument and the format for how data will be entered into a computer format for analysis. Researchers who use these data elements and formats will benefit when they try to compare or combine data sets for further analyses. Federal and other types of data collectors may be able to ensure greater comparability of data obtained from administrative records systems if their data collection requirements are consistent with how data are maintained. For instance, if field lengths used by data providers and data collectors are consistent with the handbook, data collectors may be assured that essential data will not be truncated or cut off when transferred from administrative record systems. Proposed Staff Data System Application In the table that follows, data elements are grouped by categories and entities to look more like a data collection scheme . Again, data elements are thespecific bits of data that can be defined and measured. Entities are the persons, places, events, objects, or concepts about which data can be collected. For each data element , there is a serial (or sequential) number within the section. For example, the first occurrence of Communication Number , meaning \"communication number of the staff member,\" has a serial number of \"A57.\" When the data element Communication Number occurs again, relating to the Emergency Contact , the serial number is \"A65.\" Each number is unique to the occurrence of the data element in conjunction with an entity. In the second column, the data element has the entity number to which it refers. Again, the data element can occur with more than one entity. In the third column, the data element has the sequential \"data element number\", which is an indication of where the data element and definition occur in order in Chapter 4 of the 2001 Staff Data Handbook. Each data element has only one data element number though it may be used in more than one instance and with different entities. This four-digit number provides a unique identification code for each data element in the scheme. In a computer database, this four-digit number could identify a \"field\" or discrete piece of information. The data element number used in the 1995 Staff Data Handbook for each entity is referenced in the fifth column. For each data element there also is a \"data element type\" listed in the sixth column and a \"field length \" listed in the seventh column. Using the formats of many federal data collections (See the List of Sources for the list of surveys used), data element types and field lengths were chosen. Field lengths were chosen by identifying the longest length used in any current federal reporting format for each data element (if any) or the recommended length used in the Student Data Handbook for Elementary, Secondary or Early Childhood Education . These data element attributes are not meant to be mandatory; they are provided as examples. The state and local education agencies who participated in the field tests of the handbook were asked to provide input into the appropriateness of these attributes. Hence, the types and field lengths listed reflect an attempt to arrive at \"best practice\" attributes.Chapter 5 - Applications of the Handbook 134The possible data element types are as follows: Identifier (ID) - This is a data element that is defined in a code set or list of options. An options list is provided for most of the data elements identified as ID Alpha/Numeric (AN) - This is a data element for which any value is appropriate, that is, letters and numbers can be used in any combination. Generally, this type is used when no standard code list exists or where descriptive information is desired. Numeric (N) - This is a data element that must be a numeric value. These data elements can be further broken down to indicate an implied decimal and the number of places to the right of the decimal. Floating Decimal (R) - This data element type is a special numeric type. The decimal must be included in the value that appears. If the decimal does not appear, the number is assumed to be whole and the decimal appears at the right of the value. Date (DT ) - This data element type is specifically defined as a date. The format will be given in the definition specified in the data collection instrument. All dates in this handbook are assumed to have eight digits, with the first two digits being the month, the next two digits being the day, and the last four digits being the year. Only a maximum suggested field length has been included here. In designing a data collection system, a minimum length is also generally specified. Again, these field lengths are illustrative, not mandated. For numeric data elements that could contain a decimal, the number of places to the right of the decimal are included in the field length . Thus data element \"3400 Base Salary or Wage \" has a field length of 8.2,indicating that there could be a total of ten (10) digits with eight (8) digits to the left of the decimal and two (2) digits to the right of the decimal. If the amount included in this data element is rounded to the nearest dollar, then the final two digits would be zero. Following the data element attributes in the eighth column is the page number on which the data element definition may be found in this handbook. At the end of each table, there are notes about particular data elements to assist the user. Please note that in the table starting on page 138, data elements in conjunction with entities are listed only once. That is, there is only one set of fields for information about an entity, such as an employer. When designing a database, it is useful to allow for possible multiple entries or information loops . Multiple entries are those entries where a data element occurs more than once. For instance, there could be multiple entries possible for types of assignment given to a staff member. In addition, information is sometimes required for each of the multiple entities, requiring the use of loops. Loops can consist of one or more data elements, repeated as necessary, to fully describe multiple entries. For instance, if a staff member has more than one academic degree, a data system should maintain data about the name of the institution of higher education, major or area of specialization, and other relevant items about each one. This handbook attempts to provide a comprehensive list of entities and data elements. There are, however, other possible entities and data elements and many other possible combinations of entities and data elements that might be useful in designing a staff record system. This application is offered simply as an example of how the handbook information could be used in the design of a staff record system. Users of the new Handbook version should note that the serial number may have changed because new data elements have been added.Chapter 5 - Applications of the Handbook 135Serial Number \u2014Sequential number unique to each use of the data element.
