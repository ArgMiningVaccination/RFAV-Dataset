Many toys include an ingredient called PVC (imagine a PVC pipe for plumbing). This plastic often needs additives to make it more flexible. These additives can be harmful to your body in a variety of ways. I learned a lot about this topic by reading [this](https://ecochildsplay.com/2012/03/26/toxic-toys-what-is-that-new-plastic-barbie-smell/) article. Not to mention, plastic and decomposition do not mix! The barbie doll you had when you were little? Yeah, it likely still exists. Don't get me wrong: Not every toy under MY tree this year will be non-toxic. If you keep these ingredients out of your house entirely, I applaud you! I'm just trying to make more informed decisions as I am able. "}
