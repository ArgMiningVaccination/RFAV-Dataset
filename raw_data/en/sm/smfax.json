Appendix F: IRS Checklist 85 4 | P a g e EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CHOC Children's has two hospital campuses - CHOC Children's Hospital ( \"CHOC at Orange \") and CHOC Children's at Mission Hospital ( \"CHOC at Mission \"), collectively referred to as \"CHOC Children's \". While the law requires that each licensed hospital conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (\" CHNA \"), it may be conducted with another hospital or group of hospitals, so long a s the characteristics and specific needs of each hospital's population are distinctly identified where different. Because both CHOC Children's facilities are located within the same county (Orange) , serve many of the same populations and provide many of th e same types and levels of services , CHOC Children's conducted the CHNA for its two facilities simultaneously . Another consideration for issuing a joint CHNA is that many health indicators (morbidity, mortality, etc.,) are only available at the county leve l. This 2019 CHNA report will assist in prioritiz ing the unmet health needs adversely affecting the community . The purpose of the CHNA is to identify community health assets and issues, determine and monitor the overall health of the population, and set health objectives . The final deliverable will then be used to assist the CHOC Board and Senior Management in setting priorities and allocating resources over the next several years. CHOC Children's CHNA Steering Committee comprised of t he following individuals who helped conduct the 2019 CHNA : Shahab Dadjou, Chief Strategy Officer Jena Jens en, Chief Governmental Relations Officer Michael Weiss, DO, Vice President of Population Health Charles V. Golden, DO, Vice President and Executive Medical Director of CHOC Children's Primary Care Network Anita Sankaran, Director of CHOC Children's Primary Care Network Billy Lambon, Senior Strategy Consultant Michael Jones, Strategy Consultan t Roseanne De Lemos, Operations Administrative Resident Note: CHOC Children's did not contract with any third parties to assist in conducting its 2019 CHNA. OVERVIEW 5 | P a g e PRIORITIZED HEALTH NEEDS To prioritize the identified community needs, each member of CHOC Children's CHNA Steering Committee utilized a matrix to measure the burden, severity, impact, and urgency of each CHNA need on a numerical scale of one to fiv e. 1. Burden: Population size with in the community ; 2. Severity: Acuity, risk of mortality, or major loss of function on an individual ; 3. Impact: If this health or socioeconomic issue were not addressed, how severely would this impact the overall well -being of children in Orange County ; and 4. Urgency: Effect on children of waiting to address need ( focused on time and resource availability ). For community needs that were previously identified as a top priority need in CHOC Children's 2016 CHNA, the need was allocated an addition of one point to the total. The total weight of each need from all the committee responses was averaged and then ranked from greatest to least in weight. Based on this methodology, the following health needs were ranked from most to least critical: 1. Mental Health and Autism 2. Access to Pediatric Specialists 3. Immunizations ( Vaccines ) and Infectious Diseases 4. Substance Abuse 5. Pediatric Obesity 6. Respiratory Illness 7. Oral Health 8. Collaboration and Partnerships with School Programs 9. Bullying and Other Stressors in School 10. Pediatric Diabetes 11. Cost of Child Care 12. Housing Affordability The strategies for addressing these gaps can be found in the Implementation Plan on the CHOC Children's website . 6 | P a g e GOALS OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT The Patient Protection and Affor dable Care Act (ACA) (HR3590), Internal Revenue Service section 501(r)(3) and California Senate Bill 697 direct tax -exempt hospitals to conduct a CHNA and develop an implementation strategy to address these needs every three years. The primary goals of th e CHNA include the following: Defining the patient population served by CHOC Children's and the communities from which this population originates; Determining community health needs and resources, including those specifically related to pediatric inpatient and outpatient care; Identifying significant gaps hindering the provision of pediatric primary and specialty inpatient/outpatient services ; and Mitigating the barriers to meeting health and social needs through the development of an Implementation Plan. To meet these primary goals, CHOC Children's 2019 CHNA sought input from experts in public health, local health departments and community m embers who were representative of and providing service to minority groups, low -income individuals and medically underserved populations. Engaging the community in this way helps CHOC Children's develop an informed understanding of the most pressing needs or health gaps existing within communities served. To provide comments about CHOC Children's 2019 ACA, IRS Section 501(r) and California law. See Appendix F for more details. ABOUT CHOC CHILDREN 'S HOSPITAL CHOC at Orange is a licensed 334-bed tertiary /quaternary children's hospital dedicated to the provision of care ranging from prenatal and neona tal (newborns) through 17 years of age , to patients up to 25 years of age diagnosed with certain rare conditions . CHOC at Orange is located at 1201 W La Veta Avenue, Orange, CA 92868. CHOC at Mission is a licensed 54 -bed \"hospital within a hospital\" that treats patients ranging in age from newborn through 17 years of age. It is located at 27700 Medical Center Road, Mission Viej o, CA 92691 on the 5th floor of Mission Hospital. Although CHOC Children's provides healthcare services to pediatric and young adult patients from across the nation, CHOC Children's primary service area (PSA) is Orange County , California . CHOC at Orange and CHOC at Mission are th e only hospitals in Orange County that exclusively treat inpatient pediatric s. The map below shows that CHOC Children's is uniquely positioned to provide pediatric health care services to all Orange County pediatric residen ts. 7 | P a g e MISSION OF CHOC CHILDREN 'S To nurture, advance and protect the health and well -being of children VISION OF CHOC CHILDREN 'S To be the leading destination for children's health by providing exceptional and innovative care 8 | P a g e CORE VALUES OF CHOC CHILDREN 'S Excellence Setting and achieving the highest standards in all we do Innovation Advancing children's healthcare by leading with new ideas and technology Service Delivering unmatched personal experience Collaboration Working together with our colleagues and partners to achieve our mission Compassion Caring with sensitivity and respect Accountability Serving as dedic ated stewards of the lives and resources entrusted to us PROGRAMS & SERVICES CHOC Children's offers an array of primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary services a cross its network of inpatient , outpatient and ancillary centers including, but not limited to, the following: A 30-bed PICU that offers the highest levels of care to critically ill or injured children. CHOC Children's pediatric intensive care specialists are available in the hospital 24 -hours -a-day, seven -days-a-week, along with highly skilled nursing and support staff ; CHOC Children's has a total of 101 licensed inpatient neonatal intensive care (NICU) beds. This includes a 37 -bed, Level 4 NICU at CHOC at Orange ,1 offering critical tertiary and quaternary care for newborn babies suffering from respiratory, circulatory, neurological, surgical and cardiac problems. This unit provides all private rooms ; CHOC at Orange also offers a 12-bed Small Baby Unit, a special unit designed for babies born at less than 28 weeks gestation or who weigh less than 1,000 grams ; and Also s itting on our hospital license , CHOC at Orange operates a 13 -bed, Level 2 NICU at St. Joseph Hospital - Orange , with all private rooms . St. Joseph Hospital - Orange is located next door to CHOC at Orange and is joined by an underground t unnel for fast and efficient patient trans fers. 1 For states and hospitals who use this classification, a level 4 NICU is an intensive care unit that can care for babies as young as 22 to 24 weeks gestational age. The term \"micro -preemies\" is used to describe babies born between 22 and 26 weeks of gestation or smaller than 1 pound 13 ounces. Level 4 NICUs can provide very sophisticated types of respiratory support for very sick babies, including extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation or ECMO. They also offer a wide variety of neonatal surgeries including heart surgeries for babies born with congenital heart disease. 9 | P a g e The following is a list of CHOC Children's inpatient and outpatient services : Adolescent Medicine Oncology (Hyundai Cancer Institute) Eating Disorders Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Program Reproductive Health After Cancer Treatment Survivorship Program Mental Health Blood and Marrow Transplant Program (LGBTQIA) Adolescent Health Care Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma Program Allergy /Immunology Histiocytosis Program Asthma Education Programs Eosinophilic Esophagitis Clinic Neuro -oncology Program Cardiology (Heart Institute) Recurrent and Refractory Cancer Program Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Solid Tumor Program Cardiodiagnostics Ophthalmology Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU) Orthopaedics (Orthopaedic Institute) Electrophysiology (EP) Program Clubfoot and Foot Disorder Program Healthy Lifestyle Classes Fracture Clinic Heart Surgery Hand Program Interventional Cardiology Program Infant and Adolescent Hip Disorder Program Lipid Clinic Limb Program Pacemaker & Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Program Muscular Dystrophy Association Clinic Pulmonary Hypertension Clinic Musculoskeletal Tumor Program Sports Cardiology Program Neuromuscular Disease Program Critical Care Orthopaedic Surgery Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU) Spasticity Clinic Extracorporeal Life Support Program (ECMO) Spina Bifida Clinic Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Spine Cen ter Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) Sports Medicine Program Transport Services Otolaryngology (Ear, Nose and Throat) Dentistry Cleft and Craniofacial Program Dermatology Cochlear Implant Program Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics Vascular Anomalies Center Developmental Services Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Emergency Medicine Rehabilitation Services Emergency Department Physical Therapy Transport Services Occupational Therapy Trauma Center Speech and Language Pathology Endocrinology and Diabetes Developmental Therapy Healthy Lifestyle Classes Plastic Surgery Gastroenterology Brachial Plexus Program Colorectal/Bowel Eosinophilic Esophagitis Clinic Vascular Anomalies Center 10 | P a g e Feeding Program Psychology /Psychiatry Functional Abdominal Pain Program Autism Assessments Gastrointestinal Motility Program Mental Health Services Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Program Neuropsychology Program Intestinal Rehabilitation Program Pulmonology General and Thoracic Surgery Sleep Disorder Center Genetics Radiology /Imaging Hematology Rheumatology Vascular Anomalies Center Metabolic Disorders Urology Metabolic Lab Bedwetting and Daytime Incontinence Program Neonatology /Perinatology Disorders of Sexual Differentiation Program Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Hypospadias Program Neurocritical NICU Spina Bifida Clinic Small Baby Unit Wellness and Primary Care Surgical NICU Adolescent and Teen Medicine High-Risk Infant Follow -Up Clinic Behavioral Services Nephrology Eating Disorders Program Neurology/Neurosurgery (Neuroscience Vaccination Brachial Immunizations Concussion Program Management of Chronic Conditions Craniosynostosis Program Screenings Developmental Services Sports Physicals Down Syndrome Program Urgent Care (Orange Clinic) Epilepsy Program Well-child, Routine and Sick Visits Hydrocephalus Program Muscular Dystrophy Association Clinic Neurodiagnostics Neurofibromatosis Program Neurometabolic Program Neuromuscular Disease Program Neuro -oncology Program Plagiocephaly Clinic Sleep Center Sleep Disorder Center Spasticity Clinic Spina Bifida Clinic Tuberous Sclerosis Program 11 | P a g e COMMUNITY BENEFITS PROGRAM CHOC Children's is committed to the children and families in Orange County who depend on CHOC for care. With the provision of $84.5 million in community benefits in the fiscal year 2018, CHOC Children's continues to provide 89 benefit services to address the following: Healthcare Access: increase access to quality pediatric healthcare resources and information to families, especially low -income and medically underserved, throughout Orange County ; Behavioral Health Access: enhance the community's access to behavioral health information and social and emotional services, targeting the underserved ; Disease Prevention: increase awareness of disease prevention and promote early intervention of major diseases that affect the co mmunity ; Information Resource: provide the community with resources for information and education on health risk behaviors ; Injury Prevention: actively contribute to reducing the number of unintentional injuries to young children, especially targeting lo w-income, ethnically diverse and medically underserved populations ; and Community Action: actively recruit, recognize and advocate for the importance of volunteer leadership and community assistance in providing care for children. To see CHOC Children's Community Benefit Report, please visit CHOC Children's website for the most up - to-date annual public report. 12 | P a g e DEFINITION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PRIMARY SERVICE AREA CHOC Children's primary service area (PSA) was determined by utilizing statewide inpatient data and calculating the patient origin from which the majority of CHOC Children's inpatient population resides. In calendar year (CY) 2017, the most recent year inpatient data was made available, CHOC Children's inpatient market share was 70.5%. The PSA has a total pediatric population of nearly 720,000 . Cities and ZIP Codes making up the PSA include (for the sake of this report , the term PSA and Orange Coun ty are one and the same) : To further characterize the PSA population , secondary data was collected from reputable resources and then analyzed to understand known disparities, community needs and community assets . See Appendix B for list of reputable data sources used within the 2019 CHNA report. ZIP Code City ZIP Code City ZIP Code City ZIP Code City 92656 Aliso Viejo 92703 Santa 92807 Anaheim 92845 Garden 92630 Lake Forest 92704 Santa 92808 Anaheim 92646 Huntington 90720 Los 92705 Santa 92821 Brea 92647 Huntington 92655 Midway City 92706 Santa 92823 Brea 92648 Irvine Newport Stanton 92625 Corona del Mar 92604 Irvine 92662 Newport Beach 90742 Sunset Beach 92626 Costa 92606 Irvine 92663 Newport 92679 Trabuco Placentia CHNA METHODOLOGY 13 | P a g e ENGAGEMENT OF COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS Additionally, community members who represent broad interests of the community were solicited for input to further identify community needs and community assets , such as programs, services and resources that improve the health and well -being of community members. Commun ity stakeholders include regional governmental public health departments and members of medically underserved, low -income and minority populations in the community. In September and October 2019, input was solicited through a combination of i nterviews and survey questionnaire s. CHOC Children's received 232 responses from community members and key informants who are knowledgeable pediatric experts i n Orange County. See Appendix C and D for copies of the questionnaire and survey used to engage t he community. Additionally, no wr itten comments from CHOC Children's 2016 CHNA or Implementation Strategy Plan were received from the community. CHOC Children's will continue to track any submissions made to ensure that all relevant comments are reviewed and addressed by appropriate hospital staff. IDENTIFICATION AND PRIORITIZATION OF NEEDS /HEALTH GAPS Through primary and secondary data collection and analysis, CHOC Children's PSA health needs were identifi ed. To prioritize the health needs, the CHNA Steering Committee members were asked to each complete a decision matrix. In this decision matrix, each identified community health need was assessed on burden, scope, impact and severity using a numerical scale of one to five: 1. Burden: Population size within the community; 2. Severity: Acuity, risk of mortality, or major loss of function on an individual; 3. Impact: If this health or socioeconomic issue were not addressed, how severely would th is impact the overall well -being of children in Orange County; and 4. Urgency: Effect on children of waiting to address need (focused on time and resource availability). For community needs that were previously identified as a top priority need in CHOC Childr en's 2016 CHNA, the need was allocated an addition of one point to the total. The total weight of each need from all the committee responses was averaged and then ranked from greatest to least in weight. A gap analysis was conducted by comparing prioritiz ed health needs with CHOC Children's services and PSA community assets. Additionally, the gap analysis process included an evaluation of the 2016 CHNA and implementation initiatives . From the gaps identified and needs prioritized , an implementation strat egy will be developed to address needs and bridge gaps which is further supported and approved by CHOC Children's leadership and overall organization . INFORMATION GAPS Many social, economic, morbidity, mortality, and health outcomes data points (secondary data) are tracked and recorded at the county level across all population cohorts, including the age cohort 18 +, making it challenging to 14 | P a g e determine the effect these indicators have on just the population CHOC Children's serves. Other qualitative and quantitative information limitations include: Secondary data: Much of the secondary data analyzed is only available at the county level. This limited CHOC Children's ability to decipher and assess social determinants within individual communities within Orange County. CHOC Children's mitigate d this issue by conducting interviews with community stakeholders familiar with the individual communities within Orange County to determine access and availability of healthcare services ; Interviews and surveys : Opinions gathered from community representatives could differ from those of the broader Orange County population. While every effort was made to recruit a sample size representative of CHOC Children's entire pediatric population , the diverse group of participants representing each of the unique cities within Orange County could not be guaranteed. This challenge is expected in metropolitan areas such as Orange County ; Inpatient data: There is an approximate 12-18-month lag in the availability of inpatient data provided by the Office of Statewide Healthcare Planning and Development (OSHPD). CY 2017 is the most recent year OSHPD inpatient data was made available. This lag in data access means CHOC Children's , at times, is assessing the impact of inpatient healthcare initiatives on data that may or may not be representative of the times. This could result in misinterpretations to the actual state of affairs of a given health or social determinant ; Outpatient data: Althou gh CHOC Children's has invested heavily in outpatient data, by purchasing claims data from a third -party vender, this information is neither current (through CY 2018) nor complete (limitations by payer, heath system, self -insured entities, employers, IPA, and Medical Foundations) and therefore limits CHOC Children's ability to conduct a conclusive and holistic assessment of Orange County's current pediatric health needs. In these types of instances, CHOC Children's relied on a combination of historical data as well as interviews (both community and individual input) to provide a more conclusive viewpoint of any possible health or social issues ; and Data lag: The list of data sources included in th is report provides the dates for each of the major data sets referenced when conducting the CHNA . This data was valuable and allowed the identification of health needs relative to CHOC Children's PSA . However, older datasets may not reflect recent trends in health statistics and outcomes . Again, this challenge was mitigated by referencing feedback received from community input to compare and contract possible discrepancies . 15 | P a g e Studying demographics helps uncover possible h ealth disparit ies often attributed to social, economic, and/or environmental disadvantage. According to Healthy People 2020, \"health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles to health based on their racial or ethnic group; religion; s ocioeconomic status; gender; age; mental health; physical disability; sexual orientation or gender identity; geographic location; or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion.\" To reiterate, Orange Cou nty is CHOC Children's PSA. California's total population people of which 22.9% , or 9,125,894 , are children aged 0 -18 years old .2 Orange Count y has 8% of California's total population but 0.5% of its land area. Orange County is the third larg est county in California by population size with 3,252,459 residents in 2019. The median age is 37.9 years old .3 Children (0 -18 years old) make up 22.1%, or 719,221 children ,4 of the Orange County population . Orange County's age cohort 0 -18 is projected to decrease nearly 1% by 2024. POPULATION CHANGE The shifting population trend is important to assess for potential impacts on healthcare providers, healthcare access and utilization of community resources. While the natural population inc rease (births minus deaths) has outpaced migration as the county's principle source of growth, international immigration \u2014largely from Asia and Latin America \u2014has contributed significantly to Orange County's growth over the past 30 years. Between 2019 and 20 24, it is estimated that Orange County will have a 3.6% total population increase .5 2 Esri Demographics - 2019 Population Estimates based in US Census and American Communities Survey 2013 -2017 3 Census.Gov - American Communities Survey 2013 -2017 4 Esri Demographics - 2019 Population Estimates based in US Cen sus and American Communities Survey 2013 -2017 5 Esri Demographics - 2019 Population Estimates based in US Census and American Communities Survey 2013 -2017 Population Cohort 2019 2024 by Age Cohort, 2019-2024 DEMOGRAPHICS 16 | P a g e Age Cohort 0 -18: The Orange County age cohort 0 -18 is projected to decrease by approximately 1% from 719,221 children in 2019 to 712,797 in 2024. This is lower than the California growth rate that is projected to increase by 1% over the same period. Age Cohort 0 -4: The age cohort 0-4 (+4.0%) is the only Orange County age cohort , within the age range 0- 18, that is projected to increase between 2019 and 202 4. This increase is consistent with California. Orange County's age cohort 0 -4 makes up 26% of all children in the county. This percentage is projected to grow to 28% of all Orange County children by 202 4. Age Cohort 5 -9: The Orange County age cohort 5 -9 is projected to contract nearly 2% between 2019 and 2024 to nearly 195,000 children. Over the same period, California's population is projected to rema in stagnant on just over 2.5 million children. The age cohort 5 -9 makes up 27% of the population 0 -18 which is consistent with California overall. Age Cohort 10 -14: The Orange County age cohort 10 -14 is projected to contract by 3% to 212,612 children by 2024. By contrast, California's population is projected to grow slightly to nearly 2.6 million over the same period. Age Cohort 15 -17: The Orange County age cohort 15 -17 is projected to decrease by 3.3% from 122,581 children in 2019 to 118,529 in 2024. This is the steepest decrease across all age cohorts, including adult, within Orange County. The California growth rate for age cohort 15 -17 is projected to decrease by 0.7% over the same period. Age Cohort 18+: Despite the Orange County population 0 -18 projected to shrink nearly 1% between 2019 and 2024, the adult population 18+ is forecast to increase 4.8% to nearly 2.7 million over th e same period . This is higher than the California growth rate of 4.1%. Much of this growth can be attributed to net in -migration among adults embarking on employment opportunities and Orange County aging overall. For this reason, the age cohort 18+ is projected to make up a larger percentage of the overall population (79%) by 2024, an increase of 1% from 2019. California is also projected to age slightly more by 2024 with the age cohort 18+ projected to increase to 78% by 2024. Age Cohort 65+: The Orange County age cohort 65+ is projected to increase nearly 17% from 482,516 in 2019 to 564,170 in 2024. This is the steepest growth in crease across all age cohorts in Orange County . California 's growth rate in the age cohort 65+ is also projected to increase considerably by 2024 but at a slightly slower rate than Orange County overall (16%) . Females 15 -44: This population group is important as it measures the reproductive age span of women assumed for statistical purposes . The number of Orange County femal es 15 -44 is predicted to increase 3.5% from 6 63,768 in 2019 to 687,063 in 202 4. This increase is higher than the California increase of 3.1% over the same period. 17 | P a g e ETHNICITY & RACE Understanding race and ethnicity composition can better assist in determi ning health disparities including higher rates of chronic disease , healthcare access, premature death , and other health determinants affecting a communit y's population. Orange County continues to experience increas ed racial and ethnic diversification. Within the age cohort 0 -18, the racial distribution is as follows : White (49.4%), Some Other Race (21.3%) and Asian (18.2%). Nearly 49% of Orange County is of Hispanic or Latino origin. This is lower than the California Hispanic or Latino population percentage of 54.3%. Among the different Orange County races and ethnicitie s 0-18, White (-5.8%) and American Indian/Alaska Native (-4.3%) populations are expected to see the largest decrease in population change between 2019 and 2024 .6 Over this same period, Asian and Multiple Races are expected to see the largest gain in 0 -18 population increasing by 7.7% and 6.4%, respectively . HOUSEHOLD S According to How Housing Matters, growing up in a n affordable home can have a significant effect on a child's ability to thrive. Other findings on the importance of a suitable home environment for children include: Poor housing quality is associated with higher baseline symptoms of depression, anxiety, and aggression from elementary school through young adulthood ; The strain of household affordability and a history of moving often are associated with adverse health outcomes for effected children ; Compared t o home owners with children, r enter households with children are more likely to have asthma triggers in their homes and are more likely to have at least one child diagnosed with asthma ; Moving schools is associated with lower reading scores ; 6 Esri Demographics - 2019 Population Estimates based in US Census and American Communities Survey 20 13-2017 Pop. % Pop. % Pop. % Pop. 2019-2024 Population CohortOrange County 2019 2024 Change 2019-20242019 2024 18 | P a g e Children living in a housing cost burden environment, including living in homes that are in foreclosure or in tax delinquency, are more likely to receive inferior kindergarten readiness scores than children living in a stable housing environment ; and Children living in a crowded household are less likely to graduate from high school and tend to have lower educational attainment by age 25. Orange County's household populatio n is projected to grow 3.6% from 3,207,763 in 2019 to 3,324,165 in 2024. This i s similar to the projected growth rate in California (3.5%) overall. The current household growth rate of 0.72 is expected to decrease to 0.64 by 2024 . In Orange County, there are a total of 1,060,886 households ,7 with an average household size of 3.02. Over 71% of Orange County's total households are considered Family Households - slightly higher than the California percentage of 69% . Although an estimated 35,000 additional homes will be constructed in Orange Coun ty between 2019 and 2024, the change in population growth (3.6%) is still predicted to outpace the increased number of houses (3.3%) over the same period. This trend is consistent with California (3.5% increase in the size of the population versus 3.1% inc rease in the number of total households) . The number of households with one or more persons with a disability is 203,829 or 19.2% of total households. Having a disabled child may increase stress and affect physical health and make it difficult to find appropriate and affordable child care. HOUSEHOLD INCOME Orange County continues to be among the most inaccessible places to live for low and moderate -income earners. This is a major concern for families as cost burden affect s quality of life. Additionally, t he number of households receiving food stamps or participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) within Orange County is 66,353 or 8. 8% of Orange County's total family households (this is lower than the California rate of 10 .0%). The number of married couple families living below poverty level is 30,957 or 4.1% of total family households. 7 Total households refer to people who are living in a housing structure, and can be made up of family households or non -family householders. Family households is a household maintained by a householder who is in a family and includes unrelated people who may be residing there. The number of family households is equal to the number of families. A nonfamily household consists of a ho useholder living alone or shared home exclusively with people to whom he/she isn't related . 2019 2024 Change 2019 2019-2024 Orange County California 19 | P a g e For 2019, it is estimated that Orange County has an average median household income of $ 88,453.8 This is nearly 20 % higher than the California average of $ 74,520 and 46% higher than the U.S. average of $ 69,180. The percentage of higher -income households ($1 00,000+) in Orange County is projected to grow from 4 4.8% of total households in 2019 to 51.7% of households in 2024. This is significantly higher than the 2024 California (44.0%) and U.S. (33.9%) projections. Orange County's median home value is $682,052 and average rental rate is $2,004 .9 By 2024, Orange County 's home value is estimated to increase to $715,049 and median household income to $102,755 .10 This is a concern as a larger proportion of wage s spent on housing expenses such as rent and mortgage takes away from spending towards preventative care, medical care, cost of raising a child, or vehicle maintenance. Households with low incomes spend a greater percentage of their income on housing. Accor ding to the Legislative Analyst's Office , high home prices force workers in California's coastal communities , like Orange County, to commute 10 % further each day than commuters elsewhere in the nation , largely because limited affordable housing options exist near major job centers. In general, Orange County has higher home values compared to that of the state. California's median home value is $556,621 with median household income of $74,520. By 2024, these values are expected to incre ase to $617,383 and $86,333, respectively. 8 Esri Demog raphics - 2019 Population Estimates based in US Census and American Communities Survey 2013 -2017 9 CoStar.com - As Cited by Collins, Jeff, Orange County Register May 31, 2019 10 Esri Demographics - 2019 Population Estimates based in US Census and American C ommunities Survey 2013 -2017 Variable OC CA USA Estimate 2024 Projection Source: Esri and US. Census, 2019 20 | P a g e EDUCATION LEVELS According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , people with at least some college education have mortality rates (deaths per 1,000 individuals per year) less than half of those without any college education. In addition, people who are more educated exhibit less anxiety and depression, have fewer functional limitations, and are less likely to have a serious health condition like diabe tes, cardiovascular disease or asthma. Nearly 72% of Orange County's population over the age of three are not enrolled in school while 28.3% are enrolled . The Orange County Department of Education is a public education organization offering support to 27 school districts. It is estimated that t here are 493,030 students enrolled in public schools in Orange County. Enrollment is comprised of the following: 49.1% Hispanic or Latino, 27.5% White, 2.1% Filipino, 1.4% Bl ack, 0.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 4.0% Other . In Orange County, a bout 5.7% of high school students drop out of school .11 This rate is less than that of California's high school dropout rate of 10.7% .12 High school dropout rates are important to track when determining educational attainment. Educational attainment is a social determinant of health and is o ne of 26 leading health indicators (LHI) of Healthy People 2020 . Its objective is to increase the proportion of students graduating from high school within 4 years of starting 9th grade. 11 Esri Demographics - 2019 Population Estimates based in US Census and American Communities Survey 2013 -2017 12 California Dept. of Education, California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System .

Specifically, 26.4% of the population obtained a bachelor's degree , 14.7% obtained a graduate/professional degree , and 7.7% achieved an associate degree . Increased education attainment leads to higher incomes that helps in the purchasing of healthy foods, affords more time to exercise regularly, and pays for health services and transportation. Conversely, job insecurity, low wages, and lack of assets associated with less educa tion can make individuals and families more vulnerable during hard times \u2014which can lead to poor nutrition, unstable housing, and unmet medical needs.

According to Attendance Works, kindergarten students who are chronically absent are likely to be less proficient readers and be held back in later grades. The study went on to show that by sixth grade, chronic absenteeism is one of the early warning indicators influencing eventual high school graduation. The report below shows the annual Orange County K -12 public school chronic absenteeism rate by ethnicity. Overall, the Orange County chronic absenteeism rate (8.3%) is lower than that of the California statewide rate (11.1%). Despite Orange County's chronic absenteeism rate being lower than California, many ethnic groups within Orange County recorded rates far higher than the average statewide rate. This included: African American: 13.5% chronic absenteeism rate; American Indian or Native: 16.5% chronic absenteeism rate; and Pacific Islander: 14.5% chronic absenteeism rate. Also assessed was the chronic absenteeism rates of school districts within Orange County. Only three school districts reported higher chronic absenteeism rates when compared to the statewide rate (11.1%). These include the Orange County Department of Educa tion (36.3%), Fullerton Joint Union High (11.7%), and Anaheim Union High School District (11.4%). The school district with the lowest chronic absenteeism rate in Orange County was Fountain Valley Elementary School District. Only 3.7% of the district's 6,51 9 enrolled students were reported as being chronically absent over the course of the school year.

Currently, 44.5 mill ion people in the United States (or nearly 14% of the population ) are foreign born \u2014up from 7.9% in 1990. As this number grows, so does the amount of health utilization by LEP patients increase. An inability to speak English well can create barriers to healthcare access, provider communication, and health literacy and education. Barriers to communication can also result in fewer provider and wellness visits leading to delays in receiving preventative services , which can lead to chronic conditions and increased risk to hos pitalization. According to recent census data, 29.2% of Spanish speaking Orange County residents aged 18 to 64 years, reported that they spoke English either \"not well\" or \"not at all.\" The same study also reported that 22.5% of Asian -Pacific Islanders in Orange County aged 18 to 64, reported that they spoke English either \"not well\" or \"not at all.\" Within the age cohort 5 -17, under 4% of Orange County residents who speak Spanish, reported that they spoke English either \"not well\" or \"not at all.\" Nearly 7% of Orange County residents 5 -17 who speak an Asian -Pacific Islander Lan guage, reported that they spoke English either \"not well\" or \"not at all.\" Some of these children may be born in the U.S. but live in relatively isolated ethnic enclaves.

According to Orange County Child ren's Partnerships (OCCP) , poverty is linked to substandard housing, homelessness, inadequate nutrition, food insecurity, inadequate child care, lack of access to health care, and generally unsafe neighborhoods. The implications for children living in poverty include greater risk for poor academic achievement, school dropout, abuse and neglect, behavioral and socioemotional problems, physical health problems and developmental delays. Evidently, poverty is a relevant indicator as it creates barriers to health promotion and management . The overall percentage of residents living in poverty in Orange County is 12.1%. Approximately 1 6.4% of children (ages 0 - 17) live in poverty, 5.3% of children live in deep poverty (<50% Federal Poverty Threshold) and 5.8% of Orange County children are considered homeless .13 13 U.S. Census Bureau, 2016 American Community Survey.

Health insurance cov erage helps patients enter the health care system whereas a l ack of adequate health insurance coverage makes it difficult for people to get the health care they need . When families with inadequate health insurance do get care they need , they can be burdened w ith large medical bills. According to Healthy People 2020 , uninsured people are more likely to have a poor health status , are l ess likely to receive medical care , and are m ore likely to die prematurely . Through California 's adoption of the ACA , the percentage of statewide population without health insurance has been greatly reduced to approximately 5%. Orange County generally mirrors enrollment levels observed throughout the state but is slightly more affluent and has 5% more employer -based cov erage, 2% more self -purchase coverage), and 4% less Medicaid /Medi -Cal when compared to the rest of the state. Annual health care spending per household in Orange County is approximately 10% higher than the state average at $7,474 per household compared to $6,705 at the state level.

Food insecurity is an important social determinant within the economic stability domain. Food insecurity does not necessarily cause hunger ; however, hunger is an outcome of food insecurity. Food insecurity may reflect a household's need to make trade -offs between important basic needs, such as housing or medical bill s, and purchasing nutritionally adequate foods. Having limited food access due to cost can be associated with chronic morbidities , such as obesity and diabetes. Seth A. Berkowitz , Andrew J. Karter and their colleagues conducted a study to analyze the association between food insecurity, low physical food access (food deserts), and glycemic control (diabetes) . In March 2018, t heir study was published in the American Diabetes Association with the conclusion t hat food insecurity is associated with higher HbA1c (diabetes) . However, living in an area with low physical food access (i.e., food desert s) is not associated with diabetes . Therefore, this study support s governmental efforts such as National School Lunch Program (NSLP), the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP ) reduce food insecurity. 21.2%20.6% 19.3% 2016 2017Orange County Child Food Insecurity Rate Orange County California National Source: Feeding America , 2012-2017 29 | P a g e Feeding America , a not -for-profit organization focusing on food access and nutrition, noted that the food insecurity rate in Orange County , across all age cohorts, was 9.2% . When looking at food insecurity rate for children, Feeding America reported that 15.7% of Orange County children experience food insecurity . This figure has dropped continually since 2012 (21.2% ) and is below the California and National child food insecurity rates. Food insecure children are those children living in households experienc ing food insecurity. The table below ranks the Orange County school districts bas ed on number of children eligible to receive either free or reduced priced meals. Of the 479,000 students enrolled in public schools in Orange County, approximately 49% are eligible to receive free or reduced -price meals . School districts are often the primary source of nutrition for feeding children growing up with food insecurity. This is especially challenging for school districts with over 75% of students enrolled in the free and reduced -price meal program s.

The Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University stated that \"i nadequate nutrition can permanently alter a child's brain architecture and stunt their intellect ual capacity, affecting the child's learning, social interaction, and productivity. Children who do not receive what they need for strong, healthy brain development during early childhood may never recover their lost potential for cognitive growth and even tual contributions to society .\" UNEMPLOYMENT Unemployment is a relevant indicator as unemployment creates financial instability and barriers to access including insurance coverage, health services, healthy food, and other necessities that contribute to poor health status.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the infant mortality rate is a crude indicator of not only community health status, but also poverty and socioeconomic status levels that provide context on the overall availability and quality of local health services. Between 2007 and 2016, the infant mort ality rate in Orange County decreased by 64.3% .16 The Orange County infant mortality rate (3.1 deaths per 1,000) is lower than that of California (4. 4 deaths per 1,000 ) and the nation al objective (6.0 deaths per1,000 ). Even with declines in infant mortality, Orange County sees significant disparities ethnically and racially. T he Hispanic population 's infant mortality rate is 3.8 deaths per1,000 which is higher than the Ora nge County rate of 3.1 deaths per 1,000 . The White population has the second highest ( 2.4 deaths per 1,000 ) and the Asian /Pacific Islander population ranks lowest with 2.1 deaths per 1,000 . Despite th is fluctuation , all races and ethnic ities in Orange County ranked better than the California average (4.4 deaths per 1,000) and Healthy People 2020 national objective (6.0 deaths per 1,000) . In the 24th Annual Report on Conditions of Children in Orange County (2018), the l eading causes of infant mortality in Orange County were : 1. Congenital anomalies (birth defects): 33.7% ; 2.

Natality de pends on both level of fertility and the age structure of populations. In Orange County, the natality rate is 11.9 live births per 1,000 . Preterm birth is defined as delivery of an infant at less than 37 weeks of gestation. It is an important public health issue as preterm infants are more likely to suffer lifelong neurologic, cognitive and behavioral problems, which is why preterm birth require s sustained focus on its causes, consequences, and prevention strategies. Reducing preterm births is a Healthy People 2020 LHI with a goal to decrease preterm live births by 10 percent to reach a target of 9.4% by 2020. Currently, the national percentage of preterm births is 9.9%. Both California (8.7%) and Orange County (8.0%) meet the Health y People 2020 target. Teen birth s (births to mothers aged 15 -19 years old) is another public health issue that not only aff ects children but families and society . Teen mothers are less likely to complete high school or college, more likely to require public assistance , and more likely to live in poverty when compared to peers who are not mothers .17 Additionally, infants born to teen mothers have lower probab ility of obtaining emotional and financial resources and are at greater risk for low birth weight, preterm birth, and death in infancy .18 In Orange County, the teen birth rate is 10.8 births per 1,000, which is considerably less th an the California (15.7 births per 1,000) and national (18.8 births per 1,000) teen birth rate . 17 Orange County Children's Partnership (2019).

Morbidity is relevant because current behaviors are determinants of future health . It may illustrate which diseases and conditions are prevalent and who is more likely to be come afflicted. In Orange County, the California Department of Public Health reported on the following morbidities affecting the overall population of Orange County . Overall, Orange County meets the national objective in two of five ava ilable morbidity indicators . IMMUNIZATIONS (VACCINES ) Understanding immunization rates is an important public health indicator for overall health of a community. Having kids properly immunized can help prevent many serious and once -common childhood infections . The immunization rate focuses on up-to-date vaccine records of children beginning kindergarten . According to the Orange County Children's Partnership (OCCP) report, the immunization rates for kindergartners are at their highest level in 10 years. In Oran ge County, 92.5% of children are properly immunized by the time they reach kindergarten . This rate is similar to that of California . California already has some of the strictest vaccination laws in the country, preventing children from skipping immunizations unless exemption is provided by a doctor for some type of medical reason. Health advocates are concerned that parents are obtaining exemptions for their children without valid medical reasons after it was reported that since stricter laws took effect in 2017, there has been a 70% increase in medical exceptions for vaccines . In the 2018/2019 school year, ther e were approximately 1,500 schools in California that had kindergarten vaccination rates below 95%. Orange County reported 125 school s with vaccination rates below 95%.

The CDC lists the following set of facts on the widespread abundance of mental health dis orders affecting children across the nation: 9.4% of children aged 2 -17 years have received an ADHD diagnosis ;23 7.4% of children aged 3 -17 years have a diagnosed behav ior problem ; 7.1% of children aged 3 -17 years have diagnosed anxiety ; 3.2% of children aged 3 -17 years have diagnosed depression ; and 1 in 6 U.S. children aged 2 -8 years (17.4%) had a diagnosed mental, behavioral, or developmental disorder. One measure to determine demand for mental health services is to study the age -adjusted Emergency Room (ER) rate , of patient s under 18 , with a primary diagnosis related to mental health . Orange County has 29.8 ER visits per 10,000 populations under 18 years old .24 As seen in the graph below, the age cohort with the highest ER utilization was age cohort 15 -17 (93.7 per 10,000), followed by age cohort 10 -14 (59.7 per 10,000), and age cohort 5-9 (7.0 per 10,000). Compared to other California counties, Orange County falls within the top 50% of counties who do well in addressing ER utilization for mental health. According to the Orange County 's Healthier Together (an initiative led by the Health Improvement Partnership) , treatment for mental disorders is a major cause of hospitalization for children and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 21 years. As for hospitalization rate due to pediatric mental health, Orange County's age -adjusted rate is 18.5 hospitalizations pe r 10,000 populations under 18 -year- 22 Orange County Children's Partnership (2019).

Substances such as alcohol, marijuana , and nicotine are considered drugs. Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish signs of drug us e, which the Mayo Clinic identified as: Problems at school or work ; Physical health issues, such as lack of energy and motivation, weight loss or gain, or red eyes ; Neglected appearance ; Changes in behavior ; and Indebtedness . Healthy People 2020 focuses on reducing substance abuse to protect the health, safety , and quality of life for all people , especially children. The effects of substance abuse affect individuals, families and communities. The Health y People 2020 substance abuse LHI objective is to reduce the number of adolescents using alcohol or illicit drugs in the past 30 days by 10%. Overall, Orange County youth reported less al cohol and drug use (AOD) when compared to California when assessing alcohol consumption and drug use in the past 30 days: According to OC Health Care Agency (OCHCA), a lthough Orange County youth are reporting less alcohol and drug use compared to statewide averages , Orange County is seeing an increase in drug -related overdose deaths (of ~80% between 2000 -2017) across all age groups. Opioid According to OCHCA, drug overdose (poisoning) is now the leading cause of unintentional injury death in the United States, causing more deaths than motor vehicle crashes. Opioids - both prescription painkillers and heroin - are responsible for most of those deaths. Nationally, there is sizeable attention to the growing opioid epidemic. The number of Californians affected by prescription and non -prescription opioid misuse and overdose is substantial, with rates varying significantly across counties, and even within counties . The OCHCA noted that coastal cities of Orange County are reporting higher opioid use compared to other cities within the county.

California Department of Education (Jul. 2017). 42 | P a g e Alcohol According to research by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, adolescents who begin drinking at a youn g age are more likely to develop alcohol dependence than those who begin drinking at age 21. Patterns formed during adolescence play a critical role in health throughout adulthood. Alcohol use also impairs judgment and can lead to other high -risk behaviors such as driving while intoxicated . As part of the California Healthy Kids Survey, youth were asked if they had ridden in a car driven by someone who had been drinking alcohol or if they had ever driven a car when they had been drinking alcohol in their lifetime . Compared to California, Orange County youth were less likely to drink and drive or ride with someone who had been drinking alcohol. However, of concern is the high percentage of 9th grade (12.2%) and 11th grade (16.9%) students who repo rted drinking and driving or rid ing with someone who had been drinking . In Orange County, 9th grade (14 -15 years old) and 11th grade (16 -17 years old) students are less likely to drink and drive or ride with someone who has been drinking when compared to students in non -traditional programs. Vaping Vaping is a more recent phenomenon that is quickly building traction with teens and young adults. Vaping is the inhaling of aerosol from a vaping device that heats a liquid that can contain various flavored substances including nicotine, marijuana (THC), and cannabidiol (CBD). These devices are frequently referred to as e -cigarettes, e cigs, vapes, vape pens, electronic vaporizers, pod mods, or pod systems. According to the CDC , more than 3.5 million teens reported using e -cigarettes in 2018. This is a nati onal increase of more than 1.5 million teens from 2017. From 2017 to 2018, use of e -cigarettes across the United States increased from 11.7% to 20.8% among high school students and from 3.3% to 4.9% among middle school students. On September 24, 2019, th e California Department of Public Health (CDPH) released a health advisory related to the public health risks posed by vaping any product. The advisory stated that as of June 2019 in California, CDPH has received reports that two people have died and 90 people with a history of vaping were hospitalized with severe breathing problems and lung damage . The CDPH's studies show lung damage from vaping to be sudden, effecting both young people who have not been vaping for a long time, and healthy people who do not have a history of lung disease. According to the CDPH, t eenagers and young adults make up nearly 50% of all breathing related hospitalizations from vaping in California.

California Department of Education (Jul. 2017). 43 | P a g e Aside from the physic al health risks associated with vaping and the use of e -cigarettes, the California Department of Education reports that extended use of these products can also lead to mental and behavioral health risks including d epression, anxiety, and other mood disorde rs. The CDPH has the following recommendations for the public: Quit vaping altogether, no matter the substance or source. Those that c ontinue to vape are urged to avoid buying any vaping products on the street and never modify a store -bought vape product ; Anyone who has in the past few months vaped and is having problems with breathing , or other related symptoms, should seek medical care immediately ; and Do not replace vaping with smoking combustible cigarettes but rather ask your doctor for FDA- approved quitting treatments. In 2018 , there were 86 vaping retail outlets in Orange County, down 75% from the number reported in 2014/2015. The decrease in the number of stores is related to a 2017 enacted California law that increased the minimum ag e of purchase to 21 years of age , as well as requir ing such stores to apply and retain a California retailer tobacco license. According to a California Healthy Kids survey, 27.5% of high school students, and 13.4% of middle -school students , reported hav ing tried vaping. These statistics are higher than the national average reported by the CDC. ASTHMA Asthma is a long -term condition in which a person's air passage become s inflamed. It is a serious public health problem, especially in Orange County, as it can cause missed school days, daily activity limitations, ER visits, and even hospitalization. Additionally, studies have shown that asthma disproportionately affects low -income and minority children. 14.1% of Orange County's pediatric population have been diagnosed with asthma, which is a growing trend .26 26 Conduent Healthy Communities Institute , 2014-2015 California Health Interview Survey .

The admits per 1,000 patients remained steady between 2012 and 2014 before spiking to 1.23 admits per 1,000 in 2016 and 1.17 admits per 1,000 in 2017. OBESITY AND DIABETES According to Orange County's Healthier Together, obesity and diabetes are major contributors to the leading causes of death including heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. Diabetes is itself a major cause of death and the rate of those living with di abetes has been increasing in the last 30 years. The increasing trend of obesity and diabetes is heavily influenced by a person's community and health habits. The CDC defines c hildhood obesity as a child who is well above the normal or healthy weight for his/her age and height . The CDC noted that more than one -third (35%) of U.S. Children ages 2 -19 are overweight or obese. Childhood obesity can cause chronic diseases , such as Type 2 diabetes which is a c ondition of having high blood sugar levels . Although Type 2 diabetes most often develops in people over the age of 45 , more children, teens , and young adults are developing it. 755 752 736801892 847 1.04 1.031.011.111.23 1.17 0.70.80.91.01.11.21.31.41.5 01002003004005006007008009001000 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ADMITSOrange County (Age Cohort 0 -17) Bronchitis & Asthma Emergency Department Admits by Year, 2012 -2017 Bronchitis & Asthma Admits Bronchitis & Asthma Admits Per 1,000 Source: OSHPD Discharge Database, 2012 -2017 45 | P a g e To tackle this national issue, Healthy People 2020 LHI is focused on reducing the proportion of children and adolescents aged 2 -19 years old who are considered obese. The obesity population among youth in Orange County is less than that of California and is on target for Healthy People 2020 LHI. The table to the right shows Orange County 5th grade students who are obese, by school district . Although the overall percentage of Orange County 5th graders (18.4%) who are obese is lower than the California av erage (21.3%), many school districts meet neither the state average or national objective (14.5%). Of the 26 public school districts serving 5th graders in Orange County, only eight meet the national objective; Laguna Beach Unified School District (3.5%) recorded the lowest percentage followed by Irvine Unified School District (7.1%), Huntington Beach Unified School District (8.9%), Capistrano Unified School District (9.8%), and Fountain Valley Elementary School District (9.9%). However, 16 of 26 Ora nge County school districts fall short of the national objective, nine of which do not meet the California average either. The school districts with the highest percentage of obese 5th graders in Orange County include; La Habra City Elementary School District (33.3%), Buena Park Elementary School District (29.6%), Anaheim City Elementary School District (29.5%), Santa Ana Unified School District (28.1%), and Magnolia Elementary School District (26.1%).

The table below shows 5th grade obesity rates by ethnicity /race in Orange County. According to the California Department of Education, o ver 38% of Orange County's Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander 5th graders are obese. This is nearly three times the national objective and twice the average of Orange County overall. Also concerning is the high Latino obesity rate among 5th graders (26.8%) . nearly twice that of the national objective. The Asian (8%) and White (9.9%) 5th grade obesity rates we re considerably lower than the Orange County average (18.4%), California average (21.3%), and national objective (14.5%). Obesity statistics by ethnicity and race are an important measure as cultural perspectives on obesity can pose challenges for unders tanding the extent of the problem leading to a lack of precautionary measures.

Breastfeeding provides benefits to the mother as it can mitigate maternal risks of postpartum bleeding, post -menopausal osteoporosis, and cancer of the breast and ovaries .28 Additionally, breastfeeding helps the entire family with food security and income because the family income does not have to be spent on buying formula. In Orange County, the percentage of newborns who were exclusively fed breast milk during their hospitalization is 65.8% , less than that of California. The percentage of newborns who were breastfed exclusively and those who received both breast milk and for mula was 94.8% in Orange County. 28 Orange County Children's Partnership (2019).

Also, s ee Appendix E for a list of community assets identified by community members. ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE A lack of access to primary care presents barriers to preventative care and good health. The supply and accessibility of primary care physicians, the type and lack of insurance coverage, poverty level, transportation obstacles, and cultural and language competency affect access. Individuals in communities affected by barriers to primary care have shown increased rates of morbidity, mortality, and emergency department hospitalizations. These can all be reduced if residents have access to primary care services , including health screenings, routine tests, and vaccinations. If an average pediatrician performs 5,000 primary care encounters per year, we can estimate the number of full- time-equivalent (FTE) physicians practicing in the market. In 2018, primary care physicians with an office location based inside of Orange County rendered over 2.2 million patient visits. At the same time, Orange County resid ents aged 0-18 consumed approximately 1.8 million patient visits in Orange County. This means that Orange County is net -provider of pediatric primary care visits to the point that over 360,000 pediatric visits were re ndered to patients living outside of Orange County by physicians practicing inside Orange County. Assuming the average pediatrician performs 5,000 primary care encounters per year, we can estimate the number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) physicians practicing in the market. Using this methodology, Orange County is a net supplier of pediatric primary care services with the equivalent of 442 providers operating in the county and local patient demand for only 369 providers . In other words, there is an excess of 73 primary care providers in Orange County that are serv ing patients originating from Los Angeles, San Berna rdino, and Riverside - counties that have known primary care physician shortages.

It was made available in September and October 2019 , which allowed CHOC Children's to receive 207 responses. The survey was not intended to be a scientific or statistically valid sampling of the population. Instead, the survey was designed to collect both qualitative and quantitative data from residents \u2014including those in medically underserved, low -income, and minority populations \u2014in order to identify perceived community health needs affecting children within Orange County. In order to qualify to participate in the survey, respondents had to meet two criteria : 1) that they lived within the boundaries of Orange County , and 2) that they be a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 18.

Nearly 95% of survey respondents reported their own children's health as \"very good\" (47%) or \"good\". Less than 5% reported their children's health as fair with only one respondent reporting their child /children being in \"poor\" health. HEALTH BEHAVIORS The survey re spondents were also asked to list the three most common and serious \"risky behaviors\" affecting children living in their community. In total, 621 votes were cast (3 per respondent). The survey included health and safety concerns often associated with a thr iving and healthy community. Overwhelmingly, drug abuse (20% of the vote) was listed as the most serious \"risky behavior\" followed by alcohol abuse (16% of the vote), and lack of exercise/physical activity (12% of the vote). The remaining 50% of the vote included poor eating habits (10%), being overweight (9%), unsafe sex (6%), and lack of immunizations (5%). In addition, survey respondents were asked what other health issues affected children living in their communities. Seven respondents replied in total. Of the seven, two believe vaping to be of concern, and one on the risks associated with texting and driving. HEALTH PROBLEMS The survey respondents were asked what they believed to be the three most important health problems that affect childre n within their communities (i.e., the three problems that have the greatest impact on overall health of children in Orange County). In total, 621 votes were cast (3 per respondent). Over 19% of the votes cast 59 | P a g e referenced \"bullying and other stressors at sch ool\" as the most important health problem affecting children in Orange County. \"Mental or behavioral health\" ranked as the second most important health concern, with 12% of the vote, and \"obesity\" ranked third, with 9% of the vote . Other health concerns re ferenced by survey respondents include \"child abuse\" (8% of of \"physical activity\" (5% of the vote), \"suicide\" (5% of the vote), and \"cancers\" (5% of the vote). Only 2% of survey respondents believe dental problems to be a top health problem for children in the county. 60 | P a g e DEMOGRAPHICS OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS AND SURVEY PROCESS CHOC Children's solicited input from knowledgeable community members who are considered experts in the fields of health policy and/or population health. They serve children and families in Orange County, including members of the unde rserved, low -income , and minority populations . In total, CHOC Children's had 25 participating key informants. See Appendix B t o see the full list of community groups and their representation of , or service to , low-income, medically underserved , and minority populations . Their opinion was acquired through a combination of one-on-one interviews and surveys distributed through email in September and October of 2019. SURVEY FINDINGS Throughout this process, several themes emerged regarding patient access, preventative care, gaps in services, and opportunities to enhance and improve upon the services currently provided in Orange County. Mental Health Services Almost all the interviewees listed the importance of improving pediatric access to mental health services, including enhanced coordination of care in order to successfully treat behavioral health conditions and improve patient outcomes, as one of the most critical h ealth needs facing Orange County. The interviewees explained that more mental health resources would help families and children who have difficulty finding and accessing mental health services in the county. The interviewees believe pediatric mental health conditions, if left untreated, could have dire consequences well into their adult years. Many interviewees expressed concern in the high prevalence of anxiety and depression among the school -age population in Orange County. Interviewees attribute these often-untreated conditions with bullying and other stressors in school, social media and screen time, which can lead to low school attendance rates, lack of physical activity, and, in extreme cases, teen suicides. Suggestions offered by interviewees include courses offered by mental health professions for school nurses to assist in identifying early symptoms, additional mental health resources to families through improved access to community -based education and learning, and access to pediatric mental health services. Interviewees believe children today are under far more pressure in the era of social media. Several interviewees attributed depression and anxiety to social media and screen time. This belief is supported by a longitudinal study published in the journal The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health that interviewed almost 10,000 children between the ages of 13 and 16 years of age . They found that social media may harm girls' mental health by increasing their exposure to bullying and reducing their sleep a nd physical exercise. Although conclusions of this study focus on one gender, this study is among many that support the association between mental health of children, social media and other health outcomes . Several respondents supported the notion that bullying among students was of critical health concern in Orange County. Some interviewees believe greater coordination and access to pediatric mental health specialists and services would eliminate barrier s to adequately treating children needing mental health services in Orange County. KEY INFORMANT SURVEY 61 | P a g e Specific mental health services believed t oo inadequate or in short supply include universal screening for mental health and suicide risk. Some suggested to address deficien cies in mental health services. Interviewees commented that improved communication between CHOC Children's and schools/school districts, through electronic health system access and shared standards of care, would assist in providing enhanced and expanded c oordinated care. Obesity Since CHOC Children's 2016 CHNA, obesity continues to rank as a top concern in Orange County. Obesity is associated with chronic diseases \u2014such as asthma, sleep apnea, ADHD, and metabolic disorders \u2014and other critical conc erns like bullying , stress in school, low self -esteem, mental health, and suicidal ideations. Pediatric public health key informants have attributed a high incidence and prevalence of obesity to risky behaviors and to systems that use food as a positive reinfor cer. Risky behaviors include children's dietary choices (being picky eaters) and their sedentary lifestyle caused mostly by increased screen time. Another risky behavior that our key informants from school districts noted is the increasing number of studen ts trying to get a doctor's note to avoid Physical Education (P.E.) . This, along with lack of obesity education , exacerbates the problem. Obesity education is accessible through community evidence -based programs and interventions, such as teaching parents food parentings practices (FPPs) that are useful strategies to influence the amount and types of food a child eats. Accessible community evidence -based programs and interventions are concern s for providers and families alike. Especially co ncerning are families and children in the low-income and medically underserved populations where disparities exist . Some key informants noted that not on ly does reimbursement affect their ability to provide these resource s to the populations in need , but a lso families' ability to pay are hindering their pediatric obesity treatment and management . In addition to costs related to reimbursement , another concern is transportation to these resources. Consistent attendance and participation in these evidence -based programs and interventions are necessary to ensure change of behavior for both children and their families . Because Orange County is a diverse metropolitan area with diff erent racial and ethnic groups, another challenge is the cultural pers pective on obesity. Educating families and children on obesity is difficult, and key informants commented during the surveys and one -on-one interviews that it is the responsibility of physician s to educate families on Body Mass Index ( BMI) and explain the diagnosis of obesity. The language barrier adds another layer of difficulty for educating certain ethnic groups on proper nutrition and healthier options. Even with free community -educational classes and provider efforts in education , another challenge to consider is the cost of these healthier food choices to ensure proper nutrition. The cost of healthier foods is more expensive than the cheap, quic k, and convenient fast foods that are available in O range County, wh ich boasts a diversity of trendy food chains. In addition to cost of healthier food options, there are food deserts to consider .29 Key informants also identified a lack of green space (park l and) for recreational activities . These are important resources for communities to live a healthier, active lifestyle. Although Orange County is ranked one of the safest counties (with low crime rates) in the nation, some cities within the county still have crime and 29 A food desert is an area that has limited access to affordable and nutritious food . 62 | P a g e community violence that deter outdoor activities. Housing, environmental quality, and crime and community violence all play a part in the healthier lifestyle that reduces incidence and prevalence of obesity. Overall, t he problem with obesity is multilayered and complex as desc ribed by key informants and secondary research , but there are many ways in which to address this critical community concern. Key informants suggested to strengthen and continue partnership and collaboration between CHOC Children's, agencies, other organiza tions, and most especially school systems. Data shar ing can help with communication and connecting families to pediatric specialists and other community resources. The key informants have so far identified Dr. Riba's Health Club, CalOptima's weight loss program, Team KiPOW, and many others . To find the list of the mentioned community assets, see Appendix E. The key is collaboration. Diabetes Another major concern for the pediatric populat ion, especially those in the Irvine, Fullerton, La Habra, and Buena Park as identified by key informants , is Type 2 Diabetes (also known as adult -onset diabetes ). According to Mayo Clinic, there is no cure for Type 2 D iabetes , but losing weight, increased physical activity and proper nutrition are ways of managing this chronic disease. Key informants identified the se challenges when managing Type 2 Diabetes: lack of access to healthy foods ; need for more partnerships and collaborations with other agencies ; increased social media exposure and screen time ; and decreased physical activity. As noted by key informants, the w ays to overcome these obstacles include CHOC Children's NEW You (Nutriti on, Exercise, Wellness), Kids Fit Club, and PODER (Prevention of Obesity and Diabetes through Education and Resources). These classes are free and available to both the children and their families. Having on - site diabetes prevention classes for families is another important resource . Food Insecurity Key informants identified obesity and diabetes as concerning morbidities , which is why some key informants are attributing food insecurity as a root cause and major issue that needs to be prioritized and addres sed. They identified food insecurity as a highly critical need because it is often overlooked and not discussed . The lack of discussion and community concern impacts the most vulnerable populations . When families are faced with food insecurity, this becomes their top priority . This means that making well child visits, making sick child visits and managing c omplex conditions become secondary priorities to food security. To keep the discussion alive, key informants emphasiz ed existing community resources already addressing the issue, such as the \"No Kid Hungry\" program and \"Waste Not OC \" Coalition. They suggest having more awareness and collaboratio n. An a dditional list of community assets can be found in Appendix E. Respirator y Illness Respiratory illness is another critical health concern that almost all key informant interviewees mentioned as important to address . The concern for respiratory illnesses is attributed to the increasing prevalence of asthma and allergies , which is further exacerbated by environmental quality (air pollution) in Orange County. Asthma is one of the most critical respiratory illnesses needing to be addressed. In Orange County, it has been increasing over the past three decades and is a major cause of ED visits, hospitalizations, and school absenteeism. Most especially worrisome is the disparity seen among the underserved population. This is in part due to language barriers; lack of resources and access to pediatric specialists; immediate ident ification and 63 | P a g e connectivity to resources; and need for education to understand the respiratory disease treatment and management. Another barrier is social media or screen time for respiratory illnesses - being cooped up inside rather than outside is also a concern , especially if living conditions frequently trigger asthma attacks. To address respiratory illness, CHOC Children's Breathmobile program, which has been serving the community for 17 years, has been commended and highly valued by the community, incl uding Hoag Hospital's Community Benefit Program. It has been suggested that more mobile clinics , like the Breathmobile , be distributed through Orange County as it provide s additional support and resources while improving access for underserved isolated children and families. CHOC Children's Breathmobile program further increases access to high risk asthmatic s as home visits are made to assess and remediate key allergic and nonallergic triggers by providing house dust mite covers to those sensitive to this a llergen, for instance. Additional suggestions focus on improving communication and collaboration between CHOC Children's, agencies, the community, and the children and families. The use of electronic health systems was suggested as one platform for achievi ng collaboration . Substance Abuse In CHOC Children's 2016 CHNA , substance abuse was named a critical concern for Orange County. For the 2019 CHNA, substance abuse is once again referenced as a major health concern. More specifically, Orange County key informants have emphasized concern for vaping (which includes electronic cigarettes termed \"e - cigarettes\") \u2014a risky behavior causing respiratory illnesses . Vaping impacts the health and well -being of children and families. Key Informants collectively mentioned that prevention is a challenge because flavored vape juices are trendy and marketable to consumer palates. In addition, lack of access to pediatric specialist; lack of community -based education; the need fo r more school programs; and additional partnership and collaboration between community assets are all barriers to addressing this risky behavior. This is a public health crisis , not only in Orange County but nationally , as more cases of vaping induced lun g- injuries are becoming prominent. A t the release of this report, the CDC is currently investigating 1,000 lung injury cases believed to be induced by vaping . As investigations are underway, key informants believe that more public awareness and prevention campaigns need to happen at the county level. The recommended solution to reduc ing and limit ing vaping throughout Orange County is through improved c ollaboration between CHOC Children's, public agencies, and other community organizations. Bullying and Other Stressors in School Bullying and other stressors in school were identified as another major concern associated with mental health, obesity , and hunger . Key informants have observed an increased number of students with physical symptoms of stress and anxiety. This is due to stressors in school such as schools and families having higher and higher expectations of students. More specifically, bullying \u2014an aggressive behavior \u2014is an added stressor to the school environment. The CDC defines bullying as a form of youth violence that may \"inflict harm or distress on the targeted youth including physical, psychological, social or education harm .\" This is a concern for all of Orange County , especially for Orange, Anaheim, Garden Grove, Santa Ana, Tustin, Buena Park, Irvine, and Villa Park school districts. Some of the interviewed attribute d bullying to these challenges : lack of access to specialists (especially mental health services) ; lack of community -based education; increased screen time and social media exposure ; alcohol 64 | P a g e and substance abuse; poor housing; and the need for partnership and collaboration with other organizations and community efforts. To reduce bullying and other stresso rs in school , experts have suggested counseling , community support programs , and education around available resources to students and their families. A key resource often utilized to address bullying are the Family Resource Centers located all over Orange County. These suggestions are in line with CDC Violence Prevention strategies and approaches to bullying incidences: Promoting family environments that support health development ; Provide quality education early in life ; Strengthen youth's skills ; Connect youth to caring adults and activities ; Create protective community environments ; and Intervene to lessen harms and prevent future risk . Child Safety The overall concern of child safety is a critical need identified by several of the key informants . One of the key informants noted that child safety related to motor vehicle accidents is a major concern that CHOC Children's should address because of the significant injuries that can happen to children. Suggestions to address child safety from traumati c injuries caused by motor vehicle crashes include the continuation and implementation of community -based prevention programs, such as car safety seat training and the no texting -driving program . These programs , in addition to supporting trauma programs and improving acute trauma care systems , are significant measures to address child safety. In addition to education of community members and the existence of pediatric trauma specialists, challenges and opportun ities to address child safety from moto r vehicle accidents include treatment of alcohol and abuse , mental health , and continued organization of trauma system of care among hospitals, providers, fire departments and ambulance companies. Furthermore, child safety encompasses the need to protect children from child abuse and neglect. The CDC defines A dverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) as a term used to describe all types of abuse, neglect, and other potentially traumatic experiences that occur to people under the age of 18. Studies have shown that as the number of ACEs increases, so does the risk for the following outcomes: Injury (i.e. traumatic brain injury) ; Mental health issues (i.e. depression, suicide) ; Maternal health issues (i.e. pregnancy complications, fetal death) ; Infectious disease (i.e. HIV, STDs) ; Chronic diseases (i.e. diabetes) ; Risky behaviors (i.e. substance abuse) ; and Opportunities (i.e. education). The outcomes of ACE have so far been identified as critical concerns during CHOC Children's 2019 CHNA ; however, few key informants have identified ACE as a root-cause of these concerns. By protecting children from 65 | P a g e ACE and focusing on providing them positive experiences, then the ACE outcomes (i.e. mental health, chronic diseases, and substance abuse ) can also be addressed. ACE is a critical concern that is just as complex and multidimensional . Barriers to preventing ACE include the lack of family education , which can mea n parents' low educational attainment and/or lack of knowledge on the importance of infant mental and brain development for instance . Additional barriers to addressing ACE in Orange County include the lack of access to health care services (especially physician specialists) ; the stigma of obtaining help; the lack of standard screenings especially for mental health; poverty; and the prevalence of domestic violence. Key informants noted that A CE is preventable so long as CHOC Children's, agencies , and other community efforts collaboratively work together to identify individuals needs and barriers . Working together is a partnership on intergovernmental transfers to address service gaps and most especially, promote systems improvement. This requires the use of electronic health records ; the education of providers , families and children ; and increase d resources (inclusive of reimbursement and people to run evidence -based programs , and interventions). Key informants also identified current community resource s that are currently use d to address child safety, such as MOMS of Orange County, school programs, Family Resource Centers , Western Youth, and Be Well . To see full list of resour ces, see Appendix E. Oral Health Oral care was a top concern for Orange County community members in the 2016 CHNA . For key informants in the 2019 CHNA process, a few noted that concern for oral care still exists . Dental disease is the number one most commo n pathology in pediatrics , and Orange County has a significant need for these services . Particularly, pediatric physicians and their representative s have noted a high need of routine dental care under general anesthesia. Due to high costs and lack of access to pediatric dentists, especially those providing general anesthesia or sedation, families are avoiding dental care altogether . The reason s for avoiding dental care is due to more pressing living needs that families need to address . Should these families need dental care, then the dental work is because of a major dental concern . In other words, families wait until the dental problem becomes a major problem before addressing the issue . Language barriers and parent carelessness and/or neglect are other reasons why preventive dental care are at low utilization rates. Additionally, s ome key informants discussed the lack of community -based education (or community learning) . For instance, many parents do not understand the importance of proper oral healthcare and often assume baby teeth do not need the same level of care as adult teeth. Another key informant highlighted the lack of pediatric dentists that accept Medi -Cal in Orange County . This observation is supported by The Orange County Local Oral Health Program (OC -LOHP) assessment of primary reasons for non - utilization of dental service s, which are primarily cost and acces s, respectively. Overall, key informants have agreed that expanding access to pediatric dentists, especially for kids who need general anesthesia or sedation, and increasing oral care education opportunities can help address dental care concerns . Some resources used to add ress oral include: school -based education, Boys & Girls Club, Healthy Smiles, FQHCs inclusion of dental services, parent oral health advocates, teledentistry , and fluoride applications during wellness visits in CHOC Children's primary care offices. Another suggestion includes grouping procedures together (i.e. dental exam, blood draws) to minimize exposure to anesthesia. 66 | P a g e Immunizations (Vaccines) and Infectious Diseases Up-to-date i mmunizations protect the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities . Key informants highlighted the importance of p ediatric physicians and their representatives in educating and protecting the public from infectious diseases. Low-rates of immunizations \u2014a sign of poor community health \u2014threaten immunocompromised individuals which is of great concern to key informants working in the Orange County education system. Some challenges that cause low -rates of immunizations include lack of partnership and collaboration with agencies and other community r esources. The barriers pertain to lack of access to medical care, high costs , and vaccine misinformation. Suggestions by key informants include collaboration between CHOC Children's and other community organizations to work together in providing public se rvice announcement s or campaigns focus ed on educati ng on the importance of having up -to-date immunizations. Collaboration and Partnership with School Programs Many of the critical health concerns , identified by key informants , noted the need for school -based involvement in the overall health and well -being of children in Orange County . School -based support programs can help address several identified community concerns , including : Chronic absenteeism ; Mental health ( anxiety and depression ); Obesity ; Respiratory illnesses (asthma and allergies) ; Substance abuse (vaping) ; and Bullying and stressors . School -based programs a re a means of identifying , educating , and connecting students and their families with community resources to he lp build a thriving community . Access to Pediatric Specialists Another critical health need of the community is the lack of access to pediatric specialists, specifically pediatric dentists and pediatric mental health providers. Key informants define access through reimbursement coverage ; the number of providers supplying services; physical location of providers ; hours of operati ng and scheduling; and language barriers. Access to pediatric specialist s is a national challenge . Child Poverty Child p overty and its consequences was another community health need identified by key informants . Poverty creates barriers to resources that affects health improvement and promotion. Poverty is often associated with problems such as lack of child care and neglect , poor education , and hunger. Key informants believe more should be done to assist families living in poverty within Orange County \u2014a metropol itan area described as affluent. Some key informants also mentioned that community -based education, poor environmental quality, unaffordable and unstable housing, and lack of partnership and collaboration of community assets are all barriers to addressing poverty within Orange County. 67 | P a g e Child Care Affordability Affordable child care was identified by many key informants as a critical health concern , especially for the low - income and underserved population. The cost of raising a child (inclusive of day care and education) is increasing and is impacting families across all populations in Orange County . Families are prioritizing child care spending over other necessities such as housing, medical insurance , and car maintenance . The cost of child care in California , and particularly Orange County, is more expensive than that in other states . Child care affordability is a concern that exacerbates other community health issues , including mental health services, oral hea lth services , and obesity. To overcome this barrier, key informants suggest identifying additional resources that can alleviate the burden of rising child care costs. Another suggestion is to place more effort in collaborating and partnering with school pr ograms and other community organizations, especially those that help with food access and job employment . Housing Affordability As identified by secondary resources a nd informant key interviews and surveys, it has been noted that housing affordability in Orange County has becom e a burden to low-income and medically underserved populations. Key informants believe housing prices have led to increased commute times and lower quality of life. Key informants identified housing affordability as a barrier when addressing critical health needs, such as mental health services, obesity, and respiratory illnesses. Additionally, key informants suggest improved collaboration and partnership with local agencies and community organizations could help address this community need. 68 | P a g e APPENDIX A: DATA SOURCES American Academy of Pediatrics (2019).
