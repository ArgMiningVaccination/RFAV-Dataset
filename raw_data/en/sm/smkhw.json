In the early 1990s, Sonia and Khachadour Atikian of Toronto, Canada were prosecuted for failing to provide the necessities of life for their daughter Lorie, who had died in 1987 at the age of 17 months. Courtroom testimony indicated that the child had died of pneumonia and malnutrition after being kept on a meager diet. Mrs. Atikian maintained that she was following the advice of Gerhard Hanswille, a local herbalist who claimed his recommended products and practices could help make Lorie a \"super baby.\" The Atikians had emigrated from Lebanon and Syria to Canada and had two teenaged children in addition to Lorie. Their cultural background may have made them a bit more vulnerable than the average parent, but, like many people, they were concerned about modern food additives, pesticide residues, and drugs and held positive attitudes toward \"natural\" food and medicine. Hanswille said that he learned herbology in Germany through self-study and books and had obtained a doctoral degree in naturopathy from Bernadean University in 1972. He owned two \"House of Herbs\" stores in Toronto. He also gave seminars at which he expounded his theories, which included making wax and clay effigies sealed with drops of blood and sperm (notions founded in Monism and Vitalism which are the basis of most primitive folk medicine). A book he wrote describes how to heal diabetes, epilepsy, tuberculosis, tumors, and paralysis by \"touchless massage.\" Hanswille likened the technique to dowsing for water, something that \"not everyone can do.\" Sonia paid $450 to one of his courses. [Bernadean University](https://quackwatch.org/consumer-education/nonrecorg/bernadean/) was a nonaccredited correspondence school that was never approved or accredited to offer any courses and was closed down by the Nevada Commission on Postsecondary Education in 1976. Hanswille had no license that entitled him to dispense medical advice. Nevertheless, his vision of natural health made a convert of Sonia. When she became pregnant with Lorie in 1985, Hanswille convinced her to remain \"pure\" for the sake of the child. She testified that Hanswille promised to make Lorie a super baby who would be \"very different,\" would \"develop without chemicals\" and would be strong, pure, and \"very special.\" Hanswille convinced Sonia that vaccinations would \"poison\" her child and that ultrasound examination would damage an unborn baby's brain. He had Sonia tell her pediatrician that she would not be bringing Lorie in any more because the family was moving to California. Hanswille was described as \"like a doctor. . . surrounded by medicine and books. . . sure of what he was saying. He always had an answer.\" Hanswille advocated an organic, vegetarian diet. He sold the Atikians a juicer for $400 after alleging that their own juicer \"burned the nutrition\" out of fruits. Among the products the Atikians purchased from Hanswille were a bottle of baby oil that cost $16, a bar of soap costing $7.40, and a 3 kg box of laundry detergent that cost $35.99. When Lorie became ill she was treated with royal jelly, \"cell salts,\" and an herbal concoction brewed by Hanswille. He also treated her with an electromagnetic \"vitalizing\" device that \"stimulates the blood\" and had attachments such as an electrified comb that was said to \"liven up\" the hair. Sonia Atikian testified that they became very concerned about Lorie's condition but that Hanswille assured them that it was normal for clumps of her baby's hair to fall out and not to worry if Lorie didn't gain weight. Hanswille told Sonia that taking Lorie to a hospital would be like \"holding a loaded gun to Lorie's head and pulling the trigger.\" After Lorie died, the Atikians were charged with failing to provide the necessities of life for their baby daughter (child neglect) Hanswille was not charged. The Atikians were tried three times. During the first trial, [Hanswille admitted that on the day before Lorie died, he had treated her with the \"electromagnetic\" device and advised wrapping her in cabbage leaves](https://cdn.centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2020/11/22170755/hanswill_testimony.pdf). But he denied influencing Mrs. Atikian against standard treatment and said he had told her to seek medical advice. He complained angrily that he felt like \"the accused,\" but denied that he did anything wrong. He said that he never tells people what to do and that it is up to the parents to make decisions for their children. The judge instructed the jury that it was all right for them to \"vent your spleen\" over the activities of Hanswille \"and his ilk,\" but neither he nor herbalism were on trial in the death of little Lorie. The Atikian's defense was centered around the assertion that they had provided the \"necessaries of life\" when they followed Hanswille's advice. The first jury found Atikians guilty of child neglect, and the judge sentenced them to two years in prison. However, the verdict was overturned by an appeals court. To reach its finding of guilt, the jury had concluded that the Atikians could not possibly have believed that they were providing what Lorie needed. [The appeals court disagreed and overturned the verdict](https://cdn.centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2021/04/22173353/atikian_appeal.pdf). A second trial was held and ended in a mistrial because the jurors culd not agree on a verdict. During the third trial, it was found that the prosecutors had withheld an important investigative report that supported the Atikians' \"honest belief\" defense. When this came out, the judge dismissed the case. During the first trial, [one witness described how Hanswille's self-confidentce helped persuade her father to undergo treatment with him for cancer](http://centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/quackwatch/hanswille.pdf): The herbalist was a very impressive man. He just glowed with health and was very charismatic, very jovial, charming, friendly, very nice, very knowledge-able. There was not a question that you could ask that he would not have an answer for. And he told a lot of stories about people who had come to see him and been cured by following his course of treatment. It's a very difficult thing to communicate just how mesmerizing this man was. He was so good, so positive. He just exuded this powerful aura about him. He told my father that his cancer was completely curable. He had to change his diet because this was the cause of the cancer. He would have to eat strictly fruits and vegetables, raw, or juices of those fruits and vegetables, and by doing this, the tumor would be dissolved. When my father lost weight, the herbalist said this was just the body ridding itself of toxins and poisons. During his final two weeks, my father developed a hole near his rectum and a lesion that grew bigger each day. The herbalist said it was just the radiation coming out, which was a good thing. I now know it was a gangrenous tumor. I look back now and can't believe that I fell under this man's spell . The story of Lorie's death received extensive coverage in Canada by the Toronto Star and The Globe and Mail. In cases like this, many people blame of the parents for their gullibility and wonder how they could be so foolish. The reality is that many people believe the underlying assumptions that condemn modern food and commercial agriculture and extol \"natural\" medicine. The herbal industry tried to distance itself from Hanswille by saying that the case was \"not typical.\" However, what Hanswille told the Atikians is not only widely believed by health food and natural (herbal) medicine ilk; it largely represents the philosophy that is used to justify the existence of \"alternative\" medicine and herbalism. The Atikians certainly used poor judgment, but it appeared to me that the primary culprit was Hanswille who represented himself as a skilled professional, which he was not. In 1962, a California chiropractor was convicted of second-degree murder by words alone in the death of 11-year-old cancer patient, Linda Epping. To get a conviction, the prosecutor had to prove that \"his fraudulent representations ... caused Linda to die when she died.\" I do not know whether Hanswille could have been similarly prosecuted under Canadian law. I believe that people who presume to give health advice that can make the difference between life and death should be regulated by the government and held accountable for their misdeeds. It is clear that the state has a compelling responsibility to protect vulnerable people\u2014and their children\u2014from the glib purveyors of pseudomedicine. It doesn't matter whether such practitioners are sincere in their beliefs because, when it comes to quackery, zealotry can be just as dangerous as fraud.

Goebbels did this to keep the civilians happy because as soon as a war could be arranged, the real doctors were going to be sent off to tend the troops. The Nazis conducted tests and actually realized that practical healing didn't work.

By creating the profession of heilpraktikers (\"practical healers\"), Hitler and his Nazi colleagues played a major role in initiating what is now called \"alternative medicine\" in Germany. Goebbels did this to keep the civilians happy because as soon as a war could be arranged, the real doctors were going to be sent off to tend the troops. The Nazis conducted tests and actually realized that practical healing didn't work. Goebbels' law, as well as legitimizing its practitioners, was intended to prohibit further training so that their numbers would dwindle after the war ended. However, in 1957 they got a court judgment overturning this restriction. Rusting greenhouses with broken windows stand near the electrified barbed wire fence of Hitler's death camp just north of Munich. Beds for plants are barely visible in the long grass. An old rake still leans against the oven where the medicinal herbs were dried. This was the Nazis' experimental herb garden at the concentration camp Dachau, a relic of their support for what has been successively known as holistic, alternative, complementary and integrative medicine [1]. Here, in addition to conducting grisly medical experiments on the inmates, the Nazis tested herbal remedies. This huge plantation was part of the Nazis attempt to cut medical costs in preparation for the war they were intending to start. Its 150 hectares (370 acres) comprised the largest garden for medicinal herbs in Europe. The beds held gladioli, peppergrass, chili, blackcurrant, sage, thyme and hundreds of others [2]. By systematically testing about a thousand varieties of plants, the Nazis hoped to find remedies for minor ailments that would be cheaper than drugs. Homeopathy, with its miniscule amounts of the supposedly active ingredients, sounded like an especially promising way to cut costs. And, of course, slave labor made it cheaper still. Even better, these thrifty herbal cures needn't be prescribed by doctors. The low-cost workforce of traditional healers could do the job. This motley crew already prescribed plant extracts, homeopathic potions, and water cures, taking advantage of the widespread belief in alternatives to conventional medicine in Germany during the 1930s. At that time about half a million Germans were formally enrolled in health clubs devoted to spreading these questionable cures, and this was just the tip of an iceberg of believers [3]. Even today, there are about 600 clubs, with more than 160,000 members, preaching the health doctrines of just a single one of these\u2014the treatments prescribed by the 19th-century Bavarian priest, Sebastian Kneipp [4]. Father Kneipp began his medical mission after he became convinced that he had cured his own tuberculosis by icy dips in the Danube in winter. These popular beliefs, if cleverly promoted, could be of use to the Nazis. And to make the Germans even more receptive to these low-cost cures, the Nazis set about to demonize scientific medicine. It was, they claimed, a plot by \"Jewish doctors.\" Of course, Jews were, indeed, overrepresented in medicine. A fifth of the doctors in Germany were of Jewish origin, and in Vienna it was well over half. This was related to centuries of persecution. Historically, medicine had been the only profession open to Jews, as this placed them in the front lines in battling the plagues of the Middle Ages. Someone had to do the dangerous job, and Jews were expendable [5]. The Nazis' creeping restrictions on Jewish doctors began right after their rise to power in Germany in 1933. They were expelled from the universities, forbidden to practice, and finally driven out of the country or killed. After Germany annexed Austria in 1938, the process was repeated there. The Medical Faculty in Vienna was \"cleansed\" of three quarters of its instructors, nearly all for having Jewish ancestry. Their colleagues who remained voiced little opposition [5]. The disappearance of the Jewish doctors lessened the competition for academic posts at the university and the competition for patients in the city. But if the remaining doctors thought they were now freed of competition, they were mistaken. In 1937 the Nazis disbanded the doctors' professional organizations and placed them under the control of the government. The groups of folk healers faced the same fate, but for them state control was an upward step, for it was accompanied by recognition as part of the medical profession. Now the real doctors found themselves on the same footing as herbalists, homeopaths, and apostles of Father Kneipp's water cures [3] Even in some hospitals the doctors were obliged to bow to the practices of their newly-recognized \"colleagues.\" In Stuttgart a whole hospital was run according to homeopathic doctrines. And at the Rudolf Hess Hospital in Dresden patients were treated with diet, fasting, and water cures. But the doctors didn't dare object. In the opening ceremony in Dresden in 1934 they were given a warning: \"If any colleagues, with the arrogance of scientific medicine, intend to look down upon the [alternative]. healers, these gentlemen would be well advised to seek a different profession.\" [3] Though bullying could silence the skeptics, it couldn't alter the facts. For three years, from 1936 until the war broke out, the Nazis cultivated the herb garden at Dachau, but their large-scale experiment didn't yield the hoped-for alternative to the scientific pharmacy. They couldn't find any scientific basis for the herbal treatments, and when the potions were tested clinically the results were so disappointing that they were never published [3] Despite this setback, the Nazis were determined to foster the faith of the German population in the alternative healers. These were needed to keep the civilians happy \u00e2\u20ac\" because as soon as a war could be arranged, most of the real doctors were going to be sent away to care for the soldiers. And so, six months before the Nazis invaded Poland, Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Minister of Propaganda, introduced a law to turn the folk healers into a recognized profession. He gave them a new title, \"Heilpraktiker\" (\"practical healer\") and admitted them into the German health system. However, a clause in the 1939 law reveals what Goebbels really thought of the profession he had created. After victory had been achieved and the real doctors returned from the front, Goebbels didn't want this swarm of incompetents underfoot. So the law forbade the training of any new heilpraktikers [6]. This was meant to ensure that after the war they would fade away. Goebbels is claimed to have said, \"This law is both their cradle and their grave.\"[7]. In East Germany, they did indeed dwindle away after the war, exactly as Goebbels had intended. However, in West Germany the new political system came to their rescue. A F\u00c3\u00bchrer can do things by fiat, but a parliament must act according to law. This saved the heilpraktikers, who in 1957 were able to argue successfully before the West German Supreme Court that in a democracy you cannot forbid people to train for a perfectly legal profession. This ruling ensured their continued existence and the New Age movement that followed ensured their growth. To those searching for spirituality the heilpraktikers offered treatments that were \"in harmony with Nature and the Cosmos.\" Between 1970 and 1989 their number in West Germany more than trebled. And after that, German reunification enabled them to expand into the eastern part of the country [8]. Once the alternative healers gained a legal foothold, their growth was pretty well assured. Unlike doctors, the heilpraktikers proselytize constantly. Even the \"health\" courses offered by the adult education centers in Germany today are mostly delivered by alternative healers, who use them to advertise for patients. Yet the participants still pay fees to attend these courses and the taxpayers subsidize them, as well. These \"education\" courses give the heilpraktikers a platform from which to air their views on the virtues of alternative medicine and the vices of the evidence-based sort. They consider themselves far more knowledgeable and they feel it is their mission to spread the Truth. Theirs is a struggle against the forces of evil, in the form of science-based medicine, which some of them claim is \"the leading cause of death.\"[9]. Added to this sense of righteousness is the heady feeling of being leaders on the scientific frontier. After all, only they understand medicine's spiritual dimension. The irony of opposing science while claiming to be on the leading edge of science is lost on them. Alternative healers also get the chance to push their product during consultations. They can afford to spend far more time with a patient than a doctor because their time is worth considerably less. And many are, indeed, superb salespeople, appealing to vanity, exploiting hopes and fears, turning customers into salespeople and wielding a whole arsenal of clinical tricks [10]. The very nature of many illnesses helps their cause. When improvement occurs, patients fail to attribute this to the placebo effect or to the natural ups and downs of many chronic illnesses, or for a variety of other reasons [11]. The high demand for the services of these alternative healers and the ease of entry into this field makes it a popular profession. If you want to become a heilpraktiker the only educational requirement is graduation from primary school. After that you can try the admission test, whose written part consists of sixty multiple-choice questions. This one is my favorite: \"If the patient is in a coma, can you wake him up by shouting at him? Ja or nein?\"[12]. In case you have difficulty with this, don't worry, you can retake the test as often as you like. After all, you have no obligation to actually cure anyone: the stated aim of this examination is merely to ensure that you \"do not pose a danger to the public health.\" [13] Once you've gotten through this exam\u2014if necessary, on your umpteenth try\u2014you are then let loose to offer medical treatment to the German public. There you will encounter very few restrictions. The main constraints are that heilpraktikers can't perform surgery, deliver babies or try to treat communicable diseases [14]. (Of course, there's no assurance that they would recognize a communicable diseases if they encounter them.) Yet, oddly enough it's not just medical laymen who become heilpraktikers. In Germany, as in other countries, alternative medicine is now so widely accepted that sometimes even scientifically trained doctors get \"converted.\" Those who should know better can find it profitable to ignore any doubts. A doctor who supplements his evidence-based medicine with alternative treatments is seen by many patients as having an additional specialty. This easy-to-acquire additional \"qualification\" is often used to burnish the credentials of women doctors returning after maternity leave and struggling to re-establish a practice. All of this means that when you go to a new doctor in Germany you can never be sure what awaits you. That became clear after I made an appointment with a German specialist in sports medicine, someone with at least six years of scientific medicine under his belt. I presented myself to the doctor with what I thought was an obvious problem: ever since lifting something far too heavy, my back had been hurting. But it wasn't clear to him. He was determined not to merely treat my \"symptoms\"\u2014he intended to seek out the underlying cause. So after poking around a bit, Herr Doktor announced that the real problem was that my pelvis was in the wrong position. He broke the news of this major anatomical malformation with remarkable cheerfulness. No problem, he assured me\u2014he could flip my pelvis back again. All he needed to do was perform a manipulation on my neck. Yes, this fellow wanted to perform a totally unnecessary treatment, despite the risk of injury, on a part of my body that was unrelated to my symptoms. Of course, from his point of view something \"natural\" like a manipulation must be risk-free. He seemed to have forgotten (along with the rest of what he had learned in medical school) that the most common serious \"side effect\" of a neck manipulation is damage to the artery leading to the brain\u2014and this can lead to a stroke [15, 16]. This medical comedy routine was beginning to sound dangerous, and I shuffled out of his office as fast as I could go. But what if I had been less skeptical and my complaint had been more serious? In Germany nearly two-thirds of the people diagnosed by doctors as having cancer turn up eventually at the door of a heilpraktiker [17]. And that doesn't count those who visit a properly accredited doctor, as I did, who turns out to be a quack. Furthermore, the face-to-face consultations with alternative healers will be only a fraction of the virtual visits made though their websites. A survey of about 30 of these sites turned up 118 different fake cancer \"cures.\" Some of these sites even advise cancer patients to ignore standard medical advice and skip the recommended chemotherapy and radiation treatments [18]. When desperation finally drives the patients of the alternative healers back to the real doctors, it can be too late. Adolf Hitler is second only to Josef Stalin as the undisputed, all-time, world champion of killers. But Hitler's death at the war's end did not end his influence. His cynical promotion of alternative healers has had lasting results worldwide. Even today Hitler's legacy of quack medicine is still costing lives. References - Salzberg S.

In 2011, [the board charged Raymond Della Porta, Sr., D.M.D., of Vero Beach, Florida, with providing substandard care](http://www.casewatch.net/board/dent/della_porta/complaint_2011.pdf) based on his use of Sargenti cement in two patients. The board's action was triggered by a complaint from a Sargenti critic who called attention to a statement by Della Porta that he had used the Sargenti system for 35 years and had treated over 5,000 cases. In 2012, Della Porta and the board signed a [settlement agreement](http://www.casewatch.net/board/dent/della_porta/settlement.shtml) under which the board would issue a letter of concern and order him to (a) pay a $5,000 fine, (b) refund out-of-pocket fees and costs to the patients, and (c) permanently refrain from using Sargenti material in endodontic procedures. Shortly after the agreement was signed, however, Della Porta filed a motion for reconsideration which noted that he had practiced for nearly 44 years without disciplinary action, had stopped using the Sargenti material, and had reimbursed the two patients as agreed. [The board then vacated its order and dismissed the complaint](http://www.casewatch.net/board/dent/della_porta/final_order_2012.pdf). After the case ended, Lorrie Kruse, a Sargenti critic who believes that the board was too lenient, sent e-mail requests to several enforcement officials asking that more be done. Della Porta responded by suing Kruse for defamation, but the suit backfired. In December 2013, he withdrew it and agreed to pay an undisclosed sum in return for Kruse's pledge that she would not sue him for malicious prosecution or other grounds related to the case. Fake doctor convicted of practicing medicine without a license. A San Diego jury has found Keith Allen Barton, 51, guilty of six felony counts of treating patients without a medical license, one count of false personation, and three counts related to grand theft. According to the District Attorney's news release: - Barton is not licensed as a medical doctor, osteopath, or naturopath but shares his name with a real medical doctor who is licensed in California. Barton used the fact that only his middle name differed from the real Dr. Barton to create the impression that he was a licensed professional. - Barton promised to cure a woman and her children of HIV. One of the children subsequently died as a result of not receiving effective treatment. The victim paid Barton $18,000 for the treatment. - Barton also advised a woman with autoimmune disease to surgically extract all of her teeth and to take an ineffective treatment called \"dendritic cellular therapy.\" This victim paid Barton more than $32,000 for his remedies. - Barton also offered to treat cancer patients. - The jury announced its verdict after two days of deliberations. Barton faces up to eight years and 10 months in local prison at sentencing on February 10. Barton did business as the International Holistic Health Clinic in La Mesa, California. [Cancer Treatment Watch has an additional victim report](http://www.cancertreatmentwatch.org/reports/barton.shtml). Chiropractic groups disclaim interest in prescribing drugs. The [Chiropractic Summit](http://donotlink.com/www.chirosummit.org/), a consortium of 40 of chiropractic's leading organizations, has issued the following statement: The drug issue is a non-issue because no chiropractic organization in the Summit promotes the inclusion of prescription drug rights and all chiropractic organizations in the Summit support the drug-free approach to health care. Some chiropractors have argued that the ability to manage patients would be enhanced if chiropractors could prescribe pain-relieving drugs. But others\u2014apparently comprising a majority\u2014believe that the use of drugs would violate basic chiropractic principles, and some have expressed concern that including drug use within chiropractic's scope might enable chiropractors to be held legally responsible for meeting medical standards.

The emergency order (shown below) indicates that early in 2012, Babcock advertised that he could reverse the effects of type II diabetes so that patients would no longer need to take medication.. He also offered free meals and free seminars during which he would market his program. The emergency order describes six cases in which Babcock acted unprofessionally and indicates that the Division had received more than 50 complaints about inappropriate billing for this program. The emergency order concludes: Respondent's unprofessional conduct . . . poses an immediate and significant danger to the pubic health, safety, and welfare, and requires immediate action by the Division. In particular, the Respondent has repeatedly taken advantage of elderly patients by promising to reverse their diabetes and scaring them into accepting the diabetes treatment by telling them that they could die, they could have their legs cut off, and they could go blind. After convincing these elderly patients, many of whom are on fixed incomes, to pay $6,000 for the treatment, the Respondent often tells these patients to either go off or cut back on their existing medications without consulting with the patients' physicians and without doing any real medical testing or examinations on the patients. This conduct endangers and exploits these elderly patients both physically and financially. The fact that the Respondent repeatedly recruits elderly patterns through advertising and free dinners to sign up for his program. and that he repeatedly either tricks or \"hard sells\" these elderly patients who are suffering from diabetes into signing up and paying for his program creates a significant and immediate danger to the public. Further, the fact that the Respondent does little to no medical testing on these elderly patients yet advises them to cut back or stop taking their existing medications creates some real health risks for these patients. Making the matter even worse is the fact that the Respondent does not have any contact with the physicians and/or health care providers for these elderly patients. Lastly, the Respondent is making medical diagnoses on some of these patients without any real medical examinations or testing. In 2013, Babcock was convicted of six third-degree felony counts of exploitation of a vulnerable adult and sentenced to six months in prison. In 2008, Babcock signed a \" [non-disciplinary cease and desist stipulation and order](http://centerforinquiry.org/quackwatch/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/quackwatch/casewatch/board/chiro/babcock/2008_stipulation.pdf)\" under which he agreed to stop advertising that he could treat various medical problems unless he became licensed to do so. Dan Lau (USB No 8233) Assistant Attorney General Mark L Shurtleff (USB No 4666) Utah Attorney General Commercial Enforcement Division 160 East 300 South. 5 Floor Box 140872 Salt Lake City, Utah 84114-0872 Telephone (801) 366-0310 BEFORE THE DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL LICENSING OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE STATE OF UTAH |IN THE MATTER OF THE LICENSE OF | BRANDON BABCOCK, CP, TO PRACTICE AS A CHIROPRACTIC PHYSICIAN IN THE STATE OF UTAH |EMERGENCY ORDER | Case No DOPL 2012-192 The Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing of the Department of Commerce of the State of Utah (the \"Division\") initiated an Emergency Adjudicative Proceeding pursuant to Utah Code Ann \u00a7 630-4-502. the Utah Administrative Procedures Act, Utah Code Ann \u00a7 58-1-108(2), the Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing Act and Utah Administrative Code R151-46b-16, the Department of Commerce Administrative Procedures Act Rules. The Division initiated the Emergency Administrative Proceeding upon evidence that the continued practice of Brandon Babcock (the \"Respondent\") as a chiropractic physician represented an immediate and significant danger to the public health, safety, and welfare, and that the threat required immediate action by the agency. Before taking this action, the Chair of the Chiropractic Physician Licensing Board appointed a three-member committee to review with the Division the proposed action in this matter, pursuant to Utah Code Ann \u00a7 58-) -108(2). Pursuant to the Open and Public Meetings Act, Utah Code Ann \u00a7 52-4-1, the Division provided notice of the meeting of the committee for 9 am on April 25, 2012. at the Heber M Wells Building located at 160 East 300 South, Salt Lake City, Utah. Notice of the Emergency Hearing was placed in the lobby of the Heber Wells Building and on the DOPL/public information website on or about Apri124, 2012. The committee convened at the appointed date and time. The meeting of the committee was closed pursuant to Utah Code Ann \u00a7 52-4-205( 1) (a) in order to discuss the professional competence and character of an individual. The presiding committee member affirmed under oath that the meeting was closed for that purpose. The committee reviewed the Division's proposed action and considered information in the form of testimony and exhibits. The Division, having considered the committee's recommendations, makes the following Findings of Fact. Conclusions of Law, and Order. FINDINGS OF FACT 1 That Since September 12. 2002, the Respondent has been licensed to practice as a chiropractor physician, license number 5189485-1202. 2 That from at least February 2012, the Respondent was advertising on both TV and through the newspapers that he could reverse the effects of type II diabetes, and that he could stop drug dependency for patients who were suffering from type II diabetes. The Respondent would also advertise free seminars and free gourmet meals where he would sell his diabetes program to reverse type II diabetes to a predominantly older crowd of people who were suffering from type II diabetes. That since April 1, 2012, the Division has received over 50 complaints on the Respondent's practice of luring elderly people into seeing him through advertising or a free dinner and then inappropriately billing these elderly people for a program that allegedly \"reverses their type II diabetes.\" That on or about April 16, 2012, the Respondent was charged in the Third District Court with ten counts of exploitation of a vulnerable adult and one count of communications fraud. Eight of these criminal charges were second degree felonies due to an aggregate value of the resources used or profits made being $5,000 or more, and three of these charges were third degree felonies due to an aggregate value of the resources used or profits made being less than $5,000. That on or about April 16, 2012, the Respondent was arrested tor the eleven criminal charges mentioned above. Even after being arrested, the Respondent informed potential customers/victims that he was still going to continue with his practice of holding promotional dinners where he was selling his type II diabetes services. As recently as April 24, 2012, the Division has heard reports that the Respondent still plans on holding his seminars and trying to lure elderly patients into paying for his diabetes program. 3 That on or about February 21, 2012, the Respondent met with BB, a 79 year old woman who suffers from type II diabetes. BB had seen an advertisement from the Respondent that he was able to reverse her diabetes. The Respondent persuaded BB into signing up for a credit card when BB thought she was just filling out patient forms. BB did not learn until later that she had signed up for a credit card through Chase Health. BB confronted the Respondent about the credit cards, telling him that she did not use credit cards and that she did not want to start using them now.The Respondent told BB to \"Just put away the card in case she needed it.\" In addition to diabetes, BB also suffered from polio and 'was still healing from a recent heart valve replacement procedure. The Respondent never asked BB about any of the medications she was taking in February 2012. In fact, the Respondent never touched BB or examined her in any way. The Respondent also never talked to any of BB 's physicians who were treating her in February 2012. BB tried to comply with the Respondent's dietary program which prohibited pork, beef and bread. The Respondent also told BB to cut back on her insulin and her diabetes medication. After two weeks on the Respondent's program. BB called the Respondent's office because her health was declining and her legs were swelling up to the point where she almost could not walk. The Respondent never called her back. BB called her primary care provider, Dr Checketts, who advised her to stop taking the supplements that were offered by the Respondent and to get back on all of her diabetes medications. The Respondent charged BB approximately $1700 for his services. BB called the Respondent and demanded a full refund because she had opted out in the first 30 days of the program. BB was so upset about the Respondent's fraudulent conduct that she did not sleep for approximately three weeks. After enlisting the aid of her nephew, BB finally got a refund on the $1700 she was wrongfully charged by the Respondent. BB was so upset over the Respondent's actions when he was trying to get BB to continue with the program that she asked him, \"What happens to the bill If I die from your program?\" The Respondent did not answer her question. 4 That on or about March 15, 2012, the Respondent met with TL , a 71 year old man who suffers from Parkinson's disease, dementia, thyroid problems and diabetes, at one of the Respondent's \"free dinner\" seminars. On March 15. TL signed what he thought was a contract for the Respondent's services. TL believed the contract stated that he could opt out of the payments and the Respondent's program if he chose to do so in the first 30 days. TL asked the Respondent how his program was going to affect TL s Parkinson's disease. TL lived in a care center with strict dietary controls for residents, so he quickly realized that he could not comply with the Respondent's inner cleansing techniques. On March 19, 2012. TL 's daughter, AN. called the Respondent's office and requested a refund for her father. The Respondent's office staff informed AN that TL would still have to pay a $500 cancellation fee and the fees for the supplement, and that TL was still responsible for the $6,000 charge with Chase Bank. AN informed the Respondent's staff that her father had not even used the supplements, and that the supplements were still tn their original bags. AN also contacted Chase Bank, which was the financial institution affiliated with the Respondent's services contract. Chase Bank told AN to fax a formal letter, disputing the $6000 charge. AN did fax Chase Bank the dispute letter, but Chase Bank refused to Issue AN a refund and told her that she would \"have to deal with the provider.\" 5 That on or about March 2012, the Respondent met with DO, a 65 year old man who suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol in November of 2010, DO had open heart surgery due to numerous health problems. While meeting with DO, the Respondent told DO that he could get DO off all of his medications, including his heart medication. The Respondent informed DO that his program normally cost $6,000, but he would accept $5400 from DO if DO paid in cash. The Respondent then sent DO two test kits in the mail, a saliva sample DNA lest and a stool sample test. The Respondent informed DO that these two tests alone cost almost $2,000. DO believed the Respondent was an MD who specialized in endocrinology. DO asked the Respondent about the results from these two tests. The Respondent refused to discuss the results of the tests with DO. The Respondent also refused to give DO any information on any kind of chat room with other patients who were following the Respondent's diabetes program. After about five months into the program, the Respondent told DO to stop taking his Simvastatin medicine and to reduce his Metformin. DO followed the Respondent's instructions and was tested a month later by his VA doctors. DO's VA doctors informed DO that his newest blood test results were worse than they had ever been. They Informed DO that he was in a very dangerous condition\u2014especially with regard to his cholesterol. The VA nurse practitioner advised DO to Immediately get back on all of his originally prescribed medications. After learning that the Respondent's program was actually making him sicker. DO called the Respondent and informed him of this fact. The Respondent told DO, \"Not to worry Your body is just going through a change,\" DO asked the Respondent for a refund because the Respondent had promised that DO's diabetes would be reversed and u had not been reversed. The Respondent told DO that there would be no refund. The Respondent never spoke to any of DO's doctors or health care providers at the VA and never did any kind of testing on DO except for the spit DNA test and the stool test. DO felt cheated by the entire process and does not want to see other elderly folks cheated by the Respondent. 6 That on or about September 23, 2011, TH, a 69 year old man on a fixed income who suffers from diabetes, met with the Respondent at one of the Respondent's dinner presentations. TH was looking for a way to get his blood sugar under control. The Respondent promised TH that if he signed up for the program, \"TH would cut his insulin down or completely out\" within three months. TH informed the Respondent that he was skeptical about the $6,000 cost because he was on a fixed income. The Respondent reassured TH that TH would actually be cutting costs because TH would not be taking as many medication.s The Respondent did not examine TH. The Respondent had three meetings with TH that totaled one hour. At the end of December 2011. TH was out of supplements and called the Respondent. The Respondent was not available at the time. After TH threatened to sue, the Respondent's office agreed to extend his treatment for three additional months, but TH would be required to pay any additional charges. On or about March 14, 2011, TH was admitted to the hospital for 11 days because his kidneys had failed and he had pneumonia. The physician at the hospital told TH that he needed to get off the diet from the Respondent's plan and stop taking all of the supplements. TH called the Respondent's office and asked for a refund of his $5,000. After some bickering from both sides, the Respondent's office refused to refund the $5,000 to TH. During the entire time, TH was following the Respondent's program, he believed that the Respondent was a doctor. 7 On or about March 8, 2012, the Respondent met with RK, an 83 year old man who suffers from diabetes. The Respondent made the following statements to RK when he was trying to persuade RK to pay for his treatment \"Do you want to have your foot cut off?\" \"Do you want to go blind while driving?' The Respondent told RK that he could reverse his diabetes and get his blood sugar levels down to 110. The Respondent also told RK that he could get RK off all of his diabetic medications. The Respondent tried to get RK to sign up for the $6,000 treatment program, but RK refused. RK cut the Respondent a check for $500. After RK got home that night, he decided he would not participate in the Respondent's program and called the Respondent, asking for a refund because the first consultation was supposed to be free. The Respondent told RK that he would have to come back into the office for an exit interview in order to get his refund. RK refused to come back for the exit interview, and he has not received a refund from the Respondent. 8 On or about January 2012, DZ , an elderly lady who suffers from diabetes, met with the Respondent after she had seen the Respondent's advertising that he could reverse her diabetes. The Respondent did not perform any medical tests on DZ during their mural consultation, but he concluded that DZ had Hashimoto's disease and leaky gut. DZ reluctantly decided to sign up for the program, but the next day she called the Respondent and informed him that she was going to cancel her treatment program. The Respondent became angry and informed DZ that she would have to come in for an exit interview. At the exit interview, the Respondent told DZ and her husband that she could try the program and see if it worked or pay him a $500 cancellation fee. DZ decided to try the program. DZ asked the Respondent about medical testing to see if the program was working. The Respondent informed DZ that he would know if it was working. The Respondent also sent DZ a spit DNA test and a stool test. The Respondent went on to tell DZ that she had Hashimoto's disease and a stomach bacteria. The Respondent did not make weekly calls to DZ , which was promised at the onset of the treatment program, and DZ informed the Respondent that she was suffering from swollen legs and cramps. The Respondent told DZ to eat more fish without doing any kind of medical examinations on DZ. DZ 's blood glucose levels are still climbing, and she now is stuck with paying a $6,000 credit card bill. CONCLUSIONS FROM THE FACTS 1 That the Respondent's unprofessional conduct as described above poses an immediate and significant danger to the pubic health, safety, and welfare, and requires immediate action by the Division. Inparticular, the Respondent has repeatedly taken advantage of elderly patients by promising to reverse their diabetes and scaring them into accepting the diabetes treatment by telling them that they could die, they could have their legs cut off, and they could go blind. After convincing these elderly patients, many of whom are on fixed incomes, to pay $6,000 for the treatment, the Respondent often tells these patients to either go off or cut back on their existing medications without consulting with the patients' physicians and without doing any real medical testing or examinations on the patients. This conduct endangers and exploits these elderly patients both physically and financially. The fact that the Respondent repeatedly recruits elderly patterns through advertising and free dinners to sign up for his program. and that he repeatedly either tricks or \"hard sells\" these elderly patients who are suffering from diabetes into signing up and paying for his program creates a significant and immediate danger to the public. Further, the fact that the Respondent does little to no medical testing on these elderly patients yet advises them to cut back or stop taking their existing medications creates some real health risks for these patients. Making the matter even worse is the fact that the Respondent does not have any contact with the physicians and/or health care providers for these elderly patients. Lastly. the Respondent is making medical diagnoses on some of these patients without any real medical examinations or testing. All of the previously mentioned behavior constitutes an immediate threat to the public health. safety, and welfare since the Respondent has built and is actively using a systemic program that tends to cheat, exploit and endanger both the physical and fiscal health of elderly patients who are already suffering from type II diabetes. 2 The Division finds that, pursuant to Utah Code Ann \u00a7 58-1-40 I (2)(a), there is a factual basis to conclude that the Respondent has engaged in unprofessional, that he poses an immediate and significant danger/threat to the public health, safety, and welfare, and that the Division should take immediate action to suspend and/or revoke his professional licenses. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1 The Division has jurisdiction and authority to act in this matter and has followed appropriate statutory procedures regarding the initiation of emergency adjudicative actions. 2 Utah Code Ann \u00a7 63G-4-502 provides (1) An agency may issue an order on an emergency basis without complying with the requirements of this chapter if (a) the facts known by the agency or presented to the agency show that an Immediate and significant danger to the public health, safety, or welfare exists, and (b) the threat requires immediate action by the agency (2) In issuing Its emergency order, the agency shall (a) limit its order to require only the action necessary to prevent or avoid the danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, (b) issue promptly a written order, effective immediately, that Includes a brief statement of findings of fact, conclusions of law, and reasons for the agency's utilization of emergency adjudicative proceedings, and (c) give immediate notice to the persons who are required to comply with the order. (3) If the emergency order Issued under this section will result in the continued infringement or impairment of any legal right or interest of any party, the agency shall commence a formal adjudicative proceeding in accordance with the other provisions of this chapter. 3 The actions of the Respondent constitute an Immediate and significant danger to the public health, safety, and welfare, and require immediate action to protect the public health, safety, and welfare 4 That the Respondent has engaged in unprofessional conduct as defined in Utah Code Ann \u00a7 58-1-501(2)(a), (b), (d), (g) and (k) 5 That the Respondent, by victimizing elderly individuals who are already suffering from health problems, and by putting them at further physical and financial risk by advising them to go off their medications and by charging them large sums of money for his services has engaged in unprofessional conduct as defined tn Utah Code Ann \u00a7 58-1-501(2)(a), (b), (d), (g) and (k) 6 That this Order is necessary to prevent harm to the public pending a formal adjudication of the matters addressed in this proceeding Immediate action is necessary, and this Order is the least restrictive action needed to prevent or avoid the danger to the public health, safety, or welfare. 7 The Respondent may challenge the Order pursuant to Utah Admin Code R151-46b-16 as follows R 151-46b-16 Emergency Adjudicative Proceedings Unless otherwise provided by statute or rule. (1) When a division commences an emergency adjudicative proceeding and Issues an order in accordance with Section 63G-4-502 which results in a continued impairment of the affected party's rights or legal interests, the division that issued the emergency order shall schedule a hearing upon written request of the affected party to determine whether the emergency order should be affirmed, set aside, or modified based on the standards set forth in Section 63G-4-502. The hearing will be conducted m conformity with Section 630-4-206. (2) Upon request for a hearing pursuant to this rule, the Division conduct a hearing as soon as reasonably practical but not later than 20 days from the receipt of a written request unless the Division and the party requesting the hearing agree to conduct the hearing at a later date. The Division shall have the burden of proof to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the requirements of Section 6JG-4-502 have been met. (3) Except as otherwise provided by statute, the division director or his designee shall select an individual or body of individuals to act as the presiding officer at the hearing. The presiding officer shall not include any individual who directly participated in issuing the emergency order. (4) Within a reasonable time after the hearing, the presiding officer shall Issue an order m accordance with the requirements of Section 63G-4-502. The order of the presiding officer shall be considered final agency action with respect to the emergency adjudicative proceeding and shall be subject to agency review in accordance with Section R151-46b-12. ORDER The license of Brandon Babcock to practice as a chiropractic physician in the State of Utah, license number 5189485-1202. will be immediately suspended until a hearing can be convened pursuant to Utah Code Ann \u00a7 630-4-502 and Utah Admin Code R151-46b-16, and a contravening order is issued. The Division will proceed with a formal adjudicative proceeding to uphold this suspension and/or revoke the Respondent's professional licenses. The Respondent shall immediately cease and desist from his practice as a chiropractic physician in the State of Utah until a hearing can be convened pursuant to Utah Code Ann \u00a7 63G- 4-502 and Utah Admin Code R151-46b-16. and a contravening order is issued. RIGHT TO REVIEW I In accordance with Utah Admin Code R151-46b-16, the Division will schedule a hearing Upon receipt of a written request from the Respondent At the hearing It will be determined whether this Emergency Order should be affirmed, set aside. or modified, based on the standards set forth in Utah Code Ann \u00a7 63G-4-502 The hearing will be conducted in conformity with Utah Code Ann \u00a7 63G-4-206. 2 Upon receipt of a request for hearing pursuant to Utah Adrrun Code R151-46b-16. the Division will conduct a hearing as soon as reasonably practical, but not later than twenty (20) days from receipt of a written request, unless the Division and the party requesting the hearing agree to conduct the hearing at a later date.

It summarizes scientific reports; legislative developments; Web site evaluations; recommended and nonrecommended books; and other information relevant to consumer protection and consumer decision-making. Fluoridation statistics updated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released the latest [fluoridation statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/statistics/2012stats.htm), which show that in 2012, 210 million people (74.6% of the U.S. population on community water systems) had access to optimally fluoridated water.

The jurisdictions with the highest percentage of recipients are the District of Columbia (100%), Kentucky (99.9%), Minnesota (99.8%), Illinois (98.5%), and Maryland (97.2%). The lowest are Hawaii (10.8%), New Jersey (14.6%), and Oregon (22.6%). Sylvia Browne dies. Sylvia Browne, who predicted that she herself would live to age 88, died in November at the age of 77. Throughout her career as a \"psychic,\" Browne claimed to diagnose health problems, communicate with the dead, sense what happened to missing persons, and even to have proven there is an afterlife. Critics have pointed out that (a) Browne took money\u2014under false pretenses\u2014from people who were emotionally vulnerable, (b) by inventing messages from or about lost loved ones, she could tarnish the true memories of these people, and (c) her medical diagnoses could lead people who trusted her to pursue incorrect diagnoses, waste money ruling them out, and/or ignore the advice of their own medical professionals. Browne's popularity was due in large part to her frequent appearances on the Montel Williams TV show, where she made predictions, answered questions about people's dead relatives, diagnosed health problems, and gave treatment advice to callers. Skeptics who tracked and evaluated her predictions have found that her accuracy rate was extremely poor. [In one study that recently came to light](http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/browne_test.html), 31 fourth-grade students were asked to predict the outcome of eleven things that Browne has predicted for 2005. Browne was correct in only 3 of the 11 cases (27%), which was about half of what would be expected by pure guessing. One student made 8 correct predictions, five got 7 correct, nine got 6 correct, six got 5 correct, seven got 4 correct, two got 3 correct, and one got 2 correct. (In other words, 28 out of 31 did better than Browne, two did the same, and only one did worse.) [Quackwatch has published a comprehensive report on Browne's activities](http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/browne.html). FDA warns against nipple aspirate test. The FDA has issued a \" [Consumer Update](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/nipple_aspirate_test.pdf)\" to warn that a nipple aspirate test is not a replacement for mammography, other breast imaging tests, or breast biopsy, and should not be used by itself to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. The device is a type of pump used to collect fluid from a woman's breast that is examined for the presence of abnormal cells. Some manufacturers have claimed that the test can detect precancerous abnormalities and diagnose breast cancer before mammography with just a sample of a few cells. However, there is no scientific evidence that the test by itself is an effective screening tool. In February 2013, [the FDA ordered Atossa Genetics, Inc. to correct violations in the marketing of its breast aspirate test system](http://www.casewatch.net/fdawarning/prod/2013/atossa.shtml). In October 2013, Atossa initiated a voluntary recall to remove it from the marketplace. Chiropractor jailed for conning patients. Chiropractor Brandon Lee Babcock has been convicted of six third-degree felony counts of exploiting a vulnerable adult and sentenced to six months in prison. The Salt Lake Tribune, which has followed his activities closely for several years, has noted: - Babcock's scheme hinged on tricking people into signing papers that established lines of credit with Chase Health Advance and then maxing out the $6,000 limit when patients tried to withdraw from Babcock's services. - Potential patients were initially treated to a free gourmet dinner where they were shown video testimonials and given information about the chiropractor's \"diabetes breakthrough.\" - Some patients testified that when they expressed interest, Babcock and his staff duped them into signing up for credit without their knowledge or consent. Others said Babcock refused to refund their money despite a 30-day opt-out guarantee and a promise for 100% satisfaction. [Lang M. [West Jordan chiropractor gets 6 months in jail for conning elderly patients](http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/57241291-78/babcock-patients-according-chiropractor.html.csp). The Salt Lake Tribune, Dec 9, 2013] In 2008, the Utah Department of Occupational and Professional Licensing (DOPL) issued a \" [non-disciplinary cease-and-desist order](http://www.casewatch.net/board/chiro/babcock/2008_stipulation.pdf)\" after finding that Babcock was advertising treatment for depression, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, learning problems, attention deficit disorder, allergies, hormone replacement relief, sleep problems and memory loss, despite not being licensed to treat these conditions. In April 2012, [the DOPL suspended Babcock's chiropractic license by emergency order](http://www.casewatch.net/board/chiro/babcock/suspension.shtml). The Salt Lake Tribune has noted, however, that he continued to lead seminars in which he touted his nutritional program to reverse Type II diabetes. Although students at chiropractic colleges have little or no opportunity to manage diabetic patients, hundreds of chiropractors throughout the United States are offering the same or similar programs.

Naturopathy, sometimes referred to as \"natural medicine,\" is a largely pseudoscientific approach said to \"assist nature\" [1], \"support the body's inherent assert that diseases are the body's effort to purify itself, and that cures result from increasing the patient's \"vital force.\" They claim to stimulate the body's natural healing processes by ridding it of waste products and \"toxins.\" At first glance, this approach may appear sensible. However, a close look will show that naturopathy's philosophy is simplistic and that its practices are riddled with quackery [4]. The notion of a \"vital force\" or \"life force\"\u2014a nonmaterial force that transcends the laws of chemistry and physics\u2014originated in ancient times. Historians call it the doctrine of vitalism. No scientific evidence supports this doctrine, but a huge body of knowledge, including the entire discipline of organic chemistry, refutes it. Vitalistic practitioners maintain that diseases should be treated by \"stimulating the body's ability to heal itself\" rather than by \"treating symptoms.\" Homeopaths, for example, claim that illness is due to a disturbance of the body's \"vital force,\" which they can correct with special remedies, while many acupuncturists claim that disease is due to imbalance in the flow of \"life energy\" (chi or Qi), which they can balance by twirling needles in the skin. Many chiropractors claim to assist the body's \"Innate Intelligence\" by Medicatrix Naturae.\" Ayurvedic And so on. The \"energies\" postulated by vitalists cannot be measured by scientific methods. According to a comprehensive report presented to the United States Congress in 1970 by the now-defunct National Association of Naturopathic Physicians (NANP): Naturopathy . . . is the technique of treatment of human disease which emphasizes assisting nature. It can embrace minor surgery and the use of nature's agencies, forces, processes, and products, introducing them to the human body by any means that will produce health-yielding results. Naturopathy is based upon the tendency of the body to maintain a balance and to heal itself. The purpose of naturopathic medicine is to further this process by using natural remedies . . . as distinct from \"orthodox\" medicine (allopathy and osteopathy), which seeks to combat disease by using remedies which are chosen to destroy the causative agent or which produce effects different from those produced by the disease treated. . . . Naturopathy places priority upon these conditions as the bases for ill health: (1) lowered vitality; (2) abnormal composition of blood and lymph; (3) maladjustment of muscles, ligaments, bones, and neurotropic disturbances; (4) accumulation of waste matter and poison in the system; (5) germs, bacteria, and parasites which invade the body and flourish because of toxic states which may provide optimum conditions for their flourishing; and (6) consideration of hereditary influences, and (7) psychological disturbances. In applying naturopathic principles to healing, the practitioner may administer one or more specified physiological, mechanical, nutritional, manual, phytotherapeutic, or animal devices or substances. The practitioner's end aim is to remove obstacles to the body's normal functioning, applying natural forces to restore its recuperative facilities. Only those preparations and doses which act in harmony with the body economy are utilized, to alter perverse functions, cleanse the body of its catabolic wastes, and promote its anabolic processes [1]. The [American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP)](http://www.naturopathic.org/) has stated that \"naturopathic medicine has its own unique body of knowledge, evolved and refined for centuries\" and is \"effective in treating all health problems, whether acute or chronic.\" [5] According to a 1989 AANP brochure: The main difference [between naturopathic and conventional medicine] is in philosophic approach. Naturopathic physicians treat patients by restoring overall health rather than suppressing a few key symptoms. Naturopathic physicians are more concerned with finding the underlying cause of a condition and applying treatments that work in alliance with the natural healing mechanisms of the body rather than against them. Naturopathic treatments result less frequently in adverse side effects, or in the chronic conditions that inevitably arise when the cause of disease is left untreated.\" [6] Naturopaths offer treatment at their offices. A few operate spas where patients may reside for several weeks. Their offerings include fasting, \"natural food\" diets, vitamins, [herbs](../../herbs.html), tissue medicine](../../acu.html), natural childbirth, minor surgery, and applications of water, heat, cold, air, sunlight, and electricity. Radiation may be used for diagnosis, but not for treatment. Many of these methods are said to \"detoxify\" the body. Some states permit naturopaths to prescribe various drugs that are listed in a formulary maintained or authorized by their licensing board. What's Wrong with the Above Picture? Scientific research has identified measurable, causative factors and specific methods of preventing and/or treating hundreds of health problems. Naturopaths have done little more than create glib generalities. The above theories are simplistic and/or clash with science-based knowledge of body physiology and pathology. For example: - \"Balance,\" \"vitality,\" and \"harmony with concepts. Like \"optimal health\" or \"supporting\" of the body, these concepts are vague and cannot be objectively measured or scientifically tested. - Naturopaths pretend that precise medical treatment is less important than \"maintaining body balance.\" - Whether infectious disease occurs depends on the degree of exposure to an infectious organism, the virulence of the organism, and the body's ability to resist. A person does not need to be \"toxic\" or \"imbalanced\" in order to catch a cold. - Some diseases are an inevitable result of genetic make-up. Others have little to do with hereditary factors. - The general concept of treating disease by \"strengthening the immune system\" is unsubstantiated and clashes with the fact that in some conditions, such as allergies or autoimmune diseases, the immune system is overreactive. - Naturopathy's claim that \"natural methods\" can treat cancer by strengthening the immune system is unsubstantiated, and the notion that cancer represents a failure of the immune system is simplistic [7]. In the late 1950s, it was hypothesized that the immune system guards against cancer cells in ways similar to its protection against infectious organisms. However, subsequent research has demonstrated that relationships between cancers and the immune system are highly complex and that successful tumors develop \"tolerance\" mechanisms that enable them to invade the body without activating immune responses that would destroy them. The rapidly developing science of cancer immunotherapy is aimed at detecting and defeating these mechanisms. One way might be to mobilize T- cells to attack and destroy cancers, but this will not be simple to do [8]. Merely increasing the number of such cells won't work. Thus the odds that any dietary measure, herb, or other \"alternative\" approach will solve the problem of cancer by increasing immune surveillance should be regarded as zero. Naturopaths assert that their \"natural\" methods, when properly used, rarely have adverse effects because they do not interfere with the individual's inherent healing abilities. This claim is nonsense. Any medication (drug or herb) potent enough to produce a therapeutic effect is potent enough to cause adverse effects. Drugs should not be used (and would not merit FDA approval) unless the probable benefit is significantly greater than the probable risk. Moreover, medically used drugs rarely \"interfere with the healing processes.\" The claim that scientific medical care \"merely eliminates or suppresses symptoms\" is both absurd and pernicious. Most of the things naturopaths do have not been scientifically substantiated; and some\u2014such as [homeopathy](../../homeo.html)\u2014clearly are worthless. In many cases, naturopaths combine sensible dietary advice (based on medically proven strategies) with senseless recommendations for products. A Brief History Modern-day naturopathy can be traced to the concepts of Sebastian Kneipp (1821-1897), Benedict Lust (1872-1945), Kneipp, a German priest, opened a \"water cure\" center after becoming convinced that he and a fellow student had cured themselves of tuberculosis by bathing in the Danube River. Kneipp also developed herbal methods using whole plants. Lust, also German, was treated by Kneipp and in 1892 was commissioned to establish Kneipp's practices in the United States. In 1895, he opened the Kneipp Water-Cure Institute in New York City and began forming Kneipp Societies whose members had been using Kneipp's methods or other \"drugless therapies.\" Subsequently, he acquired degrees in osteopathy, chiropractic, homeopathic medicine, and eclectic medicine [9]. In 1901, Lust organized a national convention and chaired a committee that endorsed the use of massage, herbs, homeopathy, spinal manipulation, and various types of occult healing. In 1902, he purchased the rights to the term \"naturopathy\" from John H. Scheel, another Kneipp disciple, who had coined it in 1895. That same year, he began referring to himself as a naturopath, opened the American Institute of Naturopathy, and replaced the Kneipp Societies with a national naturopathic organization. Lindlahr further systematized naturopathy and opened a sanitarium and a school in a Chicago suburb. Macfadden popularized exercise and fasting. Tilden contributed notions about \"auto-intoxication\" (said to be caused by fecal matter remaining too long in the intestines) and \" [toxemia](http://soilandhealth.org/02healthlibrary/0201hygienlib%7Fcat/020109tilden/020109tilden1stpart.html)\" (alleged to be \"the basic cause of all diseases\"). [10] Naturopathy's grandiose claims attracted the sharp pen of Morris Fishbein, M.D., who edited the Journal of the American Medical Association and spearheaded the AMA's antiquackery campaign for several decades. He noted: Whereas most cults embrace a single conception as to the cause and healing of disease, naturopathy embraces everything in nature. . . . The real naturopaths were, of course, such healers as Father Kneipp . . . and others who advocated natural living and healed by use of sunlight, baths, fresh air, and cold water, but there is little money to be made by these methods. Hence the modern naturopath embraces every form of healing that offers opportunity for exploitation [11]. The practices Fishbein debunked included: - Aeropathy: baking the patient in a hot oven - Alereos system: spinal manipulation plus heat and mechanical vibration - Astral healing: diagnosis and advice based on reading the patient's horoscope - Autohemic therapy: giving a solution made by modifying and \"potentizing\" a few drops of the patient's blood - Autotherapy: treating infections with potions made from the patient's infected tissues or excretions - Biodynamochromic diagnosis and therapy: administering colored lights while thumping on the patient's abdomen - Bloodwashing with herbs - Chromopathy: healing with colored lights - Electrotherapy with various devices - Geotherapy: treating disease with little pads of earth - Irido-diagnosis: diagnosis based on eye markings\u2014now called [iridology](../../iridology.html) - Pathiatry: self-administration of spinal adjustment, massage, and traction - Porotherapy: treatment applied through the pores of the skin to the nerves said to the control internal organs - Practo-therapy, a fancy term for intestinal irrigation - Sanatology, based on the notion that acidosis and toxicosis are the two basic causes of all disease - Somapathy: spinal adjustment followed by applications of cold or extreme heat - Tropo-therapy with special nutritional foods - Vit-O-Pathy, a combination of 36 other systems - Zodiac therapy, combining astrology and herbs - Zonotherapy (now called reflexology): pressing on various parts of the body to heal disease in designated body \"zones.\" [11] Most of these methods disappeared along with their creators, but some (or their offshoots) are still used today. The total number of naturopathic practitioners in the United States is unknown but includes chiropractors and acupuncturists who practice naturopathy. The AANP was founded in 1985 and is closely allied with the 4-year naturopathic colleges. Its membership is said to be limited to individuals who are eligible for licensing in states that issue licenses. Its online directory contains about 1300 names. The [American Naturopathic Medical Association (ANMA)](http://www.anma.com/), founded in 1981, claims to represent about 2,000 members worldwide. Although some have recognized credentials in other health disciplines, others merely have an \"ND\" degree obtained through a nonaccredited correspondence school. The [Homeopathic Academy of Naturopathic Physicians (HANP](http://www.hanp.net)), which requires a recognized professional degree and additional homeopathic training, lists about 50 members in the United States and Canada. The AANP published the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine six times between 1990 and 1996. The issues ran from about 80 to 100 pages. The third issue was devoted to \"Non-Standard HIV/ARC/AIDS Management.\" The fifth, which attacked immunization, contained papers suggesting that vaccines may be a factor in causing cancer and that homeopathic prophylaxis using nosodes would be effective and safer than standard vaccines. (Nosodes are homeopathic products made from pathological organs or tissues: causative agents such as bacteria, fungi, ova, parasites, virus particles and yeast; disease products; or excretions. There is no scientific evidence that nosodes are effective, and the FDA has ordered several manufactures to stop making preventive claims for them. The sixth issue of the journal promoted the use of \"natural\" products for cancer and contained an absurd article claiming that measuring the electrical resistance of the skin may be a useful way to diagnose the early stages of cancer and AIDS. In December 2009, the AANP, partnered with publisher Karolyn A. Gazella, began producing the online [Journal of Naturopathic Medicine](http://www.naturalmedicinejournal.com/), which is published monthly. Education A 1927 AMA study listed 12 naturopathic schools with fewer than 200 students among them [12]. During the 1920s and 1930s, about half the states passed laws under which naturopaths and/or \"drugless healers\" could practice. However, as modern medicine developed, many of these laws were repealed and all but a few mail-order schools ceased operations. The doctor of naturopathy (N.D.) degree was still available at several chiropractic colleges, but by 1957, the last of these colleges stopped issuing it. The [National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NCNM) ](http://www.ncnm.edu/)was founded in 1956 in Portland, Oregon, but, until the mid-1970s, had very few students. From 1960 through 1968, the average enrollment was eight and the total number of graduates was 16 [1]. Today, within the United States, a \"doctor of naturopathy\" (N.D.) or \"doctor of naturopathic medicine\" (N.M.D.) credential is available from five full-time schools of naturopathy and several nonaccredited correspondence schools. Training at the full-time schools follows a pattern similar to that of chiropractic schools: two years of basic science courses and two years that include working in outpatient clinics. Because medical school programs also last four years that include two years of basic science training, many naturopaths claim that their education is equivalent. There are several big differences, however. - The quality of medical school programs is vastly superior to those of naturopathic schools. Medical school faculties are much larger and better trained, and the scope and depth of clinical experience are much greater because people going to medical school clinics encompass the full gamut of disease. - Much of naturopathy's coursework embraces practices\u2014such as homeopathy\u2014that have zero validity. - Some naturopathic graduates take an additional year of postgraduate training where they work in an outpatient setting. However, most go directly into practice. Nearly all medical school graduates undergo 3-6 years of additional full-time specialty training that includes work with hospital inpatients. The leading accredited school, [Bastyr University](http://www.bastyr.edu/), in Seattle, Washington, was founded in 1978. Besides its N.D. program, Bastyr offers a B.S. degree program in Natural Health Sciences with majors in nutrition and Oriental medicine; a B.S. program in psychology; B.S. and M.A. programs in applied behavioral sciences; M.S. programs in nutrition and acupuncture/oriental medicine; and a certificate in midwifery. Bastyr has also provided health-food retailers and their employees with home-study programs that promote \"natural\" approaches for the gamut of disease. Students in the naturopathic degree program are required to take three courses in homeopathy and can elect to take three more. The [Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine and Health Sciences](http://www.scnm.edu/) in Scottsdale, Arizona, was founded in 1992. The [University of Bridgeport College of Natural Medicine](http://www.bridgeport.edu/naturopathy/index.html) in Bridgeport, Connecticut, began classes in 1997. The [ National University of Health Sciences](http://www.nuhs.edu/academics/college-of-professional-studies/naturopathic-medicine/), located near Chicago, which has offered chiropractic degrees since 1966, got its doctor of naturopathy program approved in 2006. Naturopathy schools receive much of their financial support from companies that market dietary supplements, homeopathic products, and/or herbal remedies. The naturopathic programs offered by correspondence schools span much less time and include no experience with actual patients. Accreditation In 1987, the U.S. Secretary of Education approved the [Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME)](http://www.cnme.org/) as an accrediting agency for the full-time schools. As with acupuncture and chiropractic schools, this recognition was not based upon the scientific validity of what is taught but on such factors as record-keeping, physical assets, financial status, makeup of the governing body, catalog characteristics, nondiscrimination policy, and self-evaluation system. NCNM, Bastyr, and Southwest became accredited. In 1999, the U.S. Department of Education staff and the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) asked U.S. Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley to deny CNME's application for renewal of recognition. The recommendation was based on evidence that CNME did not respond appropriately to violations of its standards at Southwest College. The staff report [13] and testimony at a NACIQI meeting [14] indicated that in 1997 and 1998, the school underwent an administrative upheaval that had nearly led to its closure. Several officials resigned or were abruptly fired, classes were suspended for two weeks, and the school's bank accounts were temporarily frozen after the school's chief financial officer was fired. CNME testified at the hearing that it had closely followed the situation and urged school officials to correct the problems. However, the Department of Education staff and a majority of NACIQI members concluded that CNME had failed to issue a timely order to show cause why Southwest should not have its candidacy for accreditation ended [14]. In January 2001, [Riley agreed that CNME's approval should not be renewed](http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/accreditation.html) [15]. However, CNME reapplied, was approved in 2003, and has remained approved since that time. Legal Status Naturopaths are licensed as independent practitioners in 16 states (Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Washington), the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands [16]. They can also legally practice in a few others. Efforts are on the way to to press for licensure in the remaining states. Graduates of the 4-year schools assert that licensing is needed to protect the public from unqualified practitioners. However, the existing naturopathic licensing boards have done little or nothing to protect the public from naturopathy's widespread quackery. Since the proposed laws would set educational requirements that many of ANMA's members could not meet, ANMA has vigorously opposed the licensing efforts. The National Council Against Health Fraud has pointed out: The difference between more and less educated naturopaths is . . . . like comparing more and less educated witch doctors. It could actually be argued that less-schooled naturopaths are safer because they may have a smaller bag of tricks and, because they don't consider themselves \"primary health physicians\" are more apt to refer patients to M.D.'s for additional care [17]. Naturopathic services are not covered by Medicare or most insurance policies. Expansion of naturopathic licensing will make naturopaths appear more legitimate and could help them gain passage of \"insurance equality\" laws that force insurance companies to cover their services. Scope of Practice Most naturopaths allege that virtually all diseases are within their scope. The most comprehensive naturopathic publications that illustrate this belief are the Textbook of Natural Medicine [18-21] and the Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine [22-24]. The textbook, now in its fourth edition, was written for students and professionals; the encyclopedia, now in its third edition, was written for the general public. Joseph E. Pizzorno, Jr., N.D., president (later president emeritus) of Bastyr University, and Michael T. Murray, N.D., a faculty member, edited the textbook and co-authored the encyclopedia. Both books recommend questionable dietary measures, vitamins, minerals, and/or herbs for more than 70 health problems ranging from acne to AIDS. For many of these conditions, daily administration of ten or more products is recommended\u2014some in dosages high enough to cause toxicity. Some treatments are recommended even though the authors indicate that the evidence supporting them is preliminary, speculative, or even conflicting. The textbook discuss many dubious diagnostic tests as though they have validity. Arnold Relman, M.D., Editor-in-Chief Emeritus of The New England Journal of Medicine, has written a [devastating review of the textbook's second (1999) edition](relman1.html) in which he concludes: Many of the treatments recommended in the Textbook . . . are not likely to be effective, and treatments proven to be effective are often totally ignored. This could endanger the health and safety of patients with serious diseases who relied solely on care from a naturopathic practitioner [25]. The third edition of the Encyclopedia recommends inappropriate testing that could lead to the diagnosis of nonexistent problems and inappropriate treatment of many if not most patients who consult naturopaths. For example: - The chapter on hypothyroidism claims (incorrectly) that taking one's armpit temperature upon awakening is a reliable test for thyroid function and that naturopaths prefer treating hypothyroidism with desiccated thyroid. The book also states that \"health-food-store thyroid preparations . . . . may provide enough support\" to help a mild thyroid problem, even though the FDA requires such products to be hormone-free. Scientific physicians consider desiccated thyroid (made from dried animal glands) inferior because its potency can vary from batch to batch. Synthetic thyroid hormone does the job efficiently. Using a product that might contain no hormone is even more ridiculous. - The chapter on \"detoxification\" improperly links dental amalgams to \"fatigue, headache, insomnia, nerve disorders, high blood pressure, impaired memory and concentration,\" falsely claims that 25% of Americans suffer from heavy metal poisoning, and advocates periodic fasting plus various supplements and herbs. - Page 112 states that the best way to determine the \"body load\" of heavy metals is through challenge testing. This advice is pernicious because most people have trace amounts of lead and mercury circulating harmlessly in their blood stream. In challenge testing (also called provoked testing), a chelating agent is administered that temporarily increases excretion. The resultant test report typically suggests abnormalities for which the practitioner recommends \"detoxification.\" [26] The widespread involvement of naturopaths with nonexistent metal toxicity is illustrated by searching with Google. In November 2013, my search for \"naturopath + metal toxicity\" yielded 31,300 hits and my search for \"Naturopath + amalgam\" yields 2.3 million hits. - The \"Candidiasis\" chapter espouses Dr. William Crook's fad diagnosis of \" [candidiasis hypersensitivity](../../candida.html)\" and includes Crook's three-page questionnaire for determining the probability that \"yeast-connected problems are present.\" The questionnaire does not have the slightest validity. - The chapter on angina gives a glowing recommendation for [chelation therapy](../../chelation.html), which the scientific community regards as worthless. - The chapter on \"cellulite\" falsely claims that a gotu kola extract has \"demonstrated impressive results.\" In The Complete Book of Juicing, Murray recommends juices for treating scores of ailments. He also advises everyone to use supplements because \"even the most dedicated health advocate . . . cannot possibly meet the tremendous nutritional requirements for optimum health through diet alone.\" [27] These ideas lack scientific validity. In another book, Murray claims that juicing is valuable because fresh juice provides the body with \"live\" enzymes [28]. [This idea is absurd](../../juicing.html). The enzymes in plants help regulate the metabolic function of plants. When ingested, they do not act as enzymes within the human body, because they are digested rather than absorbed intact into the body [29]. Pizzorno and Murray have claimed that \"in most instances, the naturopathic alternative offers significant benefits over standard medical practices.\" That statement is preposterous. For the few illnesses where their encyclopedia acknowledges that medical treatment is essential (because otherwise the patient may die), they propose naturopathic treatment in addition. In many passages, they describe prevailing medical practices inaccurately. A Revealing Anecdote Pizzorno's book Total Wellness: Improve Your Health By Understanding Your Body's Healing Systems contains a chapter titled \"Strengthen Your Immune System,\" in which the following anecdote is used to illustrate how naturopaths regard \"immune suppression\" as an underlying cause of disease: Several years ago I began to develop large warts on several of my fingers. Warts are an interesting phenomenon; they tend to grow or recede according to how well the immune system is functioning. Although I treated them several times with thuja oil (a standard naturopathic treatment for warts), they had not responded very well. I was perplexed because I was living a pretty healthful lifestyle and using a therapy I'd used successfully for a lot of patients. Then I visited the dentist. As I've only had one cavity, I hadn't been to the dentist for several years. Surprisingly, X-rays revealed an abscess in that one tooth\u2014the filling had not been sealed properly. A week of antibiotics cleared the infection, and within three months all my warts were gone. Even though I had had no other symptoms, the abscess was continually draining my immune system. [30] Any sensible preventive dental-care program should include visits every 6-12 months for professional cleaning (to remove gumline calculus to prevent gum disease), a check for early signs of tooth decay (cavities), and occasional x-ray examination to look for hidden problems. How come Pizzorno\u2014despite all his talk about prevention\u2014does not believe he should have dental check-ups like the rest of us? What does it mean that he permitted large warts to develop on his fingers without seeking medical treatment? (You can decide this for yourself.) Did fixing the abscess actually lead to the disappearance of the warts? I doubt that this has been scientifically studied. However, it is well known that most common warts disappear spontaneously within two years or can be effectively removed with simple, nonscarring medical treatment [31]. Another Revealing Glimpse The AANP claims that \"naturopathic physicians are not opposed to invasive and suppressive measures when these methods are necessary [and] make referrals for such treatment when appropriate.\" [6] I doubt that the majority of naturopaths fit this description. Many naturopaths espouse nutrition and lifestyle measures that coincide with current medical recommendations. However, this advice is often accompanied by nonstandard advice that is irrational. Although naturopaths claim to emphasize prevention, most oppose or are overly critical of immunization. The AANP presents an overly negative view of immunization [32]. Several years ago, as part of a child-custody evaluation, I examined records from nine naturopaths who had treated a child whose mother was antagonistic to medical care and was briefly enrolled as a naturopathy student. The child was not properly immunized and did not see a medical doctor until she developed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus shortly before her eighth birthday. \"chronic cough,\" \"vaginitis,\" \"urinary burning\" and \"asthma\" were noted in the records, there were no indications that these problems had been adequately diagnosed or appropriately treated. (One episode of \"chest congestion,\" for example, was treated with homeopathic remedies.) Three of the practitioners used a [Vegatest device](../../electro.html) to diagnose \"allergies\" to sugar and many other foods and had recommended severe dietary restrictions, even though the child had not reacted adversely to any of the foods. (The Vegatest is quack device that merely measures the amount of moisture on the skin and how hard the practitioner presses a probe against the patient's fingers or toes.) Another practitioner recommended [chelation therapy](../../chelation.html) after diagnosing \"heavy metal poisoning\" with a [hair analysis](../../hair.html). The recommended treatments for both actual and nonexistent conditions included regimens of up to 35 pills a day, including some supplements in potentially toxic doses. The only medical referral took place after the child developed severe signs of diabetes. Although the nine naturopaths do not constitute a random sample, their unscientific practices were consistent with typical naturopathic writings. Scandal in Arizona In May 2001, the Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Board of Medical Examiners fired its executive director, John L. Brewer, D.C., following allegations that he shredded documents, copied exams, and misrepresented his credentials. According to a report in the Arizona Republic, a board member had discovered that Brewer did not receive a naturopathic degree from a college in Los Angeles as he had claimed on his license application [33]. In June 2000, the Arizona Auditor General had severely criticized the board's performance. The most serious deficiencies involved the naturopathic licensing examination, which had not been validated to ensure that it tests what naturopaths would need to practice safely. Even worse, the board consistently \"adjusted\" scores upward so that everyone taking the exam since 1998 passed it. With the February 1999 exam, for example: - Although none of the 18 applicants scored the necessary 75%, all scores were adjusted upward. - The board gave full credit for about one-sixth that were \"too difficult.\" - Since 9 out of 18 applicants were still too low, additional \"adjustments\" were made. - One applicant got full credit for 90 incorrect answers on part 2 of the 3-part test. The Auditor General's report also noted that complaints to the board had not received adequate attention and that record-keeping and overall management had been inadequate [34]. The Bottom Line In 1968, the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) recommended against Medicare coverage of naturopathy. [HEW's report](hew.html) concluded: Naturopathic theory and practice are not based upon the body of basic knowledge related to health, disease, and health care which has been widely accepted by the scientific community. Moreover, irrespective of its theory, the scope and quality of naturopathic education do not prepare the practitioner to make an adequate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment [35]. Although some aspects of naturopathic education have improved in recent years, I believe this conclusion is still valid. I believe that the average naturopath is a muddlehead who combines commonsense health and nutrition measures and rational use of a few herbs with a huge variety of unscientific practices and anti-medical double-talk.

I am furious and at the same time saddened, if that is possible; how dare you write articles titled \"Ayurvedic Mumbo-Jumbo\" and \"Aromatherapy, Making Dollars out of Scents\"? Why do you need to be so incredibly flippant and dismissing, what are you afraid of? It is you who are unfairly misleading the public. You critique/critisize and dismiss medicicinal practices (ayurvedic, CTM, herbalism),from countries that are thousands of years old, seducing the general public with stats, tests and the scientific method. What you are forgetting to mention to people is that Allopathic (western) medicine is less than 400 years old, a mere infant in the life cycle of medicine and healing. Allopathic medicine is responsible for countless numbers of deaths due to poor diagnosis, deadly drug interactions, using human beings as guinea pigs for new and improved drugs (only to find years later the damage many of these drugs have caused) and the 'instant fix', band-aid approach to healing. I look forward to reading ALL of the articles on this site, I am sure that doing this will further my faith in Alternative Medicine. You see, alternative medicine is not interested in insulting western medicine in order to further its healing practices; to be fair to all, why don't you include articles on the many dangers and deaths of modern medicine? I think it would round out this site nicely. This article was revised on November 26, 2013. [Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-ninety-four) [The Herbal Minefield](https://quackwatch.org/related/herbs/) Americans spend billions of dollars per year for capsules, tablets, bulk herbs, and herbal teas.

Multilevel distributors and pharmacies offer many products that are obviously intended for self-medication. Herbs are also marketed by naturopaths, acupuncturists, iridologists, chiropractors, offbeat nutritionists, and unlicensed herbalists, many of whom prescribe them for the entire gamut of health problems. Most such practitioners are not qualified to make appropriate medical diagnoses or to determine how the products they prescribe compare to proven drugs.

This statement ... Americans spend billions of dollars per year for capsules, tablets, bulk herbs, and herbal teas.

[Herbal advocates like to point out that about half of today's medicines were derived from plants. (Digitalis, for example, was originally derived from leaves of the foxglove plant.) This statement is true but misleading. Drug products contain specified amounts of active ingredients. Herbs in their natural state can vary greatly from batch to batch and often contain chemicals that cause side effects but provide no benefit.] When potent natural substances are discovered, drug companies try to isolate and synthesize the active chemical in order to provide a reliable supply. They also attempt to make derivatives that are more potent, more predictable, and have fewer side effects. In the case of digitalis, derivatives provide a spectrum of speed and duration of action. Digitalis leaf is almost never used today because its effects are less predictable. Many herbs contain hundreds or even thousands of chemicals that have not been completely cataloged. Some of these chemicals may turn out to be useful as therapeutic agents, but others could well prove toxic. Even when a botanical product contains ingredients that are potentially effective, it may not be practical to use. Garlic, for example, has been demonstrated to lower cholesterol. However, prescription drugs are more potent for this purpose, and garlic has anticoagulant properties. No data are available to indicate the risk of combining garlic with other widely used products (vitamin E, ginkgo, fish oil, and aspirin) that can interfere with blood clotting. Little Public Protection In the United States, herbs intended for preventive or therapeutic use would be regulated as drugs under federal laws. To evade the law, these products are marketed as \"foods\" or \"dietary supplements\" without health claims on their labels. Since these are not regulated as drugs, no legal standards exist for their processing, harvesting, or packaging. In many cases, particularly for products with expensive raw ingredients, contents and potency are not accurately disclosed on the label. Many products marked as herbs contain no useful ingredients, and some even lack the principal ingredient for which people buy them. Surveys have found have found that the ingredients and doses of several products varied considerably from brand to brand. - A Good Housekeeping Institute analysis of six widely available St. John's wort supplement capsules and four liquid extracts revealed a lack of consistency of the suspected active ingredients, hypericin and pseudohypericin. The study found: - A 17-fold difference between the capsules containing the smallest amount of hypericin and those containing the largest amount, based on manufacturer's maximum recommended dosage. - A 13-fold difference in pseudohypericin in the capsules. - A 7-to-8-fold differential from the highest to the lowest levels of liquid extracts [1]. - A similar investigation by the Los Angeles Times found that 7 of 10 St. John's wort products contained between 75% and 135% of the labeled hypericin level, and three contained no more than about half the labeled potency [2]. - Researchers at the University of Arkansas who tested 20 supplement products containing ephedra (ma huang) found many differences in alkaloid content from product to product and between two lots of the same product. Half the products exhibited discrepancies of 20% or more between the label claim and the actual content, and one product contained no ephedra alkaloids [3]. Ephedra products are marketed as \"energy boosters\" and/or \"thermogenic\" diet aids, even though no published clinical trials substantiate that they are safe or effective for these purposes. The researchers also noted that hundreds of such products are marketed and that their number exceeds that of conventional prescription and nonprescription ephedra products, which are FDA-approved as decongestants - The April 2000 issue of D Magazine reported that\u2014at its request\u2014a leading laboratory had tested five brands of DHEA, ginger, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, melatonin, saw palmetto, St. John's wort, and milk thistle purchased at five stores in the Dallas area. The ginger and melatonin products contained the stated amounts, but 10 of the other 30 products did not, and a few products had capsules that easily fell apart [4]. - In October 2003, the AMA Archives of Internal Medicine reported the results of a survey of herbal products at twenty retail stores in and around Minneapolis. The chosen herbs were echinacea, St. John's wort, ginkgo biloba, garlic, saw palmetto, ginseng, goldenseal, aloe, Siberian ginseng, and valerian. The authors noted that 43% of 880 products were labeled with the ingredients and dosage that had used in published studies of the ingredients. The actual ingredients were not measured, but the survey indicated that many manufacturers failed to formulate their products to correspond with available research data [5]. - In 2010, ConsumerLab told me that nearly half of the herbal products they had tested for quality had failed their evaluations. The reason for failure included too little or too little of the main ingredient, potentially dangerous or illegal ingredients, contamination with heavy metals, \"spiking\" with unexpected ingredients, and misleading or incomplete product information. - In 2013, Canadian researchers used DNA barcoding (a type of genetic \"fingerprinting\") to test 44 products from 12 companies and found that 59% of the products contained ingredients not listed on the label, 30 of the 44 products had ingredient substitutions, and some contained contaminants that posed health risks to users [6]. Some manufacturers are trying to develop industrywide quality-assurance standards, but possible solutions are a long way off. Regulation Is Minimal The [Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ](../../02ConsumerProtection/dshea.html)included herbal products in its definition of \"dietary supplements,\" even though herbs have little or no nutritional value. (The bill was spearheaded by the health-food industry in order to weaken FDA regulation of its products.) Herbal or other botanical ingredients include processed or unprocessed plant parts (bark, leaves, flowers, fruits, and stems) as well as extracts and essential oils. They are available as teas, powders, tablets, capsules, and elixirs, and may be marketed as single substances or combined with other herbs, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, or non-nutrient ingredients. Products containing multiple herbal ingredients may produce adverse effects that are impossible to predict. A 1999 survey by Prevention magazine found that 12% of herbal remedy users reported adverse reactions [7]. The manufacture of prescription and over-the-counter drugs is closely regulated by the FDA, But herbal products are not [8]. Even the fact that an herb is known to be toxic does not ensure its removal from the marketplace. When the FDA concludes that an herb is dangerous, it usually issues a warning rather than a ban. Several years ago, the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition maintained a database of reports the FDA has received of adverse events associated with the use of dietary supplements and herbal products. However, the database is no longer posted because the FDA could not be certain that the reported problems were caused by the products or had occurred for other reasons. Much Unreliable Information To make a rational decision about an herbal product, it would be necessary to know what it contains, whether it is safe, and whether it has been demonstrated to be as good or better than pharmaceutical products available for the same purpose. For most herbal ingredients this information is incomplete or unavailable. Even worse, most published information about herbs is unreliable. The late Varro E. Tyler, Ph.D., former dean of the Purdue University School of Pharmacy and a leading authority on pharmacognosy (the science of medicines from natural sources), observed: More misinformation about the safety and efficacy of herbs is reaching the public currently than at any previous time, including the turn-of-the-century heyday of patent medicines. The literature promoting herbs includes pamphlets, magazine articles, and books ranging in quality from cheaply printed flyers to elaborately produced studies in fine bindings with attractive illustrations. Practically all of these writings recommend large numbers of herbs for treatment based on hearsay, folklore, and tradition. The only criterion that seems to be avoided in these publications is scientific evidence. Some writings are so comprehensive and indiscriminate that they seem to recommend everything for anything. Even deadly poisonous herbs are sometimes touted as remedies, based on some outdated report or a misunderstanding of the facts. Particularly insidious is the myth that there is something almost magical about herbal drugs that prevents them, in their natural state, from harming people [9]. Two of Tyler's books (The Honest Herbal and Herbs of Choice) summarize what is known about many commonly used herbs, as do several published guidebooks for professionals. However, for most substances, not enough is known to make well-informed decisions about their use. The American Botanical Council, which markets many science-based herbal guidebooks, includes several unreliable books in its otherwise valuable catalog. In 1996, [I asked the council's executive director Mark Blumenthal to purge the catalog of books that contain highly irresponsible or quack advice](../../04ConsumerEducation/NegativeBR/ody.html#blumenthal). When he refused, I made a similar request to Tyler, who was a member of the Council's 7-person board of trustees. But the books I complained about remained in the catalog, and several other quacky ones were added. A study published in 2002 found that many sites located by searching for \"herbs\" and \"cancer cure\" contained illegal claims [10]. I advise consumers to ignore advice from anyone who has a financial interest in the sale of dietary supplements, herbs, or homeopathic products. Researchers from Harvard have evaluated claims made on 443 Web sites located by searching for information about eight widely used herbal supplements (ginkgo biloba, St. John's wort, root) The researchers concluded: - Among 443 sites, 338 (76%) were retail sites either selling product or directly linked to a vendor. - 273 (81%) of the 338 retail Web sites made 1 or more health claims, with 149 (44%) claiming to treat, prevent, diagnose, or cure specific diseases. - More than half (153/292; 52%) of sites with a health claim omitted the legally required standard federal disclaimer. - Nonretail sites were more likely than retail sites to include literature references, but only 52 (12%) of the 443 Web sites provided referenced information without a link to a distributor or vendor. - Consumers may be misled by vendors' claims that herbal products can treat, prevent, diagnose, or cure specific diseases, despite regulations prohibiting such statements. Physicians should be aware of this widespread and easily accessible information. - More effective regulation is required to put this class of therapeutics on the same evidence-based footing as other medicinal products. The involvement of drug companies into the herbal marketplace may improve standardization of dosage for a few products. And public and professional interest in herbs is likely to stimulate more research. However, with safe and effective medicines available, treatment with herbs rarely makes sense, and many of the conditions for which herbs are recommended are not suitable for self-treatment. Reliable Information Sources - The [Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database](http://www.quackwatch.org/n)is available online and in print [12] for $92 per year (or $151 for both versions). The online version is updated daily, while the print version is updated several times a year. A review noted that the 1999 book covered 964 herbs and dietary supplements, of which only 15% had been proven safe and only 11% had been proven effective for the indications for which they are used [13]. In 2005, Harrriet Hall, M.D., noted that only about 5% of the substances listed in the 2007 book were rated effective and most of these were either vitamins, minerals, or substances that were also ingredients in standard drugs [14]. The current edition covers about 1,100.

Science-Based Medicine Blog, Feb 2, 2011. | | Reader Response (2/14/00) You, sir, are the quack. How could you even think of saying, \"With safe and effective medicines available, treatment with herbs rarely makes sense.\"? The correct statement would be: \"With all those dangerous drugs available, with all those terrible side effects, treatment with herbs is the only choice.\" All pharmaceuticals are toxic to the human body. Over 150,000 hospital patients die every year from taking the prescribed dosage of a drug prescribed to them by their doctor. Drugs have their place\u2014in emergencies only\u2014or when a condition has become so bad that the patient is willing to deal with the side effects in order to treat the main problem. Modern \"medicine\" is more of a scam than herbal medicine could ever be. If people with health problems would stay away from drug stores and spend more time in health food stores, people would live longer, stay healthier, and have a better quality of life. Talk to the men who take blood pressure \"medicine\" and can no longer get an erection. Talk to the relatives of the men who died from taking viagra. Drugs only address the symptoms, herbs address the cause. Drugs simply mask the symptoms, herbs assist in the healing. I have a B.S. in education from Indiana State University, have been studying natural medicine for 17 years, and have been working as a health food store manager and nutritional consultant for 7 years. My disdain for pharmaceutical industry is the result of hearing the horror stories of my customers about the side effects of the drugs they have used. Many of the herb shop customers of today are people who have had bad experiences with prescription drugs and/or doctors who won't listen to or work with them. In a way i am thankful for the drug industry, because they drive many people into health food stores. I don't mean to imply that there is no place for drugs, because there definitely is a place for them. However drugs should be the last resort. This article was revised on November 23, 2013.

Chiropractors convicted of insurance fraud. Two Georgia chiropractors who improperly billed for spinal decompression therapy have been successfully prosecuted. In 2007, Steven Levine, D.C. and William Stearns, D.C., were accused of using false codes to bill for more than $1.8 million for spinal decompression therapy with a VAX-D machine and about $817,000 for use of a Hako-Med device. (Hako-Med devices are claimed to provide pain relief by administering electrical impulses to the skin.) The [indictment](http://www.casewatch.net/doj/stearns_levine/indictment.pdf) stated that after the pair began using VAX-D, they typically applied Hako-Med after each VAX-D treatment. In August, Levine pled guilty to one count of health care fraud related to the VAX-D. This month, a federal jury found Stearns guilty on eighteen charges of health care fraud and five of money laundering. Spinal decompression is widely advertised as a means to relieve back pain. It may provide relief for properly selected patients, but it has not been proven more effective than simple traction. Medicare and many insurance companies don't cover it. Some cover it as a form of mechanical traction, for which they pay far less than the amounts charged by spinal decompression providers. Providers who try to get around this by using billing codes for other procedures (such as surgical decompression) can be prosecuted. [Barrett S.

Caplinger died in 2009 while serving a 12-year prison sentence for fraud and money laundering in connection with a cancer scam [1]. Among other things, he claimed to have a medical degree from the British West Indies Medical College (BWIMC) in the Dominican Republic. It turned out, however, that he founded and directed the \"school\" and issued the diploma to himself. In the early 1990s, Caplinger began offering to provide chiropractors with a pathway to a medical degree that was expensive but required minimal effort. Some students may have attended BWIMC for a few weeks of lectures, but it is clear that the school had no qualified faculty and did provided no real medical education. According to a report in Dynamic Chiropractic: Caplinger ... Gregory E. Caplinger died in 2009 while serving a 12-year prison sentence for fraud and money laundering in connection with a cancer scam [1]. Among other things, he claimed to have a medical degree from the British West Indies Medical College (BWIMC) in the Dominican Republic. It turned out, however, that he founded and directed the \"school\" and issued the diploma to himself. In the early 1990s, Caplinger began offering to provide chiropractors with a pathway to a medical degree that was expensive but required minimal effort. Some students may have attended BWIMC for a few weeks of lectures, but it is clear that the school had no qualified faculty and did provided no real medical education. According to a report in Dynamic Chiropractic: - Caplinger pretended to operate two entities: the \"British West Indies Medical College\" and the \"Universidad Federico Henriquez Y Carvajal,\" to which students would supposedly transfer after nine weeks of preparatory coursework. - At various times, Caplinger claimed to be president; dean; chairman of the Dept. of Internal Medicine; chairman of the Dept. of Immunology; and Administrator, Chief Dept. of Oncology/Immunology. - In 1996, he was arrested in Broward County, Florida, on ten counts of racketeering (RICO) and grand theft. - More than 120 individuals had paid him several thousands dollars each. - In 1997, the charges were dismissed after Caplinger agreed to make partial restitution [2]. You might think that the above circumstances would discourage other people from claiming to be BWIMC graduates. However, I have found four: [Joel Robbins](http://www.whole-isticsolutions.com/joelrobbins.htm)is a licensed chiropractor who operates the Health & Wellness Clinic of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Robbins, also has a bogus naturopathic \"degree\" from a diploma mill called the Anglo-American Institute of Drugless Therapy [3]. - James Edward Kellogg directs the physical therapy department at the Laser Spine Institute (LSI) in Tampa, Florida. He has valid degrees in physical therapy and chiropractic and is licensed to practice both. However, during the summer of 2006, the Laser Spine Institute Web site briefly represented him as \"James Kellogg, M.D.\" based on his alleged BWIMC medical degree [4]. A clinic representative notified me that listing him as an M.D. was inadvertant error caused by miscommunication between LSI and the individual who wrote copy for their Web site and was not intended to mislead anyone that he was a medical doctor licensed iin Florida. [John W. Apsley, II](http://www.drapsley.com/Pages/aboutus.aspx)describes himself on his Web site as \"a physician and researchers who has specialized in the rehabilitation and reversal of chronic diseases hrough accelerated tissue epair and cellular regeneration.\" The CV on his site states that he received a BS in Nutrition from Donsbach Uiversity [a nonaccredited correspondence school] in 1981, a chiropractic degree from Life Chiropractic College in 1984, and a \"Doctor of Eclectic Medicine - MB(E)\" from BWIMC in 1986 and has been licensed as a chiropractor in North Carolina and an Acupuncturist in Alabama. He is not currently listed in the license databases of either state. - Laurence Perry is an unlicensed naturopath who operated a clinic in West Virginia for many years. In 2002, he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and practicing medicine without a license following the death of an eight-year-old diabetic child whose mother followed Parry's advice to stop administering insulin [5]. The documents gathered by Perry's prosecutor included one from BWIMC which stated that \"On the 20th day of March 1987, his degree of \"Doctor of Medicine in Homeopathic and Eclectic Medicine (M.D.E.) was granted with honors.\" Perry's \"transcript\" stated that he matriculated on 3/20/86 and graduated one year later after completing 5 \"terms\" of classes totaling 540 hours of course work, 6 clinical rotations totaling 2000 hours, 3 dissertations (760 hours), 2 research papers, and an oral examination. None of this was possible, of course because he lived and worked in South Carolina during that year. The address for the school was given as \"c/o American Nutritional Medical Association, 1326 Dearborn Street, Gary Indiana.\" The AMNA, founded in 1983, was an elaborate \"paper conglomerate\" that issued scores of different phony credentials [6]. Caplinger claimed to be a senior AMNA vice president in charge of legal affairs and credential services. The Indiana address suggests that BWIMC was hatched in 1987 or earlier as part of AMNA's credential scheme.

He subsequently reported finding CCSVI in 100% of MS patients and developed an angioplastic procedure\u2014sometimes called \"liberation therapy\"\u2014in which veins in the neck or chest are widened by inflating a balloon within them or (rarely) inserting a stent. However, the people who judged whether CCSVI was present knew which patients had MS and which did not.

FDA warns homeopathic manufacturers. During the past seven months, the FDA has sent warning letters to at least seven homeopathic marketers. The letters mention: - The FDA's [Compliance Policy Guide for homeopathic products](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/homeopetition/cpg.html)states that only products intended solely for self-limiting disease conditions amenable to self-diagnosis (of symptoms) and treatment may be marketed over the counter (OTC). - Products named after a disease (such as \"Infant Earache Drops\" or \"Vaginitis\") that requires medical management or marketed with explicit claims (such as \"useful for inflammations\") that indicate a need for medical management cannot be marketed as OTC drugs. - The companies include [Dolgencorp Inc](http://www.casewatch.net/fdawarning/prod/2013/dolgencorp.shtml).

The Oregon Medical Board has issued a [Statement of Philosophy](http://www.oregon.gov/omb/board/philosophy/Pages/Chelation-Therapy.aspx) regarding chelation therapy. The document states: - There is no scientific evidence that chelation therapy is effective for any medical condition other than heavy metal toxicity. - Post-chelator challenge (\"provoked\") urinary metal testing does not meet the standard of care for diagnosis of heavy metal toxicity. - Chelation should be administered only after making a diagnosis of heavy metal toxicity, which includes (a) a blood test or other accepted unprovoked test confirming the presence of heavy metals and (b) a careful determination that chelation therapy is appropriate for the particular patient. Provoked testing is accomplished by collecting the specimen after administering a chelating agent that artificially and temporarily raises blood and urine levels. [Barrett S. [How \"provoked\" urine metal tests are used to mislead patients](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/urine_toxic.html). Quackwatch, updated May 26, 2017] [The American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology ](http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-medical-toxicology-and-the-american-academy-of-clinical-toxicology/)have jointly warned that \"'provoked' or 'challenge' tests of urine are not reliable means to diagnose metal poisoning and have been associated with harm.\" The Board's action may have been generated by a case in which an autistic child had received several courses of chelation therapy for nonexistent \"lead toxicity\" diagnosed with provoked urine testing. The child's doctor escaped discipline, but the board's announcement suggests that, in the future, similar behavior will be considered unprofessional conduct. |Chiropractic expos\u00e9 published.
