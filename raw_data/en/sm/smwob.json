Whether you thrive in the heat or want to melt away, self-care is essential this time of year: SYNC UP YOUR SLEEP SCHEDULE. Chinese Medicine suggests aligning your sleep schedule with seasonal changes will help you have the most energy throughout your day. In the summer, take advantage of the long days by rising early, napping in the afternoon, and staying up later. This practice will help keep balance within your circadian rhythm AND get the benefits of being in the sun before the rays get too hot and strong. EAT WITH THE SEASON. In these hotter months, our diet should be light, cooling, nutrient-dense, brightly colored, and hydrating. Good options include: apricot, bananas, apples, lettuce, cantaloupe, watermelon, strawberries, tomatoes, citrus, peaches, cucumber, zucchini, asparagus, bok choy, water chestnut, corn, snow peas, and mint. These foods are plentiful this time of year, so be sure to incorporate them into your diet on a regular basis to offset the summer heat. HYDRATE! Balancing fire with water is essential to staying healthy in the summer. This means to be sure to drink plenty of water and keep the mineral and electrolyte balance in check. Chronic dehydration can have more to do with electrolyte and mineral depletion rather than how much water you're actually drinking. Try coconut water on hot days or adding a pinch of sea salt or trace mineral drops to your glass of water. TCM also recommends watermelon juice for cooling the body and cleansing the system. NOURISH THE SPIRIT AND CULTIVATE JOY. This is the essence- or the qi- of the season! Summer also corresponds with the Heart and Small Intestine organ systems, so symptoms like poor memory, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, UTIs, heartburn, or depression will indicate imbalance of these organ systems this time of year. If you're struggling with any of these, it's time to schedule an acupuncture treatment! SCHEDULE AN ACUPUNCTURE APPOINTMENT.
