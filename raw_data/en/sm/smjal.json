UPSTATE update 3He headed the team that carried out the first approved gene therapy clinical protocol, is recognized as an ongoinginnovator in the area of human gene transfer, and is aleading ethicist in human genetic engineering. He has been called the \"Father of Gene Therapy. \" The focus of Dr. Anderson 's present research is the devel- opment of advanced gene therapy delivery systems. One major goal is to design virus based vectors (organisms that transmit a disease) that can be injected directly into patients in order to accomplish gene transfer. This delivery system wouldbe directly applicable to a wide range of human diseases includingcancer, cardiovascular disease, AIDS and genetic diseases.The work is a continuation of his earlier research that ledto the first approved human gene therapy trial in 1990. Dr. Anderson 's future goals include the development of gene therapy using hematopoietic stem cells (since stemcells replenish the blood system throughout life, stem cellgene therapy should provide a cure for genetic diseases),and the development of in utero gene therapy for the treat-ment of genetic diseases that produce irreversible damagebefore birth. Dr. Anderson 's laboratory also collaborates with other programs to develop gene therapy clinical proto-cols for a range of human diseases including cancer, geneticdiseases, AIDS, and cardiovascular diseases. C. Barber Mueller, MD, is professor emeritus of surgery at McMaster University in Canada. His is accomplished inboth academic surgery and medical education. Dr. Mueller was one of the founders of an innovative program, the\"Problem-Based Learning \" method for the education of medical students at McMaster University in Canada. Themethod has been adapted by many medical schools and hasrevolutionized medical education around the world. While his accomplishments have been broadly in the fields of medicine, surgery and medical education, his schol- arly work has been largely in the area of the identification andtreatment of breast cancer and renal disease. Dr. Mueller served as professor and chair of the SUNY Upstate 's Department of Surgery from 1956 to 1967, devel- oping it into a full-time academic department. As chair, he also developed a residency training program, improved theeducation of medical students and substantially upgradedthe practice of surgery in this region. During his distinguished career as an academic surgeon, Dr. Mueller has received many awards. He was a MarkleScholar and received the Distinguished Service Awards fromthe Association for Academic Surgery and the AmericanCollege of Surgeons. He is the author of 125 publications with special emphasis on breast cancer, renal disease and other surgicaltopics and has written widely on issues in medical education.SUNY Upstate Commencement continued from page 1SUNY Upstate Medical University briefs Two presidents and a chancellor Gregory L.

Melissa Cosser, RNC, BA, Anne Klaczko,RNC, AAS Karen Allen, RNC, BSN and Sondra Mott,RNC, BA recently passed the examination sponsored bythe National Certification Corporation (NCC) for theobstetric, gynecologic and neonatal nursing specialties. Tobe eligible for the certification, RN 's must have two years subspecialty practice experience comprised of a minimumof 2,000 hours of telephone triage experience. The NCC examination evaluates the nurses ' compe- tency in adult and pediatric telephone triage assessmentskills, critical thinking and communication skills, profes-sional and legal issues, and clinical expertise. In 2000, the NCC identified telephone triage as an emerging and important nursing subspecialty in a widespectrum of clinical practices including adult primary careand pediatrics. The Corporation then began the process ofdeveloping certification for nurses to be able to demon-strate and be recognized for the skills and knowledgeneeded in telephone nursing. Health Connections staff, including medical director, Dr. Peter Mariani, had an active role in the developmentof the certification exam. Nationally recognized forquality as a comprehensive hospital-based medical callcenter, University Hospital 's Health Connections was requested to submittest items to the NCC content team inthe summer of 2000. HealthConnections staff researched andformulated 25 exam items forconsideration by the commission.Expanding on their traditionalbase of obstetric, and neonatalnursing specialties, the NCC hasnow established an ongoing process for credentialing tele-phone triage nurses. Health Connections RN 's handle over 50,000 calls ayear, provide 24/7 commu-nity-based telephonenursing services, andperform contractual tele-phone triage services forover 100 physicians inprivate practice. 8 UPSTATE update 9 briefsSUNY Upstate Medical University Little Gifts for Life auction raises $195,000 Little Gifts for Life, held March 23 at the OnCenter, attracted 263 guests and raised $195,000 for UniversityHospital 's Center for Children 's Cancer and Blood Disorders.
