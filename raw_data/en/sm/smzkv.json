FOREWARD The following study of Samoan indigenous medicine was carried out by the Office of Comprehensive Health Planning, Department of Medical Ser vices, American Samoa Government during Fiscal Year 1974. The study was funded, in part, by a grant from the South Pacific Commission. Sufficient material has been collected to afford a comprehensive overview, with some degree of specificity concerning t he practice of 'bushmedicine' in American Samoa today. This study could not have been accomplished without the cooperation and valuable assistance of: HC the principle s ources of first -hand knowledge of indigenous medicine. Special recognition also goes to Mrs. Arieta Mulitauaopele, Associate Health Planner for her ability to act as the link between the Samoan taulasea (village healers) and the author of this report. Many thanks to the Samoan Medical Officers at the Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ) Tropical Medical Center for their valuable insight and participation, and finally to the CHP Office Staff; Mrs. Salaina Tulafono, and Miss Valisa Samuelu for their dedicated efforts and support in the typing of the report.

Samoan Medicinal Plants vii PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION Samoan Medicinal Plants and Their Usage was written based upon the expertise of a small group of well - respected traditional healers in American Samoa. It was originally published over twenty yea rs ago, in 1974. From that time to the present the original text has been in demand, with requests coming to the author from many parts of the world. Even in Samoa, it has become rare to obtain a photo -reproduced copy. For that reason alone producing a second edition has been a worthwhile effort. Additionally, the past two decades have seen a growing interest in natural plant compounds for treatment of lethal illnesses, including cancer and AIDS. The greatest global diversity of flora is found in the tr opics, and island plants often only exist in their localized area. Yet studies of Pacific Island plant species and their uses have been limited until recently. At the same time tropical biotic communities are disappearing due to needs for land, timber, a nd other resources. It is hoped that texts such as Samoan Medicinal Plants and Their Usage will inspire a concern for preservation and wise use of our planet's genetic heritage. The second edition of this text has been updated for multiple purposes. Most noticeable is the inclusion of illustrations for each of the 74 species in the study. Complimenting the new illustrations is the revision of names for many of the species. The Samoan and common names remain the same, yet scientific classification of man y plants has changed since the first edition. This demonstrates the expansion of knowledge in the Pacific region as our natural world is studied in greater detail. Although little of the original text has been altered, a new Conclusions section has been a dded by the author. These additions should enhance the publication's use in the classroom, as a field guide, and a reference. Many individuals and agencies have contributed to the availability of this second edition. The project was initiated by an inter est from Mr. Abe Malae, Director of the American Samoa Power Authority. The American Samoa Power Authority provided the catalyst that was then continued through primary funding from the Agricultural Development of the American Pacific (ADAP) project. The original author, Mr. Charles \"Mick\" McCuddin, ASG Health Planner; and ethnobotanist, Dr. Art Whistler, of the UH Manoa Botany Department; both played critical roles in maintaining the integrity of the publication. Petra Scotese demonstrated great persever ance as specimens were located and identified for her quality illustrations. Finally, Michael Harrington prepared the publication with great attention to detail assuring that any changes in the second edition were acceptable to all others involved. It is our hope that this second edition will be useful for another two decades and beyond. Pemerika L. Tauili'ili, Dean and Director ASCC Land Grant Programs Samoan Medicinal Plants 1BACKGROUND AND HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE Little is known about indigenous Samoan medicine before contac t with Europeans. At the time of first contact, the art of healing was practiced by the Samoan priests who attributed the symptoms of illness to possession by an aitu (spirit of departed person) or its influence, and treatment was directed toward driving out the aitu or counteracting its effect. This concept of illness was common throughout Polynesia, and is still widely adhered to in Samoa today. The parts of various indigenous plants played an essential role in the treatment process, as did massage, and the recipes were closely guarded. Even to this day, it is often difficult to learn the true nature of the mixtures being used and the entire process accompanying their administration. It is believed that many of the medicinal preparations were learned o riginally from the Tongans, who in turn learned them from the Fijians, who were thought to be the most advanced in this art. Kramer, the eminent German author who visited Samoa in 1893, recorded some of the plants used for medicinal purposes at that time. Many of these are still being used. The Samoan people have persevered in their desire to retain traditional values and customs. This is strikingly apparent in Samoa today in terms of reaction to illness, and its treatment. It is not surprising, since fo lk remedies and superstition still persist in the highly developed nations in the face of the dramatic scientific technological advances. Traditional patterns are succumbing to the relentless pressures of progress, but when illness threatens village healer s are often sought out for their local remedies. This is especially so when earlier contact with scientific medicine has not produced the expected degree of success. A similar phenomenon is seen in the United States, as well as other \"developed\" countrie s, where persons with incurable disease turn to faith healers, or other forms of \"non -scientific\" treatment, as a last resort. In Samoa, where there is not yet a strong universal confidence in scientific medicine, the threshold for turning to alternative m ethods is much lower. For example, a patient may receive a prescribed medicine at the government hospital and take it home to try for one day, and if dramatic early results are not experienced, discard the medicine and seek treatment from one of the local taulasea or fofo (traditional healer). People who have become dissatisfied with the \"government medicine\" for one reason or another, are often prompted to seek help from these \"bush -doctors\" by another member of the family, usually an older person; possib ly an aunt, or grandmother, who knows someone who \"specializes\" in that particular condition. When ill many people also seek help from these bush doctors for themselves, or their children, as their first source of help. Many feel that there are certain di seases that are unique to the Samoan people, and that these cannot be treated by palagi medicine (Western medicine). Such illnesses often involve the influence of aitu. Individuals with these illnesses frequently go to the bush -doctors for treatment. For any of a variety of reasons, many Samoans continue to seek out the village bush -doctors in preference to, or as an alternative to, Western scientific medicine, as rendered by the government owned and operated LBJ Tropical Medical Center in Faga'alu. There is no use denying this fact, and there is little to be gained (and possibly much to be lost) by ignoring it. Past attempts to stamp out indigenous medicine have failed, and further attempts, if carried to extremes, may serve only to drive the practice underground. Thus, there are in effect, two medical care disciplines being utilized by the Samoan people: government medicine and indigenous village medicine. An understanding of the interaction of these two disciplines and the factors involved in the consu mers choice of which \"system\" to patronize, should be considered by the Comprehensive Health Planning Advisory Council in its recommendations for the improvement of the health status of the Samoan people. Recognizing this the Office of Comprehensive Health Planning, in February of 1973, asked for a complete study of Samoan indigenous medicine. The ultimate goal was to gather and evaluate sufficient information to make some rational decisions regarding the potential usefulness of indigenous medicine and its inherent dangers, toward the end of improving the health status of the people of American Samoa. A secondary objective of the study was to record the present state -of-the-art of Samoan indigenous Samoan Medicinal Plants 2medicine in order to preserve some knowledge of this aspec t of the Samoan culture that might otherwise be lost. On May 1973, the Department of Medical Services received a grant from the South Pacific Commission to conduct a study of medicinal plants in the Territory. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study we re to: 1. Determine the existing extent of the practice of indigenous medicine in American Samoa. 2. Collect, identify, and preserve the plants presently being used in American Samoa for medicinal purposes. 3. Determine how the plant material is being used , including preparation of the medicine and the illness for which it is prescribed. 4. Assemble available knowledge of the pharmacological properties of the plants being utilized, and if feasible, arrange for chemical analysis of those plants that have not previously been investigated. 5. Attempt to ascertain the relative degree of usefulness of indigenous medicine in treating various illnesses, and the potential dangers. 6. Determine the role of indigenous medicine in the life of the Samoan people. 7. Investigate alternative methods of integrating useful aspects of indigenous medicine with the government system of Western medicine. METHODOLOGY Knowledge of Medicinal Plant Usage Through the efforts of the Associate Health Planner of the Office of Comprehe nsive Health Planning, four well-known and respected taulasea agreed to cooperate in the initial phase of the study. These taulasea (two men and two women) met once a week with the Associate Health Planner and the Director of Comprehensive Health Planning to discuss the treatments and alternative treatments for every Samoan illness they could recall at that time. A subsequent trip to Ta'u, Olosega, and Ofu islands of the Manu'a group brought the study group into contact with taulasea from that area, who fu rnished additional information. Collection of Plants Using the list of plant names compiled from the treatment information, several of the taulasea went with the research group into the field where the plants were located, and specimens collected, during which time photographs were taken of the plants in their natural habitat. At a later date, a botanist accompanied the researcher and a person familiar with the local plants into the field and collected additional specimens. Many specimens were sent to t he herbarium at the Bishop Museum, where they have been preserved as voucher specimens for future reference. Preservation of the Plants Some of the plant specimens were press -dried in an air -conditioned room, while other specimens were press dried in an o ven at 150\u00ba F. Wherever possible, the flowers, fruit and/or seeds of the plants were also preserved. Finally, the dried specimens were permanently mounted on a 10\" x 14\" white art -board, along with a photograph of the live plant and a brief description o f the plant, including: Samoan name, scientific name, characteristics, and medicinal use. Identification of the Plants The American botanist, Dr. Art Whistler, who was working in Western Samoa on a research project, was engaged to come to American Samoa to identify and classify all of the plant species that were collected. Samoan Medicinal Plants 3Dr. Whistler has been in the Samoan Islands conducting botanical studies for many years and is also familiar with the Samoan names of the plants in this area, which proved to be of great value in eliminating errors. FINDINGS Concept of Illness The causes of illness, within the realm of present day \"bush -medicine\", fall roughly into three classes: 1. those caused by aitu; 2. those resulting from the adverse effects of the internal or e xternal environment, i.e. parasites, diabetes, to 'ala, effects of heat, etc.; and, 3. those caused by trauma. In addition, many taulasea in Samoa today recognize to some degree, the germ causation of illnesses. Trauma -caused illnesses are the most straigh t-forward of the three, and are in most cases clearly identifiable with the causative injury. Probably one of the most interesting, and least understood, concepts of illness is the idea of the displaced, or branching -out, of what is called the to'ala. The word to 'ala in the Samoan language has two meanings; it means the female reproductive organs, and also refers to a nebulous kind of \"life essence\" residing in the upper abdomen when an individual is healthy. It is when this to 'ala moves from its proper location that trouble arises. If for unknown reasons the to 'ala is displaced or travels to some other part of the body; the eye, the head, an extremity, etc.; pain and other adverse symptoms result. The treatment is fofo, or directional massage, aimed at f orcing the to 'ala back through the body to its proper site in the upper abdomen, thereby hoping to relieve the symptoms. Aitu-caused illnesses comprise a large group of maladies, ranging from symptoms of mental illness, to direct internal or external physi cal manifestations. In the case of an aitu -caused disease, it is believed that the spirit of a dead person enters the body of the affected person, causing him to become ill in mind or body. The spirit may be that of a deceased relative or village member, who is angry because of some wrong done to its former family, land, or village; or because of the breach of a social or religious taboo. Some aitu are well known by name and have continued to affect people down through the years, while others are believed to be incidental, i.e., that of a dead brother, aunt, etc. The same aitu may be the cause of many cases of illness, and manifestations of the spirit's harm may be different in each case. The similarity seems to pertain more to the nature of the offense r ather than to the type of illness. One of the more well -known aitu is described here to illustrate the \"epidemiology\" of an aitu caused disease in Samoa. The following is an account of the history of the aitu, Nifoloa, related by Mrs. Opapo, age 100 years (since deceased) from the village of Falelima, Western Samoa. Approximately 50 years ago, fishermen from the Ellice Islands went ashore at the village of Falelima, on the island of Savai 'i, in Western Samoa. The village people treated the Ellice Islande rs with great kindness and provided then with food and drink for their long journey home. Before leaving, one of the fishermen gave the villagers of Falelima his blessings for their kindness, saying that he had nothing worthy to repay the hospitality shown them. Instead, he gave the village a gift to protect everyone born and raised there. This gift (called tupua by Samoans) was a curse or aitu called Nifoloa , which could bring sickness and death to any person causing harm to, or feeling hatred for, the pe ople of Falelima wherever they might travel. Only another person from the village of Falelima was supposed to be able to relieve the stricken offender, who would otherwise eventually die from the \"spears\" or teeth of Nifoloa. Samoan Medicinal Plants 4Those who are stricken by Ni foloa suffer greatly from the very painful symptoms, called Oloa that can affect any part of the body, internally, or externally. The Oloa often begins as a small sore, or pimple, and grows rapidly causing much discomfort. Tropical sores may be attributed to Nifoloa, and are then treated with \"bush -medicine\" by a healer familiar with Oloa. The bush -medicine is used to wash away (fa'alanu ) the curse of the tupua, after which modern medicine is quite effective in treating the sores. Tetanus ( oloa ona ) is al so believed to be caused by Nifoloa. Symptoms of mental illness may also be attributed to Nifoloa. In these cases, aitu medicine is administered by a healer familiar with Nifoloa usually with dramatic effects. The treatment of aitu -caused diseases most o ften involves the use of Samoan plant preparations, as well as ritualistic actions and phrases. The medicine is not necessarily directed physically to the affected area, but may be used symbolically as part of the ritual, as in a certain treatment for mata pa'ia (eye injury), where the plant medicine is allowed to drip from a leaf cone onto the thumb nail of the patient in order to relieve the influence of the aitu on the eye. Some of the most interesting effects of aitu on the human body are those that ma nifest mentally in behavioral changes. Informants have related that these conditions may be mimicked by persons wishing to accomplish an end otherwise unobtainable, or to voice a wrong that has been done to the person when there is no other socially accep table way of making this known. The aitu may sometimes speak with its own voice, through the affected person, to answer questions as to who it is, and why it has inhabited the individual. Dramatic results are often effected by taulasea in cases of aitu ca used mental symptoms; often violent and uncontrollable by other means. Many times, treatment for a specific physical symptom (e.g., certain abscesses) will be combined with another treatment, directed at the aitu that is thought to be preventing the medic ine from healing the physical problem. Seeking Sources of Help The patterns people follow in seeking help for illnesses vary greatly with individuals and illnesses. Some people will go directly to the government hospital at the first sign of ill health; others will first try to treat themselves, or seek primary care from a taulasea or fofo. If the initial contact with a source of medical help does not prove satisfactory, the ill person may then try an alternative: from hospital to bush doctor; from bush doctor to hospital; or, from one bush doctor to another bush doctor. This complicated pattern is indicated diagrammatically in the following Figure. The advice of friends and relatives in the choice of the source of help has great influence on the patient' s decision in these matters, since when ill, people often put their trust in someone else rather than rely on their own judgement, even though they themselves may be better qualified to make these decisions. Samoan Medicinal Plants 5Figure . Arrows indicate patterns of seeking med ical help. Many taulasea will refer patients directly to the hospital when they realize that they are not able to help the person. If an initial brief period of trying their own medicine proves unsuccessful, most taulas ea will admit that they do not have the right treatment and recommend visiting the hospital, or another taulasea. This researcher could verify no cases where hospital staff had referred patients to a taulasea, but informants have indicated that such referr als do occasionally occur. A taulasea, after listening to the patient's description of his symptoms and the events leading up to the illness, will examine the patient. If it is felt that the particular treatment will work, the taulasea will tell the patie nt that he thinks he has the medicine that will help. He asks the patient to try it \"one time\" (which may mean for up to five days), and if it does not work, then to try a different healer or go to the hospital. There are some taulasea who have devised t echniques used solely for the purpose of advising the patient as to which taulasea has the treatment that will work for the patient; a sort of referral system. These people may use the bible or a deck of playing cards for this decision -making process. Types of Taulasea Some taulasea specialize in the treatment of certain kinds of illnesses. One may treat mostly children's illnesses; another, broken bones or sprains; another may specialize in treating aitu problems. Some are experts in massage, while other s specialize in the preparation of plant medicines. Those who possess the special knowledge and skills that make them successful \"chasers -of-the-aitu\" probably guard these processes with much more care than other taulasea, whose remedies may be general hou sehold knowledge. Almost every Samoan family has knowledge of many folk remedies that they use at home without the advice of a taulasea. A few taulasea also claim knowledge of potions to gain the love of the opposite sex. These recipes are the most closely guarded of all and their misuse may bring great harm or even death to the initiator. These recipes often contain an ingredient of powdered bone from a dead person, thus hoping to gain the help of the dead persons' aitu to achieve the desired end. Plant M edicine The practice of indigenous medicine in Samoa, like its counterpart scientific medicine, has changed considerably over the years. Many of the treatments used today are different from those used in the 1800's. Some treatments, however, have changed very little from the ones used in olden times. In addition to this historical difference, there is often great variety between individual taulasea in the Hospital or Dispensary Home Village Healer Village Healer Village Healer 1 2 3 Initial Contact Secondary Contacts Samoan Medicinal Plants 6treatments used for the same illnesses. It appears as though some taulasea add their own favorite pl ant ingredients to the remedy, hoping to augment the effectiveness of the mixture. A good example of the readiness of village healers to experiment with new remedies is the recent development of a new medicine that was compounded and first tried during the course of this study. This medicine was put together as a treatment for cancer. The medicine consists of the juice of the pounded roots of the 'aoa amulega ( Vitex trifolia ). The juices are left to stand until the solids settle to the bottom of the container. The clear fluid is then drained off, and a dosage of 1/2 glass, twice a day, is administered to the patient. The seeds of leva contain a poiso n used to stupefy fish. The healer who developed this medicine sees cancer as analogous to a moss growing on a tree that eventually kills the tree. The healer has tried this mixture on himself and also recommended it to a friend who tried it. Neither ha s suffered any observable ill effects! (Note: this is not an endorsement.) Almost all parts of plants are used for medicine. Some remedies call for the use of leaves; others, the roots; others, the bark; etc. Often, plants are used in combination to prep are a compound medicine. Sometimes, special care is taken in the selection of the plant parts; i.e. only the young leaves, or only those leaves facing the sun. When the bark of a tree is used, it is almost invariably the live inner bark. The dead outer bark is scraped off, the inner bark is scraped, and the shavings are used to prepare a brew. When an internal medicine is to be made for drinking, it is usually prepared in the following manner: leaves are pounded or finely chopped, placed in a cloth and w rung, or steeped in water (cold, warm, or boiling). The shavings of the inner bark of trunks, branches, stems, or roots are prepared in a like manner. When medicines are applied externally, the crushed leaves or the expressed juice is usually applied directly. In the past, many of these medicines were applied by chewing the plant part and allowing the juice to drip from the mouth or by spitting the pulp onto the affected area. These methods are still used to a limited extent today. The dosage is usuall y determined by the age of the patient, and the medicine is diluted to the satisfaction of the taulasea. Some medicines are prepared ahead of time and kept in jars in the refrigerator. The ingredients and instructions for medicinal preparations are given in the Appendix listed by Samoan illness name.

The truth is, that in many instances the village healer is m ore capable of producing consumer satisfaction than the hospital. This stems in part from the various reasons why people seek help, and the \"felt needs\" of people when ill. It also has much to do with what people have come to expect from scientific medic ine in terms of cures. The latter is influenced by the changing nature of illness and a misunderstanding of the capabilities of modern medicine. Studies have shown that between 60 -80 percent of the people who seek primary medical care have nothing physica lly wrong with them, or have symptoms of a minor nature such as a common cold, which would not benefit from medical intervention. For these people, what is really needed is sympathy and understanding; a feeling that someone cares that they feel bad and is willing to listen to their complaints and perhaps give them some reassurance that nothing seriously is wrong, plus some \"token\" medicine or lomi lomi to justify their feelings of illness. The Samoan village healer is vastly better able to provide this ki nd of care than the hospital outpatient department of the LBJ Tropical Medical Center. This detail is not to be taken lightly since a significant aspect of medicine is the early return of people to a productive role in society and much of the time lost fro m work is due to people who just plain \"don't feel well\". The taulasea has few patients and has enough time to talk with each one, listen to all their complaints, possibly give the patient a drink of some soothing herb medicine, and apply lomi lomi if needed. The doctor/patient relationship between the village healer and his client in these situations is the significant factor; not the medicine itself, which may have no pharmacological activity whatsoever. This is in sharp contrast to the environment of t he outpatient clinics that are invariably crowded with patients, (many of whom are those who only \"feel ill\"), forcing the doctors there to spend only a brief time with each patient, thus contributing to the inevitable feeling that \"the doctor doesn't real ly care about how the people feel\". This environment, in turn, injures the doctor's feelings of accomplishment and negates feelings of personal commitment to the patient. It makes the doctor feel as though he or she is not practicing medicine on a person -to-person level, but is only a part of the institutional practice of medicine. This is contrary to the Samoan culture, and the feeling is carried psychologically to the patient. The emphasis in this setting is on the prescription of medicine rather than o n a personal relationship between the doctor and the patient. A great deal is to be said also for the lomi lomi associated with much of the village healers' treatments. This \"laying on -of-hands\", so to speak, is a significant part of the treatment since i t has much to do with imparting a feeling of reassurance to the patient, hence assisting a rapid recovery to a productive role. The factor of patient expectations is also important. People have been led to expect medical miracles from scientific medicine, and its \"magic pills\". Earlier successes in the treatment and/or eradication of infectious diseases like yaws, T.B., diphtheria, filariasis, acute infections, etc., have led people to expect instant cures for all illnesses by pills, or shots. The truth is a large proportion of serious illnesses are due to chronic illness; illness that in most cases cannot be cured, and can only be controlled through prolonged management of the patient's diet and activities. Through education, people need to become aware that scientific medicine does not have a medical cure for every illness and that the control of many illnesses takes time, including the cooperation of both patient and doctor. To try to sell modern medicine as a \"cure -all\" while denigrating all village t reatment as completely useless does great injury to the confidence of the local people in the Medical Centers' ability to meet their health and medical needs, particularly when these same people can recount personal instances when they were not satisfied w ith the results of hospital medicine. In the final analysis, the consumers' evaluation of the quality of medical care can be reduced to the simple question of \"does it work?\" Samoan Medicinal Plants 81 On the other hand, one cannot deny that there are grave dangers associated with the indiscriminate use of bush medicines in treating illness. The bush -doctor, lacking the sophisticated diagnostic tools available to medical doctors, is ill equipped to recognize serious disease. Using traditional skills, the 'bush -doctor' may prolong ineffective treatment in such serious conditions as cancer, diabetes, eye diseases, serious infections, tetanus, etc.; that can lead to conditions that are much more difficult to treat, and even to untimely death, or disability. Some way of dealing with t his unnecessary danger to peoples' health must be worked out between the hospital and the taulasea. Evidence of this very real danger is frequently seen at the pediatric clinic of the LBJ Tropical Medical Center. Many children are encountered there who ha ve been treated ineffectively in the village with 'bush -medicine' for gastrointestinal disease and other conditions. When finally brought to the hospital, many of these children, some only infants, are dehydrated, acidotic and suffering from electrolyte i mbalance. Sometimes they are so gravely ill when seen by the medical doctor that nothing can be done to help them, and they become another unnecessary death statistic. Other children have been admitted to the hospital with symptoms suspected of being the direct result of the ingestion of bush - medicine. Few, if any, cases of actual acute bush -medicine poisoning, however, are seen. This is possible because of the way in which indigenous medicines have evolved. The medicines being used are the results of a trial and error process, which over many years, has enabled the taulasea to identify and discard those treatments that produced easily recognizable adverse reactions. No information is available on the long term, or insidious effects of bush -medicine ing estion. Potential danger is also associated with the use of fofo and lomi lomi as a treatment process. The rupture of internal abscesses is a possible result of over vigorous massage. Also, the use of fofo for broken bones, which have not been properly s et, can result in a person being crippled for life, or in the eventual loss of the limb. CONCLUSION Indigenous village medicine has been, is being, and will continue to be practiced in American Samoa so long as the village healer continues to meet those \"felt needs\" of the population that cannot be effectively addressed by the government health services system. Much can be learned from examining the reasons why people continue to seek the help of the village healer. This knowledge could aid in the devel opment of a more culturally acceptable mode of delivering government health services without sacrificing high quality, and scientifically sound medical care. Admittedly, constraints such as small numbers of medical staff, limited patient care time, high st aff turnover, and general resistance to innovation in the delivery of institutional government medicine make such change difficult to achieve. Perhaps some degree of integration of the natural and humanistic qualities of traditional medicine with the scien tific knowledge and technology of modern medicine can eventually be attained within the ultimate result of improved care for the people. This will be difficult because of the pioneering nature of such an endeavor and the lack of any previous body of evide nce to support the idea of a potentially successful marriage of the old and the new. To be successful it would take the full commitment of the highest government authority, as well as a willingness of government medical staff to cooperate in such a social experiment, as well as a massive coordinated public education program. The obstacles may be insurmountable, and only a marginal degree of success might be expected in any event. Nevertheless, the apparent benefits to be derived from the preservation and utilization of the best elements of the traditional healing art argue strongly for continued research and experimentation in this potentially fruitful and extremely interesting area.
