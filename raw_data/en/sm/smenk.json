The contract was awarded by the U.S.-based National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and National Institutes of Health (NIH). Crucell's [CRXL.O](/companies/CRXL.O) shares, which earlier touched a low of 10.60 euros, reversed their losses to reach a high of 11.60 euros, before slipping back. At 0942 GMT they were up 2.7 percent at 11.30 euros, still outperforming the Amsterdam midcap index [.AMX](/quote/.AMX) which was down 1.7 percent. \"The (stock's) response was an over-reaction,\" Marcel Wijma, an analyst at SNS Securities said, adding that the contract is an extension of an earlier one with the NIAID and NIH. Crucell said the deal provides funding of up to $30 million, with additional options that could yield a further $40 million. Spokeswoman Oya Yavuz said most of the funding will be paid to Crucell, while an undisclosed sum will be paid to secondary contractors U.S.-based Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research and UK-based Quintiles Guys Drug Research Unit. Ebola fever is one of the most lethal viral diseases, with a mortality rate ranging from 50 percent to 90 percent, according to the World Health Organisation. The Marburg virus is part of the same family that Ebola originates from. Crucell had already progressed through to a Phase I clinical trial for an Ebola vaccine using its PER.C6 technology before it put the development on hold, analyst Wijma said. He said Friday's contract involved a study using Crucell's AdVac technology aimed at developing a multi-virus vaccine to treat both the Ebola and Marburg viruses and could also prompt Crucell to restart development with the PER.C6 technology. Crucell's Yavuz said in the event of an outbreak, it often was not immediately clear whether it was the Ebola or Marburg virus, thus warranting the need for a vaccine targeting both.
