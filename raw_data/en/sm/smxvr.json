Initiate or intensify therapeutic lifestyle changes (National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III Guidelines) 2. Decrease statin dose 3. Discontinue statin and rechallenge at a later date 4. Reduce dose of statin and add ezetimibe 5. Use a different statin or statin -like supplement a. Fluvastatin b. Rosuvastatin at a low dosage c. Rosuvastatin once weekly or twice weekly or evey other day d. Atorvastatin, 10 -40 mg, 3 times weekly e. Red yeast rice, 1800 mg, twice daily Red Yeast Rice (RYR) RYR Chinese herbal supplement produced by fermenting white rice with a yeast, Monascus purpureus Contains Monacolins: inhibit HMGCoA reductase 90% (equivalent to a daily lovastatin dose of 5 -7 mg) is as effective as 20 to 40mg of lovastatin in cholesterol lowering effect (Heber, 1999, Am J Clin Nutrition) Red Yeast Rice (RYR) RCT in Statin Intolerance: RYR had 21% decrease with no increase in CPK or muscles symptoms Side Effects Similar to statins (SAMS), but lower incidence Rare: Kidney failure, liver failure Citrinin -mycotoxin contaminant Safety assessment of RYR products important Becker et al, 2009, Annals of Internal medicineRed Yeast Rice (RYR) Multicenter RCT comparing of Xuezhikang (XZK), a partially purified extract of RYR Nearly 5,000 Chinese patients with a prior myocardial infarction Red yeast rice extract showed a 45% reduction in coronary events 33% reduction in total mortality compared to placebo Lu et al, 2008, American Journal of Cardiology Berberine Alkaloid from Barberry, Goldenseal Dose Inhibits HMG Co -A reductase, inhibits PCSK9 (benefit in using with Statin) Can interact with statin metabolism (CYP2C9) Derosa et al, 2012, Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy, Dong, Planta Med, 2013, Na et al, 2012 Berberine Meta -analysis: reduces A1c 0.72 Dong et al, 2012, Evidence -Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Derosa et al, 2012, Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy Berberine Ju et al, 2018, PhytomedicineMeta -analysis from 16 RCT, 2147 participants: Decrease in LDL, in TG, neutral HDL Bergamot High in Flavonoids Inhibits HMG -CoA reductase , reduction -675 mg 20% decrease in LDL, 8 -10% increase in HDL; increases HDL and LDL size Gliozzi , IntJ Card, 2013 Toth , Front IntJ Card, component: Allicin Allicin is a thiosulfinate , produced after damage of the plant tissue by an enzymatic reaction Aged garlic extract in cell culture prevented endothelial cell dysfunction increased cellular concentrations of thiol antioxidants, such as cysteine and glutathione In folate 9 mg/dl, decreases oxLDL , HDL increase 1.5 mg/dl Reduced CAC Progression (7.5 vs. 22) over one year Improved Pulse wave velocity Dose: Aged Garlic (600 mg bid) Budoff et al, 2004, Preventive Medicine Yehet al, 2006, J of Nutrition Annals of IntMed, 2000 J Card D Res, 2012Curcumin Meta -analysis on effect on 2017, Frontiers in Nutrition Cocoa Flavanols McDermott, 2020, Circulation Research Cocoa Flavanols Double -blind RCT, 15 g of cocoa and 75 mg of epicatechin daily, improved 6 minute walk distance In calf muscle biopsies, cocoa improved mitochondrial COX (cytochrome c oxidase) activity ( ( P=0.098), and reduced central nuclei (P=0.033), compared with placebo McDermott, 2020, Circulation Research Conclusions Nutraceuticals have a significant effect on cardiovascular risk and include dietary supplements as well as functional foods Role as stand alone therapies as well as adjunctive therapies Mechanism of action can target many pathways Meta -analysis of several nutraceutical supplements have shown efficacy More rigorous research showing mechanisms as well as changes in cardiovascular risk or event reduction needed "}
