Addendum July 2016July 2016 Addendum Introduction The AHRQ evidence report on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome was published in December, 2014 and provided a literature review for the National Institutes of Health Pathways to Prevention Workshop on Advancing the Research on Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. 1, 2 The review found eight case definitions for either chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS), myalgic encephalomyelitis ( ME), or ME/CFS, and since its publication, an additional case definition was published by the Institute of Medicine along with the recommendation of a new name, Systemic Exertional Intolerance Disease. 3 The Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition is the least specific of the definitions and less generalizable to the broader population of pati ents with ME/CFS. It could identify individuals who have had 6 months of unexplained fatigue with physical and mental impairment, but no other specific features of ME/CFS such as post- exertional malaise which is considered by many to be a hallmark symptom of the disease. 3 As a result, using the Oxford case defi nition results in a high risk of including patients who may have an alternate fatiguing illness or whose illness resolves spontaneously with time. In light of this, we recommended in our report that future intervention studies use a single agreed upon case definition , other than the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition. I f a single definition could not be agreed upon, future research should retire the use of the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition. The National Institute of Health ( NIH) panel assembled t o review evidence presented at the NIH Pathways to Prevention Workshop agreed with our recommendation, stating that the continued use of the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition \"may impair progress and cause harm.\" 2 In light of this, we have received public comment requesting a separation of results based on case definition to appraise the impact of Oxford based trials on conclusions of the report. Additionally, the public has requested that we separate cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) from other counseling and behavioral interventions given that CBT is a specific therapeutic approach. The purpose of this addendum to our original report is to assess the impact of studies using the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition on conclusions and to assess the impact of separating studies of cognitive behavioral therapy from other counseling and behavioral interventions. Results What are the (a) benefits and (b) harms of therapeutic interventions for patients with ME/CFS, and how do they vary by patient subgroups? All intervention trials used a case definition for CFS as eligibility for trial inclusion. The results may not be applicable to individuals fulfilling criteria for ME or ME/CFS. Harms are generally poorly reported and conclusions surrounding harms are not impacted by this further analysis. 1 Medications Of the nine studies that met inclusion criteria for medical treatment of ME/CFS, eight studies used a CDC (Holmes or Fukuda) case definition for CFS4-11 and one study used the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition for CFS.12 This latt er study was the only trial comparing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (fluoxetine) with a placebo or graded exercise therapy and found no significant differences on measures of fatigue or function with fluoxetine although there were greater withdrawal s in the fluoxetine group (13% [9/68] vs. 3% [2/68] ). We previously found the evidence on fluoxetine 's effect on function or fatigue to be insufficient, such that consideration of the impact of the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition does not change this conclusion. Because the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition was not used in other medication trials , there remains low strength of evidence that Rintatolimod improves work capacity compared with placebo based on two randomized controlled trials 10, 11 and insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of all other medications reviewed. Complementary and A lternative Medicine Therapies Of the seven trials that met inclusion criteria for the use of a complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) approach in treating ME/CFS, five studies used the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definition13-17 and two studies used the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition.18, 19 The lat ter two studies included a trial by Weatherly -Jones et al ., that co mpared homeopathy with placebo and a trial by Williams et al., that compared melatonin with phototherapy or placebo. These trials as well as all of the other CAM trials were small, single studies, and there remains insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of diets, supplements, or phototherapy. Counseling and Behavior Therapies Of the 14 counseling and/or behavioral therapy trials included, several with multiple publications, eight compared CBT with another intervention or wait list control20-30 while six studies used a different counseling or behavioral technique.31-39 One of the CBT trials that used the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definition compared telephone CBT with face- to-face CBT and does not contribute to the addendum.2 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Two of seven remaining CBT studies used the Oxford case definition for eligibility (n=841)29, 30 (Table 1) , while five studies used case definitions that ultimately fulfilled the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definition ( n=800) (T able 2 ). Of note, one of these studies fulfilled both the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) and the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definition .22, 23 Any differences in findings between the studies using the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) and the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definitions are discussed by outcome below. Function Function was evaluated in six trials (n=932). Statistically significant between group improvement in measures of function were found with CBT in both trials using the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition (n=540)29, 30 and in two of the four other trials. (n= 174).22-26 Of the two trials that found no improvement, one trial found worsening function in the usual care group with stable function in the CBT group (F=9.12, p=0.004),20 and one trial found no difference, n=153.28 We performed a meta -analysis of four trials that considered the 36- item 2 Short Form ( SF-36) physical function subscale (range 0 -100) as an outcome (including one trial that used the Oxford [Sharpe, 1991] case definition) and found a trend toward improvement but no statistically significant difference ( weighted mean difference [ WMD ] 10.46, 95% confidence interval [ CI], -7.47 to 27.77, Figure 1 ). We repeated the meta- analysis excluding the single Oxford based trial and found similar results ( WMD 9.16, 95% CI , -10.28 to 28.6). We also repeated the meta-analysis excluding one trial that was an outlier and this found benefit from CBT with a more preci se point estimate ( WMD 6.02, 95% CI, 1.05 to 10.99). Two trials , one based on Oxford and one on CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definitions, used alternative measures of function. The Oxford based trial found benefit as measured by the Karnofsky Performance Scale (n=60), 29 while the CDC based trial found worsening function in the control group usi ng the Sicknes s Impact Profile 8 -items (n=60).20 Based on these results, the overall analyses of function outcomes, including the studies using Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition inclusion criteria, provided low strength of evidence that CBT improves function. In removing the two Oxford case definition based studies, we are left with four fair-quality studies, two finding benefit (n=174), one finding no benefit (n=153), and one finding stable function in the CBT group but worsening function in the usual care group (n=65). Unlike the positive results of the Oxford based trials, the results of the trials fulfilling the CDC criteria are mixed and would provide insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of CBT on the outcome of function due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision of results .

In removing the Oxford case definition based study, we are left with four fair -quality studies, three finding benefit (n=327) and one finding no benefit ( n=65), and one poor-quality study finding no benefit (n=58). The results are generally consistent with the overall conclusion and would provide low strength of evidence that CBT improves fatigue. Quality of Life Three trials assessed quality o f life (n=325) and all fulfilled the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definition.24-28 Two of three trials assessing quality of life did not find a benefit with CBT. The one trial tha t found an improvement with CBT was a small (n=58) poor- quality study,27 which leads to a low strength of evidence th at quality of life is not impacted by CBT. Employment Four trials, one with Oxford inclusion criteria (n=932) evaluated employment outcomes based on the work and social adjustment scale.20, 22 -26, 30 Two trials (n=540), one Oxford based (n=480) and one CDC based (n=60),22, 23, 30 found significant improvement for CBT compared with cont rols while two CDC based trials (n=179), found no benefit. Base d on these results, there is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of CBT on the outcome of work impairment whether the study using the Oxford definition is included or excluded . There is inconsistency between the mixed results of the three CDC based trials and the positive re sults of the one Oxford based trial. Global Improvement Two trials (n=5 40), one with Oxford inclusion criteria, evaluated global improvement and found benefit with CBT providing low strength of evidence that CBT benefits global improvement 22, 23, 30 By excluding the study that used the Oxford case definition, there would be insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of CBT on the outcome of global improvement although the results of the single CDC based trial are consistent with the Oxford based trial .

Counseling and Other Behavioral Therapies Two of the seven trials comparing counseling and other behavioral therapies with another intervention or a control used the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition (Table 3) ,31, 38 -40 while 5 the others used criteria that ultimately fulfilled the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definition (Table 4.24-26, 32 -37 Function Of the six trials evaluating measures of function (n=725), two used the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition for inclusion and both did not find improvement in function, n=301.31, 38 -40 Of the four trials fulfi lling the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definition, two found benefit (n=283),24-26,33,35 and two found no benefit (n=141).32,36 Four of the trials considered the SF-36 physical function subscale as the outcome measu re (Figure 2). Of these, none found statistically significant benefit. Two of the other trials (n= 183), one comparing self -instruction with wait list control and one comparing cognitive therapy with anaerobic activity therapy or relaxation , found improvement in meas ures of function.24-26, 33, 35 Overall, the analyses including the trials based on the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition provides low strength of evidence that counseling and other behavioral therapies do not improve function compared with controls. By excluding the Oxford case definition based trials, we are left with two trials finding benefit (n=283) and two trials , including one poor- quality trial, finding no benefit (n=141), which would provide insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of counseling and other behavioral therapies on the outcome of function. The CDC based results are mixed and thus inconsistent with the Oxford based studies, which found no improvement. F igure 2.

Considering only the four trials that used the CDC based criteria for inclusion, three tr ials found benefit (n=310), and one trial found no benefit (n=114), which would provide low strength of evidence that counseling and other behavioral interventions improve the outcome of fatigue. The CDC based results are consistent with the Oxford based results demonstrating improvement in fatigue up to 6 months. Quality of Life Quality of life was evaluated in two trials using criteria that fulfilled the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definition for inclusion. One found no improvement with cognitive therapy (n=114) and one found improve ment with counseling compared with a wait list control (n=47). 34 This provides insufficient evidence that counseling and other behavioral therapies improves quality of life. Employment and Global Improvement Measure of employment was evaluated in one CDC based trial (n=114) with no improvement found when comparing cognitive therapy with anaerobic therapy or relaxation.24-26 No study evaluated the outcome of global improvement. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of counseling or other behavioral therapies on the outcomes of employment or global improvement. Table 3.

Summary The body of evidence on counseling and behavioral therapy is evenly sp lit in number of subjects from studies that used the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition (n=841) and studies that used the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definition (n=843). In the CBT evidence, more subjects were enrolled in Oxford based studies then CDC based studies (n=983 vs. n=722). In considering the overall results including our meta- analysis of studies using SF-36 physical function outcomes in combination with the two other studies that assessed function using alternative measures of function , we are left with a low strength of evidence that CBT improves function. When we remove both studies that used the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition f or inclusion, we are left with four trials with mixed results (n=392) which would provide insufficien t evidence of the effect of CBT on the outcome of function. There is inconsistency between resul ts from the CDC based trials and the Oxford based trials. For the outcome of fatigue, the overall results included a greater number of participants enrolled in the four trials that found benefit (n=807, including the Oxford based trial ) compared with the two trials that found no benefit (n=123 ) providing a low strength of evidence for benefit with CBT . By removing the single Oxford based study, we found consistent results with three 8 fair-quality trials finding benefit (n=327), one fair -quality trial finding no benefit (n=65), and one poor-quality trial finding no benefit (n=58) which would provide a low strength of evidence that CBT improves outcomes of fatigue. The conclusions for effect on quality of life has changed from a low strength of evidence of benefit when considering all counseling and behavioral interventions to low strength of evidence that CBT provides no benefit in quality of life based solely on studies that fulfilled a CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definition for inclusion. There would be insufficient evidence on the effect of CBT on employment outcomes when considering all trials as well as when excluding the single study that used the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition for inclusion criteria. The CDC based trials had mixed results whereas the Oxford based trial had positive results . The strength of evidence on global improvement is downgraded from moderate to low when considering CBT separately from other counseling and behavioral interventions based on two trials, one Oxford based and one CDC based, both finding benefit. It would be further downgraded to insufficient when considering only the one small study that fulfilled CDC based criteria for inclusion (1trial, n=60). When considering counseling and behavioral interventions other than CBT, two studies were Oxford based (n=301) and five were CDC based (n=471). Although there is enough variability amongst the other techniques that a meta- analysis might be inappropriate, all involve supportive guidance aimed at improving coping strategies and reducing impact of one's disease state on overall well -being justifying the decision to consider these together as a group . Although CBT is a unique approach with disputable underlying rationale regarding the fear avoidance theory contributing to the perpetuation of symptoms in ME/CF S, it has similar aims of improving coping strategies and improving overall well-being. We considered this as justification for our original approach of combining all interventions when determining the overall strength of evidence of this body of literature. By separating these interventions from CBT, and co nsidering the overall results, there is low strength of evidence that counseling and other behavioral therapies excluding CBT provide improvement in fatigue , low strength of evidence for no improvement in outcomes of function, and insufficient strength of evidence for all other outcomes (Table 5). By removing the Oxford based studies, there would be a low strength of evidence that counseling and other behavioral therapies excluding CBT reduce fatigue (4 trials, n=424) with the mixed results being consistent with the results of the Oxford based trials. There would be insufficient evidence for all other outcomes. On the outcome of function t here is inconsistency between the mixed results of the CDC based and the negati ve results of the Oxford based trials. 9 Table 5 .

Three trials used the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition for inclusion , all of which evaluated the effectiveness of graded exercise therapy (GET) .12, 30, 41 Of the three trials using the CDC (Fukuda,1994) case definition, one trial evaluated the effectiveness of GET.42 The other two trials evaluated other exercise interventions and do not impact this addendum.43-45 Graded Exercise Therapy F our trials evaluated the effectiveness of GET compared with a control group (n=656) (T able 6, Figures 3 and 4). Of these, three used the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition (n=607)12, 30, 41 while one small trial used the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definition (n=49).42 The results are consistent across trials with improvement in function, fatigue, and global improvement and provided moderate strength of evidence for improved function (4 trials, n=607) and global improvement (3 trials, n=539), low strength of evidence for reduced fatigue (4 trials, n=607) and decreased work impairment (1 trial, n=480), and insufficient evidence for improved quality of life (no trials) (Table 7). By excluding the three trials using the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition for inclusion, there would be in sufficient evidence of the effectiveness of GET on any outcome (1 trial, n=49). Table 6.

This addendum has delineated differences in treatment effectiveness and harms according to case definitions, highlighting studies that used the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition and how these studies impacted our conclusions. Ad ditionally, r esults of studies evaluating CBT have been considered independently from other counseling and behavioral therapies. Our sensitivity analysis would result in a downgrading of our strength of evidence on several outcomes which can be attributed to the decrease in power , dominance of one large trial, or lack of trials using criteria other than the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition for inclusion. Blatantly missing from this body of literature are trials evaluating effectiveness of interventions in the treatment of individuals meeting case definitions for ME or ME/CFS . References 1.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.23970/AHRQEPCERTA219. ii Preface The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), through its Evidence- based Practice Centers (EPCs), sponsors the development of evidence reports and technology assessments to assist public - and pri vate-sector organizations in their efforts to improve the quality of health care in the United States. The National Institutes of Health requested and provided funding for this report to inform their Pathways to Prevention Workshop. The reports and assess ments provide comprehensive, evidence-based information on common, medical conditions and new health care technologies and strategies. They also identify research gaps in the selected scientific area, identify methodological and scientific weaknesses, suggest research needs, and move the field forward through an unbiased, evidence- based assessment of the available literature. The EPCs systematically review the relevant scientific literature on topics assigned to them by AHRQ and conduct additional analyses when appropriate prior to developing their reports and assessments. To bring the broadest range of experts into the development of evidence reports and health technology assessments, AHRQ encourages the EPCs to form partnerships and enter into collaboratio ns with other medical and research organizations. The EPCs work with these partner organizations to ensure that the evidence reports and technology assessments they produce will become building blocks for health care quality improvement projects throughout the Nation. The reports undergo peer review and public comment prior to their release as a final report. AHRQ expects that the EPC evidence reports and technology assessments, when appropriate, will inform individual health plans, providers, and purchaser s as well as the health care system as a whole by providing important information to help improve health care quality.

This systematic review summarizes research on methods of diagnosing myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and benefits and harms of multiple medical and nonmedical treatments. It identifies evidence gaps and limitations to inform future research. Data s ources . Searches of electronic databases included MEDLINE \u00ae (1988 to September 2014), PsycINFO\u00ae (1988 to September 2014), and the Cochrane Library (through the third quarter of 2014). The searches were supplemented by reviewing reference lists, seeking suggestions from reviewers, and requesting scientific information from drug and device manufacturers. Review m ethods. Two inve stigators reviewed abstracts and full -text articles for inclusion based on predefined criteria. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus, with a third investigator making the final decision. Results. A total of 6,175 potentially releva nt articles were identified , 1,069 were selected for full-text review, and 71 studies in 81 publications were included (36 observational studies on diagnosis and 35 trials of treatments). Eight case definitions have been used to define ME/CFS; those for ME , requiring the presence of postexertional malaise, represent a more symptomatic subset of the broader ME/CFS population. Researchers are unable to determine differences in accuracy between case definitions because there is no universally accepted referenc e standard for diagnosing ME/CFS. The Oxford criteria are the least restrictive and include patients who would not otherwise meet criteria for ME/CFS. Self -reported symptom scales may differentiate ME/CFS patients from healthy controls but have not been adequately evaluated to determine validity and generalizability in large populations with diagnostic uncertainty. Fourteen studies reported the consequences of diagnosis , including perceived stigma and the burden of misdiagnosis, as well as feelings of legitimacy upon receiving the diagnosis of ME/CFS. Of the 35 trials of treatment, rintatolimod compared with placebo improved measures of exercise performance; counseling therapies and graded exercise treatment (GET) compared with no treatment, relaxation, or s upport improved fatigue, function, and quality of life, and counseling therapies also improved employment outcomes. Other treatments either provided no benefit or results were insufficient to draw conclusions. GET was associated with higher number s of repo rted adverse events compared with counseling therapies or controls . Harms were generally inadequately reported across trials. Limitations. Diagnostic methods were studied only in highly selected patient populations. Treatment trials were limited in number and had small sample sizes and methodological shortcomings. Conclusions. None of the current diagnostic methods have been adequately tested to identify patients with ME/CFS when diagnostic uncertainty exists. Rintatolimod improves exercise performance in some patients (low strength of evidence), while counseling therapies and GET vi have broader benefit but have not been adequately tested in more disabled populations (low to moderate strength of evidence). Other treatments and harms have been inadequately st udied (insufficient evidence). More definitive studies are needed to fill the many research gaps in diagnosing and treating ME/CFS. vi i Contents Executive Summary ................................................................................................................

Strength of Evidence Table x Executive Summary This systematic review was commissioned by the Office of Disease Prevention at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), sponsored by the NIH Office of Research on Women 's Health , and cosponsored by the Trans- NIH Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) Research Working Group to inform the NIH 2014 Pathways to Prevention Workshop, an evidence-based methodology workshop. The purpose of the workshop is to develop a research agenda. Accordingly, this review evaluates and sum marizes research on methods for diagnosis of ME/CFS and the benefits and harms of treatments, and identifies gaps and limitations of current studies and needs for future research in these areas. Background ME/CFS is a condition characterized by chronic an d disabling fatigue, as well as various additional manifestations , including neurological and cognitive changes, motor impairment, pain, sleep disturbance, and altered immune and autonomic responses.1-4 Experts consider postexertional malaise and impairment of memory or concentration as critical components.5-7 Consistent with the NIH Workshop, this review uses the combined term ME/CFS to describe the condition. The etiology of ME/CFS is not known, and there is uncertainty whether the condition reflects a single pathologically discrete syndrome, whether ME and CFS are subsets of the same illness, and whether ME/CFS is a nonspecific condition shared by other disease entities. Numerous studies have attempted to identify risk factors for developing ME/CFS, but none are definitive. The diagnosis of ME/CFS relies on the use of clinical criteria to distinguish it from other conditions that may also present with fatigue. There are currently eight published case definitions with clinical criteria. 1-3,8-12 All include persistent fatigue not attributable to a known underlying medical condition, as well as additional clinical signs and symptoms. Depending on the case definition, prevalence rates of ME/CFS in the United States range from 0.3 percent to 2.5 percent. 13-15 Currently, no medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (F DA) for the treatment of ME/CFS, but several have been used \" off label. \" In practice, there are wide variations in the clinical management of patients, and many patients receive a multifaceted approach to treatment. Scope of Review This review includes stu dies of adults with symptoms related to ME/CFS. Outcomes from treatment trials include improved function, fatigue, quality of life, and involvement in daily activities. Included studies were conducted in clinical settings relevant to health care practices in the United States. Scientists from the NIH and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and a panel of experts and patients worked with the systematic review investigators to consider the context and studies related to the Key Questions that guided the review. These are\u2014 K ey Question 1. What methods are available to clinicians to diagnose ME/CFS , and what conditions are required to be ruled out or excluded before assigning a diagnosis of ME/CFS? (a) What are the accuracy and concordance of met hods used to diagnose ME/CFS? (b) How does the use of these methods vary by patient subgroups? (c) What harms are associated with diagnosing ME/CFS? ES-1 Key Question 2. What are the (a) benefits and (b) harms of therapeutic interventions for patients with ME/CFS , and how do they vary by patient subgroups? (c) What are the characteristics of responders and nonresponders to interventions? Methods This systematic review follows established methods of AHRQ's Effective Health Care Program.16 A research librarian conducted electronic database searches identifying articles published between 1988 and September 2014. Searches were supplemented by references identified from a dditional sources, including suggestions from panel members and reviewers of the draft report. Criteria for including studies were developed based on relevance to the Key Questions. Two investigators independently reviewed all potential articles for eligibility, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus, with a third investigator making the final decision as needed. Only English -language articles were included. For questions regarding diagnostic methods, studies were included that co mpared case definitions (e.g., Fukuda/Center s for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], Canadian, International) and provided measures of agreement, or tested the ability of the method to identify ME/CFS patients using one of the case definitions as a refe rence standard . Studies of potential harms from diagnosis were also included, such as psychological harms, labeling, risk from diagnostic tests, and misdiagnosis. For questions regarding treatment, studies were included that enrolled patients diagnosed with ME, CFS, or both by fulfilling criteria from at least one case definition. Randomized controlled trials of at least 12 weeks in duration that compared medications, complementary and alternative medicine approaches, counseling and behavior therapies, and exercise therapies with no treatment or other types of treatment were included . For completeness, additional trials of medications that were designed for shorter durations of treatment were separately summarized. Treatment outcomes included improved function, fatigue, quality of life, and involvement in daily activities. Studies of the results of laboratory tests or studies focusing on individual symptoms were not included. Two investigators extracted data from each included study, and independently rated t he quality of the methods of each study based on predefined criteria. Results of some of the treatment trials were statistically combined using meta -analysis. The overall strength of evidence was assessed for each Key Question and outcome in accordance wit h established methods. Experts in ME/CFS, individuals representing interest groups, and the expert and patient members of the panel were invited to review the draft report. The draft report was also posted for public comment during September and October 2014. Results Diagnosis Thirty -six observational studies of methods to diagnose ME/CFS were included. Most studies enrolled predominantly female patients, had small sample sizes, and were conducted in the United States and Western Europe. ES-2 Key Question 1. What methods are available to clinicians to diagnose ME/CFS , and what conditions are required to be ruled out or excluded before assigning a diagnosis of ME/CFS? Eight case definitions that include clinical criteria have been developed to identify patients with ME/CFS and are used by clinicians to distinguish ME/CFS from other conditions that also present with fatigue (Table A ).1-3,8-12 Although most case definitions require that other conditions be excluded prior to assigning a diagnosis of ME/CFS, no studies compared strategies for ruling out alternative diagnoses. The Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition incorporates the smallest number of symptoms (new onset of fatigue with impairment of physical and mental function), suggesting less specificity for ME/CFS. 12 Table A.

Key Question 1a. What are the accuracy and concordance of methods used to diagnose ME/CFS? Diagnostic methods were evaluated in eight descriptive studies comparing case definitions, although the accuracy of each method could not be determined because there is no established reference standard. Patients diagnosed using clinical criteria for ME or ME/CFS had more severe symptoms or impairment than those diagnosed using criteria for CFS alone. The Oxford CFS (Sharpe, 1991) and the London ME (Dowsett, 1994) case definitions were not compared in studies, leaving uncertainty as to their comparability. 5,14,18 -22 Three studies that compared CFS patients diagnosed using the CDC (Holmes, 1988, or Fukuda, 1994) case definitions versus patients with other diseases identified differences in reported symptoms using various self- reported symptom scales.18,23,24 These results suggest that some scales could be reasonable candidates for further evaluation as diagnostic tests (Fatigue Impact Scale, Chalder Fatigue Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, and certain subscales or combinations of the 36-Item Short Form survey [SF-36] with the Zung Depression Scale). However, these measures have not yet been evaluated for this purpose. No studies evaluated whether diagnostic methods could adequately identify clinical subgroups of patients. Eleven studies evaluated other types of methods to diagnose ME/CFS, but results were inconclusive. These included studies using self- reported symptom scales (the artificial neural network test, the Schedule of Fatigue and Anergia for CFS scale, subscales of the SF -36, and ES-3 other scales) and various serum biomarkers.25-36 The artificial neural network test was able to differentiate ME/CFS patients from healthy controls; however, no studies evaluated this method or other methods using an adequate sample size and spectrum of patients. No studies demonstrated an accurate and reliable method for identifying patients or subgroups of patients with ME/CFS in comparison with other patients, with diagnostic uncertainty as to whether they have ME/CFS or another condition in which fa tigue is a prominent symptom. Key Que stion 1b. How does the use of these methods vary by patient subgroups? Three studies described how methods for diagnosis may differ for patient subgroups.17,33,34 One study reported that older patients were more impaired, but it did not consider how symptom evaluation might vary with age. Two studies found that results of cardiopulmonary exercise tests were different for ME/CFS patients and healthy controls, and that certain subscales of the SF -36 were associated with slow recovery after exercise. No studies evaluated differences in the performance of case definitions among patients with specific sets of symptoms (autonomic/neuroendocrine, neurological/neurocognitive, immunologi cal/infectious). Key Question 1c. What harms are associated with diagnosing ME/CFS? Fourteen studies evaluated harms of the diagnostic process or diagnosis of ME/CFS, including the perceived harms (or benefits) of receiving a diagnosis of ME/CFS, as well as missed/alternative diagnoses. 13,37- 49 Five studies found that patients with CFS feel stigmatized by their diagnosis in terms of financial stability, work opportunities, perceived judgments on their characters, social isolation, and interactions with the health care system. 38,39,41 -43 Two studies indicated that medical trainees and mental health practitioners make judgments about a patient' s condition based on the name it carries (ME, CFS, or other) and what treatment is being given. 37,44 A substantial burden of misdiagnosis was found in the ME/CFS population.13,37,40,45,46,48 Treatment Thirty -five randomized trials of the benefits and harms of treatments for ME/CFS were included. Most had fair- or poor-quality research methods, enrolled predominantly female patients from ME/CFS specialty clinics based on the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) or Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definitions, had small sample sizes, and were conducted in the United States and Western Europe. Key Question 2. What are the (a) benefits and (b) harms of therapeutic interventions for patients with ME/CFS , and how do they vary by patient subgroups? Nine trials compared medical treatment of ME/CFS with placebo, although none of these medications have been approved by FDA for this indication.50-58 Results are summarized in Table B . Studies primarily included patients meeting CDC case definitions for ME/CFS (Fukuda, 1994, and/or Holmes, 1988), which identify less debilitated patients than those meeting ME case definitions. The immune modulator rintatolimod improved some measures of exercise performance compared with placebo in two trials (low strength of evidence), while trials of galantamine, hydrocortisone, immunoglobulin G, valganciclovir, isoprinosine, and fluoxetine ES-4 were inconclusive (insufficient evidence). Additional trials with durations less than 12 weeks indicated no differences between placebo and acyclovir59 and improved scores for physical health and function with rituximab,60 although both trials enrolled 30 or fewer participants and the clinical implications of these results are not clear. Harms of medications included suppression of adrenal glucocorticoid responsiveness, increased appetite, weight gain, and difficulty sleeping with h ydrocortisone; flulike syndrome, chills, vasodilation, dyspnea, and dry skin with rintatolimod; headaches with immunoglobulin G; discontinuation of treatment with fluoxetine; and nephrotoxicity with acyclovir.

None reported statistically significant clinical differences be tween treatment and control groups (insufficient evidence). Harms were not reported in the studies. ES-5 Table C.

Fourteen trials compared counseling or behavioral thera py versus usual care, no treatment, or other types of counseling or behavioral therapy ( Table D ) in ME/CFS patients diagnosed primarily by the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) or CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definitions.68-89 Results were mixed for most outcomes, but when considering all studies comparing any type of counseling with a control, counseling improved fatigue (7 of 11 trials showed positive effect), measures of functioning ( 4 of 11 trials showed positive effect; 2 of 11 showed mixed results on different measures), quality of life (2 of 4 trials showed positive effect), and global improvement (2 of 2 trials showed positive effect). Treatment effectiveness may not be generalizable to all patients because no study used a case definition that selected for more disabled patients (i.e., case definition for ME). When reported, harms of counseling and behavioral therapies were less with counseling compared with usual care, support, or adaptive pacing. ES-6 Table D.

Six trials evaluated exercise therapies, including graded exercise therapy (GET), qigong, and home orthostatic training, compared with no treatment or s everal other types of therapies in ME/CFS patients diagnosed primarily by the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) or CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definitions ( Table E ).57,89- 93 GET improved measures of fatigue, function, and clinical global impression of change compared with controls. Treatment effectiveness may not be generalizable to all patients because no study used a case definition that selected for more disabled patients (i.e., case definition for ME). Harms were not well reported, although in one trial patients receiving GET reported more adverse events compared with those receiving cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), adaptive pacing, or usual care; one trial reported more withdrawals of patients receiving GET , one trial had a high percentage of patients refusing repeat exercise testing , and several other trials reported more withdrawals of patients receiving GET , all compared with controls.

Four trials described characteristics of patients more likely to respond to therapies for ME/CFS. Younger patients with less impairment and less focus on their symptoms who were adherent to therapy (e.g., readings, sleep diaries, activity goals, relaxation) were more likely to improve on some measures of fatigue and/or function.68,74,87,92 Avoiding over exercising and underexercising (i.e., staying within one' s energy envelope) was also beneficial. This evidence is ES-8 insufficient, however, because these results have not been duplicated and the ir applicability to other patients is not known. Conclusions Eight case definitions for ME/CFS exist, and several diagnostic methods have been studied. Case definitions with criteria for ME and ME/CFS that require symptoms of postexertional malaise, neurological impairment, and autonomic dysfunction identify patients with more impairment, lower functioning, and more severe symptoms than case definitions with criteria for CFS alone. However, none of the case definitions or other diagnostic methods have been adequately tested to determine how well they differentiate patients with ME/CFS from patients with other conditions. No studies evaluated how diagnostic tests vary by patient subgroups or how to rule out related conditions before making an ME/CFS diagnosis. Studies indicated that an ME/CFS diagnosis is associated with perceived stigma, financial instability, difficulty in social interactions and relationships, and a greater chance of receiving a psychiatric diagnosis. One study identified feelings of legitimacy upon receiving the diagnosis of ME/CFS. Thirty -five trials of treatments included medication, complementary and alternative medicine approaches, counseling or behavioral therapy, and exercise therapy. Two trials of rintatolimod showed improvement in some measures of performance, while one trial showed improvement in fatigue, activities of daily living, and reduc ed use of other medications for relief of ME/CFS symptoms. Single trials enrolling only 30 participants reported improved measures of fatigue with valganciclovir and improved physical health and function scores with rituximab. The benefits of pollen extrac t, homeopathy, and L -carnitine preparations remain uncertain, because improvement was found in some but not other measures of the same outcome and between group comparisons were not evaluated. When all counseling and behavioral therapy trials were combined, measures of fatigue and global improvement were significantly improved, although results were not consistent across all trials. GET improved measures of function, global improvement, and to a lesser degree, fatigue. Although harms were not well reported across trials, GET was associated with a higher number of reported adverse evemts in some trials. For all other treatments, effects are uncertain because important outcomes were not measured, the study methods were inadequate, or too few participants were enrolled to provide useful estimates. Most treatments were evaluated in only a single trial and were conducted in referral settings. Participants ' baseline function and severity of symptoms were not usually reported, and it is not clear how well the results of the trials apply to clinical practice. Limitations The main limitation of this review is the lack of studies to address important questions, particularly regarding methods of diagnosis. Available studies generally enrolled small numbers of participa nts, and many treatment trials were too small to detect significant differences between groups. Most treatment trials did not describe their methods in sufficient detail to assess their quality. Studies used a variety of methods to measure outcomes, limiting comparisons across studies. While this review focused on outcomes that patients can experience, such as fatigue, a review of other types of outcomes such as postexertional malaise would provide additional evidence. ES-9 Future Research Case definitions: Consensus about which case definition is appropriate to use as the gold standard will further advance the study of diagnostic methods for ME/CFS . In the absence of consensus , future studies aimed at clarifying the diagnosis of ME/CFS should c onsider reporting how well a diagnostic test co mpares w ith m ore than o ne of the case definitions. Future research should retire the use of the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition given tha t it is a high risk of including patients w ho may have an alternate fatiguing illne ss, or whose illness resolves spontaneously with time. A national longitudinal registry of patients with a diagnosis of ME/CFS would allow for comparison of diagnostic criteria between patients and clarification of diagnoses over time. This strategy could a lso ide ntify a w e ll-characterized population for use in both diagnostic and tr eatment trials . Diagnostic instruments: Future studies evaluating the capability of diagnostic methods for ME/CFS should include a broad range of patients with conditions that re quire clinical distinction from ME/CFS, such as fibromyalgia and depression. Additionally, studies should report how well a particular method distinguishes ME/CFS from other conditions using standard performance measures, suc h as concordance, sensitivity, a nd specificity. Tr eatment trials: Definitive treatment trials require larger numbers of participants based on appropriate power calculations for primary outcomes to determine efficacy, and more rigorous adherence to methodological standards such as blinding of outcome assessors,intention -to-treat analysis, and strategies to minimize patients lost to followup . Future trials should enroll more men, more racial and ethnic minorities, and broader age ranges.Given the fluctuating nature of ME/CFS, followup periods greater than 1 year would helpdetermine effectiveness and harms over time. The development of a set of core outcome measures, including patient- centered outcomes, such as quality of life, employment, and time spent in activity, would helpguide re search and facilitate future analyses. Trial registries and collaborations would help consolidate and standardize data. Reporting more information about concomitanttreatments and adherence to treatment would improve the applicability of study findings.Similarly, stratification of results by patient characteristics, such as age, sex, race, and intermediate outcomes, would help determine the applicability of different treatments forspecific patients and situations. Studies should report findings according to importantfeatures of ME/CFS, such as postexertional malaise, neurocognitive status, andautonomic function, to identify subgroups that may respond differently to specifictreatments. Studies also need to report harms more completely to help identify patientsnegatively affected by certain treatments. Given the devastating impact that this condition has had on patients and families, researchers planning and developing trials should consider involving the patient and/or advocate voice so that future research is relevant and meaningful to those affected by ME/CFS.

ES-16 Introduction This systematic review was commissioned by the Office of Disease Prevention at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), sponsore d by the NIH Office of Research on Women's Health, and cosponsored by the Trans -NIH Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) Research Working Group to inform the NIH 2014 Pathways to Prevention Workshop, an evidence -based methodology wor kshop. The purpose of the workshop is to develop a research agenda. Accordingly, this review evaluates and summarizes research on methods for diagnosis of ME/CFS and the benefits and harms of treatments, and identifies gaps and limitations of current studi es and needs for future research in these areas. This systematic review is not intended to form the basis for treatment guidance. Background Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a multisystem debilitating condition characterized b y chronic and disabling fatigue, as well as various additional manifestations, including neurological and cognitive changes, motor impairment, pain, sleep disturbance, and altered immune and autonomic responses. 1-4 It follows a relapsing and remitting course that often leads to loss of independence and reduced quality of life.1 Experts consider post-exertional malaise/neuroimmune exhaustion (PEM) and memory or concentration problems as key components.5-7 Although reports of similar symptom clusters date bac k to the 1930s, the term myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) was first used to describe the condition in the 1950s and was recognized by the World Health Organization in the 1960s. 8 The term chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) was coined in the 1980s after research failed to identify a clear viral association with what was previously labeled chronic Epstein- Barr virus syndrome. 9-12 Other terms such as post viral fatigue syndrome and chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome have been used in an attempt to associate the syndrome with possible underlying etiologies.2,4,9,10 The most recent international consensus report advocates moving away from the term CFS in favor of the term ME to better reflect an underlying disease process involving widespread inflammation and neuropathology.3,7 Some feel that the lack of specificity surrounding the name, CFS, may delegitimize and negatively characterize the condition, and stigmatize patients.13,14 Consistent with the NIH Workshop, this review uses the combined term ME/CFS to de scribe the condition and includes studies using either ME or CFS criteria. Uncertainty persists regarding the etiology of ME/CFS, whether it is a pathologically discrete syndrome,3,7 whether ME should be considered a subset of CFS or its own distinct disea se,5 or whether the symptom set is nonspecific and shared by other disease entities. Some suggest that an inciting event triggers an immune response and promotes immune and/or neuroendocrine dysregulation that perpetuates the body 's response and symptom experience that becomes ME/CFS.15,16 Viral etiologies have been predominantly studied based on the observation that the majority of patients report a sudden onset of symptoms associated with a preceding febrile illness and enlarged lymph nodes. However, no specific virus or other infectious agent has been identified, and not all patients experience a preceding febrile illness. 15 Numerous studies have attempted to identify risk factors for developing ME/CFS. A systematic review in 2008 of 11 studies assessing predictive models of multiple risk factors found no evidence of any definitive factors. 17 For example, although some models found association with older age, women , and febrile viral illness, others did not.17 It is known that ME/CFS is more common among women 1 with the average age of diagnosis between 30 and 40 years.18 This review i s not intended to address the question of etiology nor underlying factors that lead to the onset or perpetuation of ME/CFS but rather to focus on the diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome. Diagnosing a patient with ME/CFS relies on the use of a set of c linical criteria (case definitions) to distinguish ME/CFS from other conditions that may also present with fatigue. There are eight published case definitions that have evolved since the first one was published by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven tion (CDC) in 198810 (Table 1 ). All but one of the definitions include persistent fatigue not attributable to a known underlying medical condition, as well as ad ditional clinical signs and symptoms that do not all need to be present to establish the diagnosis. 5 The case definitions overlap but vary greatly in their symptom set, leading to concern that they do not all represent the same disease or identify the same cohort of patients.7 The international ME consensus panel of experts recommends that patients meeting the International Consensus Criteria (ICC) be given the name ME, and that those meeting the criteria for CFS but not the ICC for ME be given the name CFS. 7 For this report we have considered all case definitions, recognizing that no ca se definition has been accepted as a reliable reference standard (\"gold standard \") and that unresolved issues persist.

As with other medical syndromes that involve a multitude of symptoms and lack a definitive diagnostic test, differentiating one disease state from another similar or overlapping condition becomes a challenge. Some clinicians are reluctant to diagnose ME/CFS, believing that the diagnosis will harm the patient or that the patient will be inappropriately labeled. 19 This makes the prevalence of ME/CFS difficult to as sess.18,20 The CDC reported a U.S prevalence rate of 0.3 percent corresponding to over 1,000,000 adults in 1997.21 By using different case definitions, the rate may be as high as 2.5 percent.9,22 A recent systematic review found that when using the same case definition (CDC Fukuda, 1994), the prevalence was higher when determined by self report (3.28%; 95% confidence interval [ CI], 2.24 to 4.33) compared with clinical assessment (0.76%; 95% CI, 0.23 to 1.29). 23 The prevalence and symptom patterning of childhood ME/CFS is similar but is more likely to develop after an acute flu -like or mononucleosis -like illness, and the prognosis appears to be better.24-26 The natural history of ME/CFS in adults is not well studied, but symptoms and disability in adults tend to persist over time.27 Although 40 perc ent (8 to 63%) of adult patients improve, only 5 percent (0 to 31%) fully recover,21 in contrast to 2 childhood studies that suggest that over 50 percent of patients will recover within 6 months.25 However, a recent review highlighted the variability in which studies defined recovery in adults, limiting the utility of this term as a meaningful outcome until a universal definition for recovery is accepted.28 The review authors recommended using a more global assessment that captured fatigue, function, and perception of health.28 Regardless, economic impact is considerable with most adult patients never returning to work.15,29 Currently there are no medications for the treatment of ME/CFS appr oved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but many have been used without review and approval ( \"off- label \"), and some have been obtained from other countries and are not currently approved for any indication in the United States (i.e., isoprinosi ne, rintatolimod). In an FDA survey, patients identified treatments that fell into two broad categories: those intended to treat the underlying cause of the disease and those targeting specific symptoms or perpetuating factors. 30 Medications to treat underlying causes include immune modulators, antivirals, and antibiotics. Interventions targeting symptoms include medications to treat specific symptoms such as pain, fatigue, autonomic dysfunction, and sleep dysfunction, and nondrug therapies such as yoga, exercise techniques, counseling, pacing strategies, and mental exercises. 30 In practice, there are wide variations in the clinical management of patients, and many patients receive a multifaceted approach to treatment. The variable symptomatology of ME/CFS, lack of a clearly identifiable etiology and/or disease process, and lack of an agreed upon reference standard for diagnostic testing have challenged researchers and clinicians in thei r attempts to better understand the condition and treat patients. This review summarizes the research on diagnosis and treatment of the syndrome, including the methods and criteria used to diagnose ME/CFS, their utility in differentiating patients with similar but distinct symptoms, the harms associated with carrying a diagnosis of ME/CFS, and the evidence on treatment effectiveness and associated harms. Although they are recognized as important components in advancing the research and understanding of ME/C FS, this review does not address theories surrounding etiology/pathophysiology nor intermediate outcomes of treatment, such as changes in biomarker values, as these topics will be addressed by other presenters at the workshop. This review identifies limita tions and gaps in the current state of the literature and how the existing research applies to patients in order to assist the P2P panel in their recommendations regarding future research. Scope of Review and Key Questions The research questions were developed by the P2P Working Group, that included experts and a patient advocate, and they focus on diagnosis and treatment of the syndrome ME/CFS. The analytic framework (Figure 1) and Key Questions used to guide this review are shown below. The analytic fram ework shows the target populations, interventions, and health outcomes examined, with numbers corresponding to the Key Questions . 3 Figure 1 . Analytic f ramework 4 The report focuses on the following K ey Q uestions : Key Question 1 . What methods are available to clinicians to diagnose ME/CFS , and what conditions are required to be ruled out or excluded before assigning a diagnosis of ME/CFS? Key Question 1a. What are the accuracy and concordance of methods used to diagnose ME/CFS ? Key Question 1b . How does the use of these methods vary by patient subgroups? Key Question 1c . What harms are associated with diagnosing ME/CFS? Key Question 2 . What are the (a) benefits and (b) harms of therapeutic interventions for patients with ME/CFS . and how do they vary by pati ent subgroups? Key Question 2c . What are the characteristics of responders and nonresponders to interventions? 5 Methods This systematic review follows the methods of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) \" Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews .\"31 Topic Development and Refinement The initial Key Question s were pr ovided by the Trans -National Institutes of Health ( NIH) myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome ( ME/CFS ) Research Working Group and further developed and refined in conjunction with the NIH Pathways to Prevention ( P2P) Working G roup. AHRQ with i nput from a Technical Expert Panel (TEP) convened for this report , further developed the approach to the review . The TEP consisted of experts in ME/CFS spanning six disciplines and two patients , who all disclosed no conflicts of interest that precluded participation . The investigators with the Pacific Northwest Evidence -based Practice Center strove to inform themselves of the disease ME/CFS by reviewing W eb sites, publications by advocacy groups, and viewing videos of patient experiences . A local infectious disease physician who has treat ed ME/CFS patients for almost 30 years also participated as a consultant throughout the topic refinement and systematic review process . Two attendees to the International Association for ME/CFS Biennial Conference in San Fra ncisco (March 2014) further informed the team of investigators to the current state of knowledge about the disease and assisted in identifying important o utcomes of interest to patients and researchers . With input from the TEP, the NIH, and AHRQ, the fina l protocol was developed and posted on the AHRQ W eb site on May 1, 2014 at: http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/search - for-guides -reviews -and-reports/?productid=1906&pageaction=displayproduct . registered in the PROSPERO inte rnational database of prospectively registered systematic reviews.32 Literature Search Strategy A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1988 to September 2014), PsycINFO (1988 to September 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through September 2014), and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and the National Health Scienc es Economic Evaluation Database (through the third quarter 201 4). See Appendix A for the search strategies . Searches were supplemented with hand searches of reference lists of relevant studies . In addition, scien tific information pack ets were requested from drug and device manufacturer s that potentially had data on the use of medications or devices for myalgic encephalomyelitis ( ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS); they had the opportunity to submit data using the portal for submitting scientific information packets on the Effective Health Care Program Web site. Seventeen submissions were received , but provided no research meeting inclusion criteria for this review. Process for Study Selection Criteria for inclusion and exclusion of s tudies w ere developed based on the K ey Q uestions and the populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing, types of studies, and setting (PICOTS) approach (Appendix B ). Papers were selected for review if they were about diagnosis or treatment of M E or CFS in adult populations, were relevant to a Key Question, and met t he 6 prespecified inclusion criteria. Studies of nonhuman subjects and studies with no original data were excluded . Abstracts were reviewed by two investigators for in clusion for each K ey Question. Full -text articles were obtained for all studies that either investigator identified as potential ly meeting inclusion criteria . Two investigators independently reviewed all full -text articles for final inclusion . Inclusion was restricted to English -language articles . A list of the included studies appears in Appendix C ; a list of excluded studies and primary reasons for exclusion can be found in Appendix D . Discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus, with a third investigator making the final decision if necessary . Population and Conditions of Interest For Key Question 1, studies of adults 18 years or older with a symptoms in which ME/CFS was a diagnostic consideration were included . For Key Question 2, studies of adults 18 yea rs or older, diagnosed with ME, CFS, or both by fulfilling criteria from at least one of the case definitions and without another underlying diagnosis were included . Studies varied in how they described which case definition they used; for consistency in t his report we have used the names identified i n Table 1 have been used throughout the report. To minimize heterogeneity in patient populations, we did not include studies in which patients who may have met criteria for ME/CFS were included as part of a bro ader grouping of an overlapping condition ( i.e., depression, fibromyalgia) were not included. Interventions, Comparisons, and Study Designs For Key Question 1, any diagnostic test or case definition (set of clinical criteria) for diagnosing ME/CFS w as included. Because there is no single accepted definition for ME/CFS and therefore no \"gold standard,\" any of the eight case definitions published since 1988 w as accepted as a reference standard and compared for similarities and differences. Measures of diagnos tic accuracy and concordance were considered . Diagnostic accuracy is a measure of how well the test can distinguish those who do and do not have the disease of interest and is measured by the model 's concordance statistic or c- stat. The c- stat is determine d by the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) which is a measure of discrimination, the ability of a test to distinguish people with a condition from people without the condition, and is based on the sensitivity and specificity of the test.33,34 An AUROC of 1.0 indicates perfect discrimination, and an AUROC of 0.5 indicates complete lack of discrimination and would result from chance alone. Interpretation of A UROC values between 0.5 and 1.0 is somewhat arbitrary, but a value of 0.90 to 1.0 has been cl assified as excellent, 0.80 to less than 0.90 as good, 0.70 to less than 0.80 as fair, and less than 0.70 as poor.35 Concordance refers to how well two tests agree . We excluded studies designed to inform etiol ogy and studies that reported on diagnosing a specific symptom of ME/CFS (e.g., post -exertional malaise36) without reporting on diagnosis of ME/CFS by comparing with a case definition as a reference standard . In the absence of studies reporting accuracy/concordance measures, descriptive studies comparing diagnostic clinical criteria were included. Fo r harms of diagnosis, studies that evaluated harms by surveys , qualitative interviews, or trials designed to identify perceptions of diagnosis or treatment for ME/CFS were included. For Key Question 2, we included randomized trials comparing medication management (immune modulators, beta blockers, antidepressants, anxiolytics, stimulants, other) , complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches (acupunctur e, relaxation, massage, other) , counseling and behavior therapy, and exercise therapies with placebo, no treatment, usual 7 care, or other active interventions, including combination therapies and head -to-head trials . For harms, cohort studies with control groups were also included. Outcomes For Key Question 1, outcomes of diagnostic accuracy or concordance were considered , including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, C- statistic, receiver operator curve (ROC) and area under curve (AUC), net reclassification index, concordance, and any potential benefit or harm from diagnosis (i.e., psychologica l harms, labeling, risk from diagnostic test, misdiagnosis ). For Key Question 2, outcomes were included if they were patient -centered and included patient reported measures considered clinically relevant , such as function ( e.g., 36-item Short Form Survey [ SF-36]), quality of life , days spent at work or school, proportion working full- or part-time, and f atigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory 20-item [MFI -20] or similar) . Fatigue was included as it was the only symptom that was universal to all case defi nitions. Other individual symptom- based outcomes (e. g., pain, sleep, memory, PEM ) and intermediate outcomes (e .g., biomarker values ) were excluded . Harms included, but were not limited to withdrawals , withdrawals due to harms , and r ates of harms due to interventions. Timing There was no duration or timing restriction on studies included for Key Question 1. F or Key Question 2, only studies with a minimum duration of 12 weeks of treatment were included , given the fluctuating nature of the condition character ized by an intermittent pattern of relapse and remission .37 Setting Studies for all Key Questions had to be conducted in a clinical setting or a setting that was generalizable to clinical practice settings . Studies conducted with inpatients or institutionalized individuals w ere excluded . Data Extraction and Data Management The following information was extracted from included studies into evidence tables : study design, setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria, population characteristics (including sex, age, race, and co -morbidities ), sample size, duration of followup, attrition, intervention characteristics, case definition used for diagnosis, duration of illness, and results. Data extraction for each study was performed by two investigators: the first investigator ex tracted the data, and the second investigator independently reviewed the extracted data for accuracy and completeness. Individual Study Quality Assessment The quality (risk of bias) of each study was assessed based on predefined criteria adapted from methods proposed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The criteria used are consistent with the approach recommended by AHRQ in the AHRQ Method s Guide. 31 The term \"quality\" was used rather than the alternate term \"risk of bias;\" both refer to inter nal validity . Two investigators independently assessed the quality of each study . Discrepancies were resolved 8 through discussion and consensus, with a third investigator making the final decision if necessary. To determine t he quality of each study evaluat ing diagnostic tests, we used questions from the AHRQ \" Methods Guide for Medical Test Reviews \"38 were adapted t o improve their clinical relevance to ME/CFS . Quality was based on whether the study evaluated a representative spectrum of patients , including patients with overlapping conditions and those with diagnostic uncertainty ; whether it enrolled a random or consecutive sample of patients meeting pre specified criteria ; whether it used a credible reference standard ; whether the same reference standard was applied to all patients ; whether the reference standard was interpreted independently from the test under evaluation ; and whether thresholds were pre specified .31,39,40 Given the lack of a universally accepted reference standard for ME/CFS, use of more broadly accepted research and clinic al criteria were accepted as a comparator (CDC, Canadian, and International definitions) . Descriptive papers that compared diagnostic criteria and reported harms were not quality rated . The quality of intervention trials was based on the methods used for randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding; the similarity of compared groups at baseline; maintenance of comparable groups; adequate reporting of dropouts, attrition, crossover, adherence, and contaminatio n; loss to followup; the use intent -to-treat and ascertainment of outcomes . 31,40 Following as sessment of individual quality criteria, individual studies were rated as \"good,\" \"fair,\" or \"poor\" quality, as defined below .31,38 Good- quality studies are considered likely to be valid . Good- quality studies clearly describe the population, setting, interventions, and comparison groups; use a valid method for allocation of patients to interventions; clearly report dropouts and have low dropout rates; use appropriate methods for preventing bias; assess outcomes blinded to intervention status; and appropriately measure outcomes and fully report results. Fair-quality studies have some methodological deficiencies, but no flaw or combination of flaws judged likely to cause major bias . The study may be missing information, making it difficult to assess its methods or assess limitations and potential problems . The fair -quality category is broad, and studies with this rating vary in their strengths and weaknesses: the results of some fair -quality studies are likely to be valid, while others are probably invalid. Poor -quality studies have significant flaws that may invalidate the results . They have a serious or \" fatal\" flaw in design, analysis, or report ing; large amounts of missing information; or discrepancies in reporting . The results of these studies are judged to be at least as likely to reflect flaws in the study design as true effects of the interventions under investigation. P oor-quality studies w ere not excluded a priori , but they were considered to be the least reliable studies when synthesizing the evidence, particularly when discrepancies between studies were present . For detailed quality assessment criteria see Appendix E. Assessing Research Applicability Applicability is defined as the extent to which the effects observed in published studies are likely to reflect the expected results when a specific intervention is applied to the population of interest under \" real-world \" conditions .31 It is an indicator of the extent to which research included in a review might be useful for informing clinical decisions in specific situations . Applicability depends on the particular question and the needs of the user of the review . There is no generally accepted universal rating system for applicability . In addition, applicability depends in part on context . Ther efore, a rating of applicability (such as \"high\" or \"low\") was not assigned 9 because applicability may differ based on the user of this review . Rather, factors important for understanding the applicability of studies were recorded , such as how similar patie nts were to the population of interest , how large the sample size was, and the characteristics of the clinical setting.41 The funding sour ce for treatment trials was also recorded. Data Synthesis Results of diagnostic accuracy studies (such as creating summary AUROCs ) were not quantitatively pool ed due to differences in methods, case definitions, and heterogeneity in the outcomes . Instead, descriptive statistics were used, such as the median sensitivity and specificity at specific cutoffs and reported AUROCs, along with associated ranges , and calculated positive and negative likelihood ratios based on the median sensitivities and specificiti es. For the results of intervention trials, the appropriateness of meta -analysis was determined by considering the internal validity of the studies and the heterogeneity among studies in design, patient population, interventions, and outcomes . Appropriate measures were chosen based on the type of data for meta -analysis, according to the guidance for the Evidence -based Practice Center Program.42 Random -effects models w ere used to estimate pooled effects .43 When only two studies were available we chose not to pool the results .43 We calculated pooled RR where the data were reported as proportions of dichotomous outcomes (e.g., proportion with improvement in intervention and control groups) . For continuous outcomes, we calculated pooled weighted mean differences using the means and standard deviations (SDs) (e.g. , mean change in function based on a scale) . The Q statistic and th e I-squared statistic (the proportion of variation in study estimates due to heterogeneity) were calculated to assess heterogeneity in effects between studies. 44,45 When statistical heterogeneity was found, we explored the reasons by using subgroup analysis . In meta -analysis, we combined RRs and ORs for such outcomes . Grading the Body of Evidence for Each Key Question The overall strength of evidence was assessed for each Key Question and outcome in accordance with the AHRQ Methods Guide .31,38 Strength of evidence was based on the overall quality of each body of evidence, the study limitations (graded low, moderate, or high); the consistency of results between studies (graded consistent, inconsistent, or consistency unknown when only one study was available); the directness of the evidence linking the intervention and health outcomes (graded direct or indirect); the precision of the estimate of effect, based on the number and size of studies and confidence intervals ( CI) for the estimates (graded pr ecise or imprecise) ; and whether reporting bias was suspected (graded suspected or undetected) . There was no way to formally assess for publication bias due to the small number of studies, methodological shortcomings, or differences across studies in desig ns, measured outcomes, and other factors . For a more detailed description of the categories used see Appendix F . Studies included to answer Key Question 1 were not formally evaluated for strength of evidence, but key concepts of strength of evidence are di scussed. The strength of evidence was rated for K ey Q uestion 2 using the four categories recommended in the AHRQ Methods G uide: 31,38 A \"high\" grade indicates high confidence that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcome . The body of evide nce has few or no deficiencies and the findings are stable ( i.e., another study w ould not change the conclusions) . A \"moderate \" grade indicates moderate confidence that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcome . The body of evidence has some deficiencies and findings are likely to be stable, but some doubt remains . A \"low\" grade indicates low confidence 10 that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcome . The body of evidence has major or numerous deficiencies (or both) and additional evidence is needed before concluding either that the findings are stable or that the estimate of effe ct is close to the true effect . An \"insufficient \" grade indicates inability to estimate an effect or no confidence in the estimate of effect for this outcome , no evidence is available or the body of evidence has unacceptable deficiencies, precluding reachi ng a conclusion. Peer Review and Public Commentary Experts in ME/CFS , individuals representing important stakeholder groups, and TEP members were invited to provide external peer review of this systematic review . The AHRQ Task Order O fficer and a designated Evidence -based Practice Center A ssociate Editor also provide d comments and editorial review . To obtain public comment, the draft report was posted on the AHRQ W eb site for 4 weeks in September and October 2014. The draft report was further edited in resp onse to these reviews and comments, and the specific responses were outlined in a table that will be made available after AHRQ posts the final systematic review on the public Web site. 11 Results Results of Literature Searches Results of the literature sear ch and selection process are summarized in the literature flow diagram ( Figure 2) .

Most were of fair -quality, e nrolled predominantly female patients, had small sample sizes, and were conducted in the United States and Western Europe . 12 Thirty -five randomized trials were included for Key Question 2, addressing the benefits and harms of interventions to treat myalgic e ncephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome ( ME/CFS ) (9 for medications ; 7 for complementary and alternative medicine [ CAM ]; 14 for counseling and behavioral therapies ; and 6 for exercise, including 4 comparing interventions ). Most were of fair - or poor -quality, enrolled predominantly female patients from ME/CFS specialty clinics based on the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) or Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition, had small sample sizes, and were conducted in the United States and Western Europe . Key Question 1 . What me thods are available to clinicians to diagnose ME/CFS , and what conditions are required to be ruled out or excluded before assigning a diagnosis of ME/CFS? Key Points Eight different case definitions have been used to identify patients with ME/CFS; all include a set of clinical criteria and are applied by clinicians . The Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition has the least overlap with other definitions . Most ME/CFS case definitions require that other conditions be excluded prior to assigning a diagnosis of ME/CFS ; however , no studies compared strategies for ruling out alternative diagnoses. Detailed Synthesis Case definitions have evolved since the first set of clinical criteria were published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in 1988 ( Table 2 below and Appendix I ).10 Despite being developed as consensus guidelines and with endorsement of national groups, none of these published case definition s is agreed upon as the single preferred method for distinguishing ME/CFS from other conditions that may also present with fatigue . The Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition requires the presence of the smallest symptom set (new onset of fatigue with impairment of physical and mental function) , suggesting less specificity for ME/CFS .46 Four definitions are labeled as myalgic encephalomyelitis ( ME) or ME/CFS and al l of these require the presence of post -exertional malaise ( PEM ). All case definit ions address the diagnostic workup that is required prior to diagnosing chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).2,3,47,48 In general, prior to diagnosing ME/CFS, other explanations for fatigue must to be ruled out . Recommendations for workup are included with the published case definitions, but no studies specifically evaluated diagnostic work up strategies or compared strategies for ruling out alternative diagnoses prior to assigni ng a diagnosis of ME/CFS . 13 Table 2.

What are the accuracy and concordance of methods used to diagnose ME/CFS ? Key Points Diagnostic studies of ME/CFS are limited by the lack of an accepted reference standard (case definition) or an agreed upon set of clinical criteria. Concordance was assessed in seven studies reporting variations in symptom prevalence in populations that are defined by different case definitions . Three studies evaluated case definitions by comparing ME/CFS patients with other populations. Patients identified by clinic al criteria labeled as ME or ME/CFS had more severe symptoms or more functional impairment than those identified by clinical criteria labeled as CFS . Patients with ME or ME/CFS had more severe symptoms than healthy control patients and some groups of patie nts with other chronic diseases. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of clinical criteria for the diagnosis of ME/CFS were assessed in 11 studies ; none provided evidence that a single set of clinical criteria is better than other criteria at differenti ating ME/CFS from other conditions that may also present with fatigue however the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition has not been formally compared with other case definitions nor ev aluated for diagnostic accuracy or concordance. Three studies, one good - and two fair-quality, found that computerized modeling can have good sensitivity and specificity for identification of patients who meet one of the ME/CFS case definitions when compared with healthy controls . These have not been tested in a clinical setting or in patients with diagnostic uncertaint y. Detailed Synthesis Evaluation of accuracy of a diagnostic test generally requires an accepted diagnostic reference standard (\"gold standard\" ). Diagnostic studies of ME/CFS are limited by the lack of a single accepted reference standard . The use of clinical criteria is the accepted approach to diagnosis, however as noted above in Table 1 there are multiple case definitions in use . This is an ongoing challenge in terms of evaluating diagnostic tests because stud ies have used various case definitions as the reference standard against which they measure the utility of a diagnostic test. We evaluated w hether these case definitions identify similar or different groups of people ; our findings are discussed below . Studies Comparing Case Definitions for ME/CFS Eight studies evaluated the concordance of different diagnostic criteria ( Table G1 of Appendix G ).5,9,50-55 One study considered the comparison based on age variance and will be discussed under Key Q uestion 1b.53 These studies examined patients who met the clinical criteria for various case definitions and reported on differences in symptom prevalence between patient populations . These were primarily observational cohort studies a nd descriptive studies , therefore not amenable to quality rating . Differences reported here are those that were statistically significant between groups (see Table G 1 for a complete report) . Studies consistently demonstrate that symptom reporting varies be tween populations defined by different clinical criteria . In general, populations defined by ME or ME/CFS criteria were more symptomatic and impaired than those defined by CFS criteria. 5,9,50-56 15 Sore throat and lymph node pain were more common in 14 subjects who met the Holmes, 1988 CDC criteria compared with thos e meeting the Fukuda, 1994 CDC criteria (n=18) and with fatigued patients due to psychiatric i llness (n=33).50 This study also compared the 36- item Short Form Sur vey ( SF-36) measurements among these groups and found no consistent differences in terms of bodily pain, general health, physical health composite score, mental health composite score, and self -reported degree of impairment (see Table G 1 for details) . A si milar study compared symptom prevalence for CFS identified by CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria with ME/CFS identified by Canadian (Carruthers, 2003) criteria using data from three populations and comparing scores on the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire and the SF -36.5 The SF -36 scores indicated significantly less impairment for the CFS group compared with the M E/CFS group in all three populations on the subscales of physical functioning and bodily pain. Symptom reporting indicated less impairment in the CFS group compared with the ME/CFS group in the majority of PEM, pain, autonomic, and immune symptom subcatego ries. Responses to other symptom subcategories were less consistent across the populations : 4 of 13 neurocognitive symptoms were significantly lower in the CFS group compared with the ME/CFS group for all three populations , and the other seven neurocogniti ve symptoms were significantly lower in the CFS group compared with the ME/CFS group in just two of the populations (DePaul sample and BioBank) . Likewise, only one of six sleep symptoms was lower for CFS compared with ME/CFS in all three populations, where as three of six sleep symptoms were lower in two of the populations . This may reflect differences in the populations \u2014the DePaul and BioBank demonstrated more consistent differences in symptoms for CFS compared with ME/CFS, whereas the Newcastle sample (tho se referred by primary care for suspected CFS) did not demonstrate as many differences between those who were identified as having CFS by the CDC (Fukuda , 1994) criteria and those identified as having ME /CFS by the Canadian (Carruthers, 2003) criteria. 5 SF-36 and symptom scales were compared among 74 patients who had been labeled as CFS defined by CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria with 39 patients labeled as ME defined by the international consensus criteria (Carruthers , 2011) .51 In this study, SF -36 subscale scores indicated less impairment among the CFS group versus the ME group on the physical functioning, bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning subscales . Symptom ratings also indicated less impairment among the CFS group compared with the ME group for PEM, neurological, and pain symptoms. Using a similar population, another study compared the Canadian ( Carruthers , 2003) criteria with the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria and an ME definition created from multiple sources , based on the cardinal features of ME (acute onset plus PEM, neurological manifestations, and autonomic manifestations). 9 Of the 114 people who met the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria, 56 were also classified as ME/CFS and 27 as ME . There were significant differences among these groups in multiple symptoms; symptom reporting was lower for the group who met CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria (but not ME) versus those who met the ME/CFS Canadian (Carruthers, 2011) criteri a, and lower for those who met the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria (but not the ME/CFS criteria) versus those who met the ME criteria (defined in this study and based on prior definitions and cardinal features) . The ME/CFS group had higher psychiatric comorbidity rates compared with the CFS group. Objective measures of heart rate, cognitive function (trail making tests), and the Kroenke 13 symptom inventory were also compared across groups, demonstrating that ME and ME/CFS groups had higher heart rates lying down and 2 and 10 minutes after standing compared with the CFS -only group, longer times on the trail making tests, and higher 16 scores on the Kroenke symptom and psychiatry comorbidity scale . These findings were consistent with those of two other studies.54,55 Another study compared 41 patients meeting CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria with 26 patients meeting London ME (Dowsett, 1994) criteria using the SF -36, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory 20- item ( MFI-20), Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), and exercise testing . CFS patients had lower functioning than ME patient s on the role -emotional and mental health subscales of th e SF-36 (other subscales of the SF -36 were not significantly different between the two groups ). The g eneral fatigue score of the MFI -20 was significantly higher f or CFS versus ME but the other four components of the MFI -20 were not different . There were no meaningful differences in treadmill exercise test variables for ME subjects versus CFS ( 5 of the 7 variables were not significant ); age predicted hazard ratio ( HR) and oxygen consumption ( VO 2) were both higher for the ME group compared with the CFS group ( p=0.049) .52 In summary, most studies that compared patients meeting case definitions of ME or ME/CFS with patients meeting case definitions of CFS showed tha t patients diagnosed using an ME or ME/CFS case definition reported worse symptoms and had more impairment in physical and cognitive domains than patients being diagnosed using the CFS case definition . One study comparing patients diagnosed with the London ME (Dowsett, 1994) criteria with the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria found few differences between the two groups; but where there were differences, the CFS patients had worse symptoms than ME patients . Both studies comparing ME with CFS or ME/CFS are small . In the larger studies that compare ME/CFS with CFS there seems to be a consistent finding of more significant differences, favoring the theory that ME/CFS and CFS identify different populations . It may be that the CFS criteria capture a broader population ( such that ME and ME/CFS are subsets of CFS), or that ME and ME/CFS identify separate grou ps entirely . Studies Comparing Symptoms Among ME/CFS and Non-ME/CFS Populations Three studies compar ed symptoms of CFS patients diagnosed with the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria with other groups of patients: controls that were healthy and nonfatigued, controls that were fatigued but did not meet CFS criteria, and controls with fatigue and another chronic illness (Table G1 ).57-59 Although not technically measuring concordance between case definitions, these studies identified scales that distinguished patients meeting criteria for one of the case definitions versus those who di d not meet criteria for that case definition . These studies demonstrated significant differences in reported symptom s between patient groups . Differences were measured by the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), Chalder Fatigue Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depressio n Scale depression subscale (HADS -D), and certain SF -36 subscales or combinations of SF -36 variables with the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. T hese scales may help to identify CFS patients, but they will need to be evaluated in a broad spectrum of patie nts with diagnostic uncertainty to determine their ability to differentiate between conditions and/or identify clinical subgroups of patients 57-59 (see Appendix J for more details). Variables from the SF -36 and Zung Self -Rating Depression Scale were used to distinguish between 51 women with CFS, 55 with idiopathic chronic fatigue ( defined as chronic fatigue not meeting criteria for CFS ), and 53 nonfatigued controls matched to the CFS subjects .57 In this study, computer modeling using latent class analysis was able to empirically derive a solution that was comparable wit h the established case definition . Thus, the computer modeling validated 17 the ability of the CDC ( Fukuda , 1994) criteria to differentiate a group of CFS patient s from a group of non- CFS patients . Differences were found in symptom reporting in a study compar ing 19 consecutive patients presenting to an academic medical center 's chronic fatigue clinic who met CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria with 31 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).58 General Health Questionnaire scores were highest for the CFS group and lowest for the RA group; the SF -36 role function scores indicated lowest impairment in the RA group and highest in the CFS group; SF -36 mental function was best in the RA group and lowest in the CFS group; SF -36 health perception was highest in the RA group and lowest in the CFS group; no differences in the other SF -36 subscales or in the Modified Symptoms Perception Questionnaire or the Pennebaker Inventory of Limbic Languidness.58 Functional status and well -being were evaluated in 223 patients who met criteria for CFS using the CDC ( Holmes, 1988) criteria with both a populati on-based control sample and a group with various chronic diseases using the SF -36.59 CFS patients had lower functioning than the general population on all SF -36 subscales, and lower functioning than almost all disease groups on most subscales: the exceptions were that the CFS group did not differ from the group of 25 multiple sclerosis patients in terms of physical functioning, vitality, and role -emotional, nor did the CFS group differ from the congestive heart failure group on the role -emotional subscale . Based on these three studies, symptom reporting varies between CFS patients and other populations but the utility of these symptom -based scales in differentiating patients with diagnostic uncertainty remains inconclusive. Accuracy of Measures Used To Diagnose ME/CFS as D efined by A ny of the CFS Case Definitions Eleven cross -sectional and longitudinal studies with comparison groups evaluated methods currently us ed to diagnose ME/CFS . Two studies evaluated how well symptom scales could predict a subset of patients who fail to recover from cardiopulmonary exercise testi ng (CPE T) and will be discussed under Key Q uestion 1b.60,61 All of these studies provided data on discriminative value ( receiver operating curve [ROC], area under the curve [ AUC ]), sensitivity/specif icity, or concordance of diagnoses ( Table G 2).56,60-69 One study was good - quality,63 seven fair -quality,56,60,61,64-69 and one poor -quality62 (Table H1 of Appendix H ). The studies were conducted in the United States56,60,61,65 and western Europe,62-64,66-68 were generally small (range: 25 to 798 participants , with only two studies enrolling >200 participants) and predominately enrolled women (43 to 100% female when reported) . Several studies used the same or very similar study populations to report on di fferent outcomes, recruiting from CFS self - help groups,66-68 or a community sample outside Chicago.56,65 Overall the identified studies lacked robustness needed for rigorous evaluation of diagnostic tests for ME/CFS . Major limitations of these studies include : enrolling fe wer than 50 total subjects,60-62,66-68 recruitment from specialty clinics,60,61,63 lack of clear blinding to the reference standard result,56,60-68 and compar ing cases with either healthy or nonfatigued controls . The use of healthy controls and the case -control design are problematic for diagnostic test studies; ideally, a diagnostic test is able to differentiate patients with the disease from those without in a population of patients with diagnostic uncertainty . Thus, a robust evaluation of a diagnostic test requires a broad spectrum of patients and includes patients who would be reasonable candidates for the test \u2014in this case, patients presenting with fatigue and other symptoms that suggest a 18 diagnosis of ME/CFS . Only one study used a population with overlapping symptoms and tested a strategy for diagnosis in both a derivation and a validation cohort.63 Biomarkers as Diagnostic Tests Four studies evaluated the ability o f serum parameters to identify CFS (using the CDC [Fukuda, 1994] and Oxford [ Sharpe, 1991] criteria) versus healthy controls, and reported on the AUC for the ROC curve for these measures . The tests included hypothalamic -pituitary axis testing (cortisol res ponse to dexamethasone suppression test),67 insulin tolerance testing and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and salivary cortisol responses to insulin pro-inflammatory response to standardized psychological stress,68 and RNase L -isoforms.62 All of the biomarker studie s were small (sample size range: 25 to 42) . 62,66- 68 Three were fair -quality and utilized the same CFS self -help group population in Germany, and one was poor -quality . Three of the biomarker studies from the same group of investigators66-68 found that biochemical responses to stimuli were abnormal in the ME/CFS group compared with healthy controls . The morning plasma and sal ivary cortisol responses to low -dose overnight dexamethasone suppression testing were significantly lower in the ME/CFS group versus controls (F=12.16, p=0.003 for morning cortisol and p=0.001 for salivary free cortisol); this finding was consiste nt when comparing the logAUC (total) between groups. 67 The AUC of ACTH response to insulin tolerance testing was significantly associated with reported duration of symptoms (F=4.92, p=0.03) , but there were no differences between ME/CFS patients and controls for plasma total and salivary free cortisol (F=0.73, p=0.4; F=2.12, p=0.15).66 Response to stress was tested using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a standardized psychological stress test, and found an inverted pro- inflammatory cytokine response for ME/CFS subjects compared with controls; ME/CFS subjects ' levels of IL -6 and TNF - decreased at 10 minutes and returned to normal by 60 minutes, whereas the IL -6 and TNF - levels for controls increased at 10 minutes and returned to normal at 60 minutes (IL -6 F=3.93, p=0.03; TNF - F=4.64, p=0.02). 68 ACTH response varied between the groups, but cortisol did not (AUC for ACTH studies recruited from a CFS self -help group population in Germany and utilized essentially the same patients for all three studies . Although the C FS diagnosis was confirmed subsequ ently by physician examination or interview, the recruitment process of these studies has potential to provide a limited spectrum of patients with CFS . In addition, because they utilize the same population, these three stu dies are not independent of each other.66-68 The fourth of these biochemical studies evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of RNase L levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells for discrimination of ME/CFS subjects from controls . The ratio of RNase L isoforms at a cutoff of 0.4 had a sensitivity of 0.91 and specificity of 0.71; other thresholds result ed in lower sensitivity and specificity. 62 Although these tests were able to distinguish between healthy controls, the ir usefulness remains uncertain without testing in a broader spectrum of patients including those with over lapping features. Self-Reported Symptom Scales as Diagnostic Tests Three studies created new assessment tools.63,64,69 One good- quality study evaluated an appropriately broad spectrum of subjects , including 41 with systemic lupus erythematosis, 58 with fibromyalgia, and 99 with CFS as defined by Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria ; subjects were randomly assigned to either a derivation or validation cohort.63 A new tool was developed by administering prospectively defined criteria via questionnaire; each symptom was assessed for 19 sensitivity and specificity and the symptoms with the best sensitivity and specificity were elected to contribute to the new criteria . Four methods for classification of ME/CFS were tested u sing the derivation cohort, and for each algorithm sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were determined using the validation cohort . One of the four strategies that included 24 symptoms, the artificial neural network, had the best results (sensitivity 0.95; specificity 0.85 and accuracy 0.90). 63 One other large (n=368 CFS patients diagnosed by a combination of methods including physician interview about the conf idence of their diagnosis and 430 controls) fair -quality study tested the Schedule of Fatigue and Anergi a for CFS scale in ME/CFS patients and healthy controls using latent class analysis ; this study demonstrated good sensitivity (0.81) and specificity (0.98).64 A third fair -quality large (n=691) study used K -means clustering to identify the most predictive symptoms from the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (D SQ), define thresholds for symptoms, and then calculate sensitivity, specificity , and accuracy for each symptom comparing three definitions of CFS: CDC -CFS (Fukuda, 1991), Canadian, ME/CFS (Carruthers, 2003), and International -ME (Carruthers, 2011). The st udy authors conclude d that the DSQ can provide an accurate basis for diagnosing CFS as compared with these three case definitions and that some high yield symptoms may enhance the predictive capacity of CFS, specifically symptoms that reflect fatigue, gene ral pain, PEM , sleep dysfunction, and neurocognitive issues. 69 These findings have not been replicated in other populations . Three small, fair -quality studies that reported on cortisol testing also reported the AUC values for the MFI -20, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ), the Symptom Checklist 90, Revised (SCL -90-R), and the Sickness Impact Profile 8 -item (SIP -8), using essentially the same patient population; these studies found that all measures were significantly different between CFS cases ( CDC (Fukuda, 1994) and Oxford (Sharpe, 1991)) and healthy controls (no medications, no current/lifetime psychiatric symptoms or disorders).66-68 While AUCs were different, these studies do not further the diagnostic strategy for ME/CFS because of their methodological limitations: small sample size , case- control design, unclear recruitment methods, and unclear reporting of attrition and blinding ( Table H1). These results show that patients with ME/CFS have more depression, anxiety, and decreased functionality in several other domains; but because the comparison population consisted of healthy controls there is no evidence that these tests could adequately distinguish a ME/CFS population from another populati on of depressed, anxious, or medically ill patients . Overall, it is unclear whether these measures could diagnose ME/CFS if used by themselves (in the absence of the clinical criteria), because alone these measures do not satisfy the multiple symptom domains that currently comprise the syndrome of ME/CFS. Two studies evaluated the ability of existing symptom scales to identify ME/CFS patients or to correlate with specific aspects of the diagnostic criteria such as disability or fatigue, in hopes of providing a more standard assessment tool for use in diagnosing ME/CFS . A fair -quality small study ( 24 ME/CFS patients and 84 healthy controls ) evaluated the SF -36, the CDC Symptom Inventory, and the MFI -20 for identifying ME/CFS subjects who met the disability cr iterion for the CDC ( Reeves , 2005) criteria. 49 The MFI -20 had reasonable sensitivity (0.95) for the criteria but poor specificity ( 0.27); none of the AUCs for the MFI -20 were above 0.90.56 In this study, the CDC Symptoms Inventory had poor sensitivity and specificity, as did the SF -36 subscales of physical functioning, role physical, social functioning, and role -emotional (none with AUC, sensitivity, or specificity above 0.90).56 In a subsequent paper, also fair -quality, the SF -36 was further evaluated using two different ME/CFS populations: 32 CFS patients recruited from the community and 114 CFS patients 20 recruited from tertiary care defined by CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria , as well as 47 nonfatigued controls . Similar to the previo us findings, none of the AUCs for the community -based CFS patients were above 0.90, whereas three AUCs for subscales of the SF -36 in the tertiary care CFS population were close to or above 0.90 (vitality, role -physical, and general health all had AUC of 0.91; social functioning had AUC of 0.87) . Additional analysis focused on vitality, role -physical, and social functioning to determine cutoffs and assess whether the use of combinations of scales could identify ME/CFS subjects in both the community and the t ertiary care samples as distinguished from healthy controls . The study authors determined that meeting the cutoffs for two or more of these three subscales could be used to designate substantial reductions in function and to potentially distinguish those w ith ME/CFS from those without ME/CFS . For the community -based ME/CFS sample, sensitivity was 0.93 and specificity was 0.75; for the tertiary care sample, sensitivity was 0.96 and specificity was 0.75. 65 These researchers also used the MFI-20, the CDC Symptom Inventory, and the SF -36 to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the CDC -CFS (Reeves , 2005) criteria for identifying CFS in the community population compa red with healthy controls; the AUC for Reeves criteria was 0.70 (sensitivity 0.65; specificity 0.76).65 These studies do not appear to contribute to operationaliz ing the ME/CFS criteria given the inconsistencies in the results . The subscales of the SF -36 show promisi ng results in a tertiary care, recruited population (the SF -36 scores for vitality, role -physical, and general health were above 0.90);56 however, this was not true for the community -recruited ME/CFS patients . Key Question 1b. How does the use of these methods vary by patient subgroups? Key Points One study rep orted that older patients were more impaired, but it did not consider how symptom evaluation might vary with age. Two studies found that CPET s were different between ME/CFS patients and healthy controls, and that certain subscales of the SF -36 were associ ated with slow recovery after exercise. No studies evaluated differences in the performance of case definitions among patients with specific symptom sets (autonomic/neuroendocrine, neurological/neurocognitive , or presumed infectious etiologies). Detailed Synthesis Three studies evaluated potential diagnostic tests in subgroups of ME/CFS patients .53,60,61 Using a unique approach, one study evaluated whether symptoms vary for younger versus older CFS patients . They studied 50 CFS pati ents, diagnosed using the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria, matching 25 older subjects (>50 years) by sex and duration of CFS diagnosis with 25 subjects aged 16 to 29 years. 53 Older CFS patients were more impaired, having higher FIS scores, higher Chalder Fatigue scores, higher HADS -D scores, lower functioning by SF -36, and lower self - efficacy . The two groups did not differ on the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, HADS total, HADS anxiety subscale (HADS Grading Scale. Several autonomic and hemodynamic measures differed between older and younger CFS patients : older patients had lower resting heart rates , higher left ventricular ejection time, lower baroreflex sensitivity (ability to main tain blood pressure) than younger patients , but 21 there were no differences in systolic, diastolic , or mean blood pressure, total heart rate variability during a supine 10 min ute rest, baroreflex effective index, and systolic blood pressure with active stand . Diagnostic tests to predict recovery from exercise testing were evaluated in two fair -quality studies of the same population.60,61 The first of these studies demonstrated that CPET capacity was significantly different between CFS patients defined by CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria and nondisabled sedentary controls . SF-36 and MFI -20 were then tested to dete rmine whether these two scales could distinguish those who would fail to recover from testing within 1 day . The AUC analysis demonstrated that SF -36 subscales of physical function, role -physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, and social functionin g were significant for failure to recover at 1 day; and the subscales role -emotional, vitality, and bodily pain were significant for failure to recover at 1 week.60 A separate study evaluated whether individual symptoms could identify CFS patie nts defined by CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria versus controls and found that the symptoms of fatigue, neuroendocrine dysfunction, immune dysfunction, pain, and sleep disturbance all had significant AUC, whereas muscle stiffness, autonomic, and \"other \" symptoms were not significant.61 These studies are limited by small size and ca se-control design and preclude any valid conclusion about the utility of SF -36 or MFI -20 for prediction of failure to recover at 1 day or 1 week. Key Question 1c. What harms are associated with diagnosing ME/CFS? Key Points Fourteen studies evaluated cons equences of the diagnostic process or diagnosis of ME/CFS . Five studies found that patients with ME/CFS feel stigmatized by their diagnosis in terms of financial stability, work opportunities, perceived judgments on their character, social isolation, and i nteractions with the health care system . Prejudice and stereotypes within the medical profession were identified in two studies; medical trainees and mental health practitioners make judgments about a patient' s condition based on the name it carries (ME, CFS, or other) and what treatment is being given. One study described patients ' fear, anxiety, confusion, self -doubt , and bitterness when they lacked a dia gnosis for their problems , as well as their feeling s of both social and medical legitimacy upon obtaining a diagnosis . Six studies describe a substantial burden of misdiagnosis among the CFS population. Detailed Synthesis Consequences of the diagnostic process or the diagnosis of ME/CFS were evaluated in 14 studies that used primarily descriptive methods not amenable to quality rating ( Table G3 ).14,21,70- 81 Studies used a variety of methods to assess patients ' experiences and understanding of their disease including qualitative interviews, surveys , and an internet discussion group. Verification of registry referral criteria , review of speci alty clinic referral rejections by chart review , and interviews of providers were used to assess misdiagnosis and pr ovider perceptions of diagnosis . One study performed thorough psychiatric evaluation to identify the frequency of missed psychiatric disease in CFS. 73 Two studies randomized participants to various disease names but 22 with identical case descriptions in order to test the effect of the disease name on perceptions by medical trainees and undergraduate students.14,70 The five studies that used either survey or interview methods to assess harms found that ME/CFS patients experience social stigma as a result of their disease. These include decrease in financial stability (lower standard of living in 92 of 207 patients , new job that required fewer skills or pay cut in 30 to 35 of 207 patients ), decrease in social life (174 of 207 patients) and loss of friends , (79 of 207 patients) feeling estranged (42 of 45 patients) , decrease in recreational activities (186 of 207 patients), feeling like they needed to conceal their symptoms (17 of 44 patients) , delegitimization (10 of 14 patients) and difficult interactions with the medical profession (stereotypes perpetuated and doctors having decided before meeting them that they had a psychological diagnosis), and feeling like th eir moral character was questioned.71,72,74-76 A separ ate study described patients ' fear, anxiety, confusion, self -doubt , and bitterness when they lacked a dia gnosis for their problems, as well as their feeling s of both social and medical legitimacy upon obtaining a diagnosis .81 In this study, 45 of 50 people interviewed reported that diagnosis was the single most helpful event in the course of their illness. Two publications describe a study of undergraduate students (n=105) and medical trainees (n=141) who were randomized to being told that the diagnosis for a patient case presentation (identical among all groups) was either CFS, ME, or Florence Nightingale Disease.14,70 Medical trainees ' perceptions of diagnostic accuracy, physiological etiology, and prognosis varied between groups; CFS label was considered most accurat e, while the ME label carried worse prognosis . Mental health practitioners were randomized to being told that an identical CFS patient was getting one of three treatments . The assigned treatment appeared to influence subsequent attributions of the patient 's disease. Specifically, practitioners who were told that the patient was getting an intravenous immune modulator as the treatment were more likely to think that the patient was correctly diagnosed as having CFS and was more disabled (p<0.05 for both). 70 Attempting to understand the possible benefits conferred by a diagnosis, one group surveyed 20 general practitioners and 50 patients with CFS . Providers reported f eeling reluctant to diagnosis CFS because of uncertainty about the impact of a diagnosis on the patient , complexity of offering care, and concern that the diagnosis m ight become a self -fulfilling prophecy . Meanwhile, patients described fear, anxiety, confu sion, self -doubt , and bitterness when they lacked a diagnosis for their problems , followed by a feeling of both social and medical legitimacy upon obtaining a diagnosis . While it did not diminish the severity of symptoms, getting a diagnosis seemed to posi tively influence the way the patients managed their symptoms.81 Missed diagnoses, whether exclusionary or concomitant (such as psychiatric), are common among p atients being evaluated for ME/CFS . A prospective evaluation of the frequency of misdiagnosis in patients with CFS studied 68 patients who met the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria . Patients participated in a standardized structured interviews with a consulta nt psychiatrist, a nd a full medical, psychiatric, family, and personal history was obtained . Of 68 patients evaluated, 31 (46%) reported having been given a psychiatric diagnosis (2 out of 3 of them had been incorrectly diagnosed). 73 Specifically, 21 patients had been given a psychiatric diagnosis when one did not exist, and 13 patients who had never been given a psychiatric diagnosis actually had a treatable psych iatric condition in addition to CFS. 73 Likewise, a case series of 135 patients who w ere enrolled in the PACE tria l using the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria, reported that 76 patients (56%) had psychiatric co- morbidity.79 Indeed, 23 the prevalence of alternate diagnoses in people for whom a diagnosis of CFS is being cons idered has been well -described . Among those with a preliminary diagnosis of CFS, ove r half had at least one exclusionary diagnosis.21,77 Among patients referred to the Newcastle CFS Clinical Service and meeting CDC ( Fukuda , 1994) criteria, three clinical phenotypes emerged: 3 percent had positional orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), 3 percent had a CFS/fibromy algia overlap phenotype, and 20 percent had symptoms precipitated by a viral/bacterial infection . In this study, those who were referred but did not meet the CDC ( Fukuda , 1994) criteria had the following alternative diagnoses: chronic disease (47%), sleep disorders (20%), , and disorders (1%).80 Of 418 referrals to a specialty CFS clinic in London, 52 (26%) had a likely alternative psychiatric diagnos is and 67 (35%) had a likely alternative medical diagnosis.78 Key Question 2. What are the (a) benefits and (b) harms of therapeutic interventions for patients with ME/CFS , and how do they vary by patient subgroups? Key Points Thirty -five trials provided evidence of benefits and harms of treatment; all were small, most had methods rated as poor - or fair -quality, and comparisons across trials were limited by dissimilar outcome measures. Medications Nine trials met inclusion criteria for medical treatment of ME/CFS, although none of the medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for this indication. Two fair -quality trials of rintatolimod, an immune modulator not curr ently approved for use in the United States , enroll ed severely debilitated participants and found improvement in measures of exercise performance (low strength evidence) . Improvement in other measures of function and reduction of use in other medications for relief of CFS symptoms was also found in one of the studies , but evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions . A small fair -quality trial of valganciclovir enrolled patients with suspected viral onset of ME/CFS and elevated antibody titers and reported improved fatigue compared with placebo based on one scale, no differences for other outcome measures , this study will need to be replicated to provide adequate proof of efficacy . Small s ingle trials of i soprinosine, hydrocortisone, immunoglobulin G , and fluoxetine did not show significant improvement compared with placebo . Differences were also not found in a larger dose -ranging trial of galantamine . These studies provided insufficient evidence of treatment effects. Additional trials with dura tions less than 12 weeks indicated no differences with placebo for acyclovir, and improved scores for physical health and function with rituximab, although both studies enrolled 30 or fewer participants and the clinical implications of these results are no t clear. Harms of medications included suppression of adrenal glucocorticoid responsiveness, increased appetite , weight gain, and difficulty sleeping with hydrocortisone; flu- like 24 syndrome, chills, vasodilatation, dyspnea, and dry skin with rintatolimod; headaches with immunoglobulin G ; and nephrotoxicity with acyclovir . Withdrawals due to harms were greater with fluoxetine than placebo . Complementary and Alternative Medicine Seven trials compared one CAM approach with usual care, placebo, or alternative CAM intervention. Interventions included dietary supplements (insulin- like growth factor, antioxidant, acetyl -carnitine), distant healing, homeopathy, melatonin, and phototherapy . All outcomes studied have insufficient evidence due to small single studies with methodological limitations. Trials of CAM interventions found no clinically or statistically significant improvements compared with placebo, usual care, or an alternative CAM approach. Three small fair -quality trials of CAM interventions (one with homeopathy, one with pollen extracts, and one with L -carnitine preparations) found improvement from baseline in some measure of fatigue and/or function or well -being but not others. One good- quality study found that being aware that one is not receiving dist ant healing resulted in smaller improvements in function. Adherence was low in one trial of a low sugar/low yeast diet but otherwise adherence and harms were not well reported. Counseling and Behavior Therapies Fourteen trials (23 publications) comparing one counseling or behavioral therapy with usual care, wait list control, no treatment, relaxation techniques only, adaptive pacing, anaerobic therapy, graded exercise t reatment (GET ), or an alternate form of counseling or behavioral therapy were included . When considering all studies comparing any type of counseling with no treatment, support, relaxation, or adaptive pacing there is low strength of evidence that counseling decreases fatigue (7 of 11 trials showed positive effect), low strength of evidence fo r improvement in measures of functioning (4 of 11 trials showed positive effect; 2 of 11 showed mixed results on different measures), low strength of evidence for improvement in quality of life (2 of 4 trials showed positive effect), and moderate strength of evidence for global improvement (2 of 2 trials showed positive effect) . Low strength of evidence suggests that at followup, patients receiving counseling had better SF -36 physical functioning subscale scores than control patients, based on a pooled analysis of eight trials; weighted mean difference score of 7.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.58 to 11.87) . However, when results were limited to the four studies that used CBT specific techniques the results were similar but no longer statistically significant. There is low strength of evidence from a small fair -quality trial that face -to-face counseling is similar to telephone counseling in improving function, employment measures, and global change. Harms of counseling and behavioral therapies were poorl y reported but there is low strength of evidence that counseling is not associated with harms , based on one moderate - sized and one large -sized trial. 25 Exercise Therapy Six trials (7 publications) provided evidence on the effectiveness and harms of exercise therapies . GET improved measures of fatigue (low strength of evidence ), function (moderate strength of evidence ), and clinical global impression of change (moderate strength of evidence ); treatment effectiveness may not be generalizable to all patients an d may overestimate the benefit as no study used a case definition selecting for more disabled patients . Although single small studies found qigong exercise provided improvement in measures of fatigue and that home orthostatic training was similar to usual care or sham orthostatic training , this evidence was insufficient due to small sample sizes and methodological limitations of the studies . Harms were not well reported . Although total withdrawal rates were similar to controls in three of four trials, due t o the high rate (20%) of patients refusing repeat exercise testing in one study, lack of subgroup analysis throughout, and no studies select ing for a more disabled population (ME case definition), evidence remains insufficient to determine harms of exercis e therapies and whether subsets of patients may experience more or fewer harms . Combination Therapy and Head-to -Head Comparisons Four trials (8 publications) were included that compared either head -to-head interventions or combinations of two interventions . GET and cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) had similar improvement on measures of function (low strength of evidence ). Fatigue measures are also likely similar ; however , results are mixed (insufficient evidence ). Evidence on the comparison of GET and fl uoxetine is insufficient because there was only one small study with methodological flaws . This study found GET improved measures of fatigue and function , whereas fluoxetine did not . CBT appears to be associated with fewer harms than GET . Detailed Synthesis Thirty -five trials of interventions for patients with ME/CFS in 45 publications met inclusion criteria ; 9 trials of medications, 7 of CAM interventions, 14 of counseling and behavior therapies, 6 of exercise therapies , and 4 of either head -to-head comp arisons or combinations of these interventions (Table G 4). Seven were rated good- quality, while 23 were r ated fair- and 5 poor-quality (Table H2). Trials enrolled from 16 to 641 patients with ME/CFS and most (25 of 35, 71% ) used the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria. Outcome measures included the SF-36 physical functioning subscale, Medical Outcome Study Short Form (MOS -SF), Checklist of Individual Strength (CIS) , Profile of Mood States (POMS) fatigue subscale, KPS , SIP-8 scale to measure overall function; MFI-20, C halder Fatigue Scale, Krupp Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), FIS, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to measure fatigue; Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI), Quality of Life Index (QLI), Quality of Life Scale (QLS), EuroQol Scale, Global Wellness Scale, Shor t Form 12-item Health Survey (SF-12), and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) to measure quality of life; Clinical Global Impression Change (CGI) scales to measure improvement over 26 time; and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale to measure impairment in work . These are described in Appendix J . Medications Nine randomized trials provided evidence for the medical treatment of ME/CFS , including placebo -controlled trials of and fluoxetine90 (Table 3 below; Table G 4). None of these medications have been approved by the FDA f or this indication. Two medications are still investigational and not currently FDA approved for any indication, intravenous rintatolimod87,88 and oral i soprinosine.89 Additional trials not meeting inclusion criteria because th ey had durations less than 12 weeks indicated no differences with placebo for acyclovir,91 and improved SF -36 scores for physical health and function with rituxi mab.92 Both studies enrolled 30 or fewer participants and the clinical implications of these results are not clear. Eight trials met criteria for fair-quality ,82-88,90 and one for poor (Table H2).89 Major limitations of studies include enrolling fewer than 20 subjects in an arm,85,86,89 high loss to followup,82,90 lack of intention -to-treat analysis of outcomes,84,87 lack of reporting between -group comparisons for key outcomes,88 unclear randomization process,89 and lack of blinding.89 Most trials were either funded by pharmaceutical companies (fully or in part)82,85-88 or the funding source was not reported.83,84 Most trials were designed to treat the potential underlying pathology of ME/ CFS. All but two trials89,90 enrolled participants in the United States . Only three enrolled more than 100 participants ,82,88,90 and three were multi- center.82,87,88 Participants were predominantly women, and their mean ages ranged from 32 to 50 years . Although most participants were white, many trials did not report race or ethnicity . Most trials used the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria in their inclusion criteria except for one study predating it that used the CDC (Holmes , 1988) criteria ,85 and one trial that used the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria.90 The duration of illnes s varied widely with some trials enrolling participants with durations under 3 years83,84,89,90 while others were 10 years or more.86,88 Outcome measures of fatigue differed between trials, precluding direct comparisons . These included the CGI scale, Chalder Fatigue Scale, POMS (fatigue and vigor subscales only ), VAS (degree of fatigue; abbreviated fatigue questionnaire), FSS , fatigue scale specific to the trial, hours of rest per day, Symptom Severity Scale (fatigue, prolonged post -exertion fatigue), CPET tolerance, exercise duration and work, MFI -20, and CDC CFS Symptom Inventory . Additional measures of function and quality of life were also used as outcomes . Strength of evidence ratings indicated low strength of evidence for intravenous rintatolimod in improving exercise performance in patients with ME/CFS , because r esults were ba sed on two trials with differing outcome measures . All other trials found no differences or inconsistent results compared with placebo and were limited by small sizes and methodological limitations , leading to insufficient evidence ratings . Three trials compared immune modul ating drugs with placebo, including trials of intravenous rintatolimod87,88 and oral isoprinosine, both not currently FDA approved for any indication in the United States .89 In an early trial of rintatolimod, 92 severely debili tated patients (KPS scores of 20 to 60) were randomized to rintatolimod 200 mg twice weekly for 4 weeks , then 400 mg twice weekly for a total of 24 weeks , or placebo.87 The median percentage changes from baseline to week 24 were significantly different between groups for e xercise duration (10.3 for rintatolimod 27 vs. 2.1 for placebo; p=0.007), exercise work (11.8 for rintatolimod vs . 5.8 for placebo; p=0.011), activities of daily living (23.1 for rintatolimod vs . 14.1 for placebo; p=0.034), and vs. 0 for placebo; p=0.023) . Attrition was 9 percent and adherence 91 percent , and harms did not differ between groups . This trial was limited by lack of intention- to-treat analysis . A second trial randomized 240 participants (KPS scores of 40 to 60) to rintatolimod 400 mg twice weekly for 40 weeks or placebo.88 The mean percentage change in CPET tolerance from baseline to week 40, the primary outcome, was greater for the treatment versus placebo group (37% vs. 15%; p=0.047) . Although other performance scores were measured, they were not compared between groups (KPS, activities of daily living, SF-36 vitality and general health perception subscales) . More participants in the treatment group reported decreased use of medicatio ns for relief of CFS symptoms ( 68% vs. 55%; p=0.048) . Attrition was percent adherence 83 percent . Flu-like syndrome , chills, vasodilatation, and dyspnea were more frequent in the treatment group (p<0.05) . A single -blinded trial of isoprinosine randomized 10 patients to treatment and 6 to placebo .89 The treatment group received 3 g/day of isoprinosine in divided doses for 12 weeks that varied over time . Mean changes in KPS scores from baseline did not differ between groups (p=0.93). A randomized double -blind placebo controlled trial of valganciclovir, an antiviral agent, enrolled 30 participants with suspected viral onset of ME/CFS and elevated antibody titers.86 The treatment group received oral valganciclovir 900 mg twice daily for 21 days, then 900 mg once daily for a total of 6 months . Participants were followed for another 6 months, and outcomes were measured at 9 months . Differences were statistically significant from placebo for scores on the FSS ( -0.06 for valganciclovir vs. 0.02 for placebo; p=0.006), but not the MFI -20, CDC CFS Symptom Inventory, or s elf-reported physical function. Attrition was 9 percent and adherence 91 percent . No harms were reported for either group. To evaluate the efficacy of galantamine, an acetyl -cholinesterase inhibitor, participants from 35 clinical centers in the United Kingdom, western Europe, and the United States were randomized to oral galantamine at various doses (7.5, 15, 22.5, or 30 mg/day) or placebo for 16 weeks (8 weeks at full dose).82 Outcome measures indicated no statistically significant differences or dose effect between groups for the primary outcome of global improvement (CGI scale), or secondary outcomes of fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Scale) and quality of life (FIQ). The overall withdrawal rate was 23 percent and attrition rate 30 percent , but rates were highest among groups given galantamine doses of 15 mg or more per day. Overall, 90 percent reported harms , with depression, nausea, and headache most common in both groups . Two percent of the galantamine participants experienced serious events, but none was attributed to the study drug. Two trials evaluated corticosteroids versus placebo, including a trial randomizing 70 participants to oral hydrocortisone (20 to 30 mg every am and 5 mg every pm) or placebo for 12 weeks,83 and a cross over trial of 100 participants using hydrocortisone (5 mg/d ay) plus 9-alpha fludrocortisone (50 \u00b5g/day) for 12 weeks.84 Neither study reported statistically significant differences in outcomes between treatment and placebo groups for fatigue (POMS ; VAS ), quality of life (Global Wellness scale; VAS ), or function (activity scale; SF-36). Attrition rates were 10 percent83 and 20 percent .84 Harms that significantly differed between treatment and placebo groups included suppression of adrenal glucocorticoid responsiveness (12 vs. 0; p<0.001); increased appetite (17 vs. 8; p=0.02); weight gain (19 vs. 8; p=0.006); and difficulty sleeping (17 vs. 8; p=0.02) immunoglobulin G (1 gm/kg) versus placebo (1% albumen solution) given once every 30 days for 6 months was evaluated in a trial of 30 participants.85 While measures of 28 fatigue, prolonged post -exertion fatigue (Symptom Severity Scale), and physical function ( MOS - SF) were not statistically significantly different between groups, social function ( MOS -SF) improved for the placebo group (p<0.05) . Overall, attrition was 7 percent, and 20 percent experienced harms including 93 percent of treatment and 60 percent of placebo participants reporting headaches (p=0.03). Fluoxetine was compared with placebo in a 6- month, 4- arm fair -quality trial that also included a GET group which will be describ ed separately bel ow.90 Differences between fluoxetine and placebo were not statistically or clinically significant for fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Scale), function al capacity measured as the amount of oxygen consumed in the final minute of exercise per kg of body weight, or rates of nonfatigue (Cha lder Fatigue score of <4) Attrition was higher with fluoxetine than placebo (32% vs. 17%) and adherence was not reported. Withdrawals due to medication side effects were greater with fluoxetine (9 of 68, 13%) than placebo (2 of 68, 3%) although there were no differences in total withdrawals. Two trials not meeting inclusion criteria because the treatment was less than 12 we eks in duration were examined for completeness. A crossover trial of intravenous acyclovir enrolled 27 adults with CFS who met serologic criteria for Epstein -Barr virus.91 All patients were treated with acyclovir or placebo for 37 days, then they crossed over to the alternate treatment. Fatigue, vigor, and wellness scores, as well as other outcomes, did not differ between groups, although three patients developed acyclovir -induced nephrotoxicity. The second trial randomized 30 patients with CFS to intraveno us rituximab, a monoclonal antibody, or placebo given as an infusion at two different times spaced 2 weeks apart.92 More participants in the rituximab compared with placebo group had improved SF -36 physical health and function scores and unadjusted fatigue scores, although adjusted differences were not statistically significant. In summary, there is low strength evidence that rintatolimod improves measures of exercise performance (improved CPET tolerance 36.5% vs. 15.2%, p=0.047; exercise work 11.8% vs. 5.8%, p=0.01) ; and insufficient evidence for other medications because few differences were found between treatment and placebo groups and each was evaluated by only one small trial with important methodological limitations ( Appendix K ). 29 Table 3.

Two trials met criteria for good- quality methods ,95,97 four fair-quality ,93,96,98,99 and one poor -quality94 (Table H2). Trials evaluated different dietary approaches or supplements , distant healing, homeopathy, melatonin, and phototherapy . Most were conducted in Europe and all but one97 of the trials had small sample sizes (n<100) . Five of the trials enrolled patients based on the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria and two of the trials used the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria . Major limitations of studies include d inadequate or unclear randomization,94,99 enrolling fewer than 20 subjects in an arm,93,94,99 high loss to followup,93 lack of intention -to-treat analysis of outcomes,93,98,99 unclear or inadequate blinding,93,96,99 and dissimilar groups at baseline.95 Trials were either funded by foundations or trusts,97-99 pharmaceutical companies (fully or in part),95,96 or the funding source was not reported .93,94 The evidence on CAM therapies was insufficient to draw conclusions because they were tested in single trials only , and trials had small sample size s and important methodological limitations . No trials of CAM therapies found statistically or clinically significant improvements compared with placebo, usual care, or an alternative CAM a pproach. Adherence was low in one trial of a low sugar/low yeast diet but otherwise adherence and harms were not well reported. A good -quality trial (n=57) compared Acclydine\u00a9, a combination of amino acids and a food supplement derived from the plant Solanum dulcamara proposed to increase biologically active insulin -like growth factor (IGF -1), with an identical placebo.95 Patients were identified based on the CDC (Fukuda , 1994) criteria and followed over 14 weeks for measures of fatigue and function. N o differences were detected for fatigue severity based on the CIS fatigue severity subscale questionnaire (1.1; 95% CI, -4.4 to 6.5) or self assessed daily fatigue level (-0.2; 95% CI, -1.2 to 0.9). There were no difference s in function based on the SIP-8 (59.1; 95% CI, -201.7 to 319.8), and physical an actometer motion -sensing device (4.1; 95% CI, -5.9 to 14.0).95 Of note, the re was also no difference in IGF-1 blood levels between groups . Attrition was low and no harms were reported. A fair -quality study (n=89) compared acetyl -L-carnitine (2 g/day) with (2 g/day) and with a combination of both.96 Patients were eligible based on CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria. Outcomes compared CGI and MFI -20 comparing scores 8 weeks prior to intervention with those obtained after 24 weeks of treatment. Attrition was 20 percent attrition (18 of 90 enrolled) and adherence was not reported. Although some scores improved from baseline (CGI for acetyl -l-carnitine, 59%, propionyl -L-carnitine, 63%), between group differences were not reported. For the secondary outcomes of fatigue, propionyl -L-carnitine and the combination therapy showed a reduction on the 20- point general fatigue axis (from 18.4 SD 1.8 to 16.5 SD 3.1, and from 19.1 SD 1.4 to 17.3 SD 3.3, respectively), whereas acetyl -L-carnitine showed a reduction on the 20- point menta l fatigue axis (from 16.3 SD 2.5 to 13.9 SD 3.5). No differences were found on the physical fatigue axis. Patients reported sleeplessness and feeling overstimulated although withdrawal due to harms were similar between groups. Although improvement was found on several measures compared to baseline measurements, the evidence leaves no indication whether one formulation was truly superior to another. A poor -quality crossover trial randomized 22 patients to an extract of pollen (antioxidant) or placebo for 3 months followed by a 2- week washout and then to the pollen extract or placebo for an additional 3 months. Outcome measures included total well -being, fatigue, and fatigability on 32 a non-standard 10-point Likert scale (0 =no problem and 10=serious symptoms).94 No differences were detected. Adherence was not reported and no serious harms were noted. A fai r-quality trial (n=86), randomized patients diagnosed with CFS based on the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria to homeopathy or placebo.98 Homeopathic prescriptions included different single or multiple r emedies pr escribed a t monthly consultations over a 6- month period. Patients randomized to homeopathy had improved scores on the general fatigue subscale of the MFI-20 (mean change 2.70, SD 3.93 vs. 1.35, SD 2.66, p=0.04), but no differences on other dimensions or on the Fatigue Impact Scale or in the proportion of patients with significant clinical improvement (change from baseline of 15% on MFI- 20 subscales). A s econdary c un clear ( physical di mension subscale of the Functional Limitations Profile (FLP) with a mean change of 5.11 (SD 8.82) compared with 2.72 (SD 8.40) in the placebo arm). Attrition was similar between groups (overall 11 of 103, 11%) and n either adherence nor harms were reported. Although some improvement was noted in some measures, t he lack of spe cificity i n the treatment received and the inconsistencies i n results l eave uncertainty r egarding an y potential be nefit. A s mall (n=39) fair -quality trial compared a low sugar/low yeast diet with healthy eating in a group of primarily female patients (88%) diagnosed with ME/CFS using the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria. 93 The low sugar/low yeast diet involved omission of all sugar containing foods, refined carb ohydrates, yeast containing foods, alcohol, and caffeine with a limited consumption of fruit and milk except a daily yogurt. Those randomized to the healthy eating approach were advised to consume a high fiber diet with five servings of fruit and vegetables per day, two servings of fish per week, and reduced fat and refined carbohydrates. Patients were followed for 24 weeks for outcomes of fatigue and quality of life. Results indicated no differences in either outcome based on the Chalder Fatigue Scale and the SF -36 but did note high loss to followup (25%, which were not included in analysis) and low adherence (24% in the low sugar/low yeast group vs. 67% in the healthy eating group). A good-quality trial (n=409) randomized patients to immediate versus deferred distant healing (waiting) and used the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) or Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria to determine inclusion. 97 The median duration of illness ranged from 9.6 to 11.9 years. The intervention included healers from 21 European countries who had a m ean healing experience of 9.7 years (SD 7.9 years). Healers were replaced if they did not comply with the study design (34 of 462, 7%). The Physical Health Component Summary score of the SF- 36 was the secondary outcome of the study and indicated no differences between groups (1.11; 95% CI, -0.255 to 2.473). Although there was no interaction effect for treatment and blinding (p=0.32), patients who knew they were not being treated had lower scores at followup (mean difference between groups: -1.544; 95% CI, -2.913 study compared melatonin and phototherapy with placebo.99 Thirty patients identified using the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria were given placebo initially for 12 weeks followed by melatonin (5 mg every evening) or phototherapy (2500 Lux for 1 hour in the morning). This was followed by a 12- week washout (phototherapy group) or placebo (melatonin group) and then a crossover to the reverse schedule. 99 The study reported no differences on a 10- point VAS of fatigue, the Mental Fatigue Inventory, or the SF-36 physical functioning dimension. In summary, t here is i nsufficient evidence to de termine the effectiveness or harms of CAM interventions because only small single studies with methodological limitations are currently available. 33 Table 4.

One trial compared face- to-face cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) with telepho ne CBT and did not include a control group.101 All trials were designed to target symptoms of ME/CFS, not treat the underlying cause . Five trials were rated go od- quality ,113,114,116,118,121 six fair-quality ,100-102,108,109,112 and three poor -quality104,107,110 (Table H2 ). Most of the trials (64% ) were of small sample size (n<100) , predominately enrolled females (54 to 100%), with mean ages ranging from 31 to 58 years, and the duration of illness ranged from 6 months to 52 years . Half of the trials used the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria to identify people with ME/CFS, while others used the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria, one developed by Schluederberg in 1992, and one study instead used a combination of a CFS questionnaire, psychiatric assessment, and medical assessment to rule out other conditions and diagnose ME/CFS. 108 Five used cognitive and CFS specific techniques,100,108,112,113,121 one used CBT techniques focused on activity,102 one used traditional CBT techniques aimed at a CFS population delivered either over the phone or face -to-face,101 and one used relaxation, didactic discussion, and cognitive techniques for CFS.110 Three of the interventions were conducted in group formats100,110,112 instead of individual. Three good- quality ,114,116,118 one fair -quality ,109 and two poor-quality104,107 trials evaluated other counseling techni ques, which included guided self - instruction programs, group illness management instruction, pragmatic rehabilitation, peer -to- peer counseling, and symptom consultation. The largest trial was the PACE trial, a 12 month good- quality 4- arm trial that include d a comparison of CBT (n=155) with adaptive pacing (n=159), and usual care (n=157) . This trial measured outcomes of fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Scale), function (SF -36 physical function subscale), clinical global impression of change, and work impairment (wor k and social adjustment scale).121 The GET arm is discussed in the Exercise Therapies and Head -to- Head/Comparison Trials Sections . Patients were selected from mu ltiple specialty care centers in the United Kingdom and were eligible based on the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria for CFS as well as a Chalder fatigue score of 6 or greater (of possible 11) and SF -36 score of 60 or less (of possible 100) , which was subsequently changed to 65 or less to increase enrollment. CBT was based on the fear avoidance theory of ME/CFS that regards symptoms as being \" reversible and that cognitive responses (fear of engaging in activity) and behavioral responses (avoidance of activity) are linked and interact with physiological processes to perpetuate fatigue.\"121 CBT consisted of up to 14 individual sessions over 23 weeks, with a booster session at 36 weeks . The aim was to \" change the behavioral and cognitive factors assumed to be responsible for perpetuation of the participant 's symptoms and disability .\"121 Strategies guided participants to address unhelpful cognitions, including fears about symptoms or activity , by testing them in 36 behavioral experiments consisting of gradual increases in both physical and mental activity . Adaptive pacing consisted of a maximum of 15 sessions of therapy aimed at achieving optimum adaptation to the illness through activity pacing and advice to avoid activities that demand more than 70 percent of particip ant's perceived energy ; therapy was delivered by occupational therapists . Usual care was provided by physicians specializing in ME/CFS . In other studies, CBT and adaptive pacing had similar aims and strategies . Pragmatic rehabilitation was also based on a physiological dysregulation theory of ME/CFS with patients and the rapists collaboratively setting goals for activity, sleep, and cognitive function.118 Counseling and supportive listening were empathic and nondirective in nat ure. Adherence was not reported in eight of the trials,100,102,104,107,109,110,116,121 one trial only reported that the adherence was \"good,\"114 while another trial stated that all completed CBT.113 One trial reported that 28 percent of participants did not receive their intended treatment.101 One trial reported that the participants completed an average of 10 out of 13 counseling se ssions, but no other information,108 and two trials reported contamination, not specifically adherence (6% in the CBT group received support, while 8% in the support group received CBT112 and 3% in the counseling group received support, while 1% in the support group received pragmatic rehabilitation and 10% in the support group did not receive any treatment).118 Attrition was reported in most trials and was generally low (<20%) and similar between groups . Three trials reported high or differential attrition ; two trials were in group settings, but reported opposite information, with higher attrition in group CBT compared with control (14% vs. 20%)110 in one trial and higher attrition in the usual care group compared with group CBT (14% vs. 25%) in the other trial. 112 The third trial reported higher attrition in the telephone CBT group compared with the face- to-face CBT group, but both were high (56% vs. 34%).101 One trial conducted a stepped care approach, providing participants with a self -instruction program to follow for 16 weeks or delayed care followed by CBT ; this s tudy found that after 16 weeks, 57 percent of those in the self-instruction group and 22 percent in the delayed group did not want to continue on to CBT, and therefore dropped out of the study.115 Major limitations of these trials include d enrolling fewer than 20 subjects in an arm,107 high loss to followup,101 unclear if use of intention- to-treat analysis,104,107,108,110 unclear randomization or allocation process,100,104,107,108,110,114 more men allocated to the intervention group,112 and lack of or unclear information ab out blinding of the outcome assessor.100,101,104,108,109,113,114,116 Due to the nature of the interventions, most trials could not blind patients or care providers . Trials were either funded by government or organizational grants (fully or in part)100,104,107,108,110,112-114,116,118,121 or the funding source was not reported.101,109 There is lo w strength evidence, based on 14 trials, that CBT, either group or individual; self - instruction booklets; pragmatic rehabilitation; peer -to-peer counseling; and symptom consultation provide improvement in fatigue, function, quality of life, and employment in adult patients with ME/CFS . When comparing any type of counseling or behavioral therapy to no treatment, support, relaxation, or adaptive pacing there is low strength of evidence that counseling decreases fatigue (7 of 11 trials showed positive effect) and improves functioning measures (4 of 11 trials showed positive effect; 2 of 11 showed mixed results on measures), quality of life (2 of 4 trials showed positive effect), and global improvement (2 of 2 trials showed positive effect). Harms of counseling and behavi oral therapies were poorly repo rted, but there is low strength of evidence that CBT is not associated with harms based on one moderate -sized trial. 37 Function O utcomes Eleven trials (n=1,720 ) of counseling techniques compared with no treatment, support, relaxation, or adaptive pacing, reported overall functioning measured by the SF -36 physical functioning subscale, KPS, SIP -8, and the functional impairment scale.100,102,104,107- 109,112,113,115,118,121 Results were mainly positive, but mixed . In four trials102,108,113,121 counseling improved overall functioning compared with controls on various measures, while two trials reported mixed results using different measures in the same study,109,112 one trial reported improvement in the control group compared with counseling,100 and the other four trials reported no differences between groups.104,107,115,118 Eight trials used the SF -36 physical functioning subscale to measure overall functioning102,107-109,112,115,118,121 and results were mixed . Four trials102,108,109,121 reported significantly more improvement in the CBT group compared with controls (71% vs. 49% improved by 8 points from baseline at 1 year, p=0.0068 121 and 63% vs. 17% with a score >83 at 6 months followup, p<0.001102) or better scores (mean scores of 58.64 vs. 39.72 at 1 year, p<0.01108 and mean scores of 65.9 vs. 60.2 at about 6- 12 months, p=0.011109). However, by 5 years in one trial the results were no longer significantly different,103 and in another trial on the SIP-8 the outcome was reversed with worse functioning reported in the self -instruction group compared with the wait list control (mean scores of 1,515 vs. 1,319, p<0.001).109 The other four trials reported no differences between the counseling group and controls.107,112,115,118 However, one trial also measured functio ning using a walking speed test and found improved walking speed in the CBT group compared with controls (difference from baseline to 12 months for CBT vs. support: 1.77; 95% CI, 0.025 to 3.51; p=0.0055 and difference from baseline to 12 months for CBT vs. no intervention: 2.83; 95% CI, 1.12 to 5.53; p=0.0055). 112 Another trial conducted a post hoc analysis on those with baseline functional disability (defined as SF -36 physical functioning baseline score 70) and reported a significant improvement in the self -instruction group compared with the wait list control (mean change from baseline CBT vs. control: 9.05; 95% CI, 0.2 to 17.9; p<0.05).115 When trials using the SF -36 physical functioning subscale were pooled there was a significant effect for the intervention group to have better scores compared with control s at follo wup; weighted mean difference of 7.73 (95% CI, 3.58 to 11.87, Figure 3 ). Even when one outlier that showed a more significant difference than the other trials102,103 was removed the difference was still significant with a weighted mean difference of 7.18 (95% CI, 4.53 to 9.83) . However, when the analysis was limited to the four trials that used formal CFS specif ic CBT techniques, though the result was similar, the difference was no longer significant owing to the wide CI (weighted mean difference of 9.12, 95% CI, - 3.10 to 21.35, p=0.14, I2=69%).102,108,112,121 One trial used the KPS to measure overall functioning113 and reported significantly more improvement in the CBT group compared with controls (73% vs. 23% improved by 10 point at 12 months; difference of 50% CBT vs. no intervention; 95% CI, 28 to 72%) . One trial only used the SIP -8 to measure overall functioning100 and reported worse functional impairment in the CBT group compared with the wait list control (mean change from baseline at 6 months: 29 vs. - 293; p=0.004) . Along with the other outcomes reported above , the SIP -8 showed mixed results . One trial o nly used the functional impairment scale to measure overall functioning and found no differences between counseling and the wait list control at 6 months followup.104 The PACE trial performed a sensitivity analysis for those patients who fulfilled the CDC (Reeves, 2003) criteria for CFS (n=321) and for those patients who fulfilled the London 38 (Dowsett, 1994) criteria for ME (n=245) at baseline and found similar results for the outcomes of function; however, primary data w ere not provided.121-123 Fatigue Outcomes Eleven trials (n=1,691 ) of counseling compared with no tre atment, support, relaxation, or adaptive pacing, reported decreased fatigue measured by the Chalder Fatigue Scale, FSS, CIS, POMS -fatigue, Profile of fatigue -related symptoms scale, and the SF -36 vitality subscale. 100,102,104,107-110,112,115,118,121 Results were primari ly positive, but mixed. In seven trials counseling significantly decreased fatigue compared with controls on various measures, 102,104,107,109,112,115,116,121 while the other four trials showed no differences between groups.100,108,110,118 Four trials used the Chalder Fatigue Scale to measure fatigue102,112,118,121 and results were primarily positive . Three trials reported significantly more decreases in fatigue in the counseling group compared with the controls (63% vs. 15% were non -cases of fatigue with a score <4 at 6 months; p=0.001102) or better scores (difference in scores from baseline at 1 year for CBT vs. support: - 3.16; 95% CI, no intervention: - 2.61; 95% C I, - 4.92 to - 0.30; p=0.027112 and at 52 weeks for CBT vs. no - 3.4; 95% CI, -5.0 to - 1.8; p=0.0001121). However, by 5 years in one trial the results were no longer significantly different.103 The other trial that u sed the Chalder Fatigue Scale reported statistically significantly better fatigues scores in the pragmatic rehabilitation group than the usual care group (treatment effect estimate of - 1.18; 95% CI, -2.18 to - 0.18; p=0.021), but by 70 weeks there were no differences. 118 Due to the variability in how the Chalder F atigue S cale was used across studies, these results could not be pooled. Three trials used the CIS to measure fatigue100,109,115 and results were primar ily positive . Two trials reported significantly less fatigue in the counseling groups compared with the controls (27% vs. 7% improved at about 6 to 12 months; OR 4.9; 95% CI, 1.9 to 12.9; 95% CI, 1.69 to 14.57;116 both used a reliable change score of >1.64 and final score of 36 to indicated improved) . Only one non randomized trial found no differences between groups at 6 months.100 Two trials used the FSS to measure fatigue107,108 and both found significantly lower fatigue scores in the counseling groups compared with the controls (mean scores of 52.9 vs. 59.4 at 4 months; p=0.04107 and mean scores of 5.37 vs. 5.62 at 1 year, but p value not reported108). One trial conducted post hoc analyses and compared fatigue and functioning outcomes based on homework compliance.105 Homework included assignments such as of readings, sleep diaries, and activity diaries, and at home practices such as activity goals, relaxation exercises, and use of coping skills. They identified three groups based on the amount of homework completed; minimum compliance completed 0 to 25 percent, moderate compliance completed 25.1 to 75 percent, and maximum compliance completed 75.1 to 100 percent of their assigned homework. When they assigned individuals to groups they noted that the highest percentage in the maximum group (56%) were in the cognitive therapy group, the highest percentage in the moderate group (34%) were in the CBT group, and the highest percentage in the minimum group (38%) were in the anaerobic and relaxation gro ups. At 12 months, though there was a trend toward decreased fatigue and better improvement in functioning scores for the maximum compliance group compared with the other groups , this trend did not reach significance. One trial used only the Profile of fat igue-related symptoms scale to measure fatigue 104 and reported better scores in the counseling group compared with the wait list control (mean scores 39 of 2.68 vs. 3.84 at 6 months; p=00.04), while one trial reported no differences in fatigue scores using the POMS.110 The PACE trial performed a sensitivity analysis for those patients who fulfilled the CDC (Reeves, 2003) criteria for CFS (n=321) and for those patients who fulfilled the London (Dowsett, 1994) criteria for ME (n=245) at baseline and found similar results for the outcome of decreased fatigue , but primary dat a were not provided. 121-123 Quality of Life Outcomes Four trials (n=372) of counseling compared with no treatment, support, or relaxation, reported quality of l ife measured by the QOLI, QLI, QLS, EuroQol, and the health utilities index.108,110,112,114 Results were mixed, but primarily positive . Two trials reported better scores in the counseling group compared with controls (mean QOLI scores at 12 weeks: 2.81 vs. 3.26; p=0.02110 and mean change in QLI scores from baseline at 12 months: 2.6 vs. 0.6; p<0.05114), one trial108 reported slightly better scores on the QLI in the cognitive group compared with CBT and controls at 1 year, but the p value was not reported (69.10 for CBT vs. 72.52 for cognitive vs. 63.00 for anaerobic activity vs. 72.00 for relaxation), and the fourth study reported no differences between groups.112 Employment Outcomes Four trials (n=869) of counseling compared with no treatment, support, relaxation, or adaptive pacing reported employment outcomes including proportion working full - or part -time, hours worked per wee k, and level of work impairment measured by the Work and Social Adjustment Scale.100,102,103,108,121 Results were primarily positive . Both trials measuring work impairment with the Work and Social Adjus tment Scale reported significantly better scores for the CBT group compared with controls (mean scores of 3.3 vs. 5.4 at 6 months; p<0.001 on scale scored with range 0 to 8;102 mean scores of 21.0 vs. 24.5 at 1 year; p=0.0001 on scale scored with range 0 to 45121). Two trials reported the number of hours per week individ uals were working . One trial reported significantly more hours worked per week, of those working, for the CBT group compared with relaxation (mean hours of 35.57 vs. 24.00 at 5 years; p<0.04)103 and the other trial reported no differences between groups.100 Two trials reported no differences in the proportion of individuals working full - or part -time at 1 year108 or 5 years.103 Global Imp ression of Improvement Outcomes Two trials (n=690) of counseling compared with no treatment, relaxation, or adaptive pacing reported global improvement using the CGI, spontaneous reporting of fully recovered or feeling much better, relapses, fu ll recovery, and no longer meeting ME/CFS criteria. 102,103,121 Significantly more individuals in the CBT group reported improvement compared with controls in both trials (70% vs. 31%; p<0.01 102 and 41% vs. 31%; p=0.013121). One trial103 also followed up 5 years after counseling and continued to report more improvement in the CBT group compared with relaxation (68% vs. 43% with symptoms \" steadily improved\" not \" consistently absent ' or \"mild\"; p=0.05; 4% relapses of 2.58 vs. 4.08; p<0.01) ; however , there was no difference in the number of individuals currently meeting the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria for ME/CFS (52% vs. 39%; p=0.42) . 40 Recovery Outcomes The PACE trial consi dered the outcome of recovery (trial recovery was defined as: within the normal range in fatigue [Chalder Fatigue Scale score <18] and physical function scales [SF-36 physical function subscale score 60], no longer meeting Oxford [Sharpe, 1991] criteria, and reporting much or very much improvement on the CGI scale; clinical recovery was defined as: meet ing all criteria for trial recovery plus no longer meet ing the London [Sharpe, 1991] or the CDC [Ree ves, 2003] criteria) .121 Although trial recovery remained low for all treatment arms (<25%), they found CBT to be superior to adaptive pacing therapy (OR 3.36; 95% CI, 1.64 to 6.88) and usual care ( OR 3.69; 95% CI, 1.77 to 7.69), with similar results for clinical recovery . Although the PACE trial has performed measures to minimize risk of bias and is one of the best available in the ME/CFS literature given its siz e and methodology, there are limitations . Although blinding patients and providers to the intervention was not feasible, and statisticians were blinded, the study may be open to risk of observer bias by not blinding researchers assessing outcomes . They did, however use self-reported outcome measures to reduce the risk of observer bias, which are valid tools for measuring the outcomes of interest . The study may also be at risk of attention bias given the total number of visits by participants were greater in the CBT ( 17) and adaptive pacing (16) groups compared with the usual care group (5) . The nature of the approach to CBT, using providers and training manuals that teach patients that the treatment is effective, can cause an expectation bias in the directio n of improvement . Additionally, there are reservations about the interpretation of the recovery results . Given that a score of 65 or less on the SF -36 physical functioning scale was defined as disability for entry in to the trial, using a score of 60 or gre ater on the same scale to define recovery is contradictory . The authors reportedly derived their threshold for recovery based on the mean score for a normal adult minus two SDs (84 to 16). Furthermore, they defined deterioration as greater than a 20 point reduction in the SF -36, yet they defined improvement as an increase of 8 point or more. T hese threshold values likely favor results in the direction of improvement . For fatigue outcomes they considered recov ery as a Chalder Fatigue Scale score less than 18 yet other studies have considered a score of less than 4 to indicate a return to normal. 118 Finally, although statistically significant changes were noted, th e meaningfulness of th ese change remains uncertain . For instance, the mean score of the SF -36 ph ysical function score remained at or above 60 (used in the definition of trial recovery) for all groups, while the 6- minute walk test was much less than for nor mal older adults (379 meters vs. 631 meters).124 Face-to-Face Versus Telephone CBT One fair -quality trial (n=80) compared face -to-face CBT with telephone CBT, without using a control group,101 followed them for 12 months, and measured fatigue using the Chalder Fatigue Scale, functioning using the SF -36 physical functioning subscale, work impairment using the Work and Social Adjustment scale, and overall improvement using a self -rated global improvement Likert style scale, similar to the CGI sc ale (ranging from very much worse to very much better) . There were no significant differences between groups on any of the outcomes at any time point. Both groups showed significant improvement at 12 months after the end of treatment from baseline on the S F-36 physical functioning subscale and the Work and Social Adjustment scale, and the majority of participants rated themselves as much better or very much better on the self -rated global improvement scale (56%). 41 Harm s Outcomes Only three good- quality trials reported anything about harms after counseling or behavior therapies . The PACE trial specifically defined adverse events as \" any clinical change, disease or disorder experienced by the participant during their participati on in the trial, whether or not considered related to the use of treatment \" and serious adverse events as \" an event that resulted in one of the following outcomes: a) death, b) threat to life (i.e., an immediate, not hypothetical, risk of death at the time of the event), c) required hospi talization except for elective treatment of a pre- existing condition, d) increased severity and persistent disability, defined as: (i) sever e, i.e. significant deterioration in the participant' s ability to carry out their important activities of daily living ( e.g. employed person no longer able to work, caregiver no longer able to give care, ambulant participant becoming bed bound); and (ii) symptom and disability persistent, i.e. of at least 4 weeks continuous duration, e) any other important medical condi tion which, though not included in the above, might require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed, and f) any episode of deliberate self -harm .\" 122 All serious adverse events were further analyzed after breaking blinding to determine whether the event was related to the intervention, which were deemed serious adverse reactions . Nonserious adverse events were reported often , howeve r the CBT group reported significantly less (848) than both the adaptive pacing group (949, p=0.0081) and usual care group (977, p=0.0016).121 Although serious a dverse events were uncommon, there were more reported in the adaptive pacing group (16) than the CBT group (8) or the usual care group (7) , and there were more serious adverse reactions in the CBT group (4) compared with the adaptive pacing (2) or the usua l care group (2) . No one withdrew from CBT due to worsening . There was a significant difference in deterioration of phys ical function across treatment arms ( adaptive pacing 25% vs. usual care 18% vs. CBT 9 %, p<0.001), but no differences in serious deterior ation defined by a composite score of reduced function, worsening clinical global impression, withdrawal rates, and serious advers e reactions.121,122 One small trial (n=47) reported none withdrew due to harms114 and a moderate- sized trial (n=257) reported no differ ences between groups for reported harms or withdrawals due to harms,118 but no other information was provide about harms. Summary of Counseling and Behavior Th erapy Trials In summary , there is moderate strength of evidence that counseling techniques was associated with global improvement (41 to 70% vs. 25 to 31%), and low strength of evidence that counseling techniques improved overall functioning (SF-36 physica l function weighted mean difference 7.73; 95% CI, 3.58 to 11.87), fatigue (27 to 76% vs. 7 to 65%), and employment outcomes in ME/CFS patients . The effects may not be generalizable to a more disabled population as no study used a case definition for ME and only one study analyzed patients fulfilling the London ME (Dowsett, 1994) case definition and may have been underpowered to detect a difference. 121 Whether thes e effects can be sustained is uncertain as benefit was no longer seen in one trial that evaluated patients 5 years later. In addition, trials used various measures to detect change making it difficult to compare results and few trials reported the clinical significance, if available, of the improvement in scores . Recovery has rarely been tested and measurements used to determine effectiveness may be overestimating the effect and not reflective of true recovery . Harms were rarely reported Only one large tria l (n=630), the PACE trial, reported significantly less harms in the CBT group . 42 Figure 3 .

Major limitations of studies include dissimilarity of groups,125,127 high loss to followup,128 lack of intention -to-treat analysis of outcomes,128 and unclear or inadequate blinding.90,121,125-127 One trial was funded by a ME/ CFS network and all other trials were funded by research agencies or trust s. GET was superior to control groups in measures of fatigue , clinical imp ression of change , and function. Th ese findings however cannot be generalized to all patients with ME/CFS as no study enrolled patients whereby PEM was a diagnostic requirement (ME case definitions) and only one study performed a subgroup analysis to deter mine if similar results were found in patients meeting the diagnosis of ME . Recovery was only evaluated in one study and the clinical significance/meaningfulness of the results is questionable as several of the thresholds used to gauge recovery were lower than a normal population. The harms of exercise may be underestimated as it has been inadequately evaluated and reported particularly in patients with specific symptom subsets (i.e., PEM, autonomic dysfunction) . Qigong exercise may be beneficial based on o ne small trial and home orthostatic training was ineffective based on one small trial but the evidence is insufficient without replication . Graded Exercise Therapy The effectiveness of GET compared with control groups (usual care, placebo, placebo exercis e, adaptive pacing) was studied in four trials .90,121,125,127 The largest of these was the PACE trial, a 12 month good- quality 4- arm trial that included a comparison of GET (n=159) with adaptive pacing (n=159) and usual care (n=157) , and measured out comes of fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Scale) , function (SF -36 physical function subscale) , clinical global impression of change, and work impairment (Work and Social Adjustment S cale) .121 The CBT arm is discussed in the Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies and Head- to-Head /Combination Therapies Sections . Patients were selected from multiple specialty care centers in the United Kingdom and were eligible based on meeting the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria as well as having a Chalder Fatigue Scale score of 6 or greater (of possible 11 ) and SF -36 score of 60 or less (of possible 100) which was subsequently changed to 65 or less to increase enrollment. GET consisted of a maxi mum of 15 sessions including education and a negotiated exercise plan with incremental activity increases aimed at 30 minutes of light exercise 5 times a week , delivered by physical therapists or exercise physiologists . Adaptive pacing consisted of a maxim um of 15 sessions of therapy aimed at achieving optimum adaptation to the illness through activity pacing and advice to avoid activities that demand more than 70 percent of patient 's perceived energy, and was delivered by occupational therapists . Usual car e was provided by physicians specializing in ME/CFS . Compared with the usual care group and the adaptive pacing therapy group, at 1 year the GET groups reported statistically significantly better fatigue scores (mean difference GET vs. usual care: -3.2; 95% CI, -4.8 CI, -4.2 to -0.9; p=0.0059), difference GET vs. usual care: 9.4; 95% CI, 52 4.4 to 14.4; p=0.0005; adaptive 12.8; 95% CI, 7.7 to 17.9; p<0.0001), and work impairment scores (mean score: 20.5 GET vs. 23.9 usual care, p<0.001; GET vs. 24.5 adaptive pacing therapy , p<0.001) . GET groups reported great er improvement on the self-rated CGI at 1 year compared with both the usual care and adaptive pacing therapy groups (OR of positive change vs. negative change for GET vs. usual care : 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.5; p=0.013; GET vs. 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.3; p=0.028) . Improvement was also reported in the 6 -minute walk test distance across all groups at 52 weeks but a significantly greater improvement in the GET group (+ 35.3 m, p< 0.001 vs. usual care; +41.0 vs. adaptive pacing ). Symptoms of PEM were lower in the exercise group compared with both usual care (OR 0.5, p=0.003) and adaptive pa cing (OR 0.5, p=0.004) . The authors performed a sensitivity analysis for those patients who fulfilled the CDC (Reeves, 2003) criteria (n= 321) and for those patients who fulfilled the London ME (Dowsett, 1994) criteria (n=245) and found similar results for the outcomes of fatigue and function. The investigators also considered the outcome of recovery , described above in the Counseling and Behavioral Therapies Section. 123 Although trial recovery remained low for all treatment arms (<25%), t hey found GET to be superior to adaptive pacing (OR 3.38; 95% CI, 1.65 to 6.93) and usual care (OR 3.71; 95% CI , 1.78 to 7.74) , with similar results for clinical recovery .123 Nonserious adverse events ( whether or not related to treatment ) were reported often and were similar between groups (usual care : 977; adaptive pacing therapy: 949; GET: 992) . Although serious adverse events were uncommon, there were more reported in the GET group (17) than the usual care group (7), p=0.04. Although there was a significant difference in deterioration of phys ical function across treatment arms ( adaptive pacing 25% vs. usual care 18% vs. GET 11% , p<0.001), t here were no differences in serious deterioration defined by a composite score of reduced function, worsening clinical global impression, withdrawal rates, and serious adverse reactions due to the treat ment. 121,122 There were no differences in harms attributable to the treatment received . As discussed above, the PACE trial may be exposed to risk of observer bias by not blinding the research assessors , and attention bias given the total number of visits by participants were greater in the GET (16) and adaptive pacing (16) groups compared to the usual care gr oup (5) . Additionally, patients are educated that they will improve with GET which can add an expectation bias in the direction of improvement . A smaller fair -quality trial conducted in New Zealand and of shorter duration found similar results on outcomes of fatigue and CGI , but did not find improvement in the physical function subscale of the SF -36. This was a 12 -week trial with 6 -month follow up comparing GET with standard medical care ( n=49) and enrolled patients meeting the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria .127 Exercise consisted of treadmill walking starting at 10 to 15 minutes , 4 to 5 times per week at a heart rate of 40 percent of VO 2 max (50% maximal heart rate) and increased by 3 to 5 minutes per week for the first 6 weeks and then by an increase in heart rate by 5 beats per minute per week with a goal of achievi ng 30 minutes of exercise at 70 percent VO 2 max imum (80% maximal heart rate) at 12 weeks.127 The primary outcome was the CGI , which was significantly improved in the GET group compared with the standard medical care group at 12 weeks (55% rated as much or very much better compared with 24% of the control , p=0.04) . Sixty -eight percent of patients rated their exercise therapy as 'effective' or 'highly effective.' Compared with standard therapy, GET showed improvement in all of the secondary fatigue outcome s at 12 weeks (Chalder Fatigue Scale scores; total score: -10.54 vs. - fatigue subscale: -3.90 vs. 0.60, p= 0.03), but showed no difference in the SF-36 physical functioning subscale ( 15.95 vs. 9.35, p= 0.49) . In their intention - 53 to-treat analysis with a 12 percent dropout rate (3 per group), neither the Chalder Fatigue Scale mental fatigue subscale n or SF-36 physical functioning subscale were significant.127 Notably, the GET group was younger (mean age 37 vs. 45 years) and had a shorter duration of illness (2.7 vs. 5.0 years) . They received 77 percent of the questionnaires at the 6 month fol lowup and found sustained improvement on the CGI and the Chalder Fatigue Scale physical fatigue whereas the Chalder Fatigue Scale mental fatigue subscale scores showed no difference between groups at 6 months.127 They also considered physiological assessment of fitness with incremental testing on a treadmill to determine maximum aerobic capacity (VO 2 peak) and found no difference between groups, however, comp lete data w ere only available for just over half (65%) the sample as many patients refused to have a second test due to perceived harm from the initial testing (10 of 49, 20%) , or stopped prior to maximal effort (5 of 49, 10%) , while the equipment failed on two patients . An earlier fair -quality 12 -week trial conducted in the United Kingdom found similar results for CGI , measures of fatigue, and function measured by the SF -36 when comparing GET with flexibility exercises.125 Sixty -six patients fulfilling the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria and without concurrent psychiatric or insomnia disorders attended weekly sessions in which they were prescribed a home program consisting of either exercise (primarily walking) or stretching and relaxation to be performed 5 days per week . The initial exercise prescription consisted of 5 to 15 minutes of aerobic exercise at an intensity of 40 percent of peak oxygen consumption (50 % maximum heart rate) to be increased by 1 or 2 minutes to a maximum of 30 minutes . Once achieved, the intensity was then increased to a maximum of 60 percent of peak oxygen consumption, as monitored by heart rate. If fatigue increased, patients were advis ed to maintain the same level of exercise until fatigue lessened . The flexibility and relaxation group started at 10 minutes of stretching/relaxation and were advised to increase to a maximum of 30 minutes while avoiding any extra physical activities . A greater number of patients in the GET group reported \"much \" or \"very much \" improvement on the CGI (16 of 29, 55% vs. 8 of 30, 27%; p=0.05).125 Intention- to-treat analysis including seven patients who dropped out (4 exercise, 3 flexibility/relaxation) found similar results (17 of 33 vs. 9 of 33, p=0.04) . They also evaluated changes in fatigue using various measures and found significant improvement on all measures with the exception of the mental fatigue subscale of the Chalder Fatigue Scale based on differences in means (Chalder Fatigue Scale total score: -8.40 vs. - 3,10, p< 0.01; VAS total fatigue score [ norma l=200] : -59 vs. - 39, p= 0.04; VAS score [normal=100] : -31 vs. p< 0.01; VAS mental fatigue score [ normal= 100]: not significant) . Improvement was also noted in function based on SF-36 total scores (137 vs. 84, p= 0.05) and physical function score (47.5 vs. 8.0, p= 0.01) . Although they reported a significant difference in the SF-36 general health score between groups at 12 weeks, there was a difference between the groups at baseline with the change being similar (4.0 vs. 4.0) . Differences were also noted in peak oxygen consumption, mean heart rate during submaximal treadmill testing, and mean submaximal perceived exertion score favoring the exercise group (13% vs. 6%; 143 beats per minute, SD 13 vs. 150 beats per minute, SD 13; 14.5, SD 3.4 vs. 16.2, SD 2.8, respectively) . Twenty -three of thirty patients in the flexibility/relaxation group were allowed to crossover to the exercise intervention at 12 weeks . One dropped out due to an unrelated condition and of the 22 who completed the program, 54 percent (12 of 22) rated themselves as better . At 1 year they found persistent improvement in measures of function with 66 percent (31 of 47) of those working or studying at least part time compared with only 39 percent (26 of 66) at baseline (95% CI, 9% to 44%) . 54 A final fair -quality 4 -arm study (n=136) enrol led 136 patients fulfilling the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria and compared fluoxetine with GET , placebo, or a combination of GET and fluoxetine , followed them for 6 months, and measured fatigue using the Chalder Fatigue Scale (14-item) and functional capacity measuring the amount of oxygen consumed in the final minute of exercise per kg of body weight.90 Attrition was highest in the combination group (42%), but was also high in the individual intervention groups (32% in fluoxetine group and 29% in GET group), while the control group had lower attrition (17%). Adherence was not reported in considering only the r esults of the GET (n=34) versus placebo (n=34) arms , after 6 months of treatment there was greater improvement in fatigue ( -5.7 vs. - 2.7) and more non- cases of fatigue (Cha lder score <4) in the exercise interventions (18% vs. 6% ). The exercise interventions showed an improvement in functional capacity, with a mean change from baseline at 6 months of 2.8 ml O 2/kg per minute (95% CI, 0.8 to 4.8). The exercise arm had a greater number of withdrawals compared with placebo (11 of 34, 32% vs. 5 of 34, 15%). Pooling of three of these trials found a significant improvement in CGI (RR 1.58; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.98, Figure 4 ), and SF -36 physical function subscale (weighted mean difference 10.29; 95% CI, 6.71 to 13.88, Figure 5 ).121,125,127 Due to the variability in how the Chalder Fatigue S cale was used across studies, these results could not be pooled. Qigong Exercise Qigong exercise was compared with no q igong exercise in a 4- month randomized trial in China . Patients 18 to 55 years and meeting the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria were recruited through online or newspaper advertising in Hong Kong (n=137) .129 Those randomized to the exercise group received group qigong twice weekly for 5 weeks (2 hours of education, relaxation, stretching , and 1 hour of qigong training per sessio n) followed by 12 weeks of home based qigong (30 minutes per day) . The control group was asked to refrain from qigong exercise. Attrition was 19 percent and similar between groups . Improvement was reported in the Chalder Fatigue Scale total score (mean change: -13.1 vs. - 6.6, p<0.001), physical fatigue subscale score (mean change: -8.8 vs. - 3.8, p<0.001), and mental fatigue subscale score (mean change: -4.4 vs. - 2.8, p=0.01) in both groups with a significan tly greater improvement in the qigong exercise group.129 No change was noted in the SF-36 physical function subscale score (3.2 vs. 2.1, p=0.48) in a smaller subgroup that were also being tested for telomerase act ivity (n=64) .126 Home Orthostatic Training Home orthostatic training (40 minutes of standing against a wall with their heels 15 cm from the wall) was compared with a sham home exercise program (10 minutes of wall standing while performing intermittent calf contractions) in a fair -quality 6-month trial of 38 patients fulfilling the CDC (Fukuda , 1994) criteria .128 No differences in fatigue as measured by the fatigue impact score in those who completed the trial and submitted a final questionnaire (n=25) . At 6 months, the sham group had a significantly greater drop in blood pressure when standing compared with the intervention group ( -6 mmHg; 95% CI, 0.0 to 12.6, p=0.05), but the clinical significance of this was not reported. Of note, they did not perform any subgroup analysis to determine if differences existed in those with subjective autonomic symptoms at baseline. Summary of Exercise Therapies In summary, compared with control groups, there is moderate strength of evidence that GET improved function ( weighted mean difference on SF-36 physical function ( 10.29; 95% CI, 6.71 55 , and change scores (RR 1.54; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.89), and low strength of evidence that GET improved fatigue in ME/CFS patients fulfilling the Oxford ( Sharpe , 1991) and/or CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria . However , subgroup analysis was inadequate to determine whether these benefits extend to patients with more disability meeting the criteria for ME. Although qigong exercise was found to improve some measures of fatigue, and orthostatic training did not change measures of fatigue, the studies w ere small and with methodological limitations which leaves uncertainty in the results . Harms were not well reported and although total withdrawal rates were similar in three of four trials, the high rate (20%) of patients refusing repeat exercise testing i n one study , limitations in subgroup analysis throughout , and lack of studies using a more disabled population suggest that this outcome has not been adequately studied. 56 Figure 4.

The fourth trial compared a combination treatment of CBT plus GET with usual care.111 The results for the head -to-head - trials that pertain to the comparison of one intervention to another, not a control group, on outcomes will be discussed in t his section; results based on comparisons with control groups, such as GET or CBT were discussed in those previous sections . All trials were designed to target symptoms of ME/CFS, not treat the underlying cause . One trial was good -quality121, while the other three were rated fair -quality90,101,108,111 (Table H 2). Three of the trials were of larger size (n>100) and illness duration, when reported, was at least greater than 6 months . Two trials used the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria to identify patients with CFS,90,121 one used the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) criteria,111 while the other used a combination of a CFS symptom questionnaire, psychiatric assessment, and medical assessment.108 Adherence was reported in only one trial , which found that participants completed an average of 10 out of 13 sessions .108 Attrition w as reported in three trials and was relatively high (>20%) in one .108 The trial of fluoxetine and GET reported the highest attrition in the combination group (42%), followed by the fluoxetine only group (32%), and the GET only group (29%) in comparison with the lowest in the placebo group (17%).90 The other two tr ials re ported low attrition rates (0.6 to 5%).111,121 There is low strength of evidence that GET and CBT or cognitive therapy had similar results on measures of fatigue and function in one good -quality and two fair -quality head -to-head trials . GET was superior to fluoxetine on measures of fatigue and function in one fair -quality trial but represents an insuffici ent strength of evidence given that it was a single study of small sample size. Harms were not well reported leaving insufficient evidence , however patients receiving GET reported more adverse events compared with CBT, adaptive pacing, or usual care in one good- quality trial, and fewer patients in the CBT group reported having serious adverse events versus all others combined (6% vs. 11%, p=.03) .121 The PACE trial described previously was a large 12-month good- quality trial (n=641) comparing four interventions: CBT , GET , an adaptive pacing therapy , and a usual care control group.121 Attrition was low with only 1.7 percent withdrawing overall and adherence was not reported . Compared with the control and adaptive pacing groups, at 1 year the CBT and GET groups reported similar improvement in fatigue scores, functioning score s, and work impairment scores . Both CBT and GET groups reported great er improvement on the self-rated CGI at 1 year compared with both the control and adaptive pacing therapy groups (OR of positive change vs. negative change for CBT vs. control: 2.2; 95% CI, 95% CI, GET 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.3; p-0.028) . Similar results for fatigue and function were found when the data w ere reanalyzed for those patients fulfilling the CDC (Reeves, 2003) criteria ( n=427) , and London (Dowsett, 1994) criteria (n=329) . The investigators also consi dered the outcome of recovery (t rial and clinical recovery described earlier ).123 They found no difference between CBT (32 of 143, 22%) and GET (32 of 143, 22%) , both of which were better than adaptive pacing (12 of 149, 8%) and usual care (11 of 150, 7%) .123 Harms were 62 reported as nonserious and serious adverse events, serious adverse reactions attributed to the treatment, and serious deteriora tion. Nonserious adverse events were reported often ; however , the CBT group reported fewer events (848) compared with all groups (usual care: 977; adaptive pacing therapy: 949; GET: 992) , and fewer patients in the CBT group reported having ser ious adverse events versus all others combined (6% vs. 11%, p=.03) .122 A post -hoc analysis revealed that frequency of nonserious adverse event reporting was associated with the center at which the patient was seen . When adjusted for center, factors affecting the reporting of a nonserious adverse event included baseline CFS symptom count (OR 1.12; 95% CI , 1.01 to 1.24, p= 0.03), baseline current depressive disorder (OR 1.47; 95% CI , 1.04 to 2.07), a nd log body mass index (OR 2.55; 95% CI, 1.09 to 5.96, p= 0.03) .122 Serious adverse reactions attributed to the treatment were rare, and although more were reported by the GET group (17) compared with all groups (control: 7; adaptive pacing therapy: 16; CBT: 8), this was not statistically significant. The limitations of this study ha ve already been extensively reviewed in the section on Cou nseling and Behavioral T herapies. A fair -quality trial (n=114) compared CBT with cognitive therapy, with an anaerobic activity therapy, and with a relaxation techniques control group; this study followed participants for 12 months and measured fatigue usin g the FSS, quality of life using the QLS, functioning using the SF-36 physical functioning subscale, and employment status.108 Overall 25 percent of indivi duals dropped out (not reported per group) and individuals attended an average of 10 out of 13 sessions. At 12 months the CBT group and the cognitive therapy group had statistically significantly better functioning scores compared with the anaerobic activi ty therapy group (mean scores: 58.64 vs. 61.09 vs. 39.72; p<0.01) . There were no differences in employment status, fatigue scores, 6-minute walk test, or quality of life scores, and harms were not reported . Most continued to meet the criteria for CFS at co mpletion and there w ere no significant differences between groups . Fluoxetine and/or GET were compared in a previously described trial with 6- month measurements of fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Scale) and functional capacity measuring the amount of oxygen cons umed in the final minute of exercise per kg of body weight.90 GET was superior to fluoxetine and/or placebo on all measures . Total withdrawal was greatest in th e GET group compared with the nonexercise groups (37% vs. 22%). The other combination trial was a fair- quality trial (n=120) that compared group CBT and group GET with a usual care control group; this study followed participants for 12 months and measured fatigue using the FIS and function using the SF-36 physical functioning subscale.111 Adherence was not reported, but attrition was low overall (4.2%) . Neither fatigue nor functioning scores were significantly different at 12 months followup and harms were not reported. In summary, head -to-head trials had mixed results . Functional improvement with C BT and GET, as well as CBT and cognitive therapy appear similar and better than control groups .108,121 Fatigue may be similar between CBT and GET , and better than control groups as noted in one large trial121 but one trial of CBT plus GET found no difference compared with the control.111 In considering non- head -to-head trial data, CBT and GET provide d similar improvement in measures of function and possibly fatigue , while the evidence was insufficient for other outcomes and comparisons . No study used a case definition selecting for more disabled patients and subgroup analysis of patients with PEM or cognitive impairment was lacking ; these factors limit interpretation of the overall results . GET was superior to fluoxetine but the strength of evidence is insufficient , given that this comparison was only studied in one small fair -quality trial. Harms were again poorly reported and have not been adequately studied in subgroups with PEM or more severely disabled patients . When reported, harms of CBT appear to be less than with GET. 63 Table 7.

What are the characteristics of responders and nonresponders to interventions? Key Points Evidence on patient characteristics associated with response/nonresponse to treatment was insufficient \u2014evidence was limited to four small fair-quality trials that considered different characteristics . One trial found that those who had lower functional impairment, less fatigue, and less pain at baseline were more likely to improve after group CBT . One trial found that younger patients with shorter illness durations and less severe mobility problems at baseline responded better . One trial found that a reduction in symptom focusing was associated with improvement in self -reported measures of function, fatigue, and global improvement . One trial found that patients who avoided over or under exertion (stayed within their energy env elope) and had 75 percent or better compliance with their home program had improvement in fatigue and function measures . Detailed Synthesis Four trials contribute to the understanding of characteristics of pati ents more likely to respond to therapies for ME/CFS . Results of these studies suggest that younger patients with less impairment, have less symptom focusing , and are compliant with homework are more likely to improve in some measures of fatigue and/or func tion.100,105,106,119,127 Staying within one 's energy envelope also appeared beneficial ; however , evidence for these factors is insufficient to determine its applicability to all patients with M E/CFS . One fair-quality trial described above100 compared group CBT with a wait list control and conducted a separate analysis to compare the baseline measur es of those who improved with group CBT (n=10) and those who did not improve (n=17) at 6 months (Table G 4). Those who improved were more likely to have less func tional impairment on the SIP -8 (1,330 vs. 1,985; less daily self-rated observed fatig ue on the Chalder Fatigue Scale (7.4 vs. 9.7 on a scale of 0 to 11; p=0.023), and less daily self-rated observed pain (4.5 vs. 7.8; p=0.026) compared with those who did not improve with group CBT . Though the difference did not reach statistical significanc e, those who improved were more likely to be working more hours per week compared with those who did not improve (10.9 vs. 2.6; p=0.062) . There were no differences between those who improved on group CBT and those who did not on baseline measures of age, education, duration of illness, CIS fatigue score, psychological distress, depression, physical attributes, self-efficacy, avoidance of activity, and focusing on bodily symptoms . One trial comparing GET with usual care127 performed multiple regression analysis to determine possible cognitive or physiological mediators affecting response to GET . This study found that self -reported improvement in mental and phy sical fatigue, global change, and physical functioning in the exercise group were all associated with a reduction in symptom focusing.127 Critical to this a nalysis , however , is that patients in the exercise group were also instructed in ways to reduce symptom focusing and to attend to the heart rate monitor for feedback as to whether their activity level was safe or not . This places an expectation bias into t he results . 66 One trial conducted post hoc analyses to determine which factors may predict change on the Chalder Fatigue Scale in patients who received pragmatic rehabilitation . This study found significant effect for age ( -0.10; 95% CI, - 0.19 to to - 0.003; p=0.008), and by EQ -5D 0.40; p=0.024) . Those who were younger, had shorter illness durations, and less severe mobility problems a t baseline showed greater improvements in fatigue at 70 weeks.119 One trial conducted post hoc analyses based on whether or not individuals stayed within their energy envelope, meaning they avoided overexertion and under exertion by exerting a comfortable range of energy, or strayed outside their energy envelope.106 Individuals rated their perceived energy and expended energy and this was used to determine which individuals stayed within their energy envelope (n=49) and which were outside their energy envelope (n=32) . At 12 months there was a statistically significant improvement in mean fatigue and functioning scores from baseline for those who stayed within their energy envelope compared with those who were outside their energy envelope (fatigue scores: - 0.9 vs. 0.1; p<0.01 and functioning scores: 17 vs. 0; p=0.03) . The second additional analysis compared fatigue and functioning outcomes based on homework compliance. 105 The researchers identified three groups based on the am ount of homework completed; minimum compliance completed 0 to 25 percent, moderate compliance completed 25.1 to 75 percent, and maximum compliance completed 75.1 to 100 percent of their assigned homework. When they assigned individuals to groups they noted that the highest percentage in the maximum group (56%) were in the cognitive therapy group, the highest percentage in the moderate group (34%) were in the CBT group, and the highest percentage in the minimum group (38%) were in the anaerobic and relaxation groups . At 12 months, though there was a trend toward better improvement in fatigue and functioning scores for the maximum compliance group compared with the other groups , this did not reach significance. No other studies evaluated characteristics of responders and nonresponders to interventions. 67 Discussion Key Findings Thirty -six studies contributed to our understanding of diagnostic methods, diagnostic accuracy or concordance, and benefit s or harms associated with a diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyel itis/chronic fatigue s yndrome (ME/CFS ). Multiple case definitions have been used to define ME/CFS , and those that are labeled as myalgic encephalomyelitis ( ME) and require the presence of post -exertional malaise ( PEM ) and other neurological and autonomic manifestations appear to represent a smaller but more impaired population. Validating new diagnostic tests is challenged by the lack of a ' gold standard' or univer sally accepted case definition. A self -reported symptom scale, the artificial neural network t est, was found to have good sensitivity (95%), specificity (85%) , and accuracy (90%) for identifying patients with ME/CFS compared with healthy controls. Another, the Schedule of Fatigue and Anergia for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome ( CFS) scale, and certain 36-item Short Form Survey ( SF-36) subscales or combination of subscales show moderate ability to discriminate between patients with ME/CFS compared with those without the condition. However, none have been adequately tested in a large population to determine validity and generalizability . Other tests , including serum parameters and cardiopulmonary function and recovery, have been insufficiently tested in broad populations to determine utility . We found little evidence on how diagnostic tests for ME/CFS vary by subgroups of the population and few studies that evaluated strategies on approaching the diagnostic workup to rule out other conditions prior to making a ME/ CFS diagnosis . Evidence suggests that having an ME/CFS diagnosis is associated with perceived stigma, financial instability, difficulty in social interactions and relationships, and a greater risk of receiving a psychiatric diagnosis Thirty -five trials contributed to our understanding of the efficacy of interventions to treat ME/CFS . Although most of the medication trials target ed an underlying pathophysiological dysfunction, most of the other treatments target ed associated symptoms of the disease. Trials of the immune modulator , rintatolimod, found improvement in exercise performance and suggested potential improvement in symptoms , including activities of daily living, and reduced use of other medications for relief of ME/CFS symptoms . A trial of the antiviral, valganciclovir, suggested improvement in fatigue, but further studies are required to determ ine if this is replicable . Different complementary and alternative ( CAM ) therapies have been studied only in small pilot trials with methodological limitations , and although homeopathy, pollen extracts, and carnitine preparations found improvement on some measures from baseline, methodological limitations and inconsistency in results across different measurement tools preclude any determination of potential effectiveness . Harms of CAM therapies have been poorly reported. Counseling, behavioral therapies, an d graded exercise therapy ( GET ) were found to be beneficial compared with control groups for outcomes of fatigue, function, and clinical global impression of change . Counseling techniques were also beneficial for outcomes of quality of life and employment . The magnitude of benefit is likely similar between cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and GET ; however , the studies selected for less disabled patients as they did not use a case definition of ME. Only one study of C BT and GET performed a subgroup analysi s on patients meeting the London (Dowsett, 1994) criteria and may have been underpowered to detect a difference . Furthermore, benefit was lost in a sub- analysis that only considered studies using formal CBT approaches . The ultimate goal is recovery and the lack of consistent and meaningful outcome thresholds for measuring recovery limit any interpretation of the results from the few trials that 68 considered this outcome . Results of four small trials suggest that younger, less di sabled patients who focus less on their symptoms and avoid over or under exertion seem to do better . No differences were found for all other interventions and outcomes, as outcomes were either not reported, the study quality was poor, and/or the sample size was inadequa te to provide a useful estimate . Although harms were not well reported across trials, GET was associated with a high er number of reported harms in several trials , higher withdrawal rates in one trial, and refusal for repeat exercise testing in another . The key findings for this review are summarized in the summary of evidence table ( Table 8 , below) and the factors used to determine the overall strength of evidence grades are summarized in Appendix K . Strength of Evidence Our assessment of the strength of the evidence for ma jor clinical outcomes is summarized in the strength of evidence table ( Appendix K ). We did not summarize the strength of evidence on diagnostic methods (Key Q uestion 1) because the methods for doing so are not yet sufficiently developed to account for the variety of study designs, the uncertainty around determination of precision for estimates of test performance, the lack of consensus about the case definition for identifying a consistent study population, and the absenc e of a reference standard ( \"gold standard\" ). 38 For intervention trials, major clinical outcomes are those explicitly stated in K ey Question 2. The National Institutes of Health ( NIH) Working Group and Technical Expert Panel members identified these as important outcomes because they are most relevant to patients, clinicians, and policymakers . Outcomes of benefit included in the strength of evidence table are overall function, fatigue, quality of life, days spent at work/school, proportion working full - or part-time, and clinical global impression of change . Harms o utcomes included in the strength of evidence table are withdrawals due to harms , rates of harms , total withdrawals, serious harms, and total harms . The strength of evidence table includes the four required domains: study limitations, directness, consistency, precision, and reporting bias ( these terms are defined in Appendix F ).31 The table summarizes the strength of evidence. Whe never possible, a quantitative estimation of the effect size was provided. When a quantitative estimate was not possible due to the heterogeneity in me asuring outcomes and the small num ber of studies per intervention, a symbolic representation of effect was included , with + representing benefit, <> representing no difference, and - representing a negative effect. We qualitatively rated the overall streng th of evidence as high, moderate, low, or insufficient for each outcome . Strength of evidence is high for outcomes with a low level study limitations, consistency in results , and adequate precision (certainty surrounding the result) . The strength of eviden ce was downgraded to moderate for outcomes with a medium level of study limitations, imprecise estimates, and inconsistency between trials . Strength of evidence was ranked low if multiple deficiencies existed . Strength of evidence was moderate for GET compared with usual care, support, relaxation or adaptive pacing for outcomes of function, and global improvement , and for CBT for global improvement . Strength of evidence was low for CBT on measures of fatigue, function, quality of life, and employment ; for G ET on measures of fatigue and work impairment; and for rintatolimod on measures of function. There is low strength of evidence that CBT is not associated with an increase in harms . For all other interventions and outcomes, strength of evidence was insuffic ient because these outcomes either were not reported, the study quality was poor, and/or the sample size was inadequate to provide a useful estimate . 69 Table 8. Summary of eviden ce Key Question Outcome Study Design Number of Studies (n)* Findings and Direction of Effect Strength of Evidence Grade KQ1 What methods are available to clinicians to diagnose ME/CFS and what conditions are required to be ruled out or excluded before assigning a diagnosis of ME/CFS? Available methods Not applicable Eight case definitions that include clinical criteria have been developed to identify patients with ME/CFS and are used by clinicians to distinguish ME/CFS from other conditions that also present with fatigue . Not applicable KQ1a What is the accuracy and concord ance of methods used to diagnose ME/CFS? 11 observational descriptive studies (n=1,738) 8 studies evaluated concordance found that the symptoms reported by different case definitions varied. In general, populations defined by ME or ME/CFS criteria had more severe symptoms or more functional impairment than those defined by CFS criteria alone. 3 studies found that symptoms reported by various case definitions distinguished patients with ME/CFS from other populations . Not applicable 11 observational descriptive studies (n=2,067) 11 studies evaluated accuracy of various scales/tools compared to one of the case definitions. Artificial neural networks, t he Schedule of Fatigue and Anergia for CFS scale, and subscales of the SF -36 were able to differentiate ME/CF S patients from healthy controls, however no studies evaluated these methods using an adequate sample size and spectrum of patients. KQ1b How does the use of these methods vary by patient subgroups? 3 observational/ descriptive studies (n=80, 2 studies used the same population of 30 ) Older patients with CFS have more impairment than younger patients . Subscales of the SF -36 can distinguish the subset of CFS patients who fail to recover from cardiopulm onary exercise testing (CPET) 1 day and 1 week. Not appl icable KQ1c What harms are associated with diagnosing ME/CFS? Psychological harm, including stigma from label 5 observational studies (n= 329) 5 studies found that patients with CFS feel stigmatized by their diagnosis in terms of financial stability (1 study ), work opportunities (1 study ), perceived judgments on their character (1 study ), social isolation (2 studies ), or interactions with the health care system (3 studies ). Not applicable Benefit of diagnosis 1 observational study (n=50) 1 study de scribed benefit in having a name for their suffering, and the medical and social legitimacy conferred by having a diagnosis. Not applicable 70 Table 8.

Not applicable Risk from diagnostic test No studies No studies identified that r eported objective risks directly related to the process of conducting a diagnostic test for CFS. Not applicable Prejudice and stereotyping 2 observational studies ( both used same population of n=146) 2 studies identified prejudice and stereotypes within t he medical profession; medical trainees and mental health practitioners make judgments about a patient 's condition based on the name it carries (ME, CFS, or other) and what treatment is being given.

Furthe rmore, there exists the risk of misdiagnosing a patient with an overlapping condition or incorrectly labeling a patient with ME/CFS . ME/CFS is a condition that does not have a universally accepted diagnostic (gold) standard, a set of criteria that defines the condition. The lack of a gold standard poses significant challenges for evaluation of diagnostic tests, and yet this is a situation that arises commonly with conditions that are syndromes . A syndrome is a \"combination of symptoms a nd signs which have been observed to occur together so frequently and to be so distinctive that they constitute a recognizable clinical picture. \"130 That is , the combination of findings is so unusual as to be thought not a coincidence. In such situations, the traditional evaluation of a diagnostic test is more challenging The ME/CFS literature is beginning to test diagnostic strategies but as yet has not presented data that would sufficiently differentiate the diagnosis of ME/CFS from other similar conditions in a population of patients with substantial diagnostic uncertainty . One of the primary limitations in the literature about diagnostic tests for ME/CFS was that very few studies included a validation cohort . Instead, these studies primarily evaluated a diagnostic test in a single initial population (a derivation cohort) . Derivation studies are a necessary first step when attempting to achieve a valid diagnostic test, but they also have inherent methodological problems . They often involve the use of cases and controls , two very distinct populations , in order to determine whether the test can distinguish between those two groups. If the test is capable of distinguishing between two distinct groups, then further testing should use populations that are more closely related (i.e., they have overlap in terms of symptoms), in order to more rigorously test the diagnostic capability of a particular test. The more rigorous diagnostic testing studies will include a population for whom the clinician is likely to face diagnostic uncertainty, and then test how well the test performs in classifying that population accurately . The studies identified for evaluation of diagnostic tests for ME/CFS fell into three main categories . The first are those that evaluated how those case definitions compare with each other, and whether they identify the same or different populations . While this was not a distinct Key Question , it was felt to shed light on the evolving definition of ME/CFS and the difficulty with identifying a universally acceptable reference standard . A second group of studies evaluated a diagnostic test or a scale against a chosen referen ce standard . In this case, the reference standard was typically one or more of several case definitions that have been published (CDC Holmes, 1988 or Fukuda, 1994, Canadian ME/CFS definition, International Consensus Criteria for ME, etc.) . The third group of studies identified are those that address harms of diagnosis . There were no studies that quantitatively compared the diagnostic concordance of two case definitions . Several studies attempted to demonstrate that ME, ME/CFS, and CFS case definitions ident ify clinically different groups of people . Studies did this by identifying people who met one criteria set but not the other.5,9,50-52 Using this approach, it appears that the ME and ME/CFS case definitions select a population with more impairment, lower functioning, and higher symptom reporting compared with CFS alone. Other studies compared subjects who met a definition of CFS with subjects who had other disease states and/or those who compris ed a healthy control population.57-59 As expected, these studies demonstrated CFS subjects have lower functioning and higher symptom burdens than people from the general population. 80 Using a slightly different approach, a prior systematic review compared case definitions for ME/CFS to summarize how the prevalence of ME/CFS in a population and the symptom burden for patients vary when using different case definitions.131 That study attempted to bring some consistency to case definitions for ME/CFS in the absence of a reference standard . The inclusion criteria were broader than those for this report but similarly found t hat the validation studies were weak and heterogeneous . This group called for the community of ME/CFS researchers to prioritize research on treatments using existing case definitions, rather than development of additional new case definitions.131 They felt the CDC ( Fukuda, 1994 ) criteria had the most studies on validation and comparison wit h other measures and was the most appropriate for clinical practice . Notably, many of the intervention studies used the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition for inclusion, yet it has been criticized as being so nonspecific that it is unable to differenti ate a patient with ME/CFS from a patient with an overlapping condition. The Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria has been shown to include more patients than either the CDC (Fukuda, 1994) or the London ME (Dowsett, 1994) criteria . In the PACE trial, only 30 perc ent of patients enrolled using the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition also met the London (Dowsett, 1994) case definition for ME .121 Indee d, when comparing cr iteria across different case definitions, the symptom set of the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition is more generalized and as such is at greater risk of including patients with other overlapping conditions . Based on feedback from public comments to the draft of this review, patients and advocacy gro ups prefer the Canadian or International case definitions and have argued strongly against using a case definition that does not require the presence of PEM . (An Open Letter was received during the public com ment period for this review from 53 advocates and experts) . Much research in this field focuses on discovering etiologies rather than testing diagnostic strategies in patients . Studies that attempted to define an etiology on the basis of a biochemical mark er or a particular physiologic test were not included in this review ; the intent of these studies was to identify an etiology rather than understand how the specific test could distinguish patients that would respond to treatment . In addition to biomarker studies (cell function, immunologic, virologic/bacteriologic, hormonal, etc.), studies identified subgroups on the basis of exercise testing, 132,133 cerebral blood flow as measured by arterial spin labeling,134 gait kinetics,135 impaired blood pressure variability/hemodynamic instability,136,137 bioenergetics (capacity to recover from acidosis),138 and many others . These studies did not report diagnostic testing outcomes, such as recei ver operating curve ( ROC )/area under the curve ( AUC ), sensitivity, specificity, or concordance , and were therefore not useful in evaluating diagnostic testing for this report . The studies on serum biomarkers and cardiopulmonary function/recovery that did m eet the inclusion criteria were not adequately tested in a broad spectrum of patients to determine utility for distinguishing patients with ME/CFS compared with other patients with chronic and disabling conditions. In research studies, p atients with ME/CFS report ed feeling stigmatized by their diagnosis in terms of financial stability, work opportunities, perceived judgments on their character, social isolation, and interactions with health care providers . Compounding these difficulties is the substantial burden of misdiagnosis among this patient population. Two studies objectively identified prejudice and stereotypes towards patients with ME/CFS from members of the medical community; medical trainees and mental health practitioners make judgments about a patient' s condition based on the name it carries (ME, CFS, or other) and which treatment is being given . While these studies were descri ptive and based on survey data, the results suggest valid concerns 81 about the harm of labeling patients with a diagnosis of ME/CFS . These harms may reflect the chronic and disabling nature of this disease, combined with a lack of understanding about the diagnosis among the medical community and uncertainty about the etiology of ME/CFS . One commentary suggested that the harm is associated with the implications of a label rather than the label itself , and that it is \" acceptable and often beneficial to make diagnoses such as CFS, provided that this is the beginning and not the end, of the therapeutic encounter.\"139 Determining the efficacy of medication and CAM interventions to treat ME/CFS was limited because most were only evaluated in single studies at one center and had significant methodological limitations , including small sample sizes with some enrolling fewer than 20 subjects in one arm . Additionally, outcomes were assessed using different methods and different scales . Some medication trials were primarily intended to measure intermediate outcomes, such as natural killer cell- mediated cytotoxicity,89 and most were underpowered for the health outcomes relevant to this systematic review . While several fatigue and function outcomes were based on validated scales and measures, others were not, and the clinical significance of changes in scores over time are not clear . Although placebo -controlled trials of immune modulating and antiviral medications suggested potential improvement in fatigue and functioning , some findings were o f borderline statistical significance and other outcomes did not differ between groups . The rationale for treating patients with medications that have antiviral or immunomodulatory properties is based on the association of ME/CFS with viruses and immunolog ical abnormalities that may underlie or promote its pathogenesis. 18,140-142 Although small trials of acyclovir,91 immunoglobulin G,85,143 and isoprinosine89 indicated no statistically significant differences between treatment and placebo groups for measures of fatigue, quality of life, or function, two trials of intravenous rintatolimod87,88 and a trial of oral valganciclovir86 suggested improvement . These trials differed from the earlier trials by using newer medications and applying selective inclusion criteria for participants that targeted patient subgroups based on clinical history of a likely viral onset of ME/CFS and high antibody titers86 or severe disability.87,88 However, most of these trials were meant as pilot studies to determine potential benefit and as a foundation for larger trials of longer duration. The results were not definitive and were limited by inconsistencies in methods and findings, small sample sizes , methodological shortcomings, and lack of long term followup. Trials of galantamine, hydrocortisone, and immunoglobulin G indicated no significant improvement compared with placebo . Harms related to medications that were statistically significantly higher for the treatment versus placebo groups included suppression of adrenal glucocorticoi d responsiveness, increased appetite , weight gain, and difficulty sleeping with hydrocortisone; flu-like syndrome, chills, vasodilatation, dyspnea, and dry skin with rintatolimod; and headaches with immunoglobulin G . Consistent with other systematic reviews, both CBT and GET were found to improve symptoms, primarily based on fatigue and function outcomes, whereas evidence on other nonpharmacological interventions was inconclusive.144-147 Results need to be interpreted with caution given that studies often used multiple methods of evaluating outcomes and several had mixed results on the same outcome wh en comparing different tools . No study included patients based on a case definition for ME and only one included homebound patients . One study performed a subgroup analysis of those meeting the London ME (Dowsett, 1994) case definition but may have been too small to detect a difference even if a difference existed .121 Recovery as an outcome was reported in few trials and the variability in definition and thresholds leave the results meaningless for comparison. In the PACE tri al, the criteria for inclusion was a SF -36 82 physical functioning score of 65 or less (revised protocol) , yet the threshold for recovery was a score of 60 or more , and the Chalder fatigue score was less than 1 8, while normal is considered less than 4. An ide al definition of recovery would really mean a return to baseline function, which would be unique to each individual . Since this would be a difficult measure for research purposes, refining an acceptable definition with meaningful values is needed. Another critique of this literature is that some investigators teach patients that the disease is psychologically -based and caused by misperceptions and volitional deconditioning . By then educati ng and training patients that they can overcome their disease by chan ging attitudes, patients would expect to do better and consequently they report improvement on self -reported surveys . When considering responders compared with nonresponders to treatments, one study comparing GET with usual care found that a reduction in symptom focusing was associated with improvement in self -reported measures of function, fatigue, and global change .127 In a different fair-quality study usi ng a cluster analysis to identify coping strategies for ME/CFS patients, the investigators determined standardized discriminant function and structure coefficients for three clusters.148 One function separated the clusters and was significant (F=3.31, p=0.01) and accounted for 10 percent of the variance between groups (R c=0.32) . Adaptive coping accounted for 56 percent of the variance explained by the function (R s=0.75) and less adaptive coping accounted for 25 percent (R s=0.50) . These strategies have obvious merit in general but also raise the question of whether reported improve ments translate into meaningful change ( i.e., returning to work, maintaining a household, meeting the demands of parenting) . This question remains unanswered in the current literature. Additionally , although some of the studies attempted to measure adherence, inherent inaccuracies exist with self -reporting, particularly when it applies to home exercise programs . The one trial that considered homework compliance found that degree of improvement paralleled degree of homework compliance ; however , only the cognitive therapy group had 75 percent or greater compliance and GET was not evaluated . It remains uncertain whether improved adherence , particularly with GET , is associated with greater benefit and meaningful change or greater harm . Harms were not well reported throughout all of the nonpharmacological and CAM interventions . When reported, t he harms associated with exercise included total, serious adverse events, nonserious adverse events, harms attributable to treatment , or withdrawal due to harms , but the specific harms were not delineated.90,108,121,127 In the combination trials, the greatest number of adverse events reported were in the GET arm of one trial,121 lowest adherence was in the exercise arm in another trial,108 and one trial had greatest withdrawal in the exercise arm.90,125,127 Significant number of patients refusing to repeat physiological testing implies significant harm in at least some of the patients .127 Although not scientific, a survey sponsored by the ME Association found that patients believed that GET made more people worse compared with other treatments.149,150 One study comparing CBT with cognitive therapy, anaerobic exercise, or relaxation found that those patients who remaine d within their energy envelope (avoided overexertion and under exertion by exerting a comfortable range of energy) had a significant improvement in mean fatigue and functioning scores regardless of treatment arm. 106 This line of therapy needs to be further studied in varied setting s to determine its utilit y over time and whether these interventions can widen one 's energy envelope and reduce harm . A serious gap in the body of the evidence is the lack of subgroup analysis based on factors or symptom sets such as clinical features at baseline (extent of PEM , autonomic dysfunction, neurocognitive impairment, etc.), severity of disease, duration of disease, and patient demographics . In the current literature, ME definitions were not used for inclusion into any 83 treatment trials and subgroup analysis was rarely performed . Effectiveness and/or harms may differ between patient subgroups , and given the small sample size of most of the trials, combining all patients may have lessened the effect size. A recent systematic review that compared different case definitions agreed that patients should be classified according to their severity and symptom patterns in order to optimally guide therapy and predict prognosis.131 Applicability The applicability of our findi ngs to real -world clinical settings is supported by several features of the body of literature we reviewed . First, we included all recognized case definitions of ME/CFS in order to allow a broad representation of patients . Studies were conducted primarily in the United States or Western Europe and the patient population was predominantly female, which is consistent with clinical practice . Duration of symptoms, while not consistently reported, was broadly represented across studies . The interventions and com parators represented most of the therapeutic modalities commonly used in clinical practice . However, t here are several features of this body of evidence that limit its generalizability to the broader population of patients with ME/CFS , including factors surrounding the diagnosis itself . Given that the condition is a syndrome with a constellation of symptoms and lacking a gold standard for diagnostic comparison, diagnosis is at inherent risk of bias by the opinion of experts . Additionally, numerous comments on the draft report of this review emphasized that PEM is the critical feature of ME/CFS , yet most diagnostic studies used CDC CFS case definitions as reference standards ( Holmes, 1988, Fukuda, 1994, or Reeves, 2005) , which do not require the presence of P EM; no intervention trial used an ME case definition . Many of the diagnostic studies were conducted in a referral based environment and lack ed a broad -based spectrum of patients, some with and some without the disease. Patients from specialty clinics may a lso represent more severe forms of the condition. Additionally, patients from rural centers or who lack insurance or financial resources may not have access to specialty clinics or clinical trials . Patients in research studies tended to be white middle -aged women, and it is unknown if the results in this population are generalizable to other demographic populations . The largest trial, PAC E, excluded patients who could not r ead or speak English and only 7 percent of th e study participants were from ethnic mi norit y populations .121 Few trials enrolled homebound patients , with most trials requiring patients to be well enough to attend multiple sessions of treatment . We elected to include trials using any pre defined case definition but recognize that some of the earlier criteria, in particular the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) criteria, could include patients with 6 months of unexplained fatigue with physical and mental impairm ent but no other specific features of ME/CFS . Applying t his has the potential of inappropriately including patients that would not otherwise be diagnosed with ME/CFS and may provide misleading results . Most of the intervention trials used the Oxford (Sharp e, 1991) or CDC (Fukuda, 1994) case definition s for inclusion and the results may not be applicable to patients meeting case definitions for ME. In clinical practice, treatment of ME/CFS often involves multiple concurrent therapies but we found few trials that compared one intervention with another or that compared a combination of concurrent therapies with another . We also found few trials that selected patients based on symptom patterning . The trial on valganciclovir, an antiviral medication , preselected patients with an inciting febrile event with lymphadenopathy and found improvement in fatigue in this population of ME/CFS , while the trials on immune modulators, which included patients who were severely disabled, found some improvement in exercise capaci ty. Both counseling 84 techniques and GET showed improvement in most outcomes but studies to date have focused on efficacy rather than effectiveness. The combination of CBT and GET has not been adequately studied (one trial) to determine if this is more effective than a single intervention or if some patients may do better with this combination . It remains uncertain whether these results apply to all patients with ME/CFS or if there are patient subgroups that might receive greater benefit or experience greater harm , particularly in the GET trials , due to the lack of subgroup analysis. Limitations of the Evidence Base The main limitation of the evidence base in this review was poor study quality. Most trials did not specify randomization method, did not conceal allocation, and did not mask outcome assessment . Most studies were small and many were underpowered to detect significant differences . Studies were also highly variable in terms of methods used to measure outcomes limiting our ability to combine or compare results across studies. A potential limitation of this review is that important studies whose findings might influence clinical and policy decisionmaking may not have been identified. A comprehensive, broadly inclusive search was conducted that produced 6,175 study titles and abstracts. Although non-English language studies and studies published before 1988 were excluded, it is unlikely that important studies of therapies used in current practice were missed; the general consistency of the findings with ot her systematic reviews provides some assurance that this review was not biased by the selection criteria. This review focused on diagnostic methods that provided data on a test's utility in identifying patients with ME/CFS (receiver operator curve [ROC]/ar ea under the curve [AUC], sensitivity, specificity, concordance). Other testing strategies were not reviewed and may provide further insight methods of identifying patients with ME/CFS. To evaluate the benefits and harms of treatments , studies with durations of 12 weeks or longer were included because of the fluctuating nature of ME/CFS. This approach may have excluded studies of antiviral or other types of medications that are traditionally prescribe d for shorter durations. To account for this, excluded s tudies w ere searched for medication trials t hat were appropriately given for a shorter duration, identifying two trials.91,92 Although intravenous r ituximab was superior to placebo on SF-36 physical health a nd function scores and intravenous acyclovir was similar to placebo on fatigue and wellness scores, these results represent insufficient evidence. Neither study change d the overall conclusions of this report. Out come measurements for this report included overall improvement, fatigue, function, quality of life, and employment, which represent patient-centered functional health outcomes. Some interventions may have provided benefit for other symptoms of ME/CFS, and this review would not have identified these outcomes. There may h ave been bi ased r eporting of results in the literature such th at only s elected studies were published and retrievable and that published studies may have been affected by conflicts of interest, outcome reporting bias, or analysis reporting bias. Reporting bias and conflicts of interest are concerns with an y systematic review. Quantitative analyses t o evaluate the possibility of publication bias for the findings was not conducted because of the heterogeneity across s tudies i n this review, and i n many cases t he lack of key information needed to perform quantitative syntheses generally precluded meaningful comparison of effect sizes. Weighing against the likelihood of publication bias, however, is the fact that the majority of included studies reviewed were small (most <100 patients, many <50) and most reported no significant effect of the intervention. Publication bias typically r esults in s elective publ ication of larger studies and/or those with positive findings , and studies biased by conflicts of interest 85 would also be more likely to report positive findings. A search of gray literature was conducted to look for unpublished data , and no evidence of unreported studies was found. The limited and vague reporting of harms in many studies may suggest outcome reporting bias for these outcomes. Future Research and Implications for the Pathways to Prevention Workshop What Are the Future Research Needs for Definition, Diagnosis, and Treatment of ME/CFS? Given the prevalence and health impacts of ME/CFS, future research is necessary in several areas : Case definitions: Consensus about which case definition is appropriate to use as the gold standard will further advance the study of diagnostic methods for ME/CFS. In the absence of consensus , future studies aimed at clarifying the diagnosis of ME/CFS should consider reporting how well a pa rticular di agnostic te st compares with more than one of the published case definitions. T he lack of a definitive diagnostic test should not discourage the support of intervention and treatment studies . Ideally future intervention studies would consistently use an agreed upon single case definition to reduce variability in the patie nt samples and f acilitate c omparison of therapeutic be nefit across s tudie s. If a s ingle definition cannot be agreed upon, future research shoul d retire the use of the Oxford (Sharpe, 1991) case definition, given that it is at high risk of including patients who may have an alternate fatiguing illness, or whose illness resolves spontaneously with time. Diagnostic instruments: Future studies evaluating the diagnostic capability of instruments for the identification of ME/CFS should include populations that include a broad r a nge of people with relevant conditions that require clinical di s tinction from ME/CFS, such as f ibromyalgia . Thus, the ideal diagnostic test for ME /CFS would a dequately distinguish between ME/CFS and these conditions. Additionally, studies should r eport statistics on how well a particular measure distinguishes a group with ME/CFS from a group t hat does not meet these c riteria \u2014using concordance a nd the net reclassification index. F or physiological a nd metabolic testing, selection of a broader spectrum of patients as a comparative group rather than healthy controls is needed. ME /CFS registry: A national longitudinal registry of patie nts with a diagnosis of ME/CFS would allow for comparison of diagnostic criteria between patients and clarification of diagnoses over time. This strategy could also identify a well -characterized population for use in both diagnostic and treatment trials. Treatment inclusion criteria: U se of selective inclusion criteria as was performed in some of the antiviral and rintatolimod trials may h elp to identify those with greater immunological versus neurological symptom sets, which may aid in furthering the understanding of etiology and diagnosis, as well as targeting treatment approaches. Consideration of the biomarker studies may aid in identifying these subsets of patients. Treatment interventions: Reflective of the current clinical environment in which patients r eceive more than on e treatment, i nterventions should be in mul tipl e s ites, use multicomponent treatments, la rger s a mple s izes based on power calculations for key 86 outcomes, and more rigorous adherence to methodological standards for clinical research. Given the fluctuating nature of the condition, followup periods greater than 1 year would be optimal to determine effectiveness over time . Treatment analyses: Reporting of information about co-interventions, the timing of studied interventions in relation to other interventions, and adherence to interventions would improve the applicability of study findings. S imilarly, stratification of findings by patient characteristics (e.g., baseline severity, comorbidities, demographics, symp tom sets) would help determin e the applicability of different inter ventions for specific patients and situations. It is particularly important for future studies to report findings according to the cardinal features of ME/CFS such as PEM, neurocognitive status, and autonomic function, as treatment choices may differ for subsets of the popul ation. Outcome evaluation: Given t he plethora of outcome measures, t he development of a set of core outcomes including patient-c entered outcomes such as quality of life, emplo ymen t, and t ime spent supine versus active, would help guide research and facilitate future data syntheses. In 2003 Reeves and colleagues recommended using an activity recorder to quantify activity, yet no study included in our review reported on this outcome. With today's readily available personal activity trackers that can record activ ity as well as physiological responses, these outcomes should be easily obtained. Recovery needs to be better defined and should include functionally meaningful outcomes. C learly reporting harms, particularly surrounding exercise therapy and testing and treatment f or specific subgroups, may help identify patien ts more negatively affected by these interventions. Personal activity trackers could also be used to identify harms that result in red uced activity. O ther: Research is ongoing in diagnosing and treating specific symptoms such as PEM or orthostasis , and synthesizing this literature and evaluating its utility in diagnosing the syndrome of ME/CFS or subsets of the population is needed.6,151-157 Further studies are needed to determine the utility of 2-day cardiopulmonary exercise testing to identify ormonitor symptoms of post- exertional malaise. T he stories that were shared by patients and advocates in response to the draft report of this review iterated the devastating impact that this condition has had on patients and their loved ones. Although thi s review has focused on scientific literature, these messages have been heard and appreciated . It is recommended that future studies include the patient and/or advocate voice in the planning and development phases so that future research is relevant and meaningful to those affected by ME/CFS. Conclusions Multiple case definitions for ME/CFS exist. Those that require symptoms of PEM, neurological impairment, and autonomic dysfunction representing a more severe form of the condition. No current diagnostic tool or method has been adequately tested to identify patients when diagnostic uncertainty exists. Reports suggest stigmatization as a potential harm of receiving a diagnosis of ME/CFS; however, no studies specifically evaluated the potential positive aspects of getting a diagnosis such as relief at having an explanation for the symptoms. Although counseling approaches and GET have shown benefit in some measures of fatigue, function, and global improvement, they have not been well studied in subgroups of the population. Most other interventions have insufficient evidence to direct clinical practice. Harm s 87 reporting has been poor , and although GET appears to be associated with worsening symptoms in some patients , the cause remains uncertain . Acceptance of a sing le case definition and development of a core outcome s set would aid future research efforts to study effectiveness of interventions . Use of selective inclusion criteria such as symptom subsets (e.g., neuroendocrine/immune, neurological/neurocognitive, etc .) is needed to better inform diagnosis and treatment of ME/CFS. In general, future research focused on correcting limitations of current evidence is important to move the science forward. 88 References 1. Friedberg F, Bateman L, Bested AC, et al.

Quality Rating Criteria Randomized Controlled Trials Criteria: Initial assembly of comp arable groups : o adequate randomization, including first concealment and whether potential confounders were distributed equally among groups Maintenance of comparable groups (includes attrition, cross -overs, adherence, contamination) Important differential loss to follow up or overall high loss to followup Measurements: equal, reliable, and valid (includes masking of outcome assessment) Clear definition of interventions Important outcomes considered Analysis: intention -to-treat analysis. Definition of ratings based on above criteria: Good: Meets all criteria: c omparable groups are assembled initially and maintained throughout the study (fol lowup at least 80% ); reliable and valid measurement instruments are used and applied equally to the groups; interventions are spelled out clearly; important outcomes are considered; and intention -to-treat analysis is used. Fair: Studies will be graded \" fair\" if any or all of the following problems occur, without the fatal flaws noted in the \"poor\" category below: g enerally comparable groups are assembled initially but some question remains whether some (although not major) differences occurred in follow up; measurement instruments are acceptable (although not the best) and generally applied equally; some but not all important outcomes are considered; and intention -to-treat analysis is done for randmised, controlled trials. Poor: Studies will be graded \" poor\" if any of the following fatal flaws exists: g roups assembled initially are not close to being comparable or maintained throughout the study; unreliable or invalid measurement instruments are used or not applied at all equally among groups (including not masking outcome assessment); and intention -to- treat is lacking. Diagnostic/Concordance Studies Criteria: Test applied to an appropriate spectrum of patients (with and without disease/condition), avoiding case -control design Population tested was consecutive or random Clear eligibility criteria described and rigorous assessment of disease/condition Attrition reported and m inimal loss to followup Test is adequately described and reproducible Test was validated in a second population group Test is an available standard case definition Diagnostic test is applied to all patients E-1 Blinding of outcome assessors to the reference standard Definition of ratings based on above criteria: Good: Evaluates relevant available screening test; uses a credible reference standard; interprets reference standard independently of screening test; reliability of test assessed; has few or handles indet erminate results in a reasonable manner; includes large number (more than 500) broad- spectrum patients with and with out disease; study attempts to enroll a random or consecutive sample of patients who meet inclusion criteria screening cutoffs pre -stated. Fair: Evaluates relevant available screening test; uses reasonable although not best standard; interprets reference standard independent of screening test; moderate sample size (100 to 500 subjects) and a \" medium \" spectrum of patients (i.e. applicable to ma ny settings where the diagnostic test would be applied). Poor: Has important limitation such as: uses inappropriate reference standard; screening test improperly administered; biased ascertainment of reference standard; small sample size (<100) of very nar row selected spectrum of patients (components of study not well described ).

Required domains and their definitions Domain Definition and Elements Score and Application Study Limitations Study limitations is the degree to which the included studies for a given outcome have a high likelihood of adequate protection against bias (i.e., good internal validity), assessed throu gh two main elements: Study design: Whether RCTs or other designs such as nonexperimental or observational studies. Study conduct. Aggregation of ratings of risk of bias of the individual studies under consideration. Score as one of three levels, se parately by type of study design: Low level of study limitations Medium level of study limitations High level of study limitations Directness Directness relates to (a) whether evidence links interventions directly to a health outcome of specifi c importance for the review, and (b) for comparative studies, whether the comparisons are based on head- to-head studies. The EPC should specify the comparison and outcome for which the SOE grade applies. Evidence may be indirect in several situations such as: The outcome being graded is considered intermediate (such as laboratory tests) in a review that is focused on clinical health outcomes (such as morbidity, mortality). Data do not come from head- to-head comparisons but rather from two or more bod ies of evidence to compare interventions A and B \u2014e.g., studies of A vs. placebo and B vs. placebo, or studies of A vs. C and B vs. C but not direct comparisons of A vs. B. Data are available only for proxy respondents (e.g., obtained from family members or nurses) instead of directly from patients for situations in which patients are capable of self -reporting and self -report is more reliable. Indirectness always implies that more than one body of evidence is required to link interventions to the most important health outcome. Score as one of two levels: Direct Indirect If the domain score is indirect, EPCs should specify what type of indirectness accounts for the rating. Consistency Consistency is the degree to which included studies find either the same direction or similar magnitude of effect. EPCs can assess this through two main elements: Direction of effect: Effect sizes have the same sign (that is, are on the same side of no effect or a minimally important difference [MID]) Magnit ude of effect: The range of effect sizes is similar. EPCs may consider the overlap of CIs when making this evaluation. The importance of direction vs. magnitude of effect will depend on the key question and EPC judgments. Score as one of three levels: Consistent Inconsistent Unknown (e.g., single study) Single -study evidence bases (including mega- trials) cannot be judged with respect to consistency. In that instance, use \"Consistency unknown (single study). \" 1The set of five required domains comprises the main constructs th at Evidence -based Practice Centers (EPCs) should use for all major outcomes and comparisons of interest. As briefly defined below in Table F1, these domains represent related but separate concepts, and each is scored independently. The concepts are explain ed in more detail in this appendix . F-1 Domain Definition and Elements Score and Application Precision Precision is the degre e of certainty surrounding an effect estimate with respect to a given outcome, based on the sufficiency of sample size and number of events. A body of evidence will generally be imprecise if the optimal information size (OIS) is not met. OIS refers to the minimum number of patients (and events when assessing dichotomous outcomes) needed for an evidence base to be considered adequately powered. If EPCs performed a meta-analysis, then EPCs may also consider whether the CI crossed a threshold for an MID. If a meta -analysis is infeasible or inappropriate, EPCs may consider the narrowness of the range of CIs or the significance level of p-values in the individual studies in the evidence base. Score as one of two levels: Precise Imprecise A preci se estimate is one that would allow users to reach a clinically useful conclusion (e.g., treatment A is more effective than treatment B). Reporting Bias Reporting bias results from selectively publishing or reporting research findings based on the favor ability of direction or magnitude of effect. It includes: Study publication bias, i.e., nonreporting of the full study. Selective outcome reporting bias , i.e., nonreporting (or incomplete reporting) of planned outcomes or reporting of unplanned outcomes. Selective analysis reporting bias, i.e., reporting of one or more favorable analyses for a given outcome while not reporting other, less favorable analyses. Assessment of reporting bias for individual studies depends on many factors -e.g. availabi lity of study protocols, unpublished study documents, and patient - level data. Detecting such bias is likely with access to all relevant documentation and data pertaining to a journal publication, but such access is rarely available. Because methods to det ect reporting bias in observational studies are less certain, this guidance does not require EPCs to assess it for such studies. Score as one of two levels: Suspected Undetected Reporting bias is suspected when: Testing for funnel plot asymmetr y demonstrates a substantial likelihood of bias, And/or A qualitative assessment suggests the likelihood of missing studies, analyses, or outcomes data that may alter the conclusions from the reported evidence. Undetected reporting bias includes all alternative scenarios. Abbreviations: CI = confidence internal; EPC = Evidence-based Practice Center; RCT = randomized, controlled trial; SOE = strength of evidence Study Limitations Domain Definition Scoring the study limitations domain is the essential starting place for grading strength of the body of evidence. It refers to the judgment that the findings from included studies of a treatment (or treatment comparison) for a given outc ome are adequately protected against bias (i.e., have good internal validity), based on the design and conduct of those studies. That is, EPCs assess the ability of the evidence to yield an accurate estimate of the true effect without bias (nonrandom error ). Directness Domain Definition Directness of evidence expresses how closely available evidence measures an outcome of interest. Assessing directness has two parts: directness of outcomes and directness of comparisons. Applicability of evidence (external v alidity) is considered explicitly but separately from strength of evidence. F-2 Consistency Domain Definition Consistency refers to the degree of similarity in the direction of effects or the degree of similarity in the effect sizes (magnitudes of effect) acr oss individual studies within an evidence base. EPCs may choose which of these two notions of consistency (direction or magnitude) they are scoring; they should be explicit about this choice. Precision Domain Definition Precision is the degree of certainty surrounding an estimate of effect with respect to an outcome. It is based on the potential for random error evaluated through the sufficiency of sample size and, in the case of dichotomous outcomes, the number of events. A precise body of evidence should enable decisionmakers to draw conclusions about whether one treatment is inferior, equivalent, or superior to another. Reporting Bias Definition Reporting bias occurs when authors, journals, or both decide to publish or report research findings based on their direction or magnitude of effect. Table 2 defines the three main types of reporting bias that either authors or journals can introduce: publication bias and outcome and analysis reporting bias. Four Strength of Evidence Levels The four levels of grades are intended to communicate to decisionmakers EPCs ' confidence in a body of evidence for a single outcome of a single treatment comparison. Although assigning a grade requires judgment, having a common understanding of the interpretation will be useful for helping EPCs as they conduct their own global assessment and for improving consistency across reviewers and EPCs. Table F 2 summarizes the four levels of grades that EPCs use for the overall assessment of the body of evidence. Grades are denoted high, m oderate, low, and insufficient. They are not designated by Roman numerals or other symbols. EPCs should apply discrete grades and should not use designations such as \" low to moderate \" strength of evidence. Table F2. Strength of evidence grades and definitions Grade Definition High We are very confident that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has few or no deficiencies. We believe that the findings are stable, i.e., another study would not change the conclusions. Moderate We are moderately confident that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has some deficiencies. We believe that the findings are likely to be stable, but some doubt remains. Low We have limited confidence that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has major or numerous deficiencies (or both). We believe that additional evidence is needed before concluding either that the findings are stable or that the estimate of effect is close to the true effect. Insufficient We have no evidence, we are unable to estimate an effect, or we have no confidence in the estimate of effect for this outcome. No evidence is available or the body of evidence has unacceptable deficiencies, precluding reaching a conclusion. Each level has two components. The first, principal definition concerns the level of confidence that EPCs place in the estimate of effect (direction or magnitude of effect) for the F-3 benefit or harm; this equates to their judgment as to how much the evidence reflects a true effect. The second, subsidiary definition involves an assessment of the level of deficiencies in the body of evidence and belief in the stability of the fi ndings, based on domain scores and a more holistic, summary appreciation of the possibly complex interaction among the individual domains. Assigning a grade of high, moderate, or low implies that an evidence base is available from which to estimate an effe ct for either the benefit or the harm. The designations of high, moderate, and low should convey how confident EPCs would be about decisions based on evidence of differing grades, which can be based on either quantitative or qualitative assessment. For com parative effectiveness questions, the comparison is typically a choice of either direction (A>B, A=B, A<B) or magnitude (difference between A and B). In some instances assigning different grades regarding the direction and the magnitude of an effect may be appropriate. An example of this situation is when studies consistently find that an intervention improves an outcome (e.g., apnea -hypopnea index is reduced by a statistically significant amount or beyond a minimally important difference), but the degree of heterogeneity about the estimate is high (e.g., range -10 to - 46 events/minute; I 2=86%). The importance of the distinctions among high, moderate, and low levels (and the distinction with insufficient strength of evidence) can vary by the type of outcome, comparison, and decisionmaker. EPCs understand that some stakeholders may want to take action only when evidence is of high or moderate strength, whereas others may want to understand clearly the implications of low versus insufficient evidence. Even when strength of evidence is low or insufficient, consumers, clinicians, and policymakers may find themselves in the position of having to make choices and decisions, and they may consider factors other than the evidence from a specific systematic review, such as patient values and preferences, costs, or resources.

Evidence table of included studies of methods used to diagnose ME/CFS (continued) Author, year Findings Conclusions Gaab, et al., 200267 There was no difference in the AUC for a wakening salivary cortisol on days 1 and 2 for CFS group vs. control. The decrease in salivary cortisol was lower for all subjects after administration of dexamethasone; with a stronger decrease in patients with CFS:12.16, p=0.003 AUC for awakening cortiso l on day 3 subjects vs.controls: vs.23.4 (5.2), F=22.43, p<0.000. profile vs.controls: 5.67 (0.9) vs.11.67 (1.5), MFI -20, HADS, SCL -90R and SIP -8 were significantly different for CFS subjects vs.controls. See table in paper in salivary f ree cortisol after awakening and exhibit an almost similar circadian salivary cortisol profile. After administration of 0.5 mg of dexamethasone at 11pm, both salivary free cortisol profiles were suppressed in both groups; but in CFS group they remained suppressed for the entire day. Gaab, et al., 200568 The HADS, SCL -90R and SIP -8 scores were all significantly higher in the CFS group AUC for IL -6 vs. reduced ACTH response in the psychosocial stress test, not followed by a similar different in cortisol parameters. CFS patients had an inverted pro- inflammatory cytokine response to stress compared to controls. This confirms prior reports - decreased NF -kB activity in respons e to stress could be a possible intracellular mechanism to mediate the assumed increase glucocorticoid sensitivity. G-27 Table G2.

Exclusion: Patients who did not have complete data, those who did not report any current fatigue, those for whom a diagnostic confidence rating was unavailable, and those whos diagnostic confidence rating suggested that the original diagnosis of CFS was unreliable. Recruitment: 770 subjects with initial clinical diagnoses of CFS were sent followup questionnaire; 624 responded; 613 had usable data. Of those, 368 met final inclusion criteria for CFS. Each CFS subject gave a questionnaire to non- CFS acquaintance (452) and 430 for control.

Recruitment : Patients were recruited from an outpatient population by the study physicians using a predefined standardized examination procedure. Patients with systemic lupus erythematodes and fibromyalgia who also presented with fatigue were also recruited as a comparison group. Compared 4 methods to develop criteria sets for the classification of CFS: a) traditional non -weighted use of classification criteria, b) the we ighting of criteria with regression coefficients, c) regression tree analysis, and d) an artificial neural network (back procrastination method).

Sensitivity, specificity A cut -off score of 1/2 classified 341/368 CFS cases and QROC: 87%, 89% Including the 69 CFS subjects who had a diagnosis other than CFS or for whom there was low confidence in the diagnosis as \"non -cases \" did not change the sensitivity, but reduced the specificity to 83% QROC: 86%, 65% LCA performed on 368 CFS subjects only Sensitivity, specificity Cut-off of > 2: 100%, 90% 4 100% Recommend SOFA/GP instructment with cutoff score 3 to maximize specificity. Longitudinal LCA analysis indicates that symptoms constructs are identafiable cross -sectionally by the SOFA/GP, and that they are stable over time. Linder, et al., 200263 Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy Applied traditional CDC (Holmes, 1988) definition (group A): 62.6%, 93.9%, 78.3% Traditional format B): 90.0%, 65.0%, 77.5%. Three symptoms: sudden onset of fatigue, sore throat, and impaired vision have the greatest discriminatory power in differentiating CFS from systemic lupus erythematosus and fibromyalgia. Weighting of classification criteria with regression coefficients in validation cohort (group B): 90.0%, 75.0%, 82.5% (optimum accuracy is obtained using s udden onset of fatigue, sore throat, and irritability (positive associations); negative associations with GI disturbances, allergies and dyspnea) Regression tree analysis in the validation cohort (group B): 95.0%, 80.0%, 87.5% (at most, 5 symptoms need to be ascertained before a classification can be made) Artificial neural network in the validation cohort (group B): 95.0%, 85.0%, 90.0% (uses 24 of the 26 symptoms) Each method improved upon the prior methods for distinguishing CFS from systemic lupus erythematosus and fibromyalgia. The artificial neural network was superior to other methods tested. Both regression methods also led to good classification of CFS. CFS symptoms with greatest accuracy were acute onset of fatigue and sore throat. Tiev, et al., 200362 Sensitivity: 91% Specificity: 71%. In absence of infection or inflammation, a high RNase L isoform ratio could distinguish CFS subjects from healthy controls. G-33 Table G2.

N=25 women (12 CFS, 13 fibromyalgia) were interviewed to the point of saturation of themes regarding stigma. Two main aspects of stigmat ization were reported 1) Women experienced their moral character being called into question. 2) They experienced distress from being psychologized by others, especially doctors (decided in advance that problems were ficticious or psychological; and that th is experience was deeply violating). Assefi, et al., 200372 To examine self -reported disability in patients with CFS and fibromyalgia, subsyndromal fatigue, compared with chronically fatiguing but unrelated medical condition. N=555 (207 CFS, 76 fibromyalg ia, 87 CFS+fibromyalgia, 31 sybsyndromal fatigue, 154 medical conditions) of 630 (88%) patients from a university CFS clinic responded to a survey about financial, occupational, and personal consequences of their illness.

Deale, et al., 200073 To evaluate patient experience with psychiatric diagnoses in CFS patients; evaluate whether psychiatric illness is overdiagnoses in routine clinical practice among CFS patients. N=68 patients met Oxford criteria (Sharpe, 1991) for CFS completed a questionnaire asking about psychiatric diagnoses or labels given during their illness and then underwent interview to assess for those psychiatric disorders with the DSM III -R. Reported psychiatric diagnosis 46% (31/68) given psychiatric diagnosis (usually depression) 68% (21/31) given depression diagnosis were misdiagnosed 35% (13/37) not given psychiatric diagnosis met DSM III -R criteria for treatable psychiatric disorder, present for 6 months G-37 Table G3. Evidence table of included studies of harms of diagnosis (continued) Author, year Objective N/population Findings Dickson, et al., 200774 To understand participants ' prioritizations and understandings of CFS. N=14 people with with self -reported CFS were interviewed about living with CFS. Reported difficulties about living with CFS 71% (10/14) experienced in getting CFS diagnosis 57% were prescribed antidepressants for depression diagnosis instead of CFS diagnosis Descriptive resultsParticipants reported that they perceived many medical practitioners to hold stereotypical views of patients with CFS, namely that disease was either psychologic al or indicative of an affective disorder. Problems with friends and partners centered on the fact that the patient is not visibly ill, and that the symptoms are inconsistent or variable. Green, et al., 199975 To evaluate stigma among people with CFS. N=45 of 67 (67%) initially recruited patients with CFS reported perceptions of stigma. Reported perceptions of stigma 95% reported feeling estranged 70% thought others attribute their symptoms to psychological or personality 40% felt need to be secretive about their symptoms in some circumstances Guise, et al., 201076 To evaluate ME/CFS sufferers ' descriptions of interactions with medical professionals. N=38 members of an internet -based ME/CFS support group were asked to comment on how they felt about the way medical people treated them. Descriptive results Patients with CFS reported that health professionals lack clinical expertise and empathy; and that they encountered professionals who lacked expectation of treatability, described themselves as fortunate in terms of experiences with medical professionals, and described themselves as able to cope and actively seeking out information and treatment.

St rategies consisted of: identifying links between activity and fatigue; encouragement to plan activity to avoid exacerbation; developing awareness of early warnings of exacerbation; limiting demands and stress; regularly planning rest and relaxation; and al ternating different types of activities; with advice not to undertake activities that demand >70% of participant 's perceived energy envelopes. CBT: Up to 14 sessions in 23 weeks, with booster session offered at 36 weeks, of individual CBT with the aim of c hanging the behavioral and cognitive factors assumed to be responsible for perpetuation of the participant 's symptoms and disability. Strategies guided participants to address unhelpful cognitions, including fears about symptoms or activity by testing them in behavioral experiments, consisting of gradual increases in both physical and mental activity. GET: Up to 14 sessions in 23 weeks, with booster session offered at 36 weeks, of individual GET with the aim of helping the participant gradually return to appropriate physical activities, reverse the deconditioning, and thereby reduce fatigue and disability. Strategies consisted of establishment of baseline achievable exercise or physical activity, followed by a negotiated, incremental increase in the duration of time spent physically active; target heart rate ranges set when necessary to avoid overexertion; which aimed at 30 minutes of light exercise 5 times a week; with mutually agreed upon gradual increases in intensity and aerobic nature of exercises.

Validated in those identified using CDC (Holmes, 1988) criteria22,23 Short Form 12 - Item Health Survey48 SF-12 A health survey with 12 -items assessing physical and mental health. The survey yields 2 summary scores: the mental component summary and the physical component summary. Each summary score ranges from 0-100, higher scores indicate better health. None Sickness Impact Profile 8 -items19,20 SIP-8 Self-reported measure of perceived impact of illness or disease on physical and psychosocial functioning, it can be self or interviewer administered. The 8 subscales used are home management, mobility, alertness behavior, sleep/rest, ambulation, social interactions, work and recreation and pastimes. A total score is calculated by addition of the weights of items (range 0- 5,799). Lower scores indicate better health. None Work and social adjustment scale49 None A 5-item questionnaire that measures i mpairment in in work, home management, social activities, and private leisure. Each item is measured on a 0-8 Likert -type scale where 8=maximum impairment. The scale is scored from 0-45.
