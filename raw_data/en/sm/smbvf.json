These areas have disproportion - ately high rates of lead poisoning and are, therefore, priorities for receiving financial assistance in accordance with CDPH's grant agreements. Additionally, properties currently housing lead poisoned children may receive priority over buildings with - out poisoned children. CDPH may limit participation from those non-priority prop - erties. How Does the Program Work? After receiving an application and related materials, CDPH staff, along with partnering agencies, will review eligibility for the various programs. If the building qualifies, information will be provided detailing the program and what match - ing percentage may be required from the owner. After the agreement is established, lead inspectors from CDPH will identify lead hazards in a home or unit and develop specifications on how to correct them. One or more licensed lead abatement contractors will provide cost estimates based upon a walk- through of the unit(s). Occupants of the unit(s) will be asked to relocate from the work area while the lead work is conducted (see below). Under the supervision of CDPH inspectors, the contractor will conduct the lead work. Once the work is complete, the CDPH inspector will conduct a clearance test, confirming that the lead hazards have been corrected and that any lead dust has been removed. Unit Preparation and Relocation Before lead work can begin, occupants must prepare their unit by moving all belong - ings to the center of the contaminated room so they can be safely covered. No one besides the contractors' staff is allowed in the residence while lead work is occurring. Occupants are encouraged to stay with family or friends for the duration of the work. Occupants unable to completely relocate may be allowed to return to the unit overnight but must vacate during the day. CDPH offers a small incentive to tenants to help offset the cost and inconvenience of having to temporarily relocate. Application To apply for this program, please complete an application and submit all required support - ing documentation. Applications are available in English and Spanish on the CDPH web - site, at www.cityofchicago.org/health (click on \"childhood lead poisoning prevention\" under \"environmental health\") or call 312-746-6520 to request an application by mail or fax.

Parents: Make sure your children receive regular lead tests from their pediatrician. All Chicago children should receive a lead test starting at six months of age and continuing through six years of age. Ask your child's doctor or medical provider to screen yo ur child at your next appointment. If your child does not have a doctor, you can make an appointment at a CDPH clinic. Call 311 to find the clinic nearest you. Parents should also make sure their homes are free from lead hazards, as required by City Ordinance. Tenants can call 311 to request a free lead inspection. Landlords: Chicago City Ordinance requires that all residential properties are free from lead hazards. Rather than wait for a City Inspector to issue citations and face fines for non- compliance, landlords are encouraged to learn about lead and address problems before they become hazards. For more information on lead or to learn about lead classes, call the CDPH lead program at 312-747-LEAD (5323). Renovators and Contractors: If done improperly, renovation activity can create lead dust, which may then poison a child. Whenever working in properties built before 1978, contractors should presume lead might be present and use lead safe work practices to minimize the amount of dust generated. To learn about classes on lead safe work practices, call the CDPH lead program at 312-747-LEAD (5323).their properties in a lead safe fashion to ensure hazards do not re-occur. Owners or their representatives are required to attend a two-hour class on lead safety at CDPH. What every Chicago resident needs to know about financial assistance programs available to property owners for eliminating lead hazards What every Chicago resident needs to know about financial assistance programs available to property owners for eliminating lead hazardsLead Poisoning is a Serious Problem in Chicago. . . Chicago leads the nation in the number of children identified as lead poisoned. In 2005, more than 3,600 of our children were lead poisoned, with thousands more being harmed by lead. Most children are lead poisoned in their own homes. Homes built before 1978 may have lead paint, which can deteriorate and create leaded dust that can poison a child. Improperly performed repair or renovation work can actually make the problem worse. Lead is dangerous to persons of all ages and can damage kidneys, red blood cells, and the nervous system. However, lead is especially danger - ous to children six years old and younger. Even the smallest amounts of lead can interfere with a child's brain development, and can result in a permanent reduction in intelligence and may cause behavioral and/or learning problems. The only way to protect children from lead poisoning is to remove lead hazards from their environ - ment. Not only is this best for children, it is also the law in Chicago. Chicago's lead ordinance prohibits the presence of lead hazards in all residential property. . . . And the City of Chicago Wants to Help You Solve it The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) has several programs to provide financial assistance to property owners for removing lead hazards. Thanks to grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and from Cook County, CDPH is able to pay for 50% to 100% of lead hazard abatement costs at eligible properties. What is Lead Abatement/ Mitigation? Lead abatement or mitigation aids in the removal of lead hazards from the home environment. Lead-based paint is considered a hazard only when it is deteriorated or on a \"friction surface\" -where a painted component rubs against another surface. The most cost effec - tive solutions to hazards are used in CDPH's programs. These may involve encapsulating lead (covering with a durable coating), enclos - ing leaded components (placing a durable barrier, such as gypsum board, over a leaded surface), or replacing leaded components completely. Encapsulating or enclosing surfaces is what is most often done. Rarely can all lead be removed from a home. Since windows are a major source of leaded dust in Chicago homes, window replacement will almost always be a treatment in CDPH's program. Windows will be replaced with high quality, energy efficient windows, helping to eliminate drafts and decrease energy costs as well as providing lead safety. Eligibility Assistance for those needing lead abate - ment or mitigation is offered as grants, loans, or forgivable loans. Eligibility varies based on the program, and can only be determined upon application. In general all properties must: Have been built before 1978, Be adequately insured, Be current on taxes, Be in reasonably good condition beyond the existing lead problems, Have a clean title (The property cannot be in foreclosure. Also, special rules may apply to trusts or recently purchased properties.), Have identifiable lead haz - ards (If the property was not already inspected, CDPH inspectors will identify hazards before any work starts. You do not need to have hazards identi - fied before applying to the program.), and Have all units in the building partici - pate in the program. CDPH will not do a single unit in a multi-unit building. Single Family Homes/Properties with less than four units can qualify for up to 100% of the abatement costs, depend - ing on the owner's income level and the number of units, if: A child six or younger lives at or regu - larly visits the property. The property owner makes less than 120% of the Area Median Income which is up to $90,400 for a family of four in 2007. Multi-family homes with four or more units can qualify for up to 50% of the abatement costs if: The majority of the rental units are affordable, i.e., they are less than 30% of the 50% Area Median Income or approximately $940 per month in 2007. The owner and building meet financ - ing criteria for the 50% match All property owners, for at least three years following completion of the work, are required to agree to keep rents affordable and offer priority to those renting families with young children. In some cases, if the property is sold within three years, the grants or loans may be subject to re-capture. Owners must also agree to maintain "}
