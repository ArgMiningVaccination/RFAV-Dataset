The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus termed SARS-CoV-2, has spread quickly worldwide. Convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from patients following recovery from COVID-19 infection and development of antibodies against the virus is an attractive option for either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment, since antibodies may have direct or indirect antiviral activities and immunotherapy has proven effective in principle and in many clinical reports. We seek to characterize the latest advances and evidence in the use of CP for COVID-19 through a systematic review and quantitative analysis, identify knowledge gaps in this setting, and offer recommendations and directives for future research. PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were continuously searched for studies assessing the use of CP for COVID-19, including clinical studies, commentaries, reviews, guidelines or protocols, and in vitro testing of CP antibodies. The screening process and data extraction were performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Quality appraisal of all clinical studies was conducted using a universal tool independent of study designs. A meta-analysis of case-control and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using a random-effects model. Substantial literature has been published covering various aspects of CP therapy for COVID-19. Of the references included in this review, a total of 243 eligible studies including 64 clinical studies, 79 commentary articles, 46 reviews, 19 guidance and protocols, and 35 in vitro testing of CP antibodies matched the criteria. Positive results have been mostly observed so far when using CP for the treatment of COVID-19. There were remarkable heterogeneities in the CP therapy with respect to patient demographics, donor antibody titers, and time and dose of CP administration. The studies assessing the safety of CP treatment reported low incidence of adverse events. Most clinical studies, in particular case reports and case series, had poor quality. Only 1 RCT was of high quality. Randomized and nonrandomized data were found in 2 and 11 studies, respectively, and were included for meta-analysis, suggesting that CP could reduce mortality and increase viral clearance. Despite promising pilot studies, the benefits of CP treatment can only be clearly established through carefully designed RCTs. There is developing support for CP therapy, particularly for patients who are critically ill or mechanically ventilated and resistant to antivirals and supportive care. These studies provide important lessons that should inform the planning of well-designed RCTs to generate more robust knowledge for the efficacy of CP in patients with COVID-19. Future research is necessary to fill the knowledge gap regarding prevention and treatment for patients with COVID-19 with CP while other therapeutics are being developed. SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, was declared a pandemic in early 2020 by the World Health Organization [ The magnitude and urgency of this public health emergency has prompted global scientific collaborations to seek rapid solutions via repurposing of previously approved broad-spectrum antivirals (remdesivir, ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, interferon) [ Despite this incredible progress on COVID-19, many challenges remain post vaccine development including ongoing vaccine deployment, large-scale production and distribution of billions of vaccine doses [ In the absence of definitive treatment against this new human pathogen, clinical management of hospitalized, severely ill patients remains mainly supportive care, including oxygen and mechanical ventilation, and is based largely on preclinical studies or previous experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [ Passive immunotherapy -globulin, or artificially produced monoclonal antibodies are beneficial for treatment or prophylaxis of several infections, and these approaches are under investigation as potential therapeutic modalities for the management and prevention of COVID-19 [ On the other hand, systematic reviews have been conducted for current medications that have been used for the treatment of COVID-19. A comparative analysis of three treatment modalities for COVID-19, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, CP, and remdesivir, found that each modality had both favorable and unfavorable characteristics, but none showed clear evidence of benefit for early outpatient disease or prophylaxis; in particular, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is no longer a viable option [ Studies are currently underway to evaluate use of CP as treatment for patients with severe COVID-19 and to prevent infection (prophylaxis) in certain high-risk patients exposed to COVID-19. Currently, CP is being given to small numbers of hospitalized patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 illness [ There are many ongoing trials and reviews, perspectives, commentaries, and guidelines published every day related to all aspects of COVID-19 CP, ranging from donor selection, plasma collection, testing, and storage to clinical use. In this paper, we sought to review all aspects of CP use for COVID-19, from detection of the level and activity of CP antibodies to appraisal of the quality and meta-analysis of original clinical studies of CP therapy, to characterize the knowledge gap and provide recommendations for future directions. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines [ We searched relevant databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase from June 19, 2020, for published and unpublished trials with no limitations on starting date, with the terms COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR \"coronavirus* 2019\" AND convalescent plasma/ser*; we continued the search and updated the review during the manuscript preparation until October 22, 2020. Both plasma and serum or sera have been used in the literature. In this review, plasma is representative for both terms. Titles and abstracts were screened to determine relevance and, if deemed appropriate, the full article was reviewed. Additional publications were selected from the cross-references listed in the original papers and from the cited articles. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or with another review author. The same strategy was used for data extraction and study appraisal as described later. Experimental (randomized controlled trials [RCTs], quasi-RCTs, non-RCTs), quasi-experimental (controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series), and observational (cohort, case-control) studies are eligible if they examined CP or serum for prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of COVID-19. Review articles were excluded unless they were focused on or directly related to CP (eg, passive immunotherapy) for COVID-19. Papers on antibody detection and immunity were also excluded unless specifically related to CP. All literature search results were screened independently by two reviewers. The commentaries in support of the use of CP for COVID-19 were considered positive, those suggesting improvements in CP treatment were categorized as neutral, and precautions against CP were determined to be negative. The review type was determined according to a typology of reviews by Grant and Booth [ Studies were analyzed separately according to their design (case report, case series, observational, or randomized trials). Clinical and methodological heterogeneities across the studies were assessed by examining the details of the patients, the baseline data, the interventions, and the outcomes to determine whether the studies were sufficiently similar. For disease severity, severe COVID-19 is a clinical situation in which the patient has dyspnea, tachypnea (respiratory rate30 breaths/minute), blood oxygen saturation93% on room air, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <300 PaO2/FiO2<300, or lung infiltrates >50% within 24-48 hours on chest x-ray [ Case and randomized controlled studies were combined in meta-analyses using Review Manager (Version 5.4, The Cochrane Collaboration). Data were pooled using an inverse variance method and analyzed using a random-effects model, as this approach accommodates clinical and statistical variations. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were used as statistical measures for mortality, clinical improvement, and viral clearance as a dichotomous outcome. Mean and SD were the statistical measure used to describe length of hospital stay. In studies that reported data in medians and IQRs, mean and SD were estimated using the sample size in each study arm, the medians, and the first and third IQRs as demonstrated in the method published by Wan et al [ As illustrated in A total of 243 articles were included in this review. As summarized in PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow diagram. The literature search was conducted on June 19 and updated on October 22, 2020. The screening, full-text review, and extraction were managed online using Covidence. CP: convalscent plasma.

There is evidence for a significant decline in neutralizing antibody levels over time [ Studies suggest that the efficacy of CP depends on the antibody levels of the donor plasma and CP, with high antibody levels possibly conferring immediate immunity to recipients [ Prior smaller studies have reported a variety of titer cut-offs [ There was substantial heterogeneity in the antibody response among potential CP donors, but sex, age, and hospitalization emerged as factors that can be used to identify individuals with a high likelihood of having strong antiviral antibody levels [ In addition, CP collection efforts should be organized around the temporal dynamics of the immune response to viral clearance and a rise in neutralizing antibody titer, with a recommended window for plasma collection beginning at 4 weeks after the resolution of symptoms and narrowing rapidly by 12 weeks [ One key factor associated with CP efficacy is the optimal treatment time point [ There was no therapeutic effect from CP treatment on severely or critically ill patients with COVID-19 more than 2 weeks after the onset of disease as reported by Liu et al [ Similar to most viral illnesses, viremia in COVID-19 peaks in the first week of infection, and the primary immune response develops by days 10-14, which is followed by virus clearance. Therefore, transfusion of CP at the early stage of disease theoretically should be more effective [ Based on the current findings, CP treatment should be given to patients with COVID-19 at the right phase or severity of illness and at the right time point. It is known that most patients with mild COVID-19 can recover without treatment, and CP may be an improper therapy for those patients. For patients with end-stage COVID-19, treatment with CP may be unable to avert a poor outcome, as demonstrated by the current findings [ This is in line with one of the first published RCTs of CP, in which Li and colleagues [ Transfusion volume ranged from 2x50 mL [ All studies that assessed adverse events have reported no or minimal adverse events [ Although it is not yet clear whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus is transmitted by blood [ These were measured by SARS-CoV-2 negative PCR tests, improvements of clinical symptoms assessed by respiratory distress and fever, computed tomography, time to death, length of hospital stay, and mortality at discharge. All case reports showed either viral load decrease/clearance or different extents of improvements of clinical symptoms with no mortality. Preliminary evidence from case reports and case series is favorable, as significant clinical and biochemical improvement and hospital discharge have been reported. COVID-19 severity and underlying diseases affected the outcome of CP treatment. A patient with lymphoma who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation showed persistent SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding for 74 days, even with the administration of CP [ Studies demonstrated that CP could effectively improve the respiratory symptoms of severe patients and help them wean from oxygen support. However, patients in extremely critical or life-threatening conditions could not benefit from CP [ The case series reported a mortality rate of 24.4% in 35,666 patients, mainly from 1 study with 35,322 patients [ As indicated in Quality assessment components and their rankings for clinical studies evaluated using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool. |Studies||Patient selection||Study design||Confounders||Blinding||Data collection |Anderson et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Weak| |Bao et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Weak| |Cinar et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Clark et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Weak| |Figlerowicz et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Grisolia et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Hahn et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Hartman et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Weak| |Im et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Weak| |Jafari et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Weak| |Jiang et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Karata et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Weak| |Kong et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Mira et al [ ||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Soleimani and Soleimani [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Weak| |Xu et al [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Weak| |Zhang et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Ahn et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Strong||Weak| |Abdullah et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Weak| |Bradfute et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Diorio et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Strong||Weak| |Enzmann et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Weak| |Erkurt et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Fung et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Gemici et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Hartman et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Weak| |Ibrahim et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Strong||Weak| |Bobek et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Jin et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Joyner et al 2020 [ ||Strong||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Weak| |Joyner et al 2020 [ ||Strong||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Joyner et al 2020 [ ||Strong||Weak||Moderate||Weak||Strong||Strong||Weak| |Liu et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Maor et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Strong||Weak| |Naeem et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Olivares-Gazca et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Pal et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Rahman et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Salazar et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Strong||Weak| |Shen et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Strong||Weak| |Tremblay et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Wang et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Strong||Weak| |Wei et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Weak| |Wu et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Strong||Weak| |Xi et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Weak| |Ye et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Strong||Weak| |Zhang et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Weak||Weak||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Zeng et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Weak||Weak||Weak||Strong||Strong||Weak| |Abolghasemi et al 2020 [ ||Strong||Moderate||Moderate||Weak||Strong||Strong||Moderate| |Duan et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Moderate||Weak||Weak||Strong||Strong||Weak| |Hegerova et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Moderate||Weak||Weak||Strong||Strong||Weak| |Liu et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Moderate||Moderate||Moderate||Strong||Strong||Moderate| |Perotti et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Moderate||Moderate||Weak||Strong||Moderate||Moderate| |Rasheed et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Strong||Strong||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Moderate| |Roger et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Moderate||Moderate||Weak||Strong||Strong||Moderate| |Salazar et al 2020 [ ||Strong||Moderate||Moderate||Weak||Strong||Strong||Moderate| |Xia et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Moderate||Moderate||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Moderate| |Xiao et al 2020 [ ||Weak||Moderate||Moderate||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Weak| |Zeng et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Moderate||Moderate||Weak||Moderate||Strong||Moderate| |Gharbharan et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Strong||Strong||Weak||Strong||Strong||Moderate| |Li et al 2020 [ ||Moderate||Strong||Strong||Moderate||Strong||Strong||Strong| With respect to the study design, case reports and series were considered to be weak; case-control studies and RCTs were determined to be moderate and strong, respectively. The confounders for case reports and series studies were ranked weak given the uncontrolled nature of these studies involving other therapeutic treatments and supportive care and the use of other treatment regimens, including antiviral medications along with CP transfusion. Two different analytical methods were used to control for confounding in 1 case series study [ As CP treatment was not blinded to either outcome assessors or study patients in most studies, the blinding component was judged to be weak except for the RCT by Li et al [ If there was no detailed CP therapy in terms of CP collection, neutralizing antibody or anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers, timing and dose of the treatment, and valid measures of clinical outcomes, the data collection methods of the study were deemed to be weak. Some case reports did not provide any information for CP donators, antibody titers, and adverse events [ There were no dropouts in the case reports and case series. One case series study where all patients were followed up for only 7 days [ Both RCTs were terminated prematurely due to the concerns over the potential benefit of CP in the study population with high neutralizing antibody titers (1:160) at baseline [ However, fewer studies were available to assess the effects of CP treatment on the length of hospital stay, clinical improvement, and viral clearance. We identified only 6 studies (1 RCT and 5 cohort studies) reporting the length of hospital stay, with a total of 366 and 1735 patients in the CP and control groups, respectively ( Similarly, 4 studies (2 RCTs and 2 cohort studies) assessed the clinical improvement with the number of patients in both CP and control groups. As depicted in Based on the 3 studies (1 RCT and 2 cohort studies) with a total of 63 and 65 patients in the CP and control groups, respectively, we found that the use of CP increased the viral clearance significantly (OR 26.21, 95% CI 4.36-157.66; I2=43%) as shown in Efficacy of CP treatment on mortality in COVID-19 patients. Data from 13 controlled clinical trials were pooled using an inverse variance method and analyzed using a random-effects model. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were used as statistical measures for mortality as a dichotomous outcome. CP: convalescent plasma. Efficacy of CP treatment on length of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients. Data from 6 controlled clinical trials were pooled using an inverse variance method and analyzed using a random-effects model. Means and SDs were the statistical measures used to describe the length of hospital stay. CP: convalescent plasma. Efficacy of CP treatment on clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients. Data from 4 controlled clinical trials were pooled using an inverse variance method and analyzed using a random-effects model. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were used as statistical measures for clinical improvement as a dichotomous outcome. CP: convalescent plasma. Efficacy of CP treatment on viral clearance in COVID-19 patients. Data from 3 controlled clinical trials were pooled using an inverse variance method and analyzed using a random-effects model. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were used as statistical measures for viral clearance as a dichotomous outcome. CP: convalescent plasma. Except for the high heterogeneity among the studies on assessing the length of hospital stay (I2=0.98; The biological basis for efficacy of CP entails the transfer of specific antiviral immunoglobulins (antibodies) and other bioactive substances in the plasma of patients in the convalescent phase of COVID-19 infection [ Although not fully elucidated, the protective mechanisms of CP are based on direct and indirect antiviral activities, including antibody neutralization of viral infectivity [ As new strains of SARS-CoV-2 with several dominant mutations in the spike protein have been identified recently, crucial questions associated with the possible reinfection of recovered patients and the efficiencies of vaccines designed based on early epidemic strains have arisen [ This systematic review summarizes a variety of evidence on the use of CP for treatment of COVID-19. Though the focus of this review was to identify and assess the quality of clinical studies reporting CP treatment for COVID-19, the broad search strategy identified a large number of studies related to various aspects of CP use, highlighting substantial research in this field. The data on this topic is being rapidly generated and reported. Most are commentary and review articles and protocol or guidance descriptions on the theme of CP treatments for COVID-19. The main findings according to each group of articles dealing with COVID-19 CP were: Clinical studies: Overall, there were significant variations among the studies regarding the study design and population, the timing of initiation of CP transfusion, dosage and neutralizing antibody titer, and concomitant therapy. The quality of the current evidence on the use of CP for COVID-19 was low. However, there is a widespread belief that CP should be used given that no other efficacious treatment is currently available. Commentary articles: This category mainly consisted of commentary and letter to the editor in addition to a few editorials and perspectives that collectively supported the use of CP for COVID-19 and suggested further clinical trials. Review: The volume and the pace of the clinical trials launched to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CP against COVID-19 reflects the need for high-quality evidence for the therapy to be practiced by clinicians. Protocol and guideline: This category of literature showed the importance for establishment of a CP production and storage transfusion program in a public health care network and a decision-making framework; the requirements applicable to plasma donors; and the standards for preparation, qualification, storage, distribution, and control of product use. In vitro testing of CP: A variety of tests have been developed to measure the levels of CP antibodies. Generally, two methods have been most used to determine antibody titers of CP: ELISA for IgG and IgM, and neutralization assay for neutralizing antibodies. ELISA-based titers can correlate well with neutralizing titers. Our meta-analysis of controlled studies showed significant reduction in mortality by CP therapy in comparison to controls. Similar meta-analysis of the efficacy of CP therapy on different types of infectious disease found a 44% reduction in the mortality of patients with COVID-19 [ Our meta-analysis showed no effect of CP on the length of hospital stay (mean difference), which is consistent with another meta-analysis of 3 RCTs for the effect of CP on the length of hospitalization in other severe respiratory viral infections, as reported by Devasenapathy et al [ The insignificant effect of CP on the improvements of clinical COVID-19 symptoms is comparable to another systematic review and meta-analysis of 5 studies with a total of 259 patients with COVID-19, showing more clinically improved patients treated with CP than no CP treatment but was not statistically significant (OR 2.06, 95% CI 0.8-4.9; I2=44%) [ The significant increase in the viral clearance is also consistent with the other meta-analysis of 2 studies with a total of 144 patients, suggesting that the use of CP helps in viral clearance significantly [ Various tools have been developed for quality assessment involving slightly different components and ranking criteria [ Consistent with other reviews [ The overall quality of the case-control studies in our assessment lies in between the risk of bias assessed by other two systematic reviews conducted by Piechotta et al [ Considering the promising evidence from existing clinical data, there is a clear need for RCTs on large patient numbers to evaluate the efficacy of CP therapy. Apart from sample size and the noncomparative, nonrandomized study design, numerous limitations hamper the interpretation of the aforementioned studies, such as the superimposition of effects mediated by other antiviral treatments, antibiotics, and glucocorticoids administered concomitantly with CP. As a whole, these studies indicate that patients receiving transfusions earlier than 14 days post infection may benefit from CP treatment [ There are 2 systematic reviews and meta-analysis to appraise the literature on CP therapy for patients with COVID-19. However, this review covers the latest literature as of the date of our manuscript submission and provides insights about various aspects for the subject on the use of CP for COVID-19 that needs further investigation. The primary limitation of this review is that most data identified are nonrandomized (only 2 out of 64 clinical studies were randomized, with only 1 being of high quality), and therefore, confounding is highly inevitable. Furthermore, study populations, interventions, and measured outcomes have important clinical and methodological heterogeneity, which reflects an overall low to moderate quality of evidence identified by the appropriate quality assessment tool. Publication bias may be another potential limitation given that the majority of early clinical studies on COVID-19 lacked original data, and those that did were rushed and did not include the appropriate measures to reduce bias [ We summarized various aspects of the evidence on the use of CP in patients with COVID-19. However, important gaps in knowledge remain. Notably, the following areas require further investigation. Well-designed prospective observational studies, preferentially RCTs, with well-defined characteristics for both CP donors and recipients are warranted to answer questions concerning the effects on mortality or other important clinical outcomes such as improvement in symptoms and respiratory status. The placebo or control should include standard-of-care or normal fresh frozen plasma. The plasma exchange has shown therapeutic effects for severe COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome with multiple organ failure [ In vitro testing showed variable or diverse neutralizing antibody titers among individual donors, suggesting that an adequate pooling strategy of plasma units from different donors could reduce the variability of neutralizing antibody titers of CP and compensate deviations of individual antibody titers [ The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially reduced the national ability to provide blood products for medical care in an emergency [ There is still limited evidence but accumulating interest in CP treatment for COVID-19. The theoretical reasons for the likely efficacy of passive immunization, the urgent need felt by clinicians worldwide for effective treatment options for COVID-19, and the promising results offered mainly by retrospective clinical studies must be balanced against the lack of efficacy in the RCTs of CP and hyperimmune globulin therapy in severe influenza and COVID-19. CP may be of greatest benefit for patients who are early in their illness and have not yet generated endogenous antibodies, and when the infused CP has a high antibody titer. Recurring observations suggested that treatment with CP within 4-5 days of symptom onset might be more effective than later treatment. Our systematic review and analysis emphasizes the low quality of clinical studies. These studies could provide important lessons that should inform the planning of adequately powered and properly designed RCTs to evaluate the promise of CP therapy for patients with COVID-19. Future research is necessary to fill the obvious knowledge gaps regarding CP treatment for patients with COVID-19. In brief, we offered recommendations around the need for a large-scale properly designed RCT, the potential prophylactic use of CP, selection criteria for both CP donors and recipients, development of antibodies with higher potency than CP, and freeze-dried CP as a long-term strategy against the pandemic.
