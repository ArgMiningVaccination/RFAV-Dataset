the health status, behaviors and needs of residents in the Hartford Region of Hartford HealthCare's service area . Subsequently, this information may be used to inform decisions and guide efforts to improve community health and wellness. A Community Health Needs Assessment provides information so that communities may identify issues of greatest concern and decide to commit resources to those areas, thereby making the greatest possible impact on community health status. This Community Health Needs Assessment will serve as a tool toward reaching three basic goals: To improve residents' health status, increase their life spans, and elevate th eir overall quality of life. A healthy community is not only one where its residents suffer little from physical and mental illness, but also one where its residents enjoy a high quality of life. To reduce the health disparities among residents. By gathering demographic information along with health status and behavior data, it will be possible to identify population segments that are most at-risk for various diseases and injuries. Intervention plans aimed at targeting these individuals may then be developed to combat some of the socio-economic factors which have historically had a negative impact on residents' health. To increase accessibility to preventive services for all community residents. More accessible preventive services will prove beneficial in accomplishing the first goal (improving health status, increasing life spans, and elevating the quality of life), as well as lowering the costs associated with caring for late-stage diseases resulting from a lack of preventive care. This assessment was conducted on behalf of Hartford HealthCare by Professional Research Consultants, Inc. (PRC). PRC is a nationally-recognized healthcare consulting firm with extensive experience conducting Community Health Needs Assessments such as this in hundreds of communities across the United States since 1994. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 9 Methodology This assessment incorporates data from both quantitative and qualitative sources. Quantitative data input includes primary research (the PRC Community Health Survey) and secondary research (vital statistics and other existing health-related data); these quantitative components allow for comparison to benchmark data at the state and national levels. Qualitative data input includes primary research gathered through an Online Key Informant Survey of various community stakeholders. PRC Community Health Survey Survey Instrument The survey instrument used for this study is based largely on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), as well as various other public health surveys and customized questions addressing gaps in indicator data relative to health promotion and disease prevention objectives and other recognized health issues. The final survey instrument was developed by Hartford HealthCare and PRC. Community Defined for This Assessment The study area for the survey effort (referred to as the \" Hartford Region \" in this report) is defined by 62 residential ZIP Codes in central Connecticut. This area definition is illustrated in the following map. Sample Approach & Design A precise and carefully executed methodology is critical in asserting the validity of the results gathered in th e PRC Community Health Survey . Thus, to ensure the best representation of the population surveyed, a telephone interview methodology \u2014 one that incorporates both landline and cell phone interviews \u2014 was employed. The primary advantages of telephone COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 10 interviewing are timeliness, efficiency and random-selection capabilities. The sample design used for this effort consisted of a random sample of 1, 446 individuals age 18 and older in the Hartford Region . Because this study is part of a larger effort involving multiple regions and hospital service areas, the surveys were distributed among various strata. Once the interviews were completed, these were weighted in proportion to the actual population distribution so as to appropriately represent the Hartford Regi on as a whole. All administration of the surveys, data collection and data analysis was conducted by Professional Research Consultants, Inc. (PRC). For statistical purposes, the maximum rate of error associated with a sample size of 1, 446 respondents is \u00b1 2.6% at the 95 percent level of confidence. Expected Error Ranges for a Sample of 1,446 Respondents at the 95 Percent Level of Confidence Note: The \"response rate\" (the percentage of a population giving a particular response) determines the error rate associated with t hat response. A \"95 percent level of confidence\" indicates that responses would fall within the expected error range on 95 out of 100 trial s. Examples: If 10% of the sample of 1,446 respondents answered a certain question with a \"yes,\" it can be asserted that between 8.4% and 11.6% (10% 1.6%) of the total population would offer this response. If 50% of respondents said \"yes,\" one could be certain with a 95 percent level of confidence that between 47.4% and 52.6% (50 % 2.6%) of the total population would respond if Characteristics To accurately represent the population studied, PRC strives to minimize bias throu gh application of a proven telephone methodology and random-selection techniques. And, while this random sampling of the population produces a highly representative sample, it is a common and preferred practice to \"weight\" the raw data to improve this rep resentativeness even further. This is accomplished by adjusting the results of a random sample to match the geographic distribution and demographic characteristics of the population surveyed (poststratification), so as to eliminate any naturally occurring bias. Specifically, once the raw data are gathered, respondents are examined by key demographic characteristics (namely gender, age, race, ethnicity, and poverty status) and a statistical application package applies weighting variables that produce a sample which more closely matches the population for these characteristics. Thus, while the integrity of each individual's responses is maintained, COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 11 one respondent's responses may contribute to the whole the same weight as, for example, 1.1 respondents. Another respondent, whose demographic characteristics may have been slightly oversampled, may contribute the same weight as 0.9 respondents. The following chart outlines the characteristics of the Hartford Region sample for key demographic variables, compared to actual population characteristics revealed in census data. [Note that the sample consisted solely of area residents age 18 and older; data on children were given by proxy by the person most responsible for that child's healthcare needs, and these chi ldren are not represented demographically in this chart.] Population & Survey Sample Characteristics (Hartford Region, 2015) Sources: Census 2010, Summary File 3 (SF 3). US Census Bureau. 2015 PRC Community Health Survey, Professional Research Consultants, 39 40 to 64 65+ White Hispanic Other <200% FPL Actual Population Weighted Survey Sample Further note that the poverty descriptions and segmentation used in this report are based on administrative poverty thresholds determined by the US Department of Health & Human Services. These guidelines define poverty status by household income level and number of persons in the household (e.g., the 2014 guidelines place the poverty threshold f or a family of four at $23,850 annual household income or lower) . In sample segmentation: \" very low income \" refers to community members living in a household with defined poverty status; \" low income \" refers to households with incomes just above the povert y level, earning up to twice the poverty threshold; and \" mid/high income \" refers to those households living on incomes which are twice or more the federal poverty level. The sample design and the quality control procedures used in the data collection ensur e that the sample is representative. Thus, the findings may be generalized to the total population of community members in the defined area with a high degree of confidence. Online Key Informant Survey To solicit input from key informants, those individuals who have a broad interest in the health of the community, an Online Key Informant Survey was also implemented as part of this COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 12 process. A list of recommended participants was provided by Hartford HealthCare; this list included names and contact information for physicians, public health representatives, other health professionals, social service providers, and a variety of other community leaders. Potential participants were chosen because of their ability to identify primary concerns of the populations with whom they work, as well as of the community overall. Key informants were contacted by email, introducing the purpose of the survey and providing a link to take the survey online; reminder emails were sent as needed to increase participation . In all, 47 community stakeholders in the Hartford Region took part in the Online Key Informant Survey, as outlined below: Online Key Informant Survey Participation Key Informant Type Number Invited Number Participating Community/Business Leader 41 11 Other Hea lth (Non -Physician) 19 16 Physician 10 3 Public Health Expert 9 5 Social Services Representative 27 12 Final participation included representatives of the organizations outlined below.

In the online survey, key i nformants were asked to rate the degree to which various health issues are a problem in their own community. Follow-up questions asked them to describe why they identify problem areas as such, and how these might be better addressed. Results of their ratings, as well as their verbatim comments, are included throughout this report as they relate to the various other data presented. NOTE: These findings represent qualitative rather than quantitative data. The Online Key Informant Survey was designed to gather input from participants regarding their opinions and perceptions of the health of the residents in the area. Thus, these findings are based on perceptions, not facts. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 14 Public Health, Vital Statistics & Other Data A variety of existing (secondary) data sources was consulted to complement the research quality of this Community Health Needs Assessment. Data for the Hartford Region were obtained from the following sources (specific citations are included with the graphs throughout this report): Center for Applied Research and Environmental Systems (CARES) Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Office of Infectious Disease, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Office of Public Health Science Services, Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Laboratory Services, Division of Health Informatics and Surveillance (DHIS) Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Office of Public Health Science Services, National Center for Health Statist ics Community Commons Connecticut Department of Public Health ESRI ArcGIS Map Gallery National Cancer Institute, State Cancer Profiles OpenStreetMap (OSM) US Census Bureau, American Community Survey US Census Bureau, County Business Patterns US Census Bureau, Decennial Census US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service US Department of Health & Human Services US Department of Health & Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics Note that town- specific secondary data were sought and included where available; the remainder of secondary data indicators reflect county-level data for Hartford County. Benchmark Data Connecticut Risk Factor Data Statewide risk factor data are provided where available as an additional benchmark against which to compare local survey findings; these data are reported in the most recent BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) Preva lence and Trend Data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health & Human Services. State-level vital statistics are also provided for comparison of secondary data indicators. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 15 Nationwide Risk Factor Data Nationwide risk factor data, which are also provided in comparison charts, are taken from the 2013 PRC National Health Survey ; the methodological approach for the national study is identical to that employed in this assessment, and these data may be generalized to the US population with a high degree of confidence. National-level vital statistics are also provided for comparison of secondary data indicators. Healthy People 2020 Healthy People provides science-based, 10-year national objectives for improving the health of all Americans. The Healthy People initiative is grounded in the principle that setting national objectives and monitoring progress can motivate action. For three decades, Healthy People has established benchmarks and monitored progress over time in order to: Encourage collaborations across sectors. Guide individuals toward making informed health decisions. Measure the impact of prevention activities. Healthy People 2020 is the product of an extensive stakeholder feedback process that is unparalleled in government and health. It integrates input from public health and prevention experts, a wide range of federal, state and local government officials, a consortium of more than 2,000 organizations, and perhaps most importantly, the public. More than 8,000 comments were considered in drafting a comprehensive set of Healthy People 2020 objectives. Determining Significance Differences noted in this report represent those determined to be significant. For survey-derived indicators (which are subject to sampling error), statistical significance is determined based on confidence intervals (at the 95 percent confidence level) using question- specific samples and response rates. For secondary data indicators (which do not carry sampling error, but might be subject to reporting error), \"significance,\" for the purpose of this report, is determined by a 5% variation from the comparative measure. Information Gaps While this assessment is quite comprehensive, it cannot measure all possible aspects of health in the community, nor can it adequately represent all possible populations of interest. It must be recognized that these information gaps might in some ways limit the ability to assess all of the community's health needs. For example, certain population groups \u2014 such as the homeless, institutionalized persons, or those who only speak a language other than English or Spanish \u2014 are not represented in the survey data. Other population groups \u2014 for example, pregnant women, lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender residents, undocumented residents, and members of certain COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 16 racial/ethnic or immigrant groups \u2014 might not be identifiable or might not be represented in numbers sufficient for independent analyses. In terms of content, this assessment was designed to provide a comprehensive and broad picture of the health of the overall community. However, there are certainly a great number of medical conditions that are not specifically addressed.

We know that taking care of ourselves by eating well and staying active, not smoking, getting the recommended immunizations and screening tests, and seeing a doctor when we are sick all influence our health. Our health is also determined in part by access to social and economic opportunities; the resources and supports available in our homes, neighborhoods, and communities; the quality of our schooling; the safety of our workplaces; the cleanliness of our water, food, and air; and the nature of our social interactions and relationships. The conditions in which we live explain in part why some Americans are healthier than others and why Americans more generally are not as healthy as they could be.

COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 53 Activity Limitations About Disability & Health An individual can get a disabling impairment or chronic condition at any point in life. Compared with people without disabilities, people with disabilities are more likely to: Experience difficulties or delays in getting the health care they need. Not have had an annual dental visit. Not have had a mammogram in past 2 years. Not have had a Pap test within the past 3 years. Not engage in fitness activities. Use tobacco. Be overweight or obese. Have high blood pressure. Experience symptoms of psychological distress. Receive less social -emotional support. Have lower employment rates. There are many socia l and physical factors that influence the health of people with disabilities. The following three areas for public health action have been identified, using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) and the three World H ealth Organization (WHO) principles of action for addressing health determinants. Improve the conditions of daily life by: encouraging communities to be accessible so all can live in, move through, and interact with their environment; encouraging community living; and removing barriers in the environment using both physical universal design concepts and operational policy shifts. Address the inequitable distribution of resources among people with disabilities and those without disabilities by increasing: appropriate health care for people with disabilities; education and work opportunities; social participation; and access to needed technologies and assistive supports. Expand the knowledge base and raise awareness about determinants of health for people with disabilities by increasing: the inclusion of people with disabilities in public health data collection efforts across the lifespan; the inclusion of people with disabilities in health promotion activities; and the expansion of disability and health training opportunities for public health and health care professionals.

Mental health is essential to personal well -being, family and interpersonal relationships, and the ability to contrib ute to community or society. Mental disorders are health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, and/or behavior that are associated with distress and/or impaired functioning. Mental disorders contribute to a host of problems that may include disability, pain, or death. Mental illness is the term that refers collectively to all diagnosable mental disorders. Mental disorders are among the most common causes of disability. The resulting disease burden of mental illness is among the highest of all diseases. Mental health and physical health are closely connected. Mental health plays a major role in people's ability to maintain good physical health. Mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, affect people's ability to partic ipate in health -promoting behaviors. In turn, problems with physical health, such as chronic diseases, can have a serious impact on mental health and decrease a person's ability to participate in treatment and recovery. The existing model for understanding mental health and mental disorders emphasizes the interaction of social, environmental, and genetic factors throughout the lifespan. In behavioral health, researchers identify: risk factors , which predispose individuals to mental illness; and protective factors , which protect them from developing mental disorders. Researchers now know that the prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral (MEB) disorders is inherently interdisciplinary and draws on a variety of different strategies. Over the past 20 years, research on the prevention of mental disorders has progressed. The major areas of progress include evidence that: MEB disorders are common and begin early in life. The greatest opportunity for prevention is among young people. There are multiyear effects of multiple preventive interventions on reducing substance abuse, conduct disorder, antisocial behavior, aggression, and child maltreatment. The incidence of depression among pregnant women and adolescents can be reduced. School -based violence prevention can reduce the base rate of aggressive problems in an average school by 25 to 33%. There are potential indicated preventive interventions for schizophrenia. Improving family functioning and positive parenting can have positive outcomes on mental health and can reduce poverty -related risk. School -based preventive interventions aimed at improving social and emotional outcomes can also improve academic outcomes. Interventions targeting families dealing with adversities, such as parental depression or divor ce, can be effective in reducing risk for depression in children and increasing effective parenting. Some preventive interventions have benefits that exceed costs, with the available evidence strongest for early childhood interventions.

Continued long term follow up and transitions of care with chronic disease and mental illness. Limited providers equipped to meet the needs of those with mental illness. Varied approaches to screening for mental illness, including depression, anxiety and their co -existence in chronic disease. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Accessing affordable services. Accessing mental health providers who understand the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. - Social Services Representative Access. When it comes to treatment of mental health, we look at the problem as if it was a short -term one. Insurance plans may cover four outpatient visits, use of medications as a quick fix, not allowing for mid or long term follow -up. Children and Youth have limited access to inpatient services, residential services, etc. Problems encountered in schools are not often dealt with properly due to limited resour ces. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Identification and access. - Community/Business Leader Access to timely quality care and substance abuse treatment resources. - Social Services Representative People with commercial or private insurance often have d ifficulty accessing participating providers or those who participate have limited capacity. Also, despite parity, benefits are often limited - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Lack of Services There is limited community resources. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Mental Health Services is a much needed service in my community. The waiting list is long in some areas and people are having a multitude if mental health issues that are not being addressed on time. - Social Services Representative Inadequate resources, housing is often a challenge. Family education and support. - Community/Business Leader Lack of access to care, especially pediatric services and what is then covered tied to this care. Day programs are almost always uncovered and almost always the most needed for children. - Physician In addition to the stigma that is still associated with mental health and addiction issues, there are insufficient services and funding for services to meet the need, especially for children and adolescents. - Community/Business Leader Stigma Stigma, lack of resources. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Stigma. Lack of access to therapy and medical treatment. Cultural barriers to seeking mental help. Criminalizing the mentally ill. - Public Health Expert Residential Homes Approximately 60 State of CT managed Group Home, like residential homes are located in Manchester. Some serve individuals released from Prison for transition through a probation period. Other homes are identified for troubled youth, substance abuse, and a wide variety of behavioral health issues. Access to mental health care is provided to a large extent through services located in Manchester. However, there is a tipping point with the number of individuals being moved to reside in Mancheste r and the capacity to serve them in the medical community. - Public Health Expert Access to residential and primary care specialists. - Community/Business Leader Co-Occurrence With Other Issues Suicide, depression, alcohol and other substance abuse. - Phys ician Many patients have social issues as well as BH issues along with their treating medical chronic condition. Many have substance abuse contributing to their need for BH services. Many are uninsured. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 70 At-Risk Populations Stress and depression are major and disproportionate mental health problems among Latinos, among others. Lack of bilingual mental health professionals is major deficit in the service system. - Social Services Representative We are seeing increasing numbers of students with mental health and behavioral issues. - Community/Business Leader Studies/Assessment Findings Studies/assessments have determined that to be the case. - Community/Business Leader Case Management and Employment Access to case management and employment. - Social Services Representative Significantly Under Detected If people are not well mentally they will develop other issues and will potentially hurt others if not treated. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Death, Disease & Chronic Conditions COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 72 Characteristics of Deaths Deaths by Race & Ethnicity The following graph illustrates the distribution of deaths by race in select Hartford Region towns.

Furthermore, in order to compare localities without undue bias toward younger or older populations, the common convention is to adjust the data to some common baseline age distribution. Use of these \"age -adjusted\" rates provides the most valuable means of gauging mortality against benchmark data, as well as Healthy People 2020 targets. The following chart outlines 2011- 2013 annual average age-adjusted death rates per 100,000 population for selected causes of death in Hartford County . Note that age-adjusted mortality rates in Hartford County are worse than national rates for kidney diseases and HIV/AIDS (similar to or better than the US for all others shown).

Together, heart disease and stroke are among the most widespread and costly health problems facing the nation today, accounting for more than $500 billion in healthcare expenditures and related expenses in 2010 alone. Fortunately, they are also among the most preventable. The leading modifiable (controllable) risk factors for heart disease and stroke are: High blood pressure High cholesterol Cigarette smoking Diabetes Poor diet and physical inactivity Overweight and obesity The risk of Americans developing and dying from cardiovascular disease would be substantially reduced if major improvements were made across the US population in diet and physical activity, control of high blood pressure and cholesterol, smoking cessation, and appropriate aspirin use. The burden of cardiovascular disease is disproportionately distributed across the population. There are significant disparities in the following based on gender, age, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and socioeconomic status: Prevalence of risk factors Access to treatment Appropriate a nd timely treatment Treatment outcomes Mortality Disease does not occur in isolation, and cardiovascular disease is no exception. Cardiovascular health is significantly influenced by the physical, social, and political environment, including: maternal and child health; access to educational opportunities; availability of healthy foods, physical education, and extracurricular activities in schools; opportunities for physical activity, including access to safe and walkable communities; access to healthy foods; quality of working conditions and worksite health; availability of community support and resources; and access to affordable, quality healthcare.

People who are overweight have a higher risk for cardiovascular disease. Almost 60% of adults are overweight or obese. To maintain a proper body weight, experts recommend a well -balanced diet which is low in fat and high in fiber, accompanied by regular exercise. Lack of physical activity . People who are not physically active have twice the risk for heart disease of those who are active. More than half of adults do not achieve recommended levels of physical activ ity. Tobacco use . Smokers have twice the risk for heart attack of nonsmokers. Nearly one -fifth of all deaths from cardiovascular disease, or about 190,000 deaths a year nationally, are smoking -related. Every day, more than 3,000 young people become daily s mokers in the US Modifying these behaviors is critical both for preventing and for controlling cardiovascular disease. Other steps that adults who have cardiovascular disease should take to reduce their risk of death and disability include adhering to trea tment for high blood pressure and cholesterol, using aspirin as appropriate, and learning the symptoms of heart attack and stroke. National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Total Cardiovascular Risk A total of 83.6% of Hartford Region adults report one or more cardiovascular risk factors, such as being overweight, smoking cigarettes, being physically inactive, or having high blood pressure or cholesterol.

Notes: Asked of all respondents.46.2% 30.8% 17.9% 5.1%Major Problem Moderate Problem Minor Problem No Problem At All Top Concerns Among those rating this issue as a \"major problem,\" reasons fr equently related to the following: Leading Cause of Death, Prevalence Continues to be in the top five houses of death in our city. - Public Health Expert Data show. - Physician Can lead to death and other life -threatening and expensive to treat illnesses. - Health Provider (Non - Physician) Heart disease is the leading cause of death among minorities in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health. Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to suffer from obesity and hypertension, two of the major risk factors for heart disease. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Lead cause of death. - Public Health Expert Studies/assessments have determined that to be the case. - Community/Business Leader Nutrition, Phy sical Activity & Weight Bad habits of today, that offer immediate gratification, leads to these health risks down the road. Stress, poor diets, lack of exercise (no time) are all becoming more a part of our lives. Primary Care can address some challenges w hen people have coverage and can make their co -payments, but our society has become more \"give me what I want now, I'll deal with the consequences later.\" While school meals seem to be improving for our children, the pressure to improve testing scores has led to the elimination of recess and cut down on physical education/activity in many school systems, another example of what we deem to be our priority. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Poor diet and exercise. Lack of education. Poor parks and recreation options. Poor urban planning, community infrastructure, barrier to physical activity. Food, desserts. - Public Health Expert There is a high prevalence of obesity in Hartford which is linked to heart disease. Further there are a number of barriers to accessing nutritious food which make it difficult for families to eat regular balanced nutritious meals. - Community/Business Leader High- stress lifestyles, lack of exercise, lack of access to and affordability of healthy foods, heavy smoking and consuming alcoholic beverages in excess. - Social Services Representative Poverty, inadequate diets, not taking the problem serious. - Social Services Representative At-Risk Populations African Americans and Hispanics which make up a large percentage of the Hartford population are often affected by heart disease and stroke. Reasons being due to genetics, but largely because of a COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 94 poor unbalanced diet which contains a vast amount carbohydrates, fats and sodium and not enough grains, fruits and vegetables. - Health Pro vider (Non -Physician) With the high rates of diabetes in the city, the risk for heart disease and stroke is also elevated. - Community/Business Leader Heart disease and stroke in the community are usual as result of another chronic disease not being managed. - Social Services Representative Individuals who cannot afford care often go untreated with progression of disease states. Limited ability to refer patients to cardiology related to uninsured status. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 95 Cancer About Cancer Continued advances in cancer research, detection, and treatment have resulted in a decline in both incidence and death rates for all cancers. Among people who develop cancer, more than half will be alive in five years. Yet, cancer remains a leading cause of death in the United States, second only to heart disease. Many cancers are preventable by reducing risk factors such as: use of tobacco products; physical inactivity and poor nutrition; obesity; and ultraviolet light exposure. Other cancers can be prevented by getting vaccinated against human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus. In the past decade, overweight and obesity have emerged as new risk factors for developing certain cancers, including colorectal, breast, uterine corpus (endometrial), a nd kidney cancers. The impact of the current weight trends on cancer incidence will not be fully known for several decades. Continued focus on preventing weight gain will lead to lower rates of cancer and many chronic diseases. Screening is effective in id entifying some types of cancers (see US Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF] recommendations), including: Breast cancer (using mammography) Cervical cancer (using Pap tests) Colorectal cancer (using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonosc opy) Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Cancer Deaths Age-Adjusted Cancer Deaths Between 2011 and 2013, there was an annual average age-adjusted cancer mortality rate of 155.0 deaths per 100,000 population in Hartford County .

All cancers caused by cigarette smokin g could be prevented. At least one -third of cancer deaths that occur in the United States are due to cigarette smoking. According to the American Cancer Society, about one -third of cancer deaths that occur in the United States each year are due to nutrition and physical activity factors, including obesity. National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Cancer Screenings The American Cancer Society recommends that both men and women get a cancer-related checkup during a regular doctor's checkup. It should include examination for cancers of the thyroid, testicles, ovaries, lymph nodes, oral cavity, and skin, as well as health counseling about tobacco, sun exposure, diet and nutrition, risk fac tors, sexual practices, and environmental and occupational exposures. Screening levels in the community were measured in the PRC Community Health Survey relative to three cancer sites: female breast cancer (mammography); cervical cancer (Pap smear testing); and colorectal cancer (sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood testing). RELATED ISSUE: See also Nutrition & Overweight , Physical Activity & Fitness and Tobacco Use in the Modifiable Health Risk section of this report. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 103 Female Breast Cancer Screening About Screening for Breast Cancer The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening mammography, with or without clinical breast examination (CBE), every 1 -2 years for women age 40 and older. Rationale: The USPSTF found fair evidence that mammography screening every 12 -33 months significantly reduces mortality from breast cancer. Evidence is strongest for women age 50 -69, the age group generally included in screening trials. For women age 40 -49, the evidence that screening mammography reduces mortality from breast cancer is weaker, and the absolute benefit of mammography is smaller, than it is for older women. Most, but not all, studies indicate a mortality benefit for women undergoing mammography at ages 40 -49, but the delay in observed benefit in women younger than 50 makes it difficult to determine the incremental benefit of beginning screening at age 40 rather than at age 50. The absolute benefit is smaller because the incidence of breast cancer is lower among women in their 40s than it is among older women. The USPSTF concluded that the evidence is also generalizable to women age 70 and older (who face a higher absolute risk for breast cancer) if their life expectancy is not compromised by comorbid disease. The absolute probability of benefits of regular mammography increase along a continuum with age, whereas the likelihood of harms from screening (false -positive results and unnecessary anxiety, biopsies, and cost) diminish from ages 40 -70. The balance of benefits and potential harms, therefore, grows more favorable as women age. The precise age at which the potential benefits of mammography justify the possible harms is a subjective c hoice. The USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence to specify the optimal screening interval for women age 40 -49. US Preventive Services Task Force, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of Health & Human Services Note that other organizations (e.g., American Cancer Society, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Physicians, National Cancer Institute) may have slightly different screening guidelines. Mammography Among women age 50- 74, 85.8 % have had a mammogram within the past two years. Better than statewide findings (which represent all women 50+). Similar to national findings. Satisfies the Healthy People 2020 target (81.1% or higher). Among women 40+, 82.1% have had a mammogram in the past two years.

Rationale: The USPSTF found good evidence from multiple observational studies that screening with cervical cytology (Pap smears) reduces incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer. Direct evid ence to determine the optimal starting and stopping age and interval for screening is limited. Indirect evidence suggests most of the benefit can be obtained by beginning screening within 3 years of onset of sexual activity or age 21 (whichever comes first) and screening at least every 3 years. The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening substantially outweigh potential harms. The USPSTF recommends against routinely screening women older than age 65 for cervical cancer if they have had adequate recent screening with normal Pap smears and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer. Rationale: The USPSTF found limited evidence to determine the benefits of continued screening in women older than 65. The yield of screening is low in previously s creened women older than 65 due to the declining incidence of high -grade cervical lesions after middle age. There is fair evidence that screening women older than 65 is associated with an increased risk for potential harms, including false - positive results and invasive procedures. The USPSTF concludes that the potential harms of screening are likely to exceed benefits among older women who have had normal results previously and who are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer. The USPSTF recommends against routine Pap smear screening in women who have had a total hysterectomy for benign disease. Rationale: The USPSTF found fair evidence that the yield of cytologic screening is very low in women after hysterectomy and poor evidence that screening to detect vaginal cancer improves health outcomes. The USPSTF concludes that potential harms of continued screening after hysterectomy are likely to exceed benefits. US Preventive Services Task Force, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of Health & Human Services Note that other organizations (e.g., American Cancer Society, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Phys icians, National Cancer Institute) may have slightly different screening guidelines.

The evidence is convincing that screening for colorectal cancer with fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy detects early -stage cancer and adenomatous polyps. There is convincing evidence that screening with any of the three recommended tests (FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy) reduces colorectal cancer mortality in adults age 50 to 75 years. Follow -up of positive screening test results requires colonoscopy regardless of the screening test used. US Preventive Services Task Force, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of Health & Human Services Note that other organizations (e.g., American Cancer Society, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Physicians, National Cancer Institute) may have slightly different screening guidelines.

Specific methods of detection, intervention, and treatment exist that may reduce this burden and promote health. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by episodes of reversible breathing problems due to airway narrowing and obstruction. These episodes can range in severity from mild to life threatening. Symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Daily preventive treatment can prevent symptoms and attacks and enable individuals who have asthma to lead active lives. COPD is a preventable and treatable disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases (typically from exposure to cigarett e smoke). Treatment can lessen symptoms and improve quality of life for those with COPD. The burden of respiratory diseases affects individuals and their families, schools, workplaces, neighborhoods, cities, and states. Because of the cost to the healthcare system, the burden of respiratory diseases also falls on society; it is paid for with higher health insurance rates, lost productivity, and tax dollars. Annual healthcare expenditures for asthma alone are estimated at $20.7 billion. Asthma . The prevalence of asthma has increased since 1980. However, deaths from asthma have decreased since the mid -1990s. The causes of asthma are an active area of research and involve both genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors for asthma currently being investigated include: Having a parent with asthma Sensitization to irritants and allergens Respiratory infections in childhood Overweight Asthma affects people of every race, sex, and age. However, significant disparities in asthma morbidity and mortality exist, in particular for low -income and minority populations. Populations with higher rates of asthma include: children; women (among adults) and boys (among children); African Americans; Puerto Ricans; people living in the Northeast United States; people living below the Federal poverty level; and employees with certain exposures in the workplace. While there is not a cure for asthma yet, there are diagnoses and treatment guidelines that are aimed at ensuring that all people with asthma live full and active live s.

Both unintentional injuries and those caused by acts of violence are among the top 15 killers for Americans of all ages. Many people accept them as \"accidents,\" \"acts of fate,\" or as \"part of life.\" However, most events resulting in injury, disability, or death are predictable and preventable. Injuries are the leading caus e of death for Americans ages 1 to 44, and a leading cause of disability for all ages, regardless of sex, race/ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. More than 180,000 people die from injuries each year, and approximately 1 in 10 sustains a nonfatal injury serious enough to be treated in a hospital emergency department. Beyond their immediate health consequences, injuries and violence have a significant impact on the well-being of Americans by contributing to: Premature death Disability Poor mental health High medical costs Lost productivity The effects of injuries and violence extend beyond the injured person or victim of violence to family members, friends, coworkers, employers, and communities. Numerous factors can affect the risk of unintentional injury a nd violence, including individual behaviors, physical environment, access to health services (ranging from pre -hospital and acute care to rehabilitation), and social environment (from parental monitoring and supervision of youth to peer group associations, neighborhoods, and communities). Interventions addressing these social and physical factors have the potential to prevent unintentional injuries and violence. Efforts to prevent unintentional injury may focus on: Modifications of the environment Improveme nts in product safety Legislation and enforcement Education and behavior change Technology and engineering Efforts to prevent violence may focus on: Changing social norms about the acceptability of violence Improving problem -solving skills (for example, pa renting, conflict resolution, coping) Changing policies to address the social and economic conditions that often give rise to violence Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Leading Causes of Accidental Death Poisoning (which includes unintentional drug overdoses) was the leading cause of accidental deaths in Hartford County from 2011 to 2013.

Notes: This indicator reports the rate of violent crime offenses reported by the sheriff's office or county police department per 10 0,000 residents. Violent crime includes homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. This indicator is relevant because it assesses community safety. Participation by law enforcement agencies in the UCR program is voluntary. Sub -state data do not necessarily represent an exhau stive list of crimes due to gaps in reporting. Also, some institutions of higher education have their own police departments, which handle offenses occurring within campus grounds; these offenses are not included in the violent crime statistics, but can be obtained from the Uniform Crime Reports Universities and Colleges data tables. 323.2 280.6395.5 Hartford County CT US050100150200250300350400450 Self-Reported Violence A total of 2.9% of Hartford Region adults ac knowledge being the victim of a violent crime in the past five years.

Perceptions of Injury and Violence as a Problem in the Community (Key Informants, 2015) Sources: PRC Online Key Informant Survey, Professional Research Consultants, Inc. Notes: Asked of all respondents.52.3% 25.0% 15.9% 6.8%Major Problem Moderate Problem Minor Problem No Problem At All Top Concerns Among those rating this issue as a \"major problem,\" reasons frequently related to the following: Gang Activity & Youth Violence Every day there are people in my community either getting killed or injured due to guns, gang relat ed matters, drug problems, etc. - Social Services Representative We have a lot of gang activity. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) There is a high prevalence of community violence and gang involvement in Hartford. Many young people are negatively influenced by peers and end up in unsafe situations. Many residents do not feel safe because of the violence and research has demonstrated the impact of high levels of community violence on child development and the stress that it creates which is can impact soci al/emotional development and wellbeing. - Community/Business Leader Our students are affected by high rates of violence in our community. - Community/Business Leader Environment & Economic Stressors Hartford is an urban center with a significantly economic ally stressed population. Injury and violence statistics vary by neighborhood, but are above state averages. - Community/Business Leader Poverty, people have many daily issues and they used substances, have little hope and are frustrated with their life and then resort to utilizing poor skills. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) I believe that there is more harm done to children through intentional or unintentional injury than any childhood illness. The long term effects of being exposed to violence at an early age is not something we measure, but impacts our health system, educational system and judicial system. Access to weapons is a problem when mixed with stress, poverty, etc. Many unintentional injuries are easily preventable, but a hurried lifestyle along with \"it won't happen to me\" attitude are bad combinations. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Unsafe housing conditions. Lack of safe play spaces. Young parents with lack of parenting skills, abuse and neglect. - Public Health Expert Domestic Vi olence Domestic violence is an ongoing issue and more needs to be done tied to helping physicians and other clinicians identify and then help direct patients who have been a victim of domestic violence. There is also a need for interpreter services tied t o communicating with those often who have been abused. - Physician Domestic violence and youth violence. - Community/Business Leader Many of these are preventable, so you would expect to see this decreasing as knowledge is COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 138 disseminated. Instead we see fami ly violence and unintentional injuries repeated generation after generation. - Social Services Representative Prevalence of Violence Homicide and other intentional injury. Alcohol -related injury. - Physician Studies/assessments have determined that to be the case. - Community/Business Leader Homelessness The community I am referring to is those experiencing or at risk of homelessness. For women and families, domestic violence is often related to episodes of homelessness. Also, for those experiencing homel essness, the threat of injury and violence is a significant issue. - Community/Business Leader COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 139 Diabetes About Diabetes Diabetes mellitus occurs when the body cannot produce or respond appropriately to insulin. Insulin is a hormone that the body needs to a bsorb and use glucose (sugar) as fuel for the body's cells. Without a properly functioning insulin signaling system, blood glucose levels become elevated and other metabolic abnormalities occur, leading to the development of serious, disabling complications. Many forms of diabetes exist; the three common types are Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes. Effective therapy can prevent or delay diabetic complications. Diabetes mellitus: Lowers life expectancy by up to 15 years. Increases the risk of heart disease by 2 to 4 times. Is the leading cause of kidney failure, lower limb amputations, and adult -onset blindness. The rate of diabetes mellitus continues to increase both in the United States and throughout the world. Due to the steady rise in the number of persons with diabetes mellitus, and possibly earlier onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus, there is growing concern about the possibility that the increase in the number of persons with diabetes mellitus and the complexity of their care might overwhelm existing healthcare systems. People from minority populations are more frequently affected by type 2 diabetes. Minority groups constitute 25% of all adult patients with diabetes in the US and represent the majority of children and adolescents with type 2 di abetes. Lifestyle change has been proven effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes in high - risk individuals.

It is not just about education my community on what to eat and so on, but it is also about educating the community on how certain foods will affect diabetes and what are the best approaches. Adherence to meds is another factor, if a patient truly understands what these meds are for, side effects, etc. They will make better informed decisions. - Social Services Representative Latinos have higher diabetes incidence and more complications and mortality due to diabetes. A randomized controlled trial conducted by Hartford Hosp., Yale Univ. and HHC provided in -home peer counseling to Latinos patients of HH with diabetes. Findings included: a) this intensive service model, 17 home visits in one year decreased the HbA1 (b) down one full point compared to .4 in the control group, and the difference was sustained six months post -intervention and c) gaps in care, care coordination and cultural competence identified by the hospital's clinical team that partnered in the study - inclu ding the need for in -hospital care coordination and cultural competence training.

Dementia is not a disease itself, but rather a set of symptoms. Memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, although memory loss by itself does not mean a person has dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for the majority of all diagnosed cases. Alzheimer's disease is the 6 th leading cause of death among adults age 18 years and older. Estimates vary, but experts suggest that up to 5.1 million Americans age 65 years and older have Alzheimer's disease. These numbers are predicted to more than double by 2050 unless more effective ways to treat and p revent Alzheimer's disease are found. Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Age-Adjusted Alzheimer's Disease Deaths Between 2011 and 2013, there was an annual average age- adjusted Alzheimer's disease mortality rate of 17.4 deaths per 100,000 population in Hartford County .

They are responsible for premature death and exact a high economic price from both the private and public sectors. Nearly 25% of the Medicare budget is used to treat people with chronic kidney disease and end -stage renal disease. Genetic determinants have a large influence on the development and progression of chronic kidney disease. It is not possible to alte r a person's biology and genetic determinants; however, environmental influences and individual behaviors also have a significant influence on the development and progression of chronic kidney disease. As a result, some populations are disproportionately a ffected. Successful behavior modification is expected to have a positive influence on the disease. Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure. The results of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) funded by the national Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) show that moderate exercise, a healthier diet, and weight reduction can prevent development of type 2 diabetes in persons at risk.

This is due to the lack of proper diet, medical management of hypertension and diabetes, all of which are greatly suffered by members of this community as well. - Health Prov ider (Non -Physician) African Americans are three times more likely to experience kidney failure than whites. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Prevalence of Kidney Disease Studies/assessments have determined that to be the case. - Community/Business Lead er Lack of Nephrologists There are very few actively clinically practicing nephrologists in Connecticut that are not tied to academic medical centers, it makes access to ESRD care very trying for patients in the outlying areas. - Physician COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 155 Potentially Di sabling Conditions About Arthritis, Osteoporosis & Chronic Back Conditions There are more than 100 types of arthritis. Arthritis commonly occurs with other chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Interventions to treat the pain an d reduce the functional limitations from arthritis are important, and may also enable people with these other chronic conditions to be more physically active. Arthritis affects 1 in 5 adults and continues to be the most common cause of disability. It co sts more than $128 billion per year. All of the human and economic costs are projected to increase over time as the population ages. There are interventions that can reduce arthritis pain and functional limitations, but they remain underused. These includ e: increased physical activity; self - management education; and weight loss among overweight/obese adults. Osteoporosis is a disease marked by reduced bone strength leading to an increased risk of fractures (broken bones). In the United States, an estimated 5.3 million people age 50 years and older have osteoporosis. Most of these people are women, but about 0.8 million are men. Just over 34 million more people, including 12 million men, have low bone mass, which puts them at increased risk for developing osteoporosis. Half of all women and as many as 1 in 4 men age 50 years and older will have an osteoporosis -related fracture in their lifetime. Chronic back pain is common, costly, and potentially disabling. About 80% of Americans experience low back pain in their lifetime. It is estimated that each year: 15%- 20% of the population develop protracted back pain. 2-8% have chronic back pain (pain that lasts more than 3 months). 3-4% of the population is temporarily disabled due to back pain. 1% of the working -age population is disabled completely and permanently as a result of low back pain. Americans spend at least $50 billion each year on low back pain. Low back pain is the: 2nd leading cause of lost work time (after the common cold). 3rd most common reason to undergo a surgical procedure. 5th most frequent cause of hospitalization. Arthritis, osteoporosis, and chronic back conditions all have major effects on quality of life, the ability to work, and basic activities of daily living.

Also, there are fewer clinically practicing orthopedists who are not hospital employed and who have available office hours. - Physician Vision & Hearing Impairment About Vision Vision is an essential part of everyday life, influencing how Americans of all ages learn, communicate, work, play, and interact with the world. Yet millions of Americans live with visual impairment, and many more remain at risk for eye disease and preventable eye injury. The eyes are an important, but often overlooked, part of overall health. Despite the preventable nature of some vision impairments, many people do not receive recommended screenings and exams. A visit to an eye care professional for a comprehensive dilated eye exam can help to detect common vision problems and eye diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, and age -related macular degeneration. These common vision problems often have no early warning signs. If a problem is detected, an eye care professional can prescribe corrective eyewear, medicine, or surgery to minimize vision loss and help a person see his or her best. Healthy vision can help to ensure a healthy and active lifestyle well into a person's later years. Educating and engaging families, communities, and the nation is critical to ensuring that people have the information, resources, and tools needed for good eye health.

COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 159 Hearing Trouble About Hearing & Other Sensory or Communication Disorders An impaired ability to communicate with others or maintain good balance can lead many people to feel socially isolated, have unmet health needs, have limited success in school or on the job. Communication and other sensory processes contribute to our overall health and well -being. Protecting these pro cesses is critical, particularly for people whose age, race, ethnicity, gender, occupation, genetic background, or health status places them at increased risk. Many factors influence the numbers of Americans who are diagnosed and treated for hearing and o ther sensory or communication disorders, such a social determinants (social and economic standings, age of diagnosis, cost and stigma of wearing a hearing aid, and unhealthy lifestyle choices). In addition, biological causes of hearing loss and other sensory or communication disorders include: genetics; viral or bacterial infections; sensitivity to certain drugs or medications; injury; and aging. As the nation's population ages and survival rates for medically fragile infants and for people with severe injuries and acquired diseases improve, the prevalence of sensory and communication disorders is expected to rise.

An estimated 1.1 million Americans are living with HIV, and 1 in 5 people with HIV do not know they have it. HIV continues to spread, leading to about 56,000 new HIV infections each year. HIV is a preventable disease, and effective HIV prevention interventions have been proven to reduce HIV transmission. People who get tested for HIV and learn that they are infected can make significant behavior changes to improve their health and reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to their sex or drug - using partners. More than 50% of new HIV infections occur as a result of the 21% of people who have HIV but do not know it. In the era of increasingly effective treatments for HIV, people with HIV are living longer, healthier, and more productive lives. Deaths from HIV infection have greatly declined in the United States since the 1990s. As the number of people living with HIV grows, it will be more important than ever to increase national HIV prevention and healthcare programs. There are gender, race, and ethnicity disparities in new HIV infections: Nearly 75% of new HIV infections occur in men. More than half occur in gay and bisexual men, regardless of race or ethnicity. 45% of new HIV infections occur in African Americans, 35% in whites, and 17% in Hispanics. Improving access to quality healthcare for populations disproportionately affected by HIV, such as persons of color and gay and bisexual men, is a fundamental public health strategy for HIV prevention. People getting care for HIV can receive: Antiretroviral therapy Screening and treatment for other diseases (such as sexually transmitted infections) HIV prevention interventions Mental health services Other health services As the number of people living with HIV increases and more people become aware of their HIV status, prevention strategies that are targeted specifically for HIV -infected people are becoming more important. Prevention work with people living with HIV focuses on: Linking to and staying in treatment. Increasing the availability of ongoing HIV prevention interventions. Providing prevention services for their partners. Public perception in the US about the seriousness of the HIV epidemic has declined in recent years. There is evidence that risky behaviors may be increasing among uninfected people, especially gay and bisexual men. Ongoing media and social campaigns for the general public and HIV prevention interventio ns for uninfected persons who engage in risky behaviors are critical.

There is not enough prevention education. - Social Services Representative There are growing case of HIV/AIDS in women of color and the senior population. This is due a number of reasons but mostly lack of education and reinforce knowledge of sexual. HIV/AIDS is result of not practicing safe sex. - Social Services Representative As an HIV/AIDS organization, we are still engaging and diagnosing new cases. People are still thinking that it is not a major problem, but our young Latino and African American community is coming back infected. - Social Services Representative While HIV/AIDS incidence overall has declined, it affects Latino communities disproportionately, COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 176 especially in the northeast/Connecticut. Latinos are more likely to be tested after the infection has progressed beyond the early stages of the disease. - Social Services Representative Studies/assessments have determined that to be the case, particularly among the black community. - Community/Business Leader Substance Abuse HIV/AIDS ties directly in with substance abuse which is also a major problem in the Hartford area. Promiscuous activity and unprotected sex. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) High drug use. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Lack of education. High substance abuse rates, risky behaviors. - Public Health Expert Prevalence of HIV/AIDS There is a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Hartford compared to other CT communities.

Despite their burdens, costs, and complications, and the fact that they are largely preventable, STDs remain a significan t public health problem in the United States. This problem is largely unrecognized by the public, policymakers, and health care professionals. STDs cause many harmful, often irreversible, and costly clinical complications, such as: reproductive health problems; fetal and perinatal health problems; cancer; and facilitation of the sexual transmission of HIV infection. Because many cases of STDs go undiagnosed \u2014and some common viral infections, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and genital herpes, are not reported to CDC at all \u2014the reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis represent only a fraction of the true burden of STDs in the US. Untreated STDs can lead to serious long -term health consequences, especially for adolescent girls and young women. Several factors contribute to the spread of STDs. Biological Factors. STDs are acquired during unprotected sex with an infected partner. Biological factors that affect the spread of STDs include: Asymptomatic nature of STDs . The majority of STDs either do not produce any symptoms or signs, or they produce symptoms so mild that they are unnoticed; consequently, many infected persons do not know that they need medical care. Gender disparities . Women suffer more frequent and more serious STD complications t han men do. Among the most serious STD complications are pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside of the uterus), infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. Age disparities . Compared to older adults, sexually active adolescents ages 15 to 19 and young adults ages 20 to 24 are at higher risk for getting STDs. Lag time between infection and complications . Often, a long interval, sometimes years, occurs between acquiring an STD and recognizing a clinically significant health problem. Soci al, Economic and Behavioral Factors. The spread of STDs is directly affected by social, economic, and behavioral factors. Such factors may cause serious obstacles to STD prevention due to their influence on social and sexual networks, access to and provis ion of care, willingness to seek care, and social norms regarding sex and sexuality. Among certain vulnerable populations, historical experience with segregation and discrimination exacerbates these factors. Social, economic, and behavioral factors that af fect the spread of STDs include: racial and ethnic disparities; poverty and marginalization; access to healthcare; substance abuse; sexuality and secrecy (stigma and discomfort discussing sex); and sexual networks (persons \"linked\" by sequential or concurr ent sexual partners ). Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Chlamydia & Gonorrhea In 2012 , the chlamydia incidence rate in Hartford County was 447.2 cases per 100,000 population . Notably higher than the Connecticut incidence rate. Similar to the national incidence rate. The gonorrhea incidence rate in Harford County was 75.9 cases per 100,000 population in 2012 .

Their well- being determines the health of the next generation and can help predict future public health challenges for families, communities, and the healthcare system. The risk of maternal and infant mortality and pregnancy -related complications can be reduced by increasing access to quality preconception (before pregnancy) and inter -conception (between pregnancies) care. Moreover, healthy birth outcomes and early identification and treatment of health conditions among infants can prevent death or disability and enable children to reach their full potential. Many factors can affect pregnancy and childbirth, including pre -conception health status, age, access to appropriate healthcare, and poverty. Infant and child health are similarly influenced by socio -demographic factors, such as family income, but are also linked to the physical and mental health of parents and caregivers. There are racial and ethnic disparities in mortality and morbidity for mothers and children, particularly for African Americans. These differences are likely the result of ma ny factors, including social determinants (such as racial and ethnic disparities in infant mortality; family income; educational attainment among household members; and health insurance coverage) and physical determinants (i.e., the health, nutrition, and behaviors of the mother during pregnancy and early childhood).

Teen mothers: Are less likely to graduate from high school or attain a GED by the time they reach age 30. Earn an average of approximately $3,500 less per year, when compared with those who delay childbearing. Receive nearly twice as much Federal aid for nearly twice as long. Similarly, early fatherhood is associated with lower educational attainment and lower income. Children of teen parents are more likely to have lower cognitive attainment and exhibit more behavior problems. Sons of teen mothers are more likely to be incarcerated, and daughters are more likely to become adolescent mothers.

This study found that behavior patterns represent the single -most prominent domain of influence over health prospects in the United States. The daily choices we make with respect to diet, physical activity, and sex; the substance abuse and addict ions to which we fall prey; our approach to safety; and our coping strategies in confronting stress are all important determinants of health. The most prominent contributors to mortality in the United States in 2000 were tobacco (an estimated 435,000 deat hs), diet and activity patterns (400,000), alcohol (85,000), microbial agents (75,000), toxic agents (55,000), motor vehicles (43,000), firearms (29,000), sexual behavior (20,000), and illicit use of drugs (17,000). Socioeconomic status and access to medical care are also important contributors, but difficult to quantify independent of the other factors cited. Because the studies reviewed used different approaches to derive estimates, the stated numbers should be viewed as first approximations. These analyses show that smoking remains the leading cause of mortality. However, poor diet and physical inactivity may soon overtake tobacco as the leading cause of death. These findings, along with escalating healthcare costs and aging population, argue persuasively that the need to establish a more preventive orientation in the US healthcare and public health systems has become more urgent.

COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 206 Nutrition About Healthful Diet & Healthy Weight Strong science exists supporting the health benefits of eating a healthful diet and maintaining a healthy body weight. Efforts to change diet and weight should address individual behaviors, as well as the policies and environments that support these behaviors in settings such as schools, worksites, healthcare organizations, and communities. The goal of promoting healthful diets and healthy weight encompasses increasing household food security and eliminating hunger. Americans with a healthful diet: Consume a variety of nutrient -dense foods within and across the food groups, especially whole grains, fruits, veg etables, low -fat or fat -free milk or milk products, and lean meats and other protein sources. Limit the intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, added sugars, sodium (salt), and alcohol. Limit caloric intake to meet caloric needs. Diet and body weight are related to health status. Good nutrition is important to the growth and development of children. A healthful diet also helps Americans reduce their risks for many health conditions, including: overweight and obesity; malnutrition; iron -deficiency constipation; diverticular disease; and some cancers. Diet reflects the variety of foods and beverages consumed over time and in se ttings such as worksites, schools, restaurants, and the home. Interventions to support a healthier diet can help ensure that: Individuals have the knowledge and skills to make healthier choices. Healthier options are available and affordable. Social Determinants of Diet. Demographic characteristics of those with a more healthful diet vary with the nutrient or food studied. However, most Americans need to improve some aspect of their diet. Social factors thought to influence diet include: Knowledge and at titudes Skills Social support Societal and cultural norms Food and agricultural policies Food assistance programs Economic price systems Physical Determinants of Diet. Access to and availability of healthier foods can help people follow healthful diets. For example, better access to retail venues that sell healthier options may have a positive impact on a person's diet; these venues may be less available in low -income or rural neighborhoods. The places where people eat appear to influence their diet. For example, foods eaten away from home often have more calories and are of lower nutritional quality than foods prepared at home. Marketing also influences people's \u2014particularly children's \u2014food choices.

Among adults and older adults, physical activity can lower the risk of: early death; coronary heart disease; stroke; high blood pressure; type 2 diabetes; breast and colon cancer; falls; and depression. Among children and adolescents, physical activity can: improve bone health; improve cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness; decrease levels of body fat; and reduce symptoms of depression. For people who are inactive, even small increases in physical activity are associated with health benefits. Personal, social, economic, and environmental factors all play a role in physical activity levels among youth, adults, and older adults. Understanding the barriers to and facilitators of physical activity is important to ensure the effectiveness of interventions and other actions to improve levels of physical activity. Factors positively associated with adult physical activity include: postsecondary education; higher income; enjoyment of exercise; expectation of benefits; belief in ability to exercise (self -efficacy); history of activity in adulthood; social support from peers, family, or spouse; access to and satisfaction with facilities; enjoyable scenery; and safe neighborhoods. Factors negatively associated with adult physical activity include: advancing age; low income; lack of time; low motivation; rural residency; perception of great effort needed for exercise; overweight or obesity; perception of poor health; and being disabled. Older adults may have additional factors that keep them from being physically active, including lack of social support, lack of transportation to facilities, fear of injury, and cost of programs. Among children ages 4 to 12, the following factors have a positive association with physical activity: gender (boys) ; belief in ability to be active (self -efficacy) ; and parental support . Among adolescents ages 13 to 18, the following factors have a positive association with physical activity: parental education ; gender (boys) ; personal goals ; physical education/school spor ts; belief in ability to be active (self -efficacy) ; and support of friends and family. Environmental influences positively associated with physical activity among children and adolescents include: Presence of sidewalks Having a destination/walking to a particular place Access to public transportation Low traffic density Access to neighborhood or school play area and/or recreational equipment People with disabilities may be less likely to participate in physical activity due to physical, emotional, and psy chological barriers. Barriers may include the inaccessibility of facilities and the lack of staff trained in working with people with disabilities.

Aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of at least 10 minutes, preferably spread throughout the week. Additional health benefits are provided by increasing to 5 hours (300 minutes) a week of moderate - intensity aerobic physical activity, or 2 hours and 30 minutes a week of vigorous -intensity physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both. Older adults (age 65 and older) should follow the adult guidelines. If this is not possible due to limiting chronic conditions, older adults should be as physically active as their abilities allow. They should avoid inactivity. Older adults should do exercises that maintain or improve balan ce if they are at risk of falling. For all individuals, some activity is better than none. Physical activity is safe for almost everyone, and the health benefits of physical activity far outweigh the risks. 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. www.health.gov/PAGuidelines Recommended Levels of Physical Activity A total of 45.0% of Hartford Region adults participate in regular, sustained moderate or vigorous physical activity (meeting physical activity recommendations).

RegionUS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 219 Weight Status About Overweight & Obesity Because weight is influenced by energy (calories) consumed and expended, interventions to improve weight can suppo rt changes in diet or physical activity. They can help change individuals' knowledge and skills, reduce exposure to foods low in nutritional value and high in calories, or increase opportunities for physical activity. Interventions can help prevent unhealthy weight gain or facilitate weight loss among obese people. They can be delivered in multiple settings, including healthcare settings, worksites, or schools. The social and physical factors affecting diet and physical activity (see Physical Activity topi c area) may also have an impact on weight. Obesity is a problem throughout the population. However, among adults, the prevalence is highest for middle -aged people and for non -Hispanic black and Mexican American women. Among children and adolescents, the pr evalence of obesity is highest among older and Mexican American children and non -Hispanic black girls. The association of income with obesity varies by age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Body Mass Index (BMI), wh ich describes relative weight for height, is significantly correlated with total body fat content. The BMI should be used to assess overweight and obesity and to monitor changes in body weight. In addition, measurements of body weight alone can be used to determine efficacy of weight loss therapy. BMI is calculated as weight (kg)/height squared (m2). To estimate BMI using pounds and inches, use: [weight (pounds)/height squared (inches2)] x 703. In this report, overweight is defined as a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2 and obesity as a BMI 30 kg/m2. The rationale behind these definitions is based on epidemiological data that show increases in mortality with BMIs above 25 kg/m2. The increase in mortality, however, tends to be modest until a BMI of 30 kg/m2 is reached. F or persons with a BMI 30 kg/m2, mortality rates from all causes, and especially from cardiovascular disease, are generally increased by 50 to 100 percent above that of persons with BMIs in the range of 20 to 25 kg/m2.

Local markets often do not have fruits, vegetables and healthy meat options. Obesity is often intergenerational and therefore behavior and habits are difficult to change. - Community/Business Leader Our lifestyles. Take a trip to a mall and observe how many fall into the overweight/obese category. Go to a park and compare the number of people being active to the numbers you see in a mall. Look at what we've taken away from school children, recess, modified PE programs. After -school programs focus on academics, and many communities have \"pay to play\" sports prog rams. Marketing dollars COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 228 spent by soda companies overwhelm any prevention education budgets. - Health Provider (Non - Physician) The rates of overweight and obesity in our community are high. - Social Services Representative Current studies of BMI in elementary school children places approximately 30% of children as obese. - Public Health Expert High obesity and diabetes rates. - Physician Access to Healthful Foods The poor and low class citizens of the community do not have access to and cannot afford the m arket prices of fresh fruits and vegetables. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Nutrition is sorely overlooked when attending to patient's chronic needs. Lack of resources available for obese children. Many patients are financially unable to provide balanced meals. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Access to quality food and a basic knowledge about preparing nutritious food. - Health Provider (Non - Physician) Lack of access to high quality, affordable food due to lack of financial resources and lack of qua lity food retail. Lack of safe physical activity opportunities for community members. Low health/nutrition education. Lack of long -term exclusive breastfeeding. - Social Services Representative Poverty. Access to healthy affordable foods. Safe places. Low cost physical activity. Time and childcare. Stress. - Social Services Representative Education Health education regarding proper nutrition and exercise is needed. - Community/Business Leader Lack of any consistent and connected education. There are programs here and there, but education and information for patients on this is very limited. - Physician Education on the issues, understanding why people don't put their health care first, usually because of family, work, children issues and time constra ints. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Early interventions and healthy behaviors should be integrated throughout all aspects of care. Our focus and interventions often exist when disease and complications already exist. Need intense counseling. For th ose insured, there is limited coverage for these interventions. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Nutritional information and access to care and services, particularly for young people. - Community/Business Leader Practicing consistently on living a healt hier life style. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) It all starts there. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Access to Physical Activity Food insecurity. Lack of access to free or low cost recreation. Lack of open spaces. Lack of education. Cultural barriers to diet modification and lack of access to primary care. - Public Health Expert Our communities are not built to support integration of physical activity into daily life like walking to school, grocery store. Too much reliance on prepared foods. Overweight and obesity are leading risk factors for many of our chronic diseases. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Socioeconomic Challenges Socio -economic challenges and stressed neighborhoods often make it difficult for residents to engage in healthful ph ysical activity or purchase healthful/fresh foods. Information about healthy eating/healthy cooking is not consistently available. - Community/Business Leader COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 229 Substance Abuse About Substance Abuse Substance abuse has a major impact on individuals, families, and communities. The effects of substance abuse are cumulative, significantly contributing to costly social, physical, mental, and public health problems. These problems include: Teenage pregnancy Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) Other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) Domestic violence Child abuse Motor vehicle crashes Physical fights Crime Homicide Suicide Substance abuse refers to a set of related conditions associated with the consumption of mind - and behavior -altering substances that have negative behavioral and health outcomes. Social attitudes and political and legal responses to the consumption of alcohol and illicit drugs make substance abuse one of the most complex public health issues. In addition to the considerable health implications, substance abuse has been a flash -point in the criminal justice system and a major focal point in discussions about social values: people argue over whether substance abuse is a disease with genetic and biological foundations or a matter of personal choice. Advances in research have led to the development of evidence -based strategies to effectively address substance abuse. Improvements in brain -imaging technologies and the development of medications that assist in tr eatment have gradually shifted the research community's perspective on substance abuse. There is now a deeper understanding of substance abuse as a disorder that develops in adolescence and, for some individuals, will develop into a chronic illness that wi ll require lifelong monitoring and care. Improved evaluation of community -level prevention has enhanced researchers' understanding of environmental and social factors that contribute to the initiation and abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs, leading to a mo re sophisticated understanding of how to implement evidence -based strategies in specific social and cultural settings. A stronger emphasis on evaluation has expanded evidence -based practices for drug and alcohol treatment. Improvements have focused on the development of better clinical interventions through research and increasing the skills and qualifications of treatment providers.

Tobacco use causes: Cancer Heart disease Lung diseases (including emphysema, bronchitis, and chronic airway obstruction) Premature birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, and infant death There is no risk -free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke causes heart disease and lung cancer in adults and a number of health problems in infants and children, including: severe asthma attacks; respiratory infections; ear infections; and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Smokeless tobacco causes a number of serious oral health problems, including cancer of the mouth and gums, periodontitis, and tooth loss.

People who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk of disease and premature death. Benefits are greater for people who stop at earlier ages, but quitting tobacco use is beneficial at any age. Many factors influence tobacco use, disease, and mortality. Risk factors include race/ethnicity, age, education, and socioeconomic status.

Further, while the focus has been on increasing health insurance coverage, the state of Connecticut has done very little to focus on the access issue or further supporting the care de livery infrastructure necessary as more and more consumers have coverage, causing coverage to be COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 257 confused with access. - Physician Cost and the shortage of primary care physicians. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Insurance and not enough doctors availab le. - Social Services Representative Inadequate access to subspecialty care. - Physician Accessing primary health care, behavioral health and patient navigation within the same facility. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Insurance & Cost of Services There are several challenges related to accessing health care service including affordability. Sometime the basic health care package doesn't cover all the services. Need education. Sometimes the community are not aware of services that are being provided. Accessibility. Service provided in the community are not at the standard care and to get that quality of service may take a person to travel beyond the community to get that care. - Social Services Representative The affordability of health insurance. - Social Services Representative There are a number of individuals that do not have health insurance. Also many residents don't attend regular preventive care appointments and many large community health centers are not accepting new patients for routine care. Transportation is a barrier as well as changing the way people think of about health. - Community/Business Leader Medication costs and access. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Transportation For some, the ability to have adequate transportation is one major factor. In addition, since I work with primarily mono lingual clients, it is difficult when there are no adequate personnel trained to serve as medical interpreters for these clients at medical office, FQHC's, etc. In the Hartford area, to my knowl edge there is only one FQHC on the North end of Hartford, to some clients living in other areas, it is difficult to get there and moreover, whether they will have someone to provide understandable translation services. - Social Services Representative Transportation and compliance. - Social Services Representative Stigma Stigma, lack of resources, lack of education. - Health Provider (Non -Physician) Stigma around and discrimination towards lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals and people liv ing with HIV/AIDS. Lack of understanding and education on the part of health care providers. In some cases, barriers related to health insurance coverage, particularly for transgender individuals. - Social Services Representative Knowledge About Services Lack of knowledge about services. Lack of coordination of care or rather, inability to access coordinated care. - Public Health Expert Ongoing Disease Management Adherence to medications and clear medication regimes to minimize Polypharmacy.

People with a usual source of care have better health outcomes and fewer dispari ties and costs. Having a primary care provider (PCP) as the usual source of care is especially important. PCPs can develop meaningful and sustained relationships with patients and provide integrated services while practicing in the context of family and community. Having a usual PCP is associated with: Greater patient trust in the provider Good patient -provider communication Increased likelihood that patients will receive appropriate care Improving health care services includes increasing access to and use of evidence -based preventive services. Clinical preventive services are services that: prevent illness by detecting early warning signs or symptoms before they develop into a disease (primary prevention); or detect a disease at an earlier, and often more treatable, stage (secondary prevention).

Good oral health improves a person's ability to speak, smile, smell, taste, touch, chew, swal low, and make facial expressions to show feelings and emotions. However, oral diseases, from cavities to oral cancer, cause pain and disability for many Americans. Good self -care, such as brushing with fluoride toothpaste, daily flossing, and professional treatment, is key to good oral health. Health behaviors that can lead to poor oral health include: tobacco use; excessive alcohol use; and poor dietary choices . The significant improvement in the oral health of Americans over the past 50 years is a public health success story. Most of the gains are a result of effective prevention and treatment efforts. One major success is community water fluoridation, which now benefits about 7 out of 10 Americans who get water through public water systems. However, some Americans do not have access to preventive programs. People who have the least access to preventive services and dental treatment have greater rates of oral diseases. A person's ability to access oral healthcare is associated with factors such as educatio n level, income, race, and ethnicity. Barriers that can limit a person's use of preventive interventions and treatments include: limited access to and availability of dental services; lack of awareness of the need for care; cost; and fear of dental procedures. There are also social determinants that affect oral health. In general, people with lower levels of education and income, and people from specific racial/ethnic groups, have higher rates of disease. People with disabilities and other health conditions, like diabetes, are more likely to have poor oral health. Potential strategies to address these issues include: Implementing and evaluating activities that have an impact on health behavior. Promoting interventions to reduce tooth decay, such as dental sealants and fluoride use. Evaluating and improving methods of monitoring oral diseases and conditions. Increasing the capacity of State dental health programs to provide preventive oral health services. Increasing the number of community health centers with an oral health component.
