It was developed under the Private FinanceInitiative to replace the previous National Insurance Recording System(NIRS 1). The Contributions Agency, then part of the Department of SocialSecurity, was responsible for the development project. Following acompetition, the Agency awarded the NIRS 2 contract to Accenture - thenAndersen Consulting - in 1995. The contract covered the replacement ofNIRS 1, transfer of data to the new system, development of the system toimplement legislative changes arising from the Pensions Act 1995, and theoperation of the new system until 2004. 2 In 1998 the Government proposed significant changes to pensions and national insurance legislation, for example to introduce stakeholder pensions andpension sharing on divorce. The Inland Revenue, who had taken overresponsibility for NIRS 2 in April 1999 with the transfer of the ContributionsAgency, negotiated an extension to the contract to cover the work needed tosupport these legislative changes. The original contract was valued at\u00a345 million for operational services with provision for software enhancementsincreasing that to \u00a376 million. The estimated value of the extension is between\u00a370 million and \u00a3144 million, depending on the amount of work ordered overthe remaining life of the contract. On the basis of development work orderedand planned to date, the Department's current estimate is for substantially lessthan \u00a3144 million (Figure 1) . 1National Insurance Recording System contracts !Social Security Act 1998!Replacement of NIRS 1 !Transfer of data !Implement legislative changes from Pensions Act 1995 !Allow for other change foreseen in 1995!Implement legislative changes since 1998 !Allow for further major change up to 2004NIRS2 Contract \u00a345 - 76 millionNIRS2 Contract Extension \u00a370 - 144 million !Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000!Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 19992executive summaryNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION 3 We carried out a study of the extension to the NIRS 2 contract in order to ascertain: !why the Department needed to contract for additional development workbeyond the scope of the original contract; !what options were available to the Department for carrying out theadditional work, and how these options were evaluated; !how the Department evaluated the proposal submitted by Accenture in theabsence of open competition; !whether risks were shared appropriately between the parties to the contract;and !what steps the Department had taken to ensure that the problems arisingunder the original contract are not repeated during the course of theadditional work. 4 We decided to issue this report for two reasons: !to consider, on the basis of the NIRS 2 experience, the extent to which private finance initiative (PFI) contracts can provide the flexibility toaccommodate changes in government programmes and practice that flowfrom government policy developments; and !to review developments on the NIRS 2 contract with Accenture followingour initial examination 1and the subsequent reports by the Committee of Public Accounts.2NIRS 2 is a major project, supporting the Inland Revenue's administration of the national insurance scheme, holding detailsof 65 million national insurance contributors and calculating benefits andother amounts payable, such as state pensions. A project of this size andimportance is a matter of continuing public and Parliamentary interest. 5 The report does not cover the implementation or operation of the original system, progress with which is being monitored as part of our annual audits ofthe National Insurance Fund account. 1 HC12, Session 1997-98 2 The contract to develop and update the replacement national insurance recording system (46th Report, Session 1997-98 (HC472))Delays to the new national insurance recording system (22nd Report, Session 1998-99 (HC 182))National Insurance Fund 1998-99 (31st Report, Session 350))3executive summaryNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION The original NIRS 2 contract proved insufficiently flexible in catering for the significant legislative changes to pensions andnational insurance proposed by the Government in 1998 6 The original NIRS 2 contract included provision for system development work to meet foreseeable legislative changes. There was an annual limit to the quantity ofsystem enhancements which could be ordered at the agreed price, based on theContributions Agency's experience in operating the previous National InsuranceRecording System. The pricing arrangements for system enhancements werefinalised after the contract award. 7 In 1998, the government proposed changes to pensions and national insurance legislation on a scale which considerably exceeded the level expected when thecontract was agreed. The Department of Social Security had provided advice toMinisters on the technical feasibility and costs of each of the policy changes. Theimplications of each policy were, however, assessed separately, and theDepartment's ability to assess the capacity of NIRS 2 to accommodate the overallpackage of changes within the proposed legislative timetable was limited byuncertainties about the initial stabilisation of the system, and the lack of clarityaround the timescales for these changes. This meant that they were not in aposition to establish fully the aggregate effect of the changes on NIRS 2. 8 At the point when the Inland Revenue took over responsibility for NIRS 2, it was unclear whether the contract contained sufficient headroom to cater for thedevelopment work needed. They therefore worked with the Department ofSocial Security, Accenture and EDS to determine the volume of new workrequired by the legislative changes, for which responsibility was now sharedbetween the two departments, and the feasibility of delivering it throughNIRS 2. The Inland Revenue concluded that the scale of the new work exceededthe contract limit and decided to examine how best to meet the commitments. The extension of the NIRS 2 contract 9 The Inland Revenue looked at alternatives to using NIRS 2 to support the new legislative requirements, including clerical solutions and using otherinformation technology systems. Most of these were rejected because theywere not technically feasible or likely to involve greater risk or cost thanenhancing NIRS 2. They concluded that NIRS 2 was the most practicableoption for some 80 per cent of the work required.4executive summaryNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION 10 The Inland Revenue had three main contractual options for commissioning the new NIRS 2 development work: !to negotiate a contract extension; !to ask Accenture to provide the additional resources required atDepartment of Social Security framework rates, under the original contractterms; !to exercise the break clause in the original contract and hold a newcompetition for the continuing operation and development of the system. 11 They opened discussions with Accenture about extending the contract. In response, Accenture offered to deliver all development work using a dedicatedsoftware support facility. Doing this and introducing longer-term planning ofresource requirements would enable them to offer a lower price forenhancements than the Department of Social Security framework rates, whichwere the alternative charging mechanism. 12 The Inland Revenue then commissioned PA Consulting to develop a financial model to compare the cost of Accenture's proposals with that of usingalternative suppliers. The work showed that Accenture's unit costs comparedclosely with the comparators, but breaking the NIRS 2 contract would haveincurred additional costs estimated at \u00a344 million. The results thereforesupported the option to extend the contract with Accenture. 13 In addition to the financial evaluation, the Inland Revenue assessed Accenture's ability to deliver software of the required quality, the firm'scommercial stability, legal, commercial and security issues, the legislativetimetable, and the scope to improve their management of development work.After taking these factors into account, as well as a technical review of NIRSand latest Treasury guidance the Inland Revenue concluded that a contractextension provided the best option for meeting the legislative requirements inthe timescale required. 14 The Inland Revenue used the extension to the contract to introduce new operating arrangements to resolve difficulties arising on the original contractwhich had contributed to delays in implementing the system. In doing so, theyobtained legal advice that the extension complied with European procurementrules in all respects other than that the new payment arrangements to improvetheir control of development work did not strictly adhere to the terms of theoriginal procurement advertisement. The advice recognised that this might giverise to claims for compensation from other suppliers, but that the risk ofchallenge was extremely low. However, the alternatives would not haveallowed them to meet the timetable prescribed by new pensions legislation,which was already in force. They decided to proceed, as they considered thatthe costs of delaying the work programme and the advantages of the revisedarrangements outweighed the risks attached to not complying fully with theprocurement rules.5executive summaryNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION 15 Under the new arrangements, Accenture continue to bear risks relating to the operation and availability of the system. The risks associated with system enhance-ments, however, are shared to a greater extent than under the original contract. Thecontract extension has introduced stage payments linked to the achievement ofmilestones, productivity incentives, and profit sharing arrangements. 16 The Inland Revenue have recognised that, in any relationship of this kind, it is not possible to transfer the business risk of non-delivery to the contractor. Theyhave therefore strengthened arrangements for managing delivery risks byintroducing their own project management methodology to the contract. Thisincludes a system that ensures developments to the system are managed as aseries of projects, which are overseen centrally and allocated a specific releasedate linked to the legislative timetable. There are joint working arrangements tosecure increased collaboration and acceptance criteria are defined moreclearly than before. The management arrangements for the contract extensioncorrespond closely to subsequent government guidance on risk management inPFI contracts and IT projects. 17 The Inland Revenue and Accenture consider that their relationship has improved since the contract extension, due to the introduction and operationof partnership principles. Both sides describe the current relationship as open,trusting and effective in managing the contract, and have seen advantagesaccruing since the new arrangements were introduced. System changesrequired to support pensions sharing on divorce, changes in bereavement andincapacity benefits and the restructuring of national insurance contributionshave been delivered successfully. The Inland Revenue reported that the NIRS 2service had improved significantly since the new arrangements had come intooperation and user satisfaction increased substantially. In the 12 months to31 March 2001 service levels had consistently exceeded target performanceand 2 major releases of high quality software had been made on schedule.6executive summaryNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION 18 The key points arising from our examination are as follows: On the need for an extension and the lessons for Departments a The original NIRS 2 contract between the Department of Social Security and Accenture included flexibility to cater for legislative change then planned, an agreed annual volume of additional development work and routine enhancements. Butthe scale of change arising from new legislation in 1998 was considerably beyond the level expected when the contract wasagreed, and exceeded the levels allowed for in the contract. Departments should consider whether contracts should include specific mechanisms to deal with major enhancements of this nature. This might involve the reintroduction of competition orinviting the bidders to propose a separate pricing structure for major enhancements as part of the initial tendering process. b The Department of Social Security did not assess the aggregate impact of the proposed policy changes and their timing on NIRS 2 development capacity. At the point when responsibility for the system was transferred to the Inland Revenue, neitherDepartment had a clear view of whether there was the technical or contractual capacity to deliver the changes using thesystem. In advising Ministers on the implications for existing information technology systems of fixing deadlines for major legislative change, Departments need to understand the impact on their systems, individually and in aggregate, and developstrategies to manage the resulting risks. c When the original NIRS 2 contract was concluded in 1995, there was little experience of the Private Finance Initiative and none in the field of information technology. An information technology procurement contract of this scale and complexitypresented challenges in estimating the size of the requirement and developing pricing strategies which had not arisen inother Private Finance Initiative deals at the time. The Government have produced substantial additional guidance on sucharrangements since 1999, in the light of experience with this and other contracts, which includes the following advice: !Change control, and similar procedures should be agreed at the outset and allow open discussion about the volume andcost of developments. Contracts should set out clearly how acceptance will be defined. !Departments should avoid agreements to agree in key areas of contracts. The latter point is particularly important because attempts to conclude such agreements may be complicated, difficult and expensive and, in the extreme, may result in a material diminution in the value of a contract to a Department. On the contract extension d A contract extension offered better value for money to the Inland Revenue to deliver the required enhancements within the timescale required than the alternatives available. e In deciding to implement the new contractual arrangements, the Inland Revenue took into account legal advice that the new payment arrangements might leave them vulnerable to claims for compensation. As the risk of challenge was extremelylow they decided to proceed in order to meet the proposed timetable for new pensions legislation and to secureimprovements in their control of development work. Legislative timetables should be set so that Departments can implement changes while complying with other legal requirements. f The Inland Revenue contract management arrangements for the extension adhere closely to current guidance on risk management in PFI contracts and information technology projects. Had this guidance been available at the time, it wouldhave led to contractual and operating arrangements considerably different from those originally adopted for NIRS 2. Risksassociated with enhancements to the system are shared to a greater extent than under the original contract. The newarrangements have achieved improvements in the relationship between the parties and in the delivery of systemenhancements, addressing weaknesses identified by the Committee of Public Accounts.Conclusions and recommendations "}
